PORTRAIT FROM
A NUBIAN TOMB
This is the head of a man who lived
and died in Nubia nearly 4,000 years
ago. It is one of several funerary
masks recovered from a necropolis
near Mirgissa, in the Sudan, by a
French archaeological mission
which took part in the international
campaign to save the monuments
of Nubia. Following a Unesco
appeal (launched in 1960), 40
archaeological missions from 15
countries explored sites in Egyptian
Nubia for five years, while a dozen
more worked in Sudanese Nubia.

A 21-YEAR
ANTHOLOGY
"Ignorance of each other's ways and
lives," reads the preamble of the
Constitution of Unesco, "has been
a common cause throughout the history
of mankind of that suspicion and mis¬
trust between peoples of the world
through which their differences have
all too often broken into war." For
the past 21 years the "Unesco Cour¬
ier" has sought by text and image
to combat this suspicion and mistrust
between peoples by telling the un-
headlined story of men and women
of different lands who are working
together to conquer ignorance and dis¬
ease, reduce racial prejudice, raise
standards of living and foster better
understanding of other peoples' ways
and lives: in a word, to serve as a
window opening on the world of educ¬
ation, the sciences, the arts, and com¬
munication, and the problems concern¬
ing the nations of the globe in seeking
to resolve them.
The "Unesco Courier" began pub¬
lication in 1948 with three language
editions in English, French and Spanish.
It has steadily grown until today it is
proud to boast a total of 12 language
editions all identical in content and
presentation with a readership ex¬
ceeding 2 million persons. A Russian
edition was launched in Moscow in
1957; a German edition in Berne and
an Arabic edition in Cairo were launch¬
ed in 1960; a Japanese edition began
publication in Tokyo in 1961; and an
Italian edition in Rome in 1963; a Hindi
edition in New Delhi in 1967 and a
Tamil edition in Madras the same year;
and a Hebrew edition in Jerusalem in
1968. A Persian edition produced in
Teheran has been launched in 1969.
This special issue brings together a
necessarily small selection of the many
articles and features that have appear¬
ed in the past two decades. It is in
no sense a history of Unesco. All
articles have been shortened, some¬
times drastically, and many articles
have had to be omitted though they
certainly deserve a place in this
anthology.

<![CDATA[
BI Y his own Ingenuity, Homo
sapiens, the Earthling, has shrunk his
world to the dimensions of a very
small planet. In the arrogance of our
conceit, which puts Man and his brain
at the very centre of the universe, we
have never been quite convinced by
the astronomers when they have tried
to tell us how insignificant the world
is in the immensities of Space. But
now the space engineers, and the
astronauts, beating the bounds of our
global parish, have reminded us how
relatively small it is.
In the spirit of new adventure, one
may regard the world as a departure
platform for fugitives to the moon or a
launching pad for escapades to other
planets or even beyond our solar sys¬
tem, into other universes. But the
Earthlings who cannot so escape must
recognize that on its relatively limited
surface, 3,000 million people today,
4,000 million in twenty years' time, and
6,000 million or 7,000 million forty years
from now, will have to contrive to live
and to work together. Or, by the ne¬
glect of wisdom or the abuse of human
ingenuity, to die together.
An eye, human or electronic, in an
artificial satellite in orbit, sees no poli¬
tical frontiers; no Ideological curtains;
and no differentiation of races. It
might see H-Bombs going off as the
signals of tensions; but in general it
would see a globe of which only three-
tenths was land and seven-tenths
covered by oceans; mountain ranges
reduced to wrinkles; evidence of sur¬
viving forests; tawny expanses of hot
deserts which cover a fifth of its sur¬
face and cold deserts which cover an-
LORD RITCHIE-CALDER is a world famous
science writer. He won the Unesco Kalinga
Prize for the popularization of science in 1961.
other fifth. It might with difficulty dis¬
tinguish the pattern of cultivation of
arable or cropped lands, which
accounts for only one-tenth of the
land surface. That Is the nature of
humanity's family estate of which, at
the moment, we are the improvident
stewards.
The world is not just the relic of a
cosmic incident. It provides the bio¬
sphere, the living space, for the evolu¬
tionary process which, we like to think,
had its consummation in Man.
But with a wisdom which we have
not demonstrated convincingly so far,
we must recognize that that biosphere
and that evolutionary process include
other species with which we can co¬
exist or which we can stupidly destroy.
Stupidly because our relations with
these other species are a condition of
our own survival.
A lump of soil no bigger than a
football contains a micro-organic popu¬
lation greater than the human popula¬
tion of the world. That micro-organic
population includes the germs and
fungi which evocatively suggest dis¬
ease or danger but which, in other
forms, are indispensable to our exis¬
tence. In the same way, we think of
insects as deserving insecticide and
other creatures as deserving pesticide,
but in the process we can kill those
which are essential to our ultimate
needs.
In order to get margarine, we cleared
big areas in Africa of brush and tsetse
flies which it harboured, but In the
process we got rid of the bees which
were needed to pollinate other crops.
Similarly, for our short-term, and
short-sighted, needs we have des¬
troyed the vegetation cover, prevent¬
ing the absorption of water by the
natural sponge through which it seeps
into the underground springs. As a
result the scouring rains sluice the
soil off the hills, cause floods and
eventual erosion.
In the lifetime of the United States,
over two hundred and eighty million
acres of arable crop and range land
have been destroyed more than ten
times the productive acreage of the
United Kingdom.
Only slowly and recently have we
come to recognize that wild animals
are not something with which mankind
is at war but a part of the balance of
life, which is delicately adjusted.
For the first time in history, man has
the power of veto over the evolution
of his species. We share the bio¬
sphere. Into t&at we have injected, in
the past sixteen years, man-made
radioactivity. Elements which did not
exist in nature have been indiscrim¬
inately scattered over the face of the
earth, to combine in all living things.
Today there is not a child in the
world that does not have radiostron-
tium in its bones at least to some
degree. The amounts may be insigni¬
ficant and the possible effects may be
emotionally exaggerated and medically
in dispute. Much is unproven, much
is unknown. But that only emphasizes
that men, on defective evidence or in
positive ignorance, are recklessly tam¬
pering with the biosphere on which
their present and future depends.
I have, in the past fourteen years,
been among the wandering Bedouins
in the desert, the Dyaks of Equatorial
Borneo, the Eskimos in the Arctic, the
peoples of the hinterlands of Latin
America and Africa and Asia. In one
way or another their lives and their
destinies have been consciously
touched by scientific and techno¬
logical achievement.
Many of them have acquired their
freedom in 1962 there are nearly
twice as many nations in the U.N. as
there were when it was founded. But
when the intoxicating effects of politi¬
cal independence wear off, there is
the morning-after-the-night-before.
People are apt to wake up and dis¬
cover that freedom has been robbed
of its meaning; that they are just as
hungry, or more hungry; just as poor,
or more impoverished; just as sick or
more disease-ridden, and just as frus¬
trated in their seeking for a better
way of life.
IHROUGH the limitedfin¬
ancially that is activities of the U.N.
agencies, of the U.N. expanded techni¬
cal assistance fund and now of the
special fund and by the much more
lavish examples of bilateral aid, people
have been shown what is scientifically
and technically possible. But it is not
enough to show them.
To demonstrate what might be done
to people who have not the means to
do it is just tantalizing. It is just
"window-shopping" walking along
with nothing in your pocket and with
plateglass between you and the things
you have been taught to want.
The peoples of the emerging coun¬
tries have not the means to go shopp¬
ing in the supermarket of science as
Prof. P.M.S. Blackett has termed it.
They cannot even afford the bargain
basement.
The object of this kind of assistance
is to help people to help themselves
throwing them a rope with which to
haul themselves out of the morass of
poverty. But this is no Indian rope-
trick the rope has to be tethered to
something, and a winch would help to
haul them out more quickly. As it is,
the rope is slipping.
After ten years of this new social
philosophy by which governments
acknowledged that they were respon¬
sible, not only for their own people,
but for other, less fortunate peoples as
well, the gap between the prosperity
of the highly-advanced countries and n
the poverty of the countries struggling **
for development has not closed it has

widened. The rich countries are richer
and the poor countries are poorer
despite the thousands of millions
which have been spent on aid.
Governments, when the markets
skid, cannot "lift themselves by their
own bootstraps" or, if they do, it is
by duress. In the meantime their
peoples will endure the Misery-Go-
Round of Poverty.
By 1960 the total world stocks of
surplus grain had reached the in¬
credible figure of 125,000,000 tons-
enough to provide the full calorie
needs of 450,000,000 people for a com¬
plete year.
NI O one should be so foolish
as to think that the distribution of those
vast surpluses, even if it were possible,
would solve the problem of hunger.
Relieving immediate stresses, yes. By
distribution through such agencies as
Unicef, yes. By turning food into
currency, yes. Supplies of food can
be made available to governments to
help present needs and the proceeds
can be used by a government to help
its own agriculture to increase its
yields in future years. That is the only
permanent solution to enable coun¬
tries and regions to produce their food
requirements.
It can be done. We do not need to
imagine food artificially produced by
photosynthesis. The scientific know-
how already exists. The knowledge
we have got, applied with wisdom, can
increase the yields from existing
acreages. By plant-breeding we can
extend the food-growing acreages into
what seemed inhospitable regions.
The Unesco Arid Zone Programme
has done remarkable work in showing
how deserts might be developed. I
have no doubt, having been in the
Arctic seeing whether it might become
part of our habitable world, that pro¬
duction, if need be, can be extended
there.
As far as those oceans which cover
seven-tenths of our globe are concern¬
ed, we are at the cave-man stage.
At sea we hunt our food and do not
husband it. Sea-farming and sea-
ranching are perfectly feasible.
The great international survey of the
Indian Ocean, sponsored by Unesco,
in which 25 survey ships of 15 nations
took part, not only told us a great deal
about that birthplace of the monsoons
but also about its biological possibi¬
lities and its food prospects.
In 1961, the United Nations held in
Rome a conference on "New Sources
of Energy". Ironically, atomic energy
was never mentioned. The new
sources were the oldest of all sun,
wind and geothermal energy, the heat
6 in the crust of the earth. It was a
"Do-it-yourself" conference telling
the developing countries how they
might contrive, improvise, and adapt
methods of harnessing the sun and the
winds to their domestic and industrial
needs.
For the first t!me in history, Man,
the Earthling, has the power of veto
over continuing evolution. He can
exercise that veto by the nuclear des¬
truction of the race, or, by default in
handling the problems of starvation,
prove that Malthus was right.
He can ambitiously reach out to the
farther planets, but his species as such
must survive on the surface of the
earth, subsist from the nine inches of
top-soil which feeds, clothes and
shelters him or from the seas from
which he emerged hundreds of millions
of years ago.
All the majesty of his mind can be
dethroned by his stomach. Man can
feast like Belshazzar and ignore the
writing on the wall. He can spend
£40,000 million a year on the defence
of peace and ignore the real content
of the peace he is supposed to be
defending.
He can split the atom and release
the power of matter and use this, his
greatest discovery, to poison the good¬
ness of his earth and destroy his
species. He can outboast the An¬
cients, who in the arrogance of their
material success built pyramids as the
gravestones of their civilizations, for
Modern Man can throw his pyramids
into Space and they may orbit etern¬
ally around a planet which died of his
neglect.
Or he may choose to use his science
and his wisdom to co-operate with all
his kind in the peaceful enrichment of
his Earth and of the people who live
on it.

THE STORY
II traveller approaching the
Colombian port of Barranquilla on the
Caribbean Sea sees Colombian soil
long before he sights the coast.
The tropical blue of the sea changes
to yellow as far as the eye can reach.
What gives it its yellow colour?
The port of Barranquilla lies on the
estuary of the River Magdalena, which
rises in the interior of Colombia and
flows for a thousand miles to empty
into the Caribbean Sea. The yellow
colour is soil swept away by the Mag¬
dalena River within a radius of several
miles round the port of Barranquilla.
The soil comes from the Magdalena
Valley and from the slopes of the
Andes enclosing the valley to the east
and west. It has been washed away
by rain and borne down brooks, tribu¬
taries and secondary rivers.
Part of it has been stripped by the
River Magdalena from its own banks.
Every day, every hour, even every
minute, the wealth of a nation is cast
into the sea.
Antonio Arango, whom I knew in the
Andean Cordillera, was himself an
actor in the tragedy of the vanishing
soil, without understanding it.
Antonio Arango invested his life-
savings in the purchase of a 20-hectare

National Education in Colombia, is now

<![CDATA[
OF ANTONIO ARANGO
parcel of land in the Cordillera. The
land was rich and fertile and covered
with "tall timber". "Where such big
trees grow", said Antonio to himself,
"the soil Is good", and he gazed with
satisfaction at the thick stratum of top-
soil which could be seen in the cutting
made by the brook. The water was
crystal-clear as it flowed through the
undergrowth of moss and parasitic
plants; so crystalline that Antonio and
his sons christened it "Diamond
Brook". The site was ideal for a house
and allowed a view over the whole
landscape.
Antonio Arango sharpened his axe
and machette. His wife and three sons
aiding him, he began felling the tall
trees. The timber could not be used
because there were no roads to trans¬
port it nor neighbouring towns to buy
it. So Antonio Arango let a few days
go by to let the sun dry the fallen
trunks and then set fire to them.
Other settlers were doing the same
in other parts of the mountain.
The blaze was enormous, and the
beasts and birds of the forest fled
before the flames as the fallen giants
crackled in the fire.
At last the ground was cleared and
Antonio Arango sowed it with maize.
On two hectares he sowed forage for
the cow, and built a house on the high
ground. As his wife had worked so
hard, Antonio gave his ranch her name,
La Isabella. The first harvest was a
big success. The maize was tall and
thick. Antonio was pleased with his
efforts. So he went on sowing maize.
But things began to change.
Diamond Brook, which had once
been crystal-clear throughout the year,
had shrunk to a thread of water in
summer. In the rainy season it was a
yellow flood tearing loose rocks and
mud and lumps of soil. The harvests
grew smaller, and Antonio Arango had
to sell the cow because the pasture
land could no longer feed the animal.
Things were not going right at all.
One day, when he was sowing maize,
his mattock struck solid rock. The
vegetable top-soil had become so thin
that rocky outcrops were appearing
everywhere. Antonio had no money,
the children had nothing to eat, and
finally Diamond Brook vanished and
only its stony channel was left. Like
so many other settlers, Antonio Arango
left to find another stretch of woodland
to start all over again.
This tragedy of Antonio Arango is
attaining national, continental and
world-wide proportions. Every year
Colombia loses the equivalent of
10,000 ranches of 20 hectares by soil
erosion. That means that every year
there are 10,000 families in the same
position as the Arangos.
Vegetation is like an umbrella pro-
Ay Guillermo Nannetti
tecting the soil. It breaks the fall of
the water and causes it to sink into
the subsoil. The forest is the mother
of the spring. The roots of the trees
are like friendly hands sustaining the
topsoil with their myriad fingers. Fallen
leaves and fruits fertilize the soil and
build up the vegetable humus. The
trees afford protection from the wind,
regulate humidity and give shelter from
heat and cold. They prevent floods.
They purify the air. They can be an
inexhaustible source of profit to one
who knows how to cultivate and utilize
them wisely.
If only someone had told Antonio
Arango to drive his furrows according
to the contour of the slope. To terrace
the steepest part of the slope. To heal
the scars of erosion with simple dams
of logs and stones.
If only someone had told Antonio
Arango that maize is not the right crop
for sloping ground and that other,
better paying crops can be rotated
instead. If only someone had taught
him to sow the ground between his
furrows with suitable bushes to check
the movement of the soil.
And if only all the Antonio Arangos,
all the N'boyas, Changs, Abdullas and
Smiths all over the world knew some¬
thing about the conservation of na¬
ture, what a different world it would be.
My 1949
SAVING OUR VANISHING FORESTS
by Karl Heinz Oedekoven
A, S far back as the un¬
known origin of mankind, the path of
human activity has been marked by
the thoughtless destruction of forest
and vegetation. Civilizations have
flourished and disappeared with a re¬
sultant depletion of trees and plants,
leaving only steppe and desert behind.
Only in recent centuries has man
begun to realize that he was cutting
off the branch that he was sitting on.
Man is becoming more aware today
of nature's vengeance and, at the same
time, of the challenge which confronts
him in preserving his dwindling natural
assets while endeavouring to extend
the fertile earth which is the very basis
of his existence. The demands of an
ever increasing world population make
KARL HEINZ OEDEKOVEN of the Federal
Republic of Germany Is a specialist on world
forestry at the Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion, and is former vice-chairman of the
European Forestry Commission.
his task more and more insistent.
The forest, our largest and most
durable soil cover, was once regarded
as only an obstacle to settlement, agri¬
culture and communications. It was
recklessly burned or exploited until it
suddenly became a focus of intense
human interest.
Man has come to learn that the two
most important elements of his exis¬
tence soil and water owe their stabi¬
lity and availability to the presence of
sufficient forest cover.
Three-quarters of the world's popu¬
lation are undernourished. There is
only about one acre of land per head
for food production and no less than
twice this area is needed to ensure
satisfactory nutrition. The true Enemy
No. 1 in the world is not a political or
military opponent, but the deterioration
of the soil, the dryness, the irresistible
progress of semi-deserts and deserts.
In some countries, like the United
States and the Union of Soviet Social¬
ist Republics, soil conservation has
become almost a "State religion". In
South America, all over Africa, Asia
and Australia there is great concern
over dangers threatening the soil.
While political leaders come and go,
this destructive process of soil deter¬
ioration remains a permanent menace.
Each government inherits this problem
from its predecessor. Yet, even to¬
day, the efforts of many countries to
remedy the situation are merely in
their infancy.
We know from the experience of
500 years that the Sahara desert pro¬
gresses towards the south at the rate
of over three feet a year on a wide
front of 2,000 miles. Lake Chad,
which some decades ago was still an
ideal refuge for migrating birds from
Europe, Is steadily diminishing in sur¬
face area and depth and its shores
are turning from fertile green to steppe
brown. All far-reaching plans for the
development of Africa as the "Conti¬
nent of the Future", all plans for water
use and industrialization will fail unless
the necessary attention is paid to the "J
importance of trees and forests. I

tor. The one in the south reaches
from Australia to South Africa and
South America. The one in the nor¬
thern hemisphere spreads north from
China, all across Asia, North America
and Mexico.
The northern belt includes those na¬
tions which, as we learned in our
history classes at school, were once
rulers of the world. We were puzzled
to hear in geography class that large
areas of these once powerful nations
are now sterile. The truth is, of
course, that in ancient times they
were not so.
Ctesiphon and Baghdad, once cen¬
tres of concentrated power, were des¬
cribed by Herodotus more than two
thousand years ago: "Of all the coun¬
tries we know this is the most suitable
for growing grain. It is so well fav¬
oured that it yields two hundredfold
and, where conditions are best, even
three hundredfold. The ears of wheat
and barley grow to the width of four
fingers. But to the height of what tree
millet and barley grow I shall not dis¬
close. No one who has not seen
Babylon would believe me."
For Herodotus, Babylon was the
essence of fertility. He also accorded
the same honour to Cinyps, a region in
North Africa: "This country produces
grain equal to the best I have seen,
for it has black soil and springs water
it. The yield is equal to that of Baby¬
lon, three hundredfold under the best
conditions."
Soldiers in the sandy and torrid
conditions of this region (part of mod¬
ern Cyrenaica) during the last war
would have had difficulty in imagining
that a now desolate desert was the
richest of farming land two millennia
ago.
T,

HERE are three zones on
the globe which successively were
homes of dominating civilizations but
where the soil became devastated in
proportion to theageoftheirsettlement.
The first zone is the desert of North
Africa. In the Sahara, hundreds of
archaelogical finds and cave paintings
indicate that this was once a flour¬
ishing country of many lakes and
rivers. One cave painting shows men
swimming. Imagine swimmers in the
Sahara desert today!
A second zone is the continuous
range of stone, salt and sand deserts
which spread from west China, across
Turkestan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Jor¬
dan, Sinai and up to North Africa. In
ancient times these latitudes were
inhabited by Sumerians, Babylonians,
Persians, Macedonians, and Phoeni¬
cians names which are all connected
with world power and wealth. The
third zone covers Palestine, Syria, Asia
Minor, Greece, Italy and Spain.
This epidemic of devastated soil
seems to be a contagious one.
Attempts at reafforestation in Spain,
Italy and Greece would certainly have
been more successful had the opposite
shores of the Mediterranean still been
covered with a wide belt of fertile land
as once they were. But the terrible
desert has already reached the shore
of the Mediterranean on a wide front
and sends out its drying winds to the
European countries.
The ever-blue sky of Italy has not
always been as blue. Some 2,000
years ago it was just as grey and
cloudy as in northern parts of Europe
and the complaints of the old Romans
about frost and snow-fall which seem
so strange to those who know Italy
today were probably justified.
While once it took millennia, or at
least centuries to deplete fertile land,
modern history offers a striking exam¬
ple of how man can start and complete
this disastrous chain-reaction in only a
few decades. Hardly a century ago
the U.S. farmer moved into the Middle
West, full of initiative and energy.
At first, the existing forests seemed
inexhaustible. They were cut down,
houses and bridges were built, the
wood was burned in locomotives, on
ships and in stoves. Great quantities
were felled and burned on the spot to
make large areas of ash-fertilized farm¬
ing land. Later, monocultures and
tractors cleared away those clumps of
trees and hedges which had survived.
Water ran off the land too rapidly,
soil was eroded, floods occurred and
drought appeared between rainy peri¬
ods. This process was accelerated
during the First World War when large
areas of what remained of tree-covered
prairie were ploughed up for more in¬
tensive wheat production.
After the war, part of this land was
left idle, but there was no longer any
deep-rooting grass or other soil cover
to conserve the moisture and stabilize
the soil. Storms swept the land from
the Gulf of México and Canada un¬
checked, for there were no forests to
break their force. The wind carried
away the fertile topsoil leaving only
sterile layers and rocks.
The same thing happened to former
forest areas. Without the protection
of the trees, without the firm grip of
their roots, without humus, the soil was
carried away. In the south, where the
frost which usually stabilizes the soil
during winter seldom occurs, and
where there is seldom snow cover to
prevent the damage, soil and wind
erosion had the same harmful effect.
Like a network of veins the first
small gullies appeared in the soil,
gradually deepening to real gorges.
The process was repeated a million
times all over the country until only
naked rock was left in some regions.
Even today American rivers carry
away so much fertile soil that an old
Indian once said: "Our country is a
new Atlantis; one day it will disappear
in the Ocean!"
Erosion is only the first phase of a
serious chain reaction which starts
with the regression or disappearance
of forests. Sediment deposited in
reservoirs, water-courses, fields and
cities is an important part of the total
damage. This damage seldom comes to
public attention because it is often invi¬
sible. Sediment increases the total
volume and weight of flow in water¬
courses thus raising the height of flood
peaks and their destructive power. In
drainage basins and reservoirs, sedi¬
ment can reduce water capacity in a
short time.
Investigations made
into the effect of silting on the capacity
of dams in Algeria show several dams
lost 100 per cent of their original capac¬
ity in a period of 74 to 96 years. Simil¬
ar findings in the United States with
respect to annual storage depletion in
numerous dams indicate that from 0.09
to 31.53 per cent of original storage
capacity is lost as a result of silting.
Recently a monograph on the Arno
river basin, on which Florence is lo¬
cated, revealed that 2,670,000 tons of
solid material are carried away an¬
nually by the water flow, thus causing
an average lowering of land surface
of almost one inch a year. -
Silting is almost always associated
with deforestation. Dams fed from
completely wooded watersheds practi¬
cally never silt up. Experiments carried
out by the Tennessee Valley Authority
in 1955 showed that after reafforesta¬
tion and protection works had been
completed, the volume of sediment
carried down by the river was reduced
by 90 per cent.
The forest also plays an important
part in protecting the soil against wind
erosion and sand encroachment. Dune
stabilization by tree planting is a well-
kncOvn practice in many parts of the
world. It is true that almost any vege¬
tation cover will stabilize loose soil and
prevent it from being eroded by wind
and rain, but forests are probably more
effective because of their height, den¬
sity, deep-reaching roots and perma¬
nency. There are indications that the
presence of forests may increase local
rainfall, though effects on a regional or
continental scale have not been de¬
monstrated.
The denser the forest, the greater
will be its power to reduce wind velo¬
city. One authority has proved this
protective effect and noted reductions
in velocity of over 85 per cent. In
Italy, tests have shown that the Cecina
forest reduced wind velocity by 56 per
cent and a hardwood coppice in the
same region was responsible for re¬
ductions of 89 per cent.
The importance of such protection
against wind erosion can hardly be
exaggerated. In dry periods and on
bare land the particles of certain types
of soil become so severed from each
other that a strong wind can easily
carry them away. The finer particles
form clouds and the coarser particles,
whipped by the wind, roll and bounce

over the surface of the soil. Their
movement is halted whenever the wind
slackens and they bank up in pits,
ditches, canals and sunken roads, or
in the neighbourhood of sheltering
objects where they may suffocate
crops.
This is only one of the perils of
strong winds. Drying out of soil, di¬
rect damage to delicate products like
fruit, and the distortion and stunting
of exposed trees can all be traced to
this cause.
It is a striking fact that a number
of countries have never formulated a
forest policy or passed a forest law,
in spite of evident symptoms of soil
deterioration and in spite of repeated
warnings about the results of a further
decline.
One of them comes from Professor
Flatscher, scientist of the Academy for
Soil Cultivation in Vienna. He has
estimated that the world's forests pro¬
duce about 1,600 million cubic metres
of timber a year whereas the volume
cut annually amounts to between 2,200
and 2,600 million cubic metres. This
indicates that the annual fellings are
about 50 per cent above the allowable
cut.
Any private individual who sanc¬
tioned such improvidence would be
held responsible for bad management
and would certainly be heavily penal¬
ized. But mankind as a whole, it
seems, can indulge in prodigal waste
of this kind without being in conflict
with any law.
The total forested area of the world
is estimated to be about 10,000 million
acres and these forests should be cap¬
able of providing reasonably adequate
supplies for a population larger than
now exists. But the provision of such
supplies will entail the treatment of all
productive forests as renewable crops,
the opening up of forests which are
not yet accessible and the cessation of
the widespread devastation of forests
which still continues.
Of the 4,000 million acres of the
earth's original forest area which man
has destroyed, 1,000 million might
well be replanted especially since
much of this land is to be found in
places where the population is in
greatest need of the products of the
forest.
The cost per day of the second
world war was a little over $500 million.
The cost of one day of this war would
reafforest at least 20 million acres,
and the cost of 50 days would be suffi¬
cient to reclothe the entire 1,000 million
devastated acres with proper tree
cover.
Of course, no one is so naive as to
believe we are on the verge of any
such undertaking. But we are in pos¬
session of scientific knowledge, indus¬
trial skill and technical equipment
which could be used to spread the
potential benefits of the forest to the
uttermost ends of the inhabited earth.

Vesuvius in the Bay of Naples, enabled air-photographer to

Vesuvius was less active until the great eruption of 1631. Since

THE MENACE
OF 'EXTINCT'
VOLCANOES
I have gradually become convinced of something that laymen and even professional
geologists and volcanologists usually Ignore and it fills me with dread the prospect,
some day soon, of unheard-of volcanic catastrophes. Geological evidence has finally
convinced me that humanity has so far been fantastically lucky, and the catastrophes
of Pompeii and St. Pierre de la Martinique are nothing to what awaits us. These were
small towns compared with the enormous modern cities threatened at closer or longer
range by a volcanic outburst Naples and Rome, Portland and Seattle, Mexico City,
Bandung, Sapporo, Oakland, Catania, Clermont-Ferrand... I Volcanoes regarded as totally
extinct near these cities are dead only to eyes that cannot or will not see. A volcano
may be less than a century dormant and people almost cease altogether to think of it
as such. But volcanoes are geologically live; time for them is counted not in years or
even in centuries, but in millennia and tens of millennia.
Centuries, hundreds of centuries might pass and Clermont-Ferrand, Rome or Seattle
not be wiped out. But the interval might be much less...

THE SALERNO SCIENCE SCHOOL
OF THE NINTH CENTURY
by Riccardo Luzzato
10
%I HEN the provinces of the
Western Roman Empire were invaded
by primitive warrior tribes in the fifth
century, the great wealth of scientific
knowledge created and accumulated by
the Romans, Greeks and the older
eastern civilizations seemed irretriev¬
ably lost to Europe. Yet, during the
troubled centuries of the early Middle
Ages there was established an interna¬
tional scientific organization which was
to flourish for more than 500 years in
the face of all the violent prejudice
then prevailing in the Christian world.
During the ninth century, in the
seaside town of Salerno, in southern
Italy, a school was founded which was
to renew and preserve medical know¬
ledge for the world and provide an
example of the practicality and impor¬
tance of intercultural co-operation.
Records are incomplete about the
early days of the Civitas Hippocratica,
as the school was called in honour of
the greatest physician of Ancient
Greece. Modern historians generally
agree however, in ascribing its founda¬
tions to four scholars: Master Adela,
an Arab, Master Helinus, a Jew, Master
Pontus, a Greek and Master Salernus,
an Italian. Each taught in his language,
which meant Latin for Salernus and
Hebrew for Helinus.
The international character of the
institution is illustrated by the fact that
the nationality of many of its famous
teachers was hardly known. At the
Civitas Hippocratica, they were just
teachers, and the thousands of stu¬
dents who came from Arabia, Africa,
Spain, Britain, Palestine, northern
France and other countries knew and
cared little about the origins of their
professors. This applies to Gabrio-
pontus who died about 1050. Some
historians think he was a Greek, others
that he was a Lombard, others again
that he was a Salernitan.
One of his best known successors,
Constantinus Africanus, was born in
Carthage and made long journeys to
Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia and India, to
bring the latest achievements of Eas¬
tern science to Salerno.
The passion for science at Salerno
was strong enough to overcome more
than one form of prejudice. A pro¬
minent figure of the early period was
the woman physician Trotula, about
whose personality little is known,
although she left a number of medical
treatises which were used as textbooks
up to the sixteenth century and were
first printed by Aldus in Venice in 1547.
Other women too were admitted to the
lectures and to study.
Doctor Trotula acquired such wide
fame, that she became popular in old
English literature under the name of
"Dame Trot" and became Madame
Trotte in the 13th century medical trou¬
vère Rutebceuf (Le Dex de I'Erberie).
Further evidence of the universality
of science, even in the so-called Dark
Ages, was the long-continued collabo¬
ration of Christians, Moslems and Jews,
during the whole of Europe's "crusad¬
ing periods". To the average European
of the Middle Ages, whoever did not
belong to the orthodox Christian
Church, whether he was a Jew, a
Moslem, a Hindu, a pagan or worst of
all a heretic was hardly considered as
a human being.
Written records of the Salerno school
show the influence of the great Arabian
schools of the Orient and Mohamme¬
dan Spain. The Persian physicians
Rhazes (865-925) and Avicenna (980-
1037); and the Spanish Arabs Aven-
zoar (1113-1162) and Averroes (1126-
1 198), as well as the great Maimonides,
a Spanish Jew (1135-1204), were inten¬
sively studied at Salerno. Two of the
most celebrated Jewish physicians, the
urologist Isaac Judaeus (9th or 10th
century) and the oculist Benvenutus
Grassus (born in Jerusalem in the 11th
or 12th century) had studied and taught
at the Salerno school.
Salerno re-awakened a scientific
spirit, independent of dogmatic doc¬
trines; revived ancient texts, and
inspired its students to a calm and
critical appraisal of facts. Thus,
Salerno paved the way for the great
achievements of the universities of the
Renaissance.
Its outstanding accomplishments and
its lasting influence were possible
because, right from the beginning, it
overcame the towering barriers of
religious and national prejudice and
aimed to make knowledge available to
the greatest possible number of people
of all lands of the then known world.

Ur-
Twenty centuries ago, Antiochus I, King of
Commagene raised a mighty monument to him¬
self and his gods atop Nemrud Dagh (Mount
Nimrod) in the Anti-Taurus Mountains of present-
day Turkey. Hewn from the mountain rock, the
sanctuary consists of three terraces levelled on
the summit and decorated with giant statues
of Antiochus and the deities worshipped by his
Greek and Persian ancestors. Above the ter¬
races rises a great tumulus of rock chippings
which archaeologists believe may hide the tomb
of Antiochus, but so far this rocky cairn has
defied exploration. The colossal statues guard¬
ing the secret of this Anatolian king still stand,
but most have been decapitated. Left, fallen
heads of deities litter the west terrace of
Nimrud Dagh. Though now shattered by earth¬
quakes, erosion and vandalism, the deities still
seem marvels of engineering skill. Upon their
platform, they rose as high as a five-storey
building. Above, heads of Herakles (on left) and
Zeus (right) are twice the height of a man.
Above left, bearded Herakles (foreground) and
handsome Apollo resemble giants buried to the
neck in the rocky soil.

The existence of a supra-national platform of discussion Is apt
to accustom the peoples gradually to the idea that national
Interests must be safeguarded by negotiation and not by brute
force... a world federation presupposes a new kind of loyalty

short at the national boundaries. To be truly effective, such
loyalty must embrace more than purely political issues. Under¬
standing among different cultural groups, mutual economic and

One of the most important factors that have contributed to the
birth of the typical culture of Brazil Is the fact that the Negro

an undesirable African who never should have come to Brazil

AiINTARCTICA is a true landmark in history as well as in
geography. It is as international now as science itself. The whole
continent is inhabited only by scientists who have come from 12 nations
with no purpose of conquest or possession. They share their data
and discoveries, their equipment and supplies as well as their hard¬
ships with men from other lands. The continent is a vast area of
nearly 6,000,000 square miles, approximately circular, and 3,000 miles
in diameter nearly twice ae large as Europe, almost as large as
South America. Over it all is the endless monotony of the age-old ice
sheet, in places 10,000 feet thick. Here six thousand scientists are
studying how the Antarctic influences world weather conditions, the
world water balance, glaciers, ocean currents, etc., and are making
measurements of the earth's magnetism, cosmic rays, the aurora and
other phenomena of the upper atmosphere and of the earth's interior.
The exploration and study of Antarctica is one of the major aspects
of history's greatest global operation in science the International
Geophysical Year (IGY) which began in 1957 and set out to observe
and measure features of the earth and its vicinity, heretofore beyond
man's reach. None of these problems can be investigated in the
laboratories or from observatories of a single country. The winds
on high, the rivers in the sea, the forces of gravity and magnetism,
the radiations that bombard the earth from outer space, know no¬
thing of national frontiers. If they are to be understood, it must be
by the joint action of many nations. For the first time in history,
this is now possible. It will change our concepts of the universe and
our understanding of the forces that play upon and within the earth.
A new age begins with the concerted action of many peoples and by
the carefully organized researches of many thousands of scientists
the world over. For the first time, the peoples of the earth have joined
to study their common and fundamental scientific problems together.

THE MYSTERIOUS
HIEROGLYPHS
OF EASTER ISLAND
by Alfred Metraux
I,VER since a Dutch vessel
chanced across it two centuries ago,
Easter Island, no more than a speck
in the vastness of the South Pacific,
has intrigued the world with myster¬
ies which have so far been only par¬
tially and tentatively explained.
For long the principal mystery of
Easter Island lay in the colossal sta¬
tues which still dot the bare slopes
of the Rano-raraku volcano and which
once stood in far greater numbers like
sentinels over the mausoleums along
the seashore.
In my opinion the greatest "mystery"
of Easter Island is not to be found in
the many colossal statues erected
there. There is no doubt that the
ancestors of the present Polynesian
inhabitants hewed out these statues
and dragged them to their present
sites, abandoning the workshops where
they carved them perhaps only three
or four centuries ago.
However, no one has yet been able
to give a satisfactory explanation for
what appears to be a form of writing
developed on the island.
This writing first came to light about
1860 when the people of the island,
newly converted to Christianity, sent
the Bishop of Tahiti, a Monsignor
Jaussen, a long cord braided from
their own hair, wound around an old
piece of wood. Looking casually at
the improvised spool, the Bishop was
surprised to see that it was covered
ALFRED METRAUX, noted anthropologist and
writer, won international fame for his work
on Easter Island and amongst the Indians of
South America, and his efforts on behalf of
racial equality. He died In 1963.
with small figures, all of the same
height and carefully arranged In
straight lines. These reminded him of
Egyptian hieroglyphics, and he wrote
to the missionaries on Easter Island
asking them to look for other tablets
and to try to decipher them.
Seeing how interested he was in this
object, one of the islanders brought
in a large tablet, perfectly preserved.
Since then, other tablets have been
found on the island and now total 24,
including one large wooden rod cover¬
ed with hundreds of symbols.
At the time when. the first tablets
were discovered, it' would probably
have been possible to obtain the key
to the mystery from the surviving
members of the priestly caste. The
old civilization of Easter Island had
only recently collapsed but there were
still a few "wise men" alive who could
have explained the meaning of the
strange symbols on the tablets had
they been questioned.
Unfortunately, the missionaries were
not skilful Investigators. They queried
the islanders who, at the sight of the
tablets, began to intone chants, instead
of "reading" them. The missionaries
treated them as frauds and lost interest
in the matter.
Mgr. Jaussen, however, was more
persevering. In Tahiti, he found an
Easter Islander named Metoro, who
had learnt the mysteries of the tablets
under a famous master. The Bishop
handed him a tablet and asked him to
"read" it. Metoro turned it this way
and that and suddenly began to chant.
He "read" the tablet from right to
left, without bothering io turn it round,
although in each line the signs are
upside down in relation to that preced¬
ing or following.
Jaussen took down the text as Me¬
toro recited it, and his manuscript
was recently published. If each phrase
is compared with the corresponding
symbols, it appears that what Jaussen
had taken to be a connected text is
simply a disjointed succession of brief
descriptions of the symbols viewed by
his interpreter, and a series of isolated
words or phrases suggested by those
symbols. There is no logical develop¬
ment or general sense in the chant or
recital. Mgr. Jaussen ended by losing
heart himself and abandoned his efforts
to get to the bottom of the mystery.
Other attempts were made to extract
from the ¡slanders information which
might have made it possible to de¬
cipher the symbols. On a visit to East¬
er Island in 1886, an American paymas¬
ter, Mr. W. Thomson, was taken to the
house of an old man called Ure-Vaeiko,
who, in his youth, had attended the
school of the Tangata rongo-rongo,
(singers or bards) and learned to read
the tablets.
Ure-Vaeiko consented to "read"
photographs of the tablets, if not the
tablets themselves. He recited their
contents from end to end without a
moment's hesitation. It was noticed,
however, that he was paying no atten¬
tion to the number of symbols in each
line and, worse still, did not notice
that the photographs had been sur¬
reptitiously changed. He went happily
on reciting hymns and legends until
he was accused of being a fraud.
Responsibility for these lost oppor¬
tunities lies, not with the islanders,
who appear to have acted in good
faith, but with the early investigators,
who were incapable of imagining a
system of writing different from their
own and were bent at all costs on
having the tablets "read".
During my stay on Easter Island
in 1934-35, I tried to discover, in the
memories of my informants, some indi¬
cation, however vague or apparently
insignificant, which might have put me
onto the right track; but it was all
useless. The inhabitants had, it is
true, assured me that the tablets were
similar to the "cat's cradle" patterns,
each suggesting a chant to the viewer.
I concluded that the tablets were
The strange "hieroglyphs" discovered
on Easter Island are mostly engraved
on wooden tablets or othei wooden
objects, like this fish. They depict
stylized human forms, birds, fish, plants,
shellfish and ceremonial objects, or
sometimes geometrical designs. Easter
Islanders can no longer read this
ancient script or system of notation,
and scientists have been unable to
decipher it until now.

PIERRE LOTI AT
EASTER ISLAND
On January 3, 1872, the French frigate "Flore"
dropped anchor in Cook's Bay at Easter Island.
On board was a 22-year old midshipman, Julien
Viaud, who was later to become a famous
novelist under the pseudonym Pierre Loti. The
"Flore" had stopped at Easter Island to bring
back to France the head of one of the huge sta¬
tues, carved from soft volcanic stone, for which the
island is famous (the head is now in the Musée
de l'Homme in Paris). A skilled artist, Loti was
assigned to make a series of drawings of the
statues, the ¡slanders, their dwellings and their
tools and artifacts. He also did a number of
drawings of the islanders' tattoo patterns. Loti
drew two types of statues found on Easter Island:
the now familiar bust type standing on the slopes
of the crater of the volcano, Rano-raraku; and
a long-bodied type which formerly surmounted the
funerary cairns (ahus) that fringe the coast in
an almost continuous procession. It was believed
that, as a result of fierce inter-tribal wars, all
the "ahu" statues were toppled over after 1838.
This drawing by Loti, under which he wrote,
"Easter Island, 7 January 1872, about 5 a.m.;
inhabitants watching me arrive," shows that at
least five of the statues were still undamaged
in 1872. The sketch also shows inhabitants with
Easter Island tattooing, a Janus-headed dance
paddle or club, and various hair styles: tuft or
pompom arrangement and diadem of rooster
feathers. Human skulls (foreground) were then
found everywhere on the island. Loti also drew a
group of five statues atop a burial platform made
up of four superimposed terraces; each statue
wore a cylindrical head-dress of volcanic tufa.

mnemonic pictographs used in reciting
the genealogies and sacred hymns
which form a large part of the Poly¬
nesian liturgy. I was all the more
inclined to this interpretation because,
in the Marquesas, which are probably
the original home of the Easter Island¬
ers, the singers or bards associate
their liturgical poems with small fibre
pouches from which hang thin knotted
cords. It was thus possible that each
symbol on the tablets represented a
sentence, a line or even a stanza.
This, then, was the hypothesis I had
arrived at and which was accepted
by other anthropologists. But I am less
sure now that my interpretation is
right since receiving a letter from a
German anthropologist, Dr. T.S. Bar-
thel, suggesting that the system used
by the Easter Islanders was far more
complicated than mere picture-writing,
and could be a real script, part ideo¬
graphic part phonetic, using the rebus
somewhat in the fashion of the Mexi¬
can and Mayan scripts. According to
this interpretation, the script consisted
of symbols indicating the general mean¬
ing of a sentence by the use of a num¬
ber of key words.
A Hungarian linguist, G. de Hevesy,
has pointed out similarities between
some of the Easter Island symbols and
the undeciphered script of the Mo-
henjo-Daro and Harappa civilizations
which existed in the Indus Valley some
six thousand years ago.
The Austrian scholar, Professor
R. Heine-Geldern, considers it doubt¬
ful that a direct link exists between
these two scripts since there are far
more symbols that are different than
symbols that are the same. His ar¬
chaeological research led him to be¬
lieve that the Polynesian civilizations
originated in China, and it was there
that he sought the origins of their
system of writing.
Heine-Geldern compared the sym¬
bols of Mohenjo-Daro and Easter Island
with those of the earliest Chinese
writing found on oracle bones and
shells dating back to the second millen¬
nium B.C. He found that some of the
symbols were common to all three
scripts and concluded that the writing
of Easter Island had been transported
to the Pacific by a people from
southern China possessing a system
of writing that may have originated
in central Asia or Iran.
Heine-Geldern also compared the
Easter Island writing with the picto¬
graphs still used among the Cuna In
dians in Panama. The famous pre-
historian. Dr. G. von Koenigswald, has
pointed out similarities between the
Easter Islands symbols and certain
drawings on fabrics in Indonesia.
I think it is fairly easy to discover
curious similarities between scripts of
the pictographic type. The very fact
that it is so easy should put us on our
guard. Whatever the true nature of
the symbols on Easter Island's tablets,
I believe that the scribes who made
them sought their models in the Is¬
land's natural and cultural environment.
To me, all the indications seem to
be that the writing of Easter Island
was invented on that remote little
island itself, probably on the basis of
some mnemonic system brought by
the ancestors of the Easter Islanders
from their original home.
If it is ultimately proved that these
symbols are indeed hieroglyphics which
can be "read", then the Easter Island¬
ers, who have already amazed the
world by the quality of their art and
the impressive proportions of their
monuments, could claim the additional
honour of having by a stroke of genius
taken a decisive step in the develop¬
ment of civilization.

THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS
LIVING LABORATORY
OF EVOLUTION
by Jean Dorst
|N 1837, after a five-year
voyage aboard the Beagle in the
waters of South America, the Pacific
Islands and Australia, Charles Darwin
wrote in his journal : "In July I opened
my first notebook on transmutation of
species. Had been greatly struck
from about month of previous March
on character of South American fossils
and species of Galapagos Archipelago.
These facts origin (especially latter) of
all my views."
Thus, the Galapagos Archipelago,
lying some 600 miles out in the Pacific
west of the coast of Ecuador, to which
it belongs, directly inspired the famous
British naturalist
Superficially, this tiny archipelago
appears to have nothing of particular
interest to the scientist. A few dots

logical laboratory of the National Museum
of Natural History in Paris.
less than 3,000 square miles), the
13 islands of the Galapagos group
include five which are fairly large (the
largest is Albemarle Island, 60 miles
in length), numerous islets and rocks.
Of volcanic origin, they are the peaks
of a range of submarine volcanoes
thrust up from the sea by successive
eruptions.
Though close to the equator, the
Galapagos Islands are washed by fairly
cool seas from the famous Humboldt
Current which brings cold water from
the Antarctic along the coasts of Chile
and Peru, then turns west at the equa¬
tor and runs towards the Galapagos
Islands, after which it loses itself in
the ocean depths.
The fauna living in the archipelago
is limited to very few species. As
these species were isolated by large .
stretches of ocean from the dawn of
history, they form a world apart which
has followed its own evolutionary
laws shut off from the rest of our
planet. Plants and animals arrived
there from the American continent as
best they could, swimming, flying or
borne by the winds on natural rafts
composed of a tangle of tree trunks
and deadwood like those often carried
along by many big tropical rivers.
The ocean crossing must have been
a difficult enterprise and, in fact, only
a limited number of creatures made
the voyage safely. This explains the
paucity of the Galapagos fauna and
flora, especially as compared with the
luxuriance of tropical America.
It may thus seem surprising that
.biologists regard these apparently
barren islands as a scientific wonder¬
land. But the scientists are right, for
the Galapagos Islands are no less than
a natural laboratory in which the pro¬
cess of evolution can be clearly
observed. As the botanist, J.T. Howell,
so rightly said they are the workroom
and show-window of Evolution.
Being so remote, the Galapagos
Elephants' feet turned into waste-paper baskets for sale to

trunks off in frantic efforts to escape the poacher's wire snare.
POACHING: THE SHOCKING
SLAUGHTER OF AFRICA'S WILD LIFE
Poaching today in Africa is a large-scale illegal trade in slaughtered
wild animals. It is by no means confined to killing for meat; all
too often it takes the horrible and wasteful form of merely taking
the valuable trophies such as rhino horn, wildebeest tails or elephant
ivory, and leaving the slaughtered carcasses to rot. The poacher's
methods are not only wasteful, 1>ut extremely cruel. Gangs of
bowmen with poisoned arrows wait near a waterhole or at a gap
in a prepared barrier, and shoot large numbers of animals which
then die an agonizing death. Pitfalls are worse. The large number
of animals that fall into them suffer a much more lingering death.
Wire snares are the worst of all. Animals die a slow and horrible
death, sometimes beset by vultures and hyenas. The abolition of
this shocking trade is becoming just as compelling an aim in the
Africa of the present as was the abolition of the slave trade in
the Africa of a century ago. Like the slave trade, it is profitable,
highly organized, extremely cruel and quite ruthless.

The spectacle of
iguanas basking on
the rocks of the
Galapagos is like a
flashback to the earth's
reptile age. After
visiting the islands in
1841, Herman Melville,
author of "Moby Dick"
wrote: "...Little but
reptile life is found
here; tortoises, lizards,
immense spiders,
snakes, and that
strangest anomaly of
outlandish nature,
the iguana."

Islands have served as a refuge for
animals of an archaic type and for a
biological environment which has van¬
ished everywhere else in the world.
As mammals could not reach these
islands, the reptiles developed, un¬
hindered by natural selection or pre¬
datory animals.
The scene that unfolds before one's
eyes on setting foot on these shores
recalls the prehistoric era of the age
of the reptiles. Along the beaches
live marine iguanas 3 \ feet long, the
only marine saurians still in existence.
They feed on seaweed, grazing at low
tide and bask in the sun in colonies
sometimes running into hundreds.
In the interior, land ¡guanas of a
different type live amongst the cactus
along with the giant tortoises which
are such a characteristic sight that
their Spanish name, "Galapagos", was
applied to the islands. These giants,
whose shells alone measure 3 i feet,
are now found only in the Galapagos
Islands and the Seychelles, though
fossilized remains extend over a vast
area covering North America and
Europe.
The remoteness of the archipelago
resulted in a simplification of the fauna
thus making it easier to follow the
laws of evolution here than anywhere
else in the world. Elsewhere the com¬
plexities of nature and the diversity of
forms have made it virtually impossible
to trace the lineage of many species.
The Galapagos Islands thus stand
out as Nature's great experimental
laboratory.
This is particularly true of the famous
Darwin finches, or Geospizidae, spar¬
rows indigenous to the Galapagos
Islands. The Islands' 14 species are
all derived from a common ancestor,
which obviously arrived there at a time
when there were no other birds. The
Darwin finches strikingly summarize
the whole process of the evolution of
sparrows.
Owing to the paradoxical conditions
of the natural environment mainly
due to the presence of cold currents
at the equator alongside masses of
warm water fauna of very diverse ori¬
gins have crossbred on these islands.
Here penguins, usually associated
with the Antarctic, rub shoulders with
frigate and tropic birds found near
warm tropical waters. The combined
presence of creatures having such
widely different origins and ecological
preferences is an important factor In
the evolution now taking place. These
peculiar circumstances enable us to
study at first hand the adaptation of
animals to their environment.
Yet the situation of the fauna and
flora is so precarious that this unique
biological complex is threatened with
extinction. Up till the sixteenth cen¬
tury the islands remained untouched
by man. Then came successive waves
of pirates, buccaneers and settlers
mostly mutineers or ex-prisoners.
F,ORTUNATELY the present
population is made up of law-abiding
and friendly settlers, but like many
people elsewhere they know little about
nature conservation. Furthermore, they
have introduced animals previously
unknown to the islands, most of which
are now overrun with goats, pigs, dogs
and cattle bred from domestic animals
turned wild, not to mention the rats
and mice introduced accidentally. So
in addition to the direct depredations
of man, the natural fauna has had to
face the vigorous competition of ani¬
mals better equipped for the struggle
for life than reptiles.
Everywhere in the islands the
reptiles have diminished in number
especially the tortoises. In former
times they were massacred for their
fat; now their eggs and young are
devoured by the dogs and pigs. Some
species are already extinct, while
others are in a precarious situation.
The fauna as a whole is seriously
threatened. We are in danger1 of
seeing a priceless natural heritage
disappear before our very eyes.
As early as 1934 this state of affairs
alarmed the Ecuadorian Government,
which passed laws to protect the
Galapagos fauna and flora and setting
aside most of the islands as national
parks. Unfortunately these regulations
were hardly applied. After the Sec¬
ond World War, Ecuador turned to
Unesco and the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature and
asked them to send a mission to study
the islands, and to suggest ways to
preserve the Galapagos fauna and
flora.
In 1959, Unesco founded the Charles
Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos
Islands with headquarters in Brussels,
and in 1960 began construction of a
biological station on Indefatigable
Island (Santa Cruz), both in co-opera¬
tion with the Government of Ecuador.
New legislation introduced by
Ecuador has now proved effective.
Large areas have been decreed natural
reserves, notably Narborough Island
(Fernandina), which has retained it ori¬
ginal appearance, and the western part
of Indefatigable Island (Santa Cruz),
where tortoises are still fairly numer¬
ous. The Foundation will continue to
suggest to the Ecuadorian authorities
measures aimed at protecting and
conserving a natural complex found
nowhere else in the world and is also
carrying out extensive research in
zoology, botany, soil biology and
marine life.
The combined efforts of scientists
from all over the world are In this
way making up in some measure for
the depredations committed by other
men. The Foundation stands as a
monument to Charles Darwin, whose
evolutionary theories were conceived -4 n

THE HERITAGE
OF
H.M.S. BOUNTY
by Harry L. Shapiro
The rugged shoreline of Bounty Bay on Pitcairn Island. Here nine of
the mutineers of the "Bounty", led by Fletcher Christian, and 18 Tahitian
men and women found refuge and established a colony which still
stands as a remarkable example of racial harmony.
P,ERHAPS the most widely
known of all cases of race mixture is
the small group of Polynesian-English
origin that lives on Pitcairn Island, in
the South Pacific. Here, on a tiny
volcanic island only about two miles
long and about half as wide were
resolved the train of events that the
mutiny on the Bounty set in action.
This episode, famous in British nav¬
al annals, occurred in the year 1789
shortly after "H.M.S. Bounty" had de¬
parted from Tahiti where she had been
dispatched under the command of
Lt. William Bligh to collect bread fruit
plants.
After six successful months in Tahiti,
with the ship's hold full of potted trees,
the return trip was interrupted by the
mutiny of twenty-five of the crew of
forty-four. The mutineers were led by
Fletcher Christian, one of Bligh's
officers.
The mutineers seized the ship, put
Bligh and those faithful to him adrift
in a small open boat and reset the
Bounty's course for Tubuai, an island
300 miles south of Tahiti. Here an
abortive attempt was made to estab¬
lish a settlement, which failed because
of the hostility of the islanders.
Returning to Tahiti, the mutineers
split into two groups: one, consisting
of sixteen men, remained in Tahiti; the
other nine, headed by Christian, to¬
gether with twelve Tahitian women and
six Tahitian men. set sail from Tahiti
in September 1789 to find an unknown
island where they could hide.
For 19 years, until 1808, they were
virtually lost to the world. In the latter
year, their retreat on Pitcairn, some

of die Department of Anthropology at the
American Museum of National History, New
York, and professor of anthropology at
Columbia University.
2,500 miles south-east of Tahiti, was
discovered by Captain Meyhew Folger.
During this interval much had hap¬
pened on the island. All the Tahitian
men and all but one of the Englishmen
had died most of them violently and
after only a short sojourn in their new
home. In addition, Folger found eight
or nine surviving Tahitian women and
twenty-five children, offspring of six
of the Englishmen and their Poly¬
nesian wives. None of the Tahitian
men had left issue.
From this handful of children, half
Polynesian half English, the little colony
increased until fifty years later there
were almost 200 inhabitants on the
island. Fear of over-population and
the recurrence of water shortages in¬
duced them to request of the British
Government the use of Norfolk Island,
some 4,000 miles to the west, as a
new home. This considerably larger
island was uninhabited.
In 1856, the entire colony moved
there, but subsequently several fami¬
lies returned to their beloved Pitcairn.
In 1864, there were 45 descendants of
the mutineers living on Pitcairn, the re¬
mainder having continued on Norfolk.
At present, there are on both islands
about 1,000 descendants of the original
colony, not counting those who have
married out of the community or settled
elsewhere.
As an example of race mixture the
Pitcairn Islanders are far from typical.
But it is the very singularity of the
colony that is full of meaning in inter¬
preting race mixture as we commonly
see it. Simply as a cross between
Polynesians and English they can be
matched in many parts of Polynesia
where the same kind of mingling has
occurred, often with notable results, as
in New Zealand.
But unlike all other mixtures of this
kind in Oceania, and indeed unlike
virtually all race mixture wherever it
occurs (1), the Pitcairn Islanders have
lived and developed their common life
completely separated from the socie¬
ties from which they were originally
derived.
The entire community was of the
same mixed origin, was free of any
social structuring imposed upon them
by a larger society and escaped the
influences that prejudice subtly works
upon its object. This, then, is a
community where social prejudice, at
least, is not a factor to be considered
and where we can study the con¬
sequences of race mixture divorced
from the concomitant effects that
being a part of a larger group might
impose.
For the first eighteen years of its
existence, the Pitcairn colony remain¬
ed unvisited by any ship. The child¬
ren growing up in the first genera¬
tion of the community had never seen
anyone not a member of their little
family, for the early colony lived
as one extended family with John
Adams, the surviving mutineer, as
their pater familias.
Even after 1808 when their existence
became known, callers were rare and
their visits very brief. Not until the
1820s did ships begin to call at Pit¬
cairn to obtain water and fresh foods.
As American whaling became in¬
creasingly active in the Pacific these
visits increased in number, reaching
their highest frequency in the 1840s.
With the decline of whaling, Pit¬
cairn once more reverted to its
former loneliness. These contacts,
although important in bringing to the
islanders the goods of the outside
world for which they had acquired

a taste, were brief and had little or
no influence on the social structure
of the colony.
To anyone visiting the island, it is
evident that here is a well-organized
settlement, conducting its own affairs
successfully under a system devised
by the islanders themselves. There
is no trace of a people conscious of
inferiority.
Remarkable in so small a commun¬
ity, especially one cut off from the
developments of the outside world,
are some of the social institutions
which were established on Pitcairn
and maintained there ever since.
A democratic rule developed early
with all men and women enjoying
equal political rights, long before poli¬
tical rights were granted women in the
Western World and indeed before they
were even seriously discussed there.
Education was from the first recog¬
nized as a necessity and all children
were required to attend school until
their sixteenth year. The various fami¬
lies on the island were taxed for the
maintenance of the school. Teachers
were selected from the students and
supported by the revenue levied on
the people. Here, too, the Pitcairn
Islanders were in advance of educa¬
tional developments in greater cen¬
tres of civilization.
IHE culture that emerged
on Pitcairn also reflected the mixed
origin of the colony and in a rather
striking way illustrates the decisive
rôles that sex and environment may
play in creating a new society. The
cultural resources available to the new
colony were, of course,. English and
Tahitian. But it is obvious on re¬
flection that not all the content of
either of these cultures could or
would be drawn upon since one cul¬
ture, the English, was accessible only
through men who were sailors by
occupation, and the other,, the Tahi¬
tian, was represented by women who
were familiar with the crafts and
skills traditionally exercised in Tahiti
by their sex.
In addition to this, the colony on
Pitcairn faced an environment unlike
the seats of either people, and in
transplanting their traditional ways
both the Tahitian women and the
English sailors found themselves with¬
out the usual technical equipment need¬
ed to practice whatever skills and
arts they knew. Even such a basic
and necessary object as a nail was
not available, not to mention a var¬
iety of common tools that could not
be fashioned on Pitcairn.
Thus, we find tata cloth universal¬
ly used by the colony in its early
days. The making of this bark cloth
is traditionally a woman's job in Tahiti
and could be carried to Pitcairn intact.
Similarly, cooking being a woman's
concern, the Tahitian technique of an
underground oven was standard on
Pitcairn.
House building, on the contrary,
was the result of a complex of in¬
fluences. The Tahitian style of house
would have been unsuitable in the
colder climate of Pitcairn, but in any
event it probably could not have been
built by the women who in Tahiti
leave the framing of a house to the
men. The Englishmen, probably only
as adept in carpentry as sailors of
those days might be expected to be,
were handicapped by the lack of
essential building materials and ham¬
pered by the lack of tools.
We find them as a consequence
building houses ingeniously put
together, the frame mortised, the
walls constructed of roughly hewn
planks fitted into slotted uprights,
the interiors provided with bunks
as in a ship's cabin. The roof,
however, was thatched in the Tahi¬
tian manner since roof thatching is
prepared in Tahiti by the women and
this was a contribution the Tahitian
women on Pitcairn could make to this
novel house.
One of the common allegations
made about race mixture is that it
produces inferior human beings. This
belief is stated in various ways that
all come to the same thing: mixed
bloods combine the worst features
of both parental groups, they are
inferior to both stocks, or, at best,
they are intermediate and therefore a
debasement of the superior group.
In the mid-1 9th century the typical
reaction was delight in finding so
moral, upright and virtuous a colony
sprung from mutineers, from violence
and from murder. Nowadays, being
less concerned with religious matters,
with on the whole rather different
values, the present visitor is less
impressed by these qualities and is
likely to prize other aspects of their
character.
For my part I can report that,
allowing for their isolation and for a
consequent lack of sophistication, I
found the Pitcairn Islanders an
intelligent and attractive people. And
I was struck by the number of men
and women of impressive character,
possessed of the qualities that make
for leadership.
Although biologically rather more of
what might be called objective infor¬
mation is accessible, still it can only
be used for comparative purposes
with caution. Even such standard
criteria as physical vigour, longevity
or health cannot be properly used for
such purposes without reference to
diet, climate and various other environ¬
mental conditions.
Both on Norfolk and Pitcairn Islands
the physical condition of the islanders
was excellent. In spite of the
inbreeding, which has especially
characterized Pitcairn, I found no
physical deformities or obvious signs
of degeneration.
On Pitcairn with a population of
200 (1936) there were no cases of
serious mental deficiency. This is
an excellent record compared with
the frequency of such cases in Europe
and the United States, especially in
remote, inbred villages.
In view of the fact that neither on
Pitcairn nor Norfolk is there any
resident medical service or even
trained nursing aid, the longevity of
the population is impressive.
There have been some claims that
children of race mixtures are smaller
and weaker than their parents. The
Pitcairn and Norfolk evidence is quite
the contrary. Indeed, there is evi¬
dence here of hybrid vigour compar¬
able to the vigour that can be
demonstrated experimentally in a
large number of animal and plant
crosses and which is real enough
to be commercially valuable to seed
companies.
For example, if we take size as a
measure of heightened physiological
vigour as is done for maize or
crossbred domestic animals, we find
that the average stature of the
parental groups is 171.4 centimetres
for Tahitian males and 170.6 centi
metres for the mutineers (based on
British Admiralty records). The modern
Englishman averages around 172 cms.
The first generation descendants,
averaged 177.8 centimetres (minimum
5 feet 9 1/2 inches, maximum 6 feet 1/4
inch). This represents an average
increase of over two inches, with the
shortest male exceeding the average
of his parental groups by a consid¬
erable margin. Although this striking
increase has not been fully main¬
tained in the present generation, it is
still almost an inch above the parental
average.
As far as the evidence goes, then,
the Pitcairn experiment lends no
support for the thesis that race mixture
merely leads to degeneration or at
best produces a breed inferior to the
superior parental race. In fact, we
see in this colony some support for
heightened vigour, for an extended fl-f
variation and for a successful issue ¿ \
of the mingling of two diverse strains.

THE SPREAD OF
BUDDHIST CULTURE
by Anil de Silva
IN India, during the third
century B.C. the Emperor Asoka was
converted to Buddhism after a bloody
war against the neighbouring Kalinga
Kingdom. He then issued his famous
edict which he caused to be carved
on rock and stone throughout his
kingdom:
"One hundred and fifty thousand
people were deported, one hundred
thousand people were killed, many
times this number perished... Remorse
fills the King friend of the Gods since
he has conquered Kalinga. The con¬
quest of an independent country
means murder, death or captivity for
men. All are victims of violence and
death and separation from those who
are dear to them. These thoughts
weigh heavily on the King friend of
the Gods...
"Even if the number of victims in the
' conquest of Kalinga were a hundred
thousand times smaller, the thought
of this would afflict the King friend
of the Gods. Even if they were in the
wrong the King friend of the Gods
believes we should have been as
patient as possible. The victory that
is the best of all is the Victory of the
Good Law (Buddhism). This text of
the Law is engraved for my sons and
grandchildren so that they will not
dream of new victories. Let them
seek real victories through the exer¬
cise of patience..."
The world in which Buddhism was
born 2,500 years ago was a world
of vast movements of men and ideas,
much vaster than we generally imag¬
ine. In this world India was geogra¬
phically, the crossroads between
Western and Far Eastern civilizations.
Both the great land routes entered

her northern passes from the West
through Persia and from the East
through China and Central Asia, over
the old silk caravan route.
On the maritime routes, Persian,
Greek, Roman and Alexandrian ships
scoured the ports of Gujerath and
Konkan on the west coast, and Coim-
batore, Andhra, Bengal and Ceylon in
the south. India was also the port
of call for Far Eastern ships going
westwards, and her own ships sailed
out in all directions.
Contacts between the Western
world and India were continuous.
The Persian Emperor Darius left his
great terraced palace at Persepolis to
lead an expedition into the Punjab and
the Indus valley a few years before
the death of Buddha in the 5th
century B.C.
Alexander's expedition in the fourth
century B.C., bringing with it topo¬
graphers and scientists, helped to
strengthen the land route kept up by
the couriers of the Persian monarchs.
Alexander built a port and a fleet on
the Indus and his captain, Nearque,
sailed down the Indus, forging a mari¬
time route between the Indus and the
Tigris. Alexander returned through
Afghanistan with elephants and Indian
soldiers in his army.
The whole of north-west India,
Afghanistan, Gandhara (Afghanistan
and Pakistan territory) and the
Punjab remained for centuries under
a succession of Greek princes, one of
whom, Milanda (Menander), became a
Buddhist. These Greek kingdoms
favoured the penetration of Greek,
Hellenistic and Roman culture. Greeks
intermarried with Indians and these
colonies formed centres of a new
Greco-Roman Buddhist culture. The
new culture developed rapidly under
the Kushana Empire which succeeded
the Greeks in the 1st century A.D.

invaded India from China and Central
Asia and whose emperors were con¬
verted to Buddhism).
More important than wars and
conquests was the long period of
friendship between Alexander's suc¬
cessors, the Seleucid kings in Persia
and the Mauryan kings in north India,
whose palace was modelled on that
of Darius at Persepolis, Persia. Am¬
bassadors were exchanged and for¬
eign merchants thronged the capital
Pataliputra (today Patna, capital of
Bihar province, north-east India). The
Emperor Asoka married a Greek princ¬
ess and sent his missionaries both
to the East and the West. His emis¬
saries to the West, carrying the
message of Buddha, reached Persia,
Egypt, Macedonia, Cyrenaica and
north-west Greece.
The Roman historian Pliny tells us
that Rome bought 50 million sesterces
worth of merchandise from India every
year: cotton from Malwa, lacquer
and nard from Pataliputra, indigo,
spices and precious stones from Kon-
kan, jades, ivories, silk and elephants
which the Romans used in large
numbers for their army and circus.
Roman coins of gold have been found
in the north-west and along the coast
of south India at Cannanore, Coim-
batore and Mahabalipurum with effi¬
gies of Augustus, Caracalla, Claudius,
Theodore and Constantine. A Roman-
Asian artist named Titus painted Bud¬
dhist frescoes at Miran in Central
Asia. Alexandrine merchants aided
Buddhist convents at Nasik and Junnar
near Bombay.
History gives us only a glimpse of
the vast movement of men at this
time: recruits in various armies
(Indian archers excelled in the Persian
army); craftsmen, metal workers, ivory
carvers (Indian ivories have been
found in Pompeii); weavers, jewellers,
sculptors and ceramists were sought
after at any price and protected by
merchants and princes.

ENTRAL Asia had two
routes through the desert: a northern
one and a southern one. They met at
Tun Huang In north-west China. These
were the principle arteries of Buddhist
expansion in Central Asia and China
and all became powerful centres of
Buddhist culture. Thousands of grottos
were excavated and open-air construc¬
tions were built. At Kizil alone thou¬
sands of grottos were cut out, painted
and carved by artisans from the Middle
East, India and China.
Hsuan Tsang, the famous Chinese
scholar who made his pilgrimage to
India by the northern route in the
7th century A.D., has left an unfor¬
gettable account of his journey through
burning deserts and snow-clad passes.
Historians also speak of the charm
of the women of Kutsha and record
that musicians and dancers from
Kutsha were seen at the Imperial
The sanctuaries in the Horyuji monastery at Nara, near Kyoto, are renowned as

Chinese festivals, dressed in crimson
silk turbans. The titles of their songs
have been preserved: "The Meeting
of the Seventh Evening," "The Woman
of Jade Takes Round the Cup," and
"The Battle of Flowers."
The frescoes of Kutsha, Kizil and
Kumtura show us the splendid caval¬
iers those who, Hsuan Tsang tells
us, escorted him on his way, for many
of these paintings were made by
contemporaries of Hsuan Tsang.
They show cavaliers wearing long
boots, riding coats of silk falling to
the knees and taken in at the waist
with metal belts. Their tunics of blue,
grey, white and olive green were
embroidered with pearls, lined and
bordered with fur. Their reddish hair
was caught up with ribbons at the
neck. They must have formed a glor¬
ious sight with their coloured and
gilded banners and standards, sculp¬
tured and painted with heraldic ani¬
mals like the tiger and the dragon.
Hsuan Tsang returned to China laden
with manuscripts and images of the
Buddha.
Bamiyan in Afghanistan was the
halting place for caravans either going
to or coming from the difficult passes
of the Hindu Kush which barred the
way into India. Into the façade of
the great cliff of Bamiyan. cave
sanctuaries with colossal Buddhas
were carved and painted, two of these
images reaching 173. and 120 feet in
height. Merchants paid craftsmen
and artists to paint and carve statues
as thank-offerings for a safe journey.
Tun Huang at the other end of the
route was developed with the help
of merchants and royal benefactors,
for the Wei, T'ang and Sung dynasties
in China all contributed to the creation
of one of the most extraordinary
monuments of Buddhist culture.
Among the hundreds of cave tem¬
ples at Tun Huang, the Cave of the
Thousand Buddhas, sealed up for
centuries, housed priceless treasures
of manuscripts and paintings on silk.
The first mention of Buddhism In
China is in 65 A.D. when the Han
prince, Tch'ou protected a small Bud¬
dhist community at Lo-yang. The
translation of Buddhist texts from
Sanskrit and Pali into Chinese was
officially encouraged by the Kushna
Empire in India (30-224 A.D.). Chi¬
nese travellers, merchants. Imperial
envoys and pilgrims came to India by
sea. In fact it is to Chinese historians
that we owe the only written accounts

of these early kingdoms in south-east
Asia.
The spread of Buddhism throughout
Asia came in several waves emanating
from India from the first century A.D.
Bronze statues of the time have been
unearthed from the jungles of Annam,
Borneo and Celebes. Buddhist cul¬
ture apparently superimposed itself
on the whole of south-east Asia.
However each region retained much of
its own personality and character.
In the 8th century A.D. Buddhist
art began to mature and flower in
these countries, gaining in movement
and vigour when local tradition domin¬
ated. We see this clearly at Boro¬
budur (Java) in whose 1,400 panels
and 504 statues of the Buddha the
Javanese pattern of composition, har¬
mony and repose are blended with the
Indian style of art. Later Javanese
art threw off this influence and assert¬
ed its own national characteristics.
Eventually there were large mona¬
steries and universities in all the
Buddhist countries of south-east Asia,
Japan and Korea. Pilgrims in their
thousands from all over Asia thronged
the great Buddhist universities of
Takila 'in Pakistan and Nalanda in
India. Hostels were built by the kings
of Ceylon and Java to house the
students and pilgrims from their coun¬
tries at Nalanda and at Bodh Gaya in
the Indian state of Bihar, where
Buddha attained enlightenment under
the Bodhi tree.
Many of the ships leaving Bengal
and the southern India ports carried
pilgrims and missionaries and, in addi¬
tion to the spices, precious stones,
muslins and silks in their holds, they
bore statues of the Buddha made in
the busy centres of Mathura and
Nalanda.
T,HE coming of Buddhism,
coinciding as it did with increased
trade and intercourse between Asian
countries, resulted in a period of
intense intellectual life. The message
of the brotherhood of men "No one
is a Brahmin or an outcast by birth,
but one becomes a Brahmin or an
outcast by one's actions" (Vasala
Sutra) was like rain falling on parched
earth. It stimulated a resurgence of
popular feeling just as Christ's mess¬
age did in Rome in early Christian
times.
The richly human content of the
Buddhist message was the spiritual
basis of an art which overrode the
frontiers of artistic expression, revital¬
ized local traditions, making them
truly Buddhist and at the same time
freed expressions of national character.
It was a message of hope. It was a
message of peace. And these two
important factors helped the develop¬
ment and maturity of a noble art that
has enriched the artistic traditions of
the world.

THE CHALLENGE
OF THE SPACESHIP
By Arthur C. Clarke
This is a historic article. It was written ten years before the launching
of the world's first artificial satellite in October 1957, and shows the
remarkable foresight of this world-renowned science writer. Arthur
C. Clarke, former chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, won
the Unesco Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science, in 1962.

flN historian of the twenty-
first century, looking back past our
own age tö the beginnings of human
civilization, will be conscious of four
great turning points which mark the
end of one era and the dawn of a new
and totally different mode of life.
Two of these events are lost, prob¬
ably forever, in the primeval night
before history began. The invention of
agriculture led to the founding of sett¬
led communities and gave man the lei
sure and social intercourse without
which progress is impossible. The
taming of fire made him virtually inde¬
pendent of climate and, most important
of all, led to the working of metals and
so set him upon the road of techno¬
logical development that road which
was to lead, centuries later, to the
steam engine, the Industrial Revolu¬
tion, and the age of steel and petrol
and surface transportation through
which we are now passing.

CHALLENGE OF THE SPACESHIP (Continued)
The third revolution began, as all
the world knows, in a squash-court in
Chicago on December 2, 1942, when
the first self-sustaining nuclear reac¬
tion was started by man. We are still
too close to that cataclysmic event to
see it in its true perspective, but we
know that it will change our world, for
better or for worse, almost beyond
recognition. And we know too that it is
linked with the fourth and in some
ways greatest change of all the
crossing of space and the exploration
of the other planets.
The first spaceships capable of rea¬
ching another world may still lie half
a century ahead, but the giant rocket
is already with us and will soon be
carrying men to the limits of the atmos¬
phere and beyond. Nor will it be many
years before a guided missile reaches
the moon and blazes the trail along
which men will travel a generation later.
An attempt to construct a philoso¬
phy of astronautics is therefore far
from premature: it is, if anything, a
little belated. In the last few years
we' have seen the political and ethical
chaos produced when a great technical
development comes into a world which
is unprepared for it.
If our civilization is to have a future,
then we must see that it does not
repeat its earlier mistakes. I do not
suggest as some have done that
lawyers need start worrying immedia¬
tely about the ownership of the moon,
but the ownership of space will soon
be a matter of acute practical impor¬
tance. This problem will be of grave
concern in another decade, when long-
range research projectiles begin to
travel far outside the atmosphere with
a supreme indifference to the geogra¬
phy beneath them.
I
26
HERE was a time not long
ago when those who advocated
interplanetary travel were always
being asked, "How?". It is amusing
to recall that in those days which
now seem so remote there were many
people who refused to believe that a
rocket could work in a vacuum or
would ever be able to rise more than
a few miles from the earth.
Today, the power of the rocket has
been demonstrated, only too thorough¬
ly. "How" is a question one seldom
hears in discussions concerning space¬
flight: the commoner query is now
"Why?" And it is much more difficult
to answer, for it involves the motives
underlying all human conduct.
The urge to explore, to discover, to
"follow knowledge like a sinking star",
is a primary human impulse which
needs, and can receive, no further jus¬
tification than its own existence. The
search for knowledge, said a modern
Chinese philosopher, is a form of play.
If this be true, then the spaceship,
when it comes, will be the ultimate toy
that may lead mankind from its clois¬
tered nursery out into the playground
of the stars.
It is not hard to think of entirely valid
"practical" reasons why one should
wish to cross space. There is no doubt
that eventually sheer necessity would
bring about the conquest of the other
planets. I do not believe that it is
possible to have a virile, steadily-ad¬
vancing culture limited to a single
world, and taking the long-term view,
we know that our earth will one day
become uninhabitable.
In his book, The Birth and Death of
the Sun, the physicist George Gamow
points out that before its evolution has
finished, our sun will become 100 times
as luminous as it is today. I am glad
to see that he draws the obvious con¬
clusion and visualizes the migration of
humanity to the outer planets before
our earth's oceans have begun to boil.
But the human race will not wait
until it is kicked out. Long before the
sun's radiation has shown any measu¬
rable increase, man will have explored
all the solar system and, like a cau¬
tious bather testing the temperature of
the sea, will be making breathless little
forays Into the abyss which separates
him from the stars.
To support my argument, I now have
to develop some sort of time-scale.
I do this with much reluctance, since
prophecy is a dangerous and thankless
business, frequently fatal to those who
practise it. We have, however, learned
by past experience that even the most
extravagant forecast seldom overtakes
the truth.
The advances in rocket research
since the 1940s have been phenome¬
nal, but they have merely laid the foun¬
dations for what is still to come. Dur¬
ing the next decade, the techniques
necessary to send small, radio-control¬
led rockets to the moon will become
available.
There is no reason why such flights
should not take place by 1960. The
public, not realizing the problems still
to be faced, will expect human beings
to follow in a very short time. It will
be disappointed. During the subse¬
quent years there will be innumerable
short-range flights beyond the atmos¬
phere by man-carrying ships reaching
heights of a few thousand kilometres.
But if we have to rely on chemical
fuels, it may require at least 20 years
of further experimenting before the first
true spaceship lands on the moon and
returns to earth.
That brings us to the late 1970s. Any
chemically fuelled spaceships will be
unwieldy, fabulously expensive ma¬
chines with fuel consumptions measur¬
ed by the thousand tons for a single
voyage. Not more than one or two
countries will be able to build them,
and they will be of scientific value only.
There will be no question, for a very
long time, of colonization or of voyages
to the other planets. But and it is a
very large but any prophet would in¬
deed be rash if he based his predic¬
tions upon the use of chemical fuels
alone.
question-mark is atomic energy. In
theory, a few kilogrammes of uranium
could take a ship weighing 1,000 tons
to the moon and back. In practice, we
have a very long way to go before this
can be done.
The fact that it is not possible for
any spaceship to carry enough fuel for
a voyage to another planet and back
has long focused attention on what
have been called "orbital techniques".
Once a rocket is above the atmosphere
and therefore no longer subject to air
resistance, it becomes theoretically
possible for it to turn itself into a sort
of "artificial moon". It could wait
effortlessly until "tanker" rockets were
sent up to refuel it: then, when its
supplies had been replenished, it could
continue on its way.
In this manner any interplanetary
journey can be broken down into a
number of stages, with refuelling bet¬
ween them, and this procedure is be¬
lieved to be the key to space-flight.
It seems likely that we may use the
present-day "chemical" rockets to
climb up from earth into the refuelling
orbit, and then continue from there
using atomic or "ion" rockets.
A,kTOMIC power is hardly
likely to advance the conquest of
space by more than 10 years, but it
may make it practical almost from
the beginning which otherwise would
certainly not have been the case.
What is equally important, it will mean
that the whole solar system, and not
merely the moon, will be immediately
accessible to man.
It requires little more power to reach
the planets than it does to go to the
moon, but the most economical voy¬
ages involve months or event years of
free "coasting" along orbits curving
halfway round the sun. With atomic
power these journeys could be cut to
a fraction of the time. For example,
the "cheapest" journey to Mars as far
as fuel is concernedlasts 258 days.
With an atomic ship, travelling by a
more direct route at quite a moderate
speed, it need take only a few weeks.
The last quarter of this century will
be an age of exploration such as man
has never before known. By the year
2000 most of the major bodies in the
solar system will probably have been
reached, but it will take centuries to
examine them all in any detail.
Those who seem to think that the
moon is the goal of interplanetary tra¬
vel should remember that the solar
system contains eight other planets,
at least 30 moons, and some thousands
of asteroids. The total area of the
major bodies is about 250 times that
of earth, though the four giant planets
probably do not possess stable sur¬
faces on which landings could be
made. Nevertheless, that still leaves
an area 10 times as great as all the
land surface of the earth.
Here, as In other fields, the great This, then, is the future which lies

before us, if our civilization survives
the diseases of its childhood. It is a
future which some may find terrifiying,
as no doubt our ancestors found the
hostile emptiness of the great oceans.
But the men who built our world cros¬
sed those oceans and overcame those
fears. If we fail before the same test,
our race will have begun its slide into
decadence.
When the great explorers of the past
set sail into the unknown they said
goodbye for years to their homes and
everything they knew. Our children
will face no such loneliness. When
they are among the outermost planets,
when the earth is lost in the glare of
the sun and the sun itself is no more
than the brightest of the stars, they
will still be able to hear its voice and
to send their own words in a few hours
back to the world of men.
The most obvious and direct result
of the crossing of space will be a
revolution in almost all branches of
science. One can never predict the
outcome of any scientific investigation
and the greatest discoveries the ones
which will most influence human life
may come from sciences as yet
unborn.
Astronomy and physics will, of
course, be the fields of knowledge
most immediately affected. In both
these sciences there are whole areas
where research has come to a dead
end, or has never even started,
because our terrestrial environment
makes it impossible.
The atmosphere, which on a clear
night looks so transparent, is in reality
a coloured filter blocking all rays
beyond the ultra-violet.
An observatory on the moon, work¬
ing with quite small instruments, would
be many times as effective as one
on earth. Far greater magnifications
could be employed, and far longer
exposures used. In addition, the low
gravity would make relatively simple
the building of larger telescopes than
have ever been constructed on this
planet.
/ In physics and chemistry, access to
vacua of unlimited extent will open up
quite new fields of investigation. The
electronic scientist may well look for¬
ward to the day when he can build
radio tubes a kilometre long, if he
wishes, merely by setting up his elec¬
trodes In the open! We may learn
more about gravity when we can
escape partially or wholly from its
influence.
The prospect of building stations in
space, circling the earth like tiny moons
in orbits beyond the atmosphere, is
one that has a peculiar fascination.
Meteorological observatories in space
could see at a glance the weather over
half the planet, could watch in detail
the movement of storms and rain
areas. Indeed, really accurate fore¬
casting may have to wait until meteor¬
ologists get out into space.
The space station has one other
application of the greatest importance,

LUNAR INTERNATIONAL LABORATORY
The moon's great potential for science can best be realized if investigations are conducted
as an international enterprise and in an international laboratory. This idea gave rise
to the Lunar International Laboratory Committee of the International Academy of Astro¬
nautics. The committee came into being in August 1960 when the concept of a lunar
international laboratory (LIL) was put forward at Stockholm during the 11th Congress of
the International Astronautical Federation. As Dr. Frank J. Malina, Chairman of the
LIL Committee, has stated: "lust about every branch of science will find the moon,
with its unique environmental conditions no atmosphere, a gravity only 1 /6th that of
the earth, very weak or non-existent magnetic field a great laboratory for a host of
experiments and observations essentially impossible to perform on earth." The foundations
for a Lunar International Laboratory may well have been laid on December 13, 1963 when
the General Assembly of the United Nations unanimously declared: "The exploration and
use of outer space shall be carried on for the benefit and in the interests of all mankind."

for it provides perhaps the only means
of world-wide television broadcasting.
Three relay stations circling the earth
could provide a steady, reliable service
from pole to pole with no more power
output than that of a single present-
day station.
However, the first direct results of
astronautics may be less important
than its indirect consequences. This
has proved true in the past of many
great scientific achievements. Coper¬
nican astronomy, Darwin's theory of
evolution, Freudian psychology these
had few immediate practical results,
but their effect on human thought was
tremendous. We may expect the same
of astronautics.
With the expansion of the world's
mental horizons may come one of the
greatest outbursts of creative activity
ever known. The parallel with the
Renaissance, with its great flowering
of the arts and sciences, is very sug¬
gestive. Interplanetary travel is now
the only form of "conquest and em¬
pire" compatible with civilization.
Without it, the human mind, compelled
to circle forever in its planetary gold¬
fish bowl, must eventually stagnate.
We all know the narrow, limited type
of mind which is interested in nothing
beyond its town or village, and bases
its judgments on parochial standards.
We are slowly perhaps too slowly
evolving from that mentality towards
a world outlook.
Few things will do more to accel¬
erate that evolution than the conquest
of space. It is not easy to see how
the more extreme forms of nationalism
can long survive once men see the
earth in its true perspective as a
single small globe among the stars.

HE solar system is rather a
large place, though whether it will be
large enough for so quarrelsome an
animal as Homo sapiens remains to be
seen. But it is surely reasonable to
hope that the crossing of space will
have a considerable effect in reducing
the psychological pressures and ten¬
sions of our present world.
Much depends, of course, on the
habitability of the other planets. It is
not likely that very large populations
will, at least for many centuries, be
able to subsist outside the earth.
There may be no worlds in the solar
system upon which men can live
without mechanical aids, and some of
the greatest achievements of future
engineering will be concerned with
shaping hostile environments to human
needs.
We must not, however, commit the
too common mistake of equating mere
physical expansion, or even increasing
scientific knowledge, with "progress"
however that may be defined. Only
little minds are impressed by sheer
size and number. There would be no
virtue in possessing the universe if it
brought neither wisdom nor happiness.
Yet possess it we must, at least in
spirit, if we are ever to answer the
questions that men have asked in vain
since history began.
Every thoughtful man has asked him¬
self: is our race the only intelligence,
or are there other, perhaps far higher,
forms of life elsewhere? There can be
few questions more important than this,
for on its outcome may depend all
philosophy yes, and all religion too.
The first discovery of planets revolv¬
ing round other suns, which was made
in the United States in 1942, has
changed all ideas of the plurality of
worlds. Planets are far commoner
than we had believed: there may be
thousands of millions in the galaxy
alone. Few men today would care to
argue that the earth must be the only
abode of life in the whole of space.
It is true it is even likely that we
may encounter no other intelligence in
the solar system. That contact may
have to wait for the day, perhaps ages
hence, when we can reach the stars.
But sooner or later it must come.
If the universe does hold species
greatly in advance of our own, then
why have they never visited the earth?
There is one very simple answer to this
question. Let us suppose that such
races exist: let us even suppose that,
never having heard of Einstein, they
can pass from end to end of the galaxy
as quickly as they wish-
That will help them less than one
might think. In 10 minutes, a man may
walk along a beach but in his whole
lifetime he could not examine every
grain of sand upon it. For all that we
know, there may be fleets of survey
ships diligently charting and recharting
the universe. Even making the most
optimistic assumptions, they could
scarcely have visited our world in the
few thousand years of recorded his¬
tory.
The desire to give a comprehensive
picture of the outcome of astronautics
has compelled me to range not
unwillingly over an enormous field.
However, I do not wish anyone to
think that the possibilities we have
been discussing need come in this
century, or the next, or the next. ... Yet
any of them may arise, at any time,
as soon as the first ships begin to
leave the earth. Man's first contact
with other intelligent races may lie as
far away in time as the building of the
Pyramids or it may be as near as the
discovery of X-rays.
Of this, at least, we may be fairly
certain: barring accidents the most
obvious of which I need not specify
the exploration of the planets will be
in full swing as this century draws to
its close. To examine them in any
detail, and to exploit their possibilities
fully, will take hundreds of years. But
man being what he is, when his first
ship circles down into the frozen
wastes of Pluto, his mind will already
be bridging the gulf still lying between
him and the stars.

MY
FIRST
STEPS
IN
SPACE
By Aleksei Leonov
March 18. 1965 is a date that will
be remembered in the history of
astronautics. On that day, Aleksei
Leonov became the first man to
leave a space vehicle and walk in
outer space. This article was
specially written for the "Unesco
Courier" by Aleksei Leonov him¬
self and published in our June
1965 issue.
0INLY the unforgettable mo¬
ments at the take-off and the recollec¬
tion of the long months of flight training
forced me to believe in the reality
of the scene that unfolded before my
eyes as I viewed the spaceship while
I floated through the vacuum of space.
Voskhod II sailed with an awesome
majesty, its antennae like the whis¬
kers of some monster probing the
emptiness of space. Its portholes
looked like enormous eyes contemp¬
lating fixedly my every movement.
Before me blackness: an inky-black
sky studded with stars that glowed
but did not twinkle; they seemed immo¬
bilized. Nor did the sun look the same
as when seen from Earth. It had no
aureole or corona; it resembled a huge
incandescent disc that seemed em¬
bedded in the velvet black of the sky
of outer space.
Below me our sky-blue planet drifted
by. It did not look round but complete¬
ly flat, like a giant physical map. Only
the curvature of the horizon showed
that it was round.
Four years ago my countryman Yuri
Gagarin, spent only 108 minutes in
space. Today manned spacecraft make
flights lasting several days.
In the future, space vehicles will be
spending more and more time in orbit,
and there will probably be several in
flight at the same time. The number
of crew members will also increase.
Scientists are already studying the
problem of setting up permanent
stations in orbit. Man will naturally
want to explore other planets.
But if this is to be possible man
must learn to assemble heavy space¬
craft directly in orbit. He must be
able to pick up the crews of orbiting
space laboratories, move from one
ship to another in cases of emergency

or simply maintain contact with fellow
human beings during interplanetary
flight.
For this to be feasible, man had to
learn to leave his spacecraft and find
the best way of doing so. But the
question arose was it possible for
man to leave a space vessel and sur¬
vive? Could he carry out the assembly
work that is indispensable to the ren¬
dezvous of spacecraft?
Pavel Belyayev, commander of
Voskhod II, and I had the good fortune
of being chosen for the space flight
of March 18 that aimed to give the
first answers to these questions.
Commander Belyayev started pre¬
paring me for my exit from the craft
when we were over Kamchatka. He
helped me to put on the cylinder
containing my air supply. I checked
the connexions linking my breathing
mixture to the spacesuit. Belyayev
opened the inner door of the air
lock. Together we fastened to my
spacesuit the tether-cable that would
keep me attached to the ship. I un¬
strapped myself from the seat and
floated into the chamber of the air lock.
I gave a hand signal to the com¬
mander. The inner door closed behind
me. Belyayev began to empty the
chamber of air in order to equalize the
pressure with that outside the ship.
I could feel this happening from the
way my spacesuit became inflated.
I made my way forward in the lock
toward the exit and poked a bit of my
head out. We were over the Mediter¬
ranean. I was in a hurry to leave the
lock, get a look at the Earth from space
and see the ship.
Belyayev signalled me to cast off.
In my impatience to get out, I pushed
off too vigorously from the edge of
the air lock and left the ship like a
cork popping from a bottle. Below
directly underneath me was the
Crimea. I saw the Black Sea, the
blue swath of the bay near Novo-
rossisk, the cloud-capped mountains
of the Caucasus.
I found myself spinning and was
powerless to control it. I had had the
same experience when Belyayev and
I were practising in the aeroplane-
laboratory the technique of exit and
re-entry under conditions of weight¬
lessness. So I did nothing about it.
I merely waited for the kinking of the
tether to slow down the rotations.
And, as I expected, the angular mo¬
mentum decreased little by little. I
was, of course, still turning on a
transversal axis. I could have check¬
ed this by grabbing hold of the tether,
but I preferred to keep on rolling
because this enabled me to see better.
Below, the majestic green mountain
ranges of the south of the U.S.S.R.
floated by. I recognized the Volga;
then I saw the Urals, and the mighty
Siberian rivers, the Ob and the Yenisei.
I removed the lens guard of the
motion picture camera that was to
photograph all of my movements in
the vacuum of space. It was mounted
on a special stand near the edge of
the air lock. A moment later, to pull
myself foward, I tugged rather vigor¬
ously at the tether and found the
ship bearing down .on me. I warded
it off with my hands, otherwise I might
have knocked my pressurized helmet
against its hull. By stretching out my
arms I was able to break the impact.
It is clear that once man has adapted
himself to the extraordinary conditions
in space, he can move about in a
co-ordinated and precise manner.
While in space, I was constantly in
telephonic contact with Pavel Belyayev
and with Earth. I spoke to Yuri
Gagarin who was on duty in the control
room of the spaceport.
While over the Yenisei, Commander
Belyayev gave me the signal to re¬
enter the ship. I was feeling wonder¬
ful and was in no hurry to leave open
space. So I pushed off once again
from the edge of the air lock as 1
wanted to find out what produced the
angular movements immediately follow¬
ing the push-off. It turned out that
these movements were caused by even
the slightest displacement in the angle
of the force of thrust in relation to the
axis of the space capsule.
I then carried out Commander Bel-
yayev's order and began to approach
the ship. On the way I picked up the
camera from its support.
I wanted to enter the air lock di¬
rectly, but this was far from easy.
The inflated spacesuit constricted my
movements. I had to use all of my
strength to re-enter the air lock. But
before long I was back in the cabin
alongside Pavel Belyayev.
So ended the experiment in which
a man climbed out of a capsule into
space. I had spent twenty minutes
outside the cabin. During this time,
Voskhod II had gone far. from the
Mediterranean over which we had
been travelling when I first went into 00
the air lock; we were now approach- *
ing the Pacific Ocean.

VERNACULAR
LANGUAGES
IN CHANGING
AFRICA
W,|E have become so used
to talking about Africa's countless lan¬
guages that we have lost sight of the
fact that Africa is, after all, a whole
continent. A more than cursory exami¬
nation of the languages of this conti¬
nent reveals first, that the number has
been vastly exaggerated, and second,
that the situation is hardly different
elsewhere. Europe possesses dozens
of languages and dialects; and "Stan¬
dard African" is as much of a mis¬
nomer as "Universal European" would
be. French and Italian exist as separ¬
ate languages, so why not Swahili,
Hausa and Yoruba?
Despite the existence of local varia¬
tions, the number of linguistic zones
in Africa is really quite small. Within
each zone there is a linguistic unity
which is not only historical but also
a living fact.
Let us take the case of the zone
comprising the so-called Bantu lan¬
guages. Here we find not various
distinct and separate languages but
different dialects of the same language.
The common features are so extensive
that one can pass quite easily from
one dialect to the other.
In the Congo practically everyone
is multilingual. In addition to their
local dialects, the Lari, the Vili, the
Bateke, the Bangala and the Kikongo
all speak Lingala, Monokotuba or some
other language.
From the number of dialects the Vili
of Pointe-Noire understand one might
assume that they have a special apti¬
tude for foreign languages. A Vili, for
example,\can easily understand or get
along in Lari, Teke, Swahili and Chilu-
ba. This is simply explained by the
fact that they are all dialectal varia¬
tions of one and the same language.
The slight differences in these dialects
is evident from the following renditions
for the word TO EAT: KULIA in Vili;
PATHE DIAGNE of Senegal is a specialist in
linguistics and African history and sociology.

KUDIA in Kikongo; KUDIA in Lari;
KOLIA in Lingala; KULIA In Swahili.
As can be seen, the differences are
merely a matter of one consonant or
vowel, and serve to Illustrate the Idea
that the whole Bantu linguistic zone
could today be unified around one of
these dialects. This unification would
affect some 100 million persons.
What is true of the Bantu linguistic
zone also applies to other parts of
Africa. In the Sudanese belt of coun¬
tries stretching across Africa just
below the Sahara, the same pheno¬
menon can be observed with regard
to Hausa, the Mandingo language
group (Bambara, Dioula, Malinke), the
Akan Baoule languages of Ghana and
the Ivory Coast, and the Fulani (or
Pular) languages.
All over the world a process of
linguistic unification is now under way.
In Africa the same thing Is happening.
Differences in speech are being worn
down, and are giving way to a limited
number of major languages of commu¬
nication. This is occurring as a result
of various factors. Urbanization, the
cultural» renascence and the develop¬
ment of great trading centres have
enabled a few languages to unify whole
areas.
This has completely transformed the
linguistic map of tropical Africa so that
many of the splinter dialects of the
past are now being absorbed by about
a dozen dynamic, hard-core languages
today spreading across the continent.
Most of these languages are now
used by groups of 1 million to 12 mil¬
lion persons. But some are spoken
by over 50 million people. For exam¬
ple, there Is the Bantu group, spoken
by 100 million people; Swahili, spoken
by over 50 million persons in most of
East Africa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania,
Zambia and the Democratic Republic
of the Congo); the Lingala-Kikongo-
Monokotuba language family, spoken
by about 30 million persons over most
of Central Africa (Central African Re-

public, Congo-Brazzaville, Cameroon
as well as the Democratic Republic of
the Congo).
The establishment of a common
language for those who speak Swahili,
Lingala-Kikongo-Monokotuba, or even
Shango and certain Bantu dialects of
South Africa and the Cameroon, is
a task that could well be accomplished
within the reasonable future.
The languages of West Africa are
more varied. Here, Hausa, spoken by
some 40 million people in Nigeria,
Niger and Chad, could become a
unifying element for a vast area of
Africa.
Yoruba (Nigeria), Malinke - Dioula
(Eastern Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta,
Ivory Coast, Niger), Fulani (Senegal,
Mali, Guinea, Upper Volta, Niger,
Nigeria), and Arabic are all linguistic
groups spoken by from 10 to 15 mil¬
lion people.
Tamashek (Mauritania, Mali, Niger),
Ibo (Nigeria), Akan-Baoule-Bulu-Fang
(Ghana, Ivory Coast), Fon-Ewe-Mina
(Togo, Dahomey, Ghana), More (Upper
Volta), Wolof (Senegal), Sarakhule
(Mali, Mauritania, Senegal), Kanuri
(Nigeria, Niger, Chad), and Djerma-
Songhoi (Mali, Niger) also form lin¬
guistic areas in process of unification
and are spoken by 1 to 5 million
people.
Thus we see that a veritable pyra¬
mid of languages exists in West Africa,
with several languages spoken in the
same country in Nigeria, for instance,
Hausa, Ibo, Yoruba and Kanuri are all
spoken.
But it is clear that language unifica¬
tion, not dispersal, is the dominant
factor in Africa today.
Efforts to try to adapt African lan¬
guages to modern change have been
in progress for many many years.
These were given new impetus with
the establishment of institutions of
European origin.
In 1820, a French schoolteacher set
up West Africa's first secular, bilingual
school at St. Louis, Senegal, where
both Wolof and French were taught.
This pioneer attempt was followed by
the missionaries who first used African
languages to spread the Gospel and
then gradually introduced them for the
teaching of a few new techniques in
agriculture and the crafts.
The bilingual school in the Congo
was the outcome of this development.
In the countries under British rule, a
similar approach, based on the prin¬
ciple of "native administration", helped
the spread of African languages. The
status and Influence of these lan¬
guages can be observed today in the
Democratic Republic of the Co.igo,
Uganda and Tanzania. These countr¬
ies, with a literacy rate of 45 per cent,
have been able to establish an excell¬
ent political, social and technical infra¬
structure by using African languages
for newspapers, school books and
other publications.
The interesting features here are
the new possibilities thus opened.
The development of a script in Swahili
hastened the stabilization of the lan¬
guage and its literary growth which
had begun long before colonization,
as attested by the Kilwa dating from
the 17th century as well as an abun¬
dance of other great works of great
antiquity.
This is equally true of other African
languages, particularly those of West
Africa, where Fulani and Wolof litera¬
ture, Hausa works (those by Dan Fodio
are an outstanding example) and the
writings of the Kanuri and Dendi chro¬
niclers bear comparison with Swahili.
Other languages like Lingala or Chi-
luba are entering the writing stage,
thanks chiefly to contemporary efforts.
T,HE adaptation of African
languages to modern change is not yet
very far advanced. In this sense most
of them have not yet become languages
of advanced scientific knowledge or
vehicles of modern literature, reflect¬
ing either in original creative works or
translations from non-African lan¬
guages, the intellectual ferment of con¬
temporary thought.
Although many attempts have been
made along these lines, they are
mainly isolated cases. Nevertheless, a
number of notable examples by out¬
standing African thinkers can be cited.
The Senegalese writer, C. Anta Diop,
has played a pioneer rôle here. The
second part of his Nations Nègres
contains a series of chapters which
illustrate how Wolof can be adapted
to modern scientific writing. Anta
Diop chose literary as well as scientific
themes and produced translations in
his native tongue of extraordinary
precision and clarity. His rendering
into Wolof of Einstein's Theory of Rel
ativity as interpreted and explained by
the French scientist Langevin, is su¬
perb.
He also offers us translations of
poems and excerpts of plays from
French literature that retain all the
exquisite beauty of the original. The
terminology of modern mathematics
and physics which he uses opens the
way for elaboration of a modern scien¬
tific culture In the Wolof language.
Wolof, it is true, is a language with
a long literary tradition. C. Anta Diop
makes this abundantly clear in his book
with a judicious choice of texts. Nev¬
ertheless what he has done for Wolof
can be done for any language, African
or not. Even more recently, the Presi¬
dent of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, dem¬
onstrated the vitality of African lan¬
guages by his series of literary works,
including a translation of Shake¬
speare's Julius Caesar.
For all languages there is a problem
of adaptation, but not of adaptability.
Linguists know that no language lacks
the ability to mould itself to a new
environment. Every language has its
own built-in system that meets the
needs of its people. The integration
of new knowledge is a matter of voca¬
bulary; it does not affect the system,
which is the structure of the language
on which the vocabulary rests.
Moreover, the need for adaptation
is not a problem exclusive to the lan¬
guages of Africa. It is world-wide.
Japan established its economic and
scientific force by assimilating modern
skills and knowledge into its own
language, and by introducing new tech¬
niques into its culture to which it gave
Japanese words or transliterated the
original foreign ones.
No language escapes this process.
Why is there a "Franglais" or a
"Japenglish" if not because English has

A remarkable example of the development of written language is that of an African
ruler, King Njoya of the B< mum (Cameroons) who invented a form of picture writing
at the end of the 19th century and within a few years transformed it into a syllabic,
phonetic alphabet, independently and without previous knowledge of alphabetic
scripts. After devising his writing system, King Njoya launched a large-scale campaign
to teach the alphabet to his people. Examples above show how reforms and simplification
during 11 years gave the Bamum script a more systematic form.

become the leading language of the
world as a result of the contribution of
American science and technology?
The best answer to the question
regarding the adaptability of African
languages to modern change is to
remind ourselves how easily modern
techniques are being assimilated into
African languages. It is a truism that
people do not accept all foreign words
indiscriminately. Train, ship, television,
mathematics, drugs in a word all the
elements of the new environment are
spontaneously translated, especially
by the women who often find graphic,
picturesque equivalents for them.
In Wolof, for example, the word for
train is saxar, for mathematics wann,
for drugs garab, all terms drawn from
the language itself. For words like
television, radar or atom, common-
sense operates in Africa as it has in
Japan, Germany or India, and the same
words are incorporated into the lan¬
guage with minor modifications or
none at all.
Today the great problem in Africa
is that of translation. School books
from the primary to the university level
must be translated to make them
available to students. This will faci¬
litate the broad diffusion of science
and technology in Africa. It Is easier,
cheaper and will reach more people.
A
nation's linguistic policy is
not decided by the individual. The indi¬
vidual can make known his suggestions,
his desires and his needs; but the final
word rests with the State. Specialists
agree that the use of the vernacular
for literacy campaigns and schooling
is certainly the best way to show one's
regard for the culture and traditions of
a people, and the most effective for
making the language the vehicle of
modern change; but the politician does
not always see things the same way
as the specialist.
However, an increasing number of
countries are exhibiting a refreshing
degree of understanding in this matter,
and this is encouraging. In addition
to those countries of Africa that have
traditionally practiced bilingualism bas¬
ed on the use of both an African lan¬
guage and a European one such as
Nigeria, Ghana, the Democratic Re¬
public of the Congo, Tanzania and
Uganda others like Niger, Guinea
and Mali have shown new interest in
the question.
Unesco's programme in Africa which
gives priority to the question of African
languages, shows that Unesco is
keenly aware of this problem and Its
effect on the continent's educational
and development policy.
Many details have as yet to be
worked out in agreement with Unesco's
African member countries; but the
proposals elaborated at the Unesco-
sponsored Congress of Bamako in
1965 for unification of certain African
scripts is a step in the right direction.

With the world's oceans a convenient dumping ground for radioactive waste,
scientists are on the alert for signs of contamination which could spread
for millions of square miles and ultimately endanger man through the food
he harvests from the sea.
THE POLLUTION
OF THE OCEAN
by Nicolai Gorsky
IJ HE amount of radioactive
substances dissolved in the waters of
the oceans and seas is infinitesimal
and the highly diversified plant and
animal life of the seas and oceans is
accustomed to a very low concentra¬

OUR POISONED PLANET
In the name of progress, Man has opened a
20th century Pandora's Box of smoke, sewage, smog,
detergents and noise which together form one of
the great problems of our age the. pollution of our
planet. We have been dumping waste into rivers
and lakes, fouling the air we breathe, damaging the
soil, and assailing each other with noise, that
by-product of technological civilization which increases
nervous strain, deafness and other mental and physical
disorders (photo bejow). A new noise, the boom of
the supersonic jetliner, will soon be added. Map,

POLLUTION OF THE OCEAN (Continued)
spread over an area of over one million
square miles.
Due to the rapid development of the
atomic industry the problem of safely
disposing of radioactive waste-pro¬
ducts has become urgent. In Britain,
radioactive wastes are in some places
drained by pipes into the Irish Sea,
while at Oak Ridge in the United States
they are drained into the Tennessee
River system. Some wastes in the-
United States are buried in the ground
or sunk in the deep sea in special
containers.
The sea water, however, will very
quickly eat through the walls of these
containers and dissolve their danger--
ous contents. If scores, or hundreds,
of containers with their sinister con¬
tents are being thrown Into the sea
today, the number will rise to tens or
hundreds of thousands in the future.
There are deep places or trenches in
the oceans, particularly the Pacific.
The average depth of the ocean is
about two and a half miles, but in
these depressions it reaches between
four and five miles and in places up
to seven miles. Proposals are being
made to use these depressions
as dumping-grounds for radioactive
wastes.
How long will Í radioactive
substances dissolvi he water at
the ocean bottom to rise to the sur¬
face? Will the process of radioactive
decay which is always at work render
them innocuous before they reach the
surface, or will they still be sufficiently
radioactive to poison the upper, pro¬
ductive layers?
S CIENTISTS hold widely
differing views as to the time required
for the water of the ocean bottom to
be renewed. Georg Wüst (Fed. Rep.
of Germany) has calculated that the
cold, heavy Antarctic waters, after des¬
cending to the depths, reach the
equator in five years four months,
while G.E.R. Deacon (Britain) puts the
figure at eighteen years. E.B. Worth-
ington (United States) holds that the
waters at the. bottom of. the Atlantic
date back to 1810 when the .climate
became much colder, and have not
been renewed in the century and a
half that has elapsed since then.
The New Zealand oceanographers,
Brodie and Burling, have put the age
of the Antarctic waters north of Scott
Island at a depth of 8,500 feet at
2,500 years," and of the waters near
Campbell Island at a depth of 2,624 feet
at 1,900 years. The New Zealanders
used the Carbon 14 method to deter¬
mine the age of the water, but others
hold that there are a number of factors
besides time affecting Carbon 14, and
accordingly that these conclusions
must be accepted with caution.
The Danish expedition on the Galatea
and Soviet expeditions on the Vityaz
found dissolved oxygen in water from
the very deepest Pacific trenches.
Water buried at the bottom of the
ocean for hundred of years, let-alone
thousands, could contain no oxygen.
It would be consumed in a much
shorter time by various processes,
both physico-chemical (the oxidation of
mineral substances) and biochemical
(the respiration of living organisms
and the putrefaction of dead ones)
processes that are constantly at work
at the bottom of the ocean and in- the
water above.
The. Danish and Soviet expeditions
discovered various forms of animal life
at the bottom of the ocean trenches,
which had till then been thought to be
void of life. All these animals con¬
sume oxygen continually and they
would long since have exhausted the

The. primitive notion that a river is a sewer has
caused many of the world's waterways to stagnate
and die, killing off their once-teeming plant and
fish life (above). Man's heavy hand is often most
obvious in cities and industrial complexes (right)
where pollution In all its forms creates a choking,
poisoned environment.
supply in the water round them if
there were no currents.
The water in the ocean is not homo¬
geneous; its temperature varies both
vertically and horizontally. What is
more, the water in the ocean is contin¬
ually in motion, neighbouring layers
often moving in different directions.
In this way water of different temper¬
atures is being constantly mixed and
is sinking as it becomes heavier. An
equivalent volume of lighter water is
displaced and rises to the surface.
This eternal process extends to all
the depths of the ocean, apparently
penetrating to the bottom of the
trenches.
We do not know as yet how long it
takes surface water to descend to the
ocean bottom, but evidently its move¬
ment is relatively rapid since it retains
dissolved oxygen.
Among the many depressions studied
by this year's Soviet expedition on the
Vityaz was the Tonga trench, investigat¬
ed six years ago by the Danish expedi¬
tion on the Galatea. Measurements
made this year gave a difference of
0.2o in the temperature of the water.
When one takes into consideration
the great accuracy of the deep-water
thermometers used by oceanographers.
one realizes that this is a significant
deviation indicating the existence of
what is probably a very slow but
continuous exchange of water between
the bottom, intermediate, and surface
layersvof the ocean, even in the regions
of the deepest depressions.
T HE vertical circulation ven¬
tilates the deep layers of the ocean
and also raises to the surface a layer
rich in nutrient phosphates and nitra¬
tes, forming a basis for abundant'life.
But this process will bring death if
pernicious radioactive solutionis from
the wasteproducts of the atomic indus¬
try accumulate In the ocean depths.
There is another phenomepon occur-
ing in the oceans and seas' known as
upwelling. Due to winds, currents or
the relief of the ocean bed, deep, cold
layers of water, rich in nutrient salts,
rise to the surface in some regions
along the continental slope or along
submerged banks. This occurs regu¬
larly along the Atlantic coast of North
America, the California coast and the
western coast of South America and
Africa. The regions where upwelling
occurs are exceptionally rich in plant
and animal life, including fish. If the
water rising to the surface should be
contaminated with substances dis¬
solved from radioactive wastes it will
mean the end of the highly productive
fisheries in these regions.
The oceans and seas are joined to
.form an indivisible whole the World
Ocean. No open part can be con¬
sidered isolated and cannot belong to
any one country. Radioactive sub¬
stances introduced into the ocean at
any spot will be dispersed for
thousands of miles and will con¬
taminate an area of millions of square
miles.
For that reason, all questions con¬
cerning the contamination of the ocean
by radioactive substances, irrespective
of their origin or purpose, acquire
international significance and should be
solved through friendly, concerted
international scientific co-operation.
The rate at which the atomic indus¬
try is developing shows that it is
necessary to set about the study of
this problem immediately. Uncon¬
trolled contamination of the oceans and
seas can lead to Irreparable catas¬
trophe within ten to twenty years. The
Ocean, that great and inexhaustible
source of food for man, is in danger.

700 MILLION
FORGOTTEN MINDS
by René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
A,
36
iN estimated 700 million
adults or more than two-fifths of the
world's total population are illiterate.
And it is in the less developed regions
that most of these adult Illiterates live.
As for children (5 to 15 years), 47
per cent did not attend school during
1960 in the countries of Latin America,
Africa, the Middle East and Asia. If
we add to this figure those children
who are going to school now but who
will drop out before they master read¬
ing and writing and hence will grow
up illiterate, there are today 150 million
future illiterates in these countries and
there will be an additional 20 to
25 million illiterates added to the
world's adult population in the next
6 or 7 years.
What a frightful loss of mindpower
these hundreds of millions of illiterates
represent. Who can say how many
scientists, engineers and technicians
potentially existed among all these
forsaken adults as well as the children
consigned from birth to the shadows
of Ignorance?
An illiterate person never ceases
to be a human being endowed with
his own natural dignity and ability.
Nevertheless, illiteracy by the very fact
that it makes science and technology
a closed book renders active partici¬
pation in modern civilization im¬
possible.
A country with a high percentage of
illiterates does not only suffer an in¬
trinsic loss In terms of wasted man
and mindpower; the progress of the
educated segment of the population
is equally slowed down. We can no
longer afford to have, as we unfortu¬
nately do in many of the developing
countries, an enormous gulf separating
one group or generation from another,
that is, those who have had a modern
education from those who are illiterate.
This disrupts the equilibrium and
unity of a country and completely de¬
feats any effort to create a nation¬
wide positive attitude toward scientific
thinking and technology without which
there can be no real development.
Probably the greatest need for ex¬
pansion and improvement lies in the
field of technical and vocational edu¬
cation, particularly at the secondary
school level.
Here Unesco has devoted consider¬
able effort in recent years to helping
the developing countries in two differ
ent ways: by working on international
standards for technical education, and
by direct aid in the field.
As for the rôle of universities in
training senior scientific and technical
personnel, in certain countries the
problem is chiefly one of quantity.
Here the key word is shortage: a
shortage of universities, a shortage
of instructors and professors, a short¬
age of equipment, mainly laboratory
equipment, even a shortage at times
of adequately prepared students
arising from the inadequacies of
secondary education.
In other countries higher education
is poorly adapted to the needs of a
modern economy and technology.
Thus most of the university students
in these countries prepare for degrees
in traditional subjects; and those who
do major in science and technology
often do so by chance or for personal
reasons that have little to do with
the real top-priority problems of
economic and social development in
their country.
The evil of underdevelopment must
be attacked at its very root by creating
national structures for training qualified
personnel where they do not exist and
strengthening and improving them
where they do.
If a country is to build a sound foun¬
dation for its technological develop¬
ment science must be taught in the

schools at every level. The real basis
for development is a scientific civiliza¬
tion.
Merely importing techniques will
not itself equip the underdeveloped
countries for the full utilization of their
natural and human resources to
achieve their transformation.
T,_ HERE are many things
wrong with science teaching in the
developing countries. There is often
a terrible shortage of laboratory equip¬
ment for schools and universities.
In many cases, curricula are ill-
conceived, textbooks and teachers'
handbooks are not suited to local
conditions, and the training of teachers
leaves much to be desired.
In all these spheres, Unesco is
helping to promote and support the
efforts of its member states. Far
greater resources must be marshalled
by international aid for this vital
contribution to progress.
I do not believe that the educational
system, with its present organization
and methods, can meet the demands
of the growth of our civilization in the
developed countries, let alone those
in the developing areas.
Education cannot make its full and
decisive contribution to the technolo¬
gical revolution which must take place
in the less developed countries unless
it itself drastically overhauls its own
technology, which in many respects is
out of date.
We all know what a long and costly
process the training of teachers Is at
no matter what level. There can be
no question of economizing in this vital
field. But experience has shown that
for certain duties, assistants with far
less advanced training are quite
adequate. The savings made in this
way would be quite considerable.
Even the machines now being tried
out for programmed instruction reduce
the need for personal coaching by
the teacher.
The cinema, radio and television
not to overlook filmstrips and the gra¬
mophone have demonstrated over
and over again how potent they are
as means of conveying ideas, impart¬
ing knowledge, and expressing emo
tions and passions, too. Educators
should learn what the professional
entertainers and political propagandists
have already found out ¡n other fields:
that these media can play an enormous
rôle in advancing education in the
developing countries.
It is not in schools or universities
that the renewal or extension of
scientific education and technical
training must be effected. It must
take place wherever the main part of
an adult's life is spent at work and
during leisure hours.
Places of work are ideal centres for
specialized scientific and technical
education on a continuing basis.
Industry is becoming increasingly
aware of this educational responsibility
which it bears. This is a task on a
scale commensurate with modern
society as a whole.
Major Industrial and commercial
concerns are bound to assume more
and more the character of specialized
training establishments supplementing
the work of schools and universities.
The university, far from ignoring or
vying with them, should keep in close
touch in order to stimulate and guide
them, for they are its natural extension.
The considerable amount of leisure
made available by industrialization is
being increasingly taken over by the
mass communication media. It is from
these media that the vast majority
of adults and even a proportion of
those at school and university derive
the bulk of what I would term their
scientific and technical culture.
The diversity of situations which
distinguish the less-developed coun¬
tries from the industrialized ones
calls for different approaches to the
problems of development. But there
are no ways and means too novel
or modern for the less developed
countries in applying the solutions
adopted for those problems. This is
why the training of scientific and
technical personnel is so urgent a
necessity for them. For on this
personnel depends whether or not
they are to play a real part on the
contemporary scene.

AVICENNA
by Camille Aboussouan
A,l ROUND the year 1150, at
the height of the Middle Ages, the
scientific and philosophical works of
a great Persian thinker, named Avi¬
cenna, reached western Europe, in¬
troducing for the first time a complete,
organized system of natural philosophy
directly from the Orient.
This Persian scholar gave the world
a vast body of works 335 in all
dealing more with science than with
philosophy alone, which was to have
a resounding impact on the develop¬
ment of knowledge in the Western
World. For some 600 years, up until
the 18th century, Avicenna's works on
medicine remained the standard text¬
books in all the universities of Europe.
His studies on mathematics, physics,
chemistry, astronomy and botany, his
treatises on military administration
and land taxation, his epistle on love,
his correspondence with other scien¬
tists of his time, his philosophical, legal
and linguistic essays, and even his
commentaries on magic, all entitle him
to be considered as one of the most
remarkable figures of world civilization.
A thousand lunar years ago, In the
year 370 of the Hegira (980 A.D.),
Abu Ali al Husain ibn Abdallah ibn
Sina, known as Avicenna, was born at
Afsana, not far from Bokhara in Persia.
The special care and education given
him as a child permitted him to acquire
an erudition rare for his time. Though
Persian, he wrote many of his works
in Arabic, the scientific and religious
language of the Islamic world as Latin
then was in the Christian West. In his
native Persian he wrote several books
of verse, a treatise on pulsation and
a major work on the principles of
science, the Danesh-Nameh (1).
What we know about his life has
come down to us from Avicenna's own
writing, supplemented by those of his
disciple, AI Juzjani, and commentaries
of other writers.
Like all good Muslims, Avicenna
first studied the Koran; then Arabic
literature, Greek philosophy, law, theo¬
logy, medicine, geometry, physics and
mathematics. Euclid, Ptolemy and
Porphyrius were his preferred authors
until he was 16 when, more learned
than any of his teachers, he founded
his own school and had many doctors
working under him.
At the age of 18, his encyclopaedic
knowledge and reputation as a doctor
were so great that the ailing Emir
had him summoned to his bedside.
When Avicenna succeeded in curing
him, the Emir rewarded him by making

him a consultant on state affairs and
gave him access to his rich, private
library where he had plenty of free
time for research and study.
When he was 21, Avicenna pub¬
lished his first book, AI Majmuh, a
collection of philosophical writings. At
that time he became deeply Interest¬
ed in politics and left Bokhara to estab¬
lish himself in different courts of the
Emirs of northern Persia and the Cas¬
pian shore. It was in northern Per¬
sia that he began writing the Qanun
or "Canon of Medicine", and his first
epistles.
He then left for Rai (the ruins of
which can still be seen not far from
Teheran) where he attended the sick
prince Majd ad Dawla, and then for
Hamadan where he cured the Emir and
was named Vizier. There, Avicenna
dealt with state affairs during the day
and worked on his own studies at
night.
Some of his greatest works date
from this period: the Al-Shifa (On
Healing) and especially the Qanun fi-
t-tibb, his masterly work on medi¬
cine which was to become the "bible"
of all doctors in the East and West for
centuries. In this latter work Avicenna
showed that the real act of seeing
begins at the retina not the crystalline
lens as was commonly believed, cor¬
rectly defined meningitis as an inflam¬
mation of the brain membrane, recog¬
nized the various types of jaundice,
postulated the theory of the transmis¬
sion of certain diseases via the pla¬
centa, first proposed tracheotemy sur¬
gery, etc.
At the death of the Emir of Hama¬
dan, his enemies imprisoned Avicenna
in the fortress of Ferdajan. This en¬
forced retirement gave him leisure to
work in peace. But it did not last
very long. On his return to Hamadan,
where he no longer felt safe, he made
plans to flee to Isfahan with the aid
of his trusted companion AI Juzjani.
They slipped out of town disguised as
Sufis and after a 13 month journey
through hostile lands reached Isfahan
where they were received in honour
by the Emir Alai Addin.
Avicenna completed the Al-Shifa in
Isfahan, but this being a very lengthy
work, he made a summary of it (start¬
ed earlier) which is now famous as the
AI Nadjat.
Avicenna's thinking until this time
had been strongly influenced by Aris¬
totle, and these two books are no
exception. But during the later years
of his life, his work and thinking were
marked by a profound change.
This is clearly evident in his Kitab
al-lsarat wal-tanbihat, or "Book of
Theorems," the last of his works to
come down to us complete (2). The
Book of Theorems is the culmination
of Avicenna's thought. In it we see
the marked influence of Iranian scien¬
tific thinking, the development of his
rationalist (as opposed to mystico-
religious) thought.
Five hundred years before Harvey,
Bacon and the Renaissance, Avicenna
established a system of natural phil¬
osophy, neither Greek nor Persian,
but based on scientific experiment.
A universalist and rationalist, he com¬
bined in his works Greek and Oriental
philosophies and Iranian science, ex¬
pressed in an Arabic literary style and
sense of composition rarely attained.
The great philosopher and scientist
died at the age of 57 in Isfahan, the
city of roses, after freeing his slaves
and bequeathing all his property and
belongings to the poor.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS
AND WORLD SANITY
by Linus Pauling
Nobel Peace Prize 1962
Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1954
D.I URING the Second World
War there were some great bombing
raids on German cities. In one such
raid, on one night, one thousand aero¬
planes each carrying four tremendous
one-ton blockbusters destroyed much
of the city of Hamburg and killed an
estimated 75,000 people. If there were
to be such a raid on, say, Paris today
and another such 1,000 plane raid
tomorrow, and then another the next
day and so on day after day for
fourteen years, the explosives de- .
livered would have the power of one
20-megaton bomb.
Now, one 20-megaton bomb test in
the atmosphere or at the surface of
the earth liberates radioactive materials
into the atmosphere which will, accord¬
ing to the best estimates that we can
make, cause gross damage or death to
550,000 unborn children. This is the
probable sacrifice of the testing of a
single H-bomb by any one nation.
Everyone must understand this.
If the human race survives and world
population continues at a reasonable
level, then I have calculated that the
bomb tests carried out thus far, and
amounting to 600 megatons, will in the
course of time affect sixteen million
children so severely that they will
suffer gross physical or mental defects
or embryonic, neonatal, or childhood
deaths.
We know that large amounts of high
energy radiation produce cancer. If
we accept the principle that high
energy radiation even in small amounts
is also cancerogenic as I believe it
is then it is possible to calculate the
sacrifice of human beings now living to
the bomb tests.
The estimated figure is that two
million human beings now living will die

five, ten fifteen or twenty years earlier
than otherwise because of cancer or
other diseases produced by the high
energy radiation liberated in the bomb
tests carried out so far. This is about
one person in fifteen hundred in the
world, and it gives us some idea of the
nature of atomic weapons in so far as
the tests go.
Of course there would be a tremen¬
dously greater amount of contamination
with radioactive materials all over the
earth if there were to be a nuclear war.
In addition to the destructive and lethal
effects of blast, fire, and immediate
high energy radiation, there would be
the effects of local fall-out.
Survivors within hundreds of miles of
where the bombs exploded would
generally be exposed to about half of
the lethal dose that causes acute
radiation sickness and death within a
few days, and the survivors would have
their portion of the pool of human
germplasm seriously affected. Their
lives would be shortened considerably
on the average by some ten or
fifteen years by exposure to this high
energy radiation.
The standard nuclear bomb today is
the 20-megaton bomb. (One megaton
equals a million tons.) The Soviet
Union has detonated a 60-megaton
bomb, which was apparently only the

first two stages of a 100-megaton
bomb. A 100-megaton bomb involves
only about three and a half tons of
explosive material and probably can be
carried in a single large rocket from
one continent to another. But 100-
megaton bombs don't make very much
sense because a 20-megaton bomb
can destroy any city on earth.
A 20-megaton bomb exploded over
any city on earth would destroy it
completely and kill most of the people
in it. It would produce a crater of
twenty kilometres in diameter; it would
set off fires 50 to 100 kilometres away,
producing a tremendous fire storm and
would damage people by the immediate
high energy radiation and by the radio¬
active fallout. Even people 300 kilo¬
metres away would be killed.
My estimate is that the stockpiles
of the world comprise about 16,000 of
these 20-megaton bombs or the equi¬
valent of them. Now, there aren't
16,000 large cities in the world and
one might well ask why this irrationally
great amount of explosive material has
been produced.
I shall answer this by saying that it is
because the system of science edu
cation has been faulty in the past so
that the people who were making the
decisions could not have had a clear
understanding of what they were doing
if indeed anyone did make the deci¬
sions, for there has been some doubt
as to whether the development of these
tremendously great stockpiles was the
result of decision-making rather than
some sort of accident and shifting of
responsibility primarily in the United
States and the Soviet Union and per¬
haps in Great Britain to some extent.
And yet in the Franck Report written
by scientists working on the atomic
bomb project in the U.S. in 1945, a
prediction was made of the future
nuclear situation in the world which has
turned out to correct up to the present
time.
Three hundred and twenty thousand
megatons is my estimate of the size of
the world's present nuclear stockpiles.
If ten per cent of the stockpiles (32,000
megatons) were to be used in a nuclear
war with the bombs exploded on the
average within a hundred and fifty
kilometres of the targets (you don't
have to hit the target in order to get
the result) then 60 days after the day
on which the war was fought and we
assume that it would cover Europe as a
whole, all the Soviet Union and the
United States of the 800 million
people living in these regions, 720
million would be dead, 60 million
severely injured, and there would
be 20 million survivors with only minor
injuries.
But these survivors would have to
cope with the problems of complete
destruction of all cities, metropolitan
districts, and means of communication
and transportation, complete disruption
of society, death of all livestock, and
gross radioactive contamination of all
growing foods. This would be the
end of this part of the world, and how
great the damage would be to the rest
of the world no one has been able to
estimate in a reliable way.
The partial test ban treaty signed at
Moscow in 1963 was a great step
forward. I regret very much that this
treaty was not made three years earlier,
during the long period when no bomb
tests were carried out by any nation
except France, which only made very
small bomb tests.
Of the total of 600 megatons tested,
CONTINUED ON TAGE 46
140,000 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. The annual world expenditure on arms was roughly $140,000 million dollars
according to an estimate made in 1964. Since then the figure has considerably increased. Expenditure on arms is
equivalent to about one-tenth of the world's annual output of goods and services. It represents at least
two-thirds of the entire national income of all the developing countries. It is close to the value of the world's
annual exports of all commodities.

THE PEACE-LOVING
ATOM
Popular ignorance has given the atom a bad name. To the vast
majority, atomic energy means horrendous explosions and the
frightful weapons that could wipe out civilization. Atomic
science was wholly unknown to most persons when the first
atomic bomb was exploded and so it burst on mankind as an
unforgettable shock.
Yet this military use of the new knowledge is only one aspect.
To ignore the entire science of atomic energy, with all its possib¬
ilities for the good of mankind is like closing one's mind to all
aviation because, during the war, aviation provided the merciless
bomber. There is no attitude of horror today toward the
aeroplane. So too there is a world of benefit in the medical,
industrial and agricultural uses of the atom.
As the great explorers mapped the earth, and the astronomers
chart the sky, so the atomic scientist, delving into matter and
energy, has discovered an unknown world that ¡s a revelation
for philosophers and a vast resource for future generations.

NUCLEAR WEAPONS (Continued)
450 megatons or three-quarters of the
total were tested In the last three years.
Millions of unborn children were sacri¬
ficed because of the inability to see
that the test ban solution could have
been accepted three years earlier. I
hope that further mistakes of this sort
are not made. I am grateful for the
bomb test treaty, but of course we
must move forward. The test ban
treaty is just the beginning.
I should like to see some action
taken in the meantime that would
decrease the chance of outbreak of a
devastating nuclear war, perhaps
through some psychological or techno¬
logical accident or through some com¬
bination of circumstances such that
even the wisest of national leaders
could not prevent catastrophe.
In my Nobel lecture in Oslo In
December 1963 [delivered on the occa¬
sion of the award to Prof. Pauling of
the Nobel Prize for Peace] I proposed
that the American stockpile of nuclear
weapons and the Soviet stockpile of
nuclear weapons should, separately, be
put under joint national and interna¬
tional control, so that the Soviet
nuclear weapons could not be used
except with the permission both of the
Soviet Premier and of the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, and that
the American nuclear weapons could
not be used except by permission both
of the President of the United States
and of the Secretary-General of the
United Nations.
I also proposed that there should be
In authority in the control stations in
both . countries, United Nations per¬
sonnel as well as Soviet personnel in
the U.S.S.R. on the one hand and
U.N. personnel as well as American
personnel in the U.S.A. on the other.
I believe that even a first step in this
direction, the step of having United
Nations observers in these control
stations, would be of much value in
increasing our security and decreasing
the chance that these weapons would
be used.
I look forward to the time
when there is in existence In the world
a satisfactory system of international
law taking the place of war. In working
to abolish war from the world we are
working also for human freedom, for
the rights of individual human beings.
It is war, militarism, and extreme
nationalism that are the great enemies
of the individual human being in every
country. I believe that as we achieve
the goal of peace in the world and
disarmament, we shall see great
improvement in the social, political
and economic systems of all nations
and in the rights of individual human
beings all over the world.
The idea of replacing war by world
law is an old one and it has continued
to be advanced up to the present time.
Only now has the time come when it
will be accepted.

OF ANTS
AND MEN
by Sir James Gray
lAN's position in the world
of Nature is brought most sharply into
focus by the concept of natural evolu¬
tion. Cosmic, biological and human
evolution can be regarded as phases
in a continuous natural process and,
from this point of view, astronomy,
geology, biology, archaeology and
history form a continuous spectrum of
knowledge. To pass through many mil¬
lions of years from a primaeval nebula
to modern man without any sudden
break in continuity of thought gives a
feeling of intellectual tidiness, but quite
apart from this it enables us to vis¬
ualize Man against the background
of his past and to regard him as
Nature's supreme masterpiece. At the
same time, he must not get too big
for his biological boots or tend to
exaggerate the gap between himself
and the rest of the animal kingdom.
No animal can manufacture aero¬
planes, or Asdic; but the prize for
aeronautics must go to the shear¬
water which navigated the Atlantic
without compass or chart, that for
Asdic to the ears and vocal cords of
our nearer relatives, the bats. By
surrounding themselves with an elec¬
tric field, some fish (e.g. Gymnarchus)
can, in total darkness, detect foreign
objects in the surrounding water with
very remarkable precision.
The total weight of the mechanism
involved including the animal's brain
amounts only to a few grammes;
a man-made instrument of comparable
performance would involve at least a
ton of highly complex electronic ma¬
chinery. Again, there is no labora¬
tory in the world which can compete
with the biochemical skill of even the
smallest living organism.
In fact, as delicate and precise
pieces of machinery, Man's inventions
so far compare very unfavourably with
those which have come into existence
during the natural course of biological
evolution. On the other hand, we may
fairly claim that we have accomplished
in a few centuries things for which
Nature required many millions of years.
Nevertheless, we need not be in the
least ashamed of the older members
of our evolutionary family; we have
still a great deal to learn from them.
So as to visualize Man's posi¬
tion in the animal world, let us de¬
fine his main diagnostic characters.
He is a highly gregarious bipedal mam¬
mal with unspecialized limbs but a
very large brain. He is the only ani¬
mal which has developed the sym¬
bolisms of speech and writing, and he
may well be the only animal capable
of rational thought. He Is, therefore,
the only organism which can hand on
patterns of acquired learning from: one
generation to another. To these ad¬
vantages he owes his dominant posi¬
tion in the world today.
T,
SIR JAMES GRAY Is former president of the
British Association for the Advancement of
Science.
HEY have enabled him to
exploit his environment and increase
his numbers and his range of distribu¬
tion far more quickly and far more
extensively than any animal of com¬
parable size. He has eliminated some
of his competitors and exploited others
for his own use, but the time has now
come when different races of men
are competing with each other within
the closed arena of a limited environ¬
ment, and it Is not easy to see where
it will end.
There is nothing equivalent to this
in the inanimate world; but, when a
biologist looks at the general trend
of events, he is inclined to say, "Where
have I seen something like this before,
what is it due to, and how does it
usually end?"
Nature has made, not one, but two
great experiments in the design of
social animals. The first was carried
out in Mèsozoic times when Man's
mammalian ancestors were beginning
to emerge from reptiles. The results
of this experiment are represented
today by the social insects notably
the ants.
There are a very large number of
different species of ants, none of
which interbreed; among them is found
a range of complexity of social be¬
haviour which is not only unique in
the animal kingdom but which forms
a very remarkable parallel to different
races of human beings.

Each cotony has a highly orga¬

ants have become so lazy that
when the colony moves house
they have to be carried by slaves.
Each group of worker ants has
its own special Job. The roadbuild-

Down these roads the colony
migrates, accompanied by its cattle
and slaves, to take over new
territories, often waging war on
other ants in the process.
Ants are clever engineers. When
they reach a stream, a living
bridge of ants swings across over
which the whole column passes.
The job each ant will do is deter¬
mined from the time of its birth.
Cartoon story by Frank C Betts Ltd., Ö by Visual Features Ltd.. London
Ants are the result of Nature's
first great experiment in designing
social animals. Man came only
150 million years later. Has man,
as a social animal, progressed
much further than the ant?
February 1949
At one extreme are species forming
small communities, restricted to local¬
ized or specialized environments and
exhibiting relatively little subdivision
of labour between individuals.
At the other extreme are large and
often aggressive communities with
marked differentiation of structure bet¬
ween different grades of individuals;
populations of this type display high
levels of co-operative effort involving,
in some cases, the rudiments of agri¬
culture and husbandry:
In all cases, however, ant societies
are organized on a straightforward
totalitarian basis, the contribution made
by each individual towards the wel¬
fare of the community is determined
from the time of birth; each grade of
individual is structurally adapted for
predetermined tasks.
How far ants can communicate with
each other may be doubtful,, but it
is tolerably certain that members, of
the same community recognize each
other by a characteristic smell, and as
the brain of an ant is about the size
of the head of a pin, it is perhaps
not surprising that ants should attack
or kill an individual from another colony
with a smell slightly different to their
own. It is much less easy to under¬
stand why a man, with a brain of an
entirely different order of complexity,
should, at times, react almost equally
violently to skin pigments different
from his own.
Ants are also the only organisms
which apart from Man indulge in
organized warfare raiding the nests
of other species and incorporating
captives into their own societies. But
perhaps the most striking facts relate
to species which have changed their
habits and distribution within recent
times.
IWO instances of territorial
expansion are known to have occurred
in the last 150 years. Early in the
nineteenth century an Eastern species
(Pheidola megacephala), having spread
rapidly over North Africa and southern
Europe, managed to reach the islands
of Madeira and Bermuda; in both
places it exterminated the smaller
native races.
Meanwhile, a similar policy had
been carried out by another species
(Iridomyrmex humjlis), from the Argen¬
tine, which, having landed at New
Orleans, very rapidly overran the
southern United States; in due course,
it too reached Bermuda, where it pro¬
ceeded to eliminate the earlier invader.
In the world of ants there is no
place for small peaceful communities
unless they can isolate themselves
effectively from larger and more power¬
ful neighbours, nor does there seem
any lasting peace between large ag¬
gressive communities. Solomon's
advice has, I suspect, been misinter¬
preted. It should read: "Consider the
ants, and, if you use your intelligence,
you will see how not to deal with
international problems."
Having designed the ants, Nature
waited for about 150 million years be¬
fore embarking on her second or
human experiment. She waited, in
fact, until it could be carried out with
a species in which an individual's con¬
tribution to society was no longer
based on inherited structural char- s
acters but on the power of inter¬
communication with other individuals;
in other words, until Man's brain had
reached a level of development which
enabled him to control his environ¬
ment, and to deal rationally with the
subdivision of labour between indi¬
viduals and with the distribution of
natural resources between different
groups of individuals.
At the same time, she arranged that
such groups should not be physio¬
logically isolated from each other.
Different races of men can interbreed,
or they can, if they wish, come to
mutual agreement about the distribu¬
tion of world resources.
The first policy would seem to lead
to a world state with uniformity of
social pattern and of material interests;
the second involves territorial limita¬
tions and economic agreements. Both,
as we know only too well, involve
great practical difficulties. All the
same, men ought to be able to do
something better than ants.

Canaletto's paintings helped rebuild shattered
by Jerzy Hryniewiecki
48
IHE first of Warsaw's citizens who returned to the
city in January 1945 found nothing but a vague trace of its
former outlines visible amid the rubble a cemetery for hundreds
of thousands. A few pockmarked buildings and an area on the
right bank of the Vistula alone had escaped the holocaust Apart
from its ruins, nothing remained of Warsaw... except its name.
Warsaw's reconstruction was soon being hotly debated by
town planners and architects. Some had Utopian visions of a
futuristic city. Many saw a unique opportunity to sweep away
the past and the city's former shortcomings and to create an
entirely new Warsaw. But the people of Warsaw had no time
to wait. Swarming over the ruins they began to rebuild the city
themselves.
In time a new city emerged that reflected the beauty of its
historic past while meeting the needs of 20th century life. A
dynamic schooi of town planning was born. Medieval squares
were recreated and 17th century houses rebuilt, but behind their
façades were dwellings with every modern convenience. Palaces
and mansions were restored as cultural and administrative centres.
The Gothic cathedral was rebuilt with its original stones. The
city's new opera house was given the same classical façade as
its predecessor, but behind it is a modern concert and operatic
theatre ranking among the best equipped in Europe. New and
broader bridges now span the Vistula on the piles of those that
were destroyed.
But Warsaw's architects had recourse to a most unusual pro¬
cedure in reconstituting the city's historic buildings: the celebrated
paintings of Warsaw by the 18th century artist Canaletto.
To the people of Poland the name Canaletto evokes Warsaw
not Venice. In 1767, Bernardo Belotto, better known as Canaletto
the Younger (not to be confused with his uncle Antonio Canal the
famous Canaletto of Venice scenes) arrived in Warsaw. He fell
in love with the city and remained there until his death in 1780,
leaving behind him a series of paintings of Poland's capital of
unrivalled fidelity: living street scenes with a wealth of detail of
houses, churches, public buildings and grandiose panoramic views.
Canaletto's paintings have been called "a fascinating full-colour
film of Warsaw's life in the 18th century." He always painted a
building with adjoining ones, with its square or street filled with
people, teams of horses and carriages, and the bustling life of
the city about it.
Warsaw's architects made huge enlargements of the 25 cele¬
brated townscapes by Canaletto in the city's national museum.
They studied and recorded the details painted by Canaletto and,
embodying them into the reconstructed monuments, churches and
buildings, thus restored to Warsaw the true image of its ancient
past.

A,l BOUT a year ago I was in
London at the invitation of British psy¬
chologists and sociologists in order to
lecture on "National Stereotypes."
Throughout the preceding day, during
which I was undoubtedly made more
sensitive by my preoccupation with
this topic, I kept running into exam¬
ples of such stereotyped thinking.
In my hotel, I heard someone say,
"Oh, she has that Scottish stubborn¬
ness, you know". A book review in a
newspaper used the phrase, "With
true Gallic wit". At the theatre that
evening, during the interval, I caught
part of a conversation in which a pretty
girl said to her escort, "I know that all
Americans have a 'line'"; and in a
mystery story that I read before
retiring, there was a reference to "typi¬
cal German thoroughness".
These are all instances of those
"pictures in our heads" to which
Walter Lippman gave the name of ster¬
eotypes. They are typical of the ease
with which most of us generalize about
national or ethnic groups, usually with¬
out even stopping to think where such
"information" comes from, and whether
it represents the truth, the whole truth,
or anything like the truth.
There are certainly very few, if any,
among us who have not succumbed
to the temptation to stereotype nations.
One might almost describe the ten¬
dency as inevitable, or at least very
nearly so. We know that Englishmen
are reserved, and Irishmen pugnacious;
we have heard it all our lives; besides
most people agree with us. But if we
are asked how we know, we would
not easily find a suitable answer.
One of the earliest careful studies of
this tendency was made by Katz and
Braly, in 1932, in connexion with the
stereotypes held by Princeton Univer¬
sity students. Their technique was
simple.
Each student was given a list of
traits, and a list of nationalities; from
the first lisj: he chose the five traits
which he regarded as characteristic of
each national or racial group.
We may summarize the results by
OTTO KLINEBERG Is professor emeritus of
social psychology at Columbia University,
New York, and director of the International
Centre for Intergroup Relations, Paris.

indicating the three or four characteris¬
tics most commonly ascribed to each
nationality. These included, for the
Germans: scientifically-minded, indus¬
trious, stolid; the Italians, impulsive,
artistic, passionate; Negroes, super¬
stitious, lazy, happy-go-lucky, ignorant;
the Irish, pugnacious, quick-tempered,
witty; the English, sportsmanlike, intel¬
ligent, conventional; the Jews, shrewd,
mercenary, industrious; the Americans,
industrious, intelligent, materialistic,
ambitious; the Chinese, superstitious,
sly, conservative; the Japanese, intelli¬
gent, industrious, progressive; the
Turks, cruel, religious, treacherous.
A study conducted in nine countries
under the auspices of Unesco in 1948
and 1949, showed that such stereo¬
typed thinking could easily be elicited
almost anywhere. In each country
approximately 1,000 respondents, re¬
presenting a cross-section of the popu¬
lation, were given a list of 12 traits,
and asked to choose those which they
thought were most applicable to them¬
selves, to Americans, to Russians, and
in some cases, to two or three other
national groups as well. They could
choose as many of the traits as they
wished.
The British, for example, thought of
Americans as primarily progressive,
conceited, generous, peace-loving, in¬
telligent, practical. The Americans re¬
garded the British as intelligent, hard¬
working, brave, peace-loving, conceited
and self-controlled. The Norwegians
described the Russians as hardwork¬
ing, domineering, backward, brave,
cruel and practical.
The "self-image" is also revealing.
The British saw themselves as peace-
loving, brave, hard-working, intelligent;
the French saw themselves as intelli¬
gent, peace-loving, generous, and
brave; the Americans saw themselves
as peace-loving, generous, intelligent
and progressive. All the groups
agreed on one item: their own nation
was the most peace-loving of all!
Few people realize how much the
existence of stereotypes may colour
our relations with other people, even
to the extent of seeing them differently
as a result.
What we see is determined in part ÙH
by what we expect to see. If we be¬
lieve, for example, that Italians are
noisy, we will have a tendency to

PICTURES IN OUR HEADS (Continued)
notice those Italians who are indeed
noisy; if we are in the presence of
some who do not fit the stereotype,
we may not even realize that they, too,
are Italian. If someone points that fact
out to us and says: "Look, those
people are Italians, and they are not
noisy", we can always dismiss them as
exceptions.
Since there is no limit to the number
of cases that can be so dismissed, we
may continue to cling to the pictures in
our heads, in spite of all the facts to
the contrary. This does not always
happen. Stereotypes do sometimes
change in the light of new experience.
If we have had them for a long time,
however, we surrender them with great
reluctance.
Some years ago Allport and Post¬
man, psychologists at Harvard Univer¬
sity (Cambridge, U.S.A.) studied some
of the phenomena associated with the
spread of rumours, making use of a
technique known as ."serial reproduc¬
tion", a very simple device which
anyone can use with a group of friends.
They showed a picture to one stu¬
dent, and he described to a second
student what he saw in the picture.
The second then told a third what the
first had told him ; the third told the
fourth, and so on, through a series of
8 to 10 reproductions. Then a compar¬
ison was made between the final
result and the original presentation.
One of the pictures showed a scene
in a subway in which, in addition to a
number of people seated, there were
two men standing, one a white man,
the other a Negro. The white man
was dressed in working clothes, with
an open razor stuck in his belt. It so
happens that the stereotype of the
Negro held by some people in the
U.S.A. included the notion that Neg¬
roes carry with them an open razor,
of which they make ready use in an
argument.
In half of the groups who served as
subjects in these experiments, before
the end of the series of reproductions
had been reached, the razor had "mov¬
ed" from the white man to the Negro.
In some instances, the Negro was even
represented as brandishing the razor
violently in the face of the white man.
This does not mean that half of the
subjects in the experiment saw the
Negro with the razor, since if only one
person in the chain made this error,
it would be repeated by those that
followed. Interestingly enough, this
did not occur when the subjects were
Negroes (who rejected the stereotype),
or young children (who had not yet
"learned" it).
If a great many people agree that a
particular trait is associated with a
particular nation, does that make it
true? There is a fairly widespread
theory to the effect that "where there's
smoke there's fire". Otherwise, the
argument runs, where does the stereo¬
type come from? How would it come
into existence?
There is, however, a good deal of
evidence that stereotypes may develop
without any kernel of truth whatsoever.
We all know how widespread is the
notion that intelligent people have high
foreheads, yet scientific investigation
in this field has failed to reveal any
such relationship.
The stereotype of the criminal as
bearing in his features the mark of his
criminality is widely accepted, but it is
equally without foundation; the famous
British criminologist, Sir Charles Gor¬
ing, was able to demonstrate that
a composite photograph, representing
criminals in British gaols, bore no
resemblance to the accepted stereo¬
type of the criminal.
Stereotypes frequently change. In
some cases it may be argued that this
corresponds to a real change in the
characteristics of the people; in others,
however, it seems much more likely to
be due to external circumstances
which have little or nothing to do with
the group concerned.
The Dutch sociologist, Den Hollan¬
der, has studied the historical changes
in the stereotype of the Hungarians in
Europe. He points out that for cen¬
turies after the migration of Hungarians
to Central Europe, they had a bad
reputation, and were regarded as cul¬
turally different, and therefore inferior
to Europeans generally. During the
15th and 16th centuries, however, when
they joined in the war against the
Turks, they were pictured as a brave,
devout, and chivalrous people.
By the second half of the 18th cen¬
tury their popularity had again de¬
clined, and they were described as
savage, lazy, egotistical, unreliable,
and tyrannous. This picture changed
again a little later, when the
Hungarians became romanticized and
idealized. Den Hollander believes that
the image followed the pattern of poli¬
tical inter-relationships; it seems unli¬
kely that there was sufficient transfor¬
mation in the character of the people
to justify the change in the national
¡mage.
IHE American sociologist,
La Piere, studied the attitudes of
residents of California towards first
and second generation Armenian im¬
migrants in Fresno County in that
State. There was almost complete
agreement that these Armenians had
more than their share of faults, and the
general attitude toward them was re¬
latively unfriendly.
La Piere proceeded to question non-
Armenians as to the reasons for their
antipathies, and he was able to classify
the answers into three stereotypes. In
the first place, it was stated that
Armenians were treacherous, lying,
deceitful. In actual fact, when measur¬
ed by the criterion of business integ¬
rity, the Armenian merchants turned
out to be equal and frequently superior
to others.
In the second place, they were alle¬
ged to be parasites, making excessive
demands upon charitable organizations,
free clinics, etc. Actually, such de¬
mands by them were less than half of
what would be expected in terms of
their proportion of the population.
Finally, it was said that they had an
inferior code of morality, and they were
always getting into trouble with the
law. In fact, police records showed
that they appeared in only 1.5 per cent
of Police Court cases, although they
were about 6 per cent of the population.
La Piere concludes that all of these
stereotypes have one factor in com¬
mon, viz. that they are definitely false.
This does not mean that stereotypes
never contain any truth. It does mean
that they can develop without any
truth whatsoever.
Stereotyped thinking may be almost
inevitable, but there is good evidence
that it can at least be reduced, if not
eliminated. Eighteen years after the
Katz and Braly study, another psycho¬
logist (Gilbert) applied the same tech¬
nique to a new generation of Princeton
students. He found that there was
some persistence of stereotypes, but
also a very important change which he

'TAKE-OFF'
ON STEREOTYPES
ABOUT INDIA
These drawings are take-offs by an Indian
artist, A. M. Abraham, poking fun at some of
the stereotypes Westerners often have of
Indians and India. The cartoons were spe¬
cially drawn for the 'Unesco Courier' by
Mr Abraham and published in June 1955.
There is much less agreement
among the students in 1950 than in
1932; any specific trait is usually
checked by a much smaller proportion
of students in the later study. In 1932
for example, 84 per cent of the stu¬
dents described the Negroes as lazy;
in 1950 the percentage had dropped
to 31. The description of Italians as
artistic drops from 83 to 28.
In London, a Unesco study conduct¬
ed by H.E.O. James and Coran Teñen,
showed how specific personal
iences might affect the nature and
content of stereotypes. What they did
was to obtain from schoolchildren
their opinions of other ethnic groups,
particularly of African Negroes, and
then bring them into contact with two
able African women teachers who
spent a few weeks in the schools.
The "before and after" picture is
very striking. As an example, a child
before the experience stated that "I
do not like black people; it's the colour;
it makes me nervous; they might be
savage... they are different in nature
from us, more savage and cruel some¬
times, so you don't trust them ever."
The same child after the experience
said: "Miss V. and Miss W. were nice
people... there does not seem any dif¬
ference between them and us except
the colour. I think that Negroes are
like that just like us, except for the
colour. I like them. They are nice
people."
The authors give many examples of
similar changes that occurred. Stereo¬
types cannot always be modified so
strikingly nor so fast, but the fact that
they can be changed at all as a result
of experience is itself encouraging.
Sometimes just growing older helps.
In a study sponsored by Unesco,
Piaget and Weil report the results of a
series of interviews with Swiss children
of different ag*,s. One interview with
a little girl aged eight years ran as
follows:
"Have you heard of foreigners?
Yes, there are Germans and French.
Are there any differences between
these foreigners? Yes, the Ger¬
mans are bad, they are always
making war. The French are poor
and everything is dirty there. Then
I have heard of Russians, but they
are not at all nice. Do you have
any personal knowledge of the
French, Germans or Russians, or
have you read something about
them? No. Then how do you
know? Everyone says so."
On the other hand, a boy aged thir¬
teen years, after having mentioned a
large number of foreign countries of
which he had heard, was asked. "Are
there any differences between all
those countries?", and his answer
was, in part, "you find all types of
people everywhere." We are not all
as "mature" as this 13 year-old boy,
but perhaps we can move in that
direction. Or is it possible that the
Swiss are...? Oh nol No stereotypes!
The understanding of national char¬
acteristics represents an important
task for all of us. The difficulties in
the way are great: nations are made
up of many different kinds of indivi¬
duals, and generalizations are danger¬
ous if they do not give adequate
consideration to the range of individual
variations.
An important first step will be taken
if we treat "the pictures in our heads"
with a strong dose of scepticism, and if
we keep our minds closed to stereo¬
types and open only to facts. No one
is denying the existence of national
characteristics.
A knowledge of them can aid our
understanding of people, as well as our
enjoyment of the varieties of behaviour
and personality that are found in dif¬
ferent parts of the world. We need to _ .
make sure, however, that the "pictures K1
in our heads" correspond as closely as "'
possible to reality.

Few forms of behaviour are more common or more widely
accepted than the urge to improve on nature by adorning the
body, particularly... from the neck up. Not only do we. adorn
ourselves because our cultural conventions require it, but we
do so in strictly regulated ways. And fashion is a capricious
tyrant. What is most desirable and sought after today may be
completely "démodé" tomorrow. Thus bodily decoration takes an
infinite variety of forms. 1. Rattan hat worn by llokano mountain
people of Northern Luzon (Philippines). 2. Hopi Indian (Arizona,
U.S.A.) head-dress worn by unmarried girls. 3. Fur and silk
hat from Mongolia. 4. Iroquois (New York State) man wearing
dyed deer hair roached head-dress, face paint, silver crescent-
shaped earrings and bear-claw necklace. 5. Hat adorned with
feathers worn by Azande from the Congo. 6. New Guinea
man with "upsweep" hair-do, drawn through a basket funnel.
7. Bronze casts of Ife heads (Nigeria) showing entirely different
types of head-dress.

IN THE CENTRE OF THE MAP
by Marshall G. S. Hodgson
54
|N the sixteenth century the
Italian missionary, Matteo Ricci, took
with him to China a European map of
the world showing the new discoveries
in America. The Chinese were glad
to learn about America, but one point
in the map offended them. Since it
split the earth's surface down the
Pacific, China appeared off at the
right-hand edge; whereas the Chinese
thought of themselves as literally the
"Middle Kingdom", which should be
in the centre of the map. Ricci pacifi¬
ed them by drawing another map,
splitting the Atlantic instead, so that
China appeared more central; and
maps are still commonly drawn that
way in that part of the world.
Europeans have clung to the first
type of map, showing Europe in the
upper centre; while the commonest
maps in North America show the
U.S.A. in that post of honour, even at
the cost of splitting a continent in
two. The temptation not only to put
one's own land in the centre of the
map, but one's own people in the
centre of history, seems universal.
The most famous case of this is
indeed that of the "Middle Kingdom".
Many Chinese used to suppose that
the Temple of Heaven at the Emper¬
or's capital, Peking, marked the exact
centre of the earth's surface.
Chinese scholars even in the Middle
Ages were aware that China could not
be said to be mathematically central;
they knew the general lay of Europe
and Africa and the Indian Ocean, and
a writer could remark that the "centre"
of the earth was along the equator.
Nevertheless, even for sober histor¬
ians the pivotal fact of human history
was the condition of the great Chinese
empire, in which was concentrated all
the splendour of polished civilization.
For the medieval Hindu the world
was a place for the purification of
souls. Kings and their empires came
and went, the gods themselves arose
and perished time was infinite, space
immense, with unlimited opportunity for
every soul to reap in birth after rebirth
what it had sown.
As a given cosmic cycle wore on,
disorder increased and justice faded.
Our own age (the Hindus explained)
was in the latter part of such a cycle;
only in the central parts of the earthy
regions in India, that is was society
still well ordered: there Brahmins still
offered sacrifices and the other castes
ruled or served according to their
status.
In the benighted lands to the east
and west so tainted already with
decline that pious Brahmins dared not
set foot there souls were doomed to
be born as barbarous Mlecchas; there
they lived unhallowed lives till they
earned the right to be born in India.
As our degenerate age drew on,
even in India itself the social order
was upset, rulers rose from the basest
castes, and finally even Mlecchas
entered as conquerors Muslims from
the west, and even remote Europeans.
Through all this outward humiliation,
however, the Hindu could know that
there in the central lands where the
sacred Ganges flowed he could still
live the way of truth and holiness
inaccessible to lesser breeds of men
and aspire to the highest degrees of
rebirth.
To the medieval Muslim, Moham¬
med's birthplace, Mecca, was the cen¬
tre of the earth's surface; here was
the very throne of God, where heaven
and earth were nearest.
To be sure, scholars knew that the
earth was a sphere, and God equally
present everywhere in the hearts of
the believers. But their more sober
picture of the world was equally effec¬
tive in supporting the eminence of
Islam. They thought of the inhabited
quarter of the globe as a land mass
lying between the equator and the
North Pole, and between the oceans
to the west and to the east roughly
Eurasia and northern Africa.
T.HIS was divided into sev¬
en "climes" from south to north, and
from extreme heat to cold. Muslims
writing in the latitude of Syria or Iran
explained that in the hot south men
grew lazy and so remained backward
in civilization; and likewise in the far
north where it was too cold in nor¬
thern Europe, for instance men's
skins were pallid and their minds
sluggish.
Hence it was that only in the central,
moderate climes, like the Mediterran¬
ean lands or Iran, were minds most
active and civilization most advanced;
from there the blessings of Islam were
gradually being brought even to the
remotest areas, among the Negroes
in the hot south and the white men in
the cold north.
The West-Europeans of the same age
had many of the same ideas of history
and geography as the Muslims, getting
them from the same Greek and Hebrew
sources; but their interpretation was
very different. For them history was
the story of God's progressive dis¬
pensations of law or of grace to his
favoured people. Out of the descen¬
dants of Adam, God had first chosen
the Hebrews, but with the coming of
Christ it was a "new Israel", the Chris¬
tians, that received His favours.
Even among the Christians God
had made a further selection casting
aside those of the Levant and Greece
as heretics or schismatics, in favour
of the West-Europeans under the Pope
at Rome. The favoured peoples
of each age lived under a succession
of great monarchies: in earlier times
Chaldean, Persian, and Greek, which
all conquered the Hebrews; but last
and greatest, under which Christ Him¬
self was born, the empire of Rome in
the west, which should endure till
Judgment Day.
EST-EUROPEANS allowed
that the centre of the world's sur¬
face was Jerusalem (by exaggerating
the length of the Mediterranean, their
maps could show Spain and China as
equally distant from it); but they assur¬
ed themselves that, just as at the be¬
ginning of history Paradise was in the
east where the sun rises, so in these
latter days the centre of God's vicar-
ship on earth was in the west, where
the sun sets; henceforth Rome was the
centre of all authority, spiritual and
temporal.
With the discovery that Earth is a
tiny planet in an immensity of space,
that mankind has been upon it hun¬
dreds of thousands of years and is
still a newcomer, we have had to
rethink our situation. The great ideals
of faith and of culture have to be
seen in spiritual terms rather than as
reflected in the map of the universe.
The West-Europeans were the first
to be really faced with the new dis¬
coveries and have consequently led
the way toward creating a new picture
of the world. But they have not yet
escaped the temptation to make geo¬
graphy and history centre upon them¬
selves.
One need only examine the table
of contents of any proper Western
"world history". Civilization began in
Mesopotamia and Egypt (with perhaps
some local variants in India and Chi¬
na); but (it would seem) soon history
was almost a monopoly of the Greeks;
and though other peoples might still
be curious, in their quaint ways,
hereafter it was really Europe that

We reproduce here a burlesque
map of the fortifications of Paris
drawn by Mark Twain and published
in the "New York Herald" of Sunday,
October 2, 1870. At this time the
siege of Paris during the Franco-
Prussian war had just begun and
newspapers the world over were filled
with maps of Paris as is Journalistic
practice. Below we publish the text
written by Mark Twain for his map.
August 1957
MARK TWAIN'S MAP OF PARIS
TO THE READER
The above map explains itself.
The idea of this map in not original with me, but is borrowed
from the "Tribune" and the other great métropolitain journals.
I claim no other merit for this production (if I may so call
it) than that it is accurate. The main blemish of the city paper
maps, of which it is an imitation, is that in them more attention
seems paid to artistic picturesqueness than geographical
reliability.
Inasmuch as this is the first time I ever tried to draft and
engrave a map, or attempt anything in the line of art at all,
the commendations the work has received and the admiration
it has excited among the people have been very grateful
to my feelings. And it is touching to reflect that by far the
most enthusiastic of these praises have come from people
who know nothing at all about art.
By an unimportant oversight I have engraved the map so
that it reads wrong-end first except to left-handed people. I
forgot that in order to make it right in print it should be drawn
and engraved upside down. However, let the student who
desires to contemplate the map stand on his head or hold
it before her looking-glass. That will bring it right.
The reader will comprehend at a glance that that piece
of river with the "High Bridge" over it got left out to one
side by reason of a slip of the graving-tool which rendered
it necessary to change the entire course of the River Rhine
or else spoil the map. After having spent two days in digging
and gouging át the map, I would have changed the course
of the Atlantic Ocean before I would have lost so much work.
MARK TWAIN
OFFICIAL COMMENDATIONS
It is the only map of the kind I ever saw. (U.S. Grant)
It places the situation in an entirely new light. (Bismarck)
I cannot look upon it without shedding tears. (Brigham
Young)
My wife was for years afflicted with freckles, and though
everything was done for her relief that could be done, all
was in vain. But, sir, since her first glance at your map, they
have entirely left her. She has nothing but convulsions now.
(J. Smith)
If I had had this map I could have got out of Metz without
any trouble. (Bazaine)
It Is very nice, large print. (Napoleon)
I have seen a great many maps In my time, but none that
this one reminds me of. (Trochu)
It is but fair to say that in some respects it Is a truly
remarkable map. (W.T. Sherman)
I said to my son, Frederic William, "If you could only make
a map like that, I would be perfectly willing to see you die
even anxious." (William III)
counted and after the rise of Rome
only Western Europe; here was the
home of truth and liberty.
If during long centuries it was hard
to find either truth or liberty in
Western Europe, this period was re¬
gretfully labelled the Dark Ages of
mankind; but in modern times the
West-Europeans have duly gone forth
to enlighten (and subdue) the world
so that the history of a henceforth
"Westernized" world may be safely
reduced almost to that of the West
itself.
In European "world atlases" each
European country has its own map,
with the rest of the world In a few
pages at the end. The map ordinarily
selected to show the world as a whole
Is ideally suited to reinforce this way
of seeing mankind.
On the Mercator world map not
only is Europe in the upper centre: it
is represented as a good deal larger
than the other great culture areas.
Most of these lie south of the fortieth
parallel, while Europe is almost wholly
north of it, where Mercator's projection
begins to exaggerate the size of things
enormously.
Accordingly even on the world map,
which ought to provide a sense of
proportion, there is space to name a
great many places in Europe, while in
other populous centres like India or
China, shown on a much smaller scale,
only a few chief places need to be
indicated.
Although equal-area projections of
the world have long been available,
in which shapes as well as sizes are
much less distorted, Westerners
understandably cling to a projection
which so markedly flatters them. They
explain (as if they were engaged in
nothing but sailing) that the true angles
given on the Mercator map are of
convenience to navigators; and in
atlases and wall-maps, in books of
reference and in newspapers, when
Westerners turn to see what the world
looks like as a whole, their precon¬
ceptions are authoritatively gratified.
The story is often told of a small
tribe whose word for "mankind" was
the name for the tribe itself. Other
tribes were merely incidental in their
picture of the world perhaps not
even fully human. Chinese, Hindus,
Muslims, and Westerners alike have
smiled perhaps too quickly at the
rather perilous naïveté of that small
tribe.

THE NEW SCIENCE
OF ART CONSERVATION
by Harold J. Plenderleith
IHE temple, the statue and
the totem pole have to withstand the
action of wind and rain, heat and cold.
Old ships such as the Vasa (raised
from the sea bed in Stockholm har¬
bour); or the Victory (preserved at
Portsmouth, England), provide special
problems concerned with the control of
humidity, prevention from shrinkage
and protection from insect attack.
Mural paintings are normally sheltered
from extremes of temperature but may
be invaded by capillary moisture and
attacked by mould.
Science in our generation is at last
working in the service of monuments
and of museums in co-operation with
the art critic and the archaeologist.
Synthetic materials have been dev¬
eloped that can be used as an impreg¬
nating medium on tempera painting
without imparting any residual shine.
It can also be used to consolidate
pottery from salty deserts whilst the
salts are being washed from it and is
readily removed afterwards if desired.
It is now possible by soft X-rays to
record through a painting the original
crayon sketch made by the artist on
his canvas. Only a few years ago
this would have been regarded as
miraculous. It is also possible to re¬
move a fresco from the wall and leave
behind the mural painter's original
drawing, thus exposing for the art critic
a stimulating new world of interest.
Hundreds of
thousands of rare
books and
manuscripts were
damaged by the
floods that
overwhelmed
Florence, Italy, In
November 1966.
Here, a roomful of
volumes that were
taken apart, washed
page by page and
injected or fumigated
to combat mould,
their worst enemy.
Inestimable damage
was also caused
to countless art
treasures In
Florence during the
flood, which led
Unesco to launch
an International
rescue operation.
In Moscow, certain painted icons
have been found to be built up in a
series of strata on one and the same
wooden panel, and a special technique
has been evolved whereby it is
possible to recover the lower and older
ones without losing those above. Pic¬
tures can be transferred from worm-
eaten panels and mounted on sound
ones, and in other cases rotting can¬
vases are replaced by new ones. In
fact, the most delicate material and
most complex structures can be saved
by the skill of the modern restorer.
In the field of archaeology, the
mechanism of metallic corrosion, a
universal cause of deterioration, is now
well understood and means have been
devised to remove it or, at option, to
arrest its advance without necessarily
destroying the aesthetic character of
the piece.
There is hope that many of the
world's monumental treasures that are
threatened by exposure to atmospheres
polluted by industrial fumes may be
saved objects universally acclaimed
such as the splendid gilt bronze horses
of St Marks, Venice, or the lion and
griffon of Perugia whereas, in the
absence of these recent advances in
the service of conservation, their years
were numbered. The threat will remain,
however, as long as we are content to
breathe air that is polluted with
sulphur compounds. The cumulation
action on metals is as devastating as it
is on the human subjectl
An altogether new field has been
opened up by the physicist in the
application of his methods, of non¬
destructive testing, and these have
already made notable contributions to
the conservation of monuments. An
example that immediately comes to
mind of modern science in action is
the discovery and excavation of an
Etruscan tomb.
First the scientist applies his steth¬
oscope to mother earth. The detec¬
tion equipment of the Lerici Foundation
in Italy, famous for its discoveries of
Etruscan tombs, can be compared
with a stethoscope in sensitivity.
When the scientist detects a discon¬
tinuity beneath the surface he can pin¬
point the centre of a subterranean
chamber and fix his instruments with
such care that on drilling vertically and
inserting a special tubular periscope
with appropriate lighting, he has a

complete view of the interior. All that
has been done to make this possible
is to drill a little hole in the ground
10 cm. in diameter.
That, however, is no more than the
beginning. He has located the tomb.
He now proceeds to insert a small
camera into the tube and he takes a
series of colour photographs, rotating
the camera through 60° between each.
When these photographs are laid out
in orderly succession, there is a com¬
plete record of the paintings that
commonly adorn the walls, of any bas-
reliefs and of grave goods, etc.
Here is the monument disclosed for
study yet without a sod being turned.
A decision has now to be taken and
an important deduction made. Is the
tomb worthy of the time, care and cost,
necessary for its scientific excavation?
If not, it can be sealed and concealed
and we are the richer for the docu¬
mentation that has already been
obtained.
If, however, it is decided to exca¬
vate, the photographs will show how
to go about it for they will disclose
the position of the entrance door: the
location of the entrance passage can
be deduced, and instead of breaking
in through walls or ceiling, as happen¬
ed in previous generations, the exca¬
vation can be so conducted as to
avoid all damage by entering the tomb
from the side by its own passage and

THE WORLD'S GROWING WATER SHORTAGE
OiFUR need for water is constantly increasing. Though
it is difficult to calculate the exact amount, it is safe to say
that in 20 years' time the demand for water will be roughly
double.
Faced with such a situation it is obvious that we should
search as widely as possible and with every available means for
sources of fresh water that seem to be the least costly. But
where do these sources exist? Only a sustained and co-ordinat¬
ed programme of scientific observation and research in hydrology
will tell us the answer. This is the purpose of the International
Hydrological Decade, 1965-1975.
Underground water reserves are much larger those on the sur¬
face, but as they are unseen we tend to underestimate them. It
is vitally important that we make use of these underground
reserves, but never haphazardly. For example, where does the
water come from which we find in one or another of the under¬
ground water-bearing layers ('aquifers')? How does it move? How
is it renewed? And if this water is used, what effect will it have
on the discharge and future level of the water table? What are
the laws of hydrogeology? Despite the immense progress of
recent years, all these questions have still not been fully ans¬
wered.
A similar need for scientific research exists in the branch of
hydrology that deals with the quality of water. In nature, there is
no water like the pure water defined by chemists, made up of
only hydrogen and oxygen. River water, ground-water, and even
rainwater always contain other dissolved or suspended elements,
and these, even when present in small quantities, play an important
rôle.
In the case of irrigation farming, for instance, every drop of
water brings with it a little salt: the water evaporates, but the
salt remains and gradually poisons the soil and plants. In general,
we now know how to remedy this problem of salinity with the
help of leaching and drainage.
But many questions remain unanswered regarding the effect
of irrigation and drainage on the quality of ground-water, and the
possibility of maintaining the ground-water level below the zone
of the plant roots while bringing to the surface the water necessary
for irrigation.
What happens exactly in this thin layer of soil which preserves
the moisture necessary to plant life? What form liquid or
vapourdoes the water take in this zone? What forces act
on the water, depending on the kind of soil present? How long
will this life-giving moisture last?
Evaporation from the soil and transpiration from vegetation are
responsible for the direct return to the atmosphere of more than
half the water which falls on the land. How exactly do these
phenomena, which represent an enormous loss of resources,
occur? What part does a forest play in the water balance-sheet
of a given area? Does it act merely as a water-consuming
mechanism operating through the absorption and transpiration of
the trees thereby reducing the quantity of runoff which reaches
the riversor, on the contrary, does it result in a slow seepage
into the earth which can later be recovered in the form of
ground-water, while at the same time preventing erosion?
These are the kinds of problems which still have to be resolved:
the answers will only be found through a vast programme of
scientific research.
The International Hydrological Decade is such a programme. It
is making possible the global observation of hydrological events
the quantities of rain and snow that fall, the discharge of rivers
and underground reserves and a world-wide stocktaking of our
water resources. It is promoting scientific research in every
branch of hydrology: water run-off, soil moisture, evaporation,
movement of ground-water, the dynamics of lakes, estuaries and
deltas, the evolution of glaciers and the geochemistry of water.
It is a unique co-operative enterprise to provide the scientific
foundations for decisions that governments must take to meet
the world's growing need for water.

EXPLORING THE WORLD'S OCEANS
Man's knowledge of the oceans which cover three-quarters of the earth's
surface is meagre compared to their importance to him. The Indian Ocean, for
instance, is a "weather generator" for many countries of South Asia and a
potentially rich fishing ground. But it was one of the world's least known oceans
until an international expedition (25 countries, 40 ships) co-sponsored by
Unesco and the Special Committee on Oceanic Research studied it intensively
from 1959 to 1965. Today, oceanography is focussed on a systematic
global exploration of the world's oceans. Below left, scientists of a Red Sea

ROUSSEAU, FATHER
OF ANTHROPOLOGY
by Claude Lévi-Strauss
Ri OUSSEAU was more than
just a keen and subtle observer of
peasant life, an impassioned reader of
books on foreign travel, a skilful and
accomplished investigator of exotic
customs and beliefs. Without fear of
contradiction it can be stated that a
full century before anthropology was
actually born he conceived, desired
and foretold it, placing it directly in the
ranks of the natural and human
sciences then in existence.
This prophetic conception, which he
formulated both as a plea and as a
programme of action, appears in a
long footnote to the Discourse on the
Origin of Inequality. "I have difficulty
in comprehending," Rousseau wrote,
"why in an age that prides itself on
learning, two men cannot be found,
one of whom would sacrifice twenty
thousand crowns of his wealth and
the other ten years of his life, to make
a historic journey round the world,
studying not only the inevitable stones
and plants, but for once men and
customs."
And a little further on he exclaims:
"The whole of the world is a weave
of nations of which we know only the
names. And we presume to judge
mankind!
"Imagine a Montesquieu, a Buffon,
a Diderot, a d'Alembert, a Condillac,
or men of that stamp, travelling to
instruct their fellow-countrymen, ob¬
serving or describing as only they
know how, Turkey, Egypt, Barbary, the
empire of Morocco, Guinea, the land
of the Kaffirs, the interior of Africa
and its eastern coast, the Malabars,
the Mogul, the banks of the Ganges,
the kingdoms of Siam, Pegu and Ava,
China, Tartary, and above all Japan;
and in the other hemisphere, Mexico,
Peru, Chile, the Magellan lands, not
forgetting the Patagonias real or imag¬
inary, Tucuman, Paraguay, and if
possible Brazil, the Caribbean, Florida
and all the savage lands. Such a
journey would be of more importance
than all others and would have to be
made with the greatest of care.

on their return from those unforget¬
table travels, were to write at their
leisure a natural, moral and political

world arise from their pens, and we
would learn to know our own..." (Dis¬
course on the Origin of Inequality,
note 10.)
Is this not the very subject matter
as well as the working method of
modern anthropology?
But Rousseau did not just foresee
anthropology, he actually founded it.
Firstly, he did so in practice by writing
the Discourse on the Origin and Foun¬
dations of Inequality Among Men which
posed the question of the relationship
betwen nature and culture, and is per¬
haps the first treatise produced on
general anthropology. Secondly, he
founded the science in theory by
setting down with remarkable clarity
and precision the aims of the anthro¬
pologist as distinguished from those of
the moralist and the historian :
"When one wishes to study men,
one must look close at hand ; but to
study man, one must learn to look
into the distance ; one must first
observe the differences in order to
discern the properties." (Essay on the
Origin of Languages, Chapter VIII.)
This method of approach which
Rousseau assigned to anthropology
marks the birth of the new science and
helps to clarify what at first may appear
to be a double paradox: that Rous¬
seau could at one and the same time
advocate the study of men living in
the most remote corners of the earth,
but in effect devoted most of his
attention to the one man nearest to
him, namely himself; and that in all
his writings his systematic desire for
identification with others went hand in
hand with his total refusal of identi¬
fication with himself.
Now every anthropologist at some
time or other during his life work must
resolve these same two seeming
contradictions which in reality are no
more than the two interchangeable
sides of one coin.
Each time that the anthropologist
goes out into the field he plunges into
a world where everything around him
is strange and often hostile. He finds
himself alone with nothing but his own
person, his subjective self, to help
him survive and carry on his work.
Physically and mentally wracked as
he is by fatigue, hunger and hardship,
by the disruption of his normal habits,
and by the sudden revelation of pre¬
judices which he had never suspected
to exist, his self reveals itself in these
unfamiliar surroundings as it really
is battered and buffeted by all the
shocks and impacts of his personal
life, which not only affected his choice
of a career but would thereafter deeply
mark its entire course.
In the work of anthropology, there¬
fore, the observer uses himself as his
own instrument of observation. As a
result, he must learn to know himself,
to look at himself objectively and at
a distance as if he were another
person. And so the anthropologist
turns to this other person within him,
which is different from his self, in
order to arrive at an evaluation. And
this then becomes an integral part of
all the observations he carries out in
the field on groups and individuals
and the other within them. The prin¬
ciple of "confessions", written or
unacknowledged, is thus basic to the
work of every anthropologist.
For in order to rediscover one's own
image as reflected in others, which is
anthropology's single purpose in study¬
ing man, one should first reject one's
¡mage of oneself.
IT is to Rousseau that we
owe the discovery of this profound
principle and the only one on which
the sciences of man could be founded.
But it remained out of reach and grasp
and incomprehensible so long as the
accepted philosophy was base«! on
Descarte's doctrine of the Cogito
(Cog/to ergo sum) and was fettered
to the alleged logical proof of the ego
upon which the edifice of physics was
constructed though only by renouncing
that of sociology and even biology.
Descartes believed that he could
pass directly from the inferiority of
man to the external world, overlooking
that between these two extremes there
existed societies and civilizations, that
is, worlds made up of men.
Rousseau speaks eloquently of him¬
self in the third person as "he"
(sometimes even splitting this "he" into
two distinct parts as in the Dialogues)
heralding the famous formula "The me
is another" (the anthropologist does
the same thing before proceeding to
show that other people are men like
himself, or in other words, the other
is me).
Rousseau thus emerges as the great
innovator of the concept of uncondi¬
tional objectivity. In his first Promen- m^
ade, he defines his aim as "to study hi
the modifications of my soul and their
sequels", and then adds: "In a sense,
I shall perform upon myself the same

experiments that the physicist carries
out on the atmosphere in order to dis¬
cover its daily condition."
What Rousseau reveals to us (and
though modern psychology and anthro¬
pology have now made it more familiar,
it is nevertheless a most astonishing
revelation) is that there is a third
person "he" that thinks within me, and
at first leads me to doubt that it is
I who am thinking.
To Montaigne's question "What do
I know?" (which started the whole dis¬
cussion) Descartes thought he could
provide the reply with his "I think,
therefore I am." To this Rousseau
retorted with the query "What am I?"
which cannot be answered until an¬
other, more fundamental, question has
been resolved: "Am I?" And the an¬
swer that personal experience has
given is the "he" concept that Rous¬
seau discovered and which he pro¬
ceeded at once to explore with
consummate lucidity...
Now if we are to believe that when
first human societies appeared on earth
man achieved a triple transformation,
passing from a state of nature to cul¬
ture, from sentiment to knowledge, and
from an animal-like state to that of
humanity (which is precisely what
Rousseau set out to prove in his Dis¬
course on Inequality) we can do so
only by attributing to man in his very
earliest primitive condition some vital
faculty or quality which impelled him
to make this threefold transition.
And we must consequently assume
that from the very start this quality
latently possessed both contradictory
elements at least as attributes if not
as intrinsic parts, so that it was at
one and the same time both natural
and cultural, emotional and rational,
animal and human. We must also
assume that the transition could be
made from one to the other providing
this quality became conscious in man's
mind.
This quality, as Rousseau repeatedly
stated, is pity which issues from man's
identification with another not just a
relative or a companion or a com¬
patriot, but with any man because he
is a man; and indeed with any living
creature because it is alive.
Early man thus began by intuitively
feeling himself identical with all his
fellow beings. And he never wholly
forgot this feeling even when the rise
of population forced him to migrate
to new lands and to adapt himself to
new modes of living, and led him to
the awakening of his own identity.
But this awakening came only after
he had slowly learned to recognize
the identity of others and to distinguish
the various animals according to their
species, the human state from the ani¬
mal state, and his own individuality
from the individuality of other men.
The recognition that all men and
animals are feeling beings (which is
what identification signifies) long ante¬
dated man's awareness of their differ
ences: first with regard to the char¬
acteristics common to all living
creatures, and only later to the human
as opposed to non-human attributes.
It is with this bold conclusion that
Rousseau put an end to Descarte's
doctrine of the Cogito.
Rousseau's thought thus evolved
from two principles: identification with
another, even the most removed
"other" of all others including
creatures of the animal world; and the
rejection of identification with oneself,
that is to say the rejection of every¬
thing which might make the self seem
"worthy". These two attitudes are
complementary, the second actually
being the springboard for the first: I
am not "me" but the weakest and
humblest of "others". Herein lies the
true originality of the Confessions.
IHE Rousseauist revolution,
as a forerunner and beginning of the
anthropological revolution, lies in the
repudiation of forced identifications
either of a culture with its own culture,
or of an individual member of a culture
with a public figure or rôle which that
culture seeks to impose upon him.
In both cases the culture and the
individual assert their right to free
identification, and this can only be
achieved beyond man, i.e. with all
living and therefore suffering crea¬
tures; and also before the public figure
or rôle, i.e. with a being as such and
not one already shaped and classified.
In this way the "I" and the "he",
freed from the distinction that only
philosophy has sought to encourage,
are once again united and merged.
With their original unity thus restored
at last, they can forge together the
us against the them, that is, against
society antagonistic and inimical to
man, and which man is the more easily
prepared to reject since Rousseau, by
his own example, has taught him how
to escape the intolerable contradictions
of civilized life.
For though it is true that man has
been expelled by nature and that
society continues to oppress him, he
can at least reverse the extremes of
the dilemma to his own advantage by
seeking the society of nature in order
to meditate on the nature of society.
This, it seems to me, is the lasting
message of the Social Contract, the
Letters on Botany and the Reveries...
But it is today, for all of us who have
come to experience Rousseau's pre¬
diction to his readers of "the terror of
those unfortunates who will live after
you," that his thoughts tower to their
full height and reveal the broad sweep
of their horizons...
In this world more cruel to man
perhaps than it has ever been, charged
with extermination in every form, mas¬
sacre and torture not always dis¬
avowed no doubt but comfortably dis¬
missed by us as no longer important
since they were confined to far-off
people who we were told suffered for
our good or at any rate in our name
in this universe of ours become
smaller, more drawn together as our
members steadily augment and with no
fragment of humanity left safe from
insidious attack the anguish of living
in society weighs on us all.
It is today, I repeat, because he put
civilization on trial, pointing a finger
at its iniquities and abuses and denied
that these could possibly lead to the
exercise of virtue in man, that Rous¬
seau can help us to shatter an illusion
the deadly effects of which we are
now able alas to observe in ourselves
and on ourselves. For is it not because
of the myth of the exclusive dignity
of human nature that nature itself

suffered its first mutilation, followed
inevitably by other mutilations?
Never in the course of the past four
centuries has western man been in a
better position to realize that by
arrogating to himself the right to raise
a wall dividing mankind from the beast
in nature, and appropriating to himself
all the qualities he denied the latter,
he set in motion an infernal cycle.
For this same wall was to be pulled
steadily tighter, serving to set some
men apart from other men and to
justify in the minds of an ever-shrinking
minority their claim to being the only
civilization of men. Such a civilization,
based as it was on the principle and
notion of self-conceit, was corrupt from
the very start.
Only Rousseau raised his voice
against this type of egotism. In the
footnote to the Discourse previously
quoted, Rousseau recounts that, from
the clumsy descriptions made by
travellers, he preferred to recognize
the great apes of Africa and Asia as
men of an unknown race rather than
run the risk of denying human nature
to creatures who might possess it.
For the only hope that each of us
can have that we shall not be treated
one day as beasts by our fellow-men
is for all our fellow-men, we first
amongst them, to look upon ourselves
at once as suffering beings, nurturing
within us that faculty for pity which in
nature replaces "laws, morals and
virtue," and without which, as we are
now coming to realize, there can be no
law, no morals and no virtue in society.
|T may well be that this
teaching was already contained in the
great religions of the Far East. But in
the traditions of the West where, ever
since antiquity, it was thought that
one could play a double game and
tamper with the evidence that man
was a living and a suffering being,
no different from all other beings
before secondary factors distinguish¬
ed him from them, who else but Jean-
Jacques Rousseau has made this mes¬
sage available to us?
"I have a violent aversion," Rous¬
seau wrote in his fourth letter to
Monsieur de Malesherbes, "to social
orders that dominate others. I hate the
Great, I hate their condition." Does
not this assertion apply first to man
who has sought to dominate other
living creatures and maintain a separ¬
ate state, thereby giving the least
honourable of men freedom to do the
same to other men and to take advan¬
tage of a notion as disgraceful in this
latter instance as it was in the earlier
broad context.
In a cultivated society there can be
no excuse for the only really inexpiable
crime of man, that of considering him¬
self abidingly or momentarily superior,
or treating men as objects, be it for
reasons of race, culture, conquest,
or merely expediency.

One of the greatest contributions of the French Revolution to
Europe and to science throughout the entire world was the
introduction of the metric system. The first systematic attempts
at international scientific collaboration date from the introduction
of this system. It was for the purpose of Inaugurating the metric
system that the first international scientific conferences were
held and the first international institutions set up, such as the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, at Sèvres (France),
which has been in operation since 1875.

The appearance of the mass-circulation book is probably the
most important cultural development in the second half of the
20th century. What is involved Is not the adaptation of books
to new conditions but a real revolution. The mass-circulation book
is as different from the classic book as was the printed book
from the manuscript and the manuscript from the clay tablet.
The revolution in books will eventually modify the contents of
books themselves as it is already transforming the relationship
between author and reader.

Much of the undersea landscape hidden from our eyes is
less well-known than the face of the moon that we see. With
minerals resting on it, nutrients sinking towards it, geological
history locked in its sedimentary layers and petroleum beneath
it, the sea's bottom is at least as interesting, and certainly more
immediately useful to man, than the moon's backside. What we
need to do to investigate the sea can be done for a yearly cost
which is a small fraction of what we now spend on space.

CUNEIFORM SCRIPT
BORN FROM THE POINT OF A REED
The Sumerians in Lower Mesopotamia
rank with the Egyptians, the Cretans
and the Chinese as the earliest inventors
of an efficient system of writing. They
took the first step from the pictographic
to the syllabic system and thus helped
to develop writing as we know it today.
About 3000 B.C., the Sumerians made
seals, used as property marks, and then
employed word-signs picturing the object
referred to. These original "pictographs"
were then given phonetic values result¬
ing in a greater descriptive precision.
This was now a "rebus-writing", a
word that was difficult to render picto-
rially being shown by the sign for another
word with the same or similar sound. It
thus became possible to write almost
any combination of spoken words. By
2500 B.C., the writing had evolved into
a few wedge-shaped strokes from which
the name "cuneiform" is taken. It was
written on tablets of damp clay with a
stylus often the sharpened point of a
reed. Babylonians and Assyrians and
later the Hittites and Persians took
over the cuneiform script from the
Sumerians and adapted it to their own
languages. Sometimes an explanatory pic¬
ture was included in the writing to guide
the illiterate. But pictures and script now
had no need of each other. Reading and
writing began to spread throughout
Mesopotamia.
MYSTERY
SCRIPTS
One of the great advances in
archaeological research in
the 19th century was the
decipherment of many an¬
cient languages. Before
1822, not a word could
be read of the hieroglyphic
system of writing of the
Egyptians, one of the earliest
used by man. But that year
the code was cracked, and
now documents covering
three millennia of civiliza¬
tion have become an open
book. The cuneiform scripts
of the Sumerians, Babylo¬
nians and Assyrians were all
deciphered during the 19th
century. Our own century
has seen the decipherment of
two more cuneiform scripts,
(the Ugaritic script of fías
Shamra, Syria, and that of
the Hittites) as well as the
Hittite hieroglyphic script. In
1953 came the decipher¬
ment of Minoan Linear B.
To all these results scholars
in many countries have con¬
tributed, ft is to be hoped
that with the tools of mod¬
ern science, the remaining
"mystery" languages will one
day find their decipherers.

THE UNDECIPHERED
DISC
FROM PHAISTOS
In 1908 an Italian mission working at Hagia Triada, near Phaistos, in Crete, brought
to light a script of which only one example exists. It was inscribed on a flat terra¬
cotta disc about six and a half inches in diameter (left) which was found in an
outbuilding of the Minoan Palace. Next to it was a broken tablet Inscribed with the
Cretan Linear A script that has been dated to about 1700 B.C.
On either side of the terra-cotta disc is a text impressed with a hitherto unknown
form of hieroglyphics arranged in bands spiralling to (or from) the centre. The signs,
which seem to have been stamped by means of 45 different wooden and metal
punches, number 241 in all and are divided into 61 groups of characters (which
might represent words or sentences) separated by vertical lines. The script Is
considered to be a syllabic one: there are too few characters for a pictographic
script and too many for an alphabetic one.
Archaeologists and classical scholars have been trying, right from the start, to
decode this script on the basis of internal evidence.
The main difficulty is that no-one knows what language the text was written In it
has been variously adjudged to be Philistine, Lycian, Carian, Greek, Cypriote, Libyan,
Anatolian and Semiticor even whether it was written from right to left, or the
reverse. J. Chadwick, of Cambridge University, the collaborator of Michael Ventris
in the decipherment of Minoan Linear B, took the latter view. He drew particular
attention to the use of punches, and described it as a remarkable anticipation of
the invention of engraving and printing. It was hard to believe, as he pointed out,
that the preparation of the set of 45 punches would have been undertaken solely
for the production of one disc. Thus, companion pieces may one day be found.
Some examples of the results achieved by would be decipherers give an idea of
the hazards involved. An English investigator, in 1931, took the language to be
Greek, ascribing to each character a syllabic value. Thus one five-character group
was translated as "Arise, Saviour! Listen, Goddess, Rheall" A Greek scholar favoured
Semitic, and produced a partial "rendering" in 1948: "Supreme - deity, of the powerful
thrones star; Supreme - tenderness of the consolatory words; Supreme - donator of the
prophecies; Supreme - of the eggs the white..."

THE REDISCOVERY
OF AFRICA
66
I S the Negro a man without
a past? Not many years have passed
since the outside world took an
affirmative answer more or less for
granted.
But now, in the wake of the colonial
hurricane, there emerges a new
approach to the whole question. It is
increasingly realized that the cultural
contributions of African peoples to the
general history and progress of man¬
kind were not limited to interesting
works of art, whether in wood or ivory
or in bronze or gold, but compre¬
hended a wide range of political and
social achievements that were no less
important or remarkable because they
were ignored or little known.
It is seen, indeed, that these works
of art that so many Asians and Amer¬
icans and Europeans have admired
were not the more or less mysterious
products of a social vacuum, but, on
the contrary, the ornament and attri¬
bute of early African civilizations.
These middle years of the 20th
century may be remembered for many
troubles and upheavals, and for risks
and dangers greater than any that
humanity had ever run before: on the
side of good they will also be remem¬
bered as the central years of African
emancipation. And they mean, of
course, much more than a purely
political emancipation; they mean, as
well, an intellectual and moral eman¬
cipation, a breaking down of obstacles
that have stood between Africans and
a sense of full equality with the rest
of the world, and of barriers that have
helped to isolate these African peoples
from the general family of man.
Homo sapiens may first have seen
the light in central or east Africa. For
some thirty years now, Africa has
yielded discovery after discovery
revolutionizing earlier concepts of the
remote origins of humanity.
What now becomes possible is to
sketch the outline of the comparatively
recent pre-history and history of large
regions of Africa: the record, that is,
of the pre-medieval and medieval
centuries that came immediately before
European contact and penetration.
It is this that is really new this
assertion that Africans went through
successive, distinctive, and knowable
phases of growth and development in
BASIL DAVIDSON, British author and jour¬
nalist, has written widely on African affairs.
the fifteen or twenty centuries before
the European records of Africa became
frequent and various. Reassessment
of the African past, in the sense that I
have spoken of, is essentially the
unravelling and writing of the history
of the African Metal Age In the lands
that lie to the south of the Sahara
desert.
Late Stone Age peoples on the
lower reaches of the Nile, and in
nearby regions that were much more
fertile then, thrust their way into
history in about 3000 B.C., when the
"first dynasty" of the Pharoahs took
power in the delta of the Nile. This
great forward step in northernmost
Africa, interwoven with the comparable
achievements of peoples in the Near
East and the Mediterranean, acted and
reacted as the centuries went by on
lands to the south and west.
Its influence spread southward up
the Nile and there, reacting on the
peoples that it found, stimulated and
helped to create the civilization of
Kush of that renowned kingdom of
Napate and Meroe whose kings and
queens would rule in more or less
continuous succession for a thousand
years after about 800 B.C.
Its influence also spread westward
along the southern shores of the Medi¬
terranean: Phoenician Carthage, found¬
ed in the ninth century B.C., helped
to stimulate and create the Libyco-
Berber civilizations of northern Africa.
And, thirdly, these ancient civilizations
of the Near East and of Egypt pro¬
duced in the southernmost tip of
Arabia that Arabia of the Queen of
Sheba whom Solomon knew and loved
another region of high civilization;
and from southern Arabia this civiliz¬
ation of antiquity despatched its
settlers and traders and warriors
across the Red Sea into the Horn of
Africa, and its mariners and colonists
down the long east coast of Africa.
These pioneers and their mastery
of metal-working and of other material
techniques did not move into a void.
They moved into a land that was
peopled then, if thinly, by several
branches of the human family to which
anthropologists have awarded the
names of Bushman, Negrillo, Hottentot,
Negro, and Hamite.
Now the origins of these peoples of
continental Africa are obscure and
confused. They too, apparently, had
moved southward across the continent,
coming perhaps from outside it, In
centuries beyond calculation.
Perhaps the Hottentots the natives
whom the first Dutch settlers would
find at the Cape of Good Hope in
1652 arrived some time after about
5000 B.C.but nothing of this is
clearly known the peoples whom we
know as Negro and Hamite began to
emerge, multiply, and follow the earlier
migrants in a generally southward
direction.
As they wandered across the con¬
tinent these later peoples, often
mingling with earlier peoples whom
they found, worked out new ways of
living. They invented tropical agri¬
culture. They began to settle and
raise new crops. They learned how
to smelt natural copper and make
primitive tools and weapons of this
metal.
AIT a time that was shortly
before or after the beginning of the
Christian era these peoples of the sou¬
thern continent began to mine and
smelt iron, and to make more efficient
tools and weapons; and with this they
acquired a new and, as it would prove,
revolutionary control over the material
environment in which they lived. It is
from about this time from about
2,000 years ago that the peoples of
the continental heart of Africa begin
to multiply and form their present
major groupings.
It is from then, as it seems, that the
largest of all of Africa's existing human
groups begins to spread into and
populate the empty or near-empty
forests and savannahs. This group
is called the Bantu; but the term has
little or no racial significance, being a
linguistic term for all these many
peoples who speak a closely related
language.
Racially the Bantu are the product
of intermingling over long periods of
time between Negro and Hamite and
Bushman and Hottentot. Physically,
therefore, they vary greatly among
themselves; but all their languages go
back, more or less obviously, to a
common root. We do not know the
origins of this root.
Thus it is the last 2,000 years, more
or less, that emerge as the formative
period of most of the peoples of conti¬
nental Africa. This is the period of
their Iron Age. Some authorities
prefer to call this their Metal or Pal-
aeometallic Age, because, although

the decisive influence, African peoples
also knew the working of several
other minerals, including gold and
copper and tin. In time, too, some
of them worked extensively in brass
and bronze; but they never knew, as
ancient Asia and Europe had known,
a Bronze Age that made a long dis¬
tinctive period of development before
their Iron Age.
Now it is in studying this Metal Age
or, more narrowly, the fifteen or
sixteen centuries before European
contact along the coast that present
research is principally and dramatically
engaged. Advancing along three dif¬
ferent but related lines, history and
archaeology and anthropology now
begin to bring their findings together
and to offer a coherent picture that
was invisible only a handful of years
ago.
New translations are being projected
or prepared of several classic works,
such as the first century A.D. Periplus
of the Erythraean Sea (in Britain) and
the 16th century writings on the
Western Sudan of Leo Africanus (in
France). The Central African Ar¬
chives (of the Federation of Central
Africa) is collaborating with Arquivo
Histórico de Mozambique in the editing
and publication of some 15,000 hitherto
unpublished documents from the librar¬
ies of Goa, Lisbon, and the Vatican;
and these should throw much new light
on early European contacts.
Joseph Needham, in his monumental
study of the history of science in
China, has meanwhile devoted part of
his sixth volume to Chinese maritime
technology, and, in so doing, has
shown how great was the Chinese
contribution to that Indian Ocean trade
which had its western terminals on the
East African coast.
|N the past few years,
African archaeology has had Important
successes. Mauny and Thomassey
have gone far towards completing the
excavation of the ancient city of Kumbi
Saleh, probable site of the capital of
medieval Ghana. J. P. Lebeuf and An¬
nie Masson-Detourbet have uncovered
the remarkable bronze-using civiliza¬
tion of the Sao people of early medie¬
val Chad. Jean Vercoutter, in the Su¬
dan, has completed a preliminary list
of sites of the imposing civilization of
Kush. Other French specialists have
continued the investigation of early
Ethiopia.
In East Africa, Gevase Mathew and
G.S.P. Freeman-Grenville have listed
ancient and medieval sites on the
coast of Kenya and Tanzania, while
J.S. Kirkman has excavated the late
medieval ruins of Gedi, near the
Kenyan port of Malindi. Further to
the north, in Somaliland, Enrico Cerulli
and Vinigi Grottanelli have thrown
important light on early settlements
and migrations on the coast and coast¬
al islands.
Coins and durable imports such as
china offer hopeful means of dating
these many stone ruins of the coast
and interior. "I have never in my
life," remarked Sir Mortimer Wheeler,
the British archaeologist, after a fort
night's visit to Tanganyika in 1955,
"seen so much broken china as
I have seen in the past fortnight
along the coast here and the Kilwa
Islands: literally, fragments of Chinese
porcelain by the shovelful... In fact, I
think it is fair to say that as far as the
Middle Ages are concerned, from the
tenth century onwards, the burled
history of Tanganyika is written in
Chinese porcelain."
To the southward there is fresh effort
at uncovering the story of another
great complex of stone ruins forts and
huts and vast hillside terrace systems
that stretch over several thousands
of square miles in Southern Rhodesia
and neighbouring lands. Roger Sum¬
mers has lately completed an initial
survey of the stone ruins of Inyanga on
the Rhodesian-Mozambique border;
and now, with Keith R. Robinson, is
working on the foundations of the great
walls at Zimbabwe in the hope of find¬
ing out whether those tall ruins were
built on the site of a previous and more
humble culture, or whether the first
settlers were also those who built so
well In stone.
We are only at the beginning of this
search for the history of pre-medieval
and medieval Africa. Beyond the
barriers of ignorance we may glimpse
an historical landscape that is thick
with cities or strong stone settlements
and loud with the din of ports and
ocean-going shipping, that glitters with
old armies and the pomp of states and
empires and is restless with the rise
and fall of dynasties and powers. But
at present we can only glimpse at this.
This great task of unravelling the
African past remains, and must remain,
an international endeavour. Occa¬
sional conferences on African pre-his-
tory and history have proved, over the
past few years, how much can be
gained from the pooling of knowledge
and the wide discussion of problems.
They have stimulated public interest,
and helped to create an atmosphere
that is favourable to more intensive
research. It is to be hoped that they
are only the forerunners of many
others of their kind. To this end,
indeed, Unesco can powerfully con¬
tribute.

MASTER-WORKS OF
STONE AGE JAPAN
Archaeological excavations in Japan
have uncovered two remarkable
types of ancient clay sculptured
figures. The oldest are the "Dogu"
clay images which date from as far
back as 3000 B.C. They have
squat bodies, flattened heads and
vigorous expressions and may have
been used as a kind of family icon
by Japan's Stone Age hunters and
fishermen. More recent are the
"Haniwa" terra-cotta figurines
produced from the third to sixth
centuries A.D. They were placed In
circles on the slopes of burial
mounds, hence their name (Hani=
clay, wa = circle). When made for
the tombs of men of rank, the
Haniwa were often mass produced,
most of them being cylinders to
surround the burial mound.
Hundreds and sometimes thousands
were needed and were made
rapidly by clay workers normally
engaged in making earthenware
vessels. The Dogu and Haniwa
figures have a remarkable vigour
and freshness.

THE FORBIDDEN DIALOGUE
T,J HE profoundest, most com¬
pelling impulses of South African
society have always been, and still
are, toward amalgamation. This is
perhaps the fact least frequently noted
about South Africa even by those most
opposed to the doctrine of apartheid;
but it is a fact which I think ought to
be set down straightaway not only
because it is true and evidence can be
adduced to support it, but because a
great deal of the legislative programme
of the Nationalist Party Government
since 1949 cannot be properly under¬
stood without taking this fact into
account.
It has also become fashionable in
writing about South Africa to empha¬
size the incompatibility of black and
white interests; yet left to their own
devices the races have always tended
to move closer, albeit unconsciously,
toward . some form of integration.
Surely the most glaring proof of this
fact lies in the economic sphere; but
less obvious is a similar impulse at
work in the social sphere, which,
however denied and deeply buried,
continues to reaffirm itself and to agi¬
tate toward complete expression.
That the blacks suffer untold hard¬
ships as a price for the maintenance
of the policy of apartheid is a fact
that cannot be denied even by the
proponents of apartheid.
What is not always noted is that,
though economically exploitative as
a ruling class, the whites are also
subject to certain very real deprivations
as a result of their determination to
live by a policy which would seem
to all reasonable men not only unrealis¬
tic but insane.
To say the very least, South African
whites are the most culturally deprived
community in Africa. Emotionally they
are just as stunted.
They not only grow up denying their
innermost dreams, they also learn to
do without some of the best works of
modern world culture (in literature,
music, painting and intellectual
discourse) either because such works
are considered subversive, or because
traffic in culture with the outside world
is rendered almost impossible by the
maintenance of the policy of apartheid.
It must be remembered that a great
number of people active in the cultural
area are either non-white or white
people strongly opposed to a doctrine
of apartheid. Thus the white commu¬
nity in South Africa is becoming almost
as isolated in its privileged position as
are the blacks without privileges; for
LEWIS NKOSI of South Africa was exiled
by the South African Government in 1960.
He is now consulting editor of "The New
African", published in London.
not only must the blacks not see Harry
Belafonte with a white girl in his arms
in "Island in the Sun" but the whites
must not see Tony Curtis chained to
Sidney Poitier in the film, "The Defiant
Ones".
Indeed, a great number of mod¬
ern works of the best kind in the
post-war cinema are kept out of the
Republic of South Africa. The banning
of books and plays thought to be con¬
troversial is too well-known to need
reiteration. Under these circumstances
it would be surprising if the growth of
an indigenous South African culture
was not hampered and it would be
surprising indeed if the fostering of
standards on a par with the rest of the
world was not made almost impossible.
It seems to me that both black
and white writers are severely impo¬
verished by the limitations as well as
the schism existing in South African
national life.
For a black writer too much of his
emotional response is absorbed into
formulating his attitude toward apart¬
heid or finding his place in the revo¬
lutionary struggle; no matter where he
goes later on and no matter how bored
he is with politics he cannot be free
of the tragic burden of South Africa
until that country has freed its
14,000,000 non-whites.
It seems to me that the
blacks in South Africa, no matter how
deprived economically or politically,
have a graver, far more responsible
attitude toward life. Where white
South Africans must manufacture
dreams and fantasies in order to
maintain some equilibrium between
what they really are and what they
think they are, the blacks have to
learn quite early to strip themselves
of every illusion.
We all know what happens to people
who cannot face up to the reality of
their lives, who must live by evasions
and fantasies; a greater burden is
placed on writers or any other kind of
artist who belongs to such a commun¬
ity. Before they go on to create
anything of value they must make an
extraordinary effort to unlearn every¬
thing they have been taught.
In South Africa, they must, for
instance unlearn what they are taught
in schools: that the whites, from their
forefathers to the present generation,
are all heroes, that the whites have the
monopoly on moral wisdom and intel¬
lectual enterprise; the pain and the
anguish which attends the creative
efforts of Afrikaans writers at the mo¬
ment is not a matter for cynical amuse¬
ment. It is an agony of creative artists
who must break through a sealed
by Lewis Nkosi
cocoon in order to see the world in its
variousness or even to say something
remotely relevant to their country.
Black writers do not have to make
any comparable moral choice; they do
not have to choose to oppose a system
which is patently contrary to all ob¬
servable reality; their colour makes the
choice for them; what they have to do
is learn to survive the system.
There are times when an affirmation
of certain traditional African values
proves exasperatingly difficult for
black writers since most of them are
reacting to an ideology which asserts
again and again that black and white
people are irreconcilably different;
that the African mind cannot grasp
certain nuances of European thought;
and, concluding . from the foregoing,
that apartheid is justifiable, indeed,
the only realistic policy to follow.
The result has been that black
intellectuals in South Africa have had
to bend over backwards to prove that
they can not only master the modes
of European thought but that they can
beat the South African whites at their
own game.
Urban African music seems to me
to have provided the only example of
what South Africa can offer culturally
if she were left to develop in a natural
direction.
Music, because it is non-literal, is
not subject to the same limitations as
literature; it is hardly banned; also it
is less self-conscious in the modes
it adopts to express the agony of the
South African situation. The result
has been that popular urban African
music has provided a glaring paradigm
of what is happening to the under¬
ground life of the nation.
The music is predominantly African,
which is as it should be, considering
the dominant numbers of Africans in
the country; but it is also eclectic; it
provides a moving illustration of cultur¬
al diffusion in that part of the
continent which offers us the best
laboratory for the marriage of African
and European techniques and for the
coming together of European and Afri¬
can modes of expression.
While black literature from the
Republic offers us glimpses into an
appalling situation of rare brutality and
anguish, the music not only shows
us this but goes further to affirm what
we should have known all along; that
the oppressed in South Africa also
display an amazing form of resilience,
emotional certitude and optimism. On
the other hand, apartheid deprives AQ
white South Africans of any real parti- Qjy
cipation in such robust forms of cultu¬
ral expression.

Deprived of water, a camel can lose 100 kilogrammes in 8 days, but regains
the weight by drinking 100 litres in 10 minutes.

L
THE CAMEL, FACTS AND FABLES
EGEND has it that the camel can cross the most
scorching desert without water or food. Until recently, many
common questions could not be answered by science, such as:
How long can a camel go without water? Does the camel store
water in its body? What is the function of the camel's hump?
It was therefore natural that Unesco, among other institutions,
supported an expedition to find answers to many of these
problems. Our field studies were carried out in the Algerian
Sahara, at Beni Abbes, in 1953-54.
How long a camel can live without drinking water depends
on external conditions: amount of food eaten and its water con¬
tent, the load the camel carries, how far it travels, temperature,
and also the breed of the camel and its condition. One therefore
cannot say that any camel can do without water for a certain
number of days.
We soon found that camels grazing in winter were usually not
watered at all. If it rains the desert vegetation contains a good
deal of water. We examined a number of such camels. After
being without water for one of two months they showed no interest
in water whatsoever.
However, in dry winters the camels would undoubtedly have to
be watered. To find out how much water a camel needs we
fed them dry hay and dry dates for periods of up to 16 days in
January. After this, they were rather thirsty but in no serious
condition. Each camel lost weight corresponding to the amount
of water used up. After 16 days it drank an amount corresponding
to the expenditure, bringing the body weight back to normal.
In summer we kept a camel without water for eight days and
it lost 100 kg. When allowed to drink it consumed 103 litres
of water in 10 minutes. Another camel was without water for
17 days. Both animals lost their appetite, looked thin and
emaciated, the muscles were shrunken and the legs scrawny. They
would not have been fit for heavy work or long distance travel.
These two camels were exposed to the hot desert wind and
sun but they had not worked. Judging from this experiment,
even the best camels could not be used for desert travel without
water beyond a week in summer.
Many travellers have suggested that the water tolerance of
the camel is explained by a storage of water in the stomach or
other parts of the body. We observed no instance in which
a camel drank an excess of water that could be regarded as
storage. The belief comes from the fact that the camel has
a stomach divided into several compartments, the largest of
which is the rumen containing the coarsely masticated fodder.
The camel's rumen contains large quantities of fluid but so do
all ruminants. We analyzed this fluid and found that although
it is rather unappetizing it could very well be used for drinking
in an emergency. Thus the tale of the Arab who saves his life
by killing his camel to drink the water in its stomach may be
true. The mistake is in implying that the fluid is stored water.
Some people have stated that the camel's hump contains
the camel's water reservoir. But the hump is almost exclusively
fat and is an energy storage as it is in other animals. Although
the hump does not contain water, there is a grain of truth in
the belief that the camel gets water from the hump. Whenever
organic material is burned water is formed in the process.
When man is exposed to the hot desert he avoids a rise in
body temperature by sweating. The camel also regulates its
temperature by sweating but can vary this temperature and save
on the amount of water needed to keep cool. It allows its body
temperature to rise slowly until almost 41 C. without losing much
water. During the cool night it gives off heat so that its morning
temperature may be as low as 34 C.
The camel can tolerate losing as much as 30 per cent of its
body weight during water deprivation in the hot desert. A camel
that has lost 50 litres of water (20 per cent weight loss) reduces
its blood volume less than one litre. The rest of the water
comes from the tissues and tissue fluids. This places the camel
in a much better position than other mammals in which thick¬
ening of the blood is the main cause of explosive heat death.

THE
ROYAL
HIGHWAY
OF THE
INCAS
Indians leading llama caravans laden with gold along the great Inca Highway
in the Andes. An engraving made shortly after the Spanish conquest.
by
Jorge Carrera Andrade
IHERE are many paradoxes
in history, and one of the strangest
is surely that the Incas, who had never
heard of the wheel, should have built
the greatest road system the world
has known. Their network of high¬
ways covered some 10,000 miles,
stretching from Colombia all the way to
Chile and from the shores of the Pacific
to jungle forests of the Amazon, criss¬
crossing almost all the territory now
included in the Republics of Ecuador
and Peru, as well as portions of Bolivia,
Chile, northern Argentina and southern
Colombia.
The Inca Empire began as a tiny
kingdom on the shores of Lake Titicaca
about the year 1,000 A.D. For five
hundred years it grew and expanded
until, after conquering the Kingdom of
Ouito, it was the most powerful civi¬
lization of South America and adopted
the name "Land of the Four 0uarters
of the World" (Tahuantinsuyu) to
signify its control of the four cardinal
points of the compass.
JORGE CARRERA ANDRADE of Ecuador is a
leading poet and author of Latin America.
The Inca road system was built to
preserve the unity and safeguard the
economic life of the Empire. Its con¬
struction is one of the wonders of
human history, defying all natural
obstacles in one of the most rugged
terrains existing anywhere in the world.
Though far less known than the cele¬
brated roads of Rome and other
ancient empires, the Inca highways are
in many ways even more remarkable.
The backbone of the network was a
broad highway the "Great Royal Road
of the Incas" running the entire length
of the Inca Empire from north to south,
between the two branches of the for¬
midable Andean mountain range. In
certain places the road rose sharply
to as much as 15,000 feet; in others it
dropped steeply in mountain valleys
and gorges, traversed broad fertile
plains and bleak stretches of desert
wasteland.
From the main highway branch roads
cut through the mountains in all direc¬
tions, especially to the west, where
they linked up with another mighty
highway known as the "Coastal Road",
which ran parallel to the Great Royal
Road along the sandy coastal plains
and forests from Tumbez to the north
of Chile where it joined up with it.
It should not be imagined that the
Inca roads were mere mountain tracks
or desert trails. The Great Royal
Highway was 25 feet in width and ran
straight as an arrow, without curves or
detours of any kind, for 3,000 miles
more than the distance between
Gibraltar and Moscow! Paved with
stones along almost its entire length,
it traversed only the principal cities of
the empire, like Cuzco and 0u¡to, the
other towns being linked up with the
Royal Highway by secondary roads.
On both sides of the highway the
Incas built walls of stone and packed
earth on top of which they planted
agave cactuses at regular intervals. In
addition rows of trees lined the road to
provide shade for travellers. Living in
a bleak landscape the Incas attached
great importance to their trees and the
empire enacted stringent laws for their
preservation. The penalty for cutting
them down was death.
A,ILONG the side of the
Great Royal Road ran a rivulet of fresh
water to quench the thirst of both
wayfarers and draft animals. At
intervals of about twelve miles along
the entire stretch of 3,000 miles there
were wayside houses known as tampus
where travellers could rest or spend
the night. There were also chains of
granaries and royal depots stocked
with food and all kinds of supplies for
the army, including clothing and leather
footwear. Grain and manufactured
products were stored in huge earthen
jars. Strangers were accommodated
with the utmost hospitality in hostelries
called corpahuasis and were provided
with food and drink free of charge.
Every mile or so along the Royal
Route the Incas built edifices for a
special category of imperial function¬
aries, the chasquis or relay couriers,
who raced on foot from one end of
the kingdom to the other bearing royal
messages by word of mouth. Some¬
times messages were conveyed by
specially painted sticks or beans m^
painted in various colour combinations j j
which had specific meanings. The
Incas resorted to these devices since
they had no written language.

INCA HIGHWAY (Continued)
72
This postal service was so efficient
that it covered the 3,000 odd miles of
the Great Royal Highway in a matter
of 20 days or sofour times faster
than the "pony express" service intro¬
duced by the Spaniards after the
Conquest. In the best season of the
year, the Chasquis covered the dis¬
tance between Cuzco and Ou¡to in five
days a feat they continued to perform
clandestinely during the Colonial era
to the amazement of the Spaniards
who dubbed this fleet-footed news-
transmission system "post office of the
sorcerers."
The astounding network of Andean
roads and highways was the achieve¬
ment of three Inca emperors: Pacha-
cutec, Tupac Yupanqui and Huayna
Cápac, the manpower for the con¬
struction work coming from the tribes
of peoples they subdued.
Pachacútec, know as the "Reformer,"
was particularly fond of stone and for
the Royal Highway he had enormous
blocks of stone tranported hundreds of
miles, particularly from the Kingdom of
Quito, using the Indians of that region
and a tribe called the Chancas.
The treatment meted out by the
imperial guards (they were called Big-
Ears) was such that the Indians finally
revolted and almost overthrew the Inca
kingdom. The earliest chroniclers
relate how the huge stones (some
weighing 10 tons) were carried such
great distances and tell a story of how
one such block fell and crushed a
thousand Indians to death. It passed
into legend as "the stone that wept
blood."
Fifty years after the Conquest, a
Spanish missionary, José de Acosta,
visited the New World and noted that
the Indians who worked on the roads
-" used no mortar, had neither iron nor
steel for cutting and working the
stones, no machines or instruments for
transporting them, yet so skilful was
their work that the joints between the
stones were barely noticeable."
Tupac Yupanqui was the son of Pa¬
chacútec and carried on his father's
work. He extended the Royal Highway
as far as Chile In the south and beyond
Quito in the north, thus opening up new
territories for trade and development.
To consolidate the empire he built a
chain of fortresses near the Great
Highway, and instituted a system of
"population transfers," shifting newly
conquered tribes to Peru and replacing
them by loyal subjects.
Huayna Cápac, his successor, sur¬
passed his father in the field of public
works. He built Temples of the Sun
and Inca Watchtowers along the Royal
Highway. He repaired the old roads
and built new ones, and had platforms
and terraces made to prevent erosion
of the soil.
But above all, Huayna Cápac was
responsible for the repair, strength¬
ening and consolidation of the suspen¬
sion bridges. These bridges are one
of the greatest feats of the Inca road
network. They appear frail and deli
cate but proved astonishingly resistant.
Flung across raging torrents and formi¬
dable mountain chasms, they were
made of six-inch fibre and bamboo
cables anchored into stone piers, and
were covered with a floor of wooden
laths solidly lashed together to resist
the wind and other ravages of the
elements.
Alexander von Humboldt was one of
the many explorers who gazed in awe
and amazement at the Inca suspension
bridges. His description of one of
them the Bridge of San Luis Rey
was the source of inspiration for novels
by Thornton Wilder and Prosper Méri¬
mée. Humboldt considered the whole
Inca road system far superior to that
built by the Romans in Italy, France
and Spain, and pronounced them "the
most stupendous and useful works ever
executed by man."
But the Incas" passion for roads went
much further than building and engin¬
eering. They also set up a smooth
running system of road maintenance.
A "Royal Commissioner of Inca Roads
and Bridges" supervised a staff of road
inspectors whose duty it was to tour
the realm and check on road conditions
and on the toll-gate keepers controlling
the heavy traffic of Warna trains laden
with produce.
Large crews of yanakonas were
always on hand to sweep and clean
the paved highways with brooms made
of vegetable fibre. Yvar Lissner did
not exaggerate when he said (in his
book How Our Ancestors Lived) that
at the time when the roads of Europe
were no more than muddy, pot-holed
ditches, the Incas had the finest
highways anywhere in the world.
cIAPTAIN Pedro Cieza de
Leon, writing between 1533 and 1545,
was the first European to give a
detailed description of the Inca roads
"which surpass those of the Romans
as well as the road Hannibal built over
the Alps."
As they penetrated the land of the
Incas, the Conquistadores stared at the
scene they saw with incredulous
amazement: down the wide, spacious
highway came groups of Indians
carrying hammocks or litters contain¬
ing personages of note. Other Indians
drove trains of llamas laden with sacks
of coca leaves or ears of corn. The
very sight of these animals half ewe,
half ass left the Spaniards open-
mouthed.
It soon became clear to them why
the roads were in such excellent condi¬
tion: the only traffic on its paved
surface consisted of sandal-shod
pedestrians and gentle-footed llamas.
Later, when the Conquistadores landed
horses in the country (the Incas had
never seen any before) their iron-shod
hooves and the wheels of the .heavy
oxcarts were to cause havoc to the
Llama Road and irreparably damage
the Great Royal Highway of the Incas.
THE SIGNS OF STEINBERG
Their conquest completed, however,
the Spaniards realized the advantages
of the Inca road system and tried to
preserve it by following the Indian
example, at least in part. They adopted
the llama caravans for carting off the
gold they collected either as booty or
tribute or which they extracted from the
mines.
The Inca road system was thus not
only an artery of blood but also of the
gold of South America which went to
raise the standard of life of Europe and
to add splendour to the Renaissance.
The Royal Highway of the Incas,
which cannot be dissociated from the
llama, the postal network, the granaries
and roadside inns, was in fact the
direct instrument in the economic
expansion of the Inca State (Inca
society vested the entire wealth of the
soil and sub-soil in the State and there
was no private ownership of land).

<![CDATA[
As a result of the later neglect of the
Spaniards, the inefficiency of Colonial
organization, the ravages of time and
above all, the excesses of the enco¬
menderos (settlers) who used the Inca
roads as a quarry for the stone they
sought for their building, the whole
highway network finally disintegrated.
Nevertheless, traces of this unparallel¬
ed feat of engineering still remain
today.
The Azuay region of Ecuador pro¬
vides proof of the amazing solidity of
the Inca Highway and of the skill with
which the stones were fitted together.
Despite the passing of centuries, and
notwithstanding the continual, torrential
rains prevalent in the area, water has
not succeeded in filtering through the
joints between the stones. Instead, the
water has hollowed out a channel
beneath the stones and flows away
like a river under the arches of a bridge.
Further evidence of the Incas' skill,
foresight and practical turn of mind is
seen in their secondary roads which
served as supply lines for the products
vital to the kingdom. Thus Huayna
Cápac built a road from Quito to the
Coca valley in the eastern slopes of the
Andes for the transport of the prized
coca leaves; another road knifed
throught the mountains to the coast and
became the supply route for shrimp
and other sea food.
This coastal road also supplied
platinum, mined in the region, and salt
extracted from the nearby island of
Amortajada close to the coast of
Ecuador. Another road, running later¬
ally from Cuzco to the coast, made it
possible to have fresh fish (considered
one of the greatest delicacies) in the
Inca capital within two days.
A. . striking example of the
ingenuity and foresight of the Inca
engineers is visible today near Macu-
sani in the Carabaya gold country
north-west of Lake Titicaca. In his
book on the Inca roads, Highway of
the Sun, Victor von Hagen describes
how the Royal Road climbs to a
dizzying height of 14,800 feet and then
passes under a glacier.
"Here," he writes, "the engineers,
anticipating the glacier's movement,
had raised a retaining wall to catch the
cascading rocks and to divert the
snows high above the road. Here and
there the eternal sweep and retreat of
the glacier had sent rock crashing into
and destroying a part of the road, but
generally speaking it was in a good
state of preservation."
Despite the passing of centuries and
the inclemencies of nature, the general
lines of the Royal Inca Highway can still
be discerned and stretches of it are
still intact. The suspension bridges in
particular have withstood the assault
of time and are to be seen in Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia where they are in
use in districts where the wheel is still
unknown even today.

DON QUIXOTE
OF THE RADIO
Father José
Salcedo's first
broadcast in
1948 from his
radio school
in Colombia.
|N 1947, a slender young
Catholic priest arrived in a forgotten
hamlet perched high in the Andes of
Colombia to take up his duties as
assistant pastor of the Parish of Suta-
tenza. Father José Joaquin Salcedo
brought to his first ministry a restless,
driving urge to improve the lot of
Colombia's campesinos who scrape

their livelihood from incredible farms
hugging dizzy mountain slopes. He
also brought his amateur radio trans¬
mitter.
At that time the village consisted of
eighty souls, but it was the largest
community in a parish of 9,000 whose
geography is typical of the Colombian
Andes. Sutatenza Parish grows coffee
in its warm valleys and raises sheep
on its bald, chilly peaks. Some plots

of Colombia's impoverished mountain communities, Father José Salcedo started
a radio school, which within a few years had become one of the world's most
successful education-by-radio programmes, with over one million "pupils"
in Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador.

are so steep, local legend goes, that
farmers seed them by shotgun.
Only one peasant in three could read
or write. Alcoholism was common, and
as often as not Saturday night in a
taberna ended in a brawl with the
principals finishing in the hospital.
Father Salcedo believed there was no
point in preaching sermons against the
tabernas; instead, he decided to com¬
pete with them.
In August of 1947 on the village
square of Sutatenza, he introduced the
people of the village to the motion-
picture screen. They thought they
were in another world; long after the
show ended, they huddled enchanted
around the projector to stare respect¬
fully.
Father Salcedo had gained a foot¬
hold. To consolidate it, he drew up
plans for a permanent theatre. The
village of Sutatenza offered its help,
but it was not enough and there was
no way of making a general appeal to
the parish for volunteer masons and
carpenters... not until Father Salcedo,
who had built his first radio at the age
of 13, turned to his amateur transmitter.
In May of 1948, Radio Sutatenza
made its first broadcast, which was
picked up by only three receivers.
The priest asked campesinos to help
him build the Sutatenza theatre and
promised to record the voice of every
man who aided him. Soon he was
broadcasting the campesinos' own
voices back to their amazed families
and sixty men a day were coming to
Sutatenza to work on the theatre,
bringing materials with them and
money when they could.
w
74
ITH the theatre finished,
Father Salcedo sought the help of the
campesinos in developing what was to
become the radio school. One day,
the radio announced that farmers could
make their contributions in chickens.
Father Salcedo received more than 800
and had to hire a truck to haul them
to market in Bogota. Money was also
forthcoming, and by 1949, he was able
to buy a 250-watt transmitter. There
were enough radios for fifteen schools
and the priest started broadcasting an
educational programme once a week.
Seven years later Father Salcedo's
home-made transmitter had been trans¬
formed into Acción Cultural Popular,
one of the world's biggest programmes
of adult education by radio.
Acción Cultural Popular broadcasts
its lessons six hours a day to 200,000
pupils scattered over twelve of Colom¬
bia's sixteen departments and over¬
flowing into neighbouring Venezuela
and Ecuador. The radio schools are
served by 6,000 specially built receiv¬
ers and 10,000 more are on the way.
Attendance at these remarkable
schools Is expected to rise to 1,000,000.
The programmes still go on the air
from Sutatenza, but they are now
carried by a 25-kilowatt transmitter, the
most powerful in all Colombia. The
Colombian Government backs Acción
Cultural Popular to the amount of
$800,000 a year and Unesco partici¬
pated through the United Nations tech¬
nical assistance programme.
Besides the studios and the trans¬
mitter in the transformed village of
Sutatenza, Acción Cultural Popular
now occupies most of the seventh
floor of the biggest office building in
Bogota. From an office with a pano¬
ramic view of the mountains of Gua-
delupe and Monserrate, Father Sal¬
cedo (1) continues to direct its work.
I asked Father Salcedo how
he could explain the phenomenal
growth of Acción Cultural Popular in
so short a time. "Any work which
meets a basic need of the people must
grow in direct proportion to this need,"
he replied. "Here, it is the need of
7,000,000 people in a country of
12,000,000 for literacy and general cul¬
ture. It is not surprising that the
number of pupils in the radio schools
has risen to 200,000."
"Some men in education have had
reserves about our methods," Father
Salcedo explained, "but they have now
come over to our side because we are
introducing scientifically-tested mate¬
rials In the radio school. It is exactly
for this reason that we requested
technical assistance from Unesco to
make our teaching methods more
scientific."
The receiving sets used in the radio
schoolrooms are marvels of simplicity
battery-powered short-wave recei¬
vers manufactured specially for Acción
Cultural Popular. They can be tuned
to only one station. Radio Sutatenza,
a precaution taken to preserve the life
of their batteries. Still on the theory
that culture should not be given away
for nothing, Acción Cultural Popular
sells a set and its batteries to a radio
school at cost price. Each school,
however, receives a free supply of
chalk, an eraser, textbooks and an
alarm clock so that pupils will know
when to turn on their set.
These little sets put in a hard day's
work in the radio schools, most of them
nothing more than rooms set aside in
adobe homes. The house of the most
educated campesino in a hamlet is
always chosen for this honour, and its
owner is given the title of auxiliar
inmediato. It is this "immediate auxi¬
liary" who takes attendance, turns on
the radio when school begins, and
writes lessons on the blackboard
according to instructions given him by
the unseen radio teacher.
He is one of the key men in Acción
Cultural Popular, this remote-controlled
teacher. The auxiliaries are always
the farmers with the most modern
ideas in their communities, and the
distinction of leading the radio schools
lends them even greater influence as
forces for bettering the villages.
Programmes begin at ten minutes to
six in the morning, the only time that
most men can spare from their fields.
Depending on the day of the week,
the morning programme of one hour
and twenty-five minutes consists of
classes in reading and writing, hygiene,
history, religious instruction or civics,
always followed by a news broadcast.
This programme is recorded on tape
and repeated at 3.50 p.m. for women
and again at 5 p.m. for any men who
might have missed the morning class.
In the evening, Radio Sutatenza is
on the air from 6.15 p.m. to 9 p.m., but
school is over. Then it offers music
both classical and popular news, var¬
iety shows, religious talks and a half-
hour's drama on the theme of history,
science, travel in Colombia or prob¬
lems affecting farmers.
The campesinos learn to write and
they write letters to Acción Cultural
Popular. The letters pour in at the
rate of 150 a day and they are a useful
key to the popularity of various pro¬
grammes. They also show how deeply
the radio school has penetrated the
inaccessible world of the campesino.
They write about everything. Some
thank the school for taking them out of
their solitude or for weaning husbands
away from tabernas. And some ask
practical, down-to-earth questions:
what's good for a bad grippe, how do
you cure a lame horse, how should
a common-law couple go about
marrying, what can be done about a
disobedient daughter, how can children
be educated if there is no school avail¬
able, how does a wife get money out
of a stingy husband. Every letter
receives a reply, although Acción Cul¬
tural Popular does not pretend to have
a solution to every question.

HERE are only 90-odd
miles- separating the Tenza Valley
from what was once the almost-
deserted village of Belencito in the
north of Boyaca. In those 90 miles,
you pass from an oxcart agricultural
economy to one of the newest steel
mills in Latin America. At Belencito,
in the surrealistic shadows of coke
ovens, conveyor belts and a 270-foot
high blast furnace, Acción Cultural
Popular began another experiment in
radio education.
The conversion of the campesinos of
Belencito into steel workers is a dra¬
matic story. The men learned to make
the transition from the hoe to the
rolling mill, while their wives adapted
themselves to an entirely new sort of
life that of an ordinary modern
community.

THE FOUR
FLOWERS
OF
TURKISH
ART
The art of the book reached an extraordinary degree of development in Turkey during the 15th and
16th centuries, with the beauty of the calligraphy equalling that of the illuminations. One theme is always
found in these works that of the "four flowers" the hyacinth, carnation, tulip and briar rose. The
flower of flowers was the tulip, considered to be sacred since the Arabic letters used to write it in
Turkish also spell the word God. In a society whose religious scruples forbade portraits on walls,
Turkish artists confined their portraiture to the pages of albums and poetic works. A remarkable school
of miniaturists produced this famous portrait of the Sultan Mohammed II, patron of the arts, inhaling
the perfume of a rose.

PEKING MAN
IN THE APOTHECARY'S SHOP
by G. H. R. von Koenigswald
N,lEANDERTHAL MAN is the
only fossil man of whom we have a
complete skeleton. In the case of all
older discoveries we have only iso¬
lated remains mostly of the victims
of accidents. Thus we find human
bones in limestones, and buried in
sandstones, gravels and rock fissures.
We also find them in medicine
shops and these "paleontological trea¬
sure houses" are certainly the most
remarkable of all. I am, of course,
not talking about just any apothecary
shops, but about Chinese ones where
almost anything which the vegetable,
animal and mineral kingdoms of China
have to offer can be bought.
Such remains are used as ingred¬
ients for medicine and, among various
other medicaments, "dragons' teeth"
are highly prized. These are not,
as their name might suggest, the
teeth of saurians and other large
reptiles, but the fossilized remains of
extinct mammals. It is already over
a century since specimens of this kind
gave us our first insight into the fossil
mammals of China and they have
since proved to be important links in
the research chain leading us back
to fossilized man.
G.H.R. VON KOENIGSWALD, of the Federal
Republic of Germany, has done extensive
research in Indonesia and South China,
where he made important finds concerning
Peking Man. He is professor of paleontology
at the University of Utrecht, Netherlands.
When I was working as a geologist
in Java, we became very interested in
"dragons' teeth". Did they, we won¬
dered, come from Java or from China?
We soon found that they all came
from China, but when we went into
the question more closely we found
that in ancient China there were once
animals which are still living in Indo¬
nesia. The most surprising example
was the orang-outang, the large
anthropoid ape, which still inhabits
Borneo and northern Sumatra.
To be absolutely sure that these
remains came from China, a visit was
made to Hong Kong in 1935, and
the large apothecary shops in the
"Western Market" were thoroughly
combed. The result was astounding.
The harvest included teeth of orang¬
outangs, tapirs, the Malayan bear,
Panda (the friendly Bamboo bears), of
deers, pigs, tigers and many other
animals. But not one single jaw
could we find. Large porcupines had
gnawed away all the bones and teeth
roots and only the crowns of teeth
remained. It was clear that all this
material must actually have come from
southern China.
The largest of all the ape teeth
found had a smooth surface instead
of the fine wrinkles found on an
orang-outang's teeth. I immediately
felt sure that we had come across a
new type of ape of enormous size.
Subsequently, in 1935, on the basis
of this single find I described Gigan-
topithecus, the giant ape of the Chi¬
nese apothecary shops.
Some of my colleagues disagreed,
declaring that the tooth was much too
large for an ape, and one of them,
Professor Weidenreich, at first main¬
tained that it was simply that of a very
large orang-outang. I made further
journeys to China, and in Canton I
found a magnificent upper molar, and
in another apothecary shop in Hong
Kong an unworn lower molar. In
certain respects both these teeth
show much resemblance to the teeth
of man, and Weidenreich, who had
been so sceptical at first, completely
changed his opinion, saying that he
now considered my Gigantopithecus
to have been a huge man. One
German anthropologist even wanted
to change the name to Giganthropus
(anthropus man; pithecus ape), and
even made a fantastic reconstruction
of the jaw bone.
Finally, 22 years after the discovery
of the original tooth, we were able
to reach a more positive conclusion.
On February 17, 1957, my old friend
and colleague, Dr. Pei Wen Chung,
exhibited in Peking an enormous jaw
which had been found in a cave in
Kwangsi, in southern China. It was
a lower jaw with a somewhat less
specialized anterior dentition than that
of the living anthropoid apes. But it
was an ape: the tooth found in the
Hong Kong chemist's shop had not
lied.
DON QUIXOTE OF THE RADIO (Continued from page 74)
76
To pave the way for this adaptation,
the aid of Acción Cultural Popular was
enlisted, and it assigned to Belen¬
cito its former programme director,
Father Alejandro Rodriguez, the first
collaborator of Father Salcedo in the
radio schools of Sutatenza.
Father Rodriguez first went on the
air in 1949. In 1951, he received a
Unesco international fellowship to
enable him to study the use of the
radio in adult education in Canada.
Following his stay in Canada, Father
Rodriguez travelled to Spain, France
and England, concentrating on the
organization of broadcasting and on
its technical side. Then he went back
to his microphone in Sutatenza until
early in 1954 when he left to direct
Radio Belencito. He started on a mod¬
est scale in the new mill town with a
1 -kilowatt long-wave transmitter. Radio
Belencito fits into a new network of
long-wave transmitters established by
Acción Cultural Popular at widely
scattered points in Colombia.
Although Radio Belencito retrans¬
mits certain basic programmes of
Radio Sutatenza, its objectives are not
quite the same. In Belencito, Father
Rodriguez uses the radio to help mould
a colony of campes/nos-turned-steel
workers into a living community. Be¬
sides its classes, Radio Belencito
broadcasts programmes for neighbour
hood centres in the steel town. The
radio serves the community as theatre,
orchestra and forum and, to supple¬
ment it, spare time teachers were
trained as neighbourhood leaders the
urban version of the auxiliar inmediato.
"Fifty per cent of our workers are
illiterate," an official of the Belencito
steel mill told me. "They learn quickly
and their mechanical aptitude is high,
but we want them to understand what
they are doing and why they are doing
it. This is extremely important to
them and to us. The Colombian eco¬
nomy needs this steel mill and we want
our workers to be integrated into this
new aspect of our economy."

Peking Man, a reconstruc¬
tion based on remains
found in the Choukoutien
caves near Peking. He
was capable of chipping
rough tools and maintain¬
ing fires for warmth and
protection, and his brain
was as large as that of
modern man. (See the
Unesco-sponsored "History
of Mankind, Cultural and
Scientific Development";
Volume I: Part 1. "Pre¬
history and the Beginnings
of Civilization" by Jac-
quetta Hawkes; G. Allen
and Unwin Ltd., London).
After Le Gros Clark
The Kwangsi jaw is larger than that
of a gorilla, which means that Gigan-
topithecus itself was larger than this
ape, the largest and most powerful
of anthropoid apes living today. My
Chinese colleagues estimated that it
must have been at least three metres
tall. I am still getting letters from
people asking whether Gigantopithe-
cus might not have been the "abomin¬
able snowman" from the Himalayas,
and people are very disappointed
when I have to tell them that I do
not think so.
Another discovery was made which,
although perhaps not so dramatic,
was no less fruitful. In 1900 a German
engineer named Haberer brought back
a large collection of "dragons' teeth"
to Germany and our first extensive
knowledge of the fossil mammals of
China is based on the description of
these specimens. The most remark¬
able item was a human tooth, extrem¬
ely worn and apparently very old.
It too had come from an apothecary
shop in Peking, and the search for
the fossilized remains of human
beings was therefore concentrated on
this area.
IJ HIS led to a now celebrated
event: the discovery of the Peking Man
(Sinanthropus) of which, in the first
place, a single tooth had been
unearthed. This was claimed by Pro¬
fessor Davidson Black to be a hitherto
unknown fossil man. A skull found
in 1929 by Dr. Pei, proved that Black
was right. Successful excavations
are still being made on the same site.
The teeth of the Peking Man are
very large and similar to some of
those found among our apothecary
shop specimens from Hong Kong.
There were also smaller teeth . and
because of the red clay which was
found on one part of the jaw, Father
Teilhard de Chardin (whose name is
also linked with the discovery of the
Peking Man) identified it as coming
from a Late Stone Age horizon which
is often to be found in caves. This
was the jaw of a "modern" man, only
a few thousand years old. One of the
teeth is so similar to the first tooth
found in the Peking apothecary shop
that both must have come from the
same strata. It was, therefore, a
modern tooth which put us on the
track of Peking Man I
The discovery of the Peking Man
brought the solution to an earlier
problem: whether the remarkable flat
skull cap dug up In Java by E. Dubois
in 1890 was that of a man or an ape.
In 1891 an indisputably human thigh
bone was added to the earlier find
though there was no direct proof that
both discoveries belonged to the
same subject. Dubois combined the
two and h;s "erect walking Java Ape-
Man", the Pithecanthropus erectus,
remained the most controversial fossil
for nearly 40 years.
The main reason for this was that
the ear region of the Java skull was
missing and it is precisely this part
of the skull which makes it possible
to reach a clear decision. In the case
of the Peking Man a complete skull
was available and in spite of his pri¬
mitive characteristics he was, anato¬
mically speaking, indisputably human.
This is also shown by the simple stone
implements and the layer of ashes
found at the place of discovery, which
makes it clear that he already knew
about tools and fire.
The shape of the Peking skull was
so similar to that of the controversial
Java find that Black concluded that
the Peking Man and the Java Man
must have been close relatives. The
remarkable thing was that Dubois, the
discoverer of Pithecanthropus, dis¬
agreed with this theory. Although he
had always previously defended the
human characteristics of his find, he
now denied that it was related in any
way to Peking Man and even went
so far as to declare that his Pithecan¬
thropus was an ape.
The only way to resolve such a
confused situation was to redouble
our efforts in searching for the Java
Man. We found a promising site in
central Java with exposed strata in
which there were many remains of
the same extinct deer, antelopes and
elephants as those discovered by
Dubois in association with his Pitne-
canthropus.
FcOR years we worked in this
area. During the rainy season the
downpour of water scattered . the
loosened fossils over the hillsides and
we eagerly went to work, soon assem¬
bling a large collection of teeth and
bones of extinct animals. This includ¬
ed the remains of hippopotamuses no
longer found in Asia various ele¬
phants, deer, pigs, tigers, rhinoceros
and other animals.
Then, one day in September 1937,
we made an important find. One of
my enthusiastic Indonesian collectors
came across a piece of skull. The
next day I hastened to the spot and
promised the workers ten cents for
every piece of skull they brought me.
I myself soon found a large piece of
the frontal bone, but my collectors
only brought me small fragments.
Too late I discovered what had
happened; the workers, had broken up
all the larger pieces in order to make
more moneyl I was eventually given
more than 40 pieces, but fortunately
there was very little difficulty about
joining them together since the skull
was over one centimetre thick.
It soon became clear that we had
actually found a second Pithecanthro¬
pus skull. It would be difficult to
find two skulls in a modern anthropo¬
logical collection which are so com¬
pletely alike as Pithecanthropus I and II,
although the places of discovery were
30 miles apart. The new find was
finally complete enough to include the
ear regions on both sides of the skull.
One glance was enough: Pithecan¬
thropus had undoubtedly been a
human being. After 46 years the
puzzle had finally been solved.

doorway. But this is not the end.
The monument will be destroyed unless
humidities are maintained, at least
until the mural paintings can be remov¬
ed and conditioned to the drier envir¬
onment above ground.
We have learnt much from our war¬
time experience of fire and pestilence
and, not least, that the slow decay of
susceptible material by exposure to
damp can be quite as destructive as
the damage from high explosives.
A picture may disappear from a wall
eaten up by mould growths, leaving
only a nondescript stain. But even
here science may have the last word.
I know of paper bearing invisible draw¬
ings having been nursed into shape
and successfully doctored by chemi¬
cals so that the drawings were actually
brought back to life again.
Things that are invisible to the naked
eye can be photographically recorded
by using the methods of ultra-violet
fluorescence, and in every police labor¬
atory there are several methods by
which it may be possible to recover
and decipher on charred or burnt
documents writings or drawings when
the ink seems to have been com¬
pletely burnt away.
The Italians are past masters at what
might be called preservation medicine
and surgery. This is born of a natural
facility in the studio and laboratory and
the untold wealth of their cultural heri¬
tage which demands incessant atten¬
tion. For it is not true that a monu¬
ment having survived from antiquity,
will necessarily go on surviving. Na¬
ture is always in a condition of change
and the change may be either sudden,
through excavation, or slow, through
neglect.
First come the rains, then growths
appear of moss, lichens or algae, and
the mortar is loosened. Ivy grows
over the ruin, attacks the structure
with its penetrating suckers. Humus
is formed, plants root themselves, the
level of the surrounding earth rises and
capillary moisture weakens the founda¬
tions so that the building becomes
derelict, and in this condition it is liable
to be used as a source of stone for
building or agriculture.
How different is the picture when the
aids of science are involved. The
modern architect and chemist knows
how to exclude moisture, prevent or
destroy damaging organic growths with¬
out contaminating the stone, introduce
a hidden armature of ferro-concrete,
grout walls with an approved cement.
THE SAME STATUE BEFORE AND AFTER RESTORATION. Left, ravaged features
of a 16th century painted stone statue of the Virgin, from St. John's Hospital,
Bruges, Belgium. Cracks and wrinkles have rendered the work almost unrecognizable.
Right, statue after it had undergone cleaning and restoration.
And, if the foundations are unsatis¬
factory or unstable hydrologically,
there are simple means by which
consolidation is possible using the
methods of electro-osmosis as applied,
for example, in Warsaw by Ceberto-
wicz to prevent the Church of St. Anna
from destruction due to the movement
of the clay slope on which it rested.
The clay was consolidated, the move¬
ment was arrested and a rock-like
basis for the structure provided by the
electro-deposition of calcium silicate.
G.I REAT advances have been
made in methods of conditioning the
air of museums and galleries to give
constant figures of temperature and
relative humidity and to remove dust
and noxious contaminents.
At least one war-time repository was
constructed in an underground mine
where, beforehand, the dew-point had
been continuously exceeded and mush¬
rooms were farmed commercially!
Control methods were put into opera¬
tion with the result that this mine,
though far below the surface of the
ground, became the perfect store room
for the most sensitive materials arch¬
ives, textiles, books and even salt-laden
Egyptian stele and other monuments:
no single object suffered damage.
But major problems remain. How
can one hope to deal with a monu¬
ment carved in crumbling latérite
exposed in a monsoon climate to
alternatives of fierce heat and torrent¬
ial rains? We do not know, but we
can do some calculated guess-work
which, in the scientific field, is often
the precursor of the pilot-experiment
that leads to an eventual solution.
Not long ago waterlogged wood was
considered to be practically beyond
. redemption. Now, the position is
much brighter, thanks to a concerted
attack by museum scientists working
in several countries, e.g. in Poland, at
the pre-Slav village of Biskopin which
is gradually being recovered from its
watery grave, on iron-age settlements
in Switzerland and on the frail but in¬
teresting timbers from mines and from
wells in the United Kingdom..
Each country has something to con¬
tribute. National museums take pride
in the quality of their conservation
work and friendly exchange of infor¬
mation in all such matters takes place.
The conservation of monuments is of
world importance, so much so, that an
intergovernmental organization exists
for the study of the preservation and
restoration of cultural property, the so-
called "Rome Centre" and this serves
all nations with up-to-date information
regarding methods and equipment and
materials and helps to train young
curators and museum technicians.
Its activities are known in many
countries throughout the world. It has
worked in collaboration with Unesco
for the protection of the Buddhist
temples of South Korea from destruc¬
tion and staining by water and lichen
growths, etc., and on Pakistan's
Mohenjo Daro, being seriously damag¬
ed by salt crystallizations.
It has also worked on Indian cave
paintings darkened by shellac, on the
painted tholos of Kasanluk in Bulgaria,
whose colours were flaking off in
layers, and on the Mayan site of
Bonampak in Mexico, where wonder¬
ful frescoes have miraculously survived
in the heart of the rain forests.
Work has also been done In Mor¬
occo, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and on
many Middle East sites, and on
medieval gold crosses in Vienna. Bib¬
lical scrolls have been studied, dissect¬
ed and made available to scholars.
Patiently, continuously, this labour of
conservation goes on, a constructive
service to preserve for posterity the
monuments of the past that have serv¬
ed through the ages as a solace and
an inspiration to mankind and will
do so in generations to come.

tectural legacy. Buildings and statues which stood the
test of time have been seriously damaged in recent
years by air pollution. The million tons of coal burnt
every year in Greater Brussels alone discharges about
20,000 tons of sulphur dioxide into the. air. The
sulphur dioxide dissolved in fog, rain and snow turns
into sulphuric acid, the corrosive power of which is
well known. The fumes released by automobiles is
an even more serious problem, the sulphur dioxide
produced being even greater than that from coal.
In Los Angeles the 50,000 tons of petroleum products
consumed each day, a few years ago, discharged
400 tons of sulphur dioxide into the air. The pollution
of the atmosphere of our cities and industrial centres
is thus the chief cause of the weathering and deterior¬
ation of public buildings and monuments. On the
calcareous stones of buildings a crust forms, and the
stone develops blisters or cankers, and cracks; then
the crust scales off, exposing to the elements a powdery
surface which is easily eroded by rain and wind. This
"disease" of stone, like an insidious form of leprosy,
Is nowadays attacking monuments and damaging them
at an alarming rate.

The admirable
12th century
doorway of the
Cathedral of Santiago
de Compostela,
Spain, is one of
the master works
from the past that
have been spared
the depredations
of man and the
elements.
