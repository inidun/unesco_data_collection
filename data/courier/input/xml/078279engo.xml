Lady of Brassempouy
This woman's head in ivory is one of the oldest sculptured reproductions of the human face.
Named "The Lady of Brassempouy", from the site of the cave in south-west France where it was
discovered, this remarkable example of Perigordian culture dates back to between 20,000 and
25,000 B.C. Men rarely figure in Palaeolithic art and even in cave paintings are usually depicted as
stick-figures (see back cover) or covered with animal robes. "The Lady of Brassempouy" is now in
the Museum of National Antiquities, at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris. (See also p. 33.)

THE EMERGENCE OF MAN
In the long progression towards Homo
sapiens, man's ancestors learned to make
and use different tools. Millions of such
tools are testimony to early man's skill
and craftsmanship where the marriage of
function and design often gave birth to
objects of great beauty. Cover shows
three examples from the Palaeolithic and
Neolithic periods: top an axehead; centre
a laurel-leaf spearhead; bottom, a
tooth-edged blade.

HIS issue is
devoted to a question which
has aroused passionate ar¬
gument and debate for many
years: The Origin of Man.
Recent research has provi¬
ded new answers to many
puzzling aspects of this
question. A few years ago,
Unesco convened an inter¬
national symposium on the
subject in collaboration with
the International Union for
Quaternary Research. The
proceedings have now been
published under the title
"The Origin of Homo sap¬
iens", produced for the
specialist (see bibliography
inside back cover). For this
special issue, the editors of
the "Unesco Courier" have
called upon some of the
leading authorities in the
field of palaeontology to
trace the story of man's ori¬
gins in simple language ac¬
cessible to the layman. It is
the editors' hope that the
texts and illustrations will
help to make all readers
more familiar with man's
past and the long road that
has been travelled since the
19th century refused to be¬
lieve that modern man ever
had any primitive ancestors.

Homo sapiens;
20 million years
in the making
by William Howe/Is
ODAY we can almost point
to the first real "ancestor" of man.
By this ancestor I mean a creature
who, among the evolving primates of
20 million or more years ago, had just
branched off from the group of our
nearest relatives, the apes a creature,
still very much like an ape himself,
whose descendants nevertheless
evolved continuously In a different
direction from that point on. We are
quite sure we have the fossil jaws
of such a creature his name Is
Ramapithecus (named romantically for
the Indian god Rama)who lived
about 14 million years ago, and the
story of our knowledge of him is an
interesting story about science itself.
We have realized for some time that
man arose In this way, from animals
leading to the apes on one side and
to ourselves on the other. After
Darwin's great book, "On the Origin
of Species", had made inevitable the
acceptance of evolution (including
human evolution), Thomas Huxley
almost at once showed how closely,
in every way, we resemble the great
apes. He said, In fact, that they,
the apes, are closer to us than they
are to monkeys.
This led to a lot of public jokes
and private dismay, and the Idea was
resisted in many ways, by scientists
as well as others. But now, after a
hundred years, all the study of anatomy
and, quite late, of such things as the
molecular structure of proteins has
WILLIAM HOWELLS, of the United States,
Is an International authority on prehistoric
man. He Is professor of anthropology at
Harvard University and a past president of
the American Anthropological Association.
Associate editor of 'Human Biology" and
'American Naturalist", he Is widely known
for his books on the story of man's
emergence, many of which have become
best-sellers (see bibliography, page 71).
only shown more and more positively
that Huxley was right. Indeed we can
go a step beyond Huxley and say
that apes of Africa, the gorilla and
chimpanzee, are more closely related
to man than is any of the three to
the orang-utang of Indonesia.
After Huxley's time, some anatomists
pointed to the fact that apes are
adapted in body form for brachiating,
or hanging and swinging from their
arms. This is a particularly good and
safe way for a large animal to move
in trees. Pointing also to our own
broad shoulders and flat, broad
chests, as well as to details of our
elbow and wrist joints, and arrange¬
ments of muscles, they argued that our
ancestors were likewise adapted to
a considerable degree for brachiation,
and for life in trees. This was one
more argument for close relationship
to the apes.
Here again, other anatomists resist¬
ed the idea, arguing that the
resemblances were not very signi¬
ficant, and perhaps had evolved In
parallel with the apes. They preferred
to think of an ancestral line which
had been separate from apes, or even
monkeys, for a very long time.
(Always in the background there
seems to have been an unconscious
revulsion against relating ourselves
to chimpanzees, by people who looked
on them as "animals", not noticing how
large-brained and intelligent these
same animals really are.)
They had arguments: we do indeed
stand upright, and our feet are very
different from an ape's; and our jaws
are now quite different, particularly
with small eye teeth which do not
project above the other teeth in the
obvious way an ape's do. Could these
larger teeth have evolved backwards
to smaller ones? Could the hand-like
foot of an ape have been made over
into a human foot?
These difficulties are not as great
as they once seemed. Such changes
are almost commonplace in animal
evolution, with teeth being diminished
or lost, and limbs modified in drastic
ways. In addition, we must not try
to picture our common ancestor as
though he were a chimpanzee or
gorilla; these animals have been
evolving too. As study has gone on,
and fact is piled on fact, most anthro¬
pologists have become convinced that
our forebears did indeed use trees like
the African apes, who actually live
more on the forest floor than in trees.
Still later, fossil jaws of the ancestral
ape Dryopithecus drew attention to
the very close likeness of the molar
teeth in ourselves and apes. Though
the first specimen was found in
France in 1856, it was during the early
part of this century that such fragments
were discovered in greater numbers,
from fossil-bearing beds of Miocene
and Pliocene age, and in the time
range of about 20 million to 8 million
years ago.
The fossils have come from other
parts of Europe and from India, and
later from East Africa, Georgia
(U.S.S.R.) and China. With all this, the
web of evidence has drawn tighter
around our connexion with the apes.
For Dryopithecus was evidently the
ancestor of the large apes, and his
remains are so widespread that we
can now hardly expect to find a new
and different fossil group in the future
from which we ourselves might have
come.
Another important fossil "ape", J)
Oreopithecus of Italy and East Africa,
who lived at the same time, became
well known a few years ago. But,

MIOCENE
THE ROAD TO HOMO SAPIENS
Drawings on the next four pages show artist Rudy Zallinger's impression
of primate and human evolution. The drawings are reproduced with the
kind permission of Time-Life Books, New York, and are taken from "Early
Man", a richly illustrated volume in the "Life" Nature Library series which
young and old readers alike will enjoy (see bibliography, inside back cover).
Above the figures is shown a time scale. The progression is not always strictly
chronological since in certain cases considerable overlap existed. Proto-apes
and apes were quadrupedal but are shown standing for comparison.
PLIOPITHECUS
An early proto-ape, it resem¬
bled the modern gibbon al¬
though its arms were not as
disproportionately long. Now
classed as an ancestor of the
gibbon line. First fossil re¬
mains found in 1834.
PROCONSUL
Once regarded as a direct
ancestor of man, but now
considered as a very early
ape, the ancestor of the
chimpanzee and perhaps of
the gorilla. Numerous frag¬
ments found in East Africa
add up to almost complete
skeletons. A contemporary of
"Pliopithecus".
DRYOPITHECUS
First of the fossil great apes
to be discovered, its remains
have been unearthed through¬
out Europe and in North India
and China. Fossils range
from about 20 million to 8
million years in age. Man is
considered to have emerged
from "Dryopithecus" stock.
OREOPITHECUS
A contemporary of "Dryopi¬
thecus", it is believed to have
stood about 4 ft. tall and
weighed about 80 pounds. Its
remains, discovered in Italy
and Africa, led scientists to
wonder if it could be a direct
ancestor to man, but it is now
widely regarded as a side
branch of the ape family.
6
20 MILLION YEARS (Continued)
while his body form was rather like
a chimpanzee's, showing a similar
kind of adaptation to trees in a related
animal, his teeth are quite different
from a chimpanzee's and from ours
as well, a fact which only links our
descent still more closely to the apes
of Africa.
It was out of the Dryopithecus stock
that man emerged, and in fact it was
from among the fossils of Dryopithecus
fossils that our ancestor Ramapithecus
became known. G.E. Lewis of Yale
in 1934 described the first upper jaw,
found in India's Siwalik Hills, and
pointed to some man-like features.
Your own mouth will show you these
things, where you can feel them with
your finger. Your dental arch is short
and rounded in front, while that of
apes has become increasingly longer
and broad across the front, with
large canine teeth and broad incisors.
Your molar teeth have the cusp and
furrow pattern of Dryopithecus, but
are square; an ape's are longer. This
length makes an ape's face projecting;
yours is straighter:
Approaches to the human shape
could be seen in the small fragment
of Ramapithecus as though he had
just set his foot on a path diverging
from Dryopithecus, although unfortun¬
ately we have not found the foot, only
the Jaw. So Lewis thought Rama¬
pithecus might belong in our ancestry.
But the tide of scientific opinion
and such tides are apt to Influence,
not facts, but the way we see facts
was against Ramapithecus, and the
fossil was put away in a drawer as
simply one more kind of Dryopithecus.

RAMAPITHECUS
Now considered by many
specialists to be the oldest
of man's ancestors in a direct
line. Probably still lived in
trees and resembled ancestral
apes more than man.
A. AFRICANUS
The first hominid, this early
form of "Australopithecus",
(or "Ape of the South") was
a biped, walked upright and
was able to run in the open
plains. This major change
from tree-hanging and using
the arms when walking on the
ground (like apes) happened
some time before 5 million
years ago.
,. ROBUSTUS
Though he stood upright and
had hominid features, "A.
Robustus" represents an evo¬
lutionary dead end in man's
ancestry. Dr. Leakey main¬
tains that none of the Austra-
lopithecines can now be con¬
sidered in a direct line with
the genus Homo (see p. 25).
ADVANCED
AUSTRALOPITHECUS
Possessed a bigger brain than
his predecessors, was a bi¬
pedal walker. A contemporary
of "A. Robustus". Primitive
tools discovered with both in
East Africa but which creature
produced them is not certain.
Known as the Pebble Culture,
the tools are small stones
with only a few flakes.
After almost 30 years, however, L.S.B.
Leakey found a very similar fossil at
Fort Ternan In Kenya, which he could
date as being 14 million years old.
It happened that at the same time,
Elwyn Simons at Yale was looking
once again at Ramapithecus. He was
impressed with what Lewis had
pointed to, and saw the same features
in Leakey's new specimen.
Perhaps more Important, Simons
rescued other pieces of Ramapithecus
from burial in museum drawers. He
began examining old collections in
various places from the U.S.A. to
India, and recognized a few more
fragments with the same special
features, fragments which had
previously been misnamed and
ignored, but which he identified as
fossils of Ramapithecus.
This careful sorting out made it
easier to see the slight distinctions
between Ramapithecus on one hand
and Dryopithecus, ancestor of the
apes, on the other. Thus we also
see the beginnings of the separating
paths of human and ape evolution,
or between animals properly called
pongids (apes) and those called
hominids (anything on the human side
of the same group). So palaeontology
is not all looking for fossils in old
river banks.
What brought the split about?
Evolution has "reasons" it follows
lines of successful adaptation but
we know so little about Ramapithecus
having only his jaws and teeth, that
we cannot see the "reason". We
cannot simply say that it Is better or
more successful to be "human",

HOMO ERECTUS
Usually referred to as the first
"true man" of the genus Homo,
but we now know that earlier
australopiths had many similar
traits and also worked tools. He
knew the use of fire and pro¬
duced the first true handaxe
(Abbevillian culture). First "Homo
erectus" found was the famous
Java Man of 1891.
EARLY HOMO
SAPIENS ?
Far more advanced than "H.
erectus", includes Swanscombe
and Steinheim Man of Europe
(250,000 years ago), probably
the earliest example of man's
modern species. His cutting im¬
plements were standardized and
finely made (Acheulean culture).
Acquainted with simple geomet¬
rical forms.
SOLO MAN
Extinct race of "Homo sapiens"
in Java. Known only from two
shinbones and skull fragments.
Lived at the same time as Nean¬
derthal but his skull was more
primitive, more massive and
thicker with heavier brows, and
closer to "Homo erectus".
8
20 MILLION YEARS (Continued)
because that really means nothing,
and Ramapithecus certainly resembled
the ancestral apes far more than he
resembled man. Like some chim¬
panzee populations he seems to have
lived In an open wood and, again
like chimpanzees, it is probable that
he was still a tree-user.
Professors Simons and Keith Jolly,
however, think he had begun to differ
in diet from chimpanzees (who eat
much coarse wild fruit) by using
tough but nutritious foods like nuts,
seeds and hard roots. This is because
his teeth had thicker enamel than
an ape's, and showed signs of heavy
wear. He seems to have used his
molars as grinders, more than his
front teeth, and this would be related
to his shorter face.
Ramapithecus lived from some time
before 14 million years ago down
at least as far as 8 million. Then,
simply because no fossils have yet
been found, there is a gap in know¬
ledge until 5 million years ago. But
surprising changes must have taken
place: by this time much more obvious
human ancestors had appeared, and
they are fairly well known from the
time between about 4 million and
1.5 million B.C. Here also, however,
there was a long wait for recognition
in the face of doubt.
It was in 1924 that Raymond Dart
in South Africa saw the first skull, of
a young child, in a box of fossils
brought from Taung. He thought from
its face and teeth that it stood
halfway between man and ape, and
he named it Australopithecus ("ape
of the south"). But he had not found

MODERN MAN :
HOMO SAPIENS
SAPIENS
Two schools of thought today
exist regarding modern man's
recent ancestors: the mono-
centric believes that today's
races had a common ancestor;
the polycentric sees them
descending from different
ancestral lines.
and we never do find a complete
skeleton, adult, and exactly dated;
and his colleagues rejected his idea,
believing this juvenile, still with its
milk teeth, to be merely an interest¬
ing new ape. Much later, and slowly,
did the many finds arrive which
showed that Dart himself had been
too cautious. (The further fossils were
found years ago by Dart and Robert
Broom In South Africa. New ones
are found every year, greatly added
to by discoveries In East Africa by
Dr. and Mrs. Leakey (at Olduvai
Gorge) and their son Richard (in north¬
ern Kenya) as well as by Professors
Camille Arambourg and F. Clark
Howell.)
In the jaws of these australopithe-
cines, the large (but human) back
teeth also strongly suggest powerful
chewing for tough foods. The front
teeth (canines and incisors) were
small and entirely hominid in nature,
not something partly ape-like. For
several million years there were two
lines of these australopiths: Australo¬
pithecus, barely the size of a modern
African pygmy, and Paranthropus, who
was a little larger but had jaws as
powerful as a gorilla's, though the
jaws were short and deep (for grind¬
ing with the back teeth), not long,
with a gorilla's large canines (for
stripping forest vegetable food).
The australopiths, we know, were
bipeds like modern man, capable of
running In the open plains. Their hip
and leg bones differ from ours today
in some ways, showing that they were
less efficient walkers. Nevertheless,
some time before 5 million years ago

20 MILLION YEARS (Continued)

they had passed a major milestone of
change, from tree-hanging, and from
using the arms when walking on the
ground (like apes), to a free upright
gait on an arched foot with an erect
torso. Apes can walk this way but
poorly: their feet are flat, their great
toes protrude and do not help in
pushing forward, their knees will not
straighten (except in orangs), and their
long, high pelvic bones make them
top-heavy.
"O we now know that defi¬
nite hominids go back before 5 million
B.C., while at the same time our
strong likeness to the African apes
means that we have a common ances¬
tor at a time not too remote. Ramapi¬
thecus looks like the beginning of our
line, and if he seems very ape-like we
must remember that it Is the human
side, not the ape, which has been
changing most rapidly. We can be
sure our ancestors abandoned trees
and a diet of fruit and coarse vegeta¬
ble matter, perhaps only in the last
10 million years or less.
The reasons why we became bipeds
are far from clear, though many have
speculated. Even now we cannot run
very fast: on uneven ground a gorilla,
using the knuckles of his hands in
running, can go as fast. We can,
however, cover long distances in
hunting, but could the first bipeds do
so? Carrying food in the arms to a
safe eating place might have encour¬
aged uprightness: so might the need
of a small animal to rise and peer
over tall grass.
Perhaps, in our tree life, we became
adapted to uprightness, as did apes,
but not to such a degree that, as in
apes, a heavy torso and long arms
encouraged throwing part of our
weight on our arms. Perhaps several
such factors combined; we cannot say.
But bipeds we were by about 5 million
years ago, with important changes
still going on in hip bones and feet
to make this kind of gait more
effective (see photos pages 42-43).
The australopiths are our undoubt¬
ed ancestors at that time; there
are no other possible candidates.
Once again, there is controversy
over the actual path of evolution.
Some think there was only one varied
species of australopith, not two
distinct lines. And in former days it
was assumed that there must have
been a "cerebral rubicon", a magic
brain size of about 750 cubic centi¬
metres below which an ancestor could
not be "human".
But simple stone tools, which are
over two million years old, have now
been found near Lake Rudolf in East
Africa. They could have been made
only by the australopiths since no
more "advanced" men are known to
have existed then; and the brains of
these austrapoliths were not larger
than a chimpanzee's. So shaped stone
tools did not wait for "man" to make
them, and it is thought likely that tools
actually helped the australopiths to
become "man", by accenting the
evolutionary advantages of skilful
hands and larger brains (1).
At any rate, this was the next
major step, the advent of Homo
erectus. His appearance, about. 1 mil¬
lion B.C., probably follows another
small gap in the record which might
make the difference from Australo¬
pithecus more obvious. "Homo", a
new genus, recognizes the difference,
and the new group. Also Homo
erectus is commonly spoken of as
the first "true man", but it is not clear
that such an expression is justified,
since many of his traits were already
present in the australopiths, who were
also working tools at an earlier time.
These new men, however, must
have presented an appearance more
like our own. In body size, and in
general features of the skeleton, they
were much the same as ourselves.
The head also would have looked more
"human", with a smaller face and with
jaws dominated at last by the brain-
case. However, this braincase was
thick, and brain size had come only
half the way from australopiths to
modern man.
The first Homo erectus to be found
was the famous Java man (originally
named Pithecanthropus), of 1891. He
caused a scientific explosion, as the
first really primitive man to come
to light, and even his own discoverer
came to think that he was really a
large tree-living ape. He reigned
virtually alone (very recently five new
examples of his skull have been
found) until the Peking men of north
China were discovered, but Homo
erectus is now recognized from East
and North Africa, and In Hungary
(Vertesszollos) and Germany (the
Heidelberg jaw).
We know little about the transition
to Homo erectus, or where it took
(1) Some of these same australopiths, be¬
fore the tools were found, had already been
classed by Leakey and others as very early
'men', or Homo and, following a suggestion
of Professor Dart, were named Homo habi-
lis, with the sense of being 'good with the
hands". We shall come back to this.
place. Writers like to argue for either
Africa or Asia as the "home of man",
but this may not be important. Rama¬
pithecus probably reached India from
Africa 10 million years ago at least,
and after that there must have been
hominids in both continents, at the
stage of Australopithecus. It happens
that their remains so far have been
found mostly in Africa, in favourable
spots like Olduvai Gorge.
We have a few suggestions of what
occurred. The large-jawed Paran-
thropus seems to have changed hardly
at all during three million years or
more. The site of Swartkrans, in
South Africa, yielded many of his
known fossil parts. It also provided
two or three jaw fragments, of the
same age, which Broom and Robinson
twenty years ago believed to be
different from Paranthropus, and more
advanced in form. They christened
the type "Telanthropus", though Rob¬
inson later decided that the parts
belonged to Homo erectus. In either
case, two different hominids were
there together, one being Paranthro¬
pus and the other a more advanced
kind. Here is a powerful argument
for the real existence of two different
forms at the same time.
few years ago, by an
almost magic piece of luck, three men
were looking over these and other
fragments in the collections in Pre¬
toria when they noticed broken edges
which could be fitted together to make
larger pieces, where this had not been
seen before.
They were able to join the "Telan¬
thropus" upper jaw to much of a face,
an ear region, and a bit of forehead.
(Palaeontology, I said, is not just a
matter of looking in river banks.)
This gave most of the face and front
of the skull, to which the lower jaw of
"Telanthropus" would have been a
fairly good fit. The whole thing
suggests Homo even more strongly
than before, but seems to be too
small in size.
At about the same time Mrs. Leakey
found a small crushed skull in the
lowest levels of Olduvai Gorge, be¬
low the well-known Zinjanthropus (a
Paranthropus) and dated to not quite
two million years. This was only the
latest in a series of similar finds from
Olduvai, all of which had been called
Homo habilis by Leakey and his
associates. Though fragmentary, they
were obviously not Paranthropus,
having higher skulls and smaller jaws,
and to many they suggested the

smaller South African form Australo¬
pithecus.
After a great deal of work, the new
skull was put together. This and the
reconstructed "Telanthropus" give us
a better picture: they are somewhat
more advanced than the known Austra¬
lopithecus but are still very small for
Homo. They may well be showing
us the ancestor who had just begun to
make stone tools and who, in the next
million years, turned into Homo.
Again, controversy. Some prefer to
call this little person Homo habilis, in
the belief that both Australopithecus
and Paranthropus became extinct, and
that this graceful little creature dev¬
eloped directly into high-skulled,
large-brained Homo sapiens without
passing through the stage of low¬
browed, thick-skulled Homo erectus.
But this raises the problem of who
might have been the ancestor of
Homo habilis, unless it was Australo¬
pithecus, whom he greatly resembles;
and also the problem of why remains
of only Homo erectus have been
found for the period immediately after.
It seems safer to assume, for the
present, that the Australopithecus line
began making simple tools nearly
2 1/2 million years ago and, during
a time from which we have almost
no fossils, grew larger in size and
advanced to the erectus stage, while
Paranthropus continued contentedly
munching coarse vegetable food with
his great jaws, ignoring tools, until
he became extinct.
If the first Homo erectus to be found,
the Java Man, was considered in the
1890s to be very subhuman, we know
better now. In Africa, and evidently
in Europe, he made large stone hand-
axes, or coups de poing, increasingly
well-shaped in comparison with the
earlier pebble tools.
We do not really know about how
he used them. All we can say is that
he occupied the warmer parts of the
Old World for at least half a million
years (and even some cool places in
Europe and China), as the major
glacial periods were beginning; and
that in this time he showed some
evolutionary progress in brains which
became larger and skulls and jaws
which became less massive.
At the moment, he may now seem
more like a well-defined "stage" than
he should, because we not only lack
fossils from the period just before,
but also have very few from the
hundreds of thousands of years follow¬
ing the second (Mindel) glaciation.
Change doubtless went on by small
steps during these times, but we
cannot see the steps just now.
The Swanscombe and Steinheim
skulls, of the Second Interglacial,
perhaps 250,000 years ago, and the
new Tautavel skull from the early Third
Glacial, are important. They are much
advanced over the known erectus men,
but they are still too few to help us
much, or show what was happening
worldwide. It is only in the Third In¬
terglacial and the last, or Fourth Gla¬
cial, mainly within the last 100,000
years, that we come again to a wealth
of fossil men, and to the Neanderthal
problem, the greatest controversy of
all.

was reported in 1856, he too was
thought to be subhuman by some, but
only an exceptional modern man, pos¬
sibly a diseased person, by others (the
first controversy, now forgotten). A
Neanderthal skull is indeed excep¬
tional, being very long and low, with a
continuous protruding bony browridge
across the forehead containing well-
developed sinuses or air spaces. But
the skull contours are not those of
Homo erectus, and the brain was at
least as large as our own.
Neanderthal man's face was equally
remarkable; it was long, protruding
sharply forward In the midline from the
top of the nose on down. Had his
nose not been so broad we might call
him "hatchet-faced", but modern "hat¬
chet-faced" north Europeans are apt
to be tall and slender, while the Nean¬
derthals of Europe were short and
stocky.
'ONTROVERSY over pri-
mitiveness and antiquity did not last
long. Today we know that Neander¬
thal man occupied Europe in the Third
Interglacial and much of the Fourth
Glacial periods (perhaps between
150,000 and 35,000 B.C.), and that he
was the author of the Mousterian va¬
rieties of retouched flake stone tool,
which were technically far advanced
over something like a handaxe. These
tools in some ways foreshadowed
those of the Upper Palaeolithic, which
were made from bladelike flakes and
were used by Cro-Magnon man among
others.
For a hundred years now, discov¬
eries of skeletons of the European
Neanderthals have given rise to a
conception of his "classic" form as I
have described it. They have also
reinforced the conclusion that he gave
way, with seeming abruptness, about
35,000 B.C. to men who were entirely
modern in physique, though robust,
and who were in fact like living Euro¬
peans.
This is the heart of the modern con¬
troversy, with strong opinions on both
sides. I have stated the distinctive¬
ness of Neanderthal man too simply
and sharply, in order to begin with a
contrast. In North Africa there were
other Neanderthal-like men, more mod-
en. in some ways, lacking the typi¬
cal facial projection of the Europeans.
They too were followed by modern
men of rugged build, apparently com¬
ing from the east about the same time
(35,000 B.C.), or perhaps earlier.
The Near East is more puzzling.
Men with Neanderthal faces, and
with Neanderthal peculiarities of the
skeleton, existed in the early
Fourth Glacial, with Mousterian tools.
But their skulls were not as "classic"
as the Europeans, and some of them
were remarkably tall, like the Amud
man of Israel, found by Japanese
excavators. (Here we must remember
that modern men vary greatly Scots
and Eskimos might be compared to
these Neanderthals in body size.)
The argument is over whether the
Neanderthals, in Europe or elsewhere,
were in fact replaced by invaders, with
really new Upper Palaeolithic methods
of tool-making, in a brief period (a
few thousand years); or whether the
Neanderthals simply evolved into mod¬
ern man on the spot, while his stone-
working, adopting new techniques,
made the changes from what is termed
Mousterian to what is termed Upper
Palaeolithic.
It Is a complex argument, and is
based partly on assumptions (and, I
believe, partly on tides of scientific
opinion, like older arguments). In
spite of all that is known, ways of
convincing opponents have not been
found. Some archaeologists empha¬
size transition in tool-making. Other
archaeologists grant that there are im¬
portant Mousterian survivals in the
early Perigordian culture of the upper
Palaeolithic of France. But they see a
clear break with the coming of a
second culture, the Aurignacian, which
has different tool-making techniques
and also a wealth of decorative
objects previously lacking. This they
view as something entirely new, an
intrusion; and they cannot imagine a
simple cultural evolution.
Similarly, some anthropologists can¬
not imagine biological evolution so
swift as to produce a modern face
and skull from that of Neanderthal
Man in a few thousand years. Others
are doubtful about the shortness of
the period, and emphasize intergrad¬
ation in shape between Neanderthal
and modern man, especially in the east.
They hold that evolution, not replace¬
ment, presents fewer difficulties. They
note that if there was an invasion, the
source of the "modern" Upper Palaeo¬
lithic men has not been found and that,
if the European Neanderthals are rather
special, the Near Eastern Neanderthals
are more intermediate and "progres¬
sive".
These scholars would paint a rather
simple picture of human history, prob¬
ably too simple. They suggest that
there was everywhere a "Neanderthal
phase" of human evolution in the last
glacial period, out of which all of us
Eskimos and Scots alike emerged
as modern man. This broad view as¬
sumes that there were Neanderthal
men everywhere in the Old World, as
there certainly were throughout Eur¬
ope and apparently around its edges.
Carleton Coon, in a well known
book, "The Origin of Races", has
argued for another theory something
like this one. Modern races appeared
in different parts of the Old World,
not from a single Neanderthal phase
or Neanderthal population, but from
different races of Homo erectus
already present in these places.
There are difficulties here, but the
theory does recognize something im¬
portant which the other scholars neg¬
lect: that there were other kinds of
Ice Age men, such as Solo Man of Java
and Broken Hill Man ("Rhodesian
Man") of southern Africa, who had
some of the primitive traits of
Neanderthal man but were really
quite different. They are less well
known: they are discoveries, or
facts, which are still hard to interpret.
Solo Man, though living at the same
time as the Neanderthals, had a much
thicker and cruder skull, more like
Homo erectus.
There is a final chapter to all this.
What do we know about modern man
himself? Living races seem very dif¬
ferent, some with very dark skin, some
with blond hair, some with narrowed
eye openings. But in form of skull
(and this is what we can compare with
early man) they are really much alike,
with smaller faces and higher, narrow¬
er bralncases. This is my own conclu¬
sion, after having worked with skulls
from all parts of the globe. I believe,
as do many colleagues, that all must
have some common source. But
where, and when?
H1ERE we are In a shadow-
land lighted by too few discoveries.
Outside of Europe, where we observe
the disappearance of Neanderthal
Man, remains are especially scanty.
Nevertheless, striking recent finds
seem to mean that Homo sapiens of
our own kind existed elsewhere, in
Africa and Asia, in the same period
as the Neanderthals of Europe.
They are different from those "pro¬
gressive" Neanderthals I spoke of.
Several skeletons from Jebel Qafzeh,
in Israel, have no radiocarbon date but
come from cave levels in which the
tools and the soils indicate a time
fairly early in the last glacial period,
probably well before 40,000 years ago.

And the skulls are surprisingly modern
not completely so, but being quite
different from Neanderthals. Only the
large bony brows, and perhaps larger
front teeth, in some of them, suggest
Neanderthal Man, and others of the
tribe had quite small teeth, and small¬
er, modern brows and faces as well,
as far as Is now known.
Two skulls found by Richard Leakey
in Kenya, of modern form or close to
it and not Neanderthal are surely
older than 37,000 years. Some autho¬
rities think they may be very much
older. For to the east a skull from the
Niah Cave in Sarawak (Borneo) has
been dated by two methods to about
40,000 BC, and it looks like a Melane-
sian or possibly an Australian.
I ODERN men of the same
general kind had made the difficult
water crossings (difficult for early
men) to Australia before 30,000 B.C.,
and many recent discoveries attest
the presence of such people there and
in New Guinea over the next ten
thousand years. In the New World,
recent finds prove the Indians were in
South America about 20,000 years ago,
much earlier than had been generally
believed, so that men had come to the
Americas from Asia probably several
thousand years before. No American
skeletons are as old as this, but we
can only suppose that these earlier
men were like the later.
Now here is the important thing.
All the known skeletons I have men¬
tioned were of modern form. In
addition, the European Upper Palaeo¬
lithic people had the nature of later
Europeans; the early Australians were
recognizably like later Australians or
Melanesians; and we can only suppose
that the first Indians of America were
the same kind of proto-Mongolold we
see In them today.
The Omo skulls of Africa cannot be
recognized yet, and otherwise there
are no African skulls quite so old.
But the signs are that, by the time the
Neanderthals vanished, or before, not
only was modern man fairly wides¬
pread, but the races we see today had
already taken shape.
We still cannot say how this happen¬
ed. It is strange that we should
know so little of our nearest ancestors.
But we cannot expect to have the
whole story after only one century of
searching. There are blank parts of
our history now, but they will be filled:
we have hundreds of years of ex¬
ploration ahead of us.

The
life and times
of
Stone Age man
by François Bordes
14
'ISCOVERIES in Africa in¬
dicate that the Old Stone Age, or
Palaeolithic period, began more than
two million years ago. The first stone-
worker was Australopithecus, half¬
way between the great apes (gorillas,
chimpanzees, orang-utangs) and our¬
selves, with a still rudimentary brain.
His tools were simply pebbles, chip¬
ped to give them a cutting edge, and
roughly trimmed flakes.
The evolution of man and his indus¬
tries took place over a very long
period. Pithecanthropus knew how to
use fire, at least in China, and produc¬
ed the Abbevillian and early Acheulean
industries, traces of which are found
in various parts of the world. Little is
known of the various types of man in
the Middle and Upper Acheulean
periods; and finally, about 100,000
years ago, Homo sapiens emerged.
A distinction used to be made be¬
tween Neanderthal man, Homo nean-
dertalensis, associated with the Mous¬
terian culture, and modern man Homo
sapiens, of the Upper Palaeolithic age.
FRANÇOIS BORDES Is professor of Pre¬
history and director of the laboratory of
Quaternary Geology and Prehistory at the
University of Bordeaux and director of Pre¬
historic Antiquities for the Aquitaine region
of France. An Internationally famous auth¬
ority on Palaeolithic tools, he can himself
make all the known varieties of Palaeolithic
Implements (see photo story page 22 and
bibliography Inside back cover).
The trend today is to establish two
sub-species, Homo sapiens neander-
talensis and Homo sapiens sapiens.
The exact relationship between
these two fairly different types Is still
a matter of controversy. It Is possible
that there were intervening links, mod¬
ern in some respects and Neander-
thaler in others and the evolution of
modern man must have taken place
more or less simultaneously through¬
out the ancient world. Men of a pre¬
sent-day type existed as far back as
the Mousterian period (as shown by
excavations at Djebel Qafzeh in Israel
and perhaps even before).
For the last 100,000 years, men have
lived in very different environments,
the result of geography or climatic va¬
riations. Such variations were particu¬
larly marked In the Quaternary or last
of the geological eras: several times
huge glaciers spread over not only
Greenland and the Antarctic (where
one can see their vast traces today)
but also Scandinavia, North America
and all high mountains, even at the
equator. At their maximum, the Scan¬
dinavian glaciers covered the north of
Germany, most of England, and a great
part of the western U.S.S.R., while in
France the Alpine glaciers came down
almost to Lyons.
These- Ice Ages were matched by
oscillations when the earth's tempera¬
ture fell, though the maximum cold did
not necessarily coincide with the maxi
mum glaciation. Depending on the
period and the place, the cold would
be damp or dry, and In the regions to
the south of the glaciers a variety of
vegetation developed, ranging from
tundra to forest.
In Europe, however, the prevailing
feature was more or less densely
wooded steppes. This lowering of
temperature naturally extended beyond
today's temperate zones, but tropical
and equatorial regions seem to have
been little affected, though depending
on the amount of rainfall there were
periods when deserts spread or shrank
almost to nothing.
The accumulation of water locked up
in the huge glaciers (islandsis) meant
that the level of the seas went down
considerably, sometimes more than
300 feet, with inevitable geographical
changes. England was a part of the
continent, and Japan was attached to
Asia. Our ancestors thus lived In a
changing world (even if the changes
were only gradual) frequently very
different from the world we know.
Throughout this period tool-making
depended primarily on stone as the
basic tool for shaping other tools from
wood, bone, antler, horn, leather, etc.
These have all disappeared, with the
exception of those in bone and antler,
which have often been preserved.
Those who know nothing of the
subject often speak slightingly of

STONE AGE MAN (Continued)
The myth of the troglodyte 'cave men'
Palaeolithic man and his "clumsy flint
tools". In fact, he was a consummate
craftsman who made the best of his
material. If many of his implements
appear crude, it is because ^-flint,
though easily flaked by a skilful
workman, has a fragile cutting edge
which wears away quickly, or rather
which chips; flint is harder than steel,
as you will see if you scratch the blade
of a knife with a piece of flint. Other
tools or weapons, designed for lasting
use or requiring a perfect ' form for
functional * reasons, were admirably
well shaped.
Not all tools were of flint. In some
regions flint does not exist and was
replaced by obsidian (volcanic glass)
which has a still sharper, though more
fragile cutting edge, quartzite, sand¬
stone and quartz, which is more in¬
tractable, but for which the right work¬
ing techniques had been evolved.
In other areas, fine-grained eruptive
rocks were used, such as basalt and
rhyolite. Tools were often a varied
collection, the finer ones in flint or vol¬
canic glass, the rougher ones in basalt,
quartz or quartzite; the choice of
material depended on the use to which
the tool was to be put.
For flaking stone, man first used ano¬
ther pebble; later, from the Middle
Acheulean period onwards, he realized
that better results could be obtained
with a softer striking tool, or hammer,
of a cylindrical shape, in wood, bone
or antler. Perhaps during the Moust¬
erian age, but certainly in the Upper
Palaeolithic, he began striking by indi¬
rect Impact, placing a wooden or bone
chisel between the hammer and the im¬
plement to be shaped. He also used
pressure flaking, which permits finer
and more regular retouches, though
smaller than those produced by strik¬
ing. In the Solutrean period, about
19,000 years B.C., man discovered that
strong heat applied slowly to flint, fol¬
lowed by a slow cooling process,
changed the structure of the stone and
made it easier to flake by pressure.
In the Upper Palaeolithic age men
hollowed out limestone to make blub¬
ber lamps, sometimes decorated, but
they did not, to our knowledge, fashion
vases, which did not appear until con¬
siderably later. A distinction is fre¬
quently drawn between the Palaeo¬
lithic (The Old, or chipped Stone Age)
and the Neolithic (the New, or polish¬
ed Stone Age). But, apart from the
fact that Neolithic man chipped stone
far more than he polished it, artifacts
in polished stone are by no means un¬
known in Palaeolithic times (for exam¬
ple in Central Europe); and partly pol
ished axes have even been found in
northern Australia, pre-dating those of
European Neolithic by some 15,000
years.
Since the great bulk of artifacts in
perishable material have not come
down to us, our ideas about the daily
life of our far-off ancestors are based
mainly on the examination of bone and
stone implements, the study of depo¬
sits, and a comparison with primitive
peoples of today or recent times. In
cold regions, our ancestors lived
mainly by hunting, eked out by fish¬
ing, and, if the climate was suitable,
the gathering of berries, seeds and
roots. In warmer climates it is pos¬
sible that fruit-gathering was a major
food resource as it is today for the
bushmen of the Kalahari Desert.
Living patterns were not the same
for the Middle Palaeolithic (the Mou¬
sterian and similar industries), domi¬
nated by Neanderthal man, and the
Upper Palaeolithic, by which time
modern man has emerged. There are
however a certain number of constant
factors.
As regards living quarters, people
often talk about "cave men" as if pri¬
mitive men led a purely troglodyte
existence. In fact, they lived chiefly

at the entrance to caves, or under
overhanging sandstone, limestone or
basalt rocks hollowed out by erosion.
But these would have provided very
poor shelter from the intense cold of
the Ice Ages if they had not been
suitably fitted up with skin tents or
huts. Occasionally one finds traces
of the uprights which supported the.
roof, or circles or rectangles of stones
which indicate the foundations.
In or near these huts are to be found
hearths, sometimes merely places for
lighting a fire, marked by reddened
stones and ashes. Elsewhere, there
are more elaborate hearths small cir¬
cles of stones, or hearths floored with
pebbles which were perhaps used for
cooking; the fire heated the pebbles,
which were then swept clear of embers
and ash, and the meat was roasted
directly on the floor.
Other hearths are full of stones
which have been split by the heat.
One can visualise two ways in which
they were used. Either the stones, pla¬
ced directly in the fire, accumulated
heat and then radiated it when the
fire was extinguished, or alterna¬
tively, when hot they were taken out
with wooden tongs and thrown into
a leather bag containing water, to make
the water boil and produce a meat
stock. The Eskimos use this tech¬
nique today.
In warm regions, caves and shel¬
ters were probably fitted out more
simply, with wind screens instead of
huts. Open air camps probably re¬
sembled those of the bushmen or
Australian aborigines, with screens or
huts made from branches. In rainy
areas, protection was provided by a
roof of leaves or thatch.
Open-air camps are however also
found in cold regions, either in areas
where t there are no caves, or else
used as transient camps for the sum¬
mer. Many of these camps are in Cen¬
tral Europe and the U.S.S.R. They
range from the simple round family

the walls reinforced with the bones
of large animals, to the large commu¬

Such open-air camps also existed in
France in Mousterian and Upper
Palaeolithic times. In general, the only
indications of the Mousterian camps
are sites thickly scattered with chip¬
ped flints, debris, burnt stones and
remains of bones. Upper Palaeolithic
camps are well organized; frequently
marked by a series of post holes to
show where huts or tents stood, and
positioned on small spurs overlooking
two valleys, where possible on flat
sandy soil. The reason will be clear
to anyone who has ever camped.
w

HILE the large dwellings
In eastern Europe were probably
permanent living quarters, the equi¬
valent of the non-existent cave, the
simpler ones in the west were most
likely hunting or summer camps. From
the fact that the tool kits found there
are not basically different from cave
tools of the same period, it can be
deduced that the hunting expeditions
included women, who were respon¬
sible for dressing skins and smoking
meat.
It is possible that Palaeolithic man
led a semi-sedentary life in the sense
that the caves were inhabited all the
year round by part of the group, and
a^ semi-nomadic life in the sense that
hunting expeditions were divided up
into temporary camps. The same is
true for bushmen today: sometimes
the tribe lives all together, at others
it breaks up Into little groups.
As regards clothing, comic strips or
illustrated novels often show prehis¬
toric man with only the skin of an
animal round his loins. This may
have been the case during warm
periods or on fine summer days, and
of course in tropical areas where clo¬
thing was perhaps even more redu¬
ced. But for life in an ice age, parti¬
cularly in winter, a costume similar to
that of the Eskimos is much more
likely, considering that the temperature
must often have been below minus 40
degrees.
The bone needle was only invented
in the Upper Solutrean age around
17,000 or 16,000 B.C.but while it is
a help to sewing it is not indispens¬
able. Earlier tool kits include bone
points and flint drills with which it Is
easy to make holes in a hide. Thread
was provided by vegetable fibres or
the tendons of animals, in the same
way as tendons of reindeer are used
today by Arctic peoples.
There is also no doubt that Stone
Age man had shoes, probably like
moccasins, even though the footprints
found In caves are all of naked feet.
Tool kits varied from one period to
another and from one industry to ano¬
ther, probably corresponding to diff¬
erent populations. They also devel¬
oped over the ages inside the same
industry.
In the Mousterian age, stone tool
kits are the overwhelming majority of
the artifacts preserved, and are mainly
of flint flakes. They Include a variety
of scraping tools flakes with one or
more edges trimmed to make them
even. They may have been used for
scraping hides, and certainly as knives
and for woodworking. In addition,
there are notched pieces, flakes with
toothed edges like saws, scrapers,
burins or gravers, borers, backed
knives made from elongated flakes or
blades with one edge broken off to
make it possible to lay a finger along
it (as with the blade of a modern
knife).
Among some varieties of Mouste¬
rian tools, there are still hand axes or
"coups-de-poing", multiple purpose
tools, as in the preceding Acheulean
age. Bone tools are no more than
splinters with the end worn down
(perhaps for making clothing) or bones
which show signs of having been
crushed, which may have been pres¬
sure tools for trimming flint.
II N the Upper Palaeolithic
age tool kits were more varied and
specialized. A small number of side
scrapers subsisted, to be replaced by
various kinds of end scrapers. The
number and variety of gravers increas¬
ed considerably, probably partly due
to bone working, which became very
important. Borers, backed blades and
bladelets also play a role, but their
purpose is not always clear. Bone
tools Included points, smoothing tools
for sleeking hides, and towards the
end, needles.
Weapons were used primarily for
hunting, since war, in the modern
sense of the term, was little known in
Palaeolithic times, though there may
have been brief skirmishes over terr¬
itorial hunting rights. Weapons also
varied from one period and one place
to another. The Mousterians had flint
points, spear or Javelin heads, wood
en spears, a few bone points and
probably clubs. Upper Palaeolithic
weapons were more developed
various kinds of flint projectile points,
such as the magnificent Solutrean
"laurel leaf" and shouldered points;
also a great quantity and variety of
bone points, and harpoons during the
last, or Magdalenian period.
While Mousterian projectiles were
thrown by hand, the Upper Palaeo¬
lithic age saw the development of the
spear thrower, which is still used by
Eskimos and Australian aborigines to
give greater range and penetration to
spears. It Is just possible that by the
Upper Magdalenian age bows were
used, but so far there is no positive
proof of this.
Hunting is as old as man, and it is
highly probable that it was a factor
in his evolution, setting a premium
not only on strength and speed but
also on intelligence. By the time of
Homo sapiens, whether Neanderthal
man or modern man, it had existed for
more than two million years; and
Acheulean man, more than 100,000
years ago and perhaps even 500,000
years ago, was already a big game-
hunter or "giant-killer".
There were various means of hunt¬
ing, with spears thrown by hand and
later with spear throwers or bows, dif¬
ferent types of snares, the use of fire
to make animals stampede and leap off
a cliff, tracking with several hunters
taking over from each other until the
prey was exhausted. This is probably
how reindeer, bison and horses were
hunted.
Snares probably varied with the size
of the game : large herbivorous ani¬
mals were probably caught in pits dug
in the ground and covered with bran¬
ches and leaves. Suspended traps
were laid for carnivores, devised so
that when the animal tried to take the
bait he would bring down a roof
weighted with heavy stones, or be
pinned to the ground by a spear;
snares with springs were probably used
for smaller animals such as hares.
Fishing varied in importance accor¬
ding to the period; fish-bones are
only rarely to be found in Mouster¬
ian deposits, though this may be due
to the fact that little effort has been
made to look for them. The Mouster¬
ians probably fished chiefly with
spears or by hand, as we know of no
special fishing equipment.
In Upper Palaeolithic sites, however,
vertebrae and other fish bones are
found fairly frequently. There are

small bone artifacts, pointed at both
ends, which may have been straight
hooks of the kind primitive tribes use
today, harpoons (for both fishing and
hunting), forked objects which may
have been pronged harpoons, all
chiefly in the Magdalenian age, during
which fishing probably played an im¬
portant part.
It is also probable that nets were
already In existence. Some pebble-
flagged floors are supposed to have
been surfaces for drying fish. The
catch seems to have been chiefly sal¬
mon and trout, but remains of eels,
perch and pike are also found.
Little is known of plant resources,
but fossil pollen analysis shows that
the hazel tree must have flourished in
Europe at some periods. Some acorns
are edible. Wild strawberries, rasp¬
berries, sloes, blueberries and black¬
berries also existed and it is very
probable that water-caltrops were
gathered. The bulbs or tubers of
several plants of the period, partic¬
ularly the lily family, were edible, as
also were wild carrots and sorrel.
Gathering was part of the work done
by women and children. In Africa
and south-east Asia plant resources
must have been even more varied.
HE use of fire has been
known to man since Homo erectus, at
least in Asia and Europe, for in Africa
the indications are so far of a later
date. This does not mean however
that Homo erectus knew how to light
it. He may simply have kept it alight
after taking it from a fire due to natural
causes such as bush fires produced
by lightning, marsh fires, etc. But In
the Mousterian culture and still more
in the Upper Palaeolithic age, there Is
no doubt that man knew how to light
fire.
There are two main methods, by
rubbing and by striking. A pointed
wooden stick may be rubbed to and
fro in a groove hollowed out in soft
wood, or rapidly rotated by hand or
with a bow. Striking is not, as is
often thought, the striking of one flint
against another, as the resulting
sparks are simply cold light; a flint is
struck against a lump of iron pyrites.
In some deposits fragments of iron py¬
rites have been found which show tra¬
ces of having been struck; sometimes
they are so worn that they must have
been used regularly as lighters.
It is difficult to estimate the density
of the population, which must have
been thinly scattered, with occasional
large concentrations of several hun¬
dred people living in neighbouring
sites.
The expectation of life was not long,
though recent research tends to leng¬
then the estimates. It was probably
rare to live beyond fifty. There must
have been a high rate of infant mor¬
tality and deaths in childbirth.
The first undeniable burials appear
with the Mousterian culture. In Cor-
rèze, at La Chapelle-aux-Saints, a man
was found lying In a trench with his
knees drawn up and his head pro¬
tected by large animal bones. A bison
leg had been placed by his head, and
beside him in a small pit were a bison
horn and frontal bone, as provision for
a journey or a funeral offering. In
a Mousterian deposit at Shanldar In
Iraq, pollen analysis indicates that a
man was buried on a bed of flowers.
In the Upper Palaeolithic age funeral
rites were more complex. The dead
were often buried with fine objects in
flint and bone and elaborate necklaces
of pierced shells, and were powdered
with red ochre. Sometimes large
stones were placed on their hands and
feet, perhaps to prevent them coming
back to haunt the living.
There are many children's burial
places, and the Soviet prehistorian
Okladnikov attributes this to the fact
that Palaeolithic man was more inter¬
ested in the fate of dead children than
that of dead adults. It is also worth
noting the large number of women's
burial places, often as richly ornamen¬
ted as those of men, which seems to
indicate that discrimination between
the sexes was unknown among Palaeo¬
lithic hunters.
Art probably appeared earlier than
one imagines. Many Mousterian sites
yield mineral paint such as black man¬
ganese dioxide and yellow and red
ochre. But we know of no engravings,
sculptures or paintings depicting ani¬
mals before the Upper Palaeolithic age.
The Mousterians probably used min¬
eral pigments for painting on perish¬
able materials, and perhaps their own
skins, like Australian aborigines.
In the Upper Palaeolithic age, how¬
ever, art developed considerably, parti¬
cularly in the Magdalenian culture, pro¬
ducing splendid achievements in en¬
graving, sculpture and painting compa¬
rable to those of classical antiquity.
It is mainly animals that are portrayed,
but in some caves such as those at La
Marche (Vienne, France) we have a
large number of human figures, fre¬
quently caricatures, as if the exact
portrayal of the human figure had been
taboo.
As regards magic and religion, var¬
ious Interpretations have been given
to prehistoric art. When it was first
discovered, it was argued that such
art was an expression of a highly dev¬
eloped aesthetic sense; subsequently
the theory was long entertained that
prehistoric art was used to cast spells,
either for successful hunting or to
replenish the stock of game.
Recently, Professor Lerol-Gourhan's
school has interpreted it as the ex¬
pression of the dualism between male
and female, some animals represen¬
ting the male principle, others the fe¬
male. There is certainly no straight¬
forward answer; an explanation which
may be valid for the Aurignacian
period (30,000 BC) is not necessarily
so for the Magdalenian (15,000 to
9,000 BC).
M OR a long time it was
believed that paintings were to be
found only on the walls of deep caves
which may have been sanctuaries, but
it now appears that most rock dwel¬
lings were decorated. The great bulk
of decorated caves are in western
Europe, but one has been found in
the Urals.
Much has been conjectured about
the religion of the Stone Age, but
nothing is known for certain. Funeral
rites seem to indicate a belief in ano¬
ther world. The theory of bear-wor¬
ship by the Mousterians has been
strongly contested, but recent investi¬
gations give it a new lease of life.
As regards social organization, we
know very little, since in most cases
we cannot tell the size of human
groups during this period. We still
do not know whether a given number
of tools found In a particular layer
represents 10 men over 100 years, or
100 men over 10 years, though recent
studies are beginning to throw a little
light. Similarities between tool kits
and works of art suggest contacts
between various human groups over
fairly large distances.
In conclusion, much remains to be
learned about daily life in the Stone
Age, but what we do know suggests
that while it was certainly a hard life,
it was not on the whole a wretched
one. Where game was plentiful, man
must have had spare time for sculpture
or story-telling. Unfortunately, while n-f
certain works of art have come down /l
to us through the ages, the entire oral
tradition of stories, legends and songs
has disappeared for ever.

Our
African
ancestors
24
by Louis S. B. Leakey
HERE have been so many
discoveries concerning the evidence
of man's origin during the past few
years that nearly every textbook
available today on this subject is out
of date. The facts that will be given
briefly in this paper have all been
published in such scientific journals
as Nature, or have been presented
before international meetings and
discussed by our colleagues. Only a
limited part of the evidence is yet
available In book form.
LOUIS S.B. LEAKEY, of Great Britain, Is world
famous for his discoveries of fossil remains
in East Africa. He began his first archaeolo¬
gical research there in 1926, when he was
23, and has devoted his life to this work
ever since. His most exciting finds have
been made In Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. He
is now honorary director of the National
Museum Centre for Prehistory and Palaeon¬
tology in Nairobi (Kenya) and honorary pro¬
fessor of anatomy at the University College
of Nairobi. He has published many books
and studies on his excavation and research
into man's past In Africa (see bibliography
inside back cover). Dr Leakey took part In
Unesco's 1969 International symposium on the
origins of Homo sapiens, In Paris.

Left, the famous fossil skull of Zinjanthropus found by Dr. and Mrs Leakey at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, in 1 959,
and described at the time as the earliest ancestor of man ever found, dating back 1.750,000 years. The skull
of this australopithecine is here compared with the skull of a modern man (centre) and a gorilla (right). The
recent discovery at Lake Rudolf, Kenya, of the remains of an australopithecine who lived more than half a
million years before Zinjanthropus, at the same time as a Homo-Mke creature, has completely upset earlier
theories, writes Dr. Leakey. "Most textbooks", he says, "still place the genus Australopithecus (including
Zinjanthropus) in the direct line of ancestry of the genus Homo, and therefore of Homo sapiens. This view
can no longer be scientifically maintained".
East Africa today figures very
prominently indeed in the story of the
evolution of the direct ancestors of
man himself, as well as of his nearest
cousins the great apes and although
this article will mainly be concerned
with the end part of the story, from
about 3 million years ago onwards,
it must begin by discussing briefly
the discoveries of the Miocene
period, which began about 20 to 25
million years ago.
In spite of the fact that Darwin,
more than 100 years ago, ventured to
predict that one day it would be found
that man had originated in Africa, few
people believed him and it was only
In 1924 that the first indications were
obtained that, in fact, Africa had very
early fossil primates.
The story begins with a discovery
made by Doctor, H.L. Gordon, who
was living at Koru, in Kenya, and
engaged partly in farming and In a
limited medical practice. Because of
his early training and interest In
zoology he began to notice that
following the ploughing of the land
of his farm and on subsequent
washing of the ploughed soil by rain,
fragments of fossil bones and teeth
were visible and he began to collect
these and submitted them to Mr. E. J.
Wayland, the Director of the Geo¬
logical Survey in Uganda, and to me
in 1926 in Nairobi. We both realized
that Dr. Gordon had made a very
important discovery and thus, through
the accident of having a doctor as
well as a farmer at a critical place,
began the long series of discoveries.
Since those early days, East Africa
has yielded a vast collection of fossils
of Lower and Upper Miocene age,
among which are more than 500 fossils
representing the higher apes and also
examples of Proto-man. A similarly
important early discovery was made
in the same year, 1924, at Taung in
South Africa when a student brought
a fossil specimen to his professor of
anatomy at the Medical School in
Johannesburg. This proved to be the
first discovery of a "near-man" or
australopithecine. Thus, 1924 was an
important year for the African con¬
tinent. As will be seen in this article,
discoveries followed thick and fast.
During the early Miocene period
East Africa was inhabited by a number
of higher primate forms, among which
were true ape-like creatures such as
Proconsul africanus at one time
regarded as In the direct line of
ancestry of man and also ancestral
forms of the gorilla, chimpanzee and
gibbon as well, possibly, as an
ancestral orang-utang.
Living side by side with these
extinct apes in East Africa, at that
remote period, was Kenyapithecus
africanus who is regarded by me, and
by many of my colleagues, as in the
direct line of ancestry of man and
the "near-men". This view is not
universally accepted, but the evidence
is very strong. In any event, Kenya¬
pithecus africanus Is much more
similar to a possible ancestor of man
than the other primates which were
contemporary and listed above.
By the Upper Miocene period around
12 million years ago, the evidence
from East Africa Is much more definite.
At Fort Teman, an Upper Miocene site
in Kenya, we have found fossils of
a proto-man named Kenyapithecus

wickeri, whose remains are so similar,
morphologically, to Ramapithecus of
India, but a little older in time, that
some authorities consider the two
species to be identical.
That question can only be settled
when more specimens are found. In
the meantime, what is certain is that
in the Kenyapithecus wickeri speci¬
mens we have a primate with a
large number of hominid characters
and one which is universally accepted
as a hominid or man-like creature,
not a pongid or member of the ape
stock.
Not only does Kenyapithecus wickeri
have physical characters such as small
canine teeth, shovel-shaped incisors,
rounded mandibular arcade and a
short face, which are all hominid
characters, but he was also using
stones to break open antelope skulls
and limb bones, in order to obtain
the brains and marrow. The evidence
for this statement lies

In other words, an Upper Miocene
ancestor in Kenya, around 12 million
years ago, was already extending his
food beyond mere plant products to
include animal proteins.
It was probably this widening of his
food resources that enabled the
descendants of Kenyapithecus wickeri
to survive, when Proconsul and many
of the other primates, at this time,
became extinct. Although it is not
possible to say that Kenyapithecus
wickeri must be the ancestor of Homo
sapiens It would certainly seem likely
that he represents the stock from

IJN 1931, during my Third
East African Archaeological Expedi¬
tion, we recovered a fragmentary
mandible In a highly fossilized condi¬
tion- at Kanam West on the shores of
the Kavirondo Gulf of Lake Victoria,
Kenya. The specimen was highly
mineralized and derived from deposits
of Lower Pleistocene age, as determin¬
ed by the fauna. It had been badly
damaged before being embedded in
the deposits in which it was found,
and the lower margin was missing. I
described it as Homo kanamensis and
further indicated that it had many simi¬
larities to Homo sapiens. With very
few exceptions, my colleagues refused
to accept the evidence that this
specimen was of Lower Pleistocene
age, but I never retracted from my
stand, because I knew the evidence
was sound.
It was also during the Third East
African Archaeological Expedition in
1931 that I and my colleagues
discovered that the famous Olduvai
Gorge was very rich in early Stone
Age cultural remains.

Gorge itself was entirely accidental

OUR AFRICAN ANCESTORS (Continued)
'I almost trod on a half exposed fossil skull'
and dates back to 1911, when a German
butterfly collector, Dr. Kattwinkel, was
chasing a butterfly across the eastern
corner of the Serengeti Plains. He
was so intent on making his catch
that he nearly fell to his death over
the edge of the Gorge. Having lost
his butterfly and escaped with his life,
he climbed down the sides of the
cliff and found some magnificent fossil
bones of a three-toed horse, which he
took back to his colleagues in Berlin.
In 1913 a German expedition was
sent out to examine the place where
these few fossil bones had been found
and discovered a wealth of extinct
animal remains. Thus, again, an
accident led to the discovery of what
is now, probably, the most important
site of fossil human remains anywhere
in the world.
Even though I and my colleagues
studied Olduvai Gorge from 1931
onwards and obtained wonderful
collections of artifacts and fossil
animals, we did not find the first
significant fossil human skull until
1959. This was the discovery of Aus¬
tralopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei.
URING the past two years"
my son, Richard Leakey, has been
conducting intensive palaeontological
and archaeological research at the
north east end of Lake Rudolf and he
has found clear evidence of the genus
Homo represented by a number of
specimens. These are completely
contemporary with the fossil fauna,
similar, in most respects, to that from
Kanam West and undoubtedly of
Lower Pleistocene age. Although
Richard Leakey's new Homo finds
have not yet been given scientific
names, their similarity to the original
Kanam mandible is most striking, but
Richard's specimens are much more
complete.
An interesting fact, in connexion
with the discoveries at East Rudolf, is
that in the same series of deposits
there also occur magnificently pre¬
served remains of a robust austra-

lopithecine, who was contemporary
with Homo, and which are more than
half a million years older than Aus¬
tralopithecus (Zinjanthropus) boisei,
from Olduvai. There is, therefore,
clear evidence from Kenya of a
Lower Pleistocene form of the genus
Homo, which is completely contem¬
porary with the australopitheclnes In
Lower Pleistocene times.
These facts inevitably lead us to
a brief discussion on the australo-
pithecines as a whole. Most of the
existing textbooks still place the
genus Australopithecus (including
Zinjanthropus and Paranthropus and
other comparable forms) in the direct
line of ancestry of the genus Homo,
and therefore of Homo sapiens. This
view can no longer be scientifically
maintained.
Undoubtedly, of course, the australo¬
pitheclnes and Homo must have a
common ancestor, somewhere in the
scale between the Upper Miocene
and the Lower Pleistocene, but such
a common ancestor has not yet been
found. The fact, however, that a very
robust australopithecine with a number
of over-specialized characters existed
in the Lower Pleistocene some 2i to
3 million years ago, and was con¬
temporary with Homo, completely
destroys the view that, Australo¬
pithecus, as such, is our direct
ancestor. When a common stock
from which these two types of hominid
are derived is eventually discovered,
it will probably have some characters
of both, but clearly be distinguishable
from either.
It is interesting to note, here, that
in the deposits at East Rudolf of
Lower Pleistocene age which have
now yielded numerous specimens of
Homo, there are stone artifacts which
are very closely similar to the three
found in situ at Kanam West with
the Kanam mandible. These were
published in my book "The Stone
Age Races of Kenya". The preliminary
notes which have been published
concerning the East Rudolf artifacts
show clearly that the genus Homo was
making several different types of

stone tools, during the Lower Pleis¬
tocene In that area.
At Olduvai Gorge a little less than
two million years ago, we have found
further very significant evidence
relative to the origin of the genus
Homo and, therefore, of Homo sapiens.
In Bed I at Olduvai in 1959 we
discovered a very well preserved
skull of an australopithecine which
we described as Zinjanthropus boisei.
At the time of the discovery no
other hominid remains were known
from Olduvai Bed I, while we had
much evidence of the Stone Age
culture known as Oldowan in these
deposits.
Although, therefore, it was accepted
that Zinjanthropus was an australo¬
pithecine, in its physical morphology,
it seemed posible that it might qualify
as a "man", in view of the current
definition of "man" at that time
"Man the Tool-Maker". A few months
later the first fragmentary fossils of
what is now called Homo habilis were
found in deposits of the same age as
Zinjanthropus and also in associa¬
tion with the Oldowan culture. Since
then, many further specimens of this
second type of hominid have been
found at Olduvai and published in
Nature and elsewhere, as it is clear
that they represent the genus Homo,
living during the Lower Pleistocene.
A full description is in preparation
at the present time, in monograph,
and there is no doubt whatsoever
that the morphology of Homo habilis
is much more similar (at least in
respect of the cranial vault) to Homo
sapiens than are the fossil remains
of Homo erectus, the extinct hominid
species first found in Java and China
and later in Africa in Middle Pleis¬
tocene deposits.
HERE seems very little
doubt that Homo habilis lies in the
direct line leading to Homo sapiens.
In all probability the branch which
ended up as Homo erectus diverged
from Homo habilis at least as far back
as the Lower Pleistocene, in view of
the fact of his presence, in the Far
East, as a fully distinct and over-spe¬
cialized species in the Middle Pleis¬
tocene.
Another accidental discovery of
the greatest importance took place
in 1961 the find of remains of
the same type of man as in China
and Java, but twice as old in East
Africa as in the Far East. This time
the accident was due to an error on
the part of one of my staff. The
geologist working with me returned to
camp one day with a draft plane table
map of a certain part of the Gorge.
I looked at it and said, "But you have
left out one long narrow side gully."
He replied, "I have not", and I said,

With his smooth,, sloping brow and canine teeth smaller than those of most apes,
though larger than man's, "Proconsul Africanus" was once thought of as a possible
common ancestor of apes and hominids.
"I am very sorry, but you have;
come over with me tomorrow morning
and I will show you."
When we got to the long and rather
grass and bush filled gully, and he had
had to admit that he was in error, I
looked back towards our camp site
and suddenly on the far side of the
Gorge I saw a very small area of
exposed fossil beds. These were on
the north side of the tongue of land
which separates the main and side
gorges.
Although I had explored Olduvai
on foot since 1931 I knew, at once,
that I had never set foot In that tiny
exposure. But for the error on the
part of my student which had taken
me back to the point from which I saw
it, I might still never have seen it.
It was only visible from that one
point of view. As soon as we got back
to camp, I went off again to locate
this hidden patch of exposures, and
as I walked on to it I almost trod on
a half exposed fossil human skull.
That was the first Homo erectus skull
from Olduvai.
This brings us, inevitably, to a
discussion of the further textbook
view that Homo erectus is a direct
ancestor of Homo sapiens. This view,
too, can no longer be taken seriously
for the following reasons:
The shape of the cranial vault of
all specimens of Homo erectus is
quite dissimilar to the cranial vault
of Homo sapiens while, as already
stated above, the shape of the vault
of Homo habilis, which is much older
in time, is very similar.
Homo erectus exhibits a large
number of highly specialized charac¬
ters which are present in the African
and Far Eastern variants while Homo
habilis has many more Homo sapiens
generalized features.

recently, and the femur shaft associat¬
ed with it, are clearly of a quite
different type from the corresponding
bones of Homo sapiens and it begins
to look doubtful whether the Trinil
femur truly belongs to Homo erectus.
When we go on, therefore, to
discuss the emergence of Homo
sapiens, in the light of the evidence
available in 1972, it becomes entirely
clear that we have to revise our total
picture of how our species came into
being.
HERE can be no doubt
now, at all, that Homo sapiens was
present in the Middle Pleistocene
times in both Europe and Africa; a
fact which was accepted at the Unes¬
co sponsored Conference on the origin
of Homo sapiens, in Paris, in 1969,
when specimens such as the skulls
from Kanjera, Swanscombe and the
new Kibish specimens from southern
Ethiopia were unanimously accepted
as representing Homo sapiens in a
primitive form, but . quite distinctly
sapiens. In fact this species was
present during the Middle Pleistocene
times in areas as far apart as Swans¬
combe in England and Kanjera in
Kenya. It is obvious, therefore, that
an earlier form of Homo sapiens must
occur somewhere In older deposits.
When the fragmentary Kanjera
skulls were found deriving from Middle
Pleistocene deposits and in associa¬
tion with hand axes in 1932, they
were rejected, much as the earlier
Kanam mandible was rejected, and
were placed in what was called a
"Suspense Accouht". When the
Swanscombe skull, in its turn, was
described in 1936 as Homo sapiens,
it was rejected because It seemed too
old for that species. It was only
when the southern Ethiopian skulls
from Kibish were discovered in 1967
that a new concept of the antiquity
of Homo sapiens began to crystallize,
and become accepted.
To conclude this discussion we
may, perhaps, be permitted to try and
distinguish between Homo sapiens
sapiens (what Is known today as
psycho-social man) and Homo sapiens
faber early tool making members of
our species who had not yet achieved
full psycho-social status.
I believe that the beginning of
psycho-social man probably coincides
with the dawn of art, religion, magic
beliefs and speech in terms of abstract
ideas as distinct from mere words
describing material objects. By this
time too man had begun, perhaps,
to be a community dweller as shown
by the vast accumulations of his
artifacts in the caves of the Dordogne
and elsewhere during the' Upper
Pleistocene times.

Cave wall art
comes to man
by
André Leroi-Gourhan

ANDRE LEROI-GOURHAN is one of the out¬
standing world authorities on prehistoric art.
He is professor of prehistory at the Collège
de France and director of the Institute of
Ethnology in Paris. He has directed many
archaeological excavations in Europe and the
Far East. He took part In Unesco's 1969
international symposium on the origin of
Homo sapiens, in Paris (see bibliography
inside back cover).
HE contemporary arts of
Africa and Oceania are often mis¬
takenly labelled "primitive" a serious
error since these arts have had just
as long an evolution as western art.
Traces of this evolution have all too
often vanished, yet those that survive
prove that styles varied over the
centuries and that, although their
"language of forms" differs from that
handed down to us from Ancient
Greece, the so-called "primitive" arts
are in no sense rudimentary.
The same cannot be said for the
oldest prehistoric art whose first
expressions canx be perceived at the
dawn of modern man. This is the true
primitive art.
As other articles in this issue make
clear, the concept of humanity changes
according to whether we consider man
within the span of history or within the
context of the modern age.
In the modern context we find a
single global concept of man; Homo
sapiens, symbolizing the human race.
But within the span of history, things
are quite different. For one or two
million years, perhaps even longer,
thousands of generations of bipeds
succeeded one another, and Homo
sapiens emerged perhaps less than
fifty thousand years ago.
Along this interminable road of
early human development we en¬
counter relatively few works of art.

The cave of Lascaux in S.W. France
boasts some of the finest prehistoric
art of the Magdalenian period (15,000-
9,000 B.C.). Cave artists, who deplet¬
ed hundreds of vigorous and lifelike
animal figures on its walls and ceiling,
knew the animals around them intima¬
tely, and displayed an extraordinary
understanding of and skill in painting
by contrasting black, brown, red and
yellow paints to enhance the realism
of their work (see back cover). Horses
in this Lascaux fresco (centre, beneath
a leaping cow, and at far left) have
been called "Chinese" because of
their similarity to horses seen in Chi¬
nese art 15,000 years later.
At best, one can imagine the pre¬
decessors of modern men, while their
intellect gradually evolved, indulging
an occasional aesthetic impulse by
using their voices, beating out rhythms
and making body movements, the pre¬
cursors of song, music and dance.
As one approaches the types of
men nearer our own Neanderthal
man for Instance one can add to
these embryonic forms of artistic
creation the first signs of engraving,
painting and sculpture.
No structured and decipherable work
of art from these very distant times
has yet been discovered, but we do
know that between 40,000 and 100,000
years ago Neanderthal men handled
natural red ochre and may even have
scratched lines on bone fragments
with the point of a flint.
Unfortunately, there Is little to help
the prehistorian to understand how
the arts were born: only a few traces
of pigment to attest that men were
already interested in colour. Some¬
times, too, the odd-shaped stones and
fossilized shells found among the used
flint tools and remains of game in
early settlements show us that our
nearest forefathers were intrigued by
the spontaneous forms of nature.
This attraction for "natural curiosities"
is deeply anchored in the aesthetic
behaviour of man and has survived
all through history, right up to our own
times.
That Neanderthal men, or the type
of humanity just preceding our own,
had aesthetic needs, as well as the
means of satisfying them, is shown
by the already advanced state of their
technical skills. The shaping of stone
tools creates forms which quickly
acquire regular outlines (ovals, blades
with nearly parallel sides, triangles,
and so on). The first production of
such artificial forms was dictated by
the technique used to prepare the

flint blocks from which the efficient
tool was to emerge.
Although It has been shown that
chance fragments of split flint can be
used as tools, we perceive, during the
first million years of human prehistory,
a search in progress for processes
which would enable artifacts to be
standardized. We find, too, a gradual
evolution of styles which enable us to
identify objects from different periods.
The search for efficient tools and
the need for an economical use of
whatever raw materials came to hand
are the obvious explanation for this
evolution in tool-making. Yet the
truly significant fact is that this
increasing technical progress is in¬
separable from the growing elaboration
of aesthetic forms.
However, until about 40,000 B.C.
one cannot really speak of true works
of art works in which the hands of
men created not merely an object but
also a symbol.
It is difficult to draw clear lines of
demarcation between the successive
stages of man's evolution since, in a
theoretical sense, they are not those
of pre-men, proto-men and finally true
men. From the very beginning we
are dealing with men who gradually

CAVE WALL ART (Continued)
became more and more human, right
down to modern times. The same is
true for art which did not suddenly
appear fully formed, but evolved
gradually through the ages. Neander¬
thal man's interest in the curiosities of
nature or in pigments, therefore mark¬
ed a decisive phase in a continuous
process which reached its full develop¬
ment later.
This development, reflected in the
nature of modern men, is in all
probability linked with the emergence
of language, or at any rate, the
capacity to formulate abstractions.
The hand, like the vocal organs, faith¬
fully expresses thought. And although
it is true that until the appearance of
writing we have no direct witness to
verbal expression (which stems from
the same cerebral centres as manual
expression), nothing prevents us from
supposing that language and technical
skill were interdependent all through
human evolution.
But if from the beginning the hand
gave form to thought through the
craftsman's gestures and left a perma¬
nent "memory-print" of the un¬
conscious search for forms, no trace
of any consciously created shapes
with a symbolic rather than practical
function has been found among the
remains of the men who lived between
500,000 and 1 million years ago.
What the' hand did not translate is
not likely to have existed in the
language; and it seems that any
change had to wait until the long
process of cerebral and cultural
development reached a certain thresh¬
old. Homo sapiens the present
human species crossed that thresh¬
old some forty thousand years ago.
Strikingly enough, ornaments (pierc¬
ed teeth and pendants) appeared at
the same time as the first attempts at
figurative art. It is as though the
emerging modes of expression trans¬
lated at the same time the symbols
of social behaviour (ornaments) and
the symbols of abstract expression
which confirms the link between
artistic and verbal expression. The
aesthetic impulse is always the carrier
of social yearnings, in the fullest
sense. It does not exist for its own
sake because it is a means of express¬
ing or giving form to feelings of
power, love or religious aspiration.
So far as one can judge, the orna¬
mental or figurative prehistoric arts
obeyed the same rules as later arts.
The exact date of their emergence is
difficult to fix, partly because we are
far from knowing the prehistory of all

the regions of the world, but above
all because we are dealing with an
evolutionary per¡od¡ not a particular
moment in time. Behind innovation
there is always an inventor; but
behind the inventor looms a whole
social and historical background.
And when, as In the present case, the
facts cover many small stages spread
out over thousands of years, it would
be an oversimplification to speak of
the "invention" of painting or sculp¬
ture.
Our knowledge covers the final
period of European Neanderthal man
and the end of the last glacial period
perhaps from 50,000 B.C. and
certainly up 9,000 B.C. The begin¬
nings were extremely slow; and more
than half the period was gone before
the creation of the great paintings or
low-reliefs of the western European
caves.
During the second half of the
period, however, there was an extra¬
ordinary abundance of decorated
caves in Spain, France, Italy and even
the Urals, and a profusion of sculp¬
ture and engraving all the way from
the Atlantic to Lake Baikal in Siberia.
Works from this long initial period
of artistic evolution will certainly be
discovered in other parts of the world.
But up to now the thousands of paint¬
ings and engravings discovered in
Africa or southern Asia, for instance,
belong to more recent periods. This
does not, of course, make them any
less valuable or significant.
A very important point should be
noted concerning prehistoric art: its
technical means reached their fullest
development from the very beginning.
This is something that radically dis¬
tinguishes artistic creation from
technical invention. Hunting, fishing,
weaving, clothing and home-making
skills slowly evolved up to the present.
One cannot imagine prehistoric man
inventing the aeroplane on the basis
of the scientific knowledge offered
him by his own society. But 'with
coloured earths and with flint tools
whose cutting power is superior to
most metal ones, the artist was
immediately in possession of all his
means of expression.
Time brought new processes like
mosaics or oil painting, new colours
like greens or blues, as well as various
nuances in the execution; but from
the very first the artist could give his
whole measure In forms, in contrasts
of colour and in relief . . . The position
is therefore very different for art than
for technology.

HORSE'S HEAD IN MINIATURE

Magdalenian period on a tiny piece of reindeer antler, this horse's

gination can be disregarded when one
considers the material equipment at
his disposal. His level of achievement
corresponds to the stage at which his
society has arrived, according to its
period and geographical situation.
For art, the dependence on the
technical and social environment is of
another order. Crude works and
those which reach full mastery of
expression can be found in the same
society, simultaneously or succes¬
sively.
Where engraving and sculpture are
concerned, the problem of tools does
not arise. Flint is perfectly adequate
whether for cutting or carving bone,
lumps of soft stone or the walls. of
caves and rock overhangs. And it
is even easier'to trace shapes with a
finger on wet clay or to model them
in the same material. So such works
are found from the beginning. Model¬
ling and sculpture in low-relief do not
appear until relatively late, however,
probably not before 15,000 B.C. But
the search for "three dimensional"
effects is a dominant trait in the
evolution of prehistoric art.
In the case of "hollowed out" works
of art, one point deserves special
mention. For practical reasons, low-
relief is only found in hollows lit by
daylight. The designs must have
taken many weeks to execute; and in
deep caves this would have required
some form of lighting, as well as
prolonged stays underground.
But In some caves (for instance at
Font de Gaume in the Dordogne), one
comes across an expeditive process
for rendering relief which reveals the
use of an astonishing technical knack.
After the figure has been traced with
a line a few millimetres deep, the Inner
border has been rounded off, and with
side lighting this gives a striking
illusion of relief.
LPART from wall figures,
prehistoric artists have left numerous
engravings on stone tablets or bones
and antlers. Certain objects like the
tips of weapons are decorated with
simple geometrical patterns; and spear
throwers often bear highly elaborated
animal figures.
Small sculptures in the round in the
form of human and animal figures were
also made. In certain regions, such as
Czechoslovakia or the U.S.S.R., where
cave art is unknown, hundreds of
statuettes carved in soft stone or
modelled in clay have been found,

of horses and remdeer, chamois and bison, lions, bears, mammoths and other animals shows that they were the
work of experienced artists. This shaggy-haired mammoth figures on a painted panel of beasts in the Pech-

CAVE WALL ART (Continued trom page 34)
The palette of the Palaeolithic painter
greatly exaggerated forms, are com¬
mon from the Atlantic coast of the
Pyrenees to Lake Baikal in Siberia.
The development of painting is
equally remarkable. As has been
shown, colours were in use very early
on. By 35,000 B.C., prehistoric man
knew how to employ fire to oxydize
natural ochres and change their
shades; and the whole range of
yellows and purplish reds was known
and used. Black was supplied by
natural manganese or charcoal.
ECHNIQUES for applying
paint were no less varied. When the
ochre or manganese was sufficiently
firm and friable, true crayons were
cut, which served to decorate flat
surfaces. Hard colours were ground
on a palette of rough stone; and both
these and natural powders were
applied in various ways according to
the nature of the background or the
effect sought after.
Sometimes the pigments were
stippled in close dots, dabbed on with
the tip of the finger or printed with a
small stick; sometimes continuous
lines of varying width were drawn in
the same way or even with true
brushes.
Occasionally, a special method was
otherwise have discouraged artistic
efforts. The most striking case is the
main part of the Lascaux grotto (Dor-
dogne, France). The surface of the
white calcite walls is lumpy, like a
cauliflower, and ill-suited to the usual
painting techniques.
The Lascaux artists, some 15,000
years ago, solved the problem by
stencilling on the powdered colours
with the help of a fur pad, giving a
dappled effect. As these blurred
dabs made it difficult to obtain a clear
outline, the painter masked the outer
edge of the figures with a strip of
bark or leather, moving it along as he
advanced.
This extremely ingenious process
required considerable manual dex¬
terity; and it confirms the feeling one
has when one studies the great
artistic achievements of the French
and Spanish caves: the fresco artists
must have been specialists, at least
part of whose activity was devoted to
decorating underground sanctuaries.
As was mentioned earlier, the most
original aspect of prehistoric cave
wall art is perhaps the search for a
three-dimensional effect. As well
as low-relief sculptures and carv¬
ings with rounded inner edges, two
other techniques were developed.
The first is common to the various
painting and engraving processes. It
consists in taking advantage of natural
irregularities in the wall by placing
the work in such a way that a bump is
used for a flank, the edge of a rock
for a bone or a small knob for paws
with colours or engraved lines
stressing the natural volumes and
making them explicit.
The second solution is to vary the
thickness of the line or use shading
or hatchings. This method is used
with great skill at Altamira near San¬
tander, in northern Spain towards
11 or 12,000 B.C. and at Niaux (Ariège,
France). It puts the frescoes in the
depths of these caves on a level with
the finest works produced by the great
artists of historical times.
Can one indeed justifiably des¬
cribe as "primitive", an art which
already has thousands of years of
development behind it? It is reassuring
to remind ourselves that at a time
when technology was rudimentary and
human life still at a subsistence level,
thousands of years before agriculture,
metal-working and writing brought
into being the civilizations of antiquity,
man had found ways of giving full
expression to his artistic thought and
by the same token to his humanity.
Ancient rock carvings have been
found In many parts of the world.
This rock engraving is from Lake
Onega, 200 km east of Leningrad,
where archaeologists have uncover¬
ed numerous traces of Neolithic peo¬
ples who lived on the lake's shores
and Islands: tools, and rock-cut ani¬
mal figures including many reindeer.

Many of my zoological colleagues,
for instance, are principally interested
in analysing the background of the
non-human primates, the lemurs, mon¬
keys or apes. But I am an anthro¬
pologist which means that man is the
central theme of my research so It Is
not surprising that I am primarily in¬
terested in the appearance of those
structural and functional features by
which we characterize man today. This
being so we must clarify our ideas and
decide just what we should be look¬
ing for in the primate fossil record.
First of all we must examine the
nature of our criteria and select those
characters that are unique to modern
man and can truly be called his
"hallmarks" (*). There are quite a
number of characters that we might
choose but, bearing in mind that our
source material is limited to fossil
bones and teeth, the range is naturally
rather restricted. The possession of
speech and language Is the most

unfortunately it leaves no trace in
ancient bones.
One can make all sorts of in¬
ferences that speech evolved at such-
and-such a time but there is no scrap
of direct evidence to support such an
assertion. The ability to speak lies,
first of all, in the shape and mus¬
culature of the mouth, tongue, soft
palate, pharynx and larynx; and
secondly, in the centres of the cortex,
or outer shell, of the brain which
govern the muscular control of the
various "soft" parts mentioned above.
Although many ingenious suggestions
have been put forward none as far as
we know can help us to recognize
the capacity for speech from a study
of bones.
There are numerous cultural
phenomena which we would regard
as significant hallmarks but, again, we
cannot use them because they leave
no physical evidence behind. Be¬
haviour itself does not fossilize but the
extra-corporeal accessories of be¬
haviour do.

making behaviour can be identified.
Much as a modern picnic site can
reveal to an intelligent inquirer all he
needs to know about the habits and
social status of the picnickers, so liv¬
ing floors of early man with their
hearths, their animal remains, their
wall-paintings, their burials and so
on can be read and interpreted by
archaeologists.
Unfortunately the background to man
that we are committed to investigate
extends many millions of years further
back in time when no living floors and
no artifacts existed. Apart from the
evidence of stone or bone tools as
supplements to our understanding of
human dexterity we shall not be
leaning very heavily on the evidence
of "fossil behaviour". What, then, are
to be our criteria?
When we think about man and
compare him with non-man one of the
first things that strikes us is that he
stands upright and walks on two legs.
But this is not nearly a precise
enough definition to exclude the many
non-human primates who are also cap¬
able of upright bipedalism. Nor does it
exclude, for example, the bears. For a
more exact criterion we must draw
upon our knowledge of the bio¬
mechanics of human walking.
Human walking is a highly complex
affair. This is not the place to stuff
you with technical details like a
Strasbourg goose with rich food, but
to ask you to accept the simplified
but nonetheless valid conclusion
that modern man shows a unique
method of walking which we call
striding. Striding involves the muscles
and the joints of the vertebral column,
the pelvis, the leg and the foot in a
complicated and precisely integrated
series of manoeuvres. An alternative
term for striding is heel-toe walking.
We are now in a position to formulate
our first hallmark: Man stands upright
and when walking habitually uses a
bipedal, striding gait.
The second characteristic that
strikes us is the dexterity of the human
hand which is infinitely capable,
exquisitely delicate but, at the same
time, alarmingly powerful powerful
enough to cleave a brick in half with
a karate chop, or to tear a city
telephone directory into two equal
parts.
The essential component of the
human hand Is its opposable thumb,
which provides the means for grasp¬
ing objects with strength (the power
grip) or with delicacy (the precision
grip). The opposable thumb is there¬
fore an obvious hallmark, but un¬
fortunately it Is not unique to man; all
living Old World monkeys and apes
possess opposable thumbs.
'NCE again we must draw
upon our knowledge of the functional
anatomy of man's hand to set us on
the right track. Man's precision grip
is much more sophisticated than any
monkey's or ape's; when he places
his forefinger and thumb together in
a precision grip he is employing the
two most acutely sensitive areas In
his whole body. The sensory input
from these small areas provides the
neurological basis for the sort of skill
that a watchmaker, a plastic surgeon
or an assembler of micro-circuits
possesses.
Sometime 'ago, In order to provide
a means of quantifying the precision
grip of primates, I introduced a simple
ratio called the opposability index to
express the relative lengths of the
forefinger and thumb. The oppo¬
sability index of men is 65. The score
for a chimpanzee is 43 and for' a
baboon, which approaches nearest to
man in this respect, it is 57. So now
we are in a position to formulate the
second hallmark: man possesses en
opposable thumb whose length is
approximately 65 per cent the length
of his forefinger.
Man's debt
to the tree
To his ancient ancestors who were tree-living
creatures, man owes his mobility of hand,
opposable thumb and the upright posture
of at least the upper part of his body. Left,
Gibbon apes still swing happily from tree
to tree, but, like man, the gorilla (right) is
now basically a ground-living animal, though
his lower limbs have not adapted to true
bipedalism and he still supports himself with
his knuckles when walking. Through evolu¬
tionary changes in the pelvis, man and his
ancestors adopted a bipedal, striding gait,
better adapted to ground-living. Drawing (far
right), the pelvic girdle of Australopithecus
as compared with that of a chimpanzee.
The third feature that strikes us
about man is that his brain is large
and rounded; but of course brains do
not fossilize and so we can only make
deductions about the brain from the
study of its container the brain-box.
Unfortunately, apart from overall shape
and size, there is no means of deter¬
mining the nature of the brain by a
simple examination of fossil skulls.
What is more, size itself is a some¬
what misleading indicator because
it is naturally variable within a
species; for example among mod¬
ern human populations the brain
volume ranges from 950-2000 cubic
centimetres. The average volume is
about 1400 cc. Brain size is related
to body size bigger animals have
bigger brains and, in some way that
we don't fully understand, to in¬
telligence.
Nevertheless, brain size is a
valuable guide to the palaeontologist
who is attempting to follow the track
of man through time. From the
earliest pre-human stages to the final
flowering of the human family
expressed In the species Homo sapiens,
a steady trend towards enlargement
is seen. Here, then, is the basis of
our third hallmark which can be
expressed thus: man, relative to his
body size, has a large, rounded brain
that may exceed 1400 cc in volume.
Finally, we notice that man
possesses small, even teeth arranged
in an elegant parabolic form in his
upper and lower jaw. The human
teeth, like those of all living primates,
are of four types: incisors, canines,
premolars and molars. Together in
both jaws they total 32, a number
characteristic of all Old World
monkeys and apes but not New World
monkeys or prosimians.
Unlike the apes, man's teeth are
all more or less the same vertical
length; the canines which form
massive elongated and projecting
teeth in the apes are small, short and
discrete in man. Human molars bear

low, rounded cusps In contrast to the
sharp, prominent cusps of apes and
monkeys. The human third molar in
both jaws is often small and Is fre¬
quently absent, whereas in apes the
third molar is often the largest of the
series.
There are many other differences
but these few should be adequate for
the purpose of defining the fourth hall¬
mark as follows: man's teeth are small
and are arranged in the jaws in a pa¬
rabolic curve, the third molar being the
smallest of the series and the canines
non-projecting.
wITH these hallmarks in
mind we ought to be able to pick up
the trail of man during our journey
through the past. The trip will be
rather like travelling by train between
two cities a thousand miles apart.
Most railway systems are very com¬
plicated affairs with numerous junc¬
tions, switching points, branch lines
and dead-end terminals, so we have
to constantly be on our guard that we
do not become shunted along long-
forgotten tracks that simply finish up
at the end of nowhere at a pair of
rusty buffers.
There is a very real danger of this
happening because evolution frequent¬
ly involves a form of mimicry as a re¬
sult of which similar characters crop
up in unrelated or distantly related
forms. We have already seen for
example that walking on two legs Is
not uniquely the possession of man.
This form of mimicry is more
properly termed parallelism and the
theory behind it is that, given a
similar set of environmental opportu¬
nities, animals with a common ances¬
try will tend to evolve in a similar way.
The best example of parallelism in
primate evolution is that the monkeys
of the New World and the Old World,
which are related through a common
ancestor living 40 million or so years
ago, share so many physical charac¬
ters that it is hard for the average
person to tell them apart even seeing
them side by side in a zoo.
Man has a double ecological heri¬
tage. His earliest ancestors were tree-
living creatures well adapted to mov¬
ing, feeding, mating and sleeping high
above the ground in tropical forests.
His later forebears were ground-livers
spending their lives among tropical
woodlands and grasslands In com¬
petition with the myriads of ground-
based mammals including the large,
predatory, carnivores.
His two phases are complementary;
without an arboreal background he
could never have succeeded on the
ground. He possesses neither the
fleetness of the impala nor the killer
power of the leopards, cheetahs and
lions; but he has, through his arboreal
background, acquired talents which
were of infinitely greater value.
He could run on the ground and he
could climb trees; he could evade dan¬
gers by subtle manoeuvres undreamed
of by the instinct-dominated predators
and with his emancipated hands he
could use weapons and tools to pro¬
tect himself and to obtain food. Hands
were far more efficient than the hooves
of his ungulate competitors. Para¬
doxical as it may seem, man's success
as a ground-living primate was entire¬
ly due to his arboreal heritage.
The earliest ancestors of the pri¬
mates were among the first mammals
to make their appearance. At this
stage, some 70 million years ago, pri¬
mates-to-be were small, long-nosed,
ground-living animals rooting among
the leaves of the forest floor for their
insect food, and distinguishable only
by obscure characters of the teeth and
skull from the other long-nosed insec¬
tivorous creatures.
With hindsight, some authorities feel
they can recognize these primates-to-
be even though they possessed none
of the arboreal characters by which
we now recognize the order. They
may well be right, but to those of us
interested In living primates (including
man) the order, effectively, came into
being when the primates started to
live in trees.
Plesiadapis ¡s a most unprimate-like
primate and is totally deficient in arbo¬
real adaptations, while Smilodectes
and Notharctus which appeared a few
million years later were already
advanced tree-climbers.
Arboreal characters can be briefly
summarized as follows:
Mobility of the hands and feet and
particularly of the thumb and big toe
which are well separated from the
other digits and, in some primates,
capable of being opposed.
Replacement of sharp claws by flat¬
tened nails, associated with the de¬
velopment of sensitive pads on the tips
of the digits.
A shortening of the .snout associat¬
ed with a reduction in the apparatus
and the functions of smell.
Convergence of the eyes towards
the front of the face associated with
the development of stereoscopic
vision.
H A large brain relative to body size.
An upright posture which may be
confined to the upper part of the body
in some but applies throughout in
others.
The lemur-like Eocene family the
Adapidas (including the genera No¬
tharctus and Smilodectes) possesses
most of these arboreal adaptations:
nails had replaced claws and sens¬
ory pads were developing on the finger
tips, the eyes were converging and
the snout was shortening, the brain
was relatively large, and the loco¬
motion pattern Involved an upright
posture of the upper part of the body
while in the lower part the hips and
knees were acutely flexed.

JOURNEY OF THE PRIMATES (Continued)
When the ape line and human line diverged
44
This last feature, alone, merits our
particular interest because the upright
posture is one of the hallmarks we
are committed to trace. Later forms
such as Necrolemur, an early Euro¬
pean tarsier-Iike primate, and Hemia-
codon, a North American form, show a
similar postural pattern.
The next recognizable stage in the
fossil record is seen during the geolo¬
gical epoch known as the Oligocène;
at present the ancestor-descendant
linkages between the Oligocène and
Eocene primates have not been prov¬
ed. Most of our Information about the
Oligocène primates comes from a
region of Egypt called the Fayum, now
desert but once covered with dense
tropical forest.
Between 25-35 million years ago the
Fayum was the home of an extra¬
ordinary variety of ape and monkey¬
like creatures. Some, like Parapithe-
cus, were probably destined to become
true monkeys; some, like Aeolopithe-
cus, to become "half-apes" like the
gibbons, and some, like Aegyptopithe-
cus, to become true apes like the chim¬
panzee and the gorilla.
It has even been suggested very
tentatively that one of these creatures
called Propliopithecus represents the
earliest known member of the human
lineage. Both Propliopithecus and
Aegyptopithecus, of which only teeth
or jaws are known, show some of the
characters which anticipate the human
condition. Aegyptopithecus, while
possessing some human-like dental
characters, also has features which
are strongly reminiscent of later apes.
This raises an important point: the
relationship of man and apes. Nearly
everyone would agree that their rela¬
tionship in terms of anatomical struc¬
ture and physiological and biochemical
functions is extremely close. The
principal Issue is how close? When
did the ape line and the human line
diverge?
There are at least four schools of
thought which we can call the "late-
late", the "late", the "early" and the
"early-early". Personally, I favour the
late school but there is something to
be said for the early school which
would hold that the human lineage
dates back to Propliopithecus, some
30 million years ago.
The late school favours the early
Miocene species from Kenya, East
Africa, called Proconsul africanus (or
something very like it) as a likely can¬
didate. We know a little bit about the
gait, the skull and the teeth of P. afri¬
canus. The gait was quadrupedal and
therefore provides no particular hint
of future bipedalism; the hands are ra¬
ther human-like In proportion but the
evidence of an advanced type of pre¬
cision grip is absent; the opposability
index has been estimated at 56. The
brain is still rather primitive but was
quite large in terms of body-size, and
the teeth like those of Aegyptopithe¬
cus are ape-like rather than man¬
like, but not so completely specialized
that one could not envisage an evo¬
lutionary reversal to a human-like form.
During Miocene times volcanic act¬
ivity, rift-valley .formation and moun¬
tain-building were in full swing. One
of two consequences of this orogeny
and the coincidental cooling of the
earth's surface, which had been stead¬
ily proceeding throughout the Tertiary
era, was the spread of grasslands at
the expense of forests. Grasslands
(or savannas) offered new evolution¬
ary opportunities to a variety of mam¬
mals, including the expanding popula¬
tion of primates in the rapidly shrink¬
ing forest zones.
A few primate stocks, including the
ancestors of man and the ancestors of
the modern baboons, evidently react¬
ed to the challenge of the changing
environment. In this way new hori¬
zons were opened up for our remote
human ancestors, and for the evolution
of the critical hallmarks of mankind.
The earliest human ancestor as we
see it at present was a creature called
Ramapithecus known from north-west
India and East Africa. Our material
evidence for the potential humanity
of Ramapithecus is slight and consists
only of Jaws and teeth but is, neverthe¬
less, very revealing.
Ramapithecus has a distinctly man¬
like tooth form lacking all the ape-like
characters seen In Aegyptopithecus
zeuxis and Proconsul africanus. The
dental arcade Is rounded, the canines
are small and the molar teeth do not

in the apes. Ramapithecus lived bet-

ween 12-14 million years ago but of
course his ancestors may have evolved
several million years before this date.
The next recognizable stage in the
human lineage started, apparently, at
least 4-5 million years ago. There is
fragmentary evidence that pre-human
creatures belonging to the genus Aus¬
tralopithecus existed in two areas of
East Africa, called Kanapoi and Lotha-
gam. We pick up the trail of these
near-men two million years later In the
area of Lake Rudolf, again in South
Africa, and in Tanzania at Olduvai
Gorge; in all these regions they are
most prolific. The early (Lothagam
and Kanapoi) australopithecines do
not tell us very much, but the later
forms in East and South Africa show
many of the characteristics of the gait,
brain-size and tooth form that we are
searching for.
Australopithecines are generally re¬
garded as near-men. Technically, un¬
der the curious rules of current an¬
thropology, they do not qualify for the
accolade of human beings, but at Ol¬
duvai Gorge 1.75 million years ago
some of us accept the fact that the
zoological genus Homo (man) first
made his appearance.- His way of life
appears to have been that of a scaven¬
ger, a hunter of small game, and a tool-
maker.
Homo habilis, as this early man is
called, was a bipedal walker and prob¬
ably a "strider"; his brain was still
small by modern standards but bigger
than his predecessors', and his teeth
showed a slight advance on the teeth
of the australopithecines. His hands
were of a human type but lacked the
refinements of precision grip possess¬
ed by modern man.
Homo habilis was succeeded in the
fossil record by Homo erectus, known
from South-East Asia (Java), Asia
(China), Europe (West Germany) and
both North and East Africa. Early
Homo erectus (from Java) had a big¬
ger brain than Homo habilis (H. habilis,
656 cc; H. erectus 935 cc) and the later
manifestations of this species, from
Peking for example, showed a maxi¬
mum brain-size of 1,225 cc.
IIN spite of this large brain
volume, Homo erectus possesses a
skull of primitive and easily recogni¬
zable shape. His gait is assumed to
have been both bipedal and striding.
The form of his hands is unknown, so
the only guide to the extent of his
dexterity are the tools that he made.
These fall broadly into the class of
"power tools", stone artifacts of simple
construction designed for relatively
crude purposes such as killing and
skinning animals, cutting wood and
pounding vegetable products. It has
been shown by experiment that these
could have been constructed and used
in the absence of an advanced form
of precision grip.
Perhaps it was an increase in brain-
size that stimulated the evolutionary
improvement of the hand, but perhaps
It was the other way about. Anyhow
it seems highly probable that the com¬
plexity of the brain, the precision
capabilities of the hand and the
evolution of "precision tools" were
closely interlinked.
Exactly where and when Homo erec¬
tus passed the baton in the human re¬
lay-race to Homo sapiens is not
known. It may have happened in dif¬
ferent parts of the world, at different
times, and in different ways. There
is no saying which geographic popula¬
tion of early men did it first.
With the evolution of Homo sapiens,
which is dated somewhere between
250,000-400,000 years ago, our railway
journey Is almost at an end and we
are entering the suburbs of the metro¬
polis. Most of us can begin to put on
our overcoats and lift our cases down
from the rack. The engine-driver has
read the signals correctly, the signal¬
man has done his Job and our work
is virtually over over for some, but
not for all. The complexities of the sub¬
urban system are still to be nego¬
tiated, and for certain experts this part
of the trip ¡s a matter of deep concern.
They are the specialists In the
growth of agriculture, of citizenship, of
social and political systems, of the
spread of populations and the Inter¬
mingling of genes, processes which
are leading us slowly but inexorably
towards the eventual unification of
mankind in a single biological and
cultural entity. Only when the train
comes to a final stop at the terminus
at some future date will these peo¬
ple reach for their overcoats and suit¬
cases and dismount.

ANTARCTICA, SIBERIA
OR ACROSS THE PACIFIC...
Where did
the first Americans
come from?
by Juan Comas
W,
46
HERE did the first inhabi¬
tants of America come from? At what
time in history did their immigration to
the American continent begin? These
are the first questions we must ask our¬
selves before seeking to determine
the biological and cultural traits of the
first settlers in America.
I have used the terms "immigration"
and "settlers" on purpose, thereby
explicitly rejecting the belief com¬
monly held at the end of the last cen¬
tury and in the first decades of the
present century, according to which
the New World saw man evolve inde¬
pendently from earlier forms as in the
Old World, and hence that early forms
of man existed in the Americas many
hundreds of thousands of years ago.
This is the theory held by the so-
called "autochthonlsts" who based
their beliefs on the discovery of bone
remains on the American continent
attributederroneously to hominids
less evolved than Homo sapiens and
unearthed In geological strata judged
to be also erroneously much older
than has since proved the case.
Going counter to this belief is the
fact that only the less evolved pri-
JUAN COMAS, born In Spain and now a
citizen of Mexico, is internationally known
for his work as an anthropologist. He is
head of the department of anthropology of
the University of Mexico, and editor of the
authoritative 'Anales de Antropología', pub¬
lished by the university in Spanish. He
was for many years vice-president of the
International Union for Anthropological and
Ethnological Sciences, and was a member
of both committees of experts on racial
questions set up by Unesco In 1949 and
1955. (See bibliography inside back cover.)
mates, that is, lemuroid fossils corres¬
ponding to the Eocene period at the
beginning of the Tertiary Era (some
55 million years ago) have ever been
found in America. As to the present-
day living species, the New World
comprises only the simpler types of
simians, known scientifically as platyr-
rhines, but there is no trace of the
higher types of primates, called
catarrhines, which include apes and
the anthropoids.
As for the ancestors of Homo sap¬
iens, such as the pre-hominids and
hominids, they are completely un¬
known to the Americas though they
have been found in Africa, Asia and
Europe. All of the prehistoric bone
remains found on the American con¬
tinent indisputably belong to modern
man and hence are much much more
recent than any of the more primitive
forms such as Homo erectus or Nean¬
derthal Man discovered elsewhere.
Many suppositions have been ad¬
vanced over the years (and passion¬
ately argued) to explain where the
first settlers in America came from.
The list includes the Phoenicians, He¬
brews, Etruscans, Egyptians, Sumer¬
ians and Aryans, but no scientifically
valid proof for any of these supposi¬
tions has been forthcoming, nor, for
that matter, for the existence of the
imaginary, fabulous Atlantis as the
birthplace of the first Americans.
Certain writers in the 19th century
and even in the present century took
it for granted that all the Indians of
America stemmed from a common bio¬
logical stock. This gave rise to the
common saying that: "all Indians are
alike in colour and other features.
When you've seen an Indian from one
region you have seen them all."
This was based on the Idea that all
the migrants to the New World were
Mongols of Asian origin who had
crossed the Bering Straits at different
epochs going back no earlier than
20,000 to 25,000 years ago. Accord¬
ing to this hypothesis, the physical and
cultural differences observed among
the Indians of the Americas can be
explained in two ways: partly by the
different degrees of biological evolu¬
tion of the migratory groups that cros¬
sed north-east Asia in the course of
thousands of years; partly by the dif¬
fering environments of the various
regions of America the settlers estab¬
lished themselves in.
Other scientists, however, are of the
opinion that from remote antiquity

THE FIRST AMERICANS (Continued)
Deep in the heart of Texas 40,000 years ago
48
there coexisted on American soil
human groups of different physical
characteristics and of different origins.
All the scientists who support this
"multi-racial" thesis nonetheless
unanimously agree that the Mon¬
goloid element that crossed the Ber¬
ing Straits from Siberia at different
periods of migration by far dominates
all other groups.
According to Paul Rivet, former
director of the Paris Musée de
l'Homme, the populations of pre-Col¬
umbian America are the result of mi¬
grations to the continent of four racial
groups: Mongols and Eskimos via the
Bering Straits, Australoids and Malay¬
an-Polynesians across the Pacific.
Rivet based his conclusions not only
on the findings of physical anthropo¬
logy by studying data on physical
and other characteristics of Indian
groups from southern South America
and those of Indians from certain
areas in Brazil, Baja California and
Ecuador, but also on cultural and lin¬
guistic analogies with population
groups in Oceania.
A. Mendes Correa, of Portugal, ad¬
vanced the theory that an Australo-
Tasmanian human element populated
America not by sailing across the
Pacific but by marching across An¬
tarctica, island-hopping across the
string of archipelagos between Tas¬
mania and Tierra del Fuego at the
southern tip of South Americal
Mendes Correa has indeed demons¬
trated that between 15,000 and 6,000
B.C., Antarctica was free of glacial ice
and actually had a temperate climate
at the time. Obviously, no archaeo¬
logical proof exists to confirm this
Antarctic migration hypothesis, and it
will be extremely difficult, not to say
impossible, to uncover any evidence
with the permanent ice cap now cover¬
ing all of the Antarctic continent.
According to Jose Imbelloni of Ar¬
gentina, one cannot truly understand
the racial and cultural history of early
America without taking into account
the contribution of the peoples of
south-east Asia. Imbelloni conclu¬
des that seven distinct racial groups
migrated to America : Tasmanoids,
Australoids, Melanesianoids, proto-
Indonesians, Indonesians, Mongoloids
and Eskimos. In his works he descri¬
bes and delineates a total of 11 types
of Amerindians.
More recently (1951) Joseph Birdsell
of the U.S.A. sharply criticized the
contradictory views concerning the
population of the Americas put for¬
ward by various multi-racial exponents
such as G. Taylor, R.B. Dixon, H.S.
Gladwin, E.A. Hooton, E.W. Count, F.
Weidenreich and J. Imbelloni. He
advanced his own hypothesis that
America had been settled by a mixture
of two racial groups, Mongols and
"Amurians" or archaic Caucasoids who
had also reached the New World via
north-east Asia.
As proof of this dual origin, Birdsell
claims to have found "Amurian" traits
in contemporary American Indians,
among the Cahuillas of the interior of
Lower California and among the Yuki
and Porno of the northern Californian
coast. But if the Indians of North and
South America were indeed the result
of the mixture of only the two Mongo¬
loid and Amurian strains, there ought
to be a much greater similarity in
blood groups than has actually been
observed, particularly as regards the
A-B-0 and M-N groups.
There have been repeated efforts to
establish similarities and Indeed possi¬
ble contacts between the'redskins"
of the Atlantic seabord of the United
States and the prehistoric Caucasoid
man of the Cro-Magnon type who peo¬
pled western Europe at the beginning
of the Upper Palaeolithic or Old Stone
Age. Such claims cannot be dis¬
missed since they do contain an ele¬
ment of possibility but no proof of any
kind has yet been forthcoming.
ROM the above we can
summarize our conclusions concerning
the first inhabitants of the American
continent as follows:
1) No authochtonous human popula¬
tion ever existed in America.
2) Never was there nor is there now
any biologically homogeneous Amerin¬
dian type. .
3) The overwhelming population mi¬
gration consisted of Mongoloids.
4) There is still doubt and debate as
to what and how many other human
types also populated America, the
most widely accepted hypotheses
being 2 (Birdsell), 4 (Rivet) and 7
(Imbelloni).
The advocates of each of these
hypotheses naturally explain the
physical and other differences between
the various types of Amerindians in
different ways, and no definite conclu¬
sion can, of course, be reached until
more extensive data is obtained.
However, the large number of arch¬
aeological explorations carried out in
recent years in various parts of the
Americas has unearthed a rich store
of stone implements and other objects
as well as, to a lesser extent, fossi¬
lized human remains which, with our
modern dating techniques including
Carbon-14 now permit us to establish
with relative certainty when man first
appeared in America and a chronolo¬
gical time-table of his presence there.
Thus we now know that man was
present in the United States, for exam¬
ple, as early as 38,000 B.C. at a site
found at Lewisville, Texas. Other pre¬
historic sites have been clocked at
27,650 B.C. (Santa Rosa, California);
19.500 B.C. (La Jolla, California); 8,505
B.C. (Gypsum Cave, Nevada); 7,883
B.C. (Plainview Site, Texas); and 6,274
B.C. (Allen Site, Nebraska). In each
case we must allow a few hundred
years or more plus or minus as is
customary for C-14 readings. The
people who lived in this area between
40,000 years ago and 8,000 years ago
were all hunter-gatherers.
The oldest human settlement in
Mexico has been found to be Tlapa-
coya in Mexico State where a disc¬
shaped file and an obsidian knife have
been unearthed dating back to
20,200 B.C. (plus or minus 2,600 years)
and 21,150 B.C. (1,950 years) respecti¬
vely. Later prehistoric sites are also
known, of course, which show that
they too belonged to hunter-gatherers.
Here are a few examples of datings
from South America (plus or minus
years are omitted): crude stone tool
industries in Venezuela (14,375 B.C.
and 12,275 B.C.); cultural remains in
Lagoa Santa, Brazil (8,024 B.C.); pre-
ceramic lithic culture in Lauricocha,
Peru (7,566 B.C.); Inithuasi Grotto at
San Luis, Argentina with a pre-ceramic
lithic industry (6,068 B.C.); a cultural
complex on the high terraces of the
Gallegos river in southern Patagonia
dating from between 10,000 and
7,000 B.C.; excavations in Chile
(9,380 B.C.) and elsewhere in southern
Patagcmia (8,760 to 6,700 B.C.).
From the above examples a very
interesting observation can be made,
namely, that as we proceed southward
the datings of the hunting and gather¬
ing cultures are less ancient. Is this
a confirmation of the thesis that the
settlers of America came exclusively
by way of the Bering Straits and that
South America was therefore peo¬
pled many millenia later than North
America? I believe it is still too early
to say and we must wait for further
research and investigations.
IIT is generally agreed, for
the moment, that the oldest date of
38,000 to 40,000 years ago corres¬
ponds to the beginnings of the warm¬
ing up period of the last Ice Age in
North America (known as the Wiscon¬
sin glaciation) when it was possible to
cross from eastern Siberia to Alaska
and thereby reach the more temperate
regions of southern North America.
Culturally, the first hunter-gatherers
evolved until they became sedentary
groups after learning to cultivate
plants and domesticate animals. This
was a slow and gradual process, but
we have evidence of prehistoric sites
where hunter-gatherer tribes were
simultaneously engaged in the cultiva¬
tion of squash, chile beans and later,
maize.

CAVE DWELLERS OF THE AMERICAS. Dating by modern scientific methods of recently discov¬
ered stone implements and fossil human remains in various parts of the Americas show that man
was present in the United States as early as 38,000 B.C., in Mexico by about 20,000 B.C. and as
far south as Patagonia between 10,000 and 7,000 B.C. Many finds have been made in caves
once occupied by Stone Age man. Photo shows a more recent site, known as the "Mummy
Cave" In the grandiose setting of Chelly Canyon In the state of Arizona. Here hundreds of cave
dwellings and graves containing mummies have been found showing that it was occupied by man
right down to historical times. Ruins at entrance date from later pre-Columbian Indian times.
Such agricultural sites have been
found at Tamaulipas, Mexico, dating
back to between 7,500 and 5,500 B.C.,
at Sierra Madre, Mexico (4,500 -
2,500 B.C. and 5,000-3,000 B.C.). In
the Tehuaca area of the State of Pue¬
bla in Mexico several prehistoric sites
have been unearthed offering definite
proof of the existence of agriculture
between 6,000 and 5,500 B.C.
In New Mexico (USA) agricultural
levels have been found at a site
known as Bat Cave dating back to
about 3,300 B.C. while in the Peruvian
Andes agricultural complexes dating
between 4,700 and 3,000 B.C. have
been found at Huaca Prieta, Nazoa,
Paracas, Chuica, and other sites.
The evolution from the hunter-gath¬
erer stage to agriculture occurred In
America independently of the same
development in the Old World. Re¬
search In plant genetics, ecology and
ethno-history as well as chronological
datings have effectively demonstrated
this, thus refuting the thesis that agri¬
culture was introduced into America
from Asia.
The initial phases of an agricultural
economy are known to have occurred
in different parts of America, first with
seasonal sedentary settlements and
then year-round permanent agricultu¬
ral sites. Central America and the
Peruvian-Bolivian area are at least
two of the centres on the continent
which originated the cultivation of cer
tain species of plants. Graded terra¬
ces and Chinampas (incorrectly called
"floating gardens") are two typical
techniques used here in early inten¬
sive agriculture.
From this point we see the begin¬
ning of a new process of development,
the so-called "high cultures" based
on what Gordon Childe has termed
the "urban revolution", depending on
extensive cultivation of maize, yucca,
potato, beans and squash as well as
the manufacture of ceramics, the use
of polished stone implements and the
beginning of the textile industry, etc.
In Meso-America (Mexico, Guate¬
mala, parts of Honduras and El Salva¬
dor) the high cultures began around
1,500 B.C. in the highlands. This was
the case with the Toltec, the Aztec
and Zapotee civilizations which ended
with the arrival of the Spaniards in the
16th century. The Olmec, Maya and
Totonec civilizations emerged in the
lowlands a little later than 1,500 B.C.
In the Peru-Bolivia area, both along
the coast (Huaca Prieta, Cupisnique,
Paracas, Mochica, Nazoa, Pachaca-
mac, Chuncay and Inca civilizations)
and in the Andean uplands (Chavin,
Cajamarca, Huaylas, Huilca, Qalas-
saya, Tiahuanaco and Inca civilizations)
the high cultures began to develop
about 1,600 B.C. until their decline at
the end of the 15th century A.D.
Alongside these great civilizations
there also existed much less advanced
cultural groups, hampered no doubt by
the rigours of their surroundings and
habitat. Notable amongst these were
the populations living in the great river
valleys of the Amazon, Orinoco and
Parana as well as their many tributa¬
ries.
From the 16th century, with the
conquest, colonization and accultura¬
tion stemming from the arrival of Eu¬
ropean immigrants, the original Indian
population of America underwent the
following three major modifications:
1) The Indians have dwindled to the
point of extinction, as in Uruguay,
Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic and
Puerto Rico; or a reduced number are
confined to reservations, as in the Uni¬
ted States.
2) The Indian population still exists
but has little contact with the, rest of
the country, living within its own self-
sufficient economy, virtually untouched
by the process of acculturation. Such
populations are found in the Amazon
and Orinoco river basins, eastern
Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, etc.
3) Large-scale intermingling of races
has taken place to the extent that the
majority of the inhabitants are biologi¬
cally and culturally mixed, though
small pockets of Indian populations,
where less intermingling and accul¬
turation have taken place, continue to
exist, as in Mexico, Guatemala, the
Andean plateau regions of Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia. M

Early man
and the emergence
of races
by Vsevolod P. Yakimov
50
HE 3,500 million humans
on our planet comprise an astonishing
conglomeration of peoples. Amid this
vast variety, anthropologists distinguish
between groups of people having a
common origin, living, or having lived,
in certain defined regions, and poss¬
essing differing characteristic features
in their facial structure, skin colour
and colour and type of hair.
Scientists call these groups races,
but we should remember that there
are no strict lines of demarcation bet¬
ween races. All these groups blend
imperceptibly into one another with
intermediate types possessing various
combinations of physical charac¬
teristics.
It can readily be seen that distinc¬
tions between individual groups do
not affect the basic traits that all peo¬
ple have in common an upright pos¬
ture, well-developed hands and feet,
an intricately structured brain encased
in a big skull with a straight, high
forehead, absence of a bony eyebrow
ridge, the presence of a prominent
chin and a common structure of the
VSEVOLOD P. YAKIMOV, of the U.S.S.R.,
Is Internationally famous for his work on
prehistoric man. He has written over
100 studies on primates and the evolution of
man. He Is director of the Research Insti¬
tute for Anthropology and the D.N. Anuchin
Anthropological Museum of Moscow State
University, and is a member of the Executive
Committee of the International Union for
Anthropology and Ethnology.
speech organs. All humans have the
same number of chromosomes (46) in
the cell nucleus; primates have 48 and
the lower simians between 54 and 78.
Thus modern man is biologically uni¬
form in basic features and polymor¬
phous as regards many secondary
features, and scientists consider all
human beings as belonging to the
single species, Homo sapiens. The
variations found in groups living in
different geographical areas reflect
only a differentiation within the single
species due to a host of biological,
social and other factors.
The emergence of the earliest Homo
sapiens was preceded by the stage of
the "oldest" (palaeoanthropus) and
the "old" (late palaeoanthropus) peo¬
ple, though it Is important to note
that late palaeoanthropus co-existed
with early Homo sapiens in adjoining
territories.
The genetic relationship between
various groups of palaeoanthropus and
Homo sapiens is a matter of consid¬
erable controversy. The question on
which anthropologists are divided is
whether all groups of palaeoanthropes
can be considered as the ancestors of
modern man and whether modern man
developed in one or several regions.
In modern anthropology there are
two schools of thought on the origins
of man and the major races the poly-
centric and the monocentric schools.
The founder of the polycentric
theory, the American anthropologist
Franz Weidenreich, assumes that mod¬
ern man evolved in several regions,
relatively independent of one another,
and that people developed at different
rates. His theory claims that modern
man evolved from the "oldest" and
"old" people In each region and that
this gave rise to the formation of the
major races Europoid, Negroid, Aus-
traloid, Mongoloid, etc.
Anthropologists of this school, such
as G. Debetz and V. Alekseev of the
U.S.S.R. and Carleton Coon and
C. Loring Brace of the U.S.A., point
out that representatives of the modern
races still possess traits typical of the
fossil remains found in territories
where these races once lived.
N the other hand, mono-
centrists, Henri-Victor Vallios and
G. Olivier in France, Francis Howell
in the U.S.A., Kenneth Oakley in Bri¬
tain, Victor Bunak, M. Nesturkh, Y. Ro-
glnsky and myself In the U.S.S.R.,
among others, consider that modern
man evolved in a single region. Pro¬
fessor Roginsky believes that Homo
sapiens emerged in a relatively wide
area covering west Asia, parts of cen¬
tral and south Asia, and north-east
Africa. Here various groups of pa¬
laeoanthropes interbred, enriching the
genetic stock and triggering off the
development of modern man.
The ancient Homo sapiens who
evolved there did not possess clearly
distinguished traits of any of the
modern races. In a certain sense he
was "neutral" in racial aspects, and
characteristics of the modern races
were present in him in the most diverse
combinations.
It was only when human groups
spread geographically and settled In
definite territories that racial types
evolved. That is why the races of
modern mankind resemble one another
so closely. This resemblance is a
sign of their common origin, of their
emergence in a single region.
The monocentrists, who believe that
mankind passed in its evolution
through the palaeoanthropus stage,
do not, however, maintain that every

Two major schools exist today regarding the
origins of man and different races: the mono-
centric or unilinear school believes that all
races evolved from a single ancestral line
(diagram above); opposed to this, the poly-
centric school sees the modern races of
man descending from four ancestral lines
(diagram right) which evolved in several
regions of the earth.

local group of ancient people formed
part of the ancestry of modern man.
For historical and natural reasons some
groups did not participate in the for¬
mation of modern man, or participated
in that process through subsequent
blending with already existing Homo
sapiens.
Some researchers, including myself,
believe the late Neanderthals, the so-
called classic Neanderthals, who lived
in the Early Wurm glacial period some
50,000 to 35,000 years ago, to be one
of these groups. They differed
greatly from Homo sapiens in physical
respects; they were short (150 to
166 cm.), massive, with big heads
and big, coarse faces, and they also
differed In their brain and hand
structure.
The late Neanderthals of Europe,
however, did not go up an evolutionary
blind alley. They too made consid¬
erable progress in the development of
culture, society and speech. Yet
certain of their characteristics, their
inordinate physical strength and struc¬
tural ungainliness, hindered and com¬
plicated their transformation into
modern man.
This hypothesis is borne out by the
palaeoanthropus fossils of the more
progressive "sapient" type found in
central and west Asia in the Teshik-
Tash caves, in the U.S.S.R. and the
Skhul, Tabun and Çafzeh caves, in
Israel. It is highly significant that they
are older (about 60,000 B.C.) than the
"classic" Neanderthals.
Fossils of ancient representatives of
Homo sapiens displaying some palaeo-
anthropic traits have been found in
the Crimea and the Caucasus, in the
Mousterian culture sites generally
linked with Neanderthals. This can be
taken to indicate that the ancient
"sapiens" spread from the area of
their origin to the west, where "clas¬
sic" Neanderthals still existed at that
time.
Quite recently the Soviet scientists
A. Zubov and V. Alekseev expressed
the view that Homo sapiens emerged
in two centres north-east Africa and
south-west Asia. This is a variant of
the polycentrist viewpoint, based
mainly on the differences between the
specific dental structures of ancient
and modern man, and can in a sense
be regarded as a compromise between
extreme polycentric and monocentric
views. Moreover, both centres fall
territorially within the fairly extensive
area the monocentrists regard as the
cradle of Homo sapiens.
The most likely hypothesis, there-

THE EMERGENCE OF RACE (Continued)

fore, as to who modern man's ancestors
were and where and when they
emerged seems to be as follows.
Modern man's ancestors were the
palaeoanthropes who possessed a set
of "sapient" traits and inhabited west
and south Asia and north-east Africa.
From this one area groups of Homo
sapiens spread to neighbouring
territories. As these Homo sapiens
populations, morphologically "neutral"
in relation to modern races, were
migrating, settling and integrating, the
modern races formed. Homo sapiens
probably emerged in the ancient
"homeland" some 50,000 to 45,000
years before our time.
This view is confirmed in particular
by data furnished by the British anthro¬
pologist, Kenneth Oakley. He estab¬
lished that the skeletons from Jebel
Qafzeh were 70,000 years old. Mor¬
phologically "Qafzeh man" was a
transitional form from palaeoanthropus
of the "sapient" type to Homo sapiens.
Radioactive carbon datings fix the age
of Homo sapiens fossils In Europe at
35,000 to 38,000 B.C. The oldest fossil
of modern man, the skull found at
Niah, on Kalimantan Island (Indonesia),
displaying all the traits of fully formed
Homo sapiens, is about 39,000 years
old.
Many original theories have been
advanced concerning the factors res¬
ponsible for the development of Homo
sapiens. At the beginning of this
century the French archaeologists
Gabriel and Adrien de Mortillet
considered changes in climate (from
humid, sub-tropical to a dry climate)
and the change from an arboreal
existence (which they believed Nean¬
derthal man to have led) to life on the
ground to be the main reasons for his
transformation into modern man.
Later, H. Weinert (Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many) and V. Gromov (U.S.S.R.) and
some other scientists asserted that the
colder climate, caused by the advance
of the glaciers, had been the main
factor in the progressive evolution
of the ancestors of Homo sapiens.
"TILL other scientists be¬
lieve that the evolution of Neanderthal
man into Homo sapiens was due lar¬
gely to the change from in-breeding
within small scattered palaeoanthropic
groups to breeding between different
groups, which thus put an end to the
negative consequences of incestuous
breeding. Naturally, every one of
these factors was Important, but it is
doubtful whether they alone could
have transformed Neanderthal man
into Homo sapiens.
In 1949 I expressed the view (it was
also arrived at independently by Fran¬
cis Howell of the U.S.A. in 1951) that
selection in the severe conditions of
the pre-glacial period prevented rather
than promoted the evolution of the
classic Neanderthals towards Homo
sapiens. The colder climate did not
promote mankind's progressive dev¬
elopment and the severe living condi¬
tions made the Neanderthal's physique
even more rugged.
Refuting the above theory, the poly-
centrists point out that classic Nean¬
derthals have been found in areas
far from the glaciers, notably in Iraq
(The Shanidar cave) and in Israel (the
Wadi el-Amud site). But they ignore
the fact that these were not pure clas¬
sic Neanderthals since they possessed
some "sapient" traits in the structure
of the brain-case and the shape of the
cerebral hemispheres as shown by
moulds of the inner skull surface.
The formation of "sapient" features
proceeded more actively on territories
free of glaciers. When we discuss
"sapient" features, less importance
should be attached to morphological
traits than to those traits of Homo
sapiens which substantially distinguish
him from his direct predecessor,
palaeoanthropus.
Researchers have always been
struck by the relatively high develop¬
ment of the culture of Homo sapiens,
as compared with that of Neanderthal
man, by his ornaments and his flair,
which his ancestors did not possess,
for various forms of graphic art (sculp¬
ture, stone and bone carving, poly-
chromic mural painting, etc).
This testifies to a qualitative change
In man's thinking, to a growing com¬
plexity in the relations between peo¬
ple and hence to a progressive dev¬
elopment of social organization and
forms of communication the emer¬
gence of speech.
Comparative studies of moulds
made of the inner brain-case of palaeo¬
anthropus and Homo sapiens fossils
show that in the latter the areas of
the brain connected with purposeful
labour, that is physical activity, speech
and the regulation of the individual's
social behaviour, underwent consider¬
able changes. Hence we can assume
that emerging Homo sapiens acquired
qualities important to man as a social
being. Groups of ancient people who
attained such qualities more rapidly
found themselves better placed than
other socially less organized palaeo¬
anthropic groups.
Professor Roginsky of the U.S.S.R.
was one of the first to advance this
hypothesis. He drew attention also to
the relative stability of the features
displayed by man as a species from
the moment of his emergence down to
our own times, along with the astoun-
dingly rapid advance of techniques and
social development.
At the same time the replacement of
the Mousterian culture, associated with
Neanderthal Man, by the late palaeo¬
lithic culture, generally associated with
Homo sapiens, proceeded against the
background of great changes in man's
physical type, so important to environ¬
mental adaptation. During the transi¬
tion from palaeoanthropus to man with
his present bodily structure, an evolu¬
tion of the species took place a
transformation of one type of man into
another. It can be assumed that, in
primeval society, selection, which guid¬
ed the evolution of the ancients,
stimulated their development into
Homo sapiens.
'NCE Homo sapiens had
evolved, social tendencies neutralized
and weakened the action of the
species-forming selective mechanisms,
and thus assumed paramount import¬
ance. Modern men began to resolve
the problems facing them, not so
much by adapting themselves to new
environmental conditions which had
resulted in anatomical and physiolo¬
gical changes in their ancestors, but
by relying on and utilizing the fruits
of collective labour.
For this reason the physical type of
Homo sapiens underwent no major
changes during many millenia, whereas
the range and complexity of his activi¬
ties developed enormously. Although
the morphological changes that took
place in Homo sapiens during the for¬
mation of the major races were partly
adaptational, they did not change any
of man's traits as a species.
According to this viewpoint, Homo
sapiens is a supreme stage, in speci¬
fic qualitative terms, of man's evolu¬
tion, a stage characterized by a high
level of social organization. In this
development of man as a social being,
speech has played a major role by
passing on the experience and wis¬
dom accumulated by many generations
and making possible their integration,
along with new individual experience,
in a collective store of knowledge.
Academician N. Dubinin, the So¬
viet geneticist, has aptly pointed out
that Homo sapiens is unique, since,
with his advanced social awareness, he
has developed, In addition to the
hereditary programme possessed by
all organisms, a second, non-genetic,
non-hereditary programme "a pro¬
gramme of social heredity" as Dubinin
calls it, which makes for man's pro¬
gress in every new generation.

The
puzzle
of Peking
man
by Pierre Leroy
FATHER PIERRE LEROY, S.J.. of the French
National Centre for Scientific Research, In
Paris, was formerly director of the Museum
of Natural History, at Tientsin and of the
Institute of Geobiology, in Peking. He was
a friend and collaborator of Father Teilhard
de Chardin, and Is the author of 'Dans le
Sillage des Sinanthropes" ("In the Track of
Sinanthropus"), Fayard, Paris (1971), which
presents unpublished letter between Teilhard
de Chardin and J. Gunnar Andersson, who
first investigated the Choukoutien site In
China where the remains of Peking Man
were discovered.
I HE discovery near Peking,
in December 1928, of the very early
fossil remains of a man, Sinanthropus,
or Peking Man as he has been named,
was an event of primary importance in
the history of the origins of man.
As early as 1914, the Jesuit priest
and natural historian, Father Emile
Licent, had begun exploring the Basin
of the Yellow River in the north of
China. There he had come across
some important layers of mammal fos¬
sils "dragons' teeth" as the Chinese
called them. Himself no palaeontolo¬
gist, he sent sample fossils to Marcel-
lin Boule, Director of the Institute of
Human Palaeontology in Paris, who
entrusted the task of examining and
cataloguing them to one of his pupils,
Father Teilhard de Chardin. Finally,
in 1923, it was decided that Teilhard
should go to China to examine the
fossil layers on the spot.
A French palaeontologlcal expedi¬
tion was organized during which Li¬
cent and Teilhard explored an area on
the edge of the Ordos desert, to the
north of the Great Wall, where they
discovered important layers of mam¬
mal fossils and some chipped stones
which on examination proved to be
extremely ancient. They concluded
that prehistoric man had once inhab¬
ited these regions, but no human
remains were found which could help
to identify the craftsmen responsible
for fashioning these stone implements.
In 1918, the Swedish geologist
J. Gunnar Andersson, founder of the
Museum of Oriental Antiquities at
Stockholm, was Invited out to China
to explore certain regions in northern
China for mineral deposits.
Johann Gunnar Andersson had
studied at Uppsala University which, in
1710, had become the headquarters of

the Swedish Royal Academy of Scien¬
ces. Men such as Berzelins and
Linnaeus had made the Academy one
of the most renowned of Its kind in
Europe. Fresh from university, An¬
dersson had taken part in Otto Nor-
denskjold's dramatic expedition to the
South Pole in 1901. After their ship,
"The Antarctic", had been crushed by
the ice, the members of the expedition
were taken aboard the Argentine war¬
ship "Uruguay" and returned to
Sweden in 1903. Andersson became
a professor of Geology and, at the
age of 32, President of the Swedish
Geological Society.
Andersson began prospecting some
forty miles to the west of Peking. It
was a region of bare hills whose lime¬
stone bedrock had opened here and
there and accumulated pockets of sun¬
baked clay, the "red earth" of the
Chinese geologists. Here he discov¬
ered a vast deposit of mammal fos¬
sils in a perfect state of preservation.
So rich was the find that he decided
to postpone its exploration until later,
and in 1920 he returned to the site ac¬
companied by Dr. W.D. Matthew, a
palaeontologist from the New York Mu¬
seum of Natural History, and Dr. Otto
Zdansky, of the University of Uppsala.
In the course of the excavations,
Zdansky found, among the rubble of
bones, two teeth which he was unable
to identify; had they come from a mon¬
key or from a man? Four years were
to pass before this puzzle was re
solved. In October 1926, to the gen¬
eral surprise, Andersson took a definite
stand the teeth found by Zdansky, he
declared, were human, and a hominid
had probably lived at the site of the
find.
Then, two years later, Dr. Birger
Bohlin of Uppsala University, discov¬
ered a perfectly preserved lower
molar In the same quarry. There was
no room left for doubt, it was a human
tooth, and the quarry In which it was
found was to become world famous
the quarry of Choukoutien.
I|T was now certain that
prehistoric man had inhabited the vast
territory of Asia, from south of the
river Yenisei to Peking. But where
were other remains of these creatures
to be found?
The spot to be explored was selec¬
ted on the basis of Andersson's intui¬
tion and the discoveries of his collea¬
gues Zdansky and Bohlin. Since Li-
cent and Teilhard had found no traces
of human skeletons in the Ordos de¬
sert, the search was concentrated on
Choukoutien. With the backing of
the Rockefeller Institute at Peking and
the Geological Survey of China, a
team of Americans, Canadians, Chi¬
nese, Frenchmen and Swedes set to
work.
The enormous mass of earth of the
THE QUARRY
OF CHOUKOUTIEN
Choukoutien hill was systematically
divided up into sections of two metres
square. Each cubic metre of earth
dug up was carefully sieved so that
nothing would be missed.
Dr Pei Wen-chung, formerly a pupil
of the Abbé Breuil in Paris, was in
charge of the excavations. Father
Teilhard, of the Geological Survey of
China, was responsible for the strati-
graphic study of the terrain.
The internationally famous prehis-
torian, Abbé Breuil, was also to play
an important role. He had previously
studied specimens from the Ordos
desert and had found traces of ancient
palaeolithic workmanship quite distinct
from that known in Europe. He was,
therefore, conversant with Chinese
prehistoric tools and his opinions
would be of the greatest value if other
stone tools were found.
In December 1929, the dome of a
skull whether of a man or a monkey
was not known was found lying in
the sand under a limestone overhang.
It was connected, perhaps rather pre¬
maturely, with the human molar found
earlier by Bohlin. Were its discov¬
erers right to dub it Sinanthropus or
Peking Man, or were they led, by
their desire to produce a startling dis¬
covery, to take their dream for rea¬
lity? At all events, monkey or man,
the problem of Sinanthropus had now
been posed. How was it to be re¬
solved? At that time there was no

means of settling the question, the
skull was so primitive and incomplete
that there was no way of deciding its
real nature.
Two criteria, tools and fire, enable
anthropologists to decide whether
they are dealing with the remains of
animals or men. Tools alone are not
enough, nor is the ability to fashion
them absolute proof of human pre¬
sence. In fact, under certain cir¬
cumstances animals are capable of
making tools. However, they lack the
quality of foresight. Once a tool has
been used for its immediate purpose,
it is abandoned, rather in the way that
a young child may throw its spoon
away after eating its soup, not think
ing that it will be needed again in a
few hours time.
Man is not only a craftsman; his
intelligence enables him to make abs¬
tractions. He makes tools that will
last and this power of abstraction en¬
ables him, unlike the animals, to make
and keep fire. When, therefore, an
anthropologist finds durable tools and
traces of fire beside fossil remains
that could be either of monkeys or of
men, he knows without doubt that they
must be the remains of men.
One day, Easter Monday in 1931, I
had to go with Father Teilhard from
Tientsin to Peking. Teilhard had been
away from China for several months
and he wanted to have a look at the
material from Choukoutien that had
been brought to the Cenozoic Labora¬
tory. This was the laboratory in
which studies were made of the geo¬
logy and palaeontology of the period
from the Tertiary to the present day.
At the laboratory we met Pei Wen-
chung with whom we had a long dis¬
cussion. We were on the point of
leaving, when Teilhard asked him point-
blank, "Hasn't anything really new been
found at Choukoutien?" "No", re¬
plied Pei, "we are still turning up lots
of remains of stag, tiger, hyena and
all kinds of small mammals". Then,
as an afterthought he added, "Oh yes,
I found this." From the drawer of his
desk he took out a few fragments of

between Father Teilhard de Chardin and Abbé Breuil

quartz which he handed to Teilhard.
Teilhard did not hesitate for an instant.
At first glance he had seen that these
quartz fragments bore signs of delib¬
erate shaping. "This quartz has been
worked", he said. Pei's delight
knew no bounds. "So these stone
fragments found near skulls must
therefore be Sinanthropus' tools?"
"There Is no doubt about it", replied
Teilhard. "So Sinanthropus was a
man?" "That is my opinion", answer¬
ed Teilhard.
Teilhard was even more sure of his
appraisal since," during his trip to Paris
in the winter of 1930, he had visited
Abbé Breuil at thé Institute of Human
Palaeontology and had placed on his
desk a small stag's antler on which
there was a protuberance. "I shan't
tell you where it came from", he told
the Abbé, "but what do you make of
this object?"
"It was heated shortly after the ani¬
mal was killed", replied the Abbé,
"and it Is an implement fashioned by
man by hammering the remains of the
animal's forehead with a stone ; the
marks of the stone's impact can be
seen on the stem". "But it comes from
Choukoutien", replied Teilhard. "1
don't care where it came from", replied
Breuil, "my conclusion remains the
same".
The quartz fragments found by Pei
seemed, .therefore, to confirm , the
great prehistorian's opinion. It was
immediately decided to send some
quartz samples to Breuil in Paris so
that he could give his opinion on this
vitally important matter.
Without waiting for the Abbé's reply,
Teilhard left for Kalgan where he was
to rejoin the Citroen motorized scien¬
tific expedition which was about to set
out for central Asia.
Meanwhile, at the invitation of the
Rockefeller Foundation, Abbé Breuil
went to Peking, towards the end of
1931. He wanted to examine the Chou¬
koutien site for himself. He did not
support the view held by the anatomist,
Davidson Black, his former pupil Pei
Chen-wung, and his friend Teilhard,
and his preliminary assessment was
that Sinanthropus was not a man. He
thought that he was more likely to
be some kind of game on which early
man had fed, throwing his bones,
along with tools and implements made
from stags' antlers, into the Choukou¬
tien quarry. Examination of the
quartz fragments showed plainly that
they were deliberately fashioned,
clearly recognizable tools. Yet there
was nothing to support the conclusion
that they were the work of Sinanthro¬
pus.
This was how things stood when
Teilhard returned to Peking after a
long and wearisome journey across
Asia. He immediately took up his
work at the Cenozoic Laboratory. In¬
formed by friends of Breuil's doubts,
he re-examined all the samples brought
back from Choukoutien, comparing
them with the Sinanthropus remains
beside which traces of fire had now
been found in the form of a layer of
cinders twelve centimetres thick.
Why did Breuil have such strong
reserves, and how had he come to
think up the Improbable theory of the
hunter and his game? The reason was
that he could see no possible chrono¬
logical link between the remains of
Sinanthropus and the perfection of the
stone and bone tools he was sup¬
posed to have used.
Teilhard was not a man to allow
himself to be influenced only by
"points of view". He wanted to base
his judgement on concrete evidence,
and he communicated his own observ¬
ations to Breuil. After several letters
had been exchanged between the two
men, Teilhard was unable to convince
Breuil and Breuil failed to shake Teil-
hard's convictions.
'PEAKING about Teilhard,
Breuil wrote, "To my great regret he
continues to stick to his original stand¬
point. While Teilhard is a wonder¬
fully good observer of a geological
site and an excellent palaeontologist,
he was not trained in technical prehis¬
toric studies and the industrial aspects
are beyond him."
The point at issue between the two
men was that, for Teilhard, the quartz
tools found were the work of Sinan¬
thropus, while for Breuil, the fact that
tools made of bone were also found
made this hypothesis seem extremely
doubtful.
The more value Teilhard placed on
the stone industry as indicative of the
capabilities of Sinanthropus, the less
sure he was of the specific nature of
the bone industry. In a letter dated
June 17, 1932 to his friend George Bar¬
bour he wrote, "A study on the stone
Industry of Choukoutien will appear
in the next Bulletin (of the China Geo¬
logical Survey). It puts forward a
more cautious view than that of Breuil.
I don't believe that a systematic bone
industry existed at Choukoutien."
A few months earlier (March 20,
1932) he had expressed the same
opinion in a letter to J.G. Andersson:
Concerning Choukoutien, you have
received Pei's paper (and possibly
Breuil's too) on the newly discovered
industry. Since these two papers
were published we have collected or
uncrated a large number of new sam¬
ples including a large series of chipped
boulders. I am sorry not to be in
full accord with my dear friend Breuil.
My present feeling is as follows:
1) The stones are certainly artifacts.
2) But, even in the case of the finest
specimens in quartz-crystal, the indus¬
try looks very primitive. I have been
unable to recognize any true "pointe",
for instance, nothing anywhere near
comparable with the Mousterian points
in quartz-crystal found in France.
3) The bone and antler industry
seems to me to be more than ques¬
tionable. I think that Breuil has been
deceived by appearances which occur
in any bone deposit. Logically he is
led to recognize a similar industry in
the Nihowan Saumerian beds, a sup¬
position which, so far, cannot be ad¬
mitted.
I hate this disagreement with Breuil,
since I like him awfully and since I am
partly responsible for his coming to
Peking. But what can I do?
The most critical point is to prove
that, without any ' doubt, the tool-
maker was Sinanthropus himself. But
the fact that the jaws and a piece of
skull were found together with the
tools seems as convincing as possible.
I am preparing with Pei a new paper
on this question. What a pity you
cannot come here for at least a few
weeks. We need youl
Good luck in your work.
Teilhard de Chardin.
Teilhard and Davidson Black were
on their way back from the 1933 Inter¬
national Geological Congress of
Washington when a cable reached
them from Peking announcing a discov¬
ery which could either decisively clarify
or further complicate the situation at
Choukoutien.
At the very top of the hill of Chou¬
koutien, where the site had been
broken up by previous excavations, a
trench had been dug and a shaft sunk,
at Teilhard's request, to give sideways
access to the Sinanthropus layer at
the bottom left of the excavation ditch.

Man, the first
walkie-talkie
CIENTISTS have long
speculated about the origins of
speech, and a great many theories
have been advanced.
One of the earliest, already current
in Ancient Greece, held that the first
words were onomatopoeias imita¬
tions of the sounds prehistoric man
associated with his various activities.
Another maintained that words devel¬
oped from inarticulate cries of fear,
alarm, delight and so on. According
to a fairly recent theory, it was the
combination of gestures and vocal
noises used to indicate a particular
action that led to the emergence of
speech.
But none of these theories explains
VICTOR BUNAK, of the Institute for Ethno¬
graphy of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences,
is one of the world's leading authorities on
the early development of speech. He has
written many studies on race, genetics, the
theory of the genesis of speech, etc., which
have been widely published in the world
press. Dr. Bunak Is a member of the Inter¬
national Anthropological Association, the
International Society of the Biology of Man
and of many other anthropological societies.
how shouts or onomatopoeias could
turn into articulate syllables and
words, or what factors determined the
development of mental activity along
with the faculty of speech so closely
connected with it. For it is man's
ability to speak that above all dis¬
tinguishes him from the animal.
Modern science places the begin¬
ning of human evolution in the early
Quaternary period, some 1.8 million
years ago, when a branch of biped
primates appeared. These hominids,
man's earliest ancestors, lived in the
open plains. They were omnivorous,
eating fruit, green shoots, roots, birds'
eggs, grubs and so on.
Since they were ill-equipped by
nature for life in the open plains, they
learned to use objects as weapons to
defend themselves and as tools to
obtain food: rocks to fling at their
enemies or prey, bone fragments to
clean carcasses, sticks and shells to
dig up edible roots. These imple¬
ments became essential accessories
to daily life, multiplying the strength
of the hands, extending their reach
and replacing the long, sharp claws of
beasts.
Animal behaviour is guided by
instincts by a chain of automatically
connected actions that never varies.
Actions based on choice and the
experience of much trial and error are
extremely rare.
The chimpanzee, for instance, can
use a stick to reach a coveted bit of
food. If he Is given two short sticks,
he will usually amuse himself with
them rather than try to use them to
reach the food. If he does manage
to join them together to attain the
food, he will have had to make so
many exhausting attempts that the
result has no practical significance.
This is because the two percepts
"action with the stick" and "making
the stick longer" exist in his mind quite
Independently. It is difficult for him
to connect them or to substitute one
for the other.
The use of implements, not accident¬
ally as with animals, but systematically
as in the case of man, became

ORIGINS OF SPEECH (Continued)

successful only when the choice and
treatment of materials began to
correspond to a preconceived aim, in
other words, when an association was
established between a chain of
actions.
Man finally left the animal world
when he was at last able to reproduce
in his mind coherent images of differ¬
ent objects and actions, to distinguish
between them and to combine some
with others. This enabled man to
form percepts about the common
properties of classes of objects. The
mental ¡mages of these linked percepts
are what we call concepts, and the
capacity to form concepts was the
first main feature distinguishing Homo
sapiens from the earlier hominids.
The next stage in man's evolution
was the ability to combine and diver¬
sify these concepts, a process that
represents a considerable develop¬
ment of the intellectual faculty. Con¬
cepts form the bricks of man's mental
activity, and even the simplest among
them differ substantially from the
"concrete percepts" to which the
mental activity of animals is limited.
The combination of percepts in a
single mental operation or concept
becomes possible because of its
association with vocal stimulations.
The link-up between the various per¬
cepts takes place in areas of the
cerebral cortex that are stimulated by
impulses coming from the vocal organs
as well as those coming notably from
the auditory organs. The sound of
the voice and the corresponding
movements in the mouth and throat
become, as it were, symbols of
concepts, a different set of vocal
movements being associated with
each one.
The vocal organs can produce a
great many sounds, but In each lan¬
guage only some 30, known as
phonemes, are used (sounds with a
distinctive and differentiating function).
There are, however, hundreds of
phoneme-combinations or syllables,
and many thousands of syllable com¬
binations. Even so, the resulting
vocal sounds do not become elements
of speech until a specific semantic
content or meaning becomes attached
to them, just as new concepts are not
assimilated until they have been given
specific vocal expression.
In the early periods of human
evolution, before definite speech
systems or languages existed, con¬
cepts and words were formed simul¬
taneously. This is a dual process
which consists of combining mental
percepts and vocal movements. When
a man thinks, even if he does not
pronounce words aloud, his speech
organs make rudimentary movements,

For some 200 years many people accepted without question the idea that
the world was created in 4004 B.C., a date carefully worked out in the 17th cen¬
tury by James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, on the basis of the ages of
Adam and his descendants as recorded in the Old Testament. Although
Archbishop Ussher was a great scholar, an expert in Semitic languages and
the author of several important studies on ecclesiastical history, his name
is today chiefly remembered by many people for the precise date he unfor¬
tunately fixed for the Creation, before the birth of the science of palaeontology.

Old fossils and
antediluvian theories
by Louis S. B. Leakey
and Vanne Morris Goodall
Text © Copyright. Reproduction prohibited
REHISTORY is a compara¬
tively new branch of science but the
records of man's preoccupation with
the riddles of his origins go back to
the dawn of history. In his early
search for the truth man drew upon
the riches of his imagination, and
strange stories, which were Invented, to
explain the mystery of creation, can be
found in the myths and legends of
many peoples.
As the centuries passed, however,
man began to look for a rational expla¬
nation of the mystery of life through
the study of nature. This led ultima¬
tely, as we shall see, to a bitter con¬
flict between the Church and the pio¬
neers of the science of prehistory,
which began in the eighteenth century
and was brought to a climax in 1859
by the publication of Darwin's Origin
of Species.
The crude stone cutting tools which
were made by our very early ancestors
are now accepted as the clues from
which we learn about their cultural life.
For many thousands of years, however,
these Implements, fashioned from flint,
chert, obsidian or other types of stone,
lay scattered over the face of the earth
and were regarded as mere "curiosi¬
ties of nature". Some Greek philoso¬
phers believed that these had been
launched by Zeus and called them
"thunderbolts", and local superstition
in many countries invested them with
magical powers.
It was not until the latter part of the
sixteenth century that Michael Mer-
cati, physician to Pope Clement VIII,
realized the true significance of these
so-called "thunderbolts". "Most men",
he wrote, "believe that ceraunia (thun¬
derbolts) are produced by lightning.
Those who study history consider that
they have been broken off from very
hard flints by a violent blow in the
days before iron was employed for
the follies of war."
Towards the close of the seven¬
teenth century, a London apothecary,
John Conyers, who was described
by his friend John Bagford as a man
"who made it his chief business to
collect such Antiquities as were daily
found in and about London", dis¬
covered "the Body of an Elephant".
Not far away he came upon a pear-
shaped stone. The two friends must
have examined and discussed this
stone on many occasions.
In Bagford's opinion, which must
have been met with a good deal of
scepticism at the time, it represented
"a British weapon made of a Flint
Lance like unto the Head of a
Spear", which had been used in the
days before Britons knew the use of
brass or iron. Bagford suggested,
therefore, that the elephant was one
of the many which had been brought
to England during the Roman occu¬
pation of Great Britain, and had
possibly been slain with the stone
weapon discovered by his friend
Conyers.
It was nearly a century before
John Frere made the next correctly
interpreted discovery of man-made
"stone tools". These stones described
by Frere as "spear-heads", were
found in the brick-earths in an ancient
valley at Hoxne in Suffolk, associated
with the bones of extinct animals.
Laying aside the preconceived ideas
of his generation, Frere had the
courage to announce what he believed
to be the true significance of his
discovery. He not only .recognized
the human origin of the tools, but
suggested that they belonged to a
very remote geological period, an
idea which was incompatible with the
persistent and widespread belief in a
universal flood in Noah's time.
This brilliant interpretation, however,
was ignored by contemporary scientific
opinion. It was not until 1859, when
the brick-earths of Hoxne were re¬
visited, by the geologist Sir John
Evans and by Sir Joseph Prestwich,
that Frere's Interpretations were
verified and his place as one of the
pioneers of prehistory was established
for all time.
It was not long before another vitally
Important step was taken towards
the unveiling of man's origins, when
the true status of fossils (which had
puzzled generations * of men) was
finally established. Fossils are now
known to be the remains of plants,
shells and bones which have been
preserved by natural means in the

ANTEDILUVIAN THEORIES (Continued)

earth's crust, and altered In consti¬
tution according to the influences to
which they have been subjected.
They are of vital importance to the
prehistorian for they supply the clues
which he needs for the reconstruc¬
tion of the long procession of diverse
creatures which have lived on our
planet.
The advanced thinkers of the eight¬
eenth century came to believe that
fossils were of organic origin. The
next step towards a better under¬
standing of their true value was to
find out when the fossilized creatures
they represented had lived. It was
only natural, in an age which was
deeply influenced by religious doc¬
trines, that enlightenment should be
sought in the Old Testament account
of the creation.
An answer which was acceptable
to a very large number of scientists
was found in the story of "The Flood";
this suggested that all creatures,
except those saved by Noah at God's
command, had perished under the
waters of a "universal deluge".
Clearly, then, it seemed highly
reasonable to accept the idea that
fossils were the remains of those
creatures which had been drowned in
the Flood and buried under the debris
which covered the earth when the
waters went down. This became
known as the "Diluvial theory" and
was strongly supported by the Church.
But there were a great many free¬
thinkers who believed that this philo¬
sophy was contradicted by the
evidence of geology. Groups of fos¬
silized animals, each differing from
the others, had been observed in
successive geological strata, indic¬
ating clearly that they had lived at
different geological periods of time.
If this was so, then they could not
all have been drowned In one and
the same great flood.
In order to accommodate the new
data, the famous French palaeont¬
ologist Baron George Cuvier suggest¬
ed that there had been a succession
of catastrophes, each followed by an
era of calm during which the earth
had been restocked. He was careful,
however, to fit this new philosophy
into the accepted biblical chronology.
God's first creation, he suggested,
had consisted mainly of marine
creatures, his second of reptiles and
his third chiefly of mammals. These
were destroyed In turn and a fourth
creation, as described in the Old
Testament, was ultimately swept
away by "The Flood", with the
exception of the inmates of the ark.
Launched by a man of such reput¬
ation as Cuvier, the new "Catastrophic
theory" gained immediate support;
but a handful of advanced and
courageous thinkers began to suspect
that the duration of geological time
had been grossly under-estimated.
At this time the Church was still
blindly supporting the conclusion
proposed by Archbishop James Ussher
in 1654, that the world had been
created in 4004 B.C. He had arrived
at this estimate by computing first _
the ages of Adam and his descendants,'
as recorded in the Old Testament, and
then by adding a number of years
deduced from a study of Hebrew
history.
Dinosaur eggs and mammoth bone huts
For centuries before the notion of evolution became generally accepted,
men refused to believe In the existence of fossils dating back hundreds
of thousands, even millions of years, and. all kinds of theories were put
forward to explain the strange objects that were constantly being
disinterred. One popular theory was that they were the remains of
creatures that had perished in The Flood, and in 171.6 the Swiss doctor
Johann Scheuchzer, seen in engraving left with a collection of fossils,
even published a book entitled "Museum Diluvianum". Many years of
patient research were required before the idea was accepted that these
objects could be the fossilized remains of creatures such as the
carnivorous Gorgosaurus (top right) who inhabited the earth some
75 million years ago. The amazing Dinosaur egg, bottom right, was one
of a huge quantity of eggs found a few years ago on a tract of land
at Roques Hautes, in southern France, by the curator of the Museum of
Natural History of Aix-en-Provence. Below, a dwelling built In prehistoric
times entirely from Mammoth bones, discovered In 1966 at Miejiritch in
the Ukraine, U.S.S.R. The bones of 95 Mammoths were used In the
construction of this dwelling which covers an area of 23 square metres.

Cuvier could not possibly fit three
additional creations into this time scale.
He therefore adopted the proposals
of Comte Georges de Buffon, a great
French geologist, and pushed the
creation of the world back by 80,000
years.
The early part of the nineteenth
century was remarkable for the
intense interest which scientists in
Europe, England and America began
to take in cave exploration. Reports
circulating in 1822 claimed that the
caves in southern Germany had
yielded the remains of many extinct
forms of animals, including those of
elephant, rhinoceros, hyena and bear.
The news of these discoveries inspired
an English clergyman, Dean William
Buckland, at that time also Reader in
Geology In the University of Oxford,
to investigate the Paviland cave on
the Welsh coast. It was not long
before Buckland made one of the
notable discoveries of the century.
The Paviland cave is set In à
limestone cliff and soon yielded a
store of prehistoric treasures. Flint
implements, as well as ornaments and
tools of bone and Ivory, lay embedded
with the same species of extinct
animal which had been found in the
stratified caves of Germany. With
them Buckland discovered a human
skeleton, stained with red ochre.
This became popularly known as
"The Red Lady of Paviland", though
it was later found to be that of a young
man.
The problem of interpreting his
discovery placed Buckland in a difficult
position. As a geologist, he suspected
that he had found the remains of a
"pre-diluvial man". As a Christian
minister and a Diluvialist, the tenets
of his faith precluded him from ad¬
mitting it. In the end, he apparently
allowed his conscience to dictate his
pronouncement. He explained his
discovery by suggesting that although
the remains of the animals had
probably been swept Into the Paviland
cave by flood waters, the human body
must have been intrusively buried at
a much later date, when man had
settled, in England long after "The
Flood".
A few years later a Roman Catholic
priest, the' Reverend John MacEnery,
began to investigate the huge
rambling limestone cave on the Devon
coast of England known as Kent's
Cavern. He found man-made stone
tools in association with the same
species of extinct animals that Dean
Buckland had uncovered in the
Paviland cave; but unlike Buckland he
did not allow his scientific judgment
to be obscured by religious beliefs.
In spite of the severe criticisms to
which he was subjected by the
Church, and even by Buckland, Father
MacEnery remained convinced that he
had found sufficient evidence to
maintain that man had lived in England
long before the time of the "Biblical
Flood", as a contemporary of the

AN EARLY
'EVOLUTIONIST'
An early exponent of the doctrine of
evolution was the German zoologist Ernst
Haeckel (1843-1919). These drawings made
by Haeckel himself In 1866 some of many
he produced for books on' biology illustrate
one example of his theory of recapitulation,
i.e. if a land animal had ancestors which
lived In water and used gills, each embryo
of that animal continues to develop gills
even though they may be lost during later
embryonic development. They show (from
left to right) fish, salamander, tortoise, bird,
calf, pig, rabbit and human embryos. At
first stage (top row) all have gill-like organs
to the right of the eye. At second stage
(centre) limbs develop but "gills" are still
present At third stage (bottom) physical
differences are apparent and "gills" have
disappeared In non-aquatic creatures.
ANTEDILUVIAN THEORIES (Continued)
Drawing Ernst Haeckel
The earth begins to yield up its secrets
62
extinct animals whose remains he had
found. The notebooks in which he
recorded his discoveries and inter¬
pretations were found and published
many years after his death.
Meanwhile, the extensive limestone
caves near Liège, in Belgium, had
been attracting the attention of an
intrepid and dedicated palaeontologist.
In the course of his explorations,
Dr Schmerling of Belgium investigated
more than forty caves along the
banks of the River Meuse and col¬
lected quantities of fossilized animal
remains which were associated with
implements of stone and bone. Human
fossil remains were both fragmentary
and scarce, but since he found them
embedded In the same strata,
Schmerling maintained, in spite of
opposition, that all three groups were
contemporary.
In 1833 he made the discovery for
which he is famous. Day after day,
month after month, he had been
visiting a cave named Engis. His
reward came at last with the discovery
of an almost complete "primate" skull.
It was embedded five feet within the
breccia and surrounded by the remains
of extinct forms of elephant, bear,
tiger, hyena, rhinoceros, reindeer and
other animals which had disappeared
before the beginning of what was then
accepted as the time boundary of the
late Stone Age. In Schmerling's
opinion, this was conclusive proof that
man had been living in Europe "long
before the Deluge".
Another discovery that was totally
Ignored during this period was made
in 1848 in Gibraltar. This find, a
well-preserved skull, was eventually
brought to England in 1862, but it was
not until the beginning of the twentieth
century that its unique place ¡n the
history of human evolution was finally
established. It represented, as we
shall discover, the first recorded
remains of Neanderthal man, whose
history plays an important part in the
story of man's evolution.
It was largely due to the brilliant
and indefatigable work of a French¬
man, M. Boucher de Perthes, that the
balance of scientific thought was
finally tipped in favour of those who
believed in the existence of "ante¬
diluvian man"
Boucher de Perthes was a lover
of antiquities as well as a great
scholar. In 1825, when he was about
forty years old, he was appointed to
the post of customs officer at Abbe¬
ville on the river Somme. The gravel
beds in the valley of the Somme were
continually being exploited for com¬
mercial purposes and had already
been investigated and found to contain
the fossil remains of extinct animals.
These gravel beds naturally attract¬
ed the attention of Boucher de Perthes,
who soon began to notice that many
curiously shaped stones were dug
from the gravel by, the workmen. In
spite of the fact that the gravel beds
had been assigned to the so-called
prediluvial geological period, Boucher
de Perthes was convinced that the
stones, which he began to collect from
the workmen, were in fact "stone
tools" which had been made by man.
He was sure that he had found positive
proof of man's existence in Europe
before "The Flood".
He claimed that the soils outside
Abbeville contained stones worked by
"antediluvial man", in association with
the fossil remains of large animals
belonging to extinct species. Boucher
de Perthes began to be regarded by
scientists as a dreamer and a vision¬
ary. The Church dubbed him a heretic.
He does not appear to have had one
single supporter of any authority until
1854, when he was visited by a
Dr Rigollot, a physician from Amiens,
whose scepticism about the age and
authenticity of the "stone tools" from
Abbeville was well known.
Having examined the Abbeville
stone implements, Rigollot returned
to Amiens and discovered that there
were similar stones in comparable
strata at St-Acheul near Amiens.
Completely converted, Rigollot ranged
himself enthusiastically on the side
of the opponents of the diluvialist
theory, and it is fitting that the work
of these two pioneers of prehistory
should be associated with two early
cultures of the Stone Age known as
the Chellean (or Abbevillian as it is
now called), and the Acheulean.*

Charles Darwin (1809-
1882) Is shown at left one
year before his death.
When he returned from his
voyage in H.M.S. Beagle
at the age of 27, he
brought back with him
specimens of the 13 types
of finches (right) he found
In the Galapagos which
were to give him the clue
to the relationship between
variation and adaptation.
The traditional Idea of
creation maintained that
each of these 13 species
had been separately creat¬
ed and never varied.
Darwin assumed that since
these species were fund¬
amentally the same they
were descended from a
common ancestor and that
the variations were due to
adaptation to circumstan¬
ces. Darwin was violently
attacked from all sides
after the publication of
"On the Origin of Species".

Germany, carried the cap¬

tion with one of his
ancestors."

We have already seen how the
significance of a fossil human skull,
found in a quarry in Gibraltar in 1848,
went unrecognized. Nine years later,
some workmen quarrying the limestone
cliffs of a deep ravine near Düsseldorf
in Germany made a similar remarkable
discovery. The celebrated Nean¬
derthal cave (which has long since
been demolished), then opened half
way up the steep side of the cliff and,
in 1857, the remains of a strange
individual were found buried beneath
its floor.
By good fortune, a medical doctor,
who was interested in fossils, re¬
covered the remains of this skeleton
from the workmen and sent them to
an expert anatomist for examination.
The extraordinary character of the
skull presented many problems. These
were made the more difficult and
unhelpful because no other animal
remains and no artifacts were found
nearby. There was literally no asso¬
ciated clue to guide the scientists in
their estimation of the antiquity of
these human bones. The find aroused
intense interest in scientific circles.
It is to Professor William King of
Queen's College, Galway, in Ireland,
that honour is due for being the first
scientist to recognize that the skull
cap . from the Neanderthal cave
belonged to a representative of a
hitherto unrecognized type of mankind.
Although the vault of the skull was the
only well-preserved part of the fossil,
King created a new species for its
reception and named It Homo neander-
thalensis.
Scientists of the time were not then
ready to believe that the prehistoric
world might have been peopled by
different species of mankind. Many
of them therefore continued to regard
the Neanderthal skull as a pathological
specimen. More than half a century
was to elapse before King's opinion
was endorsed by science and the
famous skull from the Neanderthal
cave accepted as representing
a member of the species he had
named Homo neanderthalensis.
The first half of the century was
now almost over, and the stage was
set for one of the most dramatic
moments in the history of science.
Lyell and other geologists of the period
had pushed the story of our planet
back in time, presenting mankind
with a new and awe-inspiring concept
of a world which was old beyond
imagining.
Their research had revealed that
great areas of land, now submerged
by water, had once joined Asia to
America, Europe to Africa, and Great
Britain to the rest of Europe, so that
in prehistoric times both men and
animals could have wandered across
these land bridges from one con¬
tinent to another. Evidence had also
been discovered to show that large
parts of the world had once been
frozen in the grip of a great glacial
epoch.
In Switzerland, between two glacial
deposits, geologists had found a bed
of fossilized plants which could only
have flourished in a temperate climate.
This, together with an accumulation
of additional data, led them to believe
that there must have been both glacial
and ¡nterglacial stages within the
Great Ice Age.
From about 1850 on, the "Diluvial"
theory rapidly lost ground. Not only
was it untenable in the light of the
new geological data which were
coming to hand, but many scientists
were beginning to wonder whether the
Biblical "Flood" had, in fact, been a
"Universal Deluge", or merely a local
flood confined to the area in and
around the Euphrates Valley, where
Adam and all his descendants, In¬
cluding Noah, had reputedly lived.
Learned men throughout the ages
have speculated upon the number and
combination of species which Noah
must have packed into his Ark. In
the sixteenth century the famous
Elizabethan sailor and explorer, Sir
Walter Raleigh, calculated that there
must have been "eighty-nine distinct
species of beastes", but by the end
of the eighteenth century this figure
had been doubled, and the estimated
proportions of the Ark had grown
correspondingly formidable.
The problem was aggravated by
evidence which had now come from
such far-flung areas as Africa, Asia,
America and Europe, that each con-

PILTDOWN MAN
FOSSIL
FORGERY
In 1912, a British amateur geologist and
antiquarian, Charles Dawson, reported
the discovery first of parts of a skull
and later of a jaw in a gravel pit at
Piltdown in southern England, which
when reconstructed proved to be a
modern human cranium possessing an
ape-like lower jaw. "Piltdown man", as
the remains became known, which
looked like a new kind of "missing link"
between man and the apes, sparked off
one of the longest and most sensational
controversies in the study of prehistory.
~he remains were at first accepted as
genuine by a few authorities, but it
became increasingly difficult to recon¬
cile the Piltdown man with other finds.

such as Java man and the African pre-
men which had more ape-like skulls and
more man-like jaws. Finally, in 1953,
special studies and tests proved un¬
questionably that the Piltdown skull
fragments were a fraud that they
belonged to a modern man and the teeth
and jaw to a modern ape. The material
had been chemically treated and skil¬
fully tampered with to make it appear
ancient and authentic, and it had been
planted in the gravel pit by an uniden¬
tified hoaxer. One theory is that the
perpetrator aimed to embarrass the
prehistorians of his time and undermine
the entire idea of human evolution, still
strongly challenged in many quarters.
With modern scientific dating methods,
no "fossil" like the Piltdown man would
be likely to escape detection today.
Above, Charles Dawson (standing right)

Sir Arthur Keith measure the Piltdown
skull. The three skulls on left show,

tinent had its own particular fauna.
Forms ancestral to these animals had
been found In geological deposits
formed before the Biblical "Flood"
could have taken place. Only by
means of a miracle, therefore, could
Noah have collected individuals from
all the living species in the world
before the "Flood" and redistributed
them afterwards.
The controversy regarding the
existence of man in Europe before
the "Flood" now began to die away,
and scientists concerned themselves
with the chronology of glacial and
interglacial man and his cultural
remains. Now that the true signi¬
ficance of stone tools was appreciated,
a vast wealth of data was beginning
to accumulate about the social life
and Industries of our remote ancestors.
A succession of classified cultures
known as Stone Age, Bronze Age and
finally Iron Age had by now been estab¬
lished.
Theories and ideas, suppressed for
so long by religious prejudice, now
struggled into the light, and were
apparent in the new and rational
approach which was being adopted
in the search for man's origins. Many
of the old beliefs which had been
exaggerated by poetic fiction were
therefore swept away.
Wherever the curiosity of man led
him to investigate and chronicle the
marvels of the natural world, scientists
now found themselves in the posses¬
sion of a vast storehouse of know¬
ledge. It remained for someone to
postulate a theory which would account
for the diversity of life on earth
and the ultimate miracle of mankind.
The idea of evolving life, which was
so soon to capture the imagination of
man, was not a new one. Until now,
however, it had been stultified by the
bigoted acceptance of the doctrine of
special creation, which maintained that
all species remained exactly as they
were when first created. A handful
of advanced thinkers of the late
eighteenth century, such as Carl Lin¬
naeus, the famous Swedish naturalist,
Erasmus Darwin of England, and
Lamarck of France, had put forward
revolutionary ideas which were in
opposition to the theory of immuta¬
bility of species. It was, however,
Charles Robert Darwin who finally
gave the world a new concept of the
animal kingdom.
Today Darwin's concept of evolution
is so well known and so widely
accepted that It is difficult to imagine
the magnitude of the sensation it
caused when it was published in 1859.
The first edition of the book was sold
out very quickly and the reaction to
its doctrines was immediate.
The Church saw it as a threat to
the very foundations on which the
doctrine of special creation and the
literal belief in Biblical chronology had
been built. It therefore attacked
Darwin with an almost fanatical inten¬
sity. The idea that a wise and powerful
God had designed and created all
living things in a permanent immutable
form, was part of the Christian faith.
Many scientists, while recognizing the
genius of a theory which would with¬
stand the most acid tests of logic,
nevertheless turned from the idea of
the mutability of species on purely
religious grounds.
Darwin himself was emotionally
Involved in the conflict which his
theory of evolution had provoked, and
he always stressed that he had not
been motivated by any anti-theological
bias when he wrote the Origin of
Species. For those who came to
accept Darwin's theory, man began
to be regarded as the ultimate triumph
of a process of evolution which was
even more miraculous and awe-
inspiring than was the concept of a
special creation of each separate form
of life.

THE PUZZLE OF PEKING MAN (Continued from page 56)
In the course of this operation the
workmen discovered under the sedi¬
ment, at the top of the hill, a well pre¬
served cave, which became known as
the Upper Cave. It had been used as
a refuge by animals and by men.
Human remains, including three well-
preserved skulls of a much more
recent period than Sinanthropus, were
mixed with fossilized skeletons of hye¬
nas, bears, wild goats, tigers and
stags, and ostrich and civet bones.
Amid all this confusion lay evidence
of a quite different culture, fairly close
to the neolithic pierced teeth and
shells, more finely fashioned stone,
bone necklaces and polished stag
antlers.
One very important fact emerged.
A close study of this material and a
comparison of it with that found at
lower Choukoutien and the Ordos
desert revealed a number of affinities
and resemblances. Perhaps this was
due to the similar nature of the stone
raw material found on these sites:
quartz, hyaline, silicified limestone and
chalcedony, as well as pebbles used
for hammering.
Nevertheless, the man of the Upper
Cave, more advanced and a better
workman, had found a way of piercing
shells, teeth and even stones with
which to make necklaces, and the or¬
naments were always found in the
immediate vicinity of the skulls. The
industry of the Upper Cave belongs
to the close of the Palaeolithic era;
we are now at the beginnings of the
advanced era of shaped stone, the
Neolithic era.
Thus the discoveries made ¡n the
Ordos desert in 1923 took on new
meaning. The heterogeneous stone
industry uncovered by Licent and Teil¬
hard was probably the work of men
of differing races, brought to this
place by migratory waves. It has
links with Mousterian, Aurignac and
Magdalenian industry. The man or
men of Ordos fill an intermediary posi¬
tion between the two fossil forms
found near Peking.
Prehistoric men, one group as old
as Pithecanthropus, the other more
recent, Homo sapiens, inhabited the
Choukoutien site, using, at an inter¬
val of some tens of thousands of years,
the same raw materials for their indus¬
try a primitive industry of uneven yet
also inestimable value to the anthro¬
pologist, having specific, distinctive
characteristics readily detectable to
specialists.
As far as the bone industry of the
Sinanthropus period is concerned, al
though it was positively identified and
defended by Abbé Breuil, it remains a
subject of controversy to this day.
The friendly, scientific quarrel bet¬
ween Teilhard and Abbé Breuil was
never finally resolved, each of them
maintaining his own position. Was
this necessarily a bad thing? I do not
think so. It shows us how far a scru¬
pulous study of facts can leave men
of science divided when they are con¬
vinced that their reasoning is rigor¬
ously objective.
Although, as far as I know, Abbé
Breuil never went back on his opinion,
he nevertheless sided with the spe¬
cialists. Like them he saw in Sinanthro¬
pus a representative of a race of men
in the full sense of the word, that is to
say, capable of handling fire and
making use of quartz and pebbles in
a way essential for his survival. What
he did not accept was that all the stone
and bone tools found in the Choukou¬
tien layer were made by Sinanthro¬
pus.
Let us hope that today's Chinese
geologists and anthropologists will
reap as rich a harvest as their prede- nr
cessors.and that, one day, they will QQ
give us the long-awaited answer.

The name of Mikhail Gerasimov is now internationally famous for his
reconstructions of the faces of historic world personalities (here three stages
in reconstructing the face of the great 14th century conqueror, Tamerlane),
which led to his revolutionary work in the reconstruction of the features

THE FACE-MAKERS

^^URIOSITY about the past Is an enduring characteristic of
mankind, and Interest In our predecessors Is not limited to the
hard facts of what they achieved and how they lived; equally
intriguing is the question of what they looked like.
Improved scientific methods of creating anthropological por¬
traits from skulls, developed over the past few decades, have
enabled us to reconstruct the likenesses of such legendary figures
of the past as Ivan the Terrible and Tamerlane (see photos below).
These methods have also made it possible to authenticate disput¬
ed human remains, as, for example, in the case of the puzzle of
the two skulls of the German poet Friedrich Schiller (see photo
story page 68).
With historical figures such as these, records and descriptions
exist by means of which we can check the accuracy of our recon¬
structions, but the task is not so easy when we attempt to create
anthropological portraits of our prehistoric ancestors.
The first attempts to reproduce the outward appearance of early
man were made during the last decades of the 19th century.
Anatomists had established certain links between the shape of
the skull and the flesh and muscles of the face. Such men as
Professor Schaffhausen of Germany and Professor Kohlman of
Switzerland were pioneers In this field and during the first half
of this century several anatomists and anthropologists, sometimes
with the help of artists and sculptors, attempted to reproduce the
features of our early ancestors.
However, reconstructions made by different people of the same
Neanderthal skull from La Chapelle-aux-Saints, In France, were
so varied that it was clear that the methods used were inade¬
quate. A big step forward was made by the French anthropologist
by Mikhail Gerasimov
Marcellin Boule who reconstructed the basic muscles of the face,
neck and torso on the assembled Neanderthal skeleton from La
Chapelle, creating a figure with the characteristically stooped
spine, the short, forward-thrusting neck and protruding head.
I had been interested In this problem ever since I was a
schoolboy and realized that before creating a portrait of prehis¬
toric man we first had to learn how to reproduce the appearance
of contemporary man. For ten years I carried out research Into
the techniques for reproducing faces from skulls and, In 1937,
I was able to formulate a method which has proved itself over
more than thirty years and has even been used by criminologists
to identify unknown persons.
Historical problems too were resolved by these methods. Why,
for example, were Tamerlane and his son Shahruh of different
anthropological types? Tamerlane's skull Is Mongoloid, while
Shahruh's Is Europoid. Proof of the blood relationship between
Tamerlane and his descendants Shahruh, Mironshah, Ulug-Beg
and Mohammed-Sultan was provided by the morphology of their
skulls; they all possessed the same asymmetrical form which
could only be explained by heredity. Shahruh, however, inherited
his Europoid features from his Tadjik mother.
When the family sepulchre of Ivan the Terrible was opened In
1963 there was considerable doubt as to the authenticity of the
skeletons found. The reconstructions I made corresponded per¬
fectly with contemporary portraits of the Tsar (the right eye
smaller than the left, the heavy chin, the protruding lower lip,
which combined to give him his "terrible" appearance) and of his
son (an Insignificant, harmless bald-head).
I was also able to identify with certainty the skull of the 11th

MIKHAIL GERASIMOV Is shown at right working on the recon¬

Reconstruction at the Institute of Ethnography of the U.S.S.R. Aca¬

century poet Rudakl; the eye orbits of his skull showed signs
of atrophy resulting from the blindness with which he is known
to have been afflicted.
The comprehensive study of modern man by anatomical and
anthropological methods, by X-Rays and photographs of living
persons, provided a great deal of information about the complex
relationship between the structure of the muscles and soft Integ¬
ument of the head and face and the skull. In the case of pre¬
historic man the skull, of course, Is the only thing we have to go by.
The Individual features of man are determined by the propor¬
tion, size and shape of the skull, its asymmetry, the degree of
relief development, the structure of the surface, the vertical and
horizontal profiles, the structure of the nasal bones, size and
shape of the teeth, their bite, the size and shape of the eye
orbits. The thickness of the soft tissue depends upon the
degree of development of the relief of the skull. As a rule, very
ancient hominids possess fairly strong reliefs and this is taken
Into account in reconstructing their features, but the same methods
and techniques are employed in reproducing the likenesses of
both prehistoric and modern men.
I began working on a portrait of prehistoric man In 1937 and
we now have an entire gallery of portraits showing man's evo¬
lution from the Lower to the Upper Palaeolithic period.
Reconstructions made from the skulls, of ancient forms of men,
such as "Pithecanthropus" and "Sinanthropus", give clear
evidence of the wide range of morphological variations and the
complexity of human evolution. Study of early Neanderthalolds
and of classic Neanderthals, helps us to understand the mech¬
anisms which led to the beginnings and the development of
early "sapiens" forms.

THE TWO SKULLS
OF FRIEDRICH
SCHILLER
When the German poet Friedrich Schiller
died, In 1805, two deathmasks were made,
one In plaster and one in terra-cotta, and
a portrait drawn by Professor Jagelmann
(Photo No. 5). In 1826, a skull (Photo
No. 1) and skeleton were exhumed from
the communal grave in which Schiller had
been burled and identified by his children,
by Goethe and by Schwabe as Schiller's.
Later serious doubts were raised and It
was said that the skull was not Schiller's.
In 1911 an anatomist, Froriep, found ano¬
ther skull (Photo No. 3) in the same
common grave which he claimed was the
true Schiller skull. In 1961, the German
Academy of Sciences In Berlin asked
Professor Gerasimov to use his technique
of plastic reconstruction to determine
which of the two skulls was authentic.

MAN, THE FIRST WALKIE-TALKIE
Continued from page 58
giving the same record on an electro-
myograph (a recording of muscular
vibrations) as for spoken words. So
the communication of information and
the formation of concepts supplement
and control each other.
The combination - of percepts in
concepts and the expression of their
symbol, the word, has become a
function of the speech organs because
no other human organ can respond
with such versatility, accuracy and
speed to impulses from the cortex,
without an excessive expenditure of
energy and without interfering with
any other motor activities.
Modern man can pronounce hun¬
dreds of syllables a minute, each of
which requires a different use of the
vocal chords, a different direction of
air expelled from the lungs and a
different positioning of the tongue and
the mouth cavity. The whole system
of articulation can switch from one
position to the next in a fraction of a
second.
This mobility of the speech organs
and the extremely flexible link-up of
concepts are the result of a long
evolution. To trace the steps in this
evolution scientists have studied the
different stages of man's increasingly
complex mental activity, the structure
of jaws and other parts of skeletons
in fossilized apes and hominids, and
the stone tools of prehistoric men.
No fossil records have been discov¬
ered of the first hominids who
systematically used stones and sticks.
The cut stones of the Olduvai culture
(1.7 million years ago) show that to
give a stone a pointed tip, the crafts¬
men of that period chipped off several
irregularly-spaced pieces of different
sizes, which suggests that the Olduvai
hominids were at an intermediary
stage between concrete percepts and
concepts, or what are known as
"general percepts".
Their vocal activity probably also
belonged to an Intermediate stage.
They inherited from their animal
ancestors audible signals consisting
of single sounds, but instead of
reproducing these sounds automat¬
ically they were already able to select
them to a certain extent.
The earliest hominids had already
mastered the art of making articulated
sounds and combining them in differ¬
ent ways to form syllables, which
initially remained unchanged. This
early form of articulate speech Is
called the "lalia" stage (from the
Greek word meaning to chatter or
prattle).
Lalias were not used to exchange
ideas or converse, but to stimulate
actions or to signal some important
event in the life of the group. They
were monosyllables with many mean¬
ings and of course had no grammatical
structure. Yet they possessed all
the basic properties of this type of
speech: fixed enunciation of separate
sounds and their combination into
syllables. (The capacity to combine
syllables and words did not come
until much later.)
Substantial progress in the develop¬
ment of speech is Indicated by the
shaped stones of the Acheulean
culture, which emerged some 200,000
years ago. These were implements of
a definite form with regular facets cut
all over the surface. To make a
primitive chopper it had been enough
to remember a sequence of four or
five blows, but to shape the Acheulean
implements the craftsman had initially
to have a clear idea both of the desir¬
ed final shape and of the sequence
of blows and other actions needed to
produce it.
The Acheulean implements reveal a
varied and flexible combination of
percepts corresponding to the con¬
ceptual stage of mental activity, though
naturally in rudimentary form, without
any clear-cut distinctions between
individual percepts. True thought
becomes possible only when there Is
a free combination of at least two
independent elements: the percept of
the action and that of the object or
subject of the action; at the previous
stage both aspects are fused.
Along with the flexible combination
of separate percepts, the Acheulean
hominids mastered the free combin¬
ation of syllables, forming words.
Their fossilized remains show that
they possessed a larger brain than
the earlier forms, as well as a less
massive and shorter mandible. Be¬
cause of this shortening of the lower
jaw, the root of the tongue was lower
and the position of the larynx was
altered, which meant that the air
current was no longer directed straight
at the lips, but had now to overcome
various barriers, notably the tongue.
The first words, still few and mainly
monosyllabic, related to material
objects and basic facts in the lives
of primitive peoples, particularly their
food-gathering, and perhaps some
percepts with a magical meaning.
New words were formed by doubling CQ
or Inverting syllables or by changes Uw
in the pitch of some sounds. First
mastered by one or several members

ORIGINS OF SPEECH (Continued)
of a group, they were adopted by the
group as a whole if they supplied a
need, and then modified by practical
use.
During the later Stone Age, the
paleoanthropes or Neanderthal men
gradually enriched their vocabulary,
but their intellectual faculties and
speech seem to have remained on the
same level of isolated words. A
major change took place at the end
of the Stone Age, at the time of the
fourth and final glacial period, when
the direct ancestors of modern man,
(Homo sapiens), appeared, some
50,000 to 30,000 years ago.
The brains of these early men were
about the same size as those of their
predecessors, but their skull had a
higher vault and more rounded forms,
especially the forehead and the back
of the head. The lower jaw was
smaller, and the area of the muscle
attachment was also reduced, aiding
rapid articulation. The muscle attach¬
ments inside the lower jaw were
also similar to those of modern man,
while the bone on the outside had
grown forward to form a chin.
These Neolithic men had made
remarkable progress in stone-cutting
techniques. More elaborate imple¬
ments of many kinds were made,
including bone articles and even
needles. Ornamentation, sculpture,
drawing and painting were also widely
developed. The main occupation of
these men was, of course, hunting
wild animals.
So far as their technology, economy
and arts were concerned, these
people of the last glacial period in
Europe had a standard of living and
way of life that were by no means
inferior to those of certain hunting
and food-gathering tribes still existing
today. There is no doubt that they
were able to form paired combinations
of concepts and words (relating an
action to the object of the action).
In other words, they had fully master¬
ed articulate speech.
The emergence of Neolithic man
with his combination of separate
words with different meanings ends
the history of the origins of speech
as a general human trait. The periods
that followed saw the elaboration of
different speech systems or languages
with their own phonetic, lexical and
grammatical structures.
According to historical, archaeolo¬
gical and linguistic research, the great
basic language systems emerged in
the early Age of Metals some 6,000 to
9,000 years ago, while the formation
of many contemporary languages dates
from historical times.

10 MAJOR CONCLUSIONS
on the origin of Homo sapiens
1. Recent discoveries have upset the long-accepted time scale which
showed a modern type of man emerging at around 35,000 B.C.
These discoveries indicate the existence of men apparently of a
modern type, not Neanderthals, over 60,000 years ago. These men
existed in Europe as well as in Africa, the Middle East and perhaps
Asia.
2. The Mousterian culture, so called from artifacts found at Le
Moustier in south-west France and dated to between 90,000 and
35,000 years B.C., was formerly closely linked by anthropologists
to Neanderthal man. But Mousterian type artifacts have been found
at such places as Qafzeh, in Israel, and were not the work of Nean¬
derthals but of a modern type of man.
3. Prehistoric tools, etc., of a type considered to be Upper Palaeo¬
lithic, a period formerly dated from 35,000 B.C. to 9,000 B.C., have
been found in Cyrenaica and Poland and shown, by carbon 14 dating
methods, to date from 38,000 B.C., that is overlapping the period of
Neanderthal man.
4. It therefore seems certain that modern type men and Neander¬
thals coexisted for a number of years and that Upper Palaeolithic
and Mousterian cultures overlapped In time.
5. The transition from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic seems to have
occurred in a number of regions. Perhaps a proportion of the
Neanderthal population evolved to something nearer to modern man
and there may have been groups of modern type men in various
places whose stone industry,was Mousterian to start with and later
progressed to Upper Palaeolithic. This is called the "polycentric"
theory.
6. Anthropologists now seem to accept as definite that the classic
European Neanderthal man of the type found at La Chapelle-aux-
. Saints, in France, must be excluded from the direct ancestry of
modern man.
7. It also now seems to be accepted that certain characteristics of
"modern" man appeared separately or in various combinations at
widely different geographical points and at differing points on the
time scale. Fossil remains recently found at Orno, in Africa, for
example, support this view.
8. At the present stage of research a number of hypotheses about
the origins of modern man are possible.
According to conventional theory, "modern" man evolved in a
vast area comprising eastern Europe and western Asia from a non-
specialized form of Neanderthaloid man. This theory is known as
"diffuse monocentrism".
Dr. Leakey, however, suggests that a split occurred in the genus
"Homo" in the Lower Pleistocene period (some 2-3 million years ago)
with "Pithecanthropus" and Neanderthal man.
The majority of the anthropologists attending the Unesco Sympo¬
sium accept the view that polycentric evolution is the most likely
explanation for the occurrence of fossil human populations at
different times and places. It is not, however, maintained that all
lines of descent contributed directly to the evolution of present
forms of man.
9. Proof that the early types of "modern" man and Neanderthaloid
types are not different species may perhaps be found in the disco¬
very in the Middle East of intermediary types, perhaps resulting from
cross-breeding. (Thoma's theory).
10. Some anthropologists accept the Idea that variations in environ¬
ment and climate played an important part in the physical and
cultural evolution of man In regions of extreme climate. Others
maintain that physical evolution was determined by culture rather
than by environment.

The hunter and bison of Lascaux
With its walls and ceilings covered by a vast panorama of
coloured paintings, the Lascaux cave in south-west France,
discovered in 1940, is a veritable "cathedral" of prehistoric
art. Air exhaled by thousands of visitors speeded up erosion
of the limestone walls, and the caves, closed to the public
in 1963, are unlikely to be reopened in the foreseeable future.
In this remarkable hunting scene, a wounded bison with a

spear through its body (not shown here) rushes furiously
towards a stick-figure man lying on the ground. Below the
man is a mysterious bird-headed stick. Authorities are not
always agreed on the symbolic meaning of such Palaeolithic
cave art, but its richness and variety help to convey some¬
thing of the culture, thoughts and beliefs of men who lived
some 15 000 years ago.
