"that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could secure

INTERVIEW
WILLIAM STYRON
talks to Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat
The Pulitzer Prize-winning American writer
William Styron is the author of a strikingly original body of fiction,
almost baroque in style, in which the South where he was born
and grew up is the setting for violent and tragic events. In this interview
he talks about his life and experience as a writer and makes some
trenchant comments on current world developments.
M Everybody knows of William Styron,
author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The
Confessions of Nat Turner and of Sophie's
Choice, but few people know much about
your pastfor example, that you served in
World War II as an officer in the US
Marines, or how you came be one of Amer¬
ica's most important andpopular novelists.
- Well, it is not all that exciting. I was born
in Newport News, Virginia, in June 1925,
and I did get in at the end of World War II. I
was seventeen when I joined the Marines
and at that time they had a programme, if
you were very young, to give you some edu¬
cation before they sent you out to the Pacific
to get killed. I was aiming to become a
second lieutenant in the Marine Corps and
second lieutenants in the Marines had a
higher mortality rate than any other grade in
the services, but that was all part of being
young and "macho".
So I went to Duke University, in North
Carolina, for a time, and in 1944 I was trans¬
ferred to the Marine training camp in South
Carolina and then went on to the officers
training centre, in Virginia. I was on my way
to join the Second Marine Division when the
war ended with the dropping of the atomic
bomb. My feelings about the atomic bomb
are ambivalent because, despite the tragedy
of Hiroshima, I think that it saved not only
my life but the lives of hundreds of thou¬
sands of young men, both American and
Japanese.
I came back, returned to Duke Univer¬
sity and continued my education. When I
went back I had an extraordinarily gifted
professor, William Blackburn, who became
my mentor and who gave me guidance and
encouraged me to become a writer. So when
I graduated I went to New York and worked
briefly for the McGraw Hill Publishing
Company as an editor and manuscript
reader. I was unhappy and frustrated in the
job. I really wanted to be a writer, so I was
8

not very successful as an editor and was soon
relieved of my duties, which was a relief.
So I just began to write. I then met another
remarkable man, Hiram Haydn, who was
teaching at the New School of Social Research
in New York, and he encouraged me, saying,
"I think you should write a novel". So I sat
down and wrote a novel. It took me several
years, because I wanted to write a full-fledged
novel, not a typical young man's novel full of
sorrow and sentiment.
The book was published in 1951 under
the title Lie Down in Darkness. Amazingly it
was a best-seller. I don't mean that it was a
"blockbuster", but it sold 35,000 copies,
which in those days, and even now, was a
good sale for a first novel.
It is said ofDostoievsky that when he was
writing his novels he used to become very,
very overwrought even a little mad. How
are you affected when you are writing, espe¬
cially a novelas long as Sophie's Choice?
- Well, I think I have avoided madness, but
every work that I finish leaves me in a state
of depression and extreme anxiety about
what I have done. It is analogous to the post¬
partum depression women experience after
giving birth. I think there is a very distinct
connection. Anything of any great length I
have attempted and finished has certainly
been succeeded by a mood of severe anxiety,
a general sense of let-down euphoria at
first, extreme euphoria, but euphoria fol¬
lowed by a descent into a very deep depres¬
sive mood.
How do you live through these creative
years f How do you relate to other people
during theseperiods?
- It is hard to describe how I live when I am
involved in a long continual work, during
the days when I am creating in a continuous
way. My working periods are very intense
and then, when I withdraw from work and
live normally through the rest of the day, it is
as if the work itself is germinating constantly
in my head. I mean, I live a perfectly normal
life, visiting friends, driving to New York
and so on. But it is as though the work is
never too far away from my conscience. I am
always thinking about what is to come.
Likepregnancy?
- That's right. In a sense it is being conscious
of being pregnant, of having it in oneself not
yet delivered or not yet about to be delivered
but waiting for the day when it will be. I
remember when I was finishing Sophie's
Choice. I live in two places. I live in Connec¬
ticut in winter, early spring and late fall and I
live in Martha's Vineyard in late spring,
summer and early fall. Just before leaving
Martha's Vineyard the year I was to finish
Sophie's Choice, I remember standing on the
sidewalk and realizing in a flash that I had
only two more months to go and it would be
done. The sense of deliverance is a very
important factor. I remember saying to
myself "I am almost done'Vlt must be like a
woman saying, "In another month I am
going to be delivered".
Could you tell us something about how
you came to write The Confessions of Nat
Turner? Apart from its importance as a
novel, it seems to contain clues about Amer¬
ican society and about what slavery did not
only to blacks but to whites as well.
- 1 should start by saying that I was brought
up in the South, during the 1930s, in the
days of segregation. Virginia, like every
other ex-Confederate State, had legal sanc¬
tions against blacks. It was literally against
the law to mingle. When you got on a bus,
and if you were white, you sat up front,
black people sat at the back. In small towns,
if you went into a movie theatre black
people were always in the balcony and white
people below. In larger cities, like Newport
News where I lived, black people had their
own theatres, and most public facilities, from
restaurants to drinking fountains, were
labelled "coloured" or "white". It never
crossed your mind to go to school with a
black child.
I was brought up in this environment in
a family that was pretty liberal by those
standards. Yet we all obeyed the segregation
laws. But I was a young kid and I remember
being almost romantically drawn to the tra¬
gedy of black people. Somehow I had heard
about the Nat Turner revolt, which occurred
historically some forty or fifty miles away in
an area called Southampton County. A sign
had been erected there stating that in 1831 a
slave revolt had occurred led by a fanatical
slave named Nat Turner, who massacred
sixty white people and that he had been
hanged nearby on a tree.
As a youngster I was pretty rebellious
myself and as I grew older I became fasci¬
nated by this tale as an historical event and
wanted to write a fictional account of it. I
wanted this to be my first novel, but I soon
realized that I was not then ready to tackle
it. It was not until the early 1960s, when I
was in my late thirties, that I decided that it
was time to write this book. But it required
research. I realized that I did not know what
slavery was really about. So, although I did
not become a scholar in slavery, I read a lot
in the field and it was a revelation to me.
Early scholarship, which began in the
1920s, led by a historian called Ulrich B.
Phillips, presented slavery as a benign and
happy institution providing a satisfactory
solution to labour problems. Then, in the
1950s, a scholar named Kenneth Stampp
wrote a book which violently confuted the
Phillips view of the contented slave. Being
revisionist, this version went overboard in
the opposite direction and tended to present
slavery as a state of horrible depravity, com¬
plete oppression and brutality.

When I began to write about it, in the
early 1960s, it had begun to become clear
that the truth lay somewhere between these
two extremes. Without being doctrinaire or
following any rigorous dogma, I just said "I
am going to use my intuition, knowing every¬
thing I know about Nat Turner, and try and
write a book which will be my vision of
slavery". Whether rightly or wrongly, it
would at least be my vision and could be dis¬
puted. Nonetheless, it would be what I saw
the truth of slavery to be. It sprang from a
tremendous feeling on my part that W.E.B.
Dubois was right when he said, in 1900, that
the problem of the twentieth century would
be that of race. I believed it when I wrote Nat
Turner and I still believe it. I believe that the
central anguish of American life resides in
race. It informs virtually everything we do.
Of course, the Nat Turner book received
an extremely hostile reaction from black
intellectuals and it has only recently emerged
from the opprobrium heaped upon it. To
some degree this was to be expected, since I
wrote it in the first person. That was one of
the things that the black people were very
upset over that I as a white person had
tried to enter the skin of a black man, and that
was resented very much. I think, however,
that if the book has a kind of reality and vita¬
lity it has to do with the fact that I certainly
was trying to humanize an abstract figure in
history. Almost nothing was known about
Nat Turner because the records of the time
were very crude and primitive.
So would it be true to say that you see cur¬
rent American issues as being a continuation
of the historical racial issue?
- Yes, up to a point. There are, however, so
many contradictions that I don't like to state
anything categorically. Black people in the
United States have achieved enormous gains.
If you had told me when I was a kid that the
Governor of Virginia would be black, I
would have said "You're crazy". It would
have seemed totally impossible. So would
the idea that the Mayor of New York would
be black, or that we would have not one but
two blacks in succession as Supreme Court
Justices.
Nevertheless, blacks are still basically
disadvantaged en masse. For whatever rea¬
sons, they do not achieve the same success as
whites in the lower forms of education. Not
that the whites go to particularly good
schools either, but at least they are going to
schools in which the sense of chaos and
crime does not exist with the same intensity
as in the big cities like Detroit, Los Angeles,
New York and so on. This, to my mind, is
still the legacy of slavery. Moreover, the
family life of most blacks, not all, but cer¬
tainly, I would suspect, of the majority, is, by
white standards, deficient in all of the ameni¬
ties that white people hold out as ideal. And
this exacerbates the sense that they have not
much future. In this way the futurelessness
of slavery has been carried over to a large
degree into this century, with the exception
that the legal avenues are open and that, at
certain levels, blacks are able to achieve very
high goals. But they are exceptions.
Part of me says that we had this tragic
historical development slavery. But the
other part of me says that, with all the horror
and degradation that black people have suf¬
fered in America, with all the negative aspects
of black life, black people have produced
some extraordinarily energetic, marvellous
things, such as jazz music. Jazz has had a ter¬
rific effect on our culture, and that is just one
thing. There is something wonderfully eccen¬
tric about the way the black way of life has
sort of rubbed off and helped white people to
be less rigorous and puritanical. It has
become inherent in the national spirit. Just
the black way of saying things, the black
spirit, has added a whole lot to our culture.
And world music and dance today are
black in essence, in their origins.
- Yes. An interesting example of the black
transfusion is rock music. From the begin
ning there was the transfusion of black
rhythm, which gave rise to jazz, which then
developed into rock, which went to England
to be further developed by the Beatles and
other great rock performers. An enormous
amount of rock is derived from England.
But it would not have been derived from
anything had it not been for the black origin.
It was attacked very strongly at first
because it introduced an element of black
sexuality.
- That's right. Elvis Presley, who was from
Mississippi, was a white man performing in
the black mode, and the shock of it earned
him his nickname Elvis the Pelvis.
Let us come back to literature today. For a
long time American writers have been accu¬
sing the Soviet system of not giving writers
enough liberty to fulfil themselves. Yet in
America, England and France writers have
]]>

all the liberties, but there is a feeling that
they are not producing what they couldpro¬
duce.
Maybe. I don't know. Periods come and
periods go. Maybe it is hard to say at this
moment. Maybe at the time you cannot tell
until the period is over. But I know what
you mean. I don't think England has pro¬
duced a really exciting writer since Evelyn
Waugh and Orwell. I really think the writing
in England has been incredibly frivolous. I
am exaggerating; there have been some very
good writers in England since World War II,
but I always like to think of Evelyn Waugh
as the last one who really made an impact.
You think of the nineteenth century in
England. You think of Dickens, and D.H.
Lawrence later, you think of Thomas Hardy
even, who may not be read much any longer
but still is a tremendous writer. Despite my
own self-interest, I think that the United
States has been a more exciting nation of
writers since World War II than England, or
France for that matter. With France I think it
ended with Albert Camus. They have had
some excellent writers in France, but not
with that great excitement. I mean Margue¬
rite Duras, Nathalie Sarraute, I mean good
writers but nothing on that large exciting
level. Marguerite Yourcenar is a very good
writer. I don't know what causes literature to
become what it is.
So freedom alone is not enough?
- Philip Roth, whom I know quite well, went
to Czechoslovakia he got very interested
in Czechoslovakia during the time of its
occupation and he made a very interesting
statement comparing the totalitarian system
and the American system. He said that over
there everything matters and nothing goes; in
the United States nothing matters and every¬
thing goes. This is an indication of a very
large gulf between consciousnesses. I
remember going to Prague in 1985 and just
by sheer coincidence one of my books was
being published while I was there. I was vis¬
iting a friend who was the American Ambas¬
sador there and he took me to a bookstore
the next day and I learned there had been an
edition of 45,000 copies (I think of The
Confessions of Nat Turner) and the line of
people waiting to get that book stretched out
five blocks.
Were you there signing the books?
- 1 signed some later, but before that they
were just buying copies. It was very touch¬
ing to see that kind of interest. In the United
States, however, even though a writer like
myself has some reputation, no one would
line up to buy a book. There is a difference,
because in Czechoslovakia they only had
these 45,000 copies to sell. But it shows you
that in Czechoslovakia they care. They don't
care in America. There you have this abso¬
lute freedom, meaning that everything goes
but nothing matters. It is a big difference, a
big distinction. In the West, especially in the
United States, there is such a glut of every¬
thing. We are so overwhelmed by goods, by
objects, by sensations, by showbiz, that
these other things tend to be drowned out.
The novel is being written in the United
States like never before. First novels are
being published and yet nothing happens to
them. They sink. Someone writes a first
novel in the United States, but, unless it has
ballyhoo, showbiz, it is lost. The publisher
doesn't care about it, the public doesn't care
about it and the writer is left in the lurch.
You can, of course, with luck achieve a repu¬
tation as a writer, but, generally speaking,
any sense of a serious commitment to litera¬
ture just does not exist. It's too bad. D

The cire
by Alice van Buren
IN an industrial section of Paris, a big
brown tent straddles a two-lane strip of
cement. Beat-up cars, street bikes and
skateboards whip back and forth on the
tarmac. Flatbed trucks loaded with motor¬
cycles roar past the stands. Vacuum pumps
spew rivers of dust into the tent, while a
heavy metal band rides in on the top of a
moving van. Belching carbon monoxide and
fire, the parade unfolds like a punk comic
strip, unleashing jugglers, trapezists and
clowns, a squadron of human cockroaches
and a bare-breasted dominatrix on stilts.
Miming gang fights and urban crime,
Archaos, as this burlesque is called, is a slap
in the face of classic circus tradition. It is also
a bald and uncensored attempt to put the
street back into an art form that quit the
streets a long time ago.
Like it or not, Archaos is in the front line
of a movement to turn the conventional
circus upside down. It is one of nearly forty
experimental circuses that have sprouted out
of French soil in the last twenty years. A
rebel seed of the 1960s, a throwback to the
Dadaist years, the movement has tendrils in
Italy, Spain, Britain and Canada. Some of
these troupes are as refined as spun sugar: for
instance, the travelling Cirque Invisible, a
two-man confection mounted in 1971 by
Victoria Chaplin and Jean-Baptiste Thierée.
Some are frankly plebeian, like the Bread and
Puppet Theatre that was born in the anti-war
street scene of the 1960s in the United States.

crowds of volunteers, Bread and Puppet still
performs for free in public parks and mounts
a mock circus each summer in a stubbly field
in Vermont.
The circus of protest, of satire, of silence
it takes many forms is in a strange way more
true to the populist roots of the circus than the
grand spectacle under the Big Top with the
opera-priced seats. It is, at least in spirit, more
democratic. The circus, we're meant to
believe, can happen at any time, in any place: a
spontaneous explosion of mischief, as
occurred in West Africa when the British
troupe Ra Ra Zoo balanced tea cups on their
skulls for a street full of porters carrying bas¬
kets of fruit and grain on their heads.
Popular, vulgar, on the outskirts of town,
the circus has always had one foot in the
gutter. Formal circus artists, for the most

part, detest this. The circus, they say, has
nothing to do with the street. They insist on
their dynasties, their coteries and traditions,
and take a dim view of the new anti-circus
where, so they say, anything goes. In the last
200 years, the European circus has lifted
itself up from the muddy camp grounds and
squalid country fairs and produced an art
form as jealously defended as the ballet.
Devils
on horseback
The circus arts were born in obscurity in
the market place or the temple, nobody
knows exactly where. By the time they
appear in the record, they must have been
familiar sights on the streets. Acrobats dance
in the friezes of Egyptian tombs. Juggling
and tight-rope walking were ancient arts in
the Far East, long before Marco Polo docu¬
mented such acts at the court of Kublai
Khan. Bull dancers adorn the palace walls at
Knossos in Crete, and every cavalry known
to man Greek, Roman or Mongol
boasted some kind of daredevilry on. the
back of a horse. As for lions, tigers and bears,
animal acts can be traced to the menageries of
Babylon, the Pharaohs' pet cheetahs or the
trained crocodiles kept by their priests.
Bull-dancing (and its Spanish heir, the
bullfight) had cultic beginnings, as did Greek
drama. In Dorian Hellas, acrobats and mimes
clowned on the stage at festivals, arid at large
in the streets. The phallus was the centrepiece
of the costume. Holy or not, the antics
around it were far from polite.

A few centuries later across the Adriatic,
the fun took a turn well past the ribald, when
the politicians of Rome organized the first
full-fledged circus.
Panem et circenses, loosely translated as
bread and circuses, was the formula for paci¬
fying the Roman public. What it came to
mean was a bloodbath in a ring. To wit: the
Circus Maximus of Rome, a roofless, oval
hippodrome, where 150,000 bloodthirsty
Romans cheered on the slaughter between
chariot races. Elephants, bears, and jungle
cats were put to the knife by the dozens
sometimes the hundreds in a day. Later,
in the Coliseum, convicts and Christians
went the same way. As the Roman legions
marched north, the circus of violence spread
over Europe. Amphitheatres went up at
Verona, Capua and Pompeii, in Sicily and
Spain, at Aries, Nîmes, Bordeaux and in
Britain to be turned into quarries once the
empire collapsed.
Mountebanks
and mummers
The word "circus" was lost from common lan¬
guage. Mass entertainments would not recur
on such a scale until the twentieth century.
The Roman circus was dead, but its less orga¬
nized elements took to the roads. Through the
Dark Ages, animal trainers and acrobats wan¬
dered across Europe, Asia and Africa, sleep¬
ing in wagons or under hedges, entertaining
at rural markets or before royalty on com¬
mand. King Alfred was treated to a "Wilde
Beaste Showe" with mountebanks and mum¬
mers. William the Conqueror imported a
troupe of performers from France. Hannibal's
thirty-seventh elephant, the sole survivor of
the giant trek from Carthage, was said to have
founded a herd of performing pachyderms in
Europe remarkable if true, since elephants as
a rule don't breed in captivity.
Jean Villiers, an archivist with France's
Centre National des Arts du Cirque, finds
traces of the circus in medieval church car¬
vings. When 13,000 men were brought in to
build a cathedral, he says, the entertainment
soon followed in the form of mountebanks
and their troupes. Pickpockets plied their
trade, while the mountebank climbed onto
his stage and distracted the crowd (the name
derives from the Italian for "hop onto a
bench"). A vantage point for spying out
trouble, the bench also served as a spring¬
board for acrobats. Funambulists hooked up
their ropes to cathedral spires, and illusionists
turned the trapdoors and machinery of the
Church's mystery plays into trade secrets.
Some of these tricksters were charged with
sorcery and burned at the stake, but some
were far too clever like the wit who taught
his trick horse to bow in front of a cross.
The medieval laity adored these spec¬
tacles. The church was less enthusiastic but
condoned them at fairs, when pilgrims
gathered from all over the countryside on the
feast days of saints. Held in abbeys and
cathedrals, the fairs overflowed into neigh¬
bouring fields where merchants and entertai¬
ners set up their stalls. Once a year, a Chris¬
tian could tend to his soul, his business
affairs and his pleasure at once.
The most famous of these fairs was St.
Bartholomew's, at a priory outside London.

St. Bartholomew's Fair in
London is depicted in this
engraving made in 1809 by
the English caricaturist
Thomas Rowlandson, and
A.C. Pugin.
16
In 1133, a prior named Rayer, who had once
been a jester to Henry I, talked the king into
a charter for a three-day fair. Bartholomew's
Fair lasted 700 years, becoming something
like an annual circus convention.
Rayer had a reputation for working mira¬
culous cures. A hundred years later, other
kinds of miracles were being admired: a
woman doing headstands on the points of
two swords, another on stilts with a water
jug on her head and a baby in her arms.
Bartholomew's Fair stretched to a fort¬
night and then to six weeks. Under Henry
VIII, the religious dimension vanished. The
lines of booths became streets, which were
paved and eventually railed. In 1614, the
playwright Ben Jonson described a riot of
stalls with rattles, drums, halberds, pipes,
puppet shows, mouse traps, hobby horses,
dogs that danced the Morris, an eagle, black
wolves, a bull with five legs and a hare that
played the tambourine.
Fifty years later, "dancing on the ropes"
was the leading attraction. The tightrope acts
of today are mild compared to those of the
seventeenth century: horses and elephants
walked the ropes, as did one Italian who
danced on a rope with a duck on his head,
pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with two
children and a dog, singing a song as he went.
Each fair developed its strength: some
specialized in freaks, others in puppets. Bar¬
tholomew's Fair became headquarters for
impresarios who toured the rest of the
country during the year. It was also home
base for a travelling menagerie, always a great
passion among the zoo-minded British.
Parades and clowns
The circus parade or its prototype reached
its finest flower in Renaissance Italy. The tra¬
dition of the Roman victory parade was
revived in 1500 by Cesare Borgia, and a few
years later by the Florentine Guild of Mer¬
chants. Elaborate floats, with characters from
allegory and comedy, wafted through the
streets of Florence and Milan. They included
fantastic machines, revolving spheres, ships
and globes full of singing cherubs. Leonardo
da Vinci built a mechanical lion for one such
occasion that advanced a few steps and
opened a breast full of lilies. In Siena, a
twelve-person ballet sprang out of a great
golden wolf.
The other Italian gift to the circus was the
clown. Dozens of comic types evolved in the

raucous street theatres of the Commedia dell'
Arte. The classic pair of zanni the two
comic servants can be seen to this day in
nearly every circus in the world. The harle¬
quin or clever rogue is a truly ancient
figure, descended from early representations
of the devil, while his dull-witted victim
became the gentle, moon-struck fool
Pierrot of the loose white garments and
chalk-white face so beloved of the Romantics.
Out of the ring
and into the streets
It was not until the late eighteenth century,
in London, that all this was codified and put
in a ring. The circus as we know it is uni¬
formly attributed to Philip Astley, the
horsey son of a cabinet-maker. Astley would
one day win a diamond-studded medal from
the French queen Marie-Antoinette and leave
his successors with two gorgeous amphi¬
theatres, one in London and one in Paris. He
also bequeathed a consummate spectacle of
horses, acrobats, aerialists and clowns in a
ring with a 42-foot diameter still the stan¬
dard ring dimension.
Astley's fortunes began, however, in a
muddy field near London's Westminster
Bridge. He had two horses, two fifers, and a
wife who played the drum and passed the hat.
Within two years he put a roof over his act
and called it "Astley's British Riding School".
For 150 years, the equestrian act was the
lynchpin of the European circus. Everything
depended on it. The horse was to Astley and
his heirs what the motorcycle is to a circus
like Archaos: the ritual steed that will propel
its entourage out of the mud or off the streets
into glory.
The irony of all revolutions in the circus
and elsewhere is that the new order becomes
the old. Every new circus, in a sense, is
condemned to reinvent the wheel. The Amer¬
icans invented the three-ring circus, put it
under the Big Top, and called it the Greatest
Show on Earth. Hollywood got in on the act,
and now the American circus is a synonym for
monumental kitsch. In other countries, circus
masters cultivated other values, developing
the very high art that still obtains in the old-
school circuses, from the famous Moscow
Circus to the Knies in Switzerland or the
Gruss family circus in France.
And now we have the alternative circus
the Other Circus as it has been called
that wants to bring the circus back to its
roots. The names speak for themselves: The
Tin Can Circus, the Suitcase Circus, the Kit¬
chen, Archaos. . . . The vision is ecological,
post-modern, baroquely bleak or gay.
Animal acts are out. Street theatre is in.
Many of these groups do indeed start out on
the sidewalks busking for dimes. But once
they start charging admission, or competing
for grants, or winning airtime on television,
the revolution is endangered by its own suc¬
cess like Canada's meteoric Cirque du
Soleil that began as a club to promote the
street arts in 1981. Thanks to a 97 per cent
government subsidy, in a mere ten years it
has developed a show as stellar and cold and
remote from the street as outer space.
Still the roots of the circus are always
there, under the pavement; a riot of weeds as
wild as the itch to get up on stilts or a horse or
a motorcycle and startle a crowd. The props
change. But the circus, ladies and gentlemen,
remains. O

Brightening the city m -
by Juan Carlos Langlois
18
JUAN CARLOS LANGLOIS
Is an Argentine artist whose
work has been shown at
many exhibitions in museums
and art galleries of Latin
America, North America and
Europe. Between 1977 and
1987 he was head of
UNESCO's International Fund
for the Promotion of Culture.
WITH the rapid spread of industry, the
exodus from the countryside and the
resultant transformation of the urban
landscape, city-dwellers of the second half of
the twentieth century have found themselves
living in an increasingly colourless environment.
The density of urban populations, the deve¬
lopment of complex transport systems and the
proliferation of industrial wastes are among the
factors that have contributed to the rapid rise in
atmospheric pollution. Veiled in soot, towns
and suburbs have lapsed into grimy taciturnity
as an all-pervading drabness has progressively
overcome the great urban complexes.
From the time of the first industrial revolu¬
tion, Western societies have systematically
favoured the use of sombre, neutral colours in
their towns and cities, judging them to be more
functional, and this anti-colour attitude has
been further accentuated by the desire to imitate
what were thought to be the canons of Graeco-
Roman classicism. As we now know, however,
the city-dwellers of Antiquity gave pride of
place to colour; the vision we have of the
temples and market-places of old, built solely in
white marble, is mistaken. On the contrary,
judging by the rich and subtle palette found in
the art of very ancient civilizations, the use of
colour as a symbolic language seems to have
been an important cultural development.
In more recent times in the West, Roma¬
nesque and Gothic architecture also made great
use of colour as witness the cathedrals of
Siena, Florence and Venice, with their stained-
glass windows, frescoes, mosaics, and precious
coloured marble.
The façades embellished with traditional
paintings still to be seen in many countries
today, are an indication of the extent to which
the peoples of those countries nourished their
spiritual, imaginative vision through contact
with a world of colour. The extraordinary rich¬
ness of this world is to be seen in the cities of
Islam, Greek villages, Thai Buddhist temples,
the fishing villages of the Caribbean and the
mud edifices of Africa and the Middle East, to
name but a few examples.
Sensitivity of this kind finds little place in
the monotonous environment of the great
contemporary conurbations. Fortunately, in
recent decades, the notion of bringing colour
back into building projects has been gaining
ground. The modern vision of the city implies a
rediscovery of the role of colour as an inva¬
luable aid to architects and town-planners,
enabling them either to emphasize or minimize
space and volume.
Murals and trompe-l'
Bold and judicious use of colour has an impor¬
tant role to play in street art. In the bustle of
encounter, exchange and dialogue that the
street engenders, façades, doorways, windows,
pavements and urban fittings, decked out in
colour, provide a favourable background for a
revived "urbanism" in search of a new form of
"urbanity" in its original, positive sense. The
whole city becomes more understandable and

more convivial as colour, the poetry of the
street, triumphs over drabness.
Murals and trompe-l'ceil façades are gra¬
dually making a come-back. Sometimes they
strike a chord in the collective memory by allud¬
ing to an event in the history of a district, a city
or a country, or by recalling the temporary
decors with which the streets were once trans¬
formed and embellished to mark political, reli¬
gious or artistic events.
The first great manifestations of mural art of
the twentieth century are to be found in the
work of three Mexican artists Diego Rivera
(1886-1957), José Clemente Orozco (1883-
1949) and David Alfaro Siqueiros (1896-1974).
In the 1920s, in quest of a form of art that
would be monumental and heroic yet human
and popular, they began to paint gigantic fres¬
coes that retraced the major episodes in the his¬
tory of Mexico and in the revolution of 1910.
A street in La Boca, a
working-class district of
Buenos Aires (Argentina).
Their initiative caused a great stir and
brought them many commissions for similar
works in Mexico and, later, in the United
States, where they inspired a vast programme
of publicly financed commissions designed to
provide work for American artists gravely
affected by the economic crisis of the 1930s.
More than 2,500 murals were completed over
the next few years under the aegis of the New
Deal, initiated in 1933 by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
In 1967, a mural conceived as a "collage" of
portraits, photographs and verse was created on
a derelict building in the southern suburbs of
Chicago by a group of black American artists
headed by William Walker. Entitled Wall of
Respect, it paid tribute to public figures who
had fought for civil rights for blacks. This ini¬
tiative, which was followed in other American

more and New York, marked a new point of
departure for mural painting.
During the 1960s, the creation of murals in
public places became the spearhead of an
authentic popular art movement which
responded particularly to the need for expression
felt by community groups to whom access to
visual creativity had previously been barred.
A more recent phenomenon has been the
renewed popularity of trompe-l'til, which has
developed in reaction to a form of architecture
that has shown an exaggerated predilection for
the bare wall. Widely employed from the six¬
teenth century following the adoption of geo¬
metric perspective but already used much
earlier, as the frescoes of Pompeii attest
trompe-l'fil is coming back into favour in
modern urban design as one of the best ways of
combining dream and fantasy with the useful
and the functional.
Improving the quality of life in the urban
setting is one of the prime objectives of street
art. The aim is to provide the city-dweller with
the opportunity to participate collectively in the
rebirth of a more colourful environment. By its
very nature as shared space, the street lends
itself to collective creativity. Proof of this is to
be seen across the world in the growing number
of wall paintings which young people, artists
and educators have collaborated to create.
Those whose task it is to use colour to reha
bilitate or bring life to communal space should
try to involve local people in their projects.
Whether it be in historic centres or in suburbs,
near industrial complexes located on the outs¬
kirts of cities or on big housing estates, space
must be found to allow collective creativity to
find an outlet through the use of colour, as part
of a process of renewed community dialogue
the imperative need for which becomes daily
more apparent.
Colours that calm
It is now recognized that if people are cut off
from the colours natural to their environment
they become more aggressive. To stop this
from happening, children and teenagers must
be taught how to see, to use the faculty of sight,
that key instrument of understanding. Research
has already been done on the influence of
colour on the behaviour of individuals and
communities. It should be pursued further and
its results made more widely known.
This is not to say that the time is ripe to
apply therapeutical methods based on the use
of colour. Nevertheless, many experiments
have already demonstrated the far from negli¬
gible role colour can play at key stages in many
scientific, technological and artistic activities.
There is, however, a danger that, for want of
sufficiently rigorous projects, the reintroduc¬
tion of colour into the urban landscape may

lead to a chromatic cacophony, particularly on
the edges of cities.
On the other hand, when systematic use is
made of blended colours that are predomi¬
nantly white, grey or brown, this soon results
(with the help of pollution) in a relapse into a
new drabness. Bright colours, judiciously used,
can enhance a litter-bin, a building or an entire
neighbourhood. In the same way major
construction industrial buildings, bridges,
reservoirs, road or rail infrastructures can
become the basis of a new form of decorative
expression. One example of this is the way in
which the bridge at Vierzon railway station in
France has been painted (see box). Following a
colour scheme established by artist Christiane
Groud, this imposing grey metal structure has
been repainted in strong, bright colours. The
marriage of iron and colour gives the bridge an
interest, a fascination even, rarely found in this
type of utilitarian edifice.
Colour can also help to save, rehabilitate or
give new life to areas doomed to demolition,
dereliction or anonymity. This was the case of
the working-class area of La Boca, in Buenos
Aires (Argentina) which changed totally after
its wood and corrugated iron houses were
repainted in contrasting shades. This project,
carried out some fifty years ago by the painter
Benito Quinquela Martin, himself a resident of
La Boca, gave a new sense of identity to an area
which had previously been lost in an urban
complex that today has over twelve million
inhabitants.
A district of San Francisco provides another
example of what can be done with colour. The
bright colours selected for the redecoration of a
group of Victorian-style houses strikingly
enhance their pediments, columns, friezes and
bow-windows, creating a remarkable sense of
joy and well-being. D
Sur le pont de Vierzon...
by Christiane Groud
The bridge at Vierzon railway station in central France, with its echoes of the revolutionary inno¬
vations of Gustave Eiffel, the builder of the Eiffel Tower, was looked upon with a mixture ofawe
and admiration when it was opened early in tne present century, although it also had its critics. It
is an imposing structure measuring 97 metres long and 11.7 metres wide, with a 9J-metrc-high
vertical central girder. It was designed to carry a road over the railway station, so that pedestrians
walked both across and beneath it. As the years went by, it became coated with grime pom the old
steam locomotives and was relegated to being a mere functional object that people scarcely noticed
any more.
At the imaginative prompting of the cultural centre in nearby Bourges, the bridge should now
regain its rightful place as part of the recent heritage of Vierzon and its region, asa fine example of
the use ofmetal in early twentieth-century architecture.
The first step in bringing it back to life was to give it some colour. Christiane Croud, the
person responsible for this boldproject, tells the story in her own words:
A BURST OF COLOUR
THE bridge's girders, with the impression they give of dancing on air, form a
giant sculpture which people no longer seemed to notice. I thoroughly
enjoyed the challenge of trying to present this large mctalwork structure,
which resembles a giant piece of Meccano suspended from the sky whose light it
reflects, in such a way that it would be possible to see the colours from far away.
I chose yellow first, because it is the colour of the Sun, which goes back to the
very beginning.
Then I took crimson, because of its associations with blood and violence, in
memory of the Occupation which cut France in two during World War II, when
the demarcation line passed right through Vierzon. But red also stands for love,
because there was the Resistance and the striving of people to hold up their heads
in dignity again.
The colour blue I saw as representing an outstretched hand seeking the land of
hope in the skies.
Last, I chose green, the only non-primary colour. The bridge does not cross
water but straddles railway tracks, which constantly recur in our dreams of other
places and other times. From the depths of its foundations, it pays court to the
earth and the surrounding landscape.
Just daubing on the four colours at random was out of the question because the
interlocking pattern of the girders would never have allowed it. There is something
deliberate about the way thev arc dovetailed together that creates an impression
of calm and balance. The colours I chose had to stay faithful to the innermost
movements of the giant, framework.
Perhaps I should add that, all the time I was working on the design, the bridge's
innumerable parts seemed to be playing tricks on me. I had to make a large number
of sketches before I could come to terms with this testing project, whose effects
primarily stem from the fact that the colours beat in harmony with the ironwork,
The wind, Eiffel's other close accomplice, did the rest.
This facelift formed part of Vierzon's attempt to rejuvenate its image, which
had already involved redesigning the town centre and renovating the railway sta¬
tion. The bridge, which connects the area where the schools are situated to the
heart of the old town, could at the same time be said to create a bond between the
generations. It is now a more agreeable sight for its regular users, as well as for visi¬
tors and the occasional passer-by. Through the sheer impact of its colours, it seems
to stand out in relief, brightening up the landscape and putting to shame the drab¬
ness of everyday life. O

übe Chicanosr-muralists with a message
by Annick Treguer
"Why paint in the street?"
22
"Because there aren't any museums in Los Angeles"
THIS snatch of dialogue between Chicano
artists in Los Angeles helps to explain
the explosion of mural painting in the
United States since the 1970s, particularly in
California and throughout the southwest.
Mural painting was the first manifestation
of what is now generally referred to as Chi¬
cano art. Chicanos are people of Mexican
origin who are brought up and live in the
United States. The word came into general
currency in the 1960s. Previously it had only
been used in the "barrios" the Mexican dis¬
tricts of the towns and cities in the southwest
of the United States. Mexican-Americans
themselves adopted it as a gesture of pride in
face of American society, on the sidelines of
which they mostly tend to live. As the French
writer Pascal Letellier has noted, "it was a
time when all kinds of minorities came to the
fore, the time of the struggle for civil rights,
the era of opposition to the Viet Nam war,"
when "the Chicanos discovered an identity
and an ideology, aided by the student move¬
ment in the Californian universities".
The muralists of the Chicano movement
took over the visual language of the young
Chicanos of the barrios, giving it new stature
as they transformed and embellished the
urban landscape. In the early 1970s the walls
of newly-constructed buildings served as huge

canvases to bring word of the Chicano move¬
ment to the residents of the Mexican commu¬
nities. The walls became living museums, car¬
rying a message everyone could understand.
Graphics had always been a form of self-
expression used spontaneously by young Chi¬
canos, who would cover walls with graffiti
and with "placas" words or symbols that
identified themselves and their gangs. It was
easy to dismiss this activity as vandalism, but
in fact it expressed the frustration of margina¬
lized groups and frustrated individuals. In the
same way, the mural artists began, via their
support for the Chicano political and cultural
movement, to speak out for a culture that had
long been forgotten.
The young Chicano artists got together to
work with the local barrio communities.
Pascal Letellier describes the great frescoes
that resulted as "a savage, mystical, realistic,
flamboyant iconography that links up with
the great tradition of Mexican mural art of the
1930s, with Orozco, Rivera and Siqueiros".
They also set up group workshops. Cultural
centres of the "raza" (race or ethnic group),
Hispanic America's unifying concept, became
more and more common. This was a golden
age of community art, art in the street.
Two Californian communities provide
good illustrations of what was going on. The
murals produced in each were the result of
close collaboration between the residents,
both young and not so young, and the artists.
One is Estrada Courts, an East Los Angeles
barrio-ghetto that consists of small public-
housing blocks and has the highest concentra¬
tion of Chicanos and Mexicans in California.
The other is Chicano Park in southern San
Diego, a district at the intersection of two
freeways that cut the Chicano barrio in two.
Estrada Courts
The appearance of Estrada Courts improved
noticeably between 1973 and 1976, when
murals were painted on a number of blind walls.
Directed by artist Gato Felix, this renewal pro¬
ject was originally intended not just to make the
barrio more attractive but also to provide an
outlet for the energy and talents of young, out-
of-work Chicanos who were drawing graffiti
that were in many cases destructive. The murals
depicted Mexican subjects, boosting local
people's confidence by putting them back in
touch with the roots of a culture that was
largely ignored in North American school
curricula. In this way aesthetics and culture
were brought together.
Pre-Columbian themes, intended to remind
Chicanos of their noble origins, are common.
There are motifs from the Aztec codices, gods
from the Aztec pantheon, allusions to the Spa¬
nish conquest and images of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, a cherished Mexican icon.
Two murals represent important moments
in the history of the Chicano movement, linking
Estrada Courts to recent history. Protest ban¬
ners of the years 1965-75 float on one façade
over a bucolic scene representing the life of a
poor Mexican agricultural labourer before his
arrival in the United States. Another splendidly
recalls the Chicanos' ethnic and cultural origins:
it shows an Aztec, a conquistador, a Mexican, a

ANNICK TREGUER,
who teaches Spanish at the
University of Paris III
(Sorbonne Nouvelle) has
been interested in the culture
of the Chicanos for many
years. Most of her research
is focused on Chicano
theatre and murals, on which
she has lectured in France
and the United States. She
took part in an exhibition on

scarf he wears round his head, descending from
a pyramid to join hands in planting the flag of
the Chicano movement, a black eagle on a red
background, on American soil.
Apart from these few exceptions, which
reflect the political concerns of the Mexican
minority in the United States, nearly all the
fine murals in Estrada Courts are purely deco¬
rative, depicting jungle animals, fish, mountain
landscapes and similar subjects.
Chicano Park
The Chicano Park paintings are very different
in the sense that they have a special place in
the history of the district where they were
produced. They represent some of the finest
examples of popular mural art, directly inheri¬
ting the great Mexican tradition of the 1920s
and the 1930s.
On two occasions the inhabitants of the
San Diego barrio were evicted and expro¬
priated to make way for the building of new
roads. They resisted actively, and in 1970 their
campaign to prevent the heart of the barrio
from being dehumanized or destroyed was
supported by militants of the Chicano move¬
ment. In the same year the city authorities
abandoned their attempts to -locate a scrap-
iron depot there and restored the district to its
inhabitants.
In these circumstances a historical monu¬
ment was born. What had been a hideous
forest of concrete pillars soon became a plea¬
sant and attractive place, a park decorated
with paintings of remarkable beauty whose
subject-matter was critical, even subversive.
Each year the 1970 victory is commemorated
by a festival and political meetings, which pro¬
vide an opportunity to start new paintings.
Here too pre-Columbian motifs are plen¬
tiful, among them an extraordinary pillar
representing the Aztec earth-goddess Coat¬
licue. Such images are not merely decorative:
they increase the prestige of Aztec and Mayan
culture, notably through depictions of pyra¬
mids, a recurrent symbol of the great Meso-
American civilizations, and of muscular
Indians crowned with feathers, emblems of
nobility and wisdom.
The murals also reflect a budding political
consciousness. The two frescoes decorating the
freeway access ramps are a veritable gallery of
portraits of revolutionary heroes, featuring
important moments in Mexican and Chicano
history. They provide a selective vision of
recent international history. Alongside César
Chavez, the non-violent defender of the rights
of Mexican agricultural workers, who is shown
addressing Chicano crowds, there are land¬
scapes and episodes from the Mexican revolu¬
tion interspersed with portraits of Picasso,
Santana, Che Guevara, Diego Rivera, Benito
Juárez, Hidalgo and Fidel Castro.
Pictures of the struggles of peasants and
. workers from the Mexican past, among them
Zapata's guerrillas, are an incitement to resist
discrimination. Some of the motifs are given a
Chicano gloss: putting Mexican images in the
new North American environment helps rein¬
force Chicano social cohesion. Two symbols
that are ubiquitous at Chicano Park have a
similar function. One is the Virgin of Guada¬
lupe, who plays a unifying role for Chicanos
and for Mexican immigrants. The other is the
flag of César Chavez's movement, bearing the
black Aztec eagle. Images reflecting another
Chicano concern, for an educational system
suited to the needs of their children and of
Mexican immigrants, are also common
An authentic pictorial tradition and a set of
historic circumstances have come together to
make the walls of Los Angeles and of San
Diego, new cities of seemingly limitless
growth, canvases that express vibrantly the
long-standing and ever-growing Mexican pre¬
sence in the United States. O

Getting the show on the road
by Françoise Grund
An Indian painting (c. 1850)
depicting Raja Ram Singh
and his son in a procession.
PEOPLE take to the streets for many rea¬
sons. They may be angry or afraid, or
they may want to take part in a civic or
religious festival. Often the idea for a festival
comes from above from the authorities, who
invite the people to go out into the streets. Such
events are politically inspired, for a festival can
be an astute way of arousing public opinion
while also keeping it carefully channeled. This
type of festival provides an opportunity for the
relationship between the people and their rulers
to be assessed.
To organize a festival, the authorities
simply give the word. The people are free, for
a time, to take control of their surroundings
and bring fresh ideas to the urban environ¬
ment. Who could refuse such an offer?
At once the festival machinery swings into
action. Its efficiency will provide a measure of
the city's vitality, and will also convey a coded
message about its power structure. While the
authorities seek to mobilize enthusiasm for a
memorable achievement, the citizens have the
chance to express their creativity by devising
heroic combinations of sound, movement and
(if the festival takes place at night) light. Theirs
is a collective effort, though it is normally made
up of individual flashes of inspiration.
Parades and pilgrimages
Ancient Rome had its triumphal processions,
for which architects, armourers, and scenery
and costume designers devised visual and
sound effects intended to stir up patriotism and
make the spectators feel gratitude towards the
victors and hatred or pity for the vanquished.
The processions became such important events
that stone steles and commemorative arches
were built for them.
Renaissance Italy staged sumptuous cele¬
brations for the gods of the theatre. Extraordi¬
nary processions wheeled machines, tanks of
scented water, monumental thrones carrying
the stars of the first operas, dance-floors carried

on men's backs, and catapults made out of pre¬
cious wood and designed to hurl human can-
nonballs would make their way through the
city to the sound of silver trumpets. Hundreds
of actors took part, wearing make-up and all
kinds of finery, their heads crowned with vine-
leaves and feathers. From time to time they
would stop to declaim verses or intone eulogies.
For centuries past northern India's holy
city of Benares has restaged the great Hindu
folk-drama of Ramlila. Each year millions of
pilgrims cram together on five successive
nights to watch the combat between good and
evil. Actors and audience mingle in an arena
that is more than a kilometre long. Lofty
mobile platforms enable the spectators, who
know the text and the music by heart, to live
every moment of the play. The crowds, the
dust and the noise provide a benediction. The
spectators feel they have been in the presence
of the gods and have acted alongside them,
and when they go home on the morning of the
sixth day, they are convinced that they are the
better for their outing.
Something similar may have happened in
Malta in the sixteenth and seventeenth centu¬
ries, when the Christian Knights Hospitallers
took to the streets on the orders of their Grand
Master and held a military and religious proces¬
sion that was executed with music and style.
The knights sang and acted, and performed
operas at certain specially built sites. Part of the
power structure thus turned its hand once a
year to street theatre. Power had to be publicly
manifested to strengthen the people's faith.
Carnivals or concert-halls?
Nowadays towns and cities are taking over the
state's role as sponsors of outdoor events. A
mayor can affirm his independence and autho¬
rity by organizing and paying for a spectacle
that will inevitably be covered in the media.
Even the Rio carnival is today sponsored by
the city authorities, in conjunction with the
Brazilian Ministry of Tourism. There are
grandstands packed with European and Amer¬
ican visitors who pay to spend hours watching
thousands of dancers in spangled costumes, the
winners of the samba-school contests. A more
spontaneous carnival takes place in the work¬
ing-class districts of Rio, but in a sense the
official parade is a betrayal of its origins now
that it has become competitive and people have
to pay to watch it. At least the stars of the show
today belong to the most underprivileged
classes, whereas at the beginning of the century
it was the wealthy who took to the streets in a
brightly costumed annual display of power.
The Fiesta del Gran Poder (Festival of the
Almighty) in La Paz (Bolivia) has only existed
officially since 1985. In fact the Indian popula¬
tion of the poorer quarters high on the hillsides
had long held an annual procession in honour
of a figure of Christ the Almighty in a small
local church, which they credited with miracu¬
lous powers. The procession was traditionally a
modest affair, followed principally by Aymara
Indians wearing masks and woollen shawls. Its
focal point was a masked and costumed dancer
who would gyrate convulsively to exorcise the
sins of the little community.
All that is now changed. The event has
become an organized fiesta that takes over the
whole city. The sacred procession has been
turned into a light-hearted pageant featuring
folklore groups from many countries. Con¬
tained within security barriers and overlooked

by covered grandstands for official guests, it
follows a route that ends in the fashionable dis¬
tricts down in the valley. Television cameras
record the proceedings, which spectators are no
longer permitted to join. Masked dancers still
take part, and they are as beautiful and impres¬
sive as ever; but now they only serve to bring
back colourful memories of the past, and to
give tourists the chance to take dramatic snap¬
shots against the backdrop of the eternal snows
of the Cordillera Real.
In France the Festival of Music held each
year on 21 June has become a national event
since 1981. The streets, bridges, open spaces,
gardens and quays of Paris are transformed
for the day into improvised concert-halls
where amateur musicians of all kinds, from
flautists to opera singers, can perform in
public. A delighted city savours its creative
talents, and passers-by suddenly discover that
they are music-lovers and musicians.
Yet each year more and more platforms
and stages are put up in the most fashionable
quarters of the city for professional musicians
and star singers performing for money. The
concerts are nonetheless free, and the public

flocks to them. Meanwhile the amateur flau¬
tists still play in the streets and alleyways, and
in the suburbs and in provincial towns. Yet as
the festival increasingly becomes a media
event, the popular enthusiasm of earlier years
is waning. People's hearts are no longer in it.
The Festival has grown out of cheerful and
spontaneous anarchy into an organized event.
Advance booking, complete with favoured
access for the privileged, has replaced the
freedom and spontaneity of earlier days. This
urge for order and stability is in marked
contrast to the original intention, which was
to encourage creativity and self-expression,
not to produce a performance. In this case, the
authorities have been upstaged by the media,
the artists' agents and record companies.
Winning back the streets
The Bread and Puppet Theatre in the United
States and India's Jagran Company are examples
of initiatives which go against the trend for state
sponsorship.
It was during the Viet Nam War that Peter
Schumann took his troupe out onto the streets
of New York. An important event in theatre
history, this original step had a considerable
impact in the United States. In the next few
years, its huge skeletons and monstrous man-
nikins wearing gas masks, performing to the
sound of sirens and lugubrious drumming,
became familiar sights in the busiest parts of
Manhattan. The puppets carried gigantic
images of death and rocked simulated cadavers
of Vietnamese babies. The attention of Ame¬
rica was caught by this protest whose imagery
was as violent as its intentions were pacific.
The Bread and Puppet Theatre made a
comeback in 1975, with a protest against the
US bicentenary celebrations. The formula was
unchanged, mixing masked actors and puppets,
some of them five metres high.
In India, Alok Roy followed a similar path.
He took his troupe of twenty actors, all of
them skilled mimes and musicians, to the slums
of Delhi and later to those of other Indian
cities. He would assemble a crowd largely
consisting of women and children around a
communal tap or on a disused railway line or
piece of wasteland. The actors' faces were plas¬
tered with white make-up and had grossly
exaggerated features, so that from a distance
they looked like clowns. The troupe employed
simplified and deliberately coarse gestures,
pantomime routines and acrobatics to protest
against everyday social injustices. Some of their
shows, which were short and more or less
improvised to encourage audience participa¬
tion, gave advice on nutrition and health, for
example showing how to cook spinach (which
is very cheap in India) or to boil water. Jokes
and slapstick helped spread the message; there
was nothing sententious about this theatre of
the slums.
Private initiatives both, these isolated
attempts to reclaim public spaces were suc¬
cessful not just in their own countries but also
elsewhere. The two groups set such high
artistic standards and their impact was so
strong that governments did not object to their
going from strength to strength. But how many
other similar ventures around the world have
been held back or else nipped in the bud?

Sri Lanka's
wayside theatre
by A. J. Gunawardana
28
A. J. GUNAWARDANA,
of Sri Lanka, is director of the
Institute of Aesthetic Studies
at the University of Kelaniva,
Sri Lanka. He has been a
contributing editor of The
Drama Review (New York)
and is well known as a critic
and screenwriter in his
country.
IN Sri Lanka, as in many other South Asian
countries, open-air entertainments are staged
in cities, towns and villages throughout the
land. In origin, style and content they can be
broadly divided into traditional and modern,
but the borderline between the two groups is
often unclear.
For over 2,000 years, Buddhism has been
the principal shaping force of Sri Lankan cul¬
ture. Sinhala-speaking Buddhists make up
nearly 70 per cent of the population and pre¬
serve patterns of worship based on the time-
honoured conventions and observances of
their faith. So do the Tamils, who form the
minority segment of the population and are
largely Hindu.
Public events connected with religious
worship in Sri Lanka, whether Buddhist or
Hindu, tend to take the form of processions,
or peraheras as they are called in Sinhala. The
best-known of these processions is the Dalada
Perahera, a magnificent nocturnal pageant fea¬
turing caparisoned elephants and traditional
dancers which is held annually in the streets of
Kandy to honour the sacred tooth relic of the
Buddha. This act of homage to the Buddha
attracts thousands of devotees and sightseers.
Many other processions, although less
grand than the Dalada Perahera, are staged at
regular intervals under the aegis of Buddhist
temples, shrines and other places of worship
dedicated to minor gods and regional deities.
Although firmly religious and devotional,
they often incorporate secular and sometimes
even slightly profane features. Peraheras are
public acts of oblation, but they are also
meant to delight the eye and the ear.
A typical perahera today consists of ele¬
phants, dancers and devotees (men, women
and children dressed in white), and may
include costumed characters such as veddahs
or wild men. These characters act in ways desi¬
gned to highlight their principal attributes or
take part in tableaux depicting familiar epi¬
sodes from history and religious lore. The
Poson Perahera, which memorializes the intro
duction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka during the
reign of Emperor Asoka of India, often incor¬
porates a tableau showing the first meeting
between the King of Lanka and Emperor
Asoka's ecclesiastical emissary.
Sri Lankan street diversions reach their
high point during Vesak, the most notable fes¬
tival in the Buddhist calendar. Vesak, or Wai-
sakha as it is known in Pali, the liturgical lan¬
guage of Buddhism, is the full Moon in the
month of May which is reckoned to mark the
birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha.
The most striking aspect of the Vesak cele¬
bration, apart from its strictly religious side, is
the centrality it accords to illuminations.
Vesak is in effect a "Festival of Lights". No
Buddhist home, however humble, would fail
to light a few lamps or lanterns during the

nights of Vesak. In their most characteristic
form, Vesak illuminations consist of multiple
arrays of electric lights that are integrated into
high, elaborately decorated, arch-shaped
façades known as thoranas. The lights go on
and off, change colour and outline in cyclical
configurations, and offer a much-loved source
of visual enjoyment and wonder to the people.
But the thoranas are more than just a light
show. They recount stories from the Buddhist
canon, notably the Jataka Tales or Birth Stories
of the Buddha. A typical thorana displays the
main episodes of a story through a series of
painted panels, like a kind of strip cartoon.
Nowadays there is also a sound-track with
voices for the main characters, a descriptive
linking narration and a background musical
score. The result might be described as a piece

of radio drama tagged on to a set of primitive
naturalistic paintings. Essentially an urban phe¬
nomenon, the thorana is an amalgam of popular
art media that caters to both religious sentiment
and the public taste for grand spectacles.
At the time of Vesak, wayside theatre and
mime performances are also staged on specially
erected platforms tall enough for the spectators
to have a clear view of what is going on. No
money is charged, although contributions may
be solicited from the audience.
Buddhist parables and Jataka tales provide
the subject matter for Vesak theatre, just as
they do for thorana presentations. The stories
are simply and straightforwardly told. The dia¬
logue, a blend of the colloquial and the high-
flown, is interspersed with songs. The entire

played back through loudspeakers, exactly as in
the case of the thoranas. The acting is largely
confined to gestures and lip movements.
Modern street theatre
While peraheras, the Vesak thoranas and
Vesak theatre articulate received beliefs and
value systems and assert a sense of continuity,
in recent years a form of modern street drama
has developed in Sri Lanka which breaks with
the past and offers a critical commentary on
society, on politics, culture and religion in
short, on all aspects of contemporary life.
Modern street theatre in Sri Lanka owes its
existence to the commitment of a dedicated
man named Gamini K. Haththotuwegama. A
university teacher of literature, Mr. Haththo¬
tuwegama is inspired by a vision of theatre as
a social instrument which, he believes, can lift
the veils of falsehood and hypocrisy which
shroud many areas of contemporary life.
Seventeen years ago, Haththotuwegama
founded the Wayside and Open Theatre
Group as a workshop in actor training and
improvization techniques. Before long, the
participants most of them young, questing,
impatient with the limits of mainstream
theatre were performing out in the open,
away from the rules and rigidities of the
enclosed playhouse and the proscenium arch.
They went out to act for people who had nei¬
ther the means nor the leisure to go to the
theatre.
A typical street theatre programme consists
of a number of short pieces, each lasting less
than an hour. A play may be sparked off by a

recent happening or it may be an old tale
reinterpreted in the light of current events.
One example of the Group's approach is its
reworking of the "Emperor's New Clothes"
motif in which the well-known parable is
placed in the context of the modern mass
media. While Haththotuwegama himself
writes most of the "texts", there is a substantial
amount of collaboration, and plays grow,
change and take unexpected turns during per¬
formance. The texts include "free spaces" that
can be filled with fresh material according to
need. The Group is adept at getting up plays
for special occasions at short notice, plays
which favour liberation and solidarity themes.
There has been a high turnover in the
membership of the company. Young people
come and go, but a loyal core has remained.
Street theatre is not done for money, although
a collection may be taken to cover basic
expenses such as travel and food.
One of many stories Haththotuwegama
likes to tell about the Group's adventures is
about the time when its members invaded a
seminar sponsored by the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization of the United Nations
(Fao) and acted out a skit which mocked the
delegates for indulging in excellent lunches
and dinners. Fao took the point, and the per¬
formed "text" was later printed in the Fao
Quarterly Bulletin. The Group mounted a
similar offensive at a Family Planning
Convention by presenting an "anti-pill" play
which portrayed the humanitarian dimension
often overlooked in social engineering.
Haththotuwegama's brand of theatre,

though it only exists on a small scale as yet, is
seen by its proponents as appropriate for a
country lacking the facilities found in affluent
societies and where the mass of the people are
too poor to afford the price of a theatre ticket.
While such claims may be debatable, Hath¬
thotuwegama and his co-workers have
chalked up an impressive list of achievements.
The very fact that they have been able to carry
on for seventeen years is itself no mean
accomplishment, given the risks involved in
staging itinerant outdoor performances. The
Group is run on a shoestring. It has no proper
rehearsal facilities and is too poor to rent any.
Yet, whatever the material shortfall, it has
abided by what Haththotuwegama calls "a
sacred principle" its plays are never staged
for money.
The gift of theatre
The members of the Group go to the people
bearing the gift of theatre with them, and des¬
pite their undisguised political intentions and
the difficult and trying conditions under which
they work, their shows are entertaining, ins¬
tructive and unpretentious. They induce a
mood of camaraderie and reduce the formal
distance between performer and audience. The
style is polyglot dance, song, grotesqueries,
mime, straight dialogue, spicy asides. Nearly
every tool in the actor's repertory is employed.
The cutting edge is sharp.
Paradoxically, by defying the tenets of the
contemporary mainstream stage, Haththotu¬
wegama and his associates in the Wayside and
Open Theatre movement have established a
connection with the pre-modern theatrical
culture of Sri Lanka. The pre-modern theatres,
several of which still survive, were community
enterprises largely untainted by commerce.
Their performances were also, for the most
part, staged outdoors in public precincts or
compounds. The Wayside and Open Theatre
Group fits into the pre-modern mould in
these respects, but its world-view is radically
different.
Is wayside theatre a passing phenomenon?
Haththotuwegama thinks not. He points to
the support received by the Group from spon¬
sors in all parts of Sri Lanka, and the marvel¬
lous response the plays generate. Ultimately,
however, much will depend on the Group's
capacity to attract and retain new blood and
produce durable clones elsewhere in the
country. Wayside theatre is not an easy life. It
calls for deep social commitment as well as
theatrical talent. The two rarely go together in
the modern world.
Be that as it may, the Wayside and Open
Theatre Group is a desirable presence in Sri
Lanka's theatrical arena. For quite apart from
the meaning and impact of its growing reper¬
toire, it provides a necessary counterpoint to
the placid aesthetic certainties of the conven¬
tional stage. O

Cité de la Creation
In 1920, the French architect and urban planner Tony Gamier (1869-1948) des¬
igned a low-cost housing scheme in an area of Lyons, one of France's largest cities.
The scheme, which was completed in 1933, was the first complex of its type built
in Europe. On account of its rational and self-contained design, this "Cité indus¬
trielle" is considered to be one of the first examples of twentieth-century urban
architecture. With its almost 1,600 housing units spread over some twelve blocks,
it is home to a low-income working class population of upwards of 4,000 people,
most of them elderly. The quality they have in common is that they have
remained loyal to the environment in which they live.
For the past four years, the estate has been undergoing rehabilitation by the
Lyons branch of the Ol'Cl II. M, the official agency for low-rent housing schemes.
Its inhabitants have made a point of ensuring that the work being done is a model
of its kind, not only to preserve the memory of the place where they live but to
project a new image, give it a fresh lease of life and add to its traditional reputa¬
tion as an area where people are welcoming and live together in harmony side-by-
side. One of the offshoots of the rehabilitation exercise has been the creation of
the Tony Gamier Urban Museum, which has been set up on the estate at the ins¬
tigation of a committee formed by the tenants and has been designed and built by
a team of painters and sculptors from Lyons, the "Cité de la Création". The
Museum has sixteen frescoes covering 4,000 square metres of wall-space and dis¬
playing extracts, in the form of plates and sketches, from some of the futuristic
urban designs which Tony Garnier produced between 1904 and 1917. These are
set out in an open-air concourse of novel design. The rehabilitation programme
also provides for a pedestrian precinct, a documentation centre on Tony Garnier's
work and a specimen apartment from the ninetccn-thirties.
In 1991, Unesco designated the Tony Gamier Urban Museum as a project
coming under the auspices of the World Decade for Cultural Development on
three grounds: the wealth of its architectural and artistic heritage; the originality
of the museum design; and the mobilization of the inhabitants of the quarter in
the bid to revive its ' culture".
Those involved in the project unanimously agreed to give it an international
dimension. For this purpose, six painters and sculptors from different geo-cultural
regions will be allowed a free hand to use six wall-surfaces that are still vacant for
frescoes on the theme of the "Cité idéale", in keeping with the far-sighted projec¬
tions of Tony Gamier. O
This aerial plan of a project by Tony Gamier has been painted on a wall
of a housing block in the Tony Gamier Urban Museum in Lyons (France). It illustrates two
major features of Garnier's work: the orthogonal and hierarchical organization of the road
system and the grouping of dwellings into rectangular blocks.

Art goes underground
by Marianne Ström
Below: Tsertanovskaya
station, Moscow (CIS);

above right: Vastra Skogen
station, Stockholm
(Sweden).
THE year 1863 was a milestone in the
history of London. It saw the opening
of the Metropolitan Railway, the city's
first underground line. Having an under¬
ground railway, variously called the tube,
the subway, the underground or the Métro,
was soon to become the hallmark of a pros¬
perous modern city. A century later, in
1963, twenty-eight of the world's cities
were the proud possessors of this form of
mass transit system. Today they number
almost 120, and it is thought that by the end
of the century there will be more than 150
of them worldwide.
The coming of the subway revolutio¬
nized the aesthetics of urban life. Many of
the early stations were designed by indivi¬
dual architects such as Otto Wagner, who
created the thirty-six pavilions of Vienna's
S-Bahn, and Leslie W. Green, who designed
more than fifty stations for the London
tube. French architect Hector Guimard
created 141 entrances to the Paris Métro. The
eleven stations of the Budapest Földalatti, the
first underground railway in continental
Europe, were also designed by a single
person. As time went by, however, subway
stations came to be built in prestressed

concrete to a standard design by teams of
engineers.
In the last few decades the subway has
again become a fashionable showcase for the
arts. When stations are built or modernized,
the commission usually goes to well-known
artists or architects to whom it brings consi¬
derable prestige. In many cases, perhaps, the
encounter is only a brief one, a monologue
rather than a dialogue. Where there is a real
meeting, however, and the chemistry bet¬
ween artists and architects is successful, a
long-term dialogue ensues.
Painted stations and grottoes
The grotto-stations which make up a third
of the stations on the Stockholm subway are
a remarkable example of collaboration bet¬
ween the arts. Hewn from granite between
twenty and forty metres underground, they
are the work of individual artists or groups
of artists. Each one is different from the
rest. All they have in common is their cave¬
like character. The history of sport is the
keynote of the decoration at the Stadium
station. The style is straightforward and the
theme is presented in unmistakable fashion.
It would be hard to imagine a traveller get¬
ting off at the wrong station, even if he
could not read its name.
Let us take the Brussels Métro and stop
off at Hankar station. The walls and ceilings
are decorated with a vigorous painting exe¬
cuted in bright, strident colours. The striking
communicative power of this monumental
work, Notre temps, by Roger Somville, pre¬
vents it from being overwhelmed by the
heavy concrete volumes of the architecture.
The play of light
Toronto's Glencairn Station is a tour de
force of lighting as much as architecture.
Light pouring through stained glass vaulting,
painted in vivid colours by Rita Letendre
and entitled Joy, suffuses the whole station.
At Yorkdale, another Toronto station,
Michael Hiden's Rainbow is a veritable fire¬
work display. An electric system consisting
of fluorescent tubes inserted into the arches
of the vault lights up from one end of the
station to the other whenever a train passes.
In the United States, at Atlanta's Civic
Center station, we find the same play of
light, but this time it is natural. Two mainte¬
nance passages run beneath glazed arcades.
To camouflage them, artist Paul Freundt,
working in collaboration with the architects
(Reynolds and Partners), made twin
painted-steel sculptures, each measuring

Palaces and treasures
Some of the stations on the Moscow under¬
ground can only be described as palatial.
One of them is Komsomolskaya station,
with its resplendent baroque decor and
fairy-tale lighting. Designed by architects
Shchusev, Mokorin and Zabolotnaya, it was
built in the 1950s. At Tsertanovskaya sta¬
tion, built in 1983, a woman architect, Alio-
shina, has created an area where the light
effects bring to mind Gothic cathedrals.
Avtovo station in St. Petersburg, with its
magnificent portico, is equally impressive.
Lille, in France, is a city which has only
recently built itself a Métro, in this case a
fully automatic driverless "ghost train".
Here too the arts have been given plenty of
exposure.
Louvre station on the Paris Métro dis¬
plays copies of masterpieces in the museum
above. When it was inaugurated in 1967 it
sparked off a fashion for "cultural" stations.
In Rome the works of art that cover the
walls of Termini station are genuine ancient
mosaics, while in Lyons (France), Gallo-
Roman remains unearthed during excava¬
tions for the Métro are on show at Bellecour
station. Architecture has pride of place in
Mexico City, where travellers at Pino
Suárez station can admire the base of an
Aztec pyramid.
Subways are increasingly being used as a
meeting place of the arts. In the last decade,
the London tube has embarked on a vast
renovation and modernization programme.
Similar schemes are underway in the Paris
Métro and the German U-Bahns, where art
exhibitions are often held. Each subway city
has a special feature of its own. The tradi¬
tional tilework for which Portugal is cele¬
brated is prominently displayed in the sta¬
tions of Lisbon. The New York subway is
being redecorated. Beneath the vigilant eye
of "Arts on the Line", the Boston subway is
setting off on new rails. Chicago's overhead
railway, the Loop, remains faithful to ks fin
de siècle image.
Our last train stops in Hong Kong,
where the subway system is so smart that
only the well-heeled can afford to take it.
Here the subway has ceased to be the
"popular" mode of transport it has always
been since it first puffed its way into the
history of public transport. O

Music out of doors by François Bensignor
Barrel-organ players in late
19th-century Germany.
HE is below my window now, at noon.
With the coming of the fine weather he
has returned to his old haunts, like the
swallows. He takes up his pitch at the cross¬
roads in the sunlight, cranks the handle of his
barrel-organ and sings the songs of old Paris,
songs of the Commune and the people and
love affairs that go wrong. I find myself
almost unconsciously singing along with the
choruses, as if I had always known them. But
in fact who does still remember these old
songs now, if not some inner voice or this ana¬
chronistic street musician?
Down there on the pavement, people arc
wrapped up in their own problems. Few stop.
Some smile as they pass by; others walk on
with their heads down, scowling. The singer is
unfazed. He just puts another perforated strip
in the machine and goes on singing. Some¬
times he is off key, but never mind. . . . Cars
pass, office workers head for lunch, gangs of
children form and disperse. Sometimes
someone even stops to put a coin in the cup
fixed to the barrel-organ.
But in the age of the Walkman, the street
musician is playing not so much for the
money as to keep alive a culture attacked on
every side by the modern world of property
developers and traffic jams. His long hair and
red scarf, the ragamuffin's cap pulled down
over one eye, may look like fancy dress, but
they are really a way of letting passers-by

know that Paris still belongs to the people
who live in it. For the old street-songs are part
of its soul, and that soul will never die as long
as the melodies of the past can still be heard.
From street-singer to rap artist
In the old days when the wireless was just a
hobbyist's plaything, street-singers served as
loudspeakers, popularizing the latest songs
and selling the sheet music that went with
them. At home after Sunday dinner, families
learned the tunes by heart. Paris used to sing.
In Jamaica, the sound systems of the 1950s
and '60s served a similar commercial function.
Perched on trucks parked strategically at cross¬
roads, in markets or shopping streets, they
boomed out the latest hits. A disc jockey would
improvise a sales pitch over the microphone to
the.beat of an instrumental number. Although
the original intention was to sell records, several
musical techniques grew incidentally out of this
custom, notably "toasting" improvised
rhythmic monologues spoken over the instru¬
mental sections of a record and talkovers, in
which the disc jockey completely reworked the
track, substituting his own rhythmically
stressed words in place of the lyrics of the ori¬
ginal recording. Toasting demanded the skills of
the fairgound barker or street hawker; talkovers
were spoken art, rhythm turned into music.
These two Jamaican inventions served as
models for "rap", today's street music par
excellence. Like other musicians before them,
rappers developed their art in the street before
they had access to production facilities and
commercial outlets. In New York, in the
Bronx and Harlem, the first rappers began in
the mid-1970s to organize "block parties" in
the streets for the inhabitants of blocks of flats.
A sound system would be installed on the
pavement or maybe in the window of an apart¬
ment. Disc jockeys challenged one another
over the turntables, rappers competed in verbal
virtuosity, dancers devised wild movements,
graffiti artists brought colour to dirty walls.
Urban soundscapes
Shut up in a club, street music loses its special
identity. In a recording studio, even when
simply relayed by microphone, it has to pass
through the Caudine Forks of electronics,
which rob it of some of its vitality. Street
music can never really be replicated, for it is
an art of the moment, inseparable from every¬
thing that is going on around it at the time of
its creation. It needs space.
Some groups have found ways of integra¬
ting this urban dimension into their music.
Anybody who has attended one of Urban
Sax's performances will recall how this troupe
of saxophonists, dehumanized behind their
white masks, literally take over the venue in
which they are appearing. They have played
from gondolas in Venice, slid down from the
roof of the town hall of Groningen in the
Netherlands, taken possession of a square in
Stockholm and conjured up strange water
effects for the Neptune Fountain in the park
of the Palace of Versailles.
Their strategy is that of the spider weaving
its web. Groups of saxophonists move among
the crowd, playing repeated phrases in har¬
mony with one another. The audience is
wrapped up in a strange world in which
sounds come from far and near, some so close
as to brush up against the listener. As the per¬
formance continues, the spectators' sense of
musical space becomes more precise. However
well they may know the spot where the per¬
formance is taking place, it soon starts to feel
unfamiliar. Its volumes stretch or become
fixed. The music makes the street breathe,
gives it body.
Before the development of this kind of
modern participation art, brass bands, parades
and traditional processions (themselves often
sources of inspiration for artists) provided as
they still do a similar sort of social theatre
for the cities. In this case, however, the sur¬
rounding architecture shapes the soundscape
more than the movement of the sound-source.
For example, the atmosphere of a Puerto-
Rican carnival coming down Fifth Avenue in
New York between two rows of skyscrapers
is very different from that of a festival of poly¬
phonic vocal music in the pedestrian precinct
of the old walled town of Bonifacio in Cor¬
sica. Even though the participants may share
the same enthusiasm, the architectural sur¬
roundings profoundly modify the effect pro¬
duced on the audience.
In the first case, the diffusion of the sound
along the immense straight avenues creates a

feeling of evanescence, a fleeting vision that
disappears as soon as the spectator leaves the
parade. The event is just one of thousands that
have no connection with one another. The
sound is channeled between icily reflecting
glass façades running in parallel lines that look
as though they should meet at infinity.
In the Corsican festival, on the other hand,
everything contributes to an intense sense of
communion: the narrow streets, the stone
paving, the carved wooden doors, even the intri¬
cate web of houses and passages surrounded by
its ring of fortifications. Carried by the wind,
the sound of the chants penetrates every nook
and cranny of this labyrinth, to such good effect
that no-one can ignore the event, which
becomes the whole community's business.
The wandering voice
The melodies of the sevillanas that accompany
Andalusian pilgrims each year just before
Whitsun on the long road towards the Virgin
of El Rocío move with the procession out of
the city streets to the countryside beyond.
There they mix with birdsong, the squeaking
of the wheels of the decorated ox-carts, the
clatter of horses bearing costumed cavaliers
with their girls riding pillion behind them, the
murmur of streams heading seaward through
the sands of the Guadalquivir delta. The street
turns first into the open road, then becomes a
pathway, then a track. The music is the more
profound for it. It has a faraway lilt that
recalls the music of nomads.
I should like to recall here an incident
engraved on my memory as the most poignant
musical experience I have ever had. I was tra¬
velling in Afghanistan at the time. The local
bus I was riding had stopped for the night,
and along with the other passengers I had got
off to find something to eat. The road lay
along the rocky Tarnak valley. The sun had
gone down behind a barrier of low, eroded
hills stretching far away in the west. We tra¬
vellers made do with a simple meal eaten in
the open air on a large paved terrace sur¬
rounded by a low wall and lit by a few light-
bulbs. After I had gulped down my food, I
decided to go and stretch my legs.
Away from the electric lighting, I began to
appreciate the wonderful clearness of the
night. A man spoke to me as I strolled by. He

was squatting down in the Afghan manner. I
offered him a cigarette, an easy way to com¬
municate when you don't speak the language.
From his linen coat and staff, I took him for a
shepherd. Once he had taken a last puff on the
cigarette, he suddenly started to sing. His
voice rent the silence of the night, rising with
such extraordinary strength and beauty that it
seemed to fill the vaults of the heavens and
echo in their pure, ultramarine heights,
encrusted with thousands of stars.
No song I had ever heard had affected me
so profoundly. The melody carried a message
of salvation and benediction from the whole
nomad race for one little foreigner brought by
chance to those arid lands. It said more than
any book or any speech about the shepherd's
way of life and his cosmic rapport with
nature. I will always treasure that unique
moment of intense communication with those
proud men of the high plateaux.
An inseparable companion
A simple refrain carried on the wind can
express the essence of an entire way of life.
How many masterpieces have flowed from the
flutes of goatherds or camel-drivers to vanish
into thin air? Music born in the dust of the
mountain trails is ephemeral. Yet it is also the
truest music, the closest to life.
If you ask musicians how they composed
their finest pieces, many will tell you that they
got their inspiration while walking. Some fill
their pockets with scraps of paper on which
they scribble phrases and fragments of melody
as they come into their heads. Others, more
up-to-date, never go anywhere without dicta¬
phones, which are even more direct and
convenient than paper for capturing ideas,
moods or just evocative sounds.
Walkers know that, when they stride out
to the rhythm of their breathing, it never takes
long for some tune or other to fall in step with
them in their mind. The swelling of the lungs
easily transforms itself into the skirl of bag¬
pipes leading Scottish highlanders over the
moors to some glorious encounter with des¬
tiny. Or maybe the rhythm of the strides sug¬
gests the bala of a griot giving heart to Bam¬
bara warriors marching out to do battle in the
savannah. For there is no moment of African
life that does not have its own music: even
beyond life, there is a music for death and to
sustain the soul in its extraterrestrial wande¬
ring. Music floats down the river with the
canoe, fertilizes the fields with the cultivators,
bobs on the water with the fishing-boats,
speaks through the forest spirits. Everywhere
men, women and masked dancers caper to its
rhythm.
Can one still talk of it as street music,
when it is the voice of the street itself, even
down to the vocal intonations that shape the
music of the tongue the people speak? Here
music is part and parcel of a whole way of life.
It carries within it memory and knowledge,
reality and myth. It is society's cement, the
inseparable companion of the human race.

bring South Africa closer to all the efforts
and all the plans and all the information
and everything available within UNESCO.
Kissinger: The role of every great leader
is to take his people from where it is to
where it has never been. No two contem¬
porary leaders symbolize this task more
than our two honorées today.
Mayor: History is not predictable pre¬
cisely because people like Nelson Mandela
and President de Klerk exercise their
freedom to challenge the past in order to
construct the future.
De Klerk: We in South Africa are simi¬
larly dedicated to this approach of peaceful
dialogue, discussion and negotiation, and
sincerely trust that we shall succeed in
laying the foundations of a new nation of
which all our citizens may be proud. . . .
The irreversibility of the current initiatives
is no longer in question. The good faith of
the South African Government has been
demonstrated beyond doubt.
I am sharing this platform and this
peace prize with my compatriot, Mr.
Nelson Mandela. We have indeed arrived at
this point along very different routes, but
our presence here together does, in a very
real sense, demonstrate our real desire, and
that of most other South Africans, to over
come our differences and embrace the
future together in a new, just, reconciled
and fully democratic South Africa.
Mandela: It is a hopeful sign of the
potential of my country that this year this
prize is shared by two people who trace
their respective political ideals to opposing
poles on our national political spectrum.
It is the hope of all South Africans that
this joint award signifies the convergence
of our aims and a growing consensus that
has begun to emerge amongst the over¬
whelming majority of South Africans
about the future direction of our country.
South Africa cries out for peace and
for democracy. It is our considered judge¬
ment that we shall not have the one
without the other. What we seek to build
in South Africa is a society centred on
human needs and aspirations.
The oppressed majority in South
Africa have waged a struggle to capture
for themselves the right to determine their
own destiny, including the right to deter¬
mine for themselves what to do with their
future. The indispensable condition for
that is the achievement of democracy. We
consider that a goal that is worthy of the
support of the entire international com¬
munity. This prize to us has meaning 39
because it symbolizes that support. g^

IT is a magnificent city. Its ramparts
face the Caribbean Sea. Within the for¬
tifications, dominated by the imposing
fortress of San Felipe de Barajas, lies a tra¬
cery of narrow lanes dating from colonial
times, lined with white houses bearing
carved wooden balconies, with churches,
palaces and aristocratic dwellings. The
tropical atmosphere is intoxicating, with
its lights, its scents of fruits and spices, its
cumbia and vallenato rhythms, the beauty
of its mestizo women.

which is listed as a World Heritage site,
contains the most beautiful architectural
ensemble of any city of the Americas. A

In 1501 Rodrigo de Bastidas, a lawyer
from Seville, sailed into the Bay of Carta¬
gena with a small band of conquistadors.
The coast was flat and marshy. But the
Spaniards soon noted that the local
people "the Indians", as they called
them were not mere hunters and
fishermen. Their leaders wore golden
jewellery, and their temples were full of
precious stones.
Convinced they were on the threshold
of El Dorado, the longed-for land of gold,
the conquistadors sailed up the Río Mag¬
dalena, penetrating 1,500 kilometres
towards the Andes cordillera. What they
found surpassed all their expectations. In
each village, the richly decorated houses
of the wealthier citizens, the temples and
burial places all indicated the existence of
extraordinary civilizations, Chibcha,
Quimbaya and others. So the Spaniards

decided to build a port on the Caribbean
to serve as a warehouse for the wealth of
the country before it was loaded onto
boats for the journey to-Seville.
The Slave of the Slaves
Pedro de Heredia, a Madrid nobleman, laid
the foundations of the city in 1533. The site
was exceptional: the bay, stretching for
seven kilometres, was separated from the
open sea by the Bocagrande peninsula
now a district of the modem city and by
the islands of Tierra Bomba and Baru.
It did not take long for the wealth
stored in Cartagena to attract the greed of
the pirates who were already prowling the
Caribbean. The Spaniards undertook vast
public works to protect the city. The
keystone of the defences was San Felipe
de Barajas, which was built on the highest
point of the neighbourhood. To prevent
the treasure convoys from the Andes from
the risk of attack on their journey to the
Caribbean, the Spaniards dug a 114-kilo-
metre-long canal, navigable for some
ocean-going vessels, from the Río Magda¬
lena to the Bay of Cartagena. It was the
most ambitious engineering venture of the
Spanish colonial epoch.
All these projects required a cheap and
plentiful labour force. At the beginning of
the seventeenth century Cartagena, along
with Vera Cruz in Mexico, was granted a
monopoly of the Caribbean slave trade.
The city subsequently became the greatest
slave market of the New World.
Exhausted by the months-long sea cros¬
sing, the African captives went virtually
straight from the ships to auction at the
feria de negros, or slave market, whose
vestiges can still be seen in today's Plaza de
los Coches, by the entrance to the old city.
When the Jesuit Pedro Claver learned
of the Africans' sufferings on his arrival in
the town in 1610, he made up his mind to
help them, vowing to become the "slave of
the slaves". Subsequently he gave himself
up body and soul to the cause. He died in
1654, and his remains now lie in the eigh¬
teenth-century church that bears his name.
The slaves brought more than just
their misery with them. They also
imported their culture. The traditions,
songs and dances they introduced from
Africa did not please their masters, so to
avoid punishment they mixed Catholic
ritual with animist or Islamic rhythms.
From 1610 on, the Office of the Holy
Inquisition, operating from a palace whose
magnificent baroque gateway can still be
admired in Bolivar Square, was all-
powerful. The rulers of Catholic Spain
thus linked the cross and the sword, the
better to impose their authority. The
Inquisition's first victim was Luis de
Andrea, the leader of a group of slaves
who practiced their traditional religion in
secret on the Popa hill, outside the fortifi¬
cations. In all, 767 people were condemned
for heresy before Colombia attained inde¬
pendence in the early nineteenth century.
Five of them were burned at the stake.
An impregnable fortress
After the pirates who recognized no law
at all, privateers operating in the name of
the King of France or of England came to
threaten Cartagena. In March 1741
English ships were sighted in the bay. The
fleet was bigger than the Armada sent by
Philip II to threaten England in 1588. Its
commander, Edward Vernon, had under
his orders 12,600 sailors, 8,000 soldiers,
2,000 auxiliaries and 1,000 slaves, as well
as a regiment of 4,000 Americans led by
Captain Lawrence Washington. To
confront this force the Cartagena garrison
could only muster 3,000 soldiers, 600
natives armed with bows and arrows and
six warships. The boats were under the
command of Admiral Blas de Lezo, the
hero of 22 previous naval encounters.
Admiral Vernon succeeded in entering
the bay and on the night of 20 April
attacked the fortress of San Felipe de
Barajas. De Lezo and his men resisted
with a ferocity bom of desperation. After
a month the besiegers were forced to
weigh anchor. Today a statue of the hero
of Cartagena still stands at the foot of the
fortress to recall one of the bloodiest epi¬
sodes in the city's history.
The siege of 1741 persuaded the Spanish
to turn Cartagena de Indias into the prin¬
cipal stronghold of their empire. It took
sixty years' work to make it impregnable.
The fortress itself was completely reno¬
vated, and several powerful gun batteries
among them the celebrated Twelve
Apostles were installed in it. They were
linked to one another by an ingenious net¬
work of ramps, drawbridges, turrets, look¬
outs, cul-de-sacs and underground galleries
planned to doom any attempted siege to fai¬
lure. Immense storehouses were hollowed
out of the rock to hold supplies and muni¬
tions. In addition, the fortress was linked to
the city by a submarine tunnel.
The Spaniards did not stop at that,
however. To prevent hostile ocean-going
vessels from entering the bay, they closed
off the principal access channel by building
a kilometre-long barrier on the sea-bed
between the Bocagrande peninsula and the
island of Tierra Bomba. Over a twenty-
five-year period from 1753 to 1778, hun¬
dreds of slaves carted rocks by the ton to
the seashore to be lowered into place
beneath the waves. The dyke remains in
place to this day.
To put the finishing touches to the
defences, the Spaniards built two new forts
to guard the bay's other entrance, between
the islands of Tierra Bomba and Baru. They
were so designed that the guns of one fort,
San Fernando de Bocachica, were directed
at the masts of enemy boats while those of
the opposite one, San José, aimed at the
water-line. The coastal fortifications were
also strengthened, and numerous store¬
houses known as bóvedas were installed
to hold arms and provisions. Cartagena de
Indias was now ready to take on the
strongest fleets.
Behind the fortifications the city was
growing. Sumptuous homes and gardens
enriched it. The house of the Marquis de
Valdehoyos, granted "the privilege of
importing slaves" by the Spanish crown,
remains the architectural jewel of the
colonial era. It lies in the old city, near the
Palace of the Inquisition, and now houses
the Office of Tourism.

Around squares that are anything but
square, arcaded buildings provide shade

ment, a stone bench under palms, naive
paintings hanging outside a shop, ice¬
cream vendors strolling by, then suddenly
the blare of Caribbean rhythms ripe with
trumpets and brass from inside a record
shop: that is Cartagena de Indias.
Keeping faith with the past
The city has preserved its ramparts and
fortifications as well as most of its build¬
ings. But the sea-winds and the tropical
climate have in some cases started to erode
the stone. To save the most important
monuments, the authorities have for the
past few years undertaken a restoration
programme costing more than $7 million.
But work is frequently halted for lack of
funds. This was the case with the cathedral
clock-tower, whose foundations were laid
at the close of the sixteenth century. Six
hundred thousand dollars are needed to
repair its beautiful, austere façade, and it is
not clear where they will come from.
Work on the Heredia Theatre, built in
1911, has been similarly affected. The
wood frame had to be replaced, and the
monumental staircase, made of Carrara
marble, needed to be taken out and com¬
pletely reconstructed. Operations, which
42 began three years ago, came to a halt again
^m last November.
"There is no general plan for the resto¬
ration of the city," says Alberto Samudio,
forty-six, one of the architects in charge.
For want of funds a handful of monu¬
ments, chosen in consultation with the
City Council and the Ministry of Cultural
Affairs, have been given priority status.
Samudio, who is responsible for the
restoration of the Heredia Theatre, spends
part of his time working on old houses that
have been bought by private buyers. He
has just handed over a seventeenth-century
mansion in the Calle de la Factoría, one of
Cartagena's oldest streets, to its new owner
after two years' work. The floors are of
ebony, increasingly rare in Colombia, as
are some of the beams; the rest are made of
guayacâu, a still more precious wood.
Humberto Benedetti is President of
the Fondo Mixto de Promoción Turística,
the body charged with encouraging pri¬
vate investors and foundations to take an
interest in the restoration of the old
quarter. He states categorically that "Every
house, every building, every fortress that is
to be restored must be assigned a specific
function. It is the only way to stop them
deteriorating again." So the handsome fort
of San Sebastián del Pastelillo has become
the headquarters of the Fishing Club. The
restored Convent of San Diego now
houses the College of Fine Arts. Within
the walls of the Convent of Santa Clara a
250-bed luxury hotel is to be built. The
"Classic de Andrei" restaurant has opened
in an expensively-restored colonial house
boasting sixteenth-century tilework. The
only problem with this policy is that the
lack of systematic supervision by the
authorities allows property developers to
undertake projects that are not properly
thought through, at the risk of defacing
the city.
One reason why it is difficult to res¬
pect the past is because there are few
ancient records for architects to consult.
The director of the city's archives, Moisés
Alvarez, who has twice travelled to Seville
with the aid of a UNESCO grant, has grand
plans. But sadly the only reliable archives
he possesses, apart from a few late-eigh¬
teenth-century protocols, date from the
nineteenth century. "Everything else is in
Seville or Madrid, or was destroyed by the
climate," he says. He has only two dusty
rooms providing 100 square metres of
floorspace in which to store his docu¬
ments. A round table stands in the patio
of the old building next to the Palace of
the Inquisition. It is there that students
UNESCO IN ACTION
WORLD HERITAGE
and historians must sit when they come to
consult the dossiers.
The city's historian, Eduardo Lemaître,
laments the fact that he has never been
able to raise the money to bring out a
second edition of his four-volume history
of Cartagena. The first edition, running to
only 3,000 copies, is now unobtainable.
Nicolas Cury, the mayor of Cartagena,
sits in a vast office in the Town Hall, which
bears on its façade a UNESCO plaque
placed there in 1985. "The situation is
serious," he says. "In spite of general
goodwill and aid from the state, the Bank
of the Republic and foundations, we still
don't have the resources to restore this
magnificent city as it deserves. We're not
asking people to give us money, simply to
provide long-term credit that would let us
do better than we are at the moment."
In Bolivar Square at the heart of the
city, an equestrian statue of the Liberator
rises up among the palms. Bolivar was
given a hero's welcome when he freed the
city from the Spaniards in 1821. In his
speech of thanks he pronounced the
famous words "Si Caracas me dio la vida,
vosotros me desteis gloria" "Caracas
may have given me birth, but you gave me
glory". Now a city of 500,000 people
whose modern Palace of Congresses bears
testimony to its vitality, Cartagena de
Indias is keeping faith not just with Simón
Bolívar: it is all its past that it intends to
preserve.

THE VOICE OF Unesco
Unesco Radio is a broadcasting
organization with a difference. "We
produce programmes on topics
related to Unesco's activities or fields
of interest, which are then sent or
proposed to national and local radio
stations in Member States," explains
Erin Faherty-Mella (USA), who, with
fellow-producer Maha Bulos (Jordan),
has put together a library of hundreds
of feature programmes ranging in
length from fifteen minutes to an hour.
Millions of people around the
world listen each week to the
programmes, which cover an
extraordinary range of subjects, from
Aids education to the music industry
in small countries, and from the
wonders of the brain to the need to
preserve the past.
The service is provided free of
charge to radio stations, and today
lists 176 subscribers who have asked
to receive either tapes of all the
features produced, or programme
scripts from which they make their
selection. In addition, weekly air-time
has been bought from the short-wave
services of Irss (Italian Radio Relay
Service), whose broadcasts cover
eastern and western Europe and can
even be picked up in the United
States and Australia, and from Radio
for Peace International (Rfpi), which is
based in Costa Rica and serves North
America, Latin America and the
Caribbean. Unesco Radio also feeds
shorter news spots to UN Radio,
Vatican Radio, Veritas Asia and the
American university network Scow.
Some programmes are also
produced in French and in Russian by
Luc Legris (Mauritius) and Vladislav
Udachin (Cis). These deal principally
with cultural events, including the
anniversaries of famous artists,
writers and scientists such as Vincent
Van Gogh and Alphonse de Lamartine,
and are available on request.

ANGKOR MUST BE SAVED!
"Angkor belongs to humanity. ... We
must not consign our heritage to
silence," declared Unesco's Director-
General, Mr. Federico Mayor, on 30
November 1991, when he launched
an international appeal for the
protection, preservation, restoration
and presentation of the site of Angkor
in war-ravaged Cambodia. Although
Angkor has remained largely
untouched by war, years of enforced
neglect have allowed vegetation,
climate and above all thieves to wreak
terrible damage on the ruins of the
ancient capital of the Khmer kings.
Unesco has proposed, at the request
of the Cambodian authorities, to co¬
ordinate the safeguarding operation,
which will begin with the preparation
of a master plan detailing the work
involved and establishing an order of
priorities. The plan will be drawn up by
an international consultative
committee to be established by
Unesco and chaired by Cambodia's
Head of State, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
PROTECTING THE MARINE
ENVIRONMENT
An annual International Marine
Environment Award has been created
by the World Underwater Federation
(Cmas, for the French name
Confédération Mondiale des Activités

individual, organization or company
whose work has made a major
contribution to the safeguarding of the
marine environment. The prize, which
will be awarded for the first time at
Unesco Headquarters in Paris in May
1992, amounts to $50,000 and is
intended to help the winner continue
working to protect the seas. The
project has received the patronage of
the following bodies, from which
members of the jury will be drawn:

YOUTH IN ACTION
Last December, as part of its efforts
to encourage youth to take part in
activities that benefit society, Unesco
invited young people from all over the
world to take part in a "Youth in
Action" meeting at its Paris
Headquarters. Participants described
projects they had carried out in their
countries to solve problems
connected with development, human
rights, literacy or the protection of the
cultural heritage or identity. One of the
young people commended is chairman
of a non-governmental organization
which has mobilized support for
disabled young Cambodians; another
belonged to a group of cyclists from
the United Kingdom who rode long
distances for peace and international
understanding.
A NEW HISTORY OF Unesco
In his recent book Historia de la
Unesco (published in Spanish by
Unesco/PUF, Paris 1991), Fernando
Valderrama reviews four decades
1946-1987of the history of an
organization whose vast field of action
covers education, science, culture,
the social sciences and
communication. He retraces the active
role Unesco has played in the far-
reaching changes the world has
experienced since the end of World
War II. This well-documented work is
not only the history of an institution
but that of an entire period which
Unesco has interpreted via its
programmes and resolutions and
influenced by Its action and presence
on the international stage.
FLOWERS OF THE NEW WORLD
A travelling exhibition entitled
"Encountering the Flora of the New
World", presented in March 1992 at
the museum of Maubeuge (France) '
displays engravings by the Spanish
naturalist and painter José Celestino
Mutis (1732-1808). The exhibition
was organized by the French
association "Idem Plus Arts", with the
support of Unesco and the co¬
operation of the permanent
delegations of Spain and Colombia to
Unesco. One of the first pupils of
Linnaeus, Mutis devoted 25 years'
work to the preparation of his
monumental study Flora de Bogota ó
de Nueva Granada. Of considerable
scientific and artistic value, his work

Madrid's Botanical Gardens.
THE CHANGING FAMILY
Changing family structures and roles
were examined at an international
conference held by the International
Council of Women in Brussels from 8
to 10 February 1992. The conference,
entitled Changing Families In a
Changing Society, was organized in
collaboration with Unesco, Unicef, the
United Nations Centre for Social
Development and Humanitarian Affairs
and the European Community. As part
of their conclusions, the participants
noted that 'the family, both nuclear
and extended, is a changing system of
individual human relationships which
is constantly reorganizing itself, rather
than a fixed and determined entity. It
constitutes a network which supports
individuals in their permanent
interactions with society. . . . Society
and policies must remain open to the
diverse forms which the nuclear and
extended families can take." The
United Nations has declared 1994 the
International Year of the Family.
VENICE RESTORED
In 1966, Tuscany and Venezia were
ravaged by exceptionally heavy and
violent flooding. At the request of the
Italian authorities, Unesco
subsequently launched a campaign for
international solidarity to preserve
and restore the cultural treasures of
Florence and Venice. A beautifully
illustrated book, Venice Restored
1966-1986, recently published by the
Italian publishing house Electa,
describes the monuments and works
of art of Venice which were restored
during that period as part of the
campaign. The book, which is the
English version of the Italian Venezia
Restaurata 1966-1986, is available
from the Unesco Liaison Office in
Venice (96,000 Lire) and from the
bookshop at Unesco Headquarters in 43

Launching the Environmental
Revolution by Lester Brown
WITH some 10,000 official delegates
from 150 countries and up to
20,000 concerned citizens and
activists scheduled to participate in a parallel
Global Forum, the Earth Summit being held
this June in Rio de Janeiro will be the largest
United Nations conference ever held. It will
dwarf its predecessor, the UN meeting in
Stockholm twenty years ago that officially
launched the international environmental
movement.
As part of their preparation for the meet¬
ing, governments have produced reports on
the state of the environment in their respec¬
tive countries. Most of these reports focus on
national achievements a reduction in air
pollution here or a successful reforestation
programme there. But overall, global environ¬
mental trends are not reassuring. The health
of the planet has deteriorated dangerously
during the twenty years since Stockholm.
As a result, our world faces potentially
convulsive change. The question is, in what
direction will it take us? Will the change come
from strong worldwide initiatives that reverse
the degradation of the planet and restore hope
for the future, or will it come from continuing
environmental deterioration that leads to eco¬
nomic decline and social instability?
A CHANGE WITHOUT PRECEDENT
Muddling through will not work. Either we
turn things around quickly or the self-rein¬
forcing internal dynamic of the deterioration-
and-decline scenario will take over. The policy
decisions we make in the years immediately
ahead will determine whether our children live
in a world of development or decline.
44
There is no precedent for the change in
prospect. Building an environmentally sus¬
tainable future depends on restructuring the
global economy, major shifts in human
reproductive behaviour, and dramatic
changes in values and life-styles. Doing all
this quickly adds up to a revolution, one
defined by the need to restore and preserve
the Earth's environmental systems. If this
Environmental Revolution succeeds, it will
rank with the Agricultural and Industrial
Revolutions as one of the great economic
and social transformations in human history.
Like the Agricultural Revolution, it will
dramatically alter population trends. While
the former set the stage for enormous
increases in human numbers, this revolution
will succeed only if it stabilizes population
size, re-establishing a balance between
people and the natural systems on which
they depend. In contrast to the Industrial
Revolution, which was based on a shift to
fossil fuels, this new transformation will be
based on a shift away from fossil fuels.
The two earlier revolutions were driven
by technological advances the first by the
discovery of farming and the second by the
invention of the steam engine, which
converted energy into mechanical power.
The Environmental Revolution, while it will
obviously use new technologies, will be
driven primarily by the restructuring of the

global economy so that it does not destroy
its natural support systems.
The pace of the Environmental Revolu¬
tion will be far faster than that of its prede¬
cessors. The Agricultural Revolution began
some 10,000 years ago and the Industrial
Revolution has been under way for two cen¬
turies. But if the Environmental Revolution
is to succeed, it must be compressed into a
few decades.
Progress in the Agricultural Revolution
was measured almost exclusively in the
growth in food output that eventually
enabled farmers to produce a surplus that
could feed city-dwellers. Similarly, industrial
progress was gauged by success in expanding
the output of raw materials and manufac¬
tured goods. The Environmental Revolution
will be judged by whether it can shift the
world economy onto an environmentally
sustainable development path, one that leads
to greater economic security, healthier life¬
styles and a worldwide improvement in the
human condition.
Many still do not see the need for such
an economic and social transformation.
They see the Earth's deteriorating physical
condition as a peripheral matter that can be
dealt with by minor policy adjustments. But
twenty years of effort have failed to stem the
tide of environmental degradation. There is
now too much evidence on too many fronts
to take these issues lightly.
Planetary degradation
Already the planet's degradation is damaging
human health, slowing the growth in world
food production, and reversing economic
progress in dozens of countries. By the age
of ten, thousands of children living in
southern California's Los Angeles basin have

Soviet citizens are being treated for radiation
sickness. The accelerated depletion of the
stratospheric ozone layer in the northern
hemisphere will lead to an estimated addi¬
tional 200,000 skin-cancer fatalities over the
next half century in the United States alone.
Worldwide, millions of lives are at stake.
These examples, and countless others, show
that our health is closely linked to that of the
planet.

air pollution, and hotter summers on crop
yields is slowing growth of the world grain
harvest. Combined with continuing rapid
population growth, this has reversed the
steady rise in grain output per person that
the world had become accustomed to. Bet¬
ween 1950 and 1984, the historical peak year,
world grain production per person climbed
by nearly 40 per cent. Since then, it has fallen
roughly 1 per cent a year, with the drop
concentrated in poor countries. With food
imports in these nations restricted by rising
external debt, there are far more hungry
people today than ever before.
On the economic front, the signs are
equally ominous: soil erosion, deforestation
and overgrazing are adversely affecting pro¬
ductivity in the farming, forestry and live¬
stock sectors, slowing overall economic
growth in agriculturally based economies.
The World Bank reports that after three
decades of broad-based economic gains,
incomes fell during the 1980s in more than
forty developing countries. Collectively,
these nations contain more than 800 million
people almost three times the population
of North America and nearly one-sixth that
of the world. In Nigeria, the most populous
country in the ill-fated group, the incomes of
its 123 million people fell a painful 29 per
cent, exceeding the fall in US incomes during
the depression decade of the 1930s.
Anyone who thinks these environ¬
mental, agricultural and economic trends can
easily be reversed need only look at popula¬
tion projections. Those of us born before the
middle of this century have seen world
population double to five billion. We have
witnessed the environmental effects of

more people are added by 2050, over 90 per
cent of them in the Third World, as now
projected by United Nations demographers?
Lessons from the past
The decline in living conditions that was
once predicted by some ecologists from the
combination of continuing rapid population
growth, spreading environmental degrada¬
tion, and rising external debt has become a
reality for one-sixth of humanity. Moreover,
if a more comprehensive system of national
economic accounting were used one that
incorporated losses of natural capital, such as
topsoil and forests, the destruction of pro¬
ductive grasslands, the extinction of plant
and animal species, or the health costs of air
and water pollution, nuclear radiation, and
increased ultraviolet radiation it might well
show that most of humanity suffered a
decline in living conditions during the 1980s.
Today we study the archaeological sites
of civilizations that were undermined by
environmental deterioration. The wheat-
lands that made North Africa the granary of
the Roman Empire are now largely desert.
The early civilizations of the Tigris-
Euphrates Basin declined as the waterlog¬
ging and salting of irrigation systems slowly
shrank their food supply. And the collapse
of the Mayan civilization that flourished in
the Guatemalan lowlands from the third
century B.C. to the ninth century A.D. may
have been triggered by deforestation and soil
erosion.
Although the Environmental Revolution
has been described here largely in environ¬
mental and economic terms, it is in the most
fundamental sense a social revolution: the
product of changing values, of seeing our¬
selves again as a part of nature rather than
apart from nature, of recognizing our depen¬
dence on the Earth's natural systems and
resources and on the goods and services they
provide. L"J

FOLKLORE
Mari Boine Persen. Gula Gula.
1 CD. Realworld CDR W13.
Mari Boine Persen is a Saami
singer (Saami is the correct name for
the Lapps), born into a fishing family in
Iggaldas, near the North Cape. Her
people have often seen their cultural
Identity under threat, but they are
currently experiencing something of a
renaissance, particularly in the field of
literature. Accompanied here by an
unusual assortment of instruments
including an electric bass clarinet, a
charango and an earthenware pot, she
proclaims the Saamis' right to self-
expression in her impressive native
tongue, putting to good use a striking
voice and a skilful sense of harmony.
The heavily stressed music, played
almost on a single note, sometimes
brings to mind Inuit (Eskimo) songs.
POPULAR MUSIC
Latin Alliance. Latin Alliance.
1 CD. Virgin CDVUS 41 262001.
Following In the footsteps of Kid
Frost and Latin Empire, American
Hispanic groups continue to express
themselves vigorously via rap. Latin
Alliance affirms the unity of the
"Latinos" by bringing together rappers
from Los Angeles and New York, the
two principal centres of Hispanic
culture in the United States. Most of
the tracks are in English, a common
denominator for American Hispanics
who employ very different Spanish
dialects. While Chicanos have
preserved traces of Amerindian speech
patterns, Cubans and Puerto Ricans
use a vocabulary including many
African words and phrases. In spite of
being commercialized in a big way, rap
has kept its street credibility and
remains the principal voice of the
"asphalt jungles", though in its Latin
form as presented here it lacks the
aggressivity and disillusioned
bitterness so often present in the Afro-
American version.
JAZZ
The Harper Brothers. Artistry.
Philip Harper (trumpet), Javon Jackson
(tenor sax.), Kevin Kays (piano), Nedra
Wheeler (bass), Winard Harper (drums).
1 CD. Verve 847 986-2.
There are some changes of
personnel on the new Harper Brothers
recording, with the young pianist Kevin
Kays and bassist Nedra Wheeler
making their first appearance. The
group, in the tradition of the great hard-
bop quintets, has lost none of its
cohesion, and it remains one of the
tightest and most integrated
ensembles now playing. This Is an
Intense, highly polished music. Two
moving compositions, "Beulah" and "A
Mother's Love", were inspired by the
mothers of the musicians.
Wynton Marsalis. Thick in the South.
Marsalis (trumpet), Marcus Roberts
(piano), Joe Henderson (tenor sax.),
Bob Hurst (bass), Jeff Watts or Elvin
Jones (drums).
1 CD. Columbia 468659 2.
Wynton Marsalis, who seems to
spend his life in recording studios
nowadays, here pays tribute, as part of
a monumental series of records
dedicated to the blues, to the southern
United States where he was born. The
inventive orchestrations give the
Impression of a much bigger group,
and guest Joe Henderson adds extra
density to the sound. Marsalis
broadens his tonal palette still further.
Freed from the influence of Miles
Davis, he is developing a sound that is
all his own. His compositional talent is
confirmed by "So This is Jazz, Hugh?",
a remarkable track far from any
recognizable conventions.
Antonio Hart. For the First Time.
Hart (alto sax.), Mulgrew Miller (piano),
Christian McBride (bass), Lewis Nash
(drums), Roy Hargrove (trumpet), Bill
Pierce (tenor sax.), Thomas Williams
(trumpet).
1 CD. BMG PD83120.
Antonio Hart and his partner Roy
Hargrove are two of the most
spectacular jazz talents to have
appeared over the past five years.
Hart's impromptu intervention at a
Branford Marsalis concert in Paris a
few months back astonished the
audience. The pair's approach to jazz
is full-blooded. In addition, Mulgrew
Miller is outstanding on the ballads,
bringing pure poetry to "Embraceable
You", "Bewitched" and "I've Never"
Been in Love Before", and Bill Pierce
and the others are also of high calibre.
This is a group to watch closely.
James Moody. Honey.
Moody (soprano, alto and tenor sax.),
Kenny Barron (piano), Todd Coolman
(bass), Akira Tana (drums, percussion,
marimba).
1 CD. BMG PD83111.
James Moody, affectionately
christened "Moody Fruity" by the
saxophonist Bill Cody, here distils a
smooth, swinging music rich as vintage
Bordeaux wine. There is nothing
particularly new here, just consummate
artistry ceaselessly refined. Moody
interprets such standards as "It Might
as Well Be Spring", "When You Wish
Upon a Star", "Someone to Watch Over
Me" and "I Can't Get Started" with
such lyricism that it is impossible to
tire of them. He even sings on
"Honey's Tune", with results as
pleasing as on the classic "Moody's
Mood". Kenny Barron, who started his
career at the age of sixteen with
Moody, shows a sure touch in
underscoring the saxophonist's playing.
This is top-level Moody.
Isabelle Leymarie
CLASSICAL
Chamber Music
from Theresienstadt,
1941-45.
Hawthorn String Quartet with Virginia
Eskin (piano).
1 CD. Channel Classics CLS 1691.
A number of artists were detained
at the Terezin or Theresienstadt
concentration camp, which was set up
by the Nazis forty kilometres from
Prague during the Second World War.
Among them were the Czech musicians
Gideon Klein (1919-1945), a pupil of
Alois Haba, and Viktor Ullmann (1898-
1944), who had studied under
Schoenberg. There was an
underground musical life at Terezin,
and some composing was done there,
as the great conductor Karel Ancerl has
described. Not much of the work has
survived, but the Terezin Chamber
Music Foundation, which was
responsible for this record, has set out
to make known what little remains. Of
the four pieces by Gideon Klein, the
Sonata for Piano stands out as a
fascinating synthesis of influences
ranging from Schoenberg to Prokofiev
by way of French clarity. Quatuor Opus
2 is overwhelming in its humanity.
Viktor Ullmann's Quatuor No. 3 is very
different, employing a more catholic
musical language; the texture of the
piece has an evanescent quality that
calls Fauré to mind.
Magnus Lindberg. Action-situation-
signification and Kraft.
The Toimix Ensemble and the Swedish
Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted
by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
1 CD. Finlandia FACD 372.
Born in 1958, Magnus Lindberg is
one of Finland's most gifted young
composers, and his work has shown
uncommon energy and density from the
time of his first recorded composition,
de Tartuffe, je crois, performed by the
Endymion Ensemble in 1981 (Finlandia
FACD 361). Action-situation-
signification, an exercise in concrete
music, takes its inspiration from a
book by Elias Canetti as well as from
Pierre Schaeffer. It is Kraft, however,
an orchestral work incorporating human
cries which won an award at the
International Rostrum of Composers of
the International Music Council, that
best shows Lindberg's range. His most
recent piece, Marea (1990), highlights
his preoccupation with harmony in all
Its forms.
Georges Enesco. Violin Sonatas Nos.
2 and 3. Suite No. 1. Dinu Lipatti.
Sonatina. Concertino in Classic Style.
2 CDs. Philips Legendary Classics 426
100-2.
This boxed set is valuable for three
reasons. It contains recordings by the
violinist Georges Enesco and the
pianist Dinu Lipatti, prestigious artists
whose work forms part of the world
heritage; in addition, it features their
own compositions; and It also has
historical interest, as the original
recordings were made in 1943 under
difficult wartime conditions. Enesco's
versatility is immediately apparent; he
even plays piano on the Suite no. 1 in
G minor, Op. 3, and in extracts from
the Suite no. 2 in D major, Op. 10,
works of his youth when he was still
very much under the influence of
J.S.Bach. Arriving in France in 1895, he
quickly got down to work, studying with
Massenet and Fauré and playing with
Cortot and Thibaud. Yet he never forgot
his native Romania. If his Sonata no. 2
in F minor for violin and piano, Op. 6,
shows the French influence, the 3rd
Sonata in A minor for violin and piano,
a very personal work, draws instead on
Romanian folk music. The
understanding shown between the two
players on this piece is remarkable.
Equally admirable is the Suite no. 1 in
C major for orchestra, Op. 9, a work of
unforgettable verve that, while
unmistakably the work of Enesco,
nonetheless shows a Turkish influence.
The works of Dinu Lipatti (1917-
1950), a fellow Romanian who died
young in Switzerland, are less
interesting than Enesco's. Both the
Sonatina for the left hand and the
Concertino in the classic style are neo¬
classical in manner, and have nothing
really new to offer. Yet they are worth
hearing for Lipatti's unique piano style,
one of the purest of the century.

A new look at international law
International Law:
Achievements and Prospects,
published by UNESCO and
Martinus NijhoffPublishers (The
Netherlands) is a practical work
ofreference intended to be
accessible to students throughout
the world. Here its General
Editor, Mohammed Bedjaoui,
outlines the contents of the book
and sets it in its context.
Why publish a new manual of interna¬
tional law at thispoint in time?
First of all, no-one would deny that inter¬
national law has become highly topical.
Every time the world experiences a major
political crisis, international public opinion
makes a discovery and a profession of faith.
On the one hand, it discovers the existence
of international law, which is supposed to
govern and harmonize the relations between
states; on the other, it affirms the belief that
international law is the pure expression of
justice and peace, of liberty and equality
for every people and for all mankind.
Public opinion harbours the conviction,
vague but entrenched, that international law
must be the only refuge of unchallenged,
universal values which every human being,
whatever his or her culture, must recognize
or else risk being taken for a barbarian.
It is always difficult to admit to people
that international law is not just this recep¬
tacle of unchanging values, but also the
expression of a moment in human history, a
reflection of the evolving international order.
International Law: Achievements and
Prospects is unique because it is international,
multicultural and "polyphonic". Its purpose
was to be a forum thrown open as widely as
possible to the juridical worlds of the North,
the South, the East and the West, and a melt¬
ing pot for all the juridical sensibilities of our
time. With the help of authors of diverse ori-
AQ gins, from every continent and from widely
^_ different backgrounds, the work brings into
an interview with Mohammed Bedjaoui
focus "the main forms of civilization" and
"the principal legal systems of the world," to
borrow the terminology of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice.
Who tookpart in theproject?
Almost seventy authors were involved.
Some fifteen judges, serving or retired, of the
International Court of Justice were kind
enough to contribute, among them the cur¬
rent President of the Court, Sir Robert Jen¬
nings, and four of his predecessors.
Obviously, many teachers of international
law more than thirty of them, from both
developing and developed nations were also
involved. Ministers, diplomats and interna¬
tional civil servants also answered my appeal,
enriching the work with their knowledge and
experience.
I am proud to have brought to a conclu¬
sion a work to which authors from every
continent have contributed.
How does the book relate to previous
works ofsynthesis on international law?
It is intended to reflect a field of law and
international relations that is experiencing
exponential growth.
The justification for a work of this scope,
as compared with monographs or shorter
traditional textbooks, is that it provides the
reader, whether student or specialist, a jurist
or simply someone with an interest in inter¬
national affairs, with a comprehensive work
of reference that is both coherent and diverse.
For the time being, the work is appearing
in two editions, in French and in English,
each running to over a thousand pages.
Spanish and Chinese versions are planned,
and others will probably follow. It is an
achievement of which UNESCO can be
proud, since it responds to two imperatives
that are among the Organization's principal
responsibilities, the advancement of know¬
ledge and the creation of educational tools.
What kind of information does the book
contain?
As I have pointed out, one of the book's
aims is to give an account of the current state
of international law by drawing attention to
various representative components of cur¬
rent trends and sensibilities within it.
At the same time the manual is an educa¬
tional tool which is intended to be an intro¬
duction to the subject. Its contents were
drawn up to offer a comprehensive, though
not exhaustive, view of contemporary inter¬
national law. Here let me simply list the
titles of different sections of the work, each
one comprising an introduction and several
chapters: Subjects of International Law;
Sources of International Law; Competence
and Responsibility of States; The Law of
Friendly Relations Between States; Peaceful
Settlement of Disputes; The Law of Interna¬
tional Economic Relations; The Law of
Conflictual Relations; The Law of the Sea;
Air and Extra-Atmospheric Space; Other
Systems (Antarctica, international rivers,
lakes and canals, and the protection of the
environment); International Protection of
Human Rights and Rights of Peoples; and
Community-Oriented Rights, from deve¬
lopment to decolonization and peace.

<![CDATA[
The manual is intended to be a mixture of
law and facts, insofar as that is possible. Its
authors are eminent theorists who are also
practitioners of the subject. Their contribu¬
tions express a syncretic global view of inter¬
national law, which is an attempt to describe
the complex realities of the contemporary
world.
I had no hesitation in encouraging the
authors to cover both lex lata, the law as it is,
but also new norms which are still in the pro¬
cess of being created, which the needs of the
international community have started to out¬
line or model but which have not yet become
obligatory. It is important that trends in inter¬
national law and the stages by which interna¬
tional law evolves and changes should be
understood, notably by young readers.
This manual which expounds the basic
concepts of international law that are rele¬
vant and accepted today also looks towards
the future, without in any way dabbling in
futurology.
Could you outline the state of contempo¬
rary international law, as it is presented in
the book?
The law consists primarily of a collection
of principles and norms, and it has made con¬
siderable progress in the course of the cen¬
tury.
Before the First World War, interna
tional law was above all the law governing
relationships between the European powers.
But this "classical" law was extremely inade¬
quate. Recourse to war was not prohibited.
International law regulated the sharing out
of colonies and the modalities of coloniza¬
tion. Relations between states and their own
nationals were essentially governed by
national jurisdictions, thereby excluding
international protection of human rights.
It is in this century that the fundamental
principles of international law have been
formed and established, insofar as these
principles, while having moral or political
scope, limit sovereignty. If sovereignty is a
principle of international law, which in a
sense it predates, it nevertheless appears in
an essentially negative light when the discre¬
tionary power with which it vests each state
is inevitably destined to be limited by the
norms of international law.
So international law is built in relation to
the limitations it imposes on sovereignty.
That is the case with regard to the law rela¬
ting to the use of armed force, dominated by
Article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations
Charter, which sets forth the principle that
states shall refrain from the threat or use of
force in international relations. It is also true
with regard to the right of self-determination
of peoples, on which the right to decoloniza¬
tion is based; and with regard to human
rights and fundamental freedoms.
International law is also a collection of
techniques, though that is not all that it is.
These techniques have been considerably
developed, diversified and refined in this
century, and particularly in recent years, in
response to the demand created by the
increased density of international relations.
This development results not only from
the diversification of the various processes by
which law is formed (treaties, customs, codi¬
fication). It also stems from the appearance
of new normative categories, including the
imperatives of jus cogens, accepted and reco-
Celebration (1989) by David Hockney. This
English painter was one of many leading
artists from all over the world who were
invited to create a work of art to accompany
the text of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights adopted by the United Nations in
1948. The "images of freedom" the artists
produced have since been exhibited in many
countries and have also been reproduced,
with the text of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, in Mémoire de la liberté, Les
artistes imagent la liberté (Gefrart, Paris
1991, with Arts Multl and Editions Sedeóme),
a book published in a pluringual edition with
UNESCO's participation.
UNESCO IN ACTION
BOOKS
gnized by the international community as
unwaivable, and also soft law, which reflects
the importance which the contents of resolu¬
tions have in international law even when
these resolutions are not obligatory.
Techniques for settling international dif¬
ferences, like normative techniques, have
developed to an enormous extent in the twen¬
tieth century. In this respect, the establishment
of a system of international justice after the
First World War was a decisive stage in the
history of international law. Yet judicial settle¬
ment only caught on gradually in international
relations. Over the past few years, however, a
growing number of disputes have come before
the International Court ofJustice.
One of the most remarkable aspects of
the evolution of international law in recent
years has been the development of tech¬
niques that might be called executive since
they relate to the application of the law.
These techniques, which have proliferated in
a number of fields, are related to treaties or
resolutions. Their object is to exercise
control over states' execution of their obliga¬
tions, or else over their behaviour relating to
the dispositions of resolutions.
Peace-keeping operations have a place
among these executive techniques. They are
generally thought of in terms of bringing
peace to conflictual situations, but their object
is just as much to supervise the application of
Security Council resolutions ordering cease¬
fires or the withdrawal of forces, or else of
agreements by which a conflict has been
settled, as was the case in Namibia.
The increasing number of these opera¬
tions in the different world regions and the
extension of their mission are testimony of
their success.
Finally let me say that common interests,
shared convictions and perceptions of soli¬
darity have progressed in depth, even when
that process has been hidden by political dif¬
ferences and the politics of the closed door.
These shared interests form the basis of
international law and justify it as the law of
the international community, as the leaven
of a new international juridical order.
That is one of the messages that this
manual hopes to convey.

Letters
to the Editor
50
A surprise in Reykjavik
I am an assiduous reader of your
magazine, and particularly enjoyed
the November 1990 issue entitled
"Sacred Places". I should like to
reply to the remarks made by M.
Michel Bourguet in his letter,
headed "The temple of the heart",
which you published in your March
1991 "Letters to the Editor"
column.
Although I am not a believer, I
have visited many religious
edifices, particularly in France. I
do not go to them to commune
with God but to admire and pay
tribute to those who built them. I
feel the same emotion before the
majesty and refinement of the
churches of Brou, Conques,
Vézelay and Autun as I do in the
presence of secular monuments
associated with towns that were
once wealthy or powerful.
Curiosity is sometimes mingled
with admiration when the
magnificence of the building
seems out of proportion with the
village in which it lies. . . .
Michel Bourguet will understand
that since this is my viewpoint I
have no interest in Protestant
places of worship. Nonetheless, I
quite understand that as a
believer he should hold that the
true temple of God is not in some
geographical location but in the
human heart.
Perhaps I could point out to
him, though, that one sometimes
comes across examples of
Protestant architecture which
combine austerity, elegance and
strength. I am thinking of the
Lutheran church in Reykjavik,
which I saw and to my surprise
admired on a recent visit to
Iceland.
Maybe, however, this is the
exception that proves the rule, for
it could hardly be considered an
example of "desacralizing"
objects and places.
Jules Vanhese
La Louvière (Belgium)
A new view of the sea
We thoroughly enjoyed your issue
on the sea ("Sea Fever",
August/September 1991). But we
found no mention in it of the
mythology of the Kogua people of
Colombia, except perhaps by
allusion in the poem by Jorge Luis
Borges.
This Amerindian civilization has
bequeathed to us an extraordinary
hymn that can be read in the Gold
Museum in Bogota:
In the beginning was the Sea.
All was darkness.
There was neither Sun nor
Moon,
No People, Plants nor Animals.
There was only the Sea;
And the Sea was everywhere.
The Sea was the Mother:
Neither person nor thing, nor
anything at all.
She was the spirit of that
which was to come;
and she was thought
and she was memory.
Congratulations on the issue.
Please keep providing us with
beautiful images that open the
gateway to dreams.
Mireille Bandou
and Alain Kermarrec,
Guadeloupe
You will find an article on Kogua
mythology in our May 1990 issue
entitled "In the beginning ..." It
starts with a long quotation from
the poem that you have so kindly
sent us.
In defence of Elgar
In your January 1992 issue ("The
Demographic Dimension"), I was
surprised to find, alongside
articles of high quality, a review of
classical music that expressed an
ideology contrary to the ideals of
the United Nations a serious
matter for a magazine like yours
that is in a sense an emanation of
UNESCO.
The critic talks of "minor
masters" and it turns out to be
Elgar that he is discussing!
Fraternity, humanism and a
respect for culture all seem to me
to be totally opposed to this kind
of peremptory affirmation. As an
admirer of Yehudi Menuhin, I was
also surprised to see his work as
a conductor so lightly passed
over. There should be no
lightweight features in
heavyweight journals.
Frederik Reitz
Paris (France)
Our music feature covers a wide
range, from pop, jazz and folk to
classical. Both our critics are free
to express their opinions and
musical quality is their first criterion
ofjudgement. Their views on
musicians and their works are
inevitably subjective, as are those
of any critic, but they have no
ideological axe to grind. For us, the
value of the column, besides its
wide geopolitical frame of
reference, lies precisely in this
subjectivity, which can be
stimulating for readers whether or
not they agree with the opinions
expressed.
The wisdom of Amadou
Hampâté Bâ
As a freelance precis-writer who
has worked for many years with
UNESCO and other United Nations
organizations, I was glad that
Diélika Diallo, in a moving
tribute to Amadou Hampâté Bâ
(January 1992), recalled the
manner in which he would "defuse
tense situations by telling an
apposite African story in which his
audience could recognize
themselves".
I well remember how, well-
trained in the rigorous and
austere "house style" of United
Nations summary records, I often
discussed at length with my
colleagues whether, and how, we
could incorporate Amadou
Hampâté Bâ's fables, for that is
exactly what they were moral
stories with animals as
characters, most pertinent to the
situation, into the reports.
Sometimes, my view that we
should prevailed, and we did our
best to ensure that an echo
remained.
I am happy that we did, because
now I realize, more than ever
before, that his stories were the
record.
Amadou Hampâté Bâ left
UNESCO's Executive Board a long
time ago; but I am perhaps not
alone in still sensing an
emptiness in the meeting-room.

Rediscovering
1492 and afterwards:
N°l. 1992
This issue of Unesco's international quarterly review of
information and reflection on museums focuses on
migrations to Latin America and the museums that reflect
cultural diversity there: Afro-Cuban traditions, Japanese
immigrants in Peru, the Jewish population of Buenos Aires,
the Germans in southern Brazil, a "Viking" in Ecuador.
Movements outward from Latin America are also explored:
Nicaraguan paintings in Denmark, Chilean art in Stockholm
and pre-Columbian inspiration in the works of Joan Miró.
Copies of the "1492" number of Museum in English may
be obtained at the price of US$10 from Blackwell
Publishers, 108 Cowley Road, Oxford 0X4 1JF, UK, or 3
Cambridge Centre, Cambridge MA, 02412, USA. Copies in
Arabic, French, Russian or Spanish may be obtained for 54
French francs (or equivalent in convertible currency) from
Museum, CLT/CH, Unesco, 1 rue Miollis, 75015 Paris,
