Rice-spoon fit
for a queen
This hardwood "statuette"
(56 cm high) is actually
a rice-spoon, a striking
example of a simple
household utensil
transformed into a
graceful work of art by
the hand of a craftsman.
Painted black, the spoon
evokes the shape of a
human body without trunk
or arms, the head being
joined to the legs by a
long and slender neck.
Among the Dan people
of the Ivory Coast, this
type of spoon is the
distinctive emblem of
the mother or the wife
of a chief.

Thanks to communication satellites,
information and television programmes
can now be beamed over the whole
planet. As yet, however, only those
countries whose technology is most
highly developed possess such means
of communication. The result is a
further aggravation of the serious
imbalance which already existed in the
international flow of information.

In whose hands are the media in the modern world?
What are the sources of the information they
transmit? In what directions does this information
flow? Are the "producers" of information also its
"consumers"? Do not the scale, the power and the
sophisticated technology of the modern media mean
that mass communication is a privilege that only the
rich countries can enjoy? Does this in turn imply a
new form of domination, more subtle than its
predecessors, but terribly effective, nonetheless?
If the flow of information is "one way only", what
chances do the poor countries have of exercising a
"right of reply"? What hopes are there of restoring
the balance of communication and information on a
world-wide scale?
Overtly or implicitly, these vitally important questions
were at the centre of many of the debates which
took place during the 19th session of Unesco's
General Conference at Nairobi in October-November
1976. Thanks to the press, the echoes were heard
around the world, and it is probable that in the
coming years the problems of world communication
will continue to preoccupy the international
community and influence the dialogue between
North and South.
This issue of the Unesco Courier is thus concerned
with a subject which during the past few months has
become more topical than ever. It presents a
dossier which is far from complete but whose
contents will, we hope, throw some light on the
problem and help our readers to appreciate not
only its size and complexity, but also the diversity
of the points of view involved.
On the following pages we present:
Unesco's precise role and activities in the field of
information (pages 4 to 17);
the steps taken by the non-aligned countries to
further a truly international exchange of information
(pages 18 to 20);
the demands of the Third World countries, which
consider that the idea of "freedom of information"
cannot be divorced from that of a "balanced flow
of information" (pages 21 to 23);
In addition, we publish two articles of a
"documentary" nature, setting outunder the
responsibility of their authors alonetwo broadly
different notions of the role of information, as
conceived by specialists from the U.S.S.R. (page 24)
and the U.S.A. (page 28).
World newsprint consumption in 1974 totalled
23.2 million metric tons. But of this only
2.8 million tons went to the developing countries,
representing 1 kg per head of population,
compared with an average 18 kg per head in
the industrially developed countries. Here,

" f^ OMMUNICATION is news
today. I am glad that
^^ Unesco should be the
forum for a far-reaching debate which
is in full accordance with its mission."
With these words, spoken in Novem¬
ber 1976 during Unesco's General
Conference at Nairobi, the Organiza¬
tion's Director-General, Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow, drew attention to a
major problem of the modern world.
What is at stake in this debate?
And why should it be held within
Unesco?
The first and most obvious point to
be made is that information today
means powertechnological power
and political powerboth within
countries and at the international
level.
But this power is unevenly distri¬
buted. Decisions governing its use
are, undeniably, increasingly taken
in those countries which possess
highly developed facilities for the
production, storage and transmission
of information. Generally speaking,
the world of information and commu¬
nication is dominated by the Western
media (press, radio, TV, films, pub¬
lishing, etc.).
One example speaks volumes. On
25 November 1975, Surinam (for-,
merly Dutch Guiana) became inde- f

, pendent. Between 24 and 27 No¬
vember this event occupied only
3 per cent of the space devoted to
foreign news by 16 leading daily
newspapers in 13 Latin American
countries. This 3 per cent came in
its entirety from international news
agencies of the industrialized coun¬
tries. And yet Surinam, a country
somewhat larger than England, is the
world's third biggest producer of
bauxite.
During the same four days, 70 per
cent of the foreign news published
by these newspapers concerned the
industrialized countries, and four-
fifths of this news originated in the
same news agencies.
Such an example helps to explain
why the developing countries find it
hard to accept a situation in which
they are mere "consumers" of a
"product" (information) over whose
manufacture and distribution they
have no control: a product which is,
moreover, as important culturally as
economically, if not more so. Could
it be that the world is divided into
those who can make their voices
heard because they have the means
to do so, and those who cannot?
This, perhaps, is the heart of the
matter.
"The dissemination of information
is largely a one-way process,"
Mr. M'Bow has also pointed out.
Unesco and
news agency development
F OR several years, a great number of Unesco's Member Statesmost
of them developing countrieshave been appealing to Unesco for assis¬
tance in their efforts to correct the imbalance in the flow of information
between North and South, through the promotion of news agencies,
which are an essential link in the chain of communication.
Studies in this connexion were initiated as early as the 1950s. Unesco
began by proposing a number of amendments to the telegraph regulations
applying to the press: further rate reductions for the transmission of
ordinary press telegrams, reduced rates for press messages exceeding
100 words in length and extended facilities and lower charges for press
messages sent by radiocommunication to any destination.
More recently, Unesco joined the International Press Telecommunica¬
tions Council in defending before an ITU (International Telecommunica¬
tion Union) commission the continued availability of the special "press
cable" rate.
Asia and the Far East. A first meeting concerning the development of
the mass media was held in Bangkok (Thailand) in January 1960. Ata
second meeting in December 1961, which dealt specifically with the
development of news agencies in Asia, participants from 14 countries
recommended the establishment of a regional news agency.
The Organization of Asian News Agencies (OANA) was established in
1963 and has since been actively promoting collaboration and news
exchange between its members.
Latin America. The first regional meeting on news agencies was held in
Santiago (Chile) in 1 961 . But the situation in this region was vastly diffe¬
rent from that in Asia, and 15 years later the number of national agencies
in Latin America remained limited, despite the fact that a second meeting
had been held in Quito (Ecuador) in 1971.
In July 1976, the first Intergovernmental Conference on Communica¬
tion Policies in Latin America and the Caribbean, meeting in San José
(Costa Rica), recommended "the establishment of a Latin American and
Caribbean news agency, or a consortium of agencies, in the region".
But the participating States also stipulated that its establishment should
"in no way impair the free operation of existing agencies or their future
development".
Africa. At the first conference on news agencies, in 1963, specialists
from 29 countries recommended the creation of a Union of African News
Agencies. Recently, this idea has been revived in a study conducted by
the Union of African States.
Furthermore, at a conference of Arab and African news agencies in
Tunis in 1975, Unesco was requested to make a detailed study of national
and regional facilities for news transmission throughout the African and
Arab States, with due reference to existing and planned news agency and
telecommunication facilities.
Lastly, and in addition to regional assistance, Unesco has provided a
number of individual countries (Somalia, Libya, Cameroon, Nepal, Malay¬
sia,. Upper Volta and Thailand) with technical aid in the preparation and
development of national agencies.
"issuing from a few centres mainly
located in the industrialized countries.
Such information perforce reflects
the concerns, aspirations and even
the point of view of the societies in
which it originates and on whose
media it depends, and their mass
communication organizations tend,
whether they will or no, to exercise a
de facto domination which may im¬
pose cultural models."
This imbalance in the use of the
mass media constitutes a global
challenge which has prompted Unesco
to take action in view of its obligation,
as set out in its Constitution, to
"collaborate in the work of advan¬
cing the mutual knowledge and under¬
standing of peoples, through all
means of mass communication and to
that end recommend such interna¬
tional agreements as may be neces¬
sary to promote the free flow of ideas
by word and image."
Unesco has indeed taken such
action since its early days. In the
1950s it embarked on a series of stu¬
dies on world-wide facilities for mass
communication, issuing the findings
in its publication World Communica¬
tions, the latest edition of which
appeared in 1975.
In 1957, a report to the United
Nations General Assembly called
attention to an "information famine",
showing that two-thirds of the world
population lacked even minimum
access to information. This provok¬
ed more decisive action.
. Unesco embarked on 1 5 years of
intensive, mainly technical assistance
to the development of mass media.
Its achievements in these years
included:
the establishment of an Asian
Institute for Broadcasting Develop¬
ment in Malaysia in co-operation
with the Asian Broadcasting Union;
assistance in the development of
national and regional news agen¬
cies (BERNAMA in Malaysia, CANA
in the Caribbean [see article
page 10]);
the establishment of a national
centre for documentary film pro¬
duction in Latin America (Costa
Rica);
the promotion of radio as an ins¬
trument of rural development (India,
Ghana, Senegal);
the development of newspapers-
daily and rural press(Togo, Mali,
Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, Tobago);
assistance in the establishment of
institutes for communication train¬
ing and research (Senegal, Ecuador,
Nigeria, Kenya, India, Malaysia, the
Philippines, the Caribbean);
the development of methods for
training, planning and management
of media institutions and systems;
the adoption of a series of interna¬
tional agreements (on the circula¬
tion of visual and auditory materials
and on the importation of educa-

tional, scientific and cultural mate¬
rial, etc.) and a Declaration of
guiding principles on the use of
satellite broadcasting.
But since its creation 30 years ago,
Unesco has grown. Its representa¬
tive character (and today it has 141
Member States) has been enriched
by the membership of many newly
independent Third World countries.
This growth has posed a new pro¬
blem, that of progressively elimina¬
ting the gulf between the industriali¬
zed world and the developing coun¬
tries.
Unesco is engaged in reflection on
the establishment of the "new world
order" which has been on the agenda
of the United Nations since 1974.
To a great extent, this new order
will depend on improved access to
information, on more effective com¬
munication, on a more equitable
distribution of the mass media with
their immense potential for promo¬
ting mutual understanding between
men and nations, and ultimately on
ensuring that information becomes
once again a liberating force rather
than an instrument of subjection.
The present imbalance is not
merely economic. It also has grave
cultural implications, erasing national
values and replacing them by a silent.
invisible, yet deep-rooted state of
dependence. The very principle of
cultural identity is called in question
when the "transmitter" of information
enjoys technological superiority over
its "receiver."
Since the early 1 970s, the emer¬
gence of the Third World and the
urgency of the problems to be solved
have led to an awareness of the need
to claim and defend this identity and
to use it in support of a fresh, global
approach to the whole question of
development. This is why cultural
policies as well as communication
policies (and, indeed, the two are
inseparable) should be incorporated i
in all development efforts. I
According to Unesco's
Statistical Yearbook, the
latest edition of which
has just been published,
there was a world total
of 922 million radio
receivers in 1974.
But the distribution of
these radios was highly
uneven: in the industrially
developed countries
there were 700 receivers
for every 1,000 of the
population, compared
with only 205 per 1,000
in Latin America, 132 in
the Arab States, 93 in
Asia (excluding China)
and as few as 72 in
Africa. Right, community

Right, "reading-room" in a village in
Colombia. In 1974, this Latin
American country had 36 daily
newspapers, with a total circulation
of about a million and a half copies
per day. These figures are very low for
a country with 24 million inhabitants
where, in the same year, less than
20 per cent of those over the age
of 15 were illiterate. Below, right,
a classroom scene in Pekin (People's
Republic of China), where reading
from newspapers is part of the
educational process.
At the present time, more and more
Member States, aware that Unesco
has accumulated a wealth of expe¬
rience throughout the world, are
seeking its help in clarifying their
communication and information pro¬
blems and in formulating appropriate
policies. Unesco only intervenes at
the specific request of its Member
States and in accordance with the
instructions of its sovereign body,
the General Conference. It has no
communication policy of its own to
suggest to its Member States.
The first conference at which repre¬
sentatives of governments from a
single region met to consider the
question of communication policies
was held at San José, Costa Rica,
in July 1976. Bringing together
delegates from Latin American and
Caribbean countries, it was a land¬
mark in the quest for a mutual enrich¬
ment of cultures and a genuine rap¬
prochement between peoples.
The protection of journalists
At a press conference in Nairobi (Kenya) in November
1976, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, Unesco's Director-
General, made this appeal on behalf of journalists:
"The right to communicate poses in its widest sense
the problem of the responsibility of journalists both as
individuals engaged in a professional activity and as
groups wielding considerable power. In this connexion,
Unesco is contributing to the creation of a universally
applicable code of ethics and duties... But what I wish
to stress here is the need to ensure the effective protec¬
tion of journalists themselves from the arbitrary exercise
of power as they endeavour to fulfil their mission in a
spirit of the strictest objectivity. For it must be admitted
that respect for ethical standards can place journalists in
dangerous situations if they do not enjoy the guarantee
of adequate protection from pressures and reprisals..."

Rural newspapers in Africa
In Africa, where rural communities constitute 80 per cent of the total population
and speak some 800 languages, the use of the press as a medium of mass
communication presents many problems. And yet it is in the rural areas, where
the need to promote development is most urgent, that information can play a
highly important role. Rural newspapers using local languages began to appear
in 1964, notably in Niger, providing not only excellent follow-up material for
literacy programmes but also a highly effective means of communication. Rural
newspaper readers in Africa write to their paper at a rate of one letter for every
five copies sold. In spite of enormous difficulties, the rural press has developed
in many parts of Africa where, since 1972, Unesco has helped to create more than
a dozen papers and supported many other projects, some of them launched by the
countries concerned, others the fruit of various forms of bilateral co-operation.
Most rural newspapers are written in local languages, thus promoting real co¬
operation with isolated populations. As President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania once
remarked: "While other nations try to reach the moon, we are trying to reach the
village." Above, front pages of some African rural papers: 1) Kibaru (the News)
in Bambara (Mali); 2) Game Su (It is time), in Ewe (Togo); 3) Kpodoga (Listen)
in Ewe (Ghana); 4) Linga (Drum), in Sango (Central African Empire); 5) Misénu
Miségbe (Listen and learn) in Fon (Benin); 6) Kisomo (Education) in Kikuyu
(Kenya); 7) Elimu Haina Mwisho (Education has no end) in Kiswahili (Tanzania).
Well before the Conference began,
certain people feared that Unesco
wished to restrict freedom ofexpression
and was, for example, advocating
nationalization of the media, govern¬
ment control of information, or mea¬
sures to prevent the media from
publishing news displeasing to the
authorities.
What had Unesco really done? In
the first place, it had prepared the
working documents, which set out
the problem in an objective manner.
Then, it raised the essential questions,
promoted the exchange of experience
and stimulated reflection on the situa¬
tion, and on the considerations and
mechanisms involved in the formula¬
tion of communication policies.
After extremely fruitful discussions,
the participants drafted and adopted
the "Declaration of San José", a
balanced and carefully-worded text
which demonstrates the absurdity of
the charges levelled against Unesco.
While the Conference did in fact
recommend "the establishment of a
Latin American and Caribbean news
agency, or a consortium of agencies,
in the region", it also took care to
stipulate that this should "in no way
impair the free operation of existing
agencies or-their future development."
In fact, Unesco is very well aware
that it is up to each nation to define
its own policies in the light of its
own options and requirements with
due regard for national realities, for
the freedom of expression and respect
for individuals and communities.
"Where information is concerned,"
Unesco's Director-General told the
San José conference, "multiple and
varied sources constitute the only
guarantee that communication will be
founded on the democratic principle
that all peoples and all nations are
equal in dignity." And, he pointed
but, within each society "the demo¬
cratization of communicationdemo-
]]>

} cracy itselfassumes the participa¬
tion of the largest possible number
in the process of communication."
More recently, however, at
Unesco's General Conference, a draft
declaration on the fundamental prin¬
ciples governing the use of the mass
media revealed wide divergencies of
opinion derived from different concep¬
tions of the role of the mass media.
But on this occasion, with the aim
of reaching the widest possible
consensus, the Conference decided
to send the whole project back to the
drawing board before re-examining it
again in 1978.
In the meantime, the Director
General has been invited "to pay
very special attention to the activities
of the bodies responsible for co-ordi¬
nating and implementing the infor¬
mation programme of the non-aligned
countries".
This programme, based on recom¬
mendations adopted by the non-
aligned countries in Tunis, New Delhi
and Colombo during 1976, is concer¬
ned mainly with improving national
and international news-gathering
networks, strengthening news agency
pools and"since respect for ethical
standards is not without its risks"
giving support to journalists' unions.
The question of information has
now assumed an importance which
is unlikely to diminish in the fore¬
seeable future. This is not only
because, in accordance with instruc¬
tions from its Member States, Unesco
will be holding a series of meetings
similar to the Costa Rica Conference
in each region of the world, together
with many meetings between profes¬
sionals, but above all because the
countries "on the receiving end" of
information are increasingly emphatic
in demanding a fair right to reply.
For its part, Unesco intends no
longer to confine itself to speaking
generally about "freedom of expres¬
sion" and "freedom of informa¬
tion", but also to talk in terms of
"access to and participation in com¬
munication" and a "balanced flow of
information."
What it is endeavouring to define
is a new concept of the right to com¬
municate. Without powers of its*
own, whether economic or of any
other kind, Unesco must rely on its
powers of persuasion and on its
capacity to promote ideas.

by the
English-speaking
Caribbean countries
by Hugh N. J. Cholmondeley
THE English-speaking countries
and territories of the Carib¬
bean stretch through an arc
of the Caribbean Sea measuring more
than 6,000 kilometres from Belize in
the north to Guyana in the south.
Their common cultural background
and economic vulnerability have
long argued in favour of regional
integration.
The need for communication sys¬
tems and institutions to foster this
integration first found official recog¬
nition in a resolution of the annual
meeting of the Heads of Government
HUGH N. J. CHOLMONDELEY of Guyana

Caribbean regional communication project

of these countries in 1967. This
resolution asked Unesco to advise on
the "establishment of a regional news
agency and the regular exchange of
sound radio and television pro¬
grammes".
It was understood by the Heads of
Government meeting and implicit in
their request that the Governments
themselves would have to assume
responsibility for both these initiatives
and that should a news agency prove
feasible, it would therefore be owned
and operated by the Governments
concerned.
Press, radio and television organi¬
zations in the Caribbean are partly in
State ownership and partly in private
hands. In the latter case, the media
belong either to nationals of the
region or to foreign companies.

English-speaking countries of the Caribbean are now participating in the Caribbean
News Agency (CANA), created with the support of Unesco in 1975. CANA has
substantially increased the news flow in and from the region, and its list of foreign
subscribers is steadily growing. Above, left, a teleprinter keyboard. Right, a street

were a major component of any viable
regional communication system, they
would not accept a news agency ser¬
vice controlled by Governments.
A stalemate ensued, but the inter¬
national news agency already estab¬
lished in the Caribbean recognized
the importance of the integration
issue and began to offer a modest
Caribbean service in addition to its
regular international service.
The Heads of Government conti¬
nued to show interest in this matter,
and in 1971 the United Nations Deve¬
lopment Programme (UNDP) agreed
to finance the execution by Unesco
of a regional communication project
in the Caribbean. The project in¬
cluded further study of the feasibility
of a regional news agency.
Working closely with the Common¬
wealth Regional Secretariat for the
Caribbean, the Caribbean Free Trade
Association (CARIFTA), and the
Caribbean Publishers and Broadcasters
Association (CPBA), the project team
was able to present a formula which
would develop a Caribbean News
Agency to be co-operatively owned
by the media, both private and
government-operated.
In July 1975, CANA (Caribbean
News Agency) came into being, work¬
ing on an interim basis with the
established international agency.
On 7 January 1976, CANA became
an independent news service owned
by 17 media institutions and govern¬
ed by an elected board of directors
drawn from both private and govern¬
ment-owned media.
In the course of its first year of
operation, CANA has not only estab¬
lished itself as a reliable and highly
professional agency, but has also
more than doubled its output of
regional Caribbean % news (from
12,000 to more than 24,000 words
per day). It also distributes the
international service of the former
agency.
Of the thirteen English-speaking
Caribbean countries (Antigua, Baha¬
mas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica,
Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Mont¬
serrat, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, St. Lu¬
cia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and
Tobago), eleven are now linked by
CANA duplex teleprinter circuits.
Local correspondents everywhere
are ready to report on prices and
market conditions, and such a service
could soon become a major tool of
regional policy and planning.
Special business and commodity
services designed to provide daily
up-to-the minute information on price
fluctuations and on the availability of
commodities produced outside the
region, together with reports on ship¬
ping opportunities and other types
of information could also find clients
whose interests are of key importance
to the development of the region.
At the same time, the list of
foreign subscribers to CANA's General
News Service continues to grow.
Cuba, Surinam, the British Virgin
Islands, Martinique, the U.S.A., the
People's Republic of China and the
U.S.S.R. are already receiving this
service or are preparing to subscribe
to it.
We can thus say that CANA has
made a good start. The controversial
and protracted negotiations over a
four-year period which brought the
Agency into existence typify the
difficulties which the Regional Inte¬
gration Movement as a whole fre¬
quently faces in reconciling the
different points of view of member
countries. This leaves no room for
complacency, but recent develop¬
ments indicate that national Govern¬
ments in the Caribbean more fully
appreciate the vital role which com¬
munication can play in making good
past shortcomings, and as an agent
for change.

CROSS-CULTURAL
COMMUNICATION:
POSSIBILITY
OR PIPE-DREAM?
EVER since the mythical tower
of Babel, communication bet¬
ween peoples of different lan¬
guages and cultures has been seen
as an eminently desirable ideal but
very difficult to achieve.
Barriers to the universal flow of
thought and ideas have always
existed. Today, voices and ¡mages
can be transmitted over great dis¬
tances and vast areas of the world's
surface. But is this communication
if there is no comprehension ?
Modern communication media
recognize no frontiers. New techno¬
logies have extended the possibilities
of distributing radio and television
programmes on a world-wide basis,
broadcasting information, education,
culture and entertainment to numbers
of sovereign States and peoples of
different cultures and languages.
Many years ago it was pointed -
out that the transnational develop¬
ment of information flow would raise
problems of programme content and
format as well as legal and political
questions.
In 1969 Unesco began to support
a multidisciplinary research pro¬
gramme on the international flow of
communication. This involved long-
term studies of the traffic in tele¬
vision programmes; the content and
effects of short-wave broadcasting
between nations; the structure of
international news agencies; and the
potentialities of satellite-based sys¬
tems for communication between
people and between nations.
JOHN A. WILLINGS, theatre, film and
television designer and director, is currently
in charge of Unesco's programme related
to communication policies. Before joining
Unesco's Headquarters Staff in 1970, he
carried out a number of missions for Unesco
in developing countries of Africa and Asia,
where he helped to design broadcasting
systems and to establish communication
research and training institutions.
This accent on research into cross-
cultural communication was promp¬
ted by the imminent possibility of
direct broadcasting by communica¬
tion satellite to community radio and
television receivers, and eventually
to home receivers.
At the same time concern was
expressed regarding the need for
international agreements in this field.
The Declaration of guiding principles
on the use of satellite broadcasting
was adopted by the General Confe¬
rence of Unesco in 1972.
In the early 1970s, one specialist,
referring to the role of satellite com¬
munication in socio-cultural develop¬
ment, observed: "they tell us that
these problems are all technical, not
political. But this is not socom¬
pounding this situation is the tremen¬
dous inequality between the 'haves'
and the 'have nots' in the domain of
communication."
During the Development Decade
launched in 1960 by the United
Nations, much importance had been
attached to the potential of the new
media for disseminating intercultural
understanding. - At that time, the
expanding commercial broadcasters
seemed to have had great confidence
in this potential.
However, subsequent research has
shown that if, within nations and
within local cultures, the nature,
the process and the effects of com¬
munication are not yet fully under¬
stood, then this is even more true
in the complex field of international
cross-cultural communication. So,
in 1974, Unesco asked a team of
research workers to list and analyze
existing studies of cross-cultural
broadcasting (1).
(1 ) Cross-Cultural Broadcasting by Eduardo
Contreras, James Larson, John K. Mayo
and Peter Spain, Institute for Communi¬
cation Research, Stanford University, U.S.A.
Unesco Reports and Papers on Mass Commu¬
nication No. 77 (1976).
Their first discovery was the
extreme paucity of relevant material.
Secondly, they noted a number of
barriers to cross-cultural communica¬
tion:
cultural differences;
psychological blocks to under¬
standing;
lack of a common language;
lack of the necessary infrastructure
for the production, distribution and
reception of messages and for a multi-
way flow of information;
political and economic considera¬
tions applying to all attempts to
achieve a "free and balanced flow"
of information, both within and
between nations.
It is fairly obvious that in inter¬
national communication, language
is a key factor, determining the
impact of messages and their com¬
prehension. For example, in short¬
wave broadcasting between nations,
reception and understanding are still
largely limited by the ability of listen¬
ers to understand the languages
employed.
Most multi-lingual Third World
countries face two major problems
when dealing with a language policy
for communication. The first con¬
cerns the propagation of a national
language within the country. The
second concerns the languages to
be used in wider, international
communication.
The choice of languages for com¬
munication, especially in broad¬
casting, almost always poses an addi¬
tional political problem.
In Africa, for example, governments
face a dilemma. Are they to allow
broadcast languages to proliferate
for the sake of preserving traditional
cultures, winning the loyalty of mino¬
rity groups and reaching a maximum k
audience? Or are they to standardize f

Audio-visual techniques offer a wide range of possibilities for transmitting information as well as
educational and cultural programmes. Satellite broadcasting can aid international communication,
although many problems in this field are still unsolved. It is not easy to reconcile two fundamental
principles of communication between peoples: the free flow of information, and the sovereign rights
of States concerning the flow of information across their frontiers. Unesco is thus launching a
far-reaching programme of research into the concept of "a free and balanced flow of information".

that once a language has established
itself as predominant in the world it
will eventually fall from that perch. " (2)
How will international communi¬
cation, taking account of linguistic
diversity, be accommodated in the
future ?
While linguistic differences bet¬
ween peoples and between nations
have long been recognized as a major
barrier to communication, it was
suggested two decades ago that
visual means might provide the
breakthrough in cross-cultural under¬
standing. But how far do different
people see and perceive things in
the same way? Is there something
culturally distinct about the way
people interpret a visual ¡mage?
Many stories illustrate the diffi¬
culties of achieving visual communi¬
cation through the media. For
example, there are the early tales
of missiles being thrown at cinema
screens because people were insulted
by the ¡mage of Donald Duck engaged
in human actions and speech.
There are innumerable apocryphal
stories of the rejection by audiences
of blown-up ¡mages of mosquitos
and lice because in close-up they
appeared bigger than the local cows.
In many developing societies, real
difficulties of interpreting still pictures
have been experienced where linear
perspective was employed as a way
of showing shape and distance: these
pictures have often proved to be
incomprehensible to rural people
unfamiliar with urban geometry.

}a single broadcast language for the
sake of emphasizing nationhood,
albeit at the risk of hastening the
disappearance of local cultures,
alienating minority groups, and failing
to communicate with the very people
in whom they most need to inculcate
an understanding of their intentions?
Perhaps there are four related expla¬
nations why, until now, people wishing
to communicate through international
communication media have been
unable to pierce the language barrier.
To take broadcasting as an example,
there is firstly the fact that too many
languages are used; secondly, each
additional language broadcast in¬
volves increased costs; thirdly, it is
difficult to find personnel to produce
programmes in some languages even
if funds are available to do so; finally,
there is a lack of sufficient wave¬
length space to provide a minimum
of programmes in each desired lan¬
guage in order to attract and hold an
audience. Thus, the linguistic pro¬
blem is also related to economic,
manpower, and technical questions.
On the other side of the coin, we
see that one of the most important
influences of cross-cultural communi¬
cation has been to encourage the
adoption of dominant languages as
linguae-francae. Today, English is
the principal language of communica¬
tion in international broadcasting,
not necessarily because of the num¬
ber of speakers, but because, in the
past, the United Kingdom, the United
States and Australia dominated inter¬
national communication by radio.
Nevertheless, if English remains the
principal language of international
communication, it is only the latest
of a series of languages to hold that
position. French, Spanish, Latin,
Greek, Arabic and Chinese have all
enjoyed a comparable position during
the past.
As one specialist has pointed out:
"if anything is clear from the history
of international communication, it is

All over the world, people who see
films for the first time rarely under¬
stand the "grammar" of film pro¬
duction. For example, the "cut", the
"fade", the "dissolve", which are the
punctuation of films, only have
meaning to those who have acquired
that grammar. At the same time
it has been discovered that this
specialized "media literacy" can be
taught very quickly.
Questions pertaining to the effects
of cross-cultural communication are
much more pronounced in the poli¬
tical arena since it is here that many
international relations based upon
communication are defined.
In recent years, the temper of the
debate has intensified as the possi¬
bilities for direct broadcasting across
frontiers have come nearer to reality.
At its heart is the realization that
communication is power: that control
over the mechanisms and content of
a nation's communication system
could enable various vested interests
to control important aspects of a
society's decision-making process as
well as the cultural and political
values which bind it together.
There exists at the present time a
conflict between two essential prin¬
ciples: the sovereign rights of States
in matters pertaining to communica¬
tion across national frontiers; and
the free flow of information. Most
countries pay homage to both, but
"many are now beginning to recognize
the difficulty of reconciling them
within a coherent communication
policy.
It has been observed that the inter¬
national media systems at present
reflect disproportionately the values
and the priorities of certain societies,
with the dominant countries acting
as the "gate-keepers" for communi¬
cation in and between the poorer
developing nations.
Such a state of affairs, the critics
argue, will in the future only enhance
the monopoly power of the present
programme exporters and will pro¬
bably erode even further the freedom
of the importing countries to develop
self-reliant systems capable of
expressing their own cultural values.
Over the years, many pennants
have been flown championing the
causes of "universal cultural exchange"
and "the rights of cultures to resist
dilution by alien values". Achieving
the best balance between these two
extreme positions is one of the most
thorny problems discussed in recent
international conferences on both cul¬
tural and communication policies. .

^rence of Unesco, the sense of inter¬
national responsibility for the estab¬
lishment of . true communication
systems based upon equal partner¬
ship was seen to be as important to
the developed as to the developing
countries.
It was also recognized that such a
co-operative approach to the deve¬
lopment of cross-cultural communica¬
tion systems for the future could no
longer be based on paternalistic or
"neo-colonial" approaches to the
problem. It had to be a process of
active give-and-take in collaboration,
involving the quest for that "unity"
which can only be achieved by rec¬
ognizing and respecting cultural
differences.
Thus after the Nairobi Conference,
Unesco will, during the next two
years, begin a further research pro¬
gramme on cross-cultural commu¬
nication involving studies:
on what people of various cultures
understand by the concept of "free
and balanced flow of information";
on the possible future structures of
the international news agency net¬
works;
on international film and television
distribution patterns and the influence
of multinational companies on commun¬
ication flow;
on the ¡mages of foreign countries
representing different social systems
and stages of development as they
are portrayed by the international
mass media.
In addition there will be further
work on the laws relating to the inter¬
national exchange of audiovisual
media and ways of facilitating the
transmission of press dispatches and
the exchange of programmes bet¬
ween countries. The present criteria
for "news values" will be further
examined.
All these studies will be important
in any possible future attempts to
define a "right to communicate".
They will also be necessary before the
ideal of cross-cultural communication
becomes more than an idle dream.

TELEVISIONS
ONE-WAY TRAFFIC
by Hifzi Topuz
THERE are about 1,000 million
televiewers in the world today.
The distribution-pattern of the
programmes which supply this vast
market reveals that the less-devel¬
oped countries are major importers
of TV programme material, obtained
from a number of rich countries.
The concept of the free circulation

only to the wealthy countries which
are in a position to produce TV pro¬
grammes. The poor countries are
dependent on the rich countries for
much of their television programming.
Cost is a fundamental factor in de¬
termining the world-wide flow of tele¬
vision material. It is often cheaper
for a country to fill its air time by
buying elsewhere. For example, a
programme which may have cost
$ 100,000 to make might be bought
by a small country for as little as
$ 500, since the price is based on
the number of sets in the purchasing
country and not on production costs.

many) towards the less developed
countries. The U.S.S.R. also exports
a substantial proportion of its pro¬
grammes, but this flow is more limited
and is directed for the most part
towards the other socialist countries.
The U.S.A. alone sells between
100,000 and 200,000 programme-
hours per year to television networks
in other countries. The second
biggest programme exporter is the
U.K., which annually markets be¬
tween 20,000 and 30,000 programme-
hours, followed by France (15,000
to 20,000 hours) and the Fed. Rep.
of Germany (5,000 to 6,000 hours).
Most countries import some tele¬
vision programmes, but the proportion
of imported material in their total
broadcast output varies widely, from
1 per cent to (in some cases) 100
per cent.
Among the countries which rely
to a very small extent on imported
material are China, Japan, the
U.S.S.R., France, the U.K. and
Italy.
Countries which are heavily de¬
pendent on foreign imports for their
television programming include: Saudi
Arabia (Aramco TV, 100 per cent;
Riyadh TV, 31 per cent); Guatemala
(84 per cent); Singapore (78 per
cent); New Zealand (75 per cent);
Malaysia (71 per cent); Iceland (67
per cent); Zambia (64 per cent);
Nigeria (63 per cent); Uruguay (62
per cent); Australia and Yemen (57
per cent); Kuwait, Chile and Israel
(55 per. cent); Ireland (54 per cent);
Iraq (52 per cent) ; Dominican Republic
(50 per cent); Canada RC (46 per
cent); Bulgaria (45 per cent); Egypt
(41 per cent); Hungary and Finland
(40 per cent); Mexico (Telesistema)
and Norway (39 per cent); Pakistan
and Portugal (35 per cent); Colombia
(34 per cent). .
One cause of the unbalanced flow,
as we have seen, is the wealth of
the exporting countries, which gives
them a powerful advantage as pro¬
ducers of television material.
The richer a country is, the more
self-sufficient it will be in terms of
television programmes. The poorer
it is, the more it will depend on
programmes from other countries.
Secondly, many of the developing
countries initially had neither a film
industry nor technicians capable of
building up a television network.
Consequently, they had to depend
on the major industrialized countries
for their equipment and know-how.
Their dependence is not limited to
the initial stages, but persists when
they introduce colour television.
There is no simple rule, however.
Such well-to-do countries as Austra¬
lia and New Zealand rely heavily on
foreign imports to fill their air time
(57 and 75 per cent, respectively).
By no means everyone is satisfied
with this lop-sided relationship be¬
tween the producers and the pur¬
chasers of television programmes.
Some see it as a threat to cultural
traditions. Others complain that
the exchange of programmes is gov¬
erned by commercial considerations,
that programmes are conceived as
products and are addressed to "cus¬
tomers" rather than "viewers".
It is also stressed that most of the
programmes which are exported and
which dominate the international
market were intended to entertain
viewers in their countries of origin
and that their contents do not corres¬
pond to the needs of the societies
which import them.
There are some encouraging signs,
however. The increasing activity of
regional broadcasting unions may
promote a more balanced flow. At
the same time there is a growing
tendency to exchange television news
within and between regions, together
with a greater willingness on the part
of- countries with different political
and social systems to engage in co-
production ventures.

programmes and news is thus an un¬
balanced one. Research has shown
that "television traffic" moves along
a one-way street.

and analysis by two Finnish university
teachers of the international flow of
TV programme material (1).

main streams runs from the major

second anniversary of the creation
of the system known as the "Pool"

agencies.
The idea of the Pool grew out of
the awareness that the circulation
of news reports and information about
and among the non-aligned coun¬
tries was insufficient and lagging far
behind the relations developing
among them at the political and
economic levels.
Current efforts to build a new inter¬
national economic order inevitably
stimulated initiatives for change in
the structure of information, which
for decades had been based on a
one-way flow of news from the deve¬
loped to the developing countries
under the influence of a small number
of news agency giants in the deve¬
loped world.
On the basis of recommendations
adopted at the Fourth Summit Confe¬

in Algiers in 1973, bilateral exchanges
of views took place between the
news agencies of some ten non-

bilities of joint action to change

LIGIMED COUNTRIES
THEIR NEWS
' S*2*
Full agreement was reached and in
January 1975 the Yugoslav news
agency, Tanjug, launched the collec¬
tion and redistribution of news reports
among the non-aligned countries.
This was a modest start. Many
difficulties lay ahead, and some of
them persist even today. One of the
greatest is undoubtedly the low level
of development of national informa¬
tion media and a corresponding inad¬
equacy in their technical facilities.
Many of the countries which wel¬
comed this initiative with most
enthusiasm still face the problem
of how to ensure sufficiently speedy
reception and retransmission of daily
news reports from or to the regional
points of the Pool which redistribute
reports to the news agencies of the
other non-aligned countries.
Even in its early stages, however,
the exchange of news reports and
information among the news agencies
of the non-aligned countries provoked
an immediate reaction. At all sub¬
sequent meetings of the non-aligned
countries, it was given full support.
It was generally agreed that news
agency dispatches, when promptly
.transmitted and authentic in content,
are unsurpassed in immediacy and
effect as announcements of events as
they occur. Together with subse¬
quent news agency reports, they
make an instant and incisive impact
on public opinion.
The initial dispatch is the precursor
and often also the basis of articles,
commentaries, features and even
more extensive coverage. Therefore,
it is understandable that the major
international news agencies should
seek to maintain a world-wide pre¬
sence through high-speed, well-
presented news reports prepared with
enviable professionalism.
But it is equally understandable
that the non-aligned countries, most
of which committed themselves to
the development of their own infor¬
mation media at the height of theirs
struggles for liberation, ¡ndepen-r

>dence and emancipation, should wish
to make their voice heard. These
aspirations gave birth to the vision
of joint action which has now mate¬
rialized as the Pool.
The Pool was officially constituted
at the meeting of information mini¬
sters and news agency directors of
62 non-aligned countries held in
New Delhi in July 1976. At this
meeting, , the Pool's statute was
adopted and a co-ordination com¬
mittee formed. All the resolutions
of the meeting were endorsed a
month later by heads of State or
government at the Non-Aligned Sum¬
mit in Colombo (Sri Lanka).
The first meeting of the Pool co¬
ordination committee, held in Cairo
in January 1977, noted that more
than 40 news agencies in Africa, Asia.
Latin America and Europe were
already contributing actively to the
news flow of the Pool, and that since
1975, national news agencies had
been formed for the first time in
16 non-aligned countries. Five
news agencies were already function¬
ing as regional or multilateral col¬
lectors and redistributors of news
reports and information from other
agencies participating in the Pool.
FURTHERMORE, 1976 had seen
an exceptional number of inter¬
national gatherings in the infor¬
mation field which were of particular
importance to the non-aligned coun¬
tries. These meetings ranged from a
symposium on information in Tunis, a
seminar in Mexico, the New Delhi
conference, and an Arab-European
news agencies' meeting, to the
Unesco General Conference in Nai¬
robi, where information and especially
the non-aligned news agencies' Pool
were examined in detail.
At its Cairo meeting the co-ordina¬
tion committee was thus able to
assess that the Pool had rapidly deve¬
loped during 1976 and that this new
form of multilateral co-operation
among the non-aligned countries in
matters of information had made
great strides.
The Pool is a tangible example of
co-operation among equals, on a
voluntary and democratic basis.
From the outset, it was never con¬
ceived as a supra-national news
agency of the non-aligned countries.
We believe that it will help to
enhance mutual knowledge among
the non-aligned countries and to
reinforce their unity. We are also
fully aware that the non-aligned
movement is in no way a mono¬
lithic block, nor in any way subject to
the will of a single centre. It is a
movement marked by great diversity,
but also by strong, identical interests.
The manner in which the Pool
functions is the best proof of its
democratic basis. A news agency
is considered as a participant if it
transmits its selection of news
reports to one or more of the Pool's
collector-redistributor news agencies.
The process involved is simple.
Each participant agency transmits by
the means at its disposalteleprinter,
telex, airmailone or more of its
news reports daily to a Pool redistri¬
bution centre.
EACH agency selects which re¬
ports it will send to the Pool.
A redistributing news agency
translates the reports it receives into
languages in which it usually
transmits abroad, scrupulously res¬
pecting the substance of the news
received.
Tanjug, for example, redistributes a
six-hour daily total of news for the
Pool in French, English and Spanish.
Its average newscast for the Pool
contains between 30 and 40 items
from the news services of national
news agencies of the non-aligned
countries and also from Unesco and
the Office of Public Information of the
United Nations.
The constantly increasing number
of news agencies ready to function as
collector-distributors is particularly
encouraging. In addition to the five
agencies which had accepted this
responsibility up to the time of the
co-ordination committee meeting
in Cairo, nine more have expressed
their readiness to include Pool news
in their regular foreign newscasts.
This concrete form of co-operation
among the non-aligned is in no way
viewed as a challenge to or compe¬
tition with existing news reporting
systems. The Pool's function is to
fill the previously existing vacuum
in the international information sys¬
tem, and it is in this sense that it
becomes increasingly attractive.
If it is to develop, the Pool will
require the support and willingness
to co-operate expressed during the
Unesco General Conference in
Nairobi. The Pool's co-ordination
committee is in favour of using any
resources Unesco may make avail¬
able for its development, to provide
assistancein the first placeto the
least developed news agencies in
the non-aligned world, in other words,
to developing countries planning to
form their own national agencies.
Although the Pool and the agree¬
ments reached in New Delhi received
wide coverage in the press of many
countries, with favourable responses
and objective assessments, certain
of the mass media in the highly indu¬
strialized countries reacted with
unease, and attempted to belittle the
Pool and distort its true nature.
It was claimed that the non-
aligned countries were forming a
news agency with the intention of
imposing a monopoly and censorship
in the reporting of news in their coun¬
tries, that this was an attack on the
free flow of news and information,
and so on.
It is patently absurd to maintain
that the non-aligned countries intend
to create a monopoly in the news
agency world.
Even if they had the material, pro¬
fessional and technical capacities to
do so, this would be impossible,
because the entire force and attraction
of the policy of non-alignment lie in
its uncompromising fight against all
types of monopoly and domination.
The non-aligned countries are enga¬
ged in this form of co-operation as
part of their quest for ways of streng¬
thening their own information media
and promoting a better flow of
information so that public opinion in
their respective countries and beyond
may be better informed.
IF this is felt by some as a threat
to their interests and positions,
the cause is not in any design to
seek a confrontation with existing
highly developed systems, but rather
in the objective clash between differ¬
ing concepts: a clash which occurs,
furthermore, in many other domains
of political and economic relations
throughout the world.
The publication rate of items from
the Pool newscast is still modest, but
it is improving daily. The quality,
substance and presentation of the
material provided is also constantly
improving, while an increasing num¬
ber of news agencies of non-aligned
countries are actively participating
in the Pool.
Thus, the principle of the Pool,
widely accepted by the non-aligned
countries during the first two years
of its existence, is now becoming a
reality. Interest in the Pool has also
been shown by several news agencies
and other bodies concerned with
information outside the non-aligned
world, where the Pool is increasingly
making its presence felt in the mass
media.
It is obvious that a new dialogue
has begun in international communi¬
cation, and that the process of build¬
ing a new international information
system is under way. Difficulties
clearly lie ahead and change will not
be rapid, but the process which has
been initiated cannot be arrested or
reversed.
The best contribution to the quest
for the most widely acceptable solu¬
tions will be to continue the dialogue
among all those who have an interest
in the world of informationa dia¬
logue which must take place between
equals.

A VOICE FROM
THE THIRD WORLD
Towards
a 'new world order
of information'
by Ridha Najar
RIDHA NAJAR, Tunisian journalist and sociologist specializing in
the field of Information, is attached to the Institut de Presse et des
Sciences de l'Information (Press and Information Sciences Institute)
in Tunis. He has been technical adviser to the Director-General ot
the Tunisian Radio and Television Service and editor-in-chief of
Tunisia's television news.
INCONTESTABLY, 1976 was the
year in which the problems of
information and communication
became world-wide issues. A whole
series of conferences, symposia and
meetings on these subjects launched
a major debate and the issues were
fully aired at the 19th session of
Unesco's General Conference last
November in Nairobi, Kenya.
Today the countries of the Third
World are demanding a "new world
order of information". What does
this expression mean? What are
the immense stakes in this debate,
which poses questions that are at
one and the same time cultural, eco¬
nomic and political?
How can the countries of the Third
World take the first urgent steps to
improve communication between
themselves? How can they help to
limit the quantity of "one-way infor¬
mation" which for years has relegated
them to the role of consumerswithout
calling in question the very principle
of a free, balanced (and thereby fruit¬
ful) exchange of information between
nations?
How will it be possible progressi¬
vely to achieve the "balanced flow
of information" of which so much is f

heard today, as a means of achieving
better communication between peoples,
and hence promoting greater inter¬
national understanding and world
peace, which is so often jeopardized
by major historical and cultural mis¬
understandings?
The preamble to the resolution sub¬
mitted by Tunisia on behalf of the
non-aligned countries at the General
Conference in Nairobi points out that
Unesco has a contribution to make in
"liberating the developing countries
from the state of dependence result¬
ing from specific historical circum¬
stances which still characterizes
their communication and information
systems."
Just as people once referred to
"political and economic decoloniza¬
tion", they now speak of the "deco¬
lonization of information" which is
inseparable from the achievement of
a new universal humanism founded
on dialogue and mutual respect.
The developing countries continue
to "consume" world information as
it is conceived in the main by the
industrialized nations.
This information tends to maintain
the people of the Third World in a
state of alienation. It also keeps
the peoples of the Western countries
in a dangerous state of ignorance
regarding the realities of the Third
World countries, lulling them with the
complacent assumption that Western
industry, technology and culture, in
short, Western civilization as a whole,
are superior.
A serious matter, and one which
lends itself to all kinds of misunder¬
standings, is that in the name of a
certain concept of the "freedom" and
"free flow" of information, most of the
large Western news agencies cons¬
ciously or unconsciously disseminate
information which is fragmentary,
schematic and frequently distorted
concerning the complex realities of
the developing countries.
Conversely, the information which
they distribute in the Third World
countries is sometimes dangerously
loaded with the overtones of alien
cultures.
The Report of the Symposium of
Non-Aligned Countries on Communi¬
cation, held in Tunis in March 1976,
goes as far as considering that, for
these international agencies, infor¬
mation is "a commodity... in whose
processing and transmission inter¬
vene considerations which tend to
perpetuate a system of domination
in which the authentic interests of
the developing countries are consis¬
tently ignored or misinterpreted".
Is it surprising therefore that the
citizen of the Third World ends up
by accepting the vision of himself
presented by the mass media ?
The technological superiority of
the industrially developed countries
is constantly growing as a result of
modern progress, and their media
networks deluge the Third World
countries, which are far less well-
endowed with technical equipment
and trained personnel, with their
own brand of information.
There is no point in even men¬
tioning communication satellites.
Their "use by developing countries
is subject to the will of those who
possess the advanced technology,
and by it can decisively influence
the economic, political and social
reality of the developing countries" ( 1 ).
(1) Report of the Symposium of Non-
Aligned Countries on Communication, Tunis,
March 1976.
This, then, is the state of the world
as far as information is concerned.
In the 1970s it has forced the Third
World countries to make a harsh
appraisal of their position.
The newly-independent countries,
believing that they had defeated
direct colonialization, realized that
their development remained in jeo¬
pardy, that their demands for a new
economic order could not make them¬
selves heard, and that their cultural
identity could never be achieved
without a substantial change in the
world system of disseminating infor¬
mation.
What is the solution to this prob¬
lem ? How can better communi¬
cation between the countries of the
Third World be established? What
measures will help to achieve a more
balanced flow of information between
North and South, and vice versa?
In an attempt to find an answer
to these interrelated questions, let
us consider the action taken by the
non-aligned countries (see also article
page 18).
Meeting in Algiers, in September
1973, the Fourth Summit Conference
of Non-Aligned Countries recommen¬
ded that a joint plan of action should
be worked out in the field of commu¬
nications.
An international symposium concer¬
ned with ways and means of deve¬
loping the flow of information be¬
tween the non-aligned countries was
held in Tunis in March 1976. The
recommendations adopted at the
symposium lay in two main direc¬
tions:
the consolidation (or creation) of
telecommunication networks, ini¬
tially at the national and later at
the regional and continental levels;

Bertolt Brecht and Unesco
on communication
Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), the world-famous German playwright and
poet, wrote in his Theory of Radio (1927-1932) :
"Here is a proposal designed to transform the way radio is used,
and thus to reveal its constructive aspects: it must be transformed
from an instrument of distribution into an instrument of communication.
Radio could be the most remarkable instrument of communication
imaginable in public life, a vast network of communication-channels.
Or rather, it could be such an instrument if it were capable not only of
sending out but also of receiving; not only of getting its audience to listen
but also of getting them to speak; not of isolating them but of bringing
them into contact with their fellows. If this is to come about, radio
must cease to be simply a provider and organize a supply furnished
by listeners themselves".
Bertolt Brecht. Schriften 2 (Zur Literatur und Kunst, Politik und
Gesellschaft) (Writings 2. On Literature and Art, Politics and Society).
It is interesting to compare Brechts ideas with those set out in Unesco's
Medium-Term Plan (1977-1982):
"Although the notion of 'the free flow of information' goes back
some 50 years, it has been invoked as a concept... only since the end
of the Second World War... Although the word 'communication' was
already current at that time in English-language texts, what was meant,
in fact, was a rather one-sided dissemination of information. It was
only much later that there emerged the concept of communication in
its true sense (from the Latin communicare: to make common, to share)
no longer implying merely an active transmitter and a passive receiver,
but allowing for feedback from the latter of a kind to modify the behaviour
of the former or, better still, requiring the active participation of all
concerned in the communication process, which thus becomes a pluri-
dimensional flow of information with multiple feedback."
the development of co-operation
and exchanges between the non-
aligned countries in all branches
of communication: news agencies,
the press, radio and television,
news films, the cinema, exhibitions,
festivals, tourism, research, the
training of personnel and so on.
Implementation of the first set of
recommendations would helpto bridge
the technological gap between the
industrialized countries and those of
the Third World.
The second group of directives
invites the non-aligned countries to
produce their own information and
circulate it amongst themselves in
order to counter-balance the essen¬
tially one-way flow of information
originating in the developed countries.
Far from wishing to supplant or
short-circuit the transnational news
agencieseven if this were possible-
intercommunication between the
Third World countries should seek
to fill the gaps which those agencies
leave (whether intentionally or other¬
wise), to compensate for their om¬
issions and above all to provide more
regular information gathered in the
countries which it concerns.
Nothing would appear more justi¬
fiable than the demand of peoples for
the fundamental right to voice their
own preoccupations, and to tell the
world about their life, their culture
and their efforts to achieve deve¬
lopment.
The most important point of all is
not merely that this intercommunica¬
tion should be established, but that
information should reach as wide a
public as possible.
This will be a long-term task, for it
will be necessary to stimulate fresh
pockets of interest in a public long
accustomed to "consuming" infor¬
mation originating in one part of the
world alone. National news agen¬
cies, cinema, press, and particularly
radio and television will have an
important role to play in this respect.
This multi-directional co-operation
calls for both adequate equipment
and trained personnel, and, together
with a general awareness of the
situation, a realization of the under¬
lying moral obligations.
Such an awareness now exists.
The problems of equipment and
personnel were indeed examined
at Nairobi by Unesco's General
Conference. What remains to be
achieved is agreement concerning an
international code of ethics in the field
of information. Here there will be
many difficulties, because points of
view still differ greatly, but there are,
nevertheless, certain grounds for
hope.
At Nairobi, the non-aligned coun¬
tries tabled a proposal which had
the merit of setting the debate
within a practical framework. This
proposal recommended that efforts
be made to create an improved ba¬
lance in the world flow of information,
with the establishment of a vast
programme of aid designed to assist
the developing countries in extending
their information systems.
The proposal was adopted unani¬
mously. It advocated in particular
measures to counteract disparities
in news transmission rates, and to
support regional groupings, news
agency pools and national and inter¬
national unions of journalists.
This programme of technical and
financial aid to the developing coun¬
tries, together with the international
research programme for communi¬
cation which has been recommended
by Unesco since 1970, should lead
to a reduction of the technological
gap between' the Third World and'
the industrialized countries.
If information is no longer to be
treated as a "commodity", and
become instead a "service" at the
disposal of all mankind, and if a new
world order in the field of information
is to be established, the Third World
countries must consolidate their
information media.
Here again, the problems should be
posed in the context of mutually
beneficial international co-operation,
rather than in a context of sterile
confrontation and pointless verbal
arguments.

The mass media and society
A SOVIET
VIEWPOINT
The transmitting

533-metre-high

television tower in
Moscow broadcasts
directly to receivers
within a 120 km radius.
Equipped for
meteorological
observations and the
transmission of weather

brigades, radio

INFORMATION media play an im¬
portant role in a socialist society.
They promote economic and cul¬
tural progress, strengthen friendship
between peoples and inculcate the
highest moral values in the individual.
After the Revolution of October
191?, private ownership of the press
and other information media was
abolished in the Soviet Union and
these media became social property.
The Constitution of the U.S.S.R.
provides for both freedom of speech
and freedom of the press, which are
ensured in practice by putting the
workers and their organizations in
charge not only of the supply of
paper and the use of printing plant,
but of publishing works, news¬
papers, periodicals, radio stations
and television transmitters.
Newspapers, periodicals and other
publications in the U.S.S.R. are
produced by organizations of the
Communist Party, trade unions,
women and young people, and by
artists' societies, collectives formed
by academic institutions, factories
and State farms. Thus we have in
the Soviet Union a press which
serves the workers and we can there¬
fore say that the mass information
media are at the service of the
entire people.
YASSEN N. ZASURSKY. Dean of the
Faculty of Journalism at Moscow University,
has participated in a number of International
meetings sponsored by Unesco and other
international organizations in the field of
mass communication.
YURI I. KASHLEV, Sower journalist and
historian, was a member of the U.S.S.R.
delegation at the nineteenth session of Unes¬
co's General Conference at Nairobi (Kenya)
in 1976.

In this way, genuine freedom of
the pressfreedom for the working
massesis achieved, a situation quite
different, of course, from that which
existed in Tsarist Russia and about
which Lenin wrote as follows:
"Freedom of the press in the capita¬
list world amounts to freedom of
buying newspapers, buying writers,
bribing and 'fabricating' public opi¬
nion in favour of the bourgeoisie.
This is a fact no one will ever be able
to deny."
The October Revolution provided
the masses with wide access at first
to newspapers and periodicals, and
later to radio and television broad¬
casting. Every Soviet citizen has
the chance to express his views in a
newspaper or periodical, or to parti¬
cipate in radio and television broad¬
casts.
Half the space in every newspaper
is devoted to contributions from
workers in industry and agriculture
and all letters received by the edi¬
tors are carefully considered. More¬
over, it is now true that any Soviet
citizen, of whatever nationality he
may be, can write a letter or send
information to a newspaper, because
he is literate, educated and possesses
a broad outlook enabling him to make
his own judgements about life.
All this is despite the fact that
only 60 years ago there were vast
regions of almost complete illiteracy
in Russia, particularly in its remoter
areas.
This is how a socialist society esta¬
blishes and safeguards the right of
every individual to participate in the
activity of the mass media.
It would be no exaggeration to say
that millions of Soviet citizens have
been able to express their views in
newspapers and periodicals, on radio
and television, thus helping to lay
the foundations of the policies which
were adopted and approved by the
recent 25th Congress of the Commu¬
nist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).
Thus, the broad masses of the
workers are involved not only in the
social and cultural life of the country
but also in the creation of public
opinion, which is the affair of each
and every individual.
When discussing this involvement.
one must bear in mind the scale on
which mass information has deve¬
loped in the Soviet Union in the
space of a few decades. Today in
the U.S.S.R. there are almost 8,000
newspapers with a total circulation of
more than 168 million copies per
issue, together with 4,726 periodicals
and magazines, which have a total
annual circulation of almost 4,000
million.
The circulation of such leading
newspapers as Pravda (the organ of
the Communist Party) or Komsomol-
skaya Pravda (the organ of the
Communist Youth League) exceeds
10 million copies. For every Soviet
family there are on average more
than four periodicals and one out
of every four books in the world is
published in the Soviet Union.
In addition, the U.S.S.R. pos¬
sesses 370 long-range and 1,400
other television relay stations, to¬
gether with more than 60 reception
stations linked to the "Orbita" space
communication system. Finally, the
population owns more than 60 mil¬
lion televisions and more than 110 k
million radio sets. And these num- r
Mass media in the U.S.S.R. have been entrusted with great responsibilities in the educational process,
which combines specialized with all-round training. During their time at university, many Soviet
students travel vast distances across the country to participate in major industrial, hydroelectric and
railway construction projects. Here, young people from many regions meet in a Central Asian Republic.

bers have certainly not yet reached
their maximum.
Soviet journalists consequently
have at their disposal an instrument
of enormous social, cultural and
psychological potential; people and
society have a right to demand from
them a high degree of responsibility,
especially during the present period
of "information explosion".
The distinguishing feature of jour¬
nalism in a socialist society is its
humanist attitude, displayed in its
concern with the inculcation in
people of the highest and noblest
human qualities. Soviet journalism
constantly devotes itself to the
aesthetic, ethical and artistic educa¬
tion of Soviet people, and to prepar¬
ing them for practical daily tasks.
At the same time, it is concerned to
criticize greed, selfish individualism,
proprietary instincts, and so on.
Journalism in a socialist society
also pays particular attention to the
consolidation of international friend¬
ship. Newspapers in the Soviet
Union, for example, are published in
the 56 languages of the peoples of
the U.S.S.R., including some which
were not available in written form to
their peoples during the Tsarist era,
and in nine foreign languages.
In a socialist society, the dissemi¬
nation of ideas which instigate ra¬
cism, war or racial division between
peoples is forbidden and is specifi¬
cally prohibited by legislation.
" We must also remember that jour¬
nalism in a socialist society is not
subject to commercial pressures;
sensationalism is therefore quite
foreign to it. Socialist journalism is
not a means of enriching some
publisher or journalist, it is not an
object of commercial transaction and
is in no way dependent on sponsors.
Soviet journalists, while enjoying
the freedom of the press set forth in
the Constitution, are conscious of their
responsibility to the people. They
realize that the words they usetruth,
progress, humanismshould contri¬
bute positively to the struggle for
peace and mutual understanding bet¬
ween peoples. In socialist societies,
the notions of freedom and responsi¬
bility are inseparable.
Now let us look at the internatio¬
nal aspect of the problem of the
dissemination of information.
The statistical yearbooks of Unesco
reveal that in the world today there
are in total about 922 million radio
receivers and 350 million televisions,
while many thousands of news¬
papers, together with about 1,500
new books, appear every 24 hours.
Through these channels, hundreds of
millions of people daily learn about
international politics and the life and
culture of other peoples.
But precisely what do they learn ?
And who decides what they are to
learn? Here again, we are dealing
with a problem of fundamental im
portance, which has several aspects.
Firstly, in the developed countries
of the West, the overwhelming majo¬
rity of the means by which informa¬
tion is collected, formulated and
transmitted belong, as everyone
knows, to a comparatively small sec¬
tion of the population. Obviously,
therefore, it would be naive to main¬
tain that these people are concerned
only with the dissemination of infor¬
mation and make no attempt to in¬
fluence its content.
Internationally as well, the infor¬
mation media are dominated by a
handful of giant news agencies and
radio and television companies. A
specific category of people in Wes¬
tern society thus exerts a dispropor¬
tionate influence on the content and
the tendency of the information
distributed throughout the world,
while the benefit or the harm which
this influence may bring to the cause
of peace and mutual understanding
depends on the political stance of
this minority.
Secondly, one must face up to
another regrettable fact of the mo¬
dern world, namely the existence of
so-called "psychological warfare"
and all its trappings. The world in¬
formation media are littered with the
remnants of the "Cold War", in the
form of various radio stations, organs
of the press and publishing houses,
which interfere in the internal affairs
of other peoples. These constitute
an obstacle to the development of
good international relations in the
field of information.
Thirdly and finally, there is an enor¬
mous imbalance in the distribution of
information and of the mass media
themselves throughout the world.
This is a relic of colonialism: informa¬
tion media are overwhelmingly con¬
centrated in highly developed States,
while the majority of developing
countries, which do not even possess
modern systems of communication of
their own, can make only a meagre
contribution to the international flow
of information.
Unesco experts have calculated
that the Third World, in which the
majority of mankind lives, receives
100 times more information than it
transmits to the Western countries.
With increasing frequency, the lea¬
ders of the developing countries are
calling attention to this dangerous
anomaly, which has been described
as "information imperialism". At the
Fifth Summit Conference of Non-
Aligned Countries in Colombo (1 976),
the participants noted that the esta¬
blishment of a new international order
in information was no less urgent
a task than the establishment of a
new international economic order.
So, on the one hand we are faced
with serious problems relating to the
dimensions of the international spread
of information while, on the other
hand, there is a clearly increasing
demand for the exchange of informa
tion. This demand stems not only
from scientific and technical progress,
but also from the growth of economic
and cultural ties between different
peoples in the period of détente. It
is against this background that we
must ask how the links between
States can and must be developed in
such a complex and sensitive area.
Clearly, the concept of a "free flow
of information", in the one-sided way
in which it is so often treated, cannot
serve as the basis for such internatio¬
nal development.
As is well known, the freedom of
one individual ends where the free¬
dom of another begins. The concept
of an unconditional "free flow" disre¬
gards the national sovereignty of
States by implying that they are
obliged to open all their doors to any
information from abroad, even that
which is unfriendly or hostile and has
a harmful influence on young people.
The "free flow" concept is also at
variance with the legislation of coun¬
tries such as the U.S.S.R. whose
laws prohibit propaganda for war and
racial or national strife, and attacks
on the dignity of peoples.
Furthermore, many international
documents, (including the Internatio¬
nal Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, Articles 19 and 20), provide
for restriction of the free dissemina¬
tion of information when the latter
constitutes a threat to national secu-

rity or to public health or morals,
when it consists of propaganda for'
war or when it advocates national or
racial hatred.
Freedom of the press at the inter¬
national level must therefore take into
account two important factors.
The first of these concerns the res¬
ponsibility of the mass information
media and those engaged in com¬
munication. The information disse¬
minated must not provoke hosti¬
lity between peoples, nor must it
provoke war or colonialism. It
should help to create mutual under¬
standing between peoples and the
spiritual growth of the personality.
The second consideration is that,
in order to achieve a truly free flow of
information, all peoples must have
the opportunity to make their voices
heard.
Both these problemsthe respon¬
sibility of the media themselves and
the correction of the existing disequi¬
librium in the circulation' of informa¬
tion now central to the preoc¬
cupations of society, journalists and
international organizations. Indeed,
matters related to the dissemination
of information have already been
discussed at a number of top-level
international conferences.
At the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe, held in
Helsinki in 1975, the heads of
35 States reached agreement on co
operation in the sphere of informa¬
tion with a view to furthering the
cause of peace, mutual understanding
and the enrichment of the human
spirit. It was also agreed that this
co-operative effort would be based
on the fundamental principles of
equality, respect for sovereignty,
non-interference in the internal affairs
of other peoples, and respect for
human rights and basic freedoms.,
Implementation of the relevant
provisions of the Final Act signed at
Helsinki has already led to an increa¬
singly wide dissemination of informa¬
tion in the signatory States and to
the improvement of professional
conditions for journalists.
The principles of the international
dissemination of information, toge¬
ther with the problems of responsibi¬
lity for the mass media, have recently
been discussed at conferences of
developing countriesin Tunis, Costa
Rica, New Delhi and Colombo.
Unesco's extensive work in the
information field is most valuable.
For several years now, the Organi¬
zation has been working on a draft
"Declaration on fundamental prin¬
ciples governing the use of the mass
media in strengthening peace and
international understanding and in
combating war propaganda, racism
and apartheid".
y This draft not only establishes that
"freedom of expression, information
and opinion are fundamental human
rights" and that "States should
encourage the freer and wider dis¬
semination of information", but
refers also to the particular respon¬
sibility borne by the mass media in
promoting mutual understanding
between peoples. Finally, it points
to the necessity of supporting the
establishment of national mass media
in the developing countries and the
training of their personnel.
The document sparked off lively
discussions at Unesco's recent Gene¬
ral Conference in Nairobi. The press
of certain countries distorted its
contents, claiming that it proposed
State control over the mass media.
Many other interesting projects
are included in Unesco's plans for the
next few years, including some
concerned with assistance to the
developing countries and research
into the concepts of balance and
responsibility in the media.
In conclusion, we must recognize
that life itself compels us to take a
fresh look at the problems involved
in the international circulation of
information, the relationship between
freedom and responsibility, content
and balance, and all other aspects
of this twentieth-century pheno¬
menon, the mass media.

The mass media and society
AN AMERICAN
VIEWPOINT
by William G. Harley
COMMUNICATION in any so¬
ciety, together with the kinds
of systems through which it
will flow, will differ according not
only to that society's degree of natio¬
nal development but also according
to the entire range of its cultural,
social, economic, and political values
and traditions.
A major tradition of the Western
industrialized nations is the convic¬
tion that a free press is vital to demo¬
cratic government. Such protection is
accorded to the press because the
free flow of ideas and information
among individuals as well as States
is essential undergirding for the peo¬
ple's right to know and understand so
that they can govern themselves.
A free press (including electronic
journalism) serves three major func¬
tions in such a system of government.
First, it acts as a major information
source. It provides the raw material
from which free men and women form
opinions and make choices. The
media offer ever-present means for
every individual to keep abreast of
events at home and abroad, to be
aware of what is going on about him
and what may be expected, and to
select from a wide range of compet¬
ing opinions on matters of common
concern.
The media also arouse public inte¬
rest and increase public understand¬
ing by explaining complex issues in
such a way, as the BBC's Charles
Curran once put it, "as to reduce the
extent of incomprehension of the
basic facts of our society." The
media's information function is there-
WILLIAM G. HARLEY, President Emeritus
of the National Association of Educational
Broadcasters In the U.S.A., is a former Vice-
Chairman of the U.S. National Commission
for Unesco. He served as Senior Adviser to
the U.S. delegation at the 18th and 19th
sessions of Unesco's General Conference.
fore an essential element in a demo¬
cratic political process. This function
includes the dissemination not only of
ideas that have broad acceptance but
of minority views as well.
Such ; views have often through
time and discussion become those of
the majority; in any case, the right
of individuals or groups to dissent
from the ideas held at any particular
moment by the majority must be
protected and preserved.
Second, an unshackled press serves
as a monitor, observing and reporting
on the activities of government as
ombudsman for its citizens.
Operations of government are too
complex for individual citizens to
follow closely. A free and inde¬
pendent press serves this function
for them by constant scrutiny of how
authority is exercised, thus serving as
a vital check upon government and
against the abuse of powers by any
one group over any other group.
Thus, a free press is a safeguard of
all other freedoms.
Third, the press serves as liaison
between a State and its citizens.
It serves the latter as a sounding
board, permitting them openly to
voice criticism and complaints as
well as suggestions. Government
cannot function without constant two-
way communication with its citizens.
Not only do the media provide
channels for a constant flow of infor¬
mation to the people about the
services and plans of government,
but also through a variety of feedback
devices, they allow government to be
continually informed of the people's
opinion of its performance. A fully
informed public is the only reliable
basis for ensuring that a government
of any country is responsive to the
public will.
An important role played by the
electronic media in the political pro¬
cess consists in providing opportu-
\¿. >- \
nities for the electorate to see and
hear candidates and arranging for the
"live" transmission of sessions of
legislative and administrative bodies
where the people's business is being
transacted: broadcasts from legisla¬
tive bodies, city councils, school
boards, and public hearings.
Thus, a free press, protected by
democratic society, is in turn a bul¬
wark in maintaining the open and
effective working of that society.-
In addition to the functions of a
free press in relation to the political
system, the media play important
roles in social, cultural, and economic
areas. As instructional aids, they
supplement classroom teaching, help
people to make productive and reward¬
ing use of leisure, and provide a
variety of extra-mural learning oppor¬
tunities in areas where formal educa¬
tion systems have left a void.
The media are a major means of
cultural expression and provide a

The functions of the mass media today are constantly being expanded by advances in communication
technology, such as television cartridge systems, satellites, cable TV and computers. Above, what
the viewer does not see: in an American TV studio, "back-room" staff operate a huge battery of
electronic equipment to handle the flow of incoming dispatches during a news programme.
vehicle for enhancing traditional
indigenous cultural values as well as
for sharing the world's heritage of
cultural riches. The advent of minia¬
turized low-cost production equipment
and the spread of multi-channel cable
has provided the means for con¬
sumers themselves to become pro¬
ducers of a multiplicity of materials
and to have new outlets for creative
communication with their fellows.
For example, the U.S. multi-channel
cable systems provide public access
channels through which laymen can
transmit materials which they may
have produced with home cameras
and recording equipment.
In many Western societies, public
and private broadcasting systems
coexist. The privately owned media
are supported by advertising, which
in itself is a major form of commu¬
nication; moreover, they are impor¬
tant in promoting a free market
system and economic growth, since
advertising acquaints people with
goods and services and generates the
mass market that permits lowering
costs of production and distribution.
Private media, though motivated
by profit, believe, nonetheless, that
they serve a higher functionas guar¬
dians of the rights of people and as
constructive critics of government.
Moreover, in order to stay in business,
they must compete with one another
for public confidence and must main¬
tain credibility and a high level of
public service or lose their "cus¬
tomers".
Advertising income helps them to
maintain their independence and
withstand pressure from government
and private interest groups. It also
makes possible the establishment by
private entrepreneurs of an enor¬
mous number of newspapers, maga¬
zines and, in several nations, broad¬
casting stations.
This multiplicity of free and inde¬
pendent media guarantees that no
single voice or group of voices can
ever achieve predominance. Thus,
pluralism constitutes a strong safe¬
guard for a free and democratic
society. In addition, broadcasting
stations in the United States, for
example, grant private citizens and
groups the opportunity to reply on
the air to the expression of opinions
or advertising claims they find ques¬
tionable or exaggerated.
The familiar "letters to the editor"
columns in the newspapers provide
a similar right of reply to the printed
media. Moreover, the increasing
growth and vigour of consumer
groups which monitor advertising
claims safeguard the public, and the
reports of their protests, which the
press carry, enhance public sophisti¬
cation in judging advertising.
Whatever the dangers that could k
result from concentrated ownership t

of media in private hands, it is no¬
where so dangerous as leaving to a
concentration of government bureau¬
crats the power to decide what is to
be reported and what cannot.
Freedom of the press is an accoun¬
table freedom. In return for the as¬
surance of its freedom, the press
voluntarily accepts a social and ethi¬
cal responsibility to demonstrate a
commensurate competence and ma¬
turity of judgement. The founders
of the Government of the United
States trusted that such a reciprocal
arrangement would be honoured.
For 200 years this vital freedomeven
though sometimes carried to excess
been an essential force in keep¬
ing that Government stable.
Responsibility and freedom of the
press derive reciprocally from the
right of an individual in a democratic
society to know and understand.
The relationship of the individual
person and a free society is one not
of opposition, conflict, or fear but of
mutuality.
Thus, the more the individual is
fulfilled, the more society can achieve,
and the more society can achieve,
the more opportunity there is for
individual fulfilment. To make such
a cycle succeed, it is essential that
the people's right to know and under¬
stand be exercised to the fullest
extent through the independent ope¬
ration of the full range of communi¬
cation technology.
The functions of the media in
Western society are continually en¬
hanced and extended by advances in
communication technology: television
cartridge systems, multiplexing,
satellites, cable, lasers, facsimile,
and computers.
By constantly exploiting the capa¬
cities of new systems and techniques
for reproducing, storing, retrieving,
and disseminating information and
applying them to rapidly changing

circumstances. Western nations are
able to increase their citizens' capa¬
bility for rational decision and appro¬
priate responses to events.
New communications technolo¬
gies make more information available
more widely and more quickly; and,
because of their greater flexibility
and capacity, they also afford impro¬
ved means through which people can
communicate readily with one ano¬
ther and have a more direct involve¬
ment in decision-making.
The coming of such advanced tech¬
nologies as satellites and packet data
systems also multiplies the versatility
and reach of communications inter¬
nationally, including the potential of
sending audio and video signals
simultaneously to every part of the
earth. Increasing the amount of
communication and the distances it
can be sent does not, of coursé, have
anything to do with its quality or
social usefulness.
Hence, as the technological poten¬
tial of the global free flow of informa¬
tion is achieved, it will place great
responsibility upon those who pro¬
duce and distribute programmes and
require great wisdom on the part of
international bodies and their consti¬
tuents in establishing principles and
agreements that will permit the ful¬
lest use of a space communications
system for constructive international
purposes, used in such a way that its
benefits can be shared by both rich
and poorer countries.
Otherwise, the overwhelming flow
of media from the industralized na¬
tions to the developing nations will
continue; and the wondrous new
developments in communications
machinery will only widen and deepen
the division of our global village into
the haves and have-nots.
Just as domestically the open ex¬
change of ideas and information
must be a true exchange if it is to be
effective, so, at the international
level, sharing the benefits of such
advanced technology as satellites
should increasingly include opportu¬
nities for access to this technology
for the purpose of sending as well as
receiving.
Moreover, free flow of information
internationally can be truly free only
if it is two-way. The United States
has offered to join other countries
with advanced communication capa¬
cities in endeavouring to make avai¬
lable, through binational or multi¬
national channels, both governmental
and private, assistance to developing
countries to help, them meet their
basic communication needs and thus
provide a practical means for them
to have their voices heard and to
enlarge their participation in the free
flow process.
The United States, which has been
foremost in communication satellite
development, is sensitive to the
concern of nations which fear pos¬
sible abuses by broadcasting satel
lites, but is seeking a solution which A
does not abridge the freedom to *
transmit and receive information.
In this regard, it is championing a
principle of freedom that has been
internationally proclaimed. It exists
in the laws of many countries, in the
Declaration of Human Rights, and in
other United Nations recommenda¬
tions and resolutions.
It is the view of the United States,
shared by a number of nations, that
some sort of policy framework is
necessary for the co-ordinatibn of
international communications.
The goal of the international com¬
munity should be to elicit from com¬
munication satellite technologies the
greatest possible benefits for all and
not to risk discouraging their poten¬
tial for good by imposing strictures
that might seriously jeopardize the
full development of the most power¬
ful means for world-wide furtherance
of free flow, expansion of education,
and promotion of understanding.
The potential quantum jump in
communication capacity posited by
the advent of the synchronous satel¬
lite offers the best hope for sharing
the world's store of knowledge in
such a way as to reduce the widening
disparities among nations.
Misdirected, it can become a force
for trivialization and deception, ex¬
ploitation, and disruption. Properly
developed through international
co-operation that is based upon un¬
derstanding of both the potential
assets and potential liabilities implicit
in its application, this most advanced
technology of communication can be
transformed into a beneficent-servant
of mankind.
If this promise is to be fulfilled, the
prerequisite must be an increased
understanding of the concept of a
free press throughout the world.

Unesco's first teleconference
by satellite
THE SYMPHONIE'
EXPERIMENT
by E. Lloyd Sommerlad
TELECOMMUNICATIONS will
eventually replace travel to
international, conferences of
the future by support staff and, in due
course, by participants themselves.
The first successful large-scale
experiment in "teleconferencing" pro¬
vided satellite links between Unesco
Headquarters in Paris and the Ken¬
yatta Conference Centre in Nairobi,
Kenya, for Unesco's 19th General
Conference in October and November
1976.
To the surprise of Unesco staff
members and delegates alike, and
despite organizational difficulties, the
conference, the first to be held away
from Headquarters for 20 years, pro¬
ceeded with almost the same ease
and speed as in Paris. This would
not have been possible without the
satellite.
During the five weeks of the confe¬
rence, instantaneous communication
was provided directly from the Confe¬
rence Hall in Nairobi via satellite to
Unesco in Paris, 6,400 kilometres
away. The Governments of France
and the Federal Republic of Germany;
which have been developing the
experimental satellite system called
"Symphonie" since 1967, placed it
and the necessary ground facilities
and technical staff at the disposal of
Unesco.
Launched in 1975, the satellite is
in geostationary orbit at an altitude of
36,000 kilometres, maintaining the
same position in relation to the earth
as it rotates. It is currently used for
various experiments in the technical,
scientific and educational fields.
E. LLOYD SOMMERLAD, Acting Head ot
Unesco's Division of Free Flow of Infor¬
mation and Communication Policies, is in
charge of Unesco's programme on the use
of space communication for education and
development. He was general co-ordinator
of the experimental satellite link between
Unesco's Paris H. Q. and its General Confe¬
rence in Nairobi (October-November 1976).
A small ground station with an
antenna measuring four and a half
metres in diameter was installed in
the grounds of the Conference Centre
in Nairobi, and began operating a
few days before the opening of Unes¬
co's General Conference. At the
other end, radio signals were trans¬
mitted from Unesco Headquarters in
Paris to an antenna at Pleumeur-
Bodou in Britanny (600 km. from
Paris) and thence to the satellite.
The objectives of the tele-confe¬
rence experiment were:
to determine the extent to which
the use of a communication satellite
link would enable the Unesco Secre¬
tariat and the permanent delegations
remaining in Paris to be directly asso¬
ciated with the conference activities
and to contribute to them;
to measure the utility of the satel¬
lite's various technical facilities (tele¬
phone, telex, facsimile, data trans¬
mission, radio and visiophone) for
the improvement of conference ser¬
vices (e.g. information, documenta¬
tion, translations, minute-writing,
interpretation) and to facilitate press
and broadcasting coverage;
to evaluate the extent to which
retention of certain staff groups at
Headquarters would be feasible if
similar conferences were held away
from Headquarters in the future.
One of the major functions of Sym¬
phonie was to relay to Paris the pro¬
ceedings of three conference meet¬
ings taking place simultaneously in
Nairobi. Each day's conference
schedule was transmitted to Paris by
facsimile, and the closed circuit tele¬
vision system at Headquarters indica¬
ted where and when the various
meetings could be followed.
Staff, delegations and press repre¬
sentatives could thus select the meet¬
ing that interested them and listen
to the debates in either English or
French. These six radio transmis¬
sions were also distributed to more

than 100 offices in the Headquarters
buildings through an internal com¬
munication system.
Another important feature of the
experiment was the flexibility of the
instantaneous communication facili¬
ties available. The system provided
six telephone lines, four telex circuits
and two facsimile machines at each
end. An urgent request for infor¬
mation or copy of a document could
be received by telephone and within
a few minutes the reply could be
delivered through telex or facsimile
to the central registry in Nairobi.
The facsimile machines, which
have great potential for expanded
use at future conferences, could
transmit a page of typed or printed
matter, tables or diagrams in about
three minutes. During the confe¬
rence, some 4,000 pages of docu¬
ments were transmitted to or from
Nairobi. These included the daily
Journal of the Conference, press
clippings, reference documents and
the texts of speeches and reports.
One important experiment involved
the transmission to Paris of facsi¬
miles of original texts in one language
(e.g. Arabic or Chinese), which were
translated into other languages, and
then retransmitted in facsimile to
Nairobi. A conclusion of this experi¬
ment is that it might be possible for
Unesco translators to remain at the
Paris Headquarters during future
conferences held elsewhere.
During the five weeks of the Nai¬
robi conference, more than 2,000 te¬
lephone calls and 1,500 telex mes¬
sages were exchanged via the satel¬
lite between staff members or
delegations.
Two circuits on the satellite were
reserved for a computer experiment.
A terminal in Nairobi linked to the
computer at Headquarters provided
access to stored documentation and
administrative information. It imme¬
diately answered questions in every
field of Unesco's activities.
A permanent radio link between
studios in Paris and Nairobi trans¬
mitted programmes originating in
Nairobi for copying and distribution
from Paris. It also permitted direct
transmission recording, and the edit¬
ing of important speeches made
during the conference's plenary meet¬
ings. This radio link also permitted
a series of group discussions between
Unesco staff members in Paris and
Nairobi.
The most spectacular facility was
the visiophone, which was used for
one hour a day, during which all
other communications were sus¬
pended due to the limited radio band
available from the small antenna in
Nairobi.
Studios in Nairobi and Paris were
equipped with monitors like small
TV screens and linked by the satellite,
permitting face-to-face meetings,
with communication both by ¡mage
and sound. A series of press confe¬
rences was organized, debates were
held between leading personalities,
and there were round-table discus¬
sions between members of Unesco's
staff.
The visiophone also provided an
opportunity for experiments in remote
simultaneous interpretation. But,
while this was a technical success,
the interpreters taking part later ex¬
pressed the need to see the room
and feel involved by the speaker's
presence.
The Symphonie experiments de¬
monstrated the utility of direct, large-
scale telecommunications in the serv¬
icing of distant conferences.
This pilot project was only a
beginning. Further technical ad¬
vances and organizational refine¬
ments will allow not merely two,
but many points on the earth's sur¬
face to be linked for stay-at-home
"tele-conferences", while the costs
of major international gatherings
should be greatly reduced through
savings in transport and travel as a
result of providing many conference
services by telecommunications.

Letters
to
the editor
HIGH RISE
CUT DOWN TO SIZE
Sir,
In his article on self-built homes
(Unesco Courier, June 1976), John
F. C. Turner mentions the demo¬
lition of a public housing project in
St. Louis, Missouri, incorrectly stating
that it was "blown up by the U. S.
Army".
In fact the St. Louis Housing Au¬
thority, which owned and operated
the project, contracted with private
companies to carry out an experiment
to determine the practicality of
reducing the height of several of the
33-storey structures. Although ex¬
plosives were used during this ope¬
ration, the final and major demoli¬
tion was done using more conven¬
tional techniques.
Mr. Turner's conclusion that the ,
project was torn down "because ma¬
nagement and maintenance had
become so uneconomical" is much
too brief. The sociological impact of
transplanting rural migrants and par¬
ticularly one-parent families into
densely populated high-rise apart¬
ments had been overlooked in the
rush to house them, and these socio¬
logical factors proved as disastrous
as the economic aspects of the
question.

WINDOW ON THE WORLD
Sir,
I am a young Cuban, fourteen years
old. At present I am in the third
year of a five-year course at the
teachers' training school in my pro¬
vince. I have always taken a keen
interest in current events throughout
the world and this is why I enjoy
reading the Unesco Courier so much.

UNDERSTANDING THE BRAIN
Sir,
Bravo for your issue on .research
into the mechanisms and functions
of the human brain (January 1976).
The clear, well-written articles
brought a complex, vast and pas¬
sionately interesting subject within
the comprehension of a broad, non-
specialist readership.
The issue was indeed "one of the
best pieces of popularization of
scientific material ever published"
as another reader, H. W. S. Philip,
put it in a letter published by you in
October 1976.

AFTER LITERACY,
WHAT NEXT?
Sir,
Simoni Malya's article "After
Literacy, What Next?" (February
1977 issue) made fascinating reading.
Tanzania's experiment in using tradi¬
tional folk-tales as reading materials
for the newly literate seems to me
extremely worthwhile, both as a
method of following up literacy teach¬
ing and as a way of preserving the
country's oral tradition.
I was particularly struck by the
problems encountered in reproducing
the stories in typed and stencilled
booklets. Why not go even further
and get the newly literate themselves
to do the printing ? An efficient,
easy-to-handle printing system could
be obtained relatively cheaply. In
some French schools pupils use such
equipment with creditable results.

Courier's
founding
editor
retires
The founding Editor-in-Chief of the
Unesco Courier, Mr. S. M. Koffler (see
photo) retired at the end of 1976.
During his thirty years with the maga¬
zine, he tirelessly applied his enthu¬
siasm and professional skill to the task
of opening its "window on the world",
in the service of Unesco's ideals of
international understanding, the struggle
against racism and all forms of preju¬
dice and the preservation of the natural
and cultural heritage of mankind.
Thanks to his efforts, the Unesco Courier
has become an incomparable interna¬
tional monthly magazine, familiarizing
its countless readers and friends
throughout the world with the aims and
activities of the United Nations Educa¬
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organi¬
zation. The Director-General of Unesco
has appointed Mr. René Caloz, former
Assistant Editor-in-Chief, as Mr Kof-
fler's successor.
Journalists discuss
mass media
at Unesco meeting
Journalists from five continents, includ¬
ing newspaper editors, directors of news
agencies, and radio and television
executives attended an international
symposium on the free flow of infor¬
mation in Florence (Italy) from 18 to 20
April 1977. A major topic at the sym¬
posium, organized by Unesco with the
co-operation of the Florence Office of
Tourism, was how to improve the flow
of information from the developing
countries to the industrialized world.
Weather and water
"Weather and Water" was the theme for
this year's World Meteorological Day
(23 March). The theme, reflecting the
important role of national meteorological
and hydrological services in water
management, was particularly appro¬
priate, since the United Nations Water
Conference was meeting at the same
time (14 to 25 March) in Mar del Plata
(Argentina) to examine the state of the
world's water resources.
Unesco's latest guide
to world translations
The latest (26th) edition of Index Trans¬
lationum, Unesco's annual international
bibliography of translations, shows that
the Bible remains the world's most fre¬
quently translated book. In 1973, the
year covered by the Index, 304 new
versions appeared throughout the world.
Lenin, with 336 translations, regained
the place lost to Marx and Engels in
1972 as the world's most translated
author.. In lighter vein, Agatha Christie
(157) outstripped Georges Simenon
(128). Other widely translated authors
included Jules Verne (154 versions),
Tolstoy (127), Shakespeare (94) and
Hemingway (80). The Federal Republic
of Germany published more new transla¬
tions than any other country (6,462),
followed by Spain, with 4,468. . In
third place is the U. S. S. R. (4,400),
followed by Japan (2,284), Italy (2,083),
the U.S.A. and Finland (1,966 each).
Of nearly 47,000 new translations listed,
the largest group is literature (26,677
titles), which comes well ahead of law,
social sciences and education (5,962),
applied sciences (3,984) and history,
geography and biography ¡3,552).
Japan's $ 60 million
contribution to U.N. University
Japan has made a third payment of
$ 20 million to the endowment fund of
the United Nations University, bringing
its total contribution to $ 60 million.
The central objective of the Tokyo-based
University, which has no single campus,
is to promote the growth of academic
communities throughout the world,
especially in developing countries. Se¬
nior staff of the University, which is
sponsored jointly by the U. N. and

READ ALL ABOUT IT !
Much of the news which appears each day in the world
press is collected and transmitted to the newspapers
by news agencies. Today, 90 countries have agencies
of their own, but 40 countries still have none. The
international scene is dominated by five giant news
agencies from four of the world's most
industrialized countries. This has led to a "one-way"
flow of information, whose persistence is a subject
of widespread concern.
Drawing G Françoise Jacquelin, Paris
