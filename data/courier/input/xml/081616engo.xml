VOLUME III-No II
GEORGIE BERNARD SHAW : July 26, 1856-November 2, 1950
THIS issue of the"Courier"is dedicated to the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, adopted December 10, 1948. It is also the first to appear
since the death of George Bernard Shaw, at the age of 94. The relation
between one of humanity's noblest documents and the life and work of one
of history's literary giants is certainly complex and certainly controversial,
but-just as certainly-it exists. We merely note that Shaw is the man who
said :
"All improvement is founded on tolerance..."
"Religion is the only real motive force in the world ; but what you fellows
don't understand is that you must get a man through his own religion and
not through yours..."
"A day's work is a day's work, neither more nor less, and the man who
does it needs a day's sustenance, a night's repose, and due leisure, whether he
be painter or ploughman."
What Shaw called"the incident of death"came to him after a life in
which he said :
"This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself
as a mighty one ; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the
scrap heap ; the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod
of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself
to making you happy."
Shaw wrote in English and his works were read in Arabic, Spanish, Italian,
French, Polish, German and Russian ; Turkish and Chinese ; Hindi, Bengali,
Urdu, Gudjerati, Tamil and Punjabi and many others. In all of those lan-
guages, men and women will have their own way of saying what Shaw said
of a departed friend :
"It's too bad of him to do this."

UNESCO COURIER-Page 2 DECEMBER 1950
UNESCO'S Executive Board, meet-
ing in Paris, last month, unan-
imously re-affirmed that the
Organization, within its field of
competence, will give all possible as-
sistance to the action of the United
Nations in Korea, and authorized
Mr. Jaime Torres Bodet, the Director-
General, to continue to participate in
this action, including the work of the
United Nations Specialized Agences,
who may be called upon to frame a
long-term reconstruction plan for
Korea.
The Board authorized Mr. Torres
Bodet to incur the expenditures in-
volved in giving effect to this pro-
gramme and to furnish, at the request
of the United Nations, such services,
advice and any other types of aid as
may be required by the Unified Com-
mand or any United Nations mission
in Korea.
The Board at its previous meeting
had approved the opening of an initial
credit of $ n5, 000 for the re-establish-
ment of teaching in Korea and for an
educational programme specifically de-
signed to make known the work of the
United Nations and the principles of
collective security.
The Director-General, in his report
to the Board, made reference to
Unesco's support of United Nations
action in Korea.
Educational experts are collaborat-
ing on special pamphlets which will be
published in three editions-English,
French and Spanish. Different pam-
phlets will be issued to three separate
age-groups : 1) secondary school ;
2) university students ; 3) adult educ-
ation classes.
"ONE WORLD"MAP
THE Bureau of Current Affairs inLondon has drafted two projects
for school wall charts accom-
panied by explanatory leaflets. The
first is a world map on a projection
designed to show the idea of a united
world ; the second is a graphic repre-
sentation of the problems of maintain-
ing peace and the ways in which
various specialized agencies of the
United Nations are striving to promote
conditions favourable to peace. These
maps are flexible in design and can be
adapted not only to educational needs
and to methods of teaching in dif-
ferent countries, but also to changes
in world conditions and events.
In response to the Executive Board's
appeal to Member States, to National
Commissions and to non-governmental
organizations, Unesco has received
numerous indications of support.
The Swedish government and the
Swedish Committee for Unesco broad-
cast the Board's appeal to arouse pub-
lic interest and to obtain assistance
and contributions to the action of
Unesco on behalf of the Koreans.
INTERN TONAL
"WHELPING HANDS"
AMONG the non-governmental in-ternational organizations which
responded to the Board's appeal,
the Boy Scouts International Bureau
announced that it will endeavour to
re-establish its Korean branch which
was very active before hostilities.
The International Congresses of
Modern Architecture expressed its
wish to collaborate with Unesco and
will provide a list of the most qualified
architects in Japan for the work of
reconstruction. This organization has
also declared its willingness to help
Unesco in all general matters that
pertain to Korean aid.
The International Union of the Ca-
tholic Women's Leagues has asked its
various organizations to help the civ-
ilian population of Korea.
The World Organization for Early
Childhood Education proposed to
provide both material aid, in the form
of educational material, toys, etc., and
technical aid in the form of expert
advice on teaching, school reconstruc-
tion, training of teachers, etc. Its
various national committees have been
notified and a request has been made
to send in all data and suggestions
that might help the Koreans. This
organization has also authorized a
Korean specialist in pre-school educa-
tion to furnish a report on the edu-
cational needs of his country.
The Director-General, in his report
to the Board painted a vivid picture
of the state of teaching in Korea and
its history.
Educational problems, he declared,

co activities, in Frankfort, last month.
Germany thus becomes the first non-
member state of Unesco to set up a
representative group whose composition
and functions compare with those of
the National Commissions formed in
member states of the Organization.
A) though the German Committee wiìl
not have the official international sta-
tus of a National Commission, it will
neverthe) ess be able to contribute effec-
tively towards the achievement of Unes-
co's aims. and its work will be watched
with interests in other countries.
The UNESCO COURIER is an international periodical devoted to the work
of UNESCO and to activities and developments throughout the world in edu-
cation, science and culture.

* Under negotiation.
The sixty members of the Committee
include prominent men and women and
representatives of organizations in the
fields of education, SCience and culture,
representatives from the federal and
state governments and from women's
organizations and trade unions. A simi-
lar committee for \\'estern Berlin was
also set up last month.
Three International Centres
THE constitution of the new GermanCommittee, whose pr sident is
Professor Erbe, Rector of the Uni-
versity of Tubingen, pledges its mem-
bers-representatives of all the large
and influential German organizations-
to work towards the accomplishment of
L'nesco's aims.
Amok/ the projects for Germany,which Unesco has prepared for i951,
are the setting up of three international
centres-for the Social Sciences, four
youth activities, and for pedagogical
work. The newly formed German Com-
mittee should be able to give substan-
tial help in co-ordinating the work of
the three centres.
1t is planned to finance the project
by contributions from private and pu-
blic funds in Unesco member states-
outside normal Unesco budget contribu-
tions-as well as from German sources.
The first contribution for this work has
already been made by the Lebanon.
The international character of the
three institutes will be reflected in the
choice of staff, the composition'of the
governing bodies and in the types of
problems with which they will deal.
Their activities will include the organi-
zation of studies, conferences, exhibi-
tions and seminars and they will work
particularly to help German youth in
overcoming the manv problems facing it
today.
will probably be as difficult as any
others that the Republic of Korea and
the United Nations will be called upon
to solve, but a solution must be found
if this country is to return to its
normal way of life and continue its
development. Present-day teaching in
Korea is the result of forty years of
Japanese rule. It was planned so that
no more than a few fortunate Koreans
could continue advanced studies or
receive training as teachers ; while
major benefits were provided for the
Japanese who were living either tem-
porarily or permanently in Korea.
SCHOOL SYSTEM
RYE-ORGANIZED
IN 1945, when the Allied militarygovernment took control of educa-
tion, Japanese was the only lang-
uage spoken in the schools ; the
administrative personnel, the college
heads, the principal teachers and
inspectors were, almost without ex-
ception, of Japanese nationality.
The military government, during
its four years control of Southern
Korea instituted various radical
educational experts and adopted by the
government of South Korea only a few
months before hostilities broke out.
Since 1945, the percentage of the
national budget devoted to education
has increased from 3. 6% to nearly 10% ;
the number of children attending
primary schools has risen from ap-
proximately one million and a half to
two millions and a half, and the num-
ber of pupils attending secondary
schools, from 62, 000 to 225, 000.
Upon the outbreak of hostilities,
there was a serious lack of teachers
and qualified administrative personnel,
the number of teachers available for
training being quite insufficient ; books,
particularly books in Korean, were in
very short supply, since almost all the
printing works were in North Korea.
Mr. Torres Bodet emphasized that
the havoc and destruction of the
present war have probably destroyed
all the progress made during the last
five years and that the Korean Repu-
blic, unaided, would be in no position
to re-organize its system of teaching,
least of all to develop or improve it.
One thing is clear, he pointed out,
that only an action undertaken on a
large-scale by the United Nations can
help the Koreans to restore their
educational life.
NINETEEN NATIONS SIGN'
UNESCO-SPONSORED TRADE
PACT AT LAKE SUCCESS
t s this issue of the Courier
went to press, 19 nations
had signed the Unesco-
sponsored agreement removing
customs barriers to the move-
ment of books, newspapers and
a wide range of educational and
scientific materials across their
borders.
These signatures were obtain-
ed at Lake Success on November
22, when the pact Iwas opened
for signature.
The agreement will promote
"a better understanding anct HiM-
tual I'espect between states,"said
r. N. Secretary-General Trygve
Lie.
THE MAKING OF THE
FIRST PEACE PIPE
MM HE Couher recency received a pho-tograph of the drawing reproduced
here from Miss Clarice Johnstone,
Lady Principal of Nelson Girls'College,
Nelson, New Zealand.
Miss Johnstone wrote :"Early this year
you published an Indian Folk Tale,'The
Making of the First Peace Pipe'. I used
this in a peace talk to the girls of my Col-
lege on Anzac Day, April 25th. The story
inspired one of them, Angela Grace
(16 years) to attempt a'black and white'
illustration. As you published the story
which, incidently, made a deep impres-
sion, I wondered whether you would care
to print the picture in the Courier."
The story published in the Courier was
one of a series-'Children's Stories for
Peace"-collected from all parts of the
world by Unesco's Radio Division. Its
theme was that the best way to settle dis-
putes is to sit down and talk things over.
The drawing made by Angela Grace is
an appropriate illustration for the message
of United Nations Day this year-"There
Shall Be Peace"-and is reproduced here
in the hope of promoting just such feelings
as the young artist has so well expressed.

"The Start of a Great Mission"
Extracts from an address delive-
red by M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco, on the
occasion of the fifth anniversary
of the proclamation of the Unesco
Charter, on November 6.
UNESCO is five years old today,
and I have asked you to join
with Us in celebrating the
anniversary..
In a human life, the first five
years reach only early childhood. In
historical time, they are but a brief
episode. Yet for Unesco, they have
been the start of a great mission, the
beginning of a task which affects
millions of men not only throughout
their lives but unto the lives of their
children and their descendants yet
unborn. And it has been with faith
and determination that we have
made a contribution, which we hope
will be lasting, to the progress of
the world.
Ignorance was our first and great-
est enemy. Even now, millions of
illiterates still make up a majority
of the world's population. To con-
quer mutual misunderstanding by
spreading knowledge was and still is
our major battle.
We sought the lessons of ex-
perience. Thus the pilot project of
the Marbial Valley in the island of
Haiti was launched. Hope seemed
banished from this valley : poverty,
illness, ignorance reigned there. But
now schools, hospitals and local in-
dustries have been created, and
among the inhabitants the will to live
has replaced resignation to fate.
And the experience permitted us
to work out and apply a tried and
tested technique applicable else-
where.
To Remove Mutual ignorance
HOWEVER, at another stage of the
evolution of the problems, mu-
tual tolerance and mutual res-
pect among men depend upon the
removal of mutual ignorance ; and
the first step is providing opportun-
ities for the meeting of those who
are or who will be their intellectual
guides. Thus We have fostered the
creation of study groups or seminars
which from time to time bring
together or into relationship with one
another either teachers or the re-
presentatives of all metal activities.
On the same plane of ideas, we
have drawn up under the title
"Study Abroad"an international
directory of scholarships and ex-
changes of persons. And on a
higher plane, in order to make
available universally the advantages
of research everywhere, we have set
up in various parts of the world six
regional centres of scientific research,
which regularly exchange the results
of their work.
But in order that the life of the
mind might become a link leading to
the universal fraternity which is our
aim, we also had to make sure that
no prejudice would at the very start
contradict this hope. Therefore, last
July, the most eminent biologists, so-
ciologists and geneticians, brought
together by Unesco, solemnly affirm-
ed that"racial discrimination has no
scientific foundation in biological
fact."The welcome given to this
proclamation of equality was univer-
sal.
MIND, alas remains dependentupon matter, and when condi-
tions of existence are too bad,
it is vain to advise men to educate
themselves. We cannot close our eyes
to certain of these conditions of exis-
tence, and we must undertake to
change them even while we, at the
same time, make knowledge accessi-
ble. That is why we have participat-
ed, to the extent of our competency
and our means, in the great plan of
technical assistance to which the
United Nations is denoting
$ 20. 000. 000.
In this connexion, we are sending
to countries whose governments re-
quest them missions of experts to
teach the techniques which lead to
improvement of the material and
moral condition of the disinherited. I
shall mention as examples of our
work in this field only the activities
of our representatives in India and
Ecuador, and call attention to the
fact that twelve other countries have
already asked our help.
A Door To The Future
THE perspectives which I havet just shown you are not inusoru.
I have merely lifted a corner of
the veil that hides the future. These
ideas have already taken on subs-
tance.
Indeed, our last General Con-
ference adopted a resolution which,
I hope, will open a door to the future.
Here it is :"The General Conference
resolves that the Director-General
be authorized to develop over and
beyond the regular programme of
Unesco certain extraordinary pro-
jects capable of making a large-scale
contribution to world peace and se-
curity, in the hope that such major
projects might become of such
consequence as to warrant special
financing from sources outside the
regular budget."
On the basis of this resolution, we
got to work and, profiting from the
experience we have acquired, we
elaborated a big project which puts
into effect the fundamental ideas
which I have set forth to you.
This project was given preliminary
approval by our Executive Board
which has just finished its meeting.
It will be submitted for final
approval to our General Conference
which will meet in Paris next year.
(Details of this world-wide fun-
damental education project are
given elsewhere on this page).
At the end of this road which we
are tracing and in which others will
follow after us, there is the immense
hope that exists in every man, in
every family, in every nation, the
hope that men's reason and in-
telligence, finally mature and en-
lightened, will be able to transform
into reality-peace among men.
THE appointment of Dr. John W.
Tailor, President of the Univer-
- L sity of Louisville, Kentucky, in
the United States, as Deputy
Director-General of Unesco was
announced last month by M. Jaime
Torres Bodet, Director-General of the
Organization.
Dr. Taylor, who will take up his
duties with Unesco on January 1, 1951,
replaces Dr. Walter H. C. Laves, who
left the Organization last June.
Dr. Taylor, a distinguished Ameri-
can educator, who was born in Co-
vington, Kentucky, in 1906, has had
wide international experience. He
spent six years in Europe, between
1925 and 1937. In addition to Co-
lumbia University, New York City,
where he obtained the degree of Doc-
tor of Philosophy, he studied at the
Universities of Paris, London, Berlin
and Vienna.
His career as a teacher included
posts at Teachers College and New
College, Columbia University ; Louisia-
na State University ; and the Kaiser
Friedrich Realgymnasium. B e r 1 i n-
Neukolln. He was also director
of foreign study at Columbia. He has
been awarded the United States Le-
gion of Merit and the French Legion
of Honour.
Pioneer Work In Community
Education
DO. TAYLOR has been President ofthe University of Louisville since
1947. Under his administration,
the University was the first in any of
Dr. JOHN W. TAYLOR
the American southern states to sup-
press the racial barrier to the admis-
sion of students. Negro students were
admitted to the graduate and profes-
sional schools of the University ; and
under-graduate students will also be
accepted at the end of the present
academic session.
Under Dr. Taylor's guidance, the
University has carried out important
pioneer work in the field of com-
munity educational development, and
adult education in.'Neighbourhood
Colleges". This included the establ-
ishment, in co-operation with the
Louisville public school system and
public library, of a radio station which
broadcasts educational and cultural
programmes for general and class-
room listeners. Subsequently, the Uni-
versity Theatre of the Air was created
in co-operation with a major national
broadcasting company. Six other
American universities joined with
Louisville in a network linked with
150 radio broadcasting and television
stations in various parts of the United
States.
KOREA AND THE UNITED NATIONS
THE history of the United Nations Security Council's debates and
action in the Korean question during the period Tune 25 to Septem-
ber 7 has now been retold in"Korea and the United Nations"recent.
ly published by the U. N. Department of Public Information..
This publication gives an overall picture of United Nations action in
support of collective security as it was described in articles which appeared
each fortnight in the United Nations Bulletin.
A S 20, 000, 000 plan, to be carried out
by progressive stages over a
period of 12 years, for the
creation of a world network of
Fundamental Education Centres (1)
was approved by Unesco's Executive
Board last month.
The plan is part of a worldwide
drive against illiteracy and low living
standards. It calls for the establish-
ment of a network of six regional
centres in five of the areas of the world
where Unesco's Member States are
seeking help in their efforts to eradi-
cate illiteracy.
This scheme, which is to be financed
by private and government funds out-
side Unesco's regular budget, will be
submitted to the Organization's
General Conference for final adoption
next summer.
The centres are to be established in
Equatorial Africa, Latin America, the
Far East, India and the Middle East.
For the benefit of the countries of each
region, they will carry out :
Fundamental Education classes (above)
were organised in the Marbiat VaUey, on
tbe'island of Haiti, as \part ot a pilot pro-
ject launched by Unesco. Hope seemed
banished from this valley : poverty, illness,
ignorance reigned there. Now, schools.
hospitals and local industries have been
created, and among the inhabitants the will
to live has replaced resignation to late."
1 Research to determine the real needs'of the area and exp rim ntation into
new methods and media of fundamental
education suited to these needs.
2 Training In each centre of 100 spe-cialists, teachers and field workers for
a year, or a total of 5, 400 specialists In
the six centres by the end of 12 years.
3 production of locally adapted teachingmaterials, including literacy texts,
reading matter, guides to teachers and field
workers, filmstrips and f) ims, and radio
recordings.
4 Mobile misslona of experts to go intothe fields to help local governments t
apply the techniques involved, and the
materials produced, to their literacy
campaigns.
"Training By Chain Reaction"
THE centres have been conceivednot merely as training schools or
production units but as nuclei of
experimentation. One of the novel
features of the Unesco scheme has
been referred to as"training by chain
reaction". A large proportion of the
5. 400 specialists, who will have been
trained in fundamental education me-
thods at the end of 12 years, will
return to their countries in teams to
establish national or local training
centres ; thus the number of trained
personnel resulting directly or indi-
rectly from the work of the regional
centres will be multiplied through
the establishment of these branch
agencies.
Of the six centres, one will be spe-
cially equipped with a field unit for
the production of model educational
films. Another will be set up to
provide special research and training
in the production of radio programmes
for fundamental education.
The Unesco scheme for setting up
the fundamental education centres
will make a positive contribution to
the vast plan of Technical Assistance
for Economic Development recently
launched by the United Nations and
its Agencies. It will make available
specialists trained in new educational
methods and the tools needed to con-
vey to the masses of people in these
areas the rudimentary knowledge and
skills without which they cannot
achieve a higher standard of living.
(1) Fundamental Education is a tef"
coined by Unesco to describc M'at kind o/
minimlllll and generat education which
aims at the preparation of ehild/'CII and
adults deprived of propcr sclwoling for a
better participation in thc economic and
social progress oj lheÍ1' community and of
mankind as a whole.

UNESCO COUtUER-P 4 DECEMBER 1950
ON 9 December 1948, in Paris, the
General Assembly of the United
Nations unanimously approved
a Convention on Genocide,
under which the nations solemnly
undertook to prevent and punish the
crime of genocide, whether committee
in time of peace or war.
The following are the three main
articles, in which genocide and the
actions incurring international penal-
ties are described :
* Article II. Genocide means any of
the following acts committed with intent
to destroy, in whole or in part. a natio-
nal, ethnical, racial or religious group
of human beings :
(a) killing members of the group :
(b) causing serious bodily or mental
harm to members of the group :
(c) deliberately inflicting on the
group conditions of life calculated to
bring about its physical destruction in
whole or in part ;
(d) imposing measures intended to
prevent births within the group :
(e) forcibly transferring children of
the group to another group.
Article 1C. The following acts shall
be punishable :
(a) genocide :
(b) conspiracy to commit genocide :
(c) direct and public incitement to
commit genocide ;
(d) attempt to commit genocide ;'
(e) complicity in genocide.
Article IV. Persons commiting geno-
cide or any of the other acts enume-
rated in Article In shall be punished,
whether they are constitutionally res-
ponsible rulers, public officials or pri-
vate individuals. *
A Courageous Proclamation
THERE are two extreme views onthe subj ct of this Convention.
Some regard it as a praiseworthy
but ineffective gesture-a mere ideo-
logical"pointer"-serving no other
purpose than to indicate the lines of
future reforms and of future institu-
tions to be established.
Others see in it a most courageous
proclamation of the primacy of inter-
national morality over individual
sovereignty.
Holders of the first view maintain
that, by refusing to include political
minorities in the groups to be protect-
ed against extermination, the Assem-
bly failed to carry out the essence of
its task. They also affirm that the
mention of an"international penal
tribunal", which is not yet in being,
strengthens the impression of futility
created by the Convention. Its value
is, this school says, confined to the
ethical sphere. It is only the expres-
sion of a desired aim and not an
achievement.
Holders of a more positive view
attack such criticism as being symp-
tomatic of the permanently sceptical
attitude of those who under-estimate
the dynamic value of principles and
written instruments. They recall that,
at the outset, neither the 1789 Decla-
ration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen, nor the Communist Manifesto
of 1848, nor the United Nations
Charter itself were anything but
documents enshrining principles. Yet
who can be blind to the growth of
concrete achievements from these
documents ?
A document of this type will be of
historic value if men translate its aims
into action. In the meantime, the
great importance of the Genocide
Convention is that it has been una-
nimously agreed to by 55 countries
which in other matters are gravely
ON January 12, the United Nations Convention on the Prevention andPunishment of the Crime of Genocide-the deliberate mass extinction
of human groups-will come into force, having been ratified or acceded
to by over 20 countries.
The Convention will give legal effect to important principles of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights for it can be linked not to one, but to many of the
Declaration's articles ; such articles, for example, as the one which enjoins men to
act to one another in a spirit of brotherhood, that which provides for equality of
treatment for all peoples, that which guarantees for all men the right to life, liberty
and security of person, that which prohibits torture, cruel or inhuman treatment
and a number of others.
The Convention on Genocide, therefore, fits well into the great task undertaken
by the United Nations to ensure basic human rights and freedoms to every human
being and to establish a world rule of law.
divided. It places legally in the
wrong any persons who try to repeat
the experiment of systematically exter-
minating an entire group of human
beings.
Examples of the extermination of
whole populations-a town, a tribe or
or a sect-are only too frequent in
history. In the earliest times, the
victor doubtless often found it more
convenient, and safer, simply to anni-
hilate the vanquished. Periods re-
corded by history on the other hand,
if carefully studied, show that the
result of a victory was more often the
subjection than the total extermin-
ation of the defeated party.
Conquering empires were more con-
cerned to increase their wealth and
the number of their subjects and
slaves than to make deserts of the
lands they had overrun. Alexander,
Caesar, and even Attila, sought first
and foremost to collect allies and
vassals ; and Caesar, when there was
a revolt against him, sold the rebels as
slaves. Only when the subject peoples
were permanently rebellious were the
"guilty"massacred.
With the growth of fanatical reli-
gious passions, like that inspired by
Islam in its first period of expansion,
or by the Christianity of the Cru-
sades, it became a general practice to
exterminate"infldels". This practice
was adopted not only by lawless

of human beings were slaughtered on such

and worked to death- were organized on
a scale large enough to accomplish the
plan of exterminating or permanently weaken-
ing entire racial and national groups of

bodies of the victims (above). Only the

policy, by princes and religious author-
ities themselves.
Thy earlier massacrings of rebels,
from the time of the slaughter of the
Albigenses and of the victims of
Saint Bartholomew's Night in France
up to that of the pogroms in Eastern
Europe and the killing of the Arme-
nians, were due to blind fanaticism or
pitiless policy. But it is only in our
own days that we find cold-blooded,
systematic, total extermination, on a
scale never before practised.
Crimes Against Humanity
THE number of men, women andchildren-manly Jews and Chi -
eye-done to death by order of
the German and Japanese authorities
has been officially put at 12, 000, 000 (1).
After the victory of the United Na-
tions, the principal war criminals re-
ceived the punishment that was de-
manded by outraged public opinion
the world over. But the legal appa-
ratus set in motion to deal with these
"crimes against humanity"was more
than a mere expression of the world's
anger. What was new was the solemn
statement that henceforth there were
certain acts that could be excused
neither by necessities of war nor by
the plea that they were carried out
as a result of formal orders received.
In future there would be a human law
overriding any instructions issued by
national authorities, and individuals
no less than heads of States would
have to answer for any atrocities com-
mitted.
This innovation of capital import-
ance establishes the duty of refusing
obedience on grounds of loyalty to the
elementary principles of humanity.
It is part of a tremendous movement
in contemporary thought in the di-
rection of restoring the primacy of
personal rights which were introduced
two centuries ago by the founders of
modern democracy, but which con-
siderations of collective efficiency and
achievement of the maximum"results"
had gradually destroyed. The Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights,
adopted on 10 December 1948 by the
General Assembly of the United
Nations, is one of the signs of this
rehabilitation of the essential princi-
ples of all civilized society.
Crusader Against Genocide

petent to deal with crimes com-
mitted during the war. They refused

to deal with the flagrant persecution
that took place before 1939, when the
totalitarian regimes were extending
their power. Yet the danger of so-
called"undesirable"minorities being
exterminated is almost as menacing in
time of peace as in time of war. It
was intolerable that acts of this type
should be protected by the institution
of national sovereignty, and that the
civilized world should continue to have
no legal remedy against atrocities that
regimes subject to no control might be
tempter to commit.
A certain man decided to vindicate
the idea of setting up some inter-
national legal authority to punish and,
more important, to prevent such acts
of total extermination, no matter when
committed or attempted. Ever since
1933, Professor Lemkin, of Yale Uni-
versity, a Pole by origin who was a
legal adviser at the Nuremberg trials,
had devoted himself to th1s cause. To
him we owe the term genocide,
meaning the killing of persons who
have committed no other crime than
to belong to a given race or group of
human beings. Thanks to the grue-
some revelations of 1945, he finally
achieved his aim.
At the General Assembly of the
United Nations in 1946, the delegates
of Panama, India and Cuba agreed to
move a resolution against genocide.
This resolution has been, and is,
respected by the overwhelming major-
ity of States. It has on occasion, as
we know, been violated. But in the
period from 1919 to 1939 international
obligations were respected by 60
sovereign states, and violated by
only 3. This small minority was suc-
cessful, for the time being, in evading
their obligations only because the
penalties prescribed for such action
were not applied. More recent hap-
penings, however, show that to-day
the United Nations are less tolerant
towards breakers of undertakings.
And perhaps it is not altogether vain
to hope that, should the crime of
genocide threaten to re-appear, the
governments and peoples will succeed
in using the clear and stringent terms
of the Convention to prevent any
fresh essays in mass extermination.
Thus not only the"good pleasure"of
princes, but also that of States, has
had to yield ground in favour of the
rights of the human person and,
indeed, of the rights of Law.

Message From
M. Jaime TORRES BODET
Di rector-General
Of UNESCO
T. wo years ago the General
Assembly of the United
. Vations, meeting in Paris,
adopted the Universal
Declaralion of Human Rights.
Can we say that the existence
of the Declaration has in any way
changed our mode of life during
these two years ? Some people
will point out regretfully that it
has not presented breaches of
the law, nor the resort to
violence, nor the stagnation of
certain political and social con-
ditions. Undoubtedly, the criti-
cism is justified. But is it
reasonable to expect that any
Declaration, however nobly ins-
pired, could at once solve all
problems ?
The main role of the Declar-
ation is, in fact, to help all men
foresee a future toward which
the governments can guide their
activities In a common endeavour.
If at times the cruel irony of
events makes us doubt the sin-
cerity o {the Declaration as a
splendid affirmation of princi-
ples. let us not forget that it
provides the basis of the concrete
activities already undertaken by
the United Nations on behalf
Human Rights. Let us bear in
mind that it has played a part in
the judgment of not a few courts
of law; ; and that inevitably its
influence on morals and opi-
nions, already great, will be
more and more directly felt, even
in the field of law-making.
Human Rights Covenant
THE United Nations is now
. working on an Interna.'ional
Covenant of Human Riqhts
which, unlike the Declaration,
will have binding force on all the
signatories. This Covenant will
be the first document of uni-
versal scope to establish a com-
mon pattern the attitude o/
States toward private citizens.
Naturally, therefore, its import-
ance will be enormous. But we
should not be led by this fact to
forget the great value inherent in
the Universal Declaration o/
Human Rights.
There are, no doubt, some peo-
ple who may be tempted to be-
lieve that the Declaration should
have begun with a strict de/i-
nition of the minimum commit-
ments which states should and
could undertake, instead of with
an affirmation of principles.
But, had this minimum been
fixed, the states might have con-
tented themselves merely with
showing the boundaries beyond
which barbarism could not pass.
A proclamation of the ideals
which clearly and positively
e, establish the frontiers of civiliz-
ation might have been postponed
until a remote future..
Chart For The Future
FOR example, would a simpleagreement on commitments
have included articles on
social security, on the right to
education and culture ; and
would it have given the coer-
cive force ? How many countries
would have been able to under-
take such commitments ? Let us
not forget that all nations have
noi reached the same stage o/
economic development, nor have
they all the same cultural and
social traditions,
Let us bear in mind, too, that
this Declara ! ion, which charts so
bright a future for mankind, was
adopted on tlte morrow of atro-
cities whose barbarism awakened
our generation from its mood of
complacency, To proclaim hu-
man Rights was to propose a
positive civilization; it was to
affirm that mankind has enough
confidence In such a civilization
to overcome the difficulties in its
path, and to survive.

"DECLA-
RATION

THE
CAUSE
OF HUMAN RIGHTS"
IAM very happy to have thisopportunity to say that I feel
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights has already helped
us to progress in the observance of
human rights in many parts of the
world. Both the Constitution of
India and that of Indonesia bear
the stamp of acceptance of these
rights and there are an increasing
number of people who refer to the
Declaration in their speeches and
even though it is not a legally
binding document, it has been
referred to in court decisions.
I realise that it will take some
time for the education on the real
meaning of human rights and res-
pect for the human personality to
he accepted In the same way
throughout the world, but I cannot
help feeling that we have already
moved ahead a long way.
There is much more to do and
nobody can afford not to be
concerned about the future work on
human rights and the actual change
in human nature which must take
place before these rights are fully
implemented, but we have made a
beginning and I believe we are
moving forward.

RIGHTS
MESSAGE
A NEW FORCE"
F ROM the very beginning of theFrench R volution in 1789
when the Declaration of the
Rights of Man and the Citizen was
proclaimed, not only the liberties of
French nationals were defined, but
those of every person in every
nation of the world.
Its message was universal and
overcame alt frontiers.
Though widely circulated and
rousing the deepest interest among
all peoples during that period of
almost fanatical fervour, it was not
until a century and a half later-
150 years of continual sacrifice-
that'this appeal on behalf of Man
and his liberties became trulv
universal
The United Nations gave the
message a new force. Their
Declaration, now two years old,
not only reaffirms the rights of all
the members of the human family
hut clearly states, in the light of
all the trials and warring of nations
and men, the conditions of human
dignity on all social levels and the
most noble aims of twentieth
century civilization,
As long as these rights and these
liberties are accorded universal
respect, the peoples will be freed
from war, ignorance, fear and
misery. In other words, the
nations who have solemnh reco-
gnised these rights and liberties,
have no greater nor more urgent
task than to ensure that they
become living, sincere and effective
realties.
M. VINCENT AURIOL
President of the French Republic.
IN a world.which is full
of conflict
and hatred ann
violence, it be-
comes even
more necessary than al any other
time for us to have some anchor
to our faith in human destiny.
The solemn proclamation by the
United Nations of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
provides such an anchorage, if
only we hold on to it. I welcome,
therefore, the celebration of the
second anniversary of this Declar-
ation and I hope that it will
revive in peoples'minds all over
the world that there are certain
positive values in life which we
must respect and hold on to, if life
is to be made worth living. The
present may be bad, but the present
passes, giving place to the future.
If the future we work for is full
of hope for humanity, then the ills
of the present do not matter much
and we have a justification for
working for that future.
So I welcome this anniversary of
an event important in man's history
and I send greeting to all those who
work for the realisation of those
human rights which we have
proclaimed.

Prime Minister of India.
"THE
WORLD
HAS NOW
SPOKEN"
FEWnow content
the opinion
that the Univer-
sal Declaration of Human Rights is
one of the historic documents of
our epoch. Already in scores of
significant international as well as
national encounters it has been
appealed to in authoritative justifi-
cation of certain causes or com-
plaints. A growing body of
jurisprudence is building up
around it. As an objective standard,
the Declaration serves at once as
a potent ferment of ideas, as a
disturber and judge of actual
practice, and as a solid ground to
which movements of reform can
anchor themselves.
That organized humanity was
able after three years of responsible
debate to arrive at this impressive
definition of what belongs to man
as man, without a single opposing
voice in the final voting, was a
tremendous event. The world has
now. formally spoken for the first
time a to'what constitutes the
proper digility and worth of man.
For the thoughtful student, the
debates that attended the elabora-
tion of the Declaration would
prove perhaps more important than
the Declaration itself. It was in
these debates that the dialectic of
idea and attitude among the
effective cultures of the present
world became manifest.
The present elaboration of the
Covenant, the next stage beyond the
Declaration, is meeting with some
difficulty. But no matter how
much the nations, whether
understandably or not, fight shy
of a strong binding Covenant, the
Declaration, which has already
been debated and decided on bv
them. will forever serve as a
goading reminder of the ideals to
which they have alreadv solemnly
pledged themselves.

"THE FREEDOMS
FOR
WHICH
WE
STAND "
NOW, whenit is more
than even
necessary to def-
end those freedoms or which we,
in the community of the United
Nations stand, we welcome the
opportunity which is given in these
columns of the Unesco Courier to
re-affirm our belief in the Declar
ation of Human Rights on this
second anniversary of its signature.
MR. GEORGE TOMLINSON
Minister of Education
for England and Wales.
"FOR
AN
OPEN
WORLD"
IN the Univer-s a I Declar-
action of
Human Rights
aspirations are set forth which
unite all humanity in spite of the
deep-rooted divergencies which
exist in the world to-day as to how
common ideals can best be realized.
In order that these divergencies
"hall not prevent the fulfilment of
the hopes embodied in the estab-
lishment of the United Nations
Organization, it appears most
urgent that efforts be undertaken
from all sides to encourage a free
exchange of information and ideas
between nations without which
co-operation in true confidence
cannot be achieved.
In an Open Letter of June 9th,
J 950, to the United Nations, dealing
with the challenge to civilization
presented by modern developmenls
of science and technology I have
tried to stress this point, and at
the present occasion I would like
to quote the following passages :
"An open world where each
nation can assert itself solely by
the extent to which it can contri-
bute to the common culture and is
able to help others with experience
and resources must be the goal to
be put above everything else. Still,
example in such respects can be
effective only if isolation is
abandoned and free discussion of
cultural and social developments
permitted across all boundaries.
"Within any community it is
only possible for the citizens to
strive together for common welfare
on a basis of public knowledge of
the general conditions in the
country. Likewise, real co-opera-
tion between nations on problems of
common concern pre-supposes free
access to all information of im-
portance for their relations. Any
argument fo/'upholding barriers
for information and intercourse,
based on concern for national
ideals or interests, must be
weighed against tlie beneficial
effects of common enlightenment
and the relieved tension resultiny
from openness.
"In the search for a harmonious
relationship between the life of the
individual and the organization of
the the community, there have always
been and will ever remain many
problems to ponder and principles
for which to strive. However, to
make it possible for nations to
benefit from the experience of
others and to avoid mutual
misunderstanding of intentions,
free access to information and
unhampered opportunity for ex-
change of ideas must be granted
everywhere.

UNESCO EXHIBITION-ALBUM 1
UNENDING FIGHT TO GAl
Human rights, as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration adopted by the United Nations GeneralAssembly on December I 0, 1948, are the outcome of a struggle that has been going on since
the dawn of history. The scope of the Declaration's thirty articles cannot therefore be
properly understood without some knowledge of the great efforts and sacrifices they reflect.
As part of its collective campaign of education and information aimed at showing both chil-
dren and adults the help they can derive from the Rights and the corresponding duties they must
fulfil in return, Unesco is publishing and will distribute a special Human Rights exhibition-album.
On these pages, the Courier is reproducing a few of the album's 276 illustrations which depict
'struggles and victories in the history of human rights as well as brief extracts from an accom-
panying 40-page booklet from which teachers can supply the historical background that throws
light on the meaning, circumstances and scope of the events to which the illustrations refer.
The illustration. and corresponding texts, which are taken from the Human Rights Exhibition
organized by Unesco in Paris last year, have been selected so as to form miniature reproduc-
ticn of large sections of this exhibition.
Nearly 12, 000 copies of the album are being published. A number of these are being sent to
Unesco Member States and National Commissions for use in schools, libraries and adult education
centres. Other copies will be obtainable from the Unesco Sales Agents, listed on page 2 of this
issue, as from next January, priced at S3, or 16/-or 800 French francs.
THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY
AT the beginning of the nineteenth cen-tury slavery was still a basic institu-
tion in a number of great and other-
wise highly civilized countries. In 1835 it
flourished in the colonies of all the great
European countries, and in North and
South America. Immense economic inte-
rests and a complete social system were
based on it. The supporters of abolition
were treated as dangerous Utopians, when
they were not prosecuted and punished as
criminals.
Yet within half a century slavery was
everywhere abolished.
The history of the abolition, in a rela-
tively short space of time, shows that an
idea which is apparently Utopian but is
basically true can be speedily translated
into fact when men who are at once cou-
rageous and discerning will take a hand
in public affairs. It is on this that the
authors of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights have based their reasoned
hopes.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT
VERYONE has the right to Freedomof movement and residence within
the borders of each State.
"Everyone has the right to leave many
country, including his own, and to return
to his cotftttry."
So states Article 13 of the Universal De-
claration. Like many other articles, it
lays down principles that, though readily
acknowledged in theory, are far from
being put into practice everywhere. It
might even be said that, in the twentieth
century, freedom of movement has suffer-
ed a setback, despite the tremendous de-
velopment of the material facilities of
transport from one part of the globe to
another.
It would seem that the first fourteen
years of the twentieth century marked the
apex of man's freedom of movement on
earth. Not only were time, cost and in-
security then reduced to a minimum, but
the obstacles placed in the way of travel-
lers by States had almost entirely vanish-
ed. In 1913 one could travel without a
passport in all Europe, with the exception
of Russia and Turkey.
But after the 1914-1918 war, human
obstacles to freedom of movement increas-
ed ; passports, formalities and restrictions
reappeared. The New World was partially
closed to immigrants. After the 1939-1945
war, difficulties became general, and were
added to by financial regulations. Today,
despite marked improvements in aircraft
and automobiles, the delightful freedom of
movement of 1913 is no more than a
memory.
Freedom of movement is a perfect
example of a principle that men are at
one in proclaiming but render nugatory in
practice. Only international agreement
based on firm, clear-cut undertakings, will
suffice to remove, for the benefit of the
majority, the present obstacles which
profit scarcely anyone.
THE ABOLITION
OF INHUMAN TREATMENT
THE revival of torture on a vast scale, inour own times and i  countries pos-
sessing a high degree of culture, proves
that our advances in civilization are not
too sure, and that constant vigilance, aid-
ed by clearly defined laws and the means
to see that they are enforced, is the only
way of preventing nations from returning,
with terrifying ease, to the worst practices
of the dark ages.
Article 5 of the Universal Declaration is
short and categorical in this matter :
"No one shall be sUbjected to torture
or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treat-
ment or punishment."
The history of the world is only too full
of examples or atrocious tortures applied
to punish actions, beliefs, or utterances
that today we regard as harmless, legiti-
mate or even, on occasion, praiseworthy. It
is remarkable that so many great men
should have suffered torture in the name
of some law that now seems absurd to us :
Savonarola, Macchiavelli and so many
others, not counting innumerable"here-
tics"and"witches"who were simply burn-
ed alive, from Joan of Arc and John Huss
in the fifteenth, Michel Servet and Gior-
dano Bruno in the sixteenth, to the
"witches"of New England in the seven-
teenth centuries.
It was by a slow, very slow process,
that civilized humanity finally abandoned
these practices.
PROTECTION AGAINST
ARBITRARY ARREST ;
EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW
A brief examination of ancient lawsand custo s will reveal the state of
personal insecurity and social injus-
tice in which our fathers lived. The con-
quest of the rights of the person is a mo-
dern enterprise, far from complete and
constantly threatened with setbacks. The
progress so far made, however, justifies
the further efforts that are incumbent on
the men and nations of today.
THE DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF MAN
is one of the world's historic human rights'docu-
ments. Produced during the first summer of the
French Revolution, it maintained that men are
born free and equal, and proclaimed freedom of
speech, security and defence against oppression.
It was one of the chief sources of inspiration to
other peoples also struggling to achieve freedom.
established institution, disappear from
English, French, Russian and American
soil within a quarter of a century <1838-
1865). It may be that, in another twenty-
five years, nothing Utopian will be seen in
Article 25 of the 1948 Declaration :
"Everyone has the right to a standard Of
living adequate for the health and welL'
being of himself and of his family, includ-
ing food, clothing, housing and 7TU ? dical
care and necessary social services, and the
right to security in the event of unem-
ployment, sickness, disability, widowhood,
old age or other lack of livelihood in cir-
cumstances beyond his control."
During the last hundred years, nume-
rous laws have improved the living con-
ditions of the less favoured classes
throughout the world. Hospitals have
been modernized, and social welfare enter-
prises have increased. The world has be-
come accustomed to the idea that a nation
is fully responsible for the lot of each of
its citizens, no less than to the democratic
principle that each citizen must assume
some responsibility in public affairs.
THE PROTECTION
OF FAMILY LIFE
AND OF PROPERTY
A s the idea of the rights of the perso,, :has developed, rights that we now
regard a true criterion of civilization,
the status of women and children has
evolved in the direction of an ever greater
freedom to determine their own fate.
Legal or customary restrictions, which in
early times were very severe, are tending
to disappear.. 
This development is illustrated by ArtiJ.
FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. For a long period, widely separated civilizations developed in isolation,
unaware of each others existence. During the Renaissance, the discovery of America, commemorated
in this engraving (above), and the first voyages round the world brought these different civilizations into
contact. In the 20th century, freedom of movement has suffered a setback due to"human"obstacles :
passport visas, formalities and restrictions. Only international agreement can remove, for the benefit
of the majority, such obstacles.
In contrast with the brutal and unjust
practices that still subsist in many parts
of the world, we may quote the following
passages from the New Constitution of
India which is now in force, and frees all
citizens from the fear of arbitrary arrest
and wrongful interference at the hands
of the State :
"The people of India, solemnly resolved
to constitute India as a sovereign and
democratic Republic, undertake to gua-
rantee to all its citizen :
-" Social, economic and political justice ;
"Freedom of thought, expression,'opi-
non, faith and worship ;
"equality before the law and access to all
rights ; it further undertakes to promote
. among all men
"Fraternity, which ensures the dignity
of the individual and the unity of the
nation."
These words show us how far the fun-
damental ideas as to human rights have
progressed throughout the world.
THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR,
AND SOCIAL SECURITY
UNTIL a very short time ago, no matterhow much suffering or inequality
was caused by unemployment, differ-
ences in wealth, the misuse of power,
or other circumstances, it was generally
considered that each man had to"shift
for himself"to find work, and protect his
interests as best he could. It was only
when faced with the new economic and so-
cial conditions of the nineteenth century
that legislators were forced to acknow-
ledge that, where labour was concerned,
the absence of regulations led to new privi-
leges, fresh oppression, and an increasing
risk of disturbances and violence. In other
words, the task of freeing the human per-
son remained unfinished so long as the
fundamental principles formulated for
citizens in general had not been legally
applied to the protection of the worker as
such. To put it more briefly still, what
good were theoretical freedom and equa-
lity, if the only choice open to a man was
"misery or revolt" ?
The progress achieved, or still to be
achieved, in this matter follows logically
upon the civil and political progress made
during the last 150 years. It has been made
possible only by the establishment of un-
restricted universal suffrage, which is an
application of-the basic democratic princi-
ple of equality. This conquest of universal
suffrage has been largely due to the con-
stant and strenuous efforts of labour orga-
nizations themselves.
STANDARD OF LIVING,
AND ASSISTANCE
CERTAIN articles, the more daring, of theUniversal Declaration of Human
Rights have impelled many people to
exclaim :"But this is Utopian ! Unfortu-
nately, the world hasn't reached that
stage !"
True, the world has not yet reached
that stage. But the world is in process
of evolution, and that evolution depends
on men. We have seen slavery, a well-
cle 16 of the Universal Declaration of 1948,
which states that"men and women... with-
out any limitation due to race, natio7Uilit :'
or religion, have the right to marry and t
found a family. they are entitled to eqid.
rights.., Marriage shall be entered into
only with the free and. full consent of the
intending spouses."
To us, there is nothing revolutionary in
these stipulations ; but they would have
seemed so in the past. The novels and,
plays of the seventeenth and eighteenth
century alone show us the lengths to
which family and social tyranny could
proceed in such matters..
The notion of property, one of the ideas
most hotly discussed in our day, is dealt
with in Article 17 of the Declaration of
Human Rights, at least in a negative form :
"No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of
his property."
In former times a prince simply confis-
cated the property of some of his sUbject&., ;
as Louis XIV did in the case of the Pro :'&gt;
testants. In modern times, many a new
régime has done as much with the pro-
perty of individuals or social groups that
have fallen from power ; Hitler, for inst-
ance, confiscated the property of Jews. It
will always be difficult to draw the lin !
between arbitrary spoliation on the on
hand and legal expropriation (if the put.
blic interest demands it) accompanied buzz
fair compensation, on the other.
In the last resort, only the conscience\
of citizens can and must determine when
a legal act becomes an abuse of power. If
may even be said that this distinctio !
denotes the difference between a true an
a false democracy. f
THE EMANCIPATION
OF WOMEN \
THE story of women's rights is a fas-cina ing ne. Th y have been subject,
throughout history, to extraordinary
vicissitudes.
There have been periods of total eman
cipation, and periods of enslavemen'
beyond all hope of deliverance. Some
times men have placed women in a posi-
tion of eminence ; at other times, women
have had to win their own rights at the
cost of a long struggle against the dis-
trust, fear and derision of their contempo
raries. In Ancient Egypt, woman, thougt
for a time enslaved to man, very soot.
attained complete equality with him.
In Ancient Greece, especially with the
Boeotians and the Spartans, society long
adhered to the primitive law that regard-
ed women as veritable beasts of burden.
The great Renaissance, which began at
early as the twelfth century in Mediter-
ranean countries, was accompanied by a
great advance in women's emancipation.
We cannot recount the history of wo-
men's emancipation as it developed in
every country, but most nations have re-
cognized the principle of equal rights to !
both sexes. There is therefore nothing ir,
the Universal Declaration of 1948 that if
revolutionary nor Utopian, as would have
been the case fifty years ago. It simpl ;
lays down, for the whole world, principle
that have been established by different :
civilizations after centuries of effort ane
the gradual elimination of many injustice ; [ ;.

o SHOW MAN'S
J HIS RIGHTS
FREEDOM OF RELIGION
THE right to freedom of conscience andreligion is an achievement of modern
times. This right has conflicted less
with material interests than with deep
and traditional beliefs. From time im-
memorial, men convinced that they possess
the truth have thought it their duty to
impose it, by law or by force, on other
men whose idea of the truth was different,
and those who serve one god have called
those who serve another god"infidels."
It was to the eighteenth century,
essentially the century of the emancip-
ation of the human person, that fell the
honour of fighting religious intolerance
unremittingly and defeating it almost
everywhere, at least legally.
The 1948 Universal Declaration of
Rights was not content, in its Article 18,
merely to reassert the individual's right
to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion, and his right to freedom to
change his religion or belief. It explicit-
ly added"freedom, either alone or in
community with others and in public or
private, to manifest his religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observ-
ance."
We should not however forget that, if
the spirit of persecution is declining in the
matter of religious beliefs, it has never
been more aggressive in the political and
the social sphere. In various places in
this respect, the final conquest of the
rights of the human person in our world
of today, is far from having been
achieved.
that it is a sign of strength in authorities
to grant all citizens a wide measure of
freedom of discussion and that to suppresfj
that freedom is a sign of fear and there-
fore of weakness, Article 19 of the 1948
Declaration will readily find its place in
national legal systems.
THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION
THE right of every human being toeducation is, of all the rights affirmed
by the United Nations Declaration of
1948, one of the least contested.
Article 26, which deals with the right
to education, was adopted unanimously
with two abstentions. The terms of the
article are couched in no uncertain lan-
guage, although nations and families are
given all reasonable freedom in inter-
preting it : elementary education must be
free and compulsory, technical and profes-
sional education must be made generally
available, and higher education must be
equally accessible to all, on the basis of
merit.
This is the culmination of a century
and a half of effort made in almost all
countries with a view to a truly demo-
cratic distribution of education. A
hundred years ago the idea of making
education accessible to all appeared, to
many, to be dangerously Utopian.
In our times, whole continents, where
lower standard of living seemed insepar-
able from an equally low standard of
education are now adopting popular
education, accessible to all. This, as Jef-
ferson said, is essential to any democratic
régime based on popular endorsement.
FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
AND OPINION
AT all periods, the progress of civiliz-ation has been retarded by lack of
freedom in the dissemination of
ideas and opinions. An idea cannot be
killed by censorship or prohibition, but its
advance can long be delayed. For whole
centuries, intellectual life and social pro-
gress have been checked and sometimes
paralysed by the concerted will of
churches and princes, closely united to
maintain a status quo favourable to their
privileges. The invention of printing in
the fifteenth century placed a formidable
weapon in the hands of innovators and
reformers, whose resources increased with
the spread of pamphlets and, later, pe-
riodicals.
While with the press, the film and the
radio there has been an increase in the
means of propagating ideas, the means of
controlling and checking this propagation
have also become much more refined. In
the past, authorities were, in a way,
powerless against ideas communicated
from man to man. Today, great news-
papers are more vulnerable than were the
slim pamphlets of the past, and the polic-
ing of frontiers has everywhere become
far more effective.
There is no doubt that, in certain parts
of the world, freedom of information is
in retrogression. On the other hand it is
noteworthy that the new Republic of
India has through its Constituent Assem-
bly proclaimed the right to freedom of
speech and expression for all its citizens.
When it comes to be generally admitted
PARTICIPATION
IN CULTURAL LIFE
THE right to education is completed bythat to"participate freely in th  curl-
tural life of the community", a right
stated in Article 27 of the Universal De-
claration of 1948. Works of art and the
benefits of scientific progress should be
accessible to all. It would be difficult, in
this regard, to lay down strict laws,
applicable in all cases and to all persons.
But what the Declaration seeks to estab-
lish is quite clear. It is equally clear what
it seeks to prevent-that cultural life
should be made the privilege of certain
groups ; that material or financial obsta-
cles should come between a work of art
and men of good will who wish to
approach it ; and that the results of
scientific progress should be monopolized
for the profit or enjoyment of a few.
At all periods, culture has been demo-
cratic in some of its manifestations, e. g.
games and athletic competitions, popular
songs and dances, and performances at
which the people were at once spectators
and actors.
But the outstanding cultural feature of
modern times is the diffusion of the
printed word. Gutenberg's invention (of
which the Chinese were the forerunners)
greatly increased the individual's oppor-
tunities of acquiring culture without
depending upon collective manifestations.
Books are not expensive, and this has
made the personal conquest of knowledge
possible, without reliance on the rather
exclusive schools of the past. Books have
been the great liberators of modern man.
WHEN HUMAN RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED. Under Hitler's rule in Germany, human rights were syste-
matically violated, all individual liberty was suppressed and all questions affecting morality, human rights
and human dignity, were subordinated to the lust for power of a so-called"master race". Aggressive
diplomacy soon led to war. Frontiers were violated, provinces annexed, peoples enslaved. Nearly all
nations were involved in the conflict. The war took a total of forty million lives-the civilian victims of
mass murder in concentration camps (above, right), and the soldiers who left their homes to fight and die
(above, leftrso that enslaved countries might be liberated.
FREEDOM OF CREATIVE WORK
ARTICLE 27 of the Universal Declarationof 1948, which deals with the right
of everyone to participate in cultural
life, also mentions everyone's right to"the
protection oj the moral and 11Ul. terial in-
terests"resulting from"any scientijic,
literary or artistic production or which he
is the author".
The application of this principle is ob-
viously less extensive than that of the
rights of all readers, listeners or specta-
tors, I. e. everyone as a whole. Here, only
the actual creators, writers, artists or
scientists, are concerned. But their pro-
tection means the defence of all civiliz-
ation, and thus, indirectly, everyone pro-
fits by it.
The creator, as a man, must enjoy to
the full those rights that belong to all,
including the right to choose his place
of residence and his occupation, and to
be guaranteed a standard of living that
ensures his dignity (Articles 13, 23, 24 and
25) ; thus protected, it is for him alone to
bring his available thought and effort to
bear upon the work he has chosen. The
less the rest of mankind intervenes in
this choice, the sounder and purer this
choice will be.
The better a civilization understands the
place occupied in its destiny by thinkers
and artists, the greater the number of
recognized creators there will be, and the
greater will be the facilities offered them.
THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE
IN GOVERNMENT
THE civic rights of the individual under-lie all other rights, because they Jnake
it possible to obtain those other rights
peacefully.
They also guarantee them against the
arbitrary action of authority.
This is stated by the 1948 Universal
Declaration in its Article 21, which is of
fundamental importance :
"Everyone has the right to take part in
the government or his country, directly
or through jreely chosen representatives.
"Everyone has the right oj equal access
to public service in his country.
"The will oj the'people shall be the
basis oj the authority of government ; this
will shall be expressed in periodic and
genuine elections which shall be by uni-
versal and equal sufjrage and shall be
held by secret vote or by equivalent free
voting procedure."
One hears in these words the echo of
principles affirmed at the end of the
eighteenth century, at the time of the
American and French Revolution, prin-
ciples underlying the national constitu-
tions of all democratic countries, that is,
the majority of modern nations. The
peoples now know what it costs to be
deprived of such rights ; it 4s to be hoped
that the cruel and disastrous experiment
of the twentieth-century dictatorships
will not too soon be forgotten.
*
WE have seen that the Universal De-claration of Human Rights, adopted
by the Third General Assembly of
the United Nations, sets a milestone of
progress in two respects.
First, it lays obligations upon forty-
eight countries, whose official representat-
ives approved it. If it leads to an inter-
national Covenant,'the position bf
hesitant States will become iIDore and
more difficult to justify and to maintain.
Second, the Declaration courageously
states certain ideas that are only of recent
origin ; as regards these, it has shown that
the world was further forward than many
people imagined.
Still one justifiable question must be
answered :"So much lor rights, but what
about duties ?"
The answer is simply that the De-
claration of Human Rights tacitly in-
cludes a complete Declaration of Human
Duties ; there is, indeed, no right that does
not imply a duty for others to respect and
defend it. And all the duties are foreseen
and defined by the recognition of the
rights of others.
Many of these duties, admittedly, are
negative :"Thou shalt not deprive others
of their liberty,""Thou shalt not per-
secute others on account of their. opinion :'
"Thou shalt not arbitrarily exploit the
work of others."But what a progress it
would be, in this world of ours, if all men
practised their negative duties !
If and when the rights of the individual
are fully applied, every man will be faced
by a supreme responsibility, that of direct-
ing his own fate. He will have lost but
one right, that of regarding himself as a
helpless victim in a world where freedom
of decision does not belong to him. There
are still men who prefer irresponsibility,
and have proved it. All men are not yet
ready for so full a measure of liberation,
but their children will become accustomed
to it.
tv ABOLITION OF INHUMAN PRACT ! CES. Vengeance first regarded
1, as a right to be freely exercised by the individual, was later replaced. bypublic vengeance. The law of an ye for an eye and a tooth for
'. a tooth was the source of much cruelty in the penal system and
, poison conditions, as Illustrated In this 17th century engraving of a
cell in the Pastille. Reformers have succeeded in driving home
'he idea that prison IS not enough ; a criminal needs re-educating.
THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATION IN CULTURAL LIFE. Books
are a link between man and man for they enable people to share
in the whole cultural heritage of mankind. In ancient times libraries
were rare and only the priveleged had access to them. Today,
travelling libraries like this Canadian one (above) make regular trips,
bringing books within reach of those who live far from cities.
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE. The attainment of Universal Suffrage for
men and the elimination of property requirements for the right to vote
was a long and difficult process. The struggle was only half won,
however, until the right to vote could also be extended to the other
half of humanity-women. The victory was only generally achieved
during our own century. Japanese women (above) obtained this
right after the Second World War.

TO PROPAGATE A UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
THE good fight to gain and defend human rights calls for the full powers

the man or woman who shouts the truth from the housetops, the mega-

throat for future use and multiplying the voice a millionfold. The man who
expresses truth with pen or paintbrush is not baffled by the use to make of
typewriters, printing presses or cinema cameras. Now the motion picture.
which speaks so powerfully to the mind and heart, is increasingly devoted to
the heroic themes of human rights.. Along with nobly conceived commercial

ANNIVERSARY OF THE
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
OF HUMAN RIGHTS
Message from M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco
(Continued from Pay 5)
THE Declaration charts a long andhard road. It is significant that
it uphold. side by side, civil
rights, political rights, social and cur.
tural rights, for in'practice there can
be no separation among them. Does a
people have political freedom if it can-
not gather the profits of a prosperous
industry and agriculture ? Can a people
develop its economy and improve its
social (organtzatton if its children
remain illiterate, and its resources of
leadership inadequate ? The domain
of Human Rights is indivisible. It is
the whole problem of the improvement
of the lot of human beings that calls
us to action.
Noone can any longer be tempted to
complacency by the illusion of security
and of uniformity. One people may
seem to enjoy most of the rights set
forth in the Declaration. But can such
a people really have the rights if its
neighbours lack them ? Can it be sure
of keeping them if it fails to take an
active part in the common struggle four
the recognition of the rights of all peo.
ple ! ? There is no human event which
does not affect the whole world. No
one can live outside history ; and the
history of our time is the crisis of man-
kind in the throes of achieving its mate-
rial and moral unity-of mankind
which will know neither peace nor re6-
pite until man's elementary aspiration
to the universal recognition of his dig-
nity is satisfied.
A Hope Drives Man Forward
WHEN we live in a time fraught
 2cith so many dangers and face
a future full of so many new
perspectives ; when it is so plain that
man will find his salvation only by
subordinating to his ideal of justice the
prodigious conquests that nolC threaten
to dominate him, how can our clarity o/
intelligence yield to the temptation of
discouragement ? The proclamation of
Human Rights takes up. the cry of the
victims, of the enslaved, of the hungry
and the workless ; it reveals the pre-
sence in man of a hope that drives him
forward on a path where rest would
be the accomplice of death. No doubt,
the centuries before ours were wrong
to believe that uninterrupted progress
would be easy. Mankind does not
advance without setbacks, without re-
treats, without grave crises. No doubt,
we pay dearly for the power given tv
man, for the achievements of technique
the increase of wealth, the attainmen :
br all peoples of self-determination, the
birth oj a real human community ; but
ij we succeed in solving the problems
that beset us, we shall be able to build
upon them a civilization at long last
truly Universal.
The Leat'en Of Universality
THus an apPt'al which bursts fromthe very heart of reality calls us
to this struggle. Let us conduct
ourselves in a way that will make every
body share in the struggle ; let us create
a militant state of mind throughout the
world. Let us enlighten men's con-
science. Let us speak to men of their
rights, and also of the duties which will
make them worthy to enjoy the rights.
Let us show them that no selfish claim
is enough, that the conquest of rights is
a struggle in the name of all men and
carries within itself the leaven of uni-
versality. Above all, let us teach them
the ugliness of injustice, of violence alld
of oppression. Let us tell them that
these dangers threaten us more then
ever ; but that also more than ever it
depends upon man, and only upon man,
to defeat them and gradually to estab-
lish an order u ; hich fulfils our aspira-
tions in conformity with the circum-
stances of our epoch. We shall then
have played our part in the achievement
of that ideal which is made the more
glorious by the obstacles it must over-
come ; and in hastening the advent of
a policy in which peace and progress
are inseparably linked-
above were chosen from two such films. (1) The United Nations film"Of
Human Rights", for example, shows how lack oi tolerance can cause open
hostility among the children of a small town. Living on opposite sides of a
river, two groups had previously regarded each other as"different"and
carried on a traditional"war". At left, editor of the local newspaper acts as
peacemaker between them and tells them about the Universal Declaration oí
Human Rights. (2)"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate
for the health and well-being oi himseli and his family..." (Article 25, Universal
Declaration of Human Rights)."Au Carrefour de la Vie" (The Crossroads of
Life), a film produced for the United Nations by Henri Storck, shows how bad
living conditions become the root cause of juvenile delinquency.
UNESCO FILMSTRIPS AID WORLD-WIDE
TEACHING OF HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES
To help propagate the principles of the human rights, Unesco has produced
and is distributing a series of six filmstrips on themes suggested by the
United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for use in schools and
in adult education.
The first.. Vilestones, Is a general study of the historical development of the
concept of human rights and each of the other tlve-Abolition of SlaL'ery, Eman.
cipation of n'omen, Freedom of Thought, The Right to Education, and Arts and
Life-decals with a single article in the Universal Declaration.
Cnesco is distributing them with explanatory notes In English, French. Spanish,
arabic and German. These include practical instructions in the use of fiimstrips,
a copy of the Preamble to the Universal Declaration and a sentence or paragraph
of explanatory exposition tinned with each of the thirty visual frames of each of
the six filmstrips.
Six hundred prints of each filmstrip have been made and are being distri-
Imted to Unesco Member States, Lnesco National Commissions and to Ministries of
Education or other Government departments. Additional copies, obtainable from
Unesco. cost $3, U or 1, 000 French francs for a set of six, while individual film-
strips are available for 50 cents, 3/G or 200 francs. Next year jt is planned to
supplement the series with li1les dealing with other. aspr'l'ts of 1111111an rlghf$.
THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY, bracts
from a Unesco filmstrip : 1. Conditions on a
slave trading ship were appalling. For every
negro torn from his native place who arrived
safely at his journey's el1d, four died because
of maltreatment. 2. Slaves had no rights.
They were sold by auction in the slave market.
Their owners had the power of life and death
over them. 3. Whether the slave was to be
well or ill-treated depended entirely on his
owner.
FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION. Extracts
from a Unesco filmstrip : 1. The invention of
the printing press in the 15th century was one
of the most important developments in the
communication of ideas. 2. The seizure and
destruction of the press of"le Temps"was
one of the causes of the Revolution of 1830
which ended the Bourbon dynasty in France.
3. In our own time, the Nazi regime in Germany
revived the burning of"dangerous"books as
a measure of repression.

<![CDATA[
DECEMBER 1950 Paae 9-UNESCO COURIER
OF the 30 Articles in theUniversal Declaration
of Human Rights,
several are concerned in
various degrees with the
freedom of science. Dr. Bart
J. Bok, Associate Director of
the Harvard College Obser-
vatory and former Chairman
of the U. S. National Research
Council's Committee on
Unesco, has examined this
question in a pamphlet
"Freedom of Science", pu-
blished in French by Unesco
and shortly to appear in
English.
In this pamphlet, Dr. Bok
points out that scientists are
especially conscious of their
rights and freedoms. For
example, the scientist in his
laboratory desires freedom
in the selection of research
topics and wants guidance
rather than orders. He
should have access to the
publications of other workers
in the field and he should
have the right to publish
freely the results of his own
investigations. He wants to
have no restrictions upon his
freedom of travel and of
correspondence.
Further, scientists want to
exercise their rights as free
citizens ; they should be free
to participate in the cultural
and intellectual life of the
community, and to parti-
cipate in government and, if
necessary, to criticize it.
"The community which
restricts the freedom of its
scientists as citizens will louse
in the end. In modern
society, government at all
levels is constantly faced with
policy decisions involving
complex scientific and tech-
nological matters. Wise de-
cisions must rest, in part, on
the advice of citric-minded
citizens, and useful advice
wilt hardly be forthcoming if
scientists are not free to
exercise their civic responsi-
biHties", declares Dr. Bok.
A TASK FOR ALL MEN
IN discussing how the free-om of science can be
preserved, he says that
scientists must be made to
realize that their freedom
can only be retained if they
are willing to react against
all infringements of this
freedom."They must learn
to take no freedom for
granted... scientists cannot
accomplish this task alone.
They need sympathetic
support from non-scientists
in all walks of life and in all
professions. The freedom of
science. cannot be maintained
unless there is, in world
opinion, a climate favorable
to it."
Dr. Bok refers specifically
to Articles 12, 13 and 19 of
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (protection
against arbitrary interference
and attacks, freedom of
movement and freedom of
opinion) which he states are
the minimum that must be
guaranteed if there is to be a
freedom of communication.
If a scientist is to work
effectively, he needs as much
as anyone the rights ex-
pressed in Articles 20 to 26.
These include : freedom of
assembly, the right to take
part in the government of his
country, to social security, to
free choice of employment, to
rest and leisure, to an ade-
quate standard of living and
to education.
Article 27 (participation in
cultural life and protection of
scientific, literary or artistic
productions) is especially
important for the scientist.
But, says Dr. Bok, referring
to Article 29 (Everyone has
duties to the community...),
these rights and freedoms
are meaningless, unless they
entail certain duties and res-
ponsibilities.
A GUARANTEE
FOR FREEDOMS
D. Bok recognizes thatscientists can b  consi-
dered as prototypes of
world citizens but that inter-
HOW ELECTRONS MOVE
THROUGH A WIRE. A cur-
rent of electricity passing through
a wire may be compared with a
number of boulders rolling down-
hill through a forest. The trees
represent the atoms in the metal
of the wire, and the boulders are
electrons which are continually
bumping into them, then moving
on again. So tiny is an electron
that several millions of millions
pass through an ordinary electric
lamp each second.
nationalism in science is at
present subject to many con-
trols. He comments that
scientists know from every-
day experience how close we
are to.. one world"of science
and they have, therefore, a
special responsibility to work
for the removal of all un-
necessary barriers.
He refers also to a Charter
for Scientists prepared by the
Committee on Science and its
Social Relations (CSSR) of
the International Council of
Scientific Unions, drafted in
1948. There has been much
discussion about this but k
can see tremendous gains iï
individual scientists in suffi-
cient numbers were to decid (>
simultaneously and volunta-
rily to attach their signature
to the Charter.
Dr. Bok expresses the ups..
nion that :
"As long as science is free,
scientists are almost automa-
tically joined in a world bro-
therhood and it is fervently
hoped that the scientists of
the world will realise that in
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights lies the pro-
mise of a guarantee for thetr
cherished. freedoms and that
it is their responsibility to
join the forces that must lead
in achieving the universal
adr'YJtion of the Declaration.
A CLOCK FOR THE ATOMIC AGE. In a radical departure from all
conventional methods of measuring time, an atomic clock-invariant with

been developed by the National Bureau of Standards in Washington. Based
on a constant, natural vibration frequency of atoms in the ammonia molecule,
the atomic clock is a scientific achievement which offers an entirely new
primary standard of frequency and time. Its principiepromises to free man from
age-old methods of fixing time by the daily rotation of the earth on its axis,. was it revolves around the sun. The primary standard, the earth, is very
gradually slowing down and, in addition, unaccountable fluctuations in the
rate of rotation have sporadically lengthened and shortened the day. The
new method offers an invariant master clock against which the variation in
timekeeping of the earth could be measured. This photo shows Dr. E. U.
Condon, Director of the National Bureau of Standards, (left) and Dr. Harold
Lyons, inventor of the clock, in front of the panels which control it. Dr.
Condon is holding a model of the ammonia molecule whose absorption of
radio energy provides the invariant frequency upon which the principle
of the clock is based.

WHAT ARE ELECTRONS ?
, by Ira M. Freeman
ONE of mankind's most ver-
satile and obedient helpers
in the world of practical
affairs turns out to be the lightest
particle of matter known to
science-the electron. Within a
few decades of its discovery it
succeeded In claiming as its own
an astonishing number and variety
of tasks, giving rise to an entirely
new art called electronics.
Electrons attain their greatest
usefulness when freed from
matter and made to ßlng them-
selves through a void inside a
g-iass tune. This they do in
various forms of apparatus. In
the photocell the liberation comes
through the gentle caress oaf'a ray
of Mfrht ; In the. X-ray tube and
in the. radio tube (or valve),
electrons are literally boiled out
of a hot wire.
Thomas Edison, the American
inventor, observed the latter effect
as long ago as 1883, but it went
almost unnoticed, and twenty
years passed before Sir John
Fleming-fashioned a practical
device on this principle. Shortly
thereafter. Lee Deforest na-
tented the radio tube in what is
essentially its modern form.
Today it Is difficult to name any
of the sciences or practical arts
that has not found use for this
device.
The first indications of the
existence of electron were obtain-
ed after the middle of the last
century when clever experimenters
found it possible to coax subtle
"radiant matter"from ordinarv
substal1l'es by passing current
f !"Om a spark coil through a fiats
tube from which most of the
hindering atr had been pumped.
The decisive experiments that
revealed the nature of this"radiant-matter" (more conven-
f. iunally called cathode rays i
were the work of the mild-
mannered and gifted English phy-
sicist John Joseph Thomson. He
found what others had looked for
without success-that the cathode
rays could be swerved from their
normally straight path by means
of electrical and mag-netic forces.
Bending Cathode Rays
F 110M 1 he observed directionand mount of the bending
Thomson concluded that
the cathode rays consisted of
charges of negative electrical
carried by particles of matter.
The astonishing ; feature of the
result was that such a particle
turned out to be almost two
thousand times less massive than
an atom of hydrogen-up to
that time the lightest known bit
of matter. Thus, in ;,
science came to know that
something-even simpler than the
supposedly immutable atom exist-
ed in Nature.
Thomson's experiment by itself
was not capable of disclosing the
amount of electricity carried by
each cathode ray particle, or
electron. but in his laboratOl'y anti
elsewhere investigators set about
to devise new experiments to
determine this quantity.
Among the many scientists who
worried about the problem was
a young professor at the Uni-
versity of Chicago, Robert 1Ililli-
kan. He devised, in 1909, an
apparatus in which all is sprayed
into the space bet-
ween two Hat metal
plates and a single
drop is kept under
observation in a mi-
croscope. Such a

suspended motionless, or even to
begin to move upward. The
reason is that the process of
spraying the oil has wrenched
electrons loose from some of
the atoms and given the excess
to others. As a consequence,
a drop will generally possess a
resultant electric charge, either
positive or negative, and so will
be urged upward or downward by
the electrical force existing bet-
ween the charged metal plates.
Atomicity Of Electricity

From the observations it was
possible to compute the amount
of electrical charge residing on
each droplet, with the significant
result that these charges in-
variably are whole-number mul-
tiples of a certain smallest valuP
- the so-called charge on the
electron. Mitiikan's experiment
showed, then, that electricity,
like matter, possesses a kind of
atomicity, and that the electron is
the basic smallest unit of electro-
Hcation-that can exist by itself.
This speck of"radiant matter"
discovered Buy Thomson, this
parUcte carrying'a dab of electri-
city, turns out to be one of the
fundamental constituents of the
atoms of all kinds of matter
throughout the universe.
Just before the war, the
American scientist, G. R. Harrison
wrote :"Putting electrons to
work has put men to work. That

other highly important applica-
tions might be added to thè above

tiny yet mighty electron are
seemingly without end.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 10 DECEMBER 1950
IN THE SERVICE OF PEACE :
Andre HONNORAT
(1S68-1950)
by Georges. FRADIER
P AHISIA : \"S in the early twentieswere somewhat loath to
take their visitors on a tour
01 the city's southern borders. A
muddy street was all that separ-
ated the pleasant"pare Montsou-
ris"from the dismantled forti-
fications where, amidst rubble
and debris, the vacant lots of
suburbia aimlessly awaited the
speculators and their blocks of
tenement houses. Beyond, midst
the smoke and dirt of factories,
lay the"red belt"as Parisians
called it, a mass of corrugated
iron or tarred makeshift hotels,
sunk in the pitiless depths of
misery.
To this barren waste a man
sometimes came to ponder, a
distinguished-looking man whom
passers-by took to be an architect
or a poet. In point of fact he was
the Minister of Education. Yet
the passers-by were not mistaken,
for André Honnorat was both a
poet and a builder. He used to
wander through the brambles and
the rubble, a tall figure under the
heavy skies. His gaze seemed to
miss the ruins and the hovels ;
in their stead he saw a spacious
city, with buildings bordering on
tree-lined avenues, on wide sports
grounds. Down these avenues,
through the broad gateways, came
groups of young men and women,
laughing, talking together in
every known tongue.
An Instrument Of Peace
This was And ; ;-é Honnorat's dream :a city planned e tirely for stu-
dents, the pupils of the world's
most cosmopolitan school-the Uni-
versity of Paris. Striding over the for-
tifications with a friend, the Minister
was no longer a mere dreamer ; he
became a prophet : Honnorat could
almost count the students and mapped
his"cily"down to the last detail.
In the centre, he planned to baild
an International House, and a vast
Hall-Library to replace the humble
loth century church, traditional
meeting-place of the"nations"of
Paris University, which the mediae-
val students in their poverty had
dedicated to Saint Julian the Pauper.
The thousand year old Sorbonne
never failed to arouse the Minister's
enthusiam : his first gesture upon
taking office had been to restore
to the University the autonomy which
Napoleon had abolished. The Sor-
bonne of which he dreamed was more
than a seat of learning and research,
it was to become an instrument of
peace. The future of peace... the idea
obsessed Honnorat ; he dwelt upon it
in all his speeches, at every meeting :"Do yoM beHece that all the problems
which war has brought before the
human conscience can really be solv-
ed by Government action alone ? Is
not the best solution to teach the
peoples to understand each other ;
and to teach such understanding,
what better way can be found than
to bring the élite of the younger
generation into contact with one
another ?"
Enthusiasm Stimulated
Friends And Benefactors
FOR the general public the Ministerof Education was little more than
a respected politician. His career
was fairly typical of that of many
French public servants. Coming of a
poor family, he had started life as a
journalist and later had been secretary
to several ministers. For forty years
he represented his native"départe-
ment", the mountainous Basses-Alpes,
first in the Chamber and later in the
Senate. Yet his friends knew Honno-
rat to be an extraordinary man. He
was simple, loyal, sincere. These
LA CITE UNIVERSITAIRE, as André Honnorat visualized it and as it exists today : a city
planned entirely for students, the pupils of the world's most cosmopolitan school-the
University of Paris. Key to plan : 1. Administrative Building. 2. Medical Building.
3. International House. 4. United States Foundation. 5. Belgian Students House. 6. National
Institute of Agronomy Foundation. 7. japanese House. 8. Danish Students House. 9. Swiss
Foundation. 10. Swedish Students House. 11. College 01 Spain. 12. Franco-British Foun-
dation 13. Argentine Students House. 14. Canadian Students House. 15. E. and L. Deutsch
de la Meurthe Foundation. 16. Monaco Foundation. 17. French Provinces House. 18. Arme-
nian Students House. 19. Dutch College. 20. Indo-Chinese Students House. 21. Cuban
House. 22. Greek Foundation. 23, Sports Field.
qualities alone would probably not
have distinguished him. But the
nobility of his character, the warmth
of his human sympathy and his power
of vision were truly exceptional.
This creative imagination, which of
all human gifts is perhaps the most
rare, might have been enough in itself
to account for the statesman's extra-
ordinary achievements. A University
City in the heart of the"red belt" !
The very idea dismayed"serious"
people. Yet, in the space of a few
years, the dream was to come true.
By 1925, the now famous"found-
ations"were being erected. They
were to house hundreds and later
thousands of students. Gardens had
replaced the rubble and debris, and
sports grounds were planned.
The venture owed a large measure
of its success to André Honnorat's
gift for making friends. He never
once applied for Government subsi-
dies. His enthusiasm was such that
he was always able to stimulate
generosity in others and the Cite Uni-
versitaire came into being in much
the same manner as the mediaeval
cathedrals, thanks to the donations
of countless benefactors : Jean Bra-
net, David-Weil, Emile Deutsch de la
Meurthe, to name but a few of Hon-
norat's close collaborators. Finally,
in 1936, an imposing International
House was built ; it owed its existence
to another friend of the founder,
John D. Rockefeller Jr.
Such an undertaking would have
been the lif°_-work of any ordinary
man, but it was only one of Honno-
rat's many and varied activities.
These included th improvement of
public health and social insurance,
the promotion of international cultu-
ral relations and of historical research.
As member of Parliament, he worked
to give his constituency roads, post
offices and power plants.
ANDRE HONNORAT. founder of the
"University City", in Paris. The word"international"can be used to qualify
his every endeavour. Even the small-
est undertaking was an occasion for
him to overcome some obstacle in the
path of international exchange.
It was at his instigation that, in
1915, the French Parliament voted the
first sums for the anti-tuberculosis
campaign and it was thanks to his
efforts and to those of Léon Bourgeois
that the first anti-tubercular dispen-
saries were organized. As president
for many years of the National
Committee of Defense against tuber-
culosis, he launched the well-known
stamp campaign. This undertaking,
which came under heavy criticism,
raised 175 million francs last year for
French sanatoria and dispensaries.
"He Lived Intensely"
A GREAT lover of history, Honnoratundertook the task of preparing
the ground for future historians.
He could not bear to think that com-
ing generations should be hampered
in their research by the lack of indis-
pensable data, and he therefore set
about assembling and distributing to
competent bodies a heterogeneous
collection of contemporary objects,
including books, papers, catalogues,
statuettes and even toys and oil lamps
- which would be of vital interest
to future historians.
.. He lived intensely", said one of
his friends,"poised between past and
present". It can therefore be readily
understood that he had a particular
fondness for the Society of History
of the Great War and for the library
which he founded in 1916 and which
is called today the Bureau of Inter-
national and Contemporary Research.
International... the word recurs
again and again in each of Honnorat's
ventures. The smallest undertaking
served him as a pretext for breaking
down frontiers and for overcoming
some new obstacle on the path of
international exchange. At his instig-
ation, the Government adopted mea-

which inspired André Honnorat-"to teach understanding, what better way can be found
than to bring the elite of the younger generation into contact with one another".
sures to enable the children of French
immigrants in Mexico to complete
their education in France. This led
him to plan wider cultural exchanges.
He was responsible for the Franco-
Norwegian school at Rouen,, the
Franco-Norwegian and Franco-Danish
Associations in Paris, and was instru-
mental in setting up special bodies at
the Sorbonne for the study of Ger-
manic, Italian and Japanese civiliz-
ations. Finally, it was on his initia-
tive that the National Foundation for
the Study of Foreign Civilizations
and Sciences was created.
''You Have
A Responsibility"
THEN came the war of 1939, andAndré Honnorat saw the tempo-
rary destruction of many of his
achievements. Living in retirement,
he continued to work and hope, aided
by his wife and a few friends. With
the liberation of France he returned
to Parliament and to tasks too heavy
for his age and health. His life's
work was once more a living reality ;
yet Honnorat was not content to rest.
He felt the urgency of strengthening
and enlarging his accomplishments.
The Cite Universitaire, which had
been closed for five years, was reopen-
ed and students from thirty nations
filled its 22 houses.
Honnorat now sought to expand the
University of Paris, hemmed in by its
old walls. For this new project he
demanded 160 acres of land. Replying
to parliamentary critics who consider-
ed his proposals premature, he said :
"IN, in 1840, you had been asked to
appropriate land lor the Pasteur
Institute, you would have relused.
You have a responsibility towards the
scholars 01 a hundred years hence.
How are you going to accomodate
them ?"
André Honnorat was now an old
man of failing health, and the bur-
den of public office proved too heavy
for him. He was obliged to abandon
many of his ofncial duties. Though
he no longer had the strength to make
history, his power of vision was as
strong as ever. Courteous, sensitive,
understanding, he still made friends
wherever he went.
H was now over eighty but he
worked, as he had done all his life,
from four o'clock in the morning to
midnight.
Faith In"These Men"
TJ ARLY in the summer of 1950 hishealth failed and the doctors
ordered him to rest. But from
the room which he had finally accept-
ed at the Cite Universitaire he con-
tinued to watch over the freedom, the
welfare and even the finances of his
foundation. The war in Korea affect-
ed him far more than his own suffer-
ings... This world is mad", he said,.. these men want to die". Yet he
never despaired of.. these. men".. He
never lost faith in the United Nations
and international organizations and
tried to help them to the end. One
of the last things he said to his doc-
tor, between two painful attacks, was
this :.. You know, the more I think
about the World Health Organization,
the more I realize it must succeed".
He died on the 24th of July. Two
mouths earlier, disregarding all
advice, he left his sick-bed to receive
the Queen of Holland at the Cite
Universitaire. He wanted to talk once
again to"his students"to talk of
peace-."true peace, to which allmen aspire is not born of written

attztude of mind... from new links
between the young minds of all

NDONESIA PLANS EXPANDED E'DUCATION PROGRAMME
ALMOST a year ago, on December
27, 1949, Indonesia became all
independent state and, as the
Republic of the United States of
Indonesia, took its place among the
family of nations. During the previous
decade, large parts of it had been cut
off from normal contact with other
countries and had suffered heavy
destruction through the war. Indonesia
was therefore in urgent need of reha-
bilitation and technical assistance in
education, public health, agriculture
and in general, of what its Premier,
Mohammed Hatta described as"social
engineering".
Facing up to such needs and recog-
nizing that the prosperity of a
country depends on the qualities and
abilities of its people, the Indonesian
Government is today seeking to provide
the country with an efficient system of
education and training.
Unesco, whose Fifth General Con-
ference admitted Indonesia as a
Member State this year, has already
taken an active part in helping these
efforts. Last May, a Unesco represen-
tative was among the members of the
United Nations Joint Technical Assis-
tance Mission sent to consult with the
Indonesian authorities on their existing
plans for economic development and to
determine in what fields assistance was
most needed.
Today, Indonesia is one cf the 12
countries which Unesco is helping
under the first part of its technical
assistance programme. An education
team is setting in motion a training
programme for teachers who will be
needed in re-settlement areas and as
part of a joint United Nations mission.
Unesco is drawing up a fundamental
education demonstration project and a
teachers'training centre for schools
which will be needed in those areas.
Unesco will also help the Indonesian
Government to establish an adequate
primary school system. (At present
only 25 per cent of the country's school
age children receive instruction and
the adult illiteracy rate is estimated at
from 50 to 90 per cent.)
UNIVERSITY LIFE IN INDONESIA
TODDY, Indonesia is stimulating and encouraging all forms of higher education to ensure thetraining f the experts it will nee  in every held of its future economic development. The main
centres of higher education are two universities, the"Gadjah Mada"University, a national found-
ation established in Djogjakarta, and the University of Indonesia, established in 1'946 at Djakarta. In ad-
dition, there are seven academies and institutes providing instruction in political sciences, forestry,
meteorology, physical culture, mathematics, chemistry and physics, drawing and economic science, as
well as a teachers'college, all of which are attached to one or other of the universities.
Some aspects of the life and work of Indonesian university students are shown in the photographs
published on this page, which were taken from an album prepared by the Indonesian Government as
a gift for Unesco and presented to M. Jaime Torres Bodet, the Director-General, by H. E. Mr. Nazir'

MICHEL VOROSMARTY.
"Every individual is entitled to a nation-
ality."But when this Hungarian poet
was born on 1st December 1800, his people
had not the right to claim Hungarian
nationality. Vorosmarty helped by worthy
colleagues, worked all his life to arouse
his country from somnolence and servitude.
He wrote an epic,"The Flight of Zalan"
to celebrate the. heroic conquest of the
plains of the Tisza and Danube by the
ancient Magyars He revealed Hungarian
letters to the world, translated Shake-
speare, and adapted the French Roman-
tics. As a deputy in the 1848 Revolution,
he fought till the last day for liberation
and, after his country's defeat, spent two
years in prison. His funeral was the
opportunity for a national protest against
the Hapsburg domination and his centen-
ary was feted gloriously throughout all
Hungary.
"THE ADVANCE OF HUMAN
THOUGHT".
Without real hope for the future advance
of society it is doubful whether men
/MMM/91 hopp12md
in (/) JH : Jl.In6...
would fight very hard for their liberties
and their rights. A certain optimism is
needed. On 11th December 1750, Jacques
Turgot, spoke in Latin at the Sorbonne on
"The successive stages in the progress of
human thought" :
"The language and the writing.... from
all the special branches of learning
create a common treasure that one gener-
ation passes on to the next. so that the
heritage is constantly increasing."
"Even in the midst of havoc... people
become more civilized, the human mind
becomes enlightened, isolated nations
come closer together, commerce and poli-
tics finally unite all parts of the globe.
and mankind as a whole continues to move
forward through alternate periods of calm
and trouble. Progress may be halting, but
it is always towards greater heights".
 EVERY PERSON HAS THE RIGHT
TO WORK..."
... To free choice of employment... to
protection against unemployment..." (art.
23). To help make these rights a reality
is the responsibility of the International
Labour Organization which four years
ago, on 14th December 1946, joined forces
with the United Nations. But, the Or-
ganization, under a slightly different
name, had already been in existence
27 years and had never ceased fighting
for the principles that the United Nations
were to restate in the Universal Declar-
ation. Since 1919, the Organization has
continued to declare that work is not mer-
chandise ; that freedom of expression and
assembly is essential to progress ; that the
wretched plight of workers in one country
threatens the prosperity of workers in all
other countries, that the light for just and
favourable conditions of work requires the
joint efforts of all governments and all
workers.
ARSNE D'ARSONVAL.
When d'Arsonval died on 30th Decem-
ber 1940, more than one journalist hesit-
ated before the long list of this learned
man's works. It seemed scarcely credible
that one man should have been respons-
ible for so many discoveries. He worked
with Claude Bernard and Pasteur, but he
was also distinguished as an electrical
scientist. He invented the galvanometer
with a mobile circuit, used in canalyzing
the electric currents of the brain. Noted
as one of the founders of endocrinology,
he was also known as the designer of one
of the earliest glides and as the inventor
of a battery for submarines. But his chief
fame rests in work which led to the in-
mention of an"electrical bistoury", a
scalpel for surgeons. All his work was
devoted to giving a concrete meaning to
this"right to health"about which men
would know so little, if learned men did
not work to make it a reality.
If PROMOTE UNDERSTANDING
TOLERANCE AND FRIENDSHIP
AMONG ALL NATIONS."
Three hundred and fifty years ago a
poet died whose work and life give ad-
mirable evidence of the philosophical and
religious tolerance which made sixteenth
century India so noteworthy. Work went
beyond mere.. tolerance" and contributed
to Dadu's mutual understanding of the
highest kind. Some say he was born into
a Brahman family ; others that his father
was Moslem, but all agree that this mys-
tic belonged to the Hindu faith during his
life. This did not deter him from his
affection for the great Moslem poet Kabir :
"The words of Kabir are as true to the
spirit as they are pleasant to the ear. They
bring me happiness". He spent his life in
travelling across the Indian empire and
composed his poems in Hindi, In Pujani, in
Sanskrit... As was true of Kabir's work,
Dadu's poems transcended all the bonds
of orthodoxy. Dadu continually stressed
the universality of love :"The world is
full of divine truth"he used to say. He
died at Naraina, in the Rajputana, mur-
muring one of his poems :"Spirit. 0 my
spirit, for the love of your Lord, you have
shaken oll all seeming..."

"but", he went on,"the blind can read well enough by Breathe".
As far back as 1686 the Church in Finland had made it compulsory
for everyone to learn to read. The priests refused to give Confirmation to those
who were illiterate and marriage by a priest was denied them. It was custom-
ary for the pastor to hold annual examinations for his flock and the results
were written down in the parish records. Young folk who refused to go to
school were put in the stocks on Sunday at the entrance to the church. Kivi,
the great Finnish writer who founded the theatre and the Finnish novel, gives
a vivid account in"T1 ; e Seven Brothers"of a battle royal between a Rector
and seven boys who refused to learn to read.
In the year 1866 the Church relin-
quished its role of educator and
teaching became the responsibility of
the municipal authorities. The law
of compulsory schooling, however,
only dates back to 1921, the year
when the Republic of Finland came
into being. To-day, though the
population is extremely scattered,
with only eight inhabitants to the
square mile in some regions, illite-

a school must be built in any region
where there are sixteen children of

radius of approximately three miles.
The children arrive by bicycle, on

sometimes special buses are provided,
and in districts where the terrain is
difficult, there are omnibus-boats.

sufficient to satisfy healthy young
appetites.
Books and general school require-
ments have been supplied without cost
for many years. Boarding schools are
provided for children who live more
than three miles from school. In
villages where such an arrangement
is impracticable, free board and lodg-
ing is found in a neighbour's home.
Local authorities control education
and all school activities. A school
committee of five persons, including
at least one teacher, is elected by the
Municipal Council. The administr-
ation of each school is in the hands
of a group of seven people, six of
whom are parents of the pupils and
one a representative of the teaching
faculty.
Holiday On Skis
THE State Education Departmentacts in an dvisory capacity.
According to the wealth of the
community and its inhabitants, gov-
ernment aid plays a greater or lesser
role ; but in no case does it cover all
the expenses. The State pays
teachers'salaries and provides 20 %
of the finance for the building of new
schools and 40 % for maintenance.
Government loans are also granted
and the State reimburses two-thirds
of the money paid out for eq1ipment
and financial aid to poor children ; in
each case the State contribution is
generally proportionate to the size of
the school.
A child spends eight years at pri-
mary school. There are 36 school
weeks in a year broken by the Christ-
mas and summer holidays. The chil-
dren are also given a special week's
holiday just before Spring-during
the best skiing season.
Hygiene plays an important part in
school life. Even the most remote
schools have nurses, who also serve
as welfare officers. The children are
vaccinated and receive special eye and
dental care from visiting doctors at
regular intervals.
I paid a visit to one of hese coun-
try schools, a large one-storey house.
Fair-haired healthy children were
hurrying out across the verandah.
The classroom was spacious, clean and
well equipped. Some explanatory
notes from the previous lessons still
remained on the blackboard. A blaz-
ing fire roared in the big stove. It
was one of the happiest and pleasant-
est schoolrooms I had ever visited.
Youth Has Priority
FINLAND, to-day, with 4 million in-habitants, has nearly 16, 000 teach
ers in its primary schools which
serve more than 500, 000 children
between the ages of seven and
fifteen. Ninety-two per cent of these
schoolchildren learn Finnish, 8 %
learn Swedish. Both these languages
are officially recognized, and this
creates numerous difficulties in giving
instruction in the langllage requested
by the parents.
It is astonishing to note the great
extent to which children develop their
fondness for reading at school. Out
of the 2, 000 new books published in
Finnish every year-a surprisingly
high figure for such a small popul-
ation-more than 10 % are books
for children. These books are usually
well illustrated not only with their
own national heroes but also with the
great figures found in children's
books all over the world.
Finlanders love their children and
want to ensure that their future will
be a bright and happy one. The pre-
sent generation was compelled to
endure several wars in order to win
and keep its freedom. Normality is
gradually being restored. The needs
of youth have priority in Finland :
for, in the words of the Finnish poet,
Elmer Diktonius :"As long as chil-
dren smile, the Universe will continue
to live".
