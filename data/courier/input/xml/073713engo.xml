Unesco Outlines Vjea ! II. N Meetings

On Free Information
THE first two resollÌtionS to be adopted ; without. opposit. ion by
thé United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information,
meeting at Geneva since March 23. were direc : ly inspirep by the work
of Unesco. One resolution praises the Organisation for lits technical
needs surveys of war devastated
areas and recommends that active
steps be taken by Unesco and the
Specialised Agencies of the UN
to meet these needs. Thé second
approves the proposai"00 estao-
lish an International Institute of
Press and Information under the
aruspices of Unesco".
. Unesco is thus taking an active
part in the work of the Geneva
Conference on Freedom of In-
formation. which has attraeted
wide attention throughout thé
word. The conference,-which'is
still in progress, is being attended
by delegates from 64 nations, the
Specialised Agencies of the UN
and governmental and inter-
governmental organisations.
In an important speech deliver-
ed at the eonferenee on March 25
Dr. Huxley. Director-General of
Unesco, defined the prineiples of
freedom of information ehiefly as
"a just equalisation of the ma-
terial and technical means of
communication and of the mutual
sharing of the technical skills
which attaeh to the working of
these communication systems"
and"a sense of responsibility on
the part of those who use the
media of modern communica-
tions". (Excerpts from this ad-
dress will be found elgewhere on
this page.)
Later in the discussion several
delegates cited the authority of
Unesco by direct reference 00 Dr.
Huxley's speech. His words also
served as a guide for the Unesco
delegation in Geneva which is
headed by Mur John Grierson and
M. René Maheu.
The Geneva Conferenee divided
the items on its agenda among
four committees, two of which
deal with technical and profes-
sional problems. It is at these
two committees that Unesco's.
contributions have been mos,
noteworthy.
Needs Surveys DiSçyssed
In its study of unhampered
publieation and reception of in-
formation, the eonference turned
to Unesco's 1947-48 survey on tech-
nical needs. Amongst the fore-
most obstaeles to the free ex-
change of information is the need,
especially acute since the war, for
such indispensable tools as radio
sets, teletype machines and print-
ing presses and the crying need
for newsprint.
The delegates heard M. Desjar-
dins, of Unesco, report on th"
work the Organisation has done
ta date to study thé technical
needs of the less fortunate coun-

tries and the plans for assistance
made to meet these needs. M,
Maheu reviewed Unesco's efforts
to alleviate the newsprint short-
age of the poorer nations with a
plan for mutual aid. and reeaUed
a deelaration of the American
delegation promising the support
and participation of the United
States in the programme of im-
mediate newsprint aid for China,
France and the Netherlands.
U nanimous Resolution
Following these discussions the
delegates unanimousiy approved
the following resolution :
"This Conference, having heard
the representatives of Unesco,
congratulates that Organisation
on its enquiries into technical
needs... expresses the hope that
Unesco will proceed with-the ut-
most speed in carrying out the
programmes it has prepared in
this connection... and recom-
mends that very early arrange-
ments be made by Unesco, with
the help of the other Specialised
Agencies concerned, to meet the
needs of these countries... re-
commends that the Eeonomie and
Social Couneil instruct its iegional
economie commissions and re-
quest the eompetent Specialised
Agencies to assist Unesco in this
task."
On April 6, Unesco expressed
its views on the important ques-
tion of the professional training
of journalists and the ereation of
an international Press institut. e.
The Unesco delegation pointed
out that if, as Dr. Huxley had
said, the problem of information
involves the content of informa-
tion, then its solution der>ends. in
large measure on the quality of

lVew Sufveys on
Technical Needs
Unesco experts have left
Paris to continue the
technical needs surveys in
the fields of press, film
and radio begun in 1947 in'
war-devastated countries.
Equipped with exhaustive
questionnaires, the experts
will begin surveys expèêted
to take about three months
work in the fteld. Upon
their return to Paris, thé
reports will be analysed
and compiled into a volu-
me of detailed Information
similar to. the 200-page
report published last year,
"Report of the Commission
on Technical Needs in
Press, Film, Radio".
The countries to be
surveyed this year include :
Austria. Bulgaria, Hungary,
Italy, Roumania ; Colombia,
Cuba, Ecuador, Haiti, Hon-
duras, Mexico, Peru, Do-
minican Republic and Ve-
nezuela ; India, Pakistan,
Burma and Malaya.
Thé'questionnaires re-
questing some two thousand
answers are directed tô
the governments, schools,
commercial companies and
the working members of the
professions in the countries
under survey, and will calI
for information on availa-
bUity of newsprint and
other raw materials, the
type and quantity of prin-
ting, filming and broad-
casting facilities, professio-
nal and technical training
and the obstacles to the
free flow of information.

At Geneva. Conferencet Ca y/erece
The following is the abridged text of the addr ? ss
delivered in Geneva on March 25 by Dr. Julian
S. Huxley, Director-General of Unesco, before tbe
United Nations Conference on Freedom of Infor-
mation : 
Ida not need ta emphasise Unesco's interest inthis question of freedom of information.
Wherever Unesco urns in its task of deploying
and developing the resources of education, science
and culture in the cause of rmuual understanding,
it deals, of necessity, with the flow of information
across the borders of nations...
Unesco has, on the invitation of the United
Nations, actively participated in the preparation
ai this conference, both in the general work of
the sub-commission and in the work of the Secre-
tariat. Here today, however, we come to the
moment of practical decision.
Unesco cannot be content merel# ta eX'Press its
sympathetic interest in the question before us.
but, by the very nature of the tasks ta which it is
dedicated as a Specialised Agency, it is bound ta
emphasise its des ire and also ils obligation ta help
you bring a living result from the body of this
conference.
This conference has before it the special work
of preparing international agreements on jreedom
of information, as deriving fram and giving reality
M, one of the jundamental rights of man...
Without a doubt we must meet and agree on a
certain number of directive principles... But here
1 might be permitted ta quote 1100 the advice M) catch
M. Jacques Maritain gave ta us in his inaugural
address ta the General Conference ilt Mexico las'
December.
Seeking ta iso/ate and define the spiritual roofs
of international understanding, M. Maritain dis-
tinguished between speculative and explanatory
ideologies, on which agreement is never likelll ta
be found, and principles of human ac/ion on whi. ch
men in general are agreed because the1/do in
fact express their common will as human beings
everywhere...
Taking mylp. ad from the distinguished French
philosopher, 1 say that only a practical and not
a theoretical conception of freedom of information
is capable of overriding the political and cultural
differences of peopl !'Os...
The spirit of liberty is itself hostile ta abstraction :
freedom can onlJl be defined in cancre te terms...
It is an active force or it is nothing... The problem
is, therefore, one of sa organising bath the spiritual
and the materia/forces of the world to-daJl that in
action and by action, the word of freedom is made
flash.
It is, moreover, the view and emphasis of Unesco
that these forces of action :.. on/JI draw their strength
and value from their relationship with the actual
and patent needs of people as they are feint in
cam mon, appreciated in common and realiseà in
common.
(Continued on Page 2)
Another project is that Unesco
will study the question of text-
books in Germany ta define the
criteria that should guide the pré-
paration and publication of such
textbooks from Unesco's point of
view.
Initially, these and other activ-
ities will be carried out only in
the thnee western zones of Ger-
many as Unesco offieials have as
yet been unable to enter into ne-
gotiations with the Russian occur
pation authorities.
Executive Board approval for
such work came after three days'
'discussion during an extraordinary
meeting of the Board in Paris.
April 2, 3, 4. It was aIso agreed
that negotiations with the A1lied
Supreme Commander in Japan be
accelerated 50 that similar Unesco
work may be begun in that cour-
try.
The Polish member of the
Board urged that Unesco should
proceed very cautiously in any
projeets dealing with Germany.
The Czech member, M. Opocensky,
who was unable 00 attend the ses-
sions, nt a telegram declaring
his opposition to any immediate
activities within Germany.
Mr. Walter H. C. Laves, Deputy
Director-General, recently visited
Berlin ta discuss the question of
Unesco activities in Germany with
the Allied Zone Commanders. He
consulted with General Sir Brian
Robertson, British Zone Com-
mander, General Lucius D. Clay,
United States Zone Commander.
and with General Noiret, Deputy
to General Koenig, French Zone

arrange a meeting with Générât

2 UNESCO COURIER
HERE can be no doubt that the peace of the worló depends
! o-day on the effective functioning of the United Nations
and its related Specialised Agencies. Of this framework
of United Nations institutions Unesco is a part, guided
by the same principles and assumptions underlying the
United Nations Charter, and functioning as co-ordinately
as passible with ail of the Agencies concerned,
In the scheme of world institutions thus developed, Unesco has
; ; ; précise and special function. Simply stated, it is to further inter-
national understanding through science, education and culture.
Like most constitutions, that of Unesco means different things to
different people, because individuats hâve différent purposes in
mind and because this Constitution, like any other, contains many
general phrases, allowing considerable flexibility iu interprétation.
Thus, on some occasions it has appeared that a choice had ta be
made between two extreme views concerning Unesco's function. One
view is that the Organisation should concentrate all of its anergies
upon those things whieh wiU affect the immediate prospects for
international peace and understanding Another view is that the
Organisation should promote international collaboration in science,
education and culture, from which
Unesco and theW òrk
Of the United Nations
hy Mr Walter H. C. LA V ES
Deputy Direclor-General
more peaceful relations may be a
by-product. A balance between
these two views must develop in
the Organisation programme.
Even a easual examination of
the most critiool current interna-
tional problems confirms the
view that it is essential to provide
n common ground of communica-
tion and understanding between
the peoples of the world if the
U. N. approach is ta succeed at
all. The barriers to free and ob-
jective communication and ta
community thinking between the
people of the Orient and Occi-
dent, Eastern and Western Eu-
rope, and the Occupied territories
and the rest of the world, are 50
great that even the most elemen-
tary common goals of peace and
prosperity are jeopardized. Ta
help in establishing communica-
tion based upon common interest
in education, science and culture.
and thus ta increase the pro-
spects for international under-
standing is the special function
of Unesco among the United Na-
tions institutions.
Three Important
Assumptions
As already suggested, the as-sumptions underlying the
United Nations and Specialised
Agencies are fundamentally the
same. and among Miese, three
are particularly important.
The first is that the nations 1
of the world and the activities
of their peoples have reached a 1
point of mutual dependence at
which the maintenance of peace
and the furtherance of sound
economic, cultural, social and po-
litical relations cannot be left
any longer solely to the actions
of individual nation states : world
community procedures are re-
quired.
The second assumption js that
this need for world community
procedures js sufficiently re-
cognised among peoples and na-
tions to ensure a co-operative
approach within the United Na-
tions framework, and a continued,
wilIingness of nations to seek
truly international solutions for
international problems : a word
community attitude is essential.
The third assumption is that 1
15 possible ta develop United Na-j
tions institutions, staffed by corn-,
petent personnel able and wi1ling Ii
to adopt a completely interna-
tional approach in their thinking 1
and actions : a world communityCivil service is possible.
The attainment of the objec-j
tives of the United Nations land 1
the Specialized Agencies dépends
upon the acceptance and realiza-
tion of these assumptions.
Institutions for the Solution 1
ofCommon Problems'1
i
THE United Nations and Spe- !- *-cialised Agencies were envi- !
saged toward the end of word'o
War II as institutions for the
solution of common problems in
a world newly dedicated  peace
and the freedoms set forth in the
Atlantic Charter. These prob-
lems cover the range of human
aetivity : economic, political, fi-
nancial, social, cultural, educa-
tional, scientific, etc. A world
still in the stage when men live
in highly organised national
states, often moved by national-
ism, provincialism, prejudice and
ethnocentrism had developed
many functional relationships
which made the acceptance of the
"One World"thesis imperative for
maintaining prosperity and peace.
The common war effort of 19H-
18 had aIready given rise to the
League of Nations, in which va-
luable experience was gained in
the use of world community pro-
cedures. The war-time co-opera-
tion of the United Nations in
World War II renewed men's
belief that international proce-
dures might be used for meeting
urgent world problem. upon the
solution of which depend the pro-
spects for peace, prosperity and
human progress.
The establishment of Unesco
itself clearly was premised upon
an acceptance of this same a. s-
sumption, and its Constitution
and purpose provide procedures
for action in the fields QJ éduca-
tion, science and culture for
people of all faiths, politieal
beliefs and cultures.
The second assumption, that a
world community attitude is es-
sential for building a peaeeful
world, is reflected in those por-
tions of Unesco's programme re-
lating to education for interna-
tional understanding, develop-
ment of the mats média of com-
munication, exchange of persons
and information, etc. AU of these
foster the growth and strengthen-
ing of a world approach to world
problems.
Some spécial features exist m
Unesco's organisation to en-
courage the growth of a world
community attitude. Although
Unesco is an inter-governmental
institution, it is the essence of its
work to further the establishment
of direct personal relations across
international frontiers in the
fields of education, science and
culture. Quite obviousiy, this ap-
proach presents many difficult
procedural problems, especially in
relation to Member Governments,
since the world of to-day is organ-
used on a national basis. The con-
duet of foreign affairs is a gov-
ernmental function and the life
and action of individuals and
voluntary organisations are gen-
erally regarded as coming within
the surveillance of national states...
Success in furthering direct con-
tact between individuals separat-
cd by national boundaries reflects
a graduai acceptance of the world
community approach by Member
States.
National Commissions :
A. Newlink Between
Peoples of W orle
A NOTHER illustration of the or-. L ganisational acceptance of the
second assumption is found in
the constitutional provision re-
garding the establishment of
Unesco national commissions or
co-operating bodies. The Secre-
Uiriat has been enjoined by each
General Conference ta take po-
sitive steps to encourage the créa-
tion of such bodies. These bodies
provide primary interest groups
in Member States and the pro-
g. ramme of the Organisation is
addressed to work and aetivity
that can be carried on by such
national commissions and co-
operating bodies. The growth of
such groups, bound together by
a common purpose and similar
programmes, provides a new
means of communication between
the peoples of the world, through
channels approved by their gov-
ernments.
In still another way Unesco's
manner of functioning assumes a
common ground among the people
of Member States and builds upon
the second assumption. Its Exe-
cutive Board, consisting of eight-
een members, elected by the Gen-
eral Conference from among the
delegates 00 the General Confer-
ence, consists of persons selected
for their eompetenee in the arts,
the humanities, the sciences, edu-
cation and the diffusion of ideas.
They are appointed by govern-
ments : by the Constitution they
serve as individuals and not as-
government delegates. This Board
is charged with responsibility for

Unesco believes that this conception 0/needs
and their satisfaction, should be the biLSis of ail
our discussions, :/Me are ta appear as practical
men in the service of mankind. It seems ta us the

today... Freedorn oj information is neiíher a luxury
nor an ideal ; it is a necessity, if the native and
natural frustrations which we see in the world
today are not () blow up in our fasces...
Everyone is agreed ta the lowering of barriers
ta the jree flow of information. However. what 1
have ta stress here is that this aim, and the
methods of achieving it, must be strictlll and prac-
ticallp conditioned.
... One condition, hast we must immediately reCOg-

Two further essential conditions of anll effective
realisation of freedom of information are : a iu. t
equalisation of the material and technical means
of communication and of the mu tUai sharing of
the technical skills which attach to the working
of these communication systems. A fourth essenlial
is a sense of responsibilitv on the part of those
who use the media of modern communications, as
freedom of information deve ! ops on the inter-
national plane...
Content of Information
The realisation of freedom of information does
not consist simply in opening up access ta more
and more masses of information of any and every
kind. Nor does it mean merely the absence of let
or hindrence tei information... A laisser-faire anarchy
in the services of informatiOn is incompatible with
the true nature of liberty, and can only derive from
a blindness to the real needs of the world, tO the
real inequalities which exist, to the basic character
of many of the obstacles which have been es-
tobHshed, and ta the true sOurces of the differences
of opinion on the nature of these ob. tac ! es...
We must have it in our considered minds ta
denounce bath the distortion of news and the com-
mon vulgarity of which the purveyor., of news are
sa frequently guilty. Here the professiona ! organi-
sations in the field of information, with their un-
doubted awareness of the problem before us, have
a great social l'ole ta play in applying themselve.
even more intensely to the con, ! ideration of the
se !/-cr : ttC ! SM, se !/-f ! ! Sc : pHKe ttKd se !/-e< ! ! <c<ttt07t Mhtchlf e iticism, self-discipline and self-edlte/Hion which
the occasion requises.
What criteria are we to adopt in the evaluation
of the content of information ? If we atta ( ; h
OMrsehjes, as in the old days ouf artisan press solely
ta the individnal's right ta express himself, the
only criterion we c : an adopt is the criterion of trurh.
From this standpoint, the only constraints you can
' ; Isk for are those rooted in the requiremenls oi
public order. Further, it has become plain ta us
how much too general is this criterion of abstract
truth.., It would be better, 1 suggest, to describe
freedom of information in terms of the functional
lelationship of information ta the needs of the
people, whether il be in recognition of the mass of
the people as the only true fount of right and
law, or whether it be simply in recognition of their
right to the information they need...
It ils. 1 believe, when we look on the problems
of information in this way that we begin ID reatise
their deep relationship with science imd culture.
Erery group, scientific, artistic, professional ar social
which has its reality in performing a service to
mankind should, for this retts<&gt;n, have ils OWIt
argans of information and expression. Tholtgh
from one angle they may represent different and
sometimes conflicling professional interests, theit'
contributions are necessary tO the common welfare
of mankind and ID the international tJ. nderstanding
and unit y we seek.
It is with this in mind that Unesco's programme
tòday is devoted, on the one hand, to meeting (he
technwal needs 1 have mentioned. But it also
launches OUf to, include the interchange of man's
aehievements in science and the arts, philOsophy
and the humanities. ln particular Unesco is
developing today a large programme of article.

which will oe interehanged amongst the nations of
the world.
It is out of these various considerations that 1
have instructed my representatives here in Geneva
tO present to the eonfere1UY1 onlJl proposais which
we consider to be concrete and pract ! ca !.
Unesco is, by its chameter and Charter dedicated
to freedom of information. But because we attach
slæh impartanee 10 il, it is the substance and not
the shadow which we want. We want Ihat substance
to be emphasised in practical measures and asso-
ciated with the living and working groups which
everywhere represent the creative forces in society
to-day...
We cannot af/ ? rd any longer to have liberty
confused, whether in ! he minds of Doliticians, in-
tellectuals or commerc1al opernfors, eith. er with the
fares of privilege or with the fo :. ces of anarchy.
This we say must be done with, for only then can

once and for oH, that the on and only begelter
of freedom is the spirit of traternitJl itself.
the execution of the programme
voted by the General Conference.
Its members are in effect, there-
fore, a world council on science,
education a'nd culture, not re-
sponsible, as such, ta governments
for what they do, but responsib
in tact for the execution of tbe
programme of an international
organisation supported by Mem-
ber Government.
In some countries some of the
delegates to the General Confer-
ence, from among whom the
Executive Board is elected, are
nominated by professional groups
which compose Unesco national
commissions or co-operating bo-
dies. To this extent again the pro-
cess of building the wOrld com-
munity has thus been pressed a
step further.
The very concept of United Na-
tions planning and action on
matters of international concern
is premised on the third assump-
tion ; that it is possible to staff
United Nations Agencies with per-
sons dedieated to an interna-
tional service and willing ta fore-
go the guidance of purely na-
tional viewpoints in which they
have usually been trained.
The League of Nations and cer-
tain other earlier International
Agencies made great progress de-
veloping such staffs, and the
United Nations Ageneies have
found here considerable ex-
perience and precedent for de-
veloping their own services.
A Common Aim
UNESCO has made progress indeveloping such a staff, al-
though tbe odds have thus far
been against the attainment of
this objective. The uncertainties
of the programme, inevitable in
its first year ; the necessity of
recruiting staff under pressure of
time ta meet the deadUne of the
annual èonference of 1947 ; the
consequent inability ta carry on a
large-scale world-wide recruitment
programme ; the tendency of
Member states ta keep tbe ser-
vices of the best available na-
tionals for home industry and
public service, and finally the
inevitable uneertainties of the
post-war international politieal
scene, have aU been barriers ta
the effective establishment of a
truly international civil service.
Building a Secretariat requires
not only the right personnel. It
a ! so requires daily preoccupation
with the problem of knitting a
coherent staff for a common pur-
pose and on sound organisational
principles. In part this is a mat-
ter of leadership, not merely at
the top but throughout the Or-
ganisation. In part it is a matter
of language 50 that people under-
stand each other. But more than
any of thèse it is a matter of
developing eommonly acceptable
work habits and working relations
among persons who come from
eompletely different societies and
varyingly organised institutions,
but who have a common'purposes
and aHegiance. No one national
system is right ; each must make
its best contribution 00 the de-
velopment of international ad-
ministration.
These problems have faced aIl
United Nations Agencies, but
special difficulties have arise in
Unesco because it requires the
services of technical personnel,
most of wtiotA hâve not had
bureaucratie experience, or ex-
perience in an international or-
ganisation.
The activities of Unesco provide
a new method for developing
close relations among the peoples
of the world. As these activities
grow and succeed they provide
an increasingly fi. rm basis of in-
ternational understanding and ex-
perience upon which the tune-
tioning of the United Nations aDel
ii6 related Ageneies dependt.

UNESCO COURIER
UNESCO'S visit to Beirut inOctober of this year is not
going to be just a reminder to
the Arab States of what the UN
is doing ; for education, science
and culture. It is also going to be
a reminder to ail the nations of
the world of the great and ali-
important place the Arab world
holds in the history of thought.
A Scotsma, n who spent many
years of his life on the far away
islands reaching northward to
Nonway recently recalled his
youthful excitement when lie
learned that the designs which
were used on the jerseys of his
native district in Scotland, were
of Arabic source. They had comas
aIl they way from Spain starting
with the Spanish galleon which
had been wrecked on one of the
8i. cilian islands at the end of the
16th Century. He recalled the
thrill that had come to him upon
learning, in school, that the word
algebra was of Arabic origin and
that ehemistry was derived from
the Arabic word alchemy and that
Binbad thé Sailor and the Thou-
sand and One Nights were only
a part of a vast poetie literature.
The philosophers and the scient-
ists who gather in Beirut at Unes-
co's Thirds General Conference
will undoubtedly take the oppor-
tunity to pay proper due to the
astonishing and important fac
in intellectual history that it was
the Arabie pèople who kept alive
the intellectual tradition of the
Greeks and not least, the teaching
of Aristotle between the fall of
Rome and the European Renais-
canote.

The arts and skills of algebra
and trigonometry and mathema-
tics and geography and medicine
and botany owe their historica. !

understanding and peace. The

'''III Quest of Learnillg"
The problem of explaining the
influence that the Arabs have
had on Western civilisation can
be approached in two ways. It
is possible either to make broad
statements, which while impres-
aive and truc may fail to touch
the reader because of their remo-
teness from everyday life, or we
may touch here and there on the'most ordinary objects which the
West owes ro the Arab world and
which the West takes for granted
until some twitch of the thread
of history jerks baek into our
minds thé réalisation of what has,
in fact. happened.
Handfuls of Arabie coins of thé
IOth Century found on a remote
island in the Baltic Sea ; a"jour-
ney in quest of learning"made
by the historian Al-Mas-udi to
Zanzibar ; a regular trade route
linking Spain with Central Asia.
These are only a few of the indi-
cations of how the Arabs ranged
round the seas eager for know-
1ence leaving their mark on the
world about them. For basically, from the point ouf
view of the West, the Ara. b Renaissance flourished in
the 8th Century A. D., anticipating the Western Re-
naissance by seven hundred years.
The interest of the Arabic people in geography
brought them rich dividends, but this interest came
originally not from a desire for trade. It sprang from
a very different source-the need for pilgrims ta find
their way across the trackless sands to Mecca, the
nesd to site mosques, 50 that they pointed to the Holy
City and the desire of faittlful Moslems to be sure
that, at their prayers, they faeed toward the Kaba.
The discoveries of the voyagers, the findings of the
thinkers and investigators of the day were recorded
on paper for the first time in history. At the same
time. centuries before Gutenberg, mechanical dupli-
cating systems were introduced to make possible the
diffusion of these writings, Even the problem of
copyrht, in which Unesco is interested today in an
Silkll anl Satins
In making life more agreeable
for themselves the Arabs develop-
ed to a high degree the art of
produeing textiles-the silks and
satins and tapestries mentione<1
above. Damascus made damask,
muslin came from Mosul, Bagh-
dad produced baldaquins, and sa
on, in a rich flood of colour and
designs.
Arab culture thus was slowly
absorbed by the West. From the
Arabs in Spain, Arabic skills and
customs made their way to Pro-
vence (garnished by the charm-
ing songs of the troubadours),
from Provence into Lorraine, and
thence au ove Europe.
The tragedy of this contact,
however, is that there is so much
that the Westerners never did
learn. The great literature of the
Arab world is still almost literally
comained in sealed books un-
known to most of us.
The Arab world had its first
great flowering a thousand to
twelve hundred years ago, but
even now, in some branches of
thought, the West is only beginn-
ing to catch up with it. Thus,
for example, the Arabs long ago
insisted that a medical docOOr be
not only a physician but a meta-
physician, a philosopher and a
sage, and thus understand fully
the value of psychology ion heal-
ing.
Indeed, such wus thé work done
in the field of medicine that Avi-
cenna (Ibn Sina, 980 to 1037
A. D.), who was not only a doctor
and a philosopher but a philo-
logist and poet as well. served
as the chief medical authority 00
the West until the 17th Centuxy
Another Arab philosopher, Ibn-
Roschid, known ta Western Eu-
rope as Averroes, and whose nu-
merous writings (he is said ta
have used over 10, 000 sheets of
paper) summed up the work of
Muslim thinkers up ta the end
of the 12th Century, was de-
scribed by Renan as the"BoethlU5
of Arab philosophy".
Averroes
The introduction of Averroes
meant the end of the Dark Ages.
To Dante, he was"the Commen-
tator"par exeellence-"Averrois,
che il gran commenta feo". Dis-
cussed, prohibited, but always
widely, read, he was for many
centuries one of the main forces
which lead to the Renaissance ;
By the beginning of the 16th Cen-
tury he had become, to quote
Renan again,"almost the officiai
philosophy of Italy in gênerai".
As one secs the new Arab world
of today, one recalls that the
phoenix, which rises splendidly
from its ashes to a new life. is a
bird whose dwehing place is Ara-
bia and that his miraoolous
powers of ré-incarnation are not
yet exhausted.

Accompanying Dr. Huxley
are Mr Claude Berkley, his

Government to carry out an
inquiry into cultural affairs in
the Middle East.
In addition to extending
personal invitations 00 attend

between Unesco. and the go-

Lebanon Preparing Sile
for Beirut Conference
At its. Second Session, at Mexico
City, the General Conference
agreed, at the invitation of the
Lebanon, to hold its Third Ses-
sion at Beirut. In February the
Executive Board confirmed this
decision and fixed the Conference,
tentatively, from OCtober 14 10
November 6.
In January, two members of
the Secretariat visited Beirut 00
investigate its facilities and re-
sources, in the light of the vari-
ous technical problems which
the Conference's Session will cre-
ate. They were weil received by
the Lebanese authorities.
The l'remises which seem the
most suitable for the work of the
Session consist of a group of
buildings some two hundred yards
from the shore and a quarter of
an hour's'drive from the centre
of the town. The existing build-
ings can provide offices for aU
the delegations. Three halls for
plenary meetings and the meet-
lngs of Commissions are being
construeted.
It is hoped to recruit a large
proportion of the techn : cal staff
locally, and thus ta reduce 00 a
minimum the size of the staff
to be moved. since this is the
most expensive item in the Con-
ference's budget.
The authorities in the host
country h a v e undertaken to
meet the cost of aU supplies, fur-
niture and the fitting up of pre-
mises, and more especially the
cost of hiring the equipment for
simultaneous intérpretation which
French ScbðOlboys receive ft packages of school supplies, collected
by U. S. children of Michigan and MassachUMtts. Gifts, which were
shipped for distribution through Unesco, were presented in March
to the schools of Boulo (ne-sur-Seine, a. war-hit industrial Suburb
of Paris. Above, Dr. Kuo Yn-Shou, Head of Unesco's Education
Section who represented Unesco with Mr. J.-P. Sussel of Recons-
kuction Section.
will be installed in two or three
of the Conference rooms.
The working languages of the
Beirut Conference will be English
and French ; but in order that
the Conferenee may attract
greater attention throughout the
Near East, the Lebanese author-
Hies have asked that Arabie be
a working language at meetings
where simultaneous interpréta-
tion is used. In addition, the
main documents and the Confer-
ence Journal will be translated
into Arabie. The staff required
for the work of interpretation
and translation into Arabic and
for the preparation of documents
in that language will be recruited
and paid by the Lebanese Gov-
ernment.
Agenda and Organisation
of W work
Member States have been ask-
ed to inform the Director-General
of questions which they wish
placed on the amenda of the
Beirut Conférence. In April, a
Committee of the Executive
Board wUl, in the light of the
Member States'replies, fix the
Conference's provisional agenda.
which will be sent forthwith'to
11. 11 those States. The latter Iwill
thus have sufficient time in
which to consult their National
Commissions and appoint their
delegations.
As the Organisation already
has a programme most elements
of which will take two or more
years to carry out, it seems super-
fluons to debate the whole of the
programme over again. The Con-
ference, while eonsidering a limit-
cd number of questions, will be
able to devote some time to an
active and thorough examination
of completely fresh projects, or
of projects already voted but for
Iwhich a change of direction may
be required.
The Generrl Conference will
also study the reports submitted
by the Member States, the deci-
sions with regard 00 new applica-
tions for membershtp of the Or-
ganisation, and elect seven mem-
bers of the Executive Board. It
will appoint a Director-General,
and deliver its opinion on various
questions of internai organisation
and on the work of the National
Commissions. It will vote the
Budget for 1949,
Ta permit ail delegations being
represented on aU thé working
bodies, not more than four meet-
ings, will be held simultaneousiy.
and during the General Confer-
ence no reglonal or special con-
ferences will be held at Beirut.

Anthropologist Reports
on Fundamental Education
HE social anthropologist, be-cause of the very nature of
his science and the special
methods he has devised for
carrying out his work has long
been aware of problems of educa-
tion, particularly among primitive
and somewhat acculturated peo-
ples.
Unesco has shown considerable
foreight in planning for funda-
mental education in Haiti. Success
will not come easily there, but by
envisaging the need for anthropo-
logy from the beginning, instead
of calling in"trouble shooters"
when difficulties have arisen, one
may be assured that the pro-
gramme will rest on firm ground.
The present plans for the
Haitian programme calI for the
preparation of an anthropological
field survey of the Marbial Valley
within the first six months of
work. This is an exceedingly short
period in which to obtain a satis-
faetory understanding of any cul-
ture Nevertheless, if attention is
eoncentrated upon the most fun-
damental aspects of the society,
the survey may provide the infor-
mation necessary for the educa-
tional and extension work fore-
seen by the Pilot Project.
Haitian peasant culture should
not be regarded as a subculture or
a variety of Western culture
adapted to the tropics. Nor should
it be looked upon as a transplant-
ed African culture. It is rather,
an amalgam of European and
African traditions, from which a
new and original culture has de-
veloped. Although much 1n
Haitian life recalls both Europe
and Africa to the informed obser-
ver, nothing would be more mis-
leading than 00 regard the coun-
try people either as European
peasants or African tribesmen.
The first task of the anthropo-
logist will be 00 describe the life
of the Haitian peasants in the
Marbial Valley ; their round of
work, their relations 00 their im-
mediate and extended family, to
neighbours and ta members of
other cemmunities, their social
organisation and religious orien-
tation.
Cultural Overtones
Secondly, the anthropologist
must consider earefully the more
subtle aspects of the culture 50
that he may sense the"eidos"and
"ethos"of thé community. In tact,
a grasp of the overtones of the
culture and an understanding of
the values on which practices are
basOO undoubtedly will be of more
lasting importance for a pro-
gramme of education than the
most detailed knowledge of the
material apparatus of life.
Inevitably, in earrying out a
programme of education, institu-
tions and customs must be modifi-
ed. When this happens, since no
culture can be altered piecemal,
all of life is affeded in one way
Or another. Sanitation and schools
do not automatically bring order
and happiness to a retarded so-
ciety ; on the contrary, they may
cause temporary chaos. Yet many
of the difficulties can be met if
points of resistanee are foreseen
and if the values and the places
in the structure of institutions to
be changed and customs to be
abandoned are taken into con-
sideration.
80 armed, the prudent edueator
or reformer may draw the people
toward the desired goal by persua-
sion and with their own collabora-
tion. Educators, health and agri-
cultural experts may provoke deep
cultural change ; if the results are
to be positive and humanly valu-
able, the process must be careful-
ly controlled
In a changing culture the native
is often tempted ta despise his
cultural heritage and 00 adopt in-
discriminately the ideas and ways
brought ta him. The danger is
particularly gréât in Haiti where
the wish of more educated people
is to westernise the country as
rapidly as possible. One of the
duties of the anthropologist would
be ta point out ta his fellow work-
ers aspects of the culture which
are worth maintaining and sup-
porting. By so doing, one may
prevent a feeling of inferiority
from developing in the community
with regard to the past, and at
the same time avoid an exaggerat-
ed and superficial respect for
what is new.
Since one of the ultimate ob-
jectives of the programme will be
00 raise the standard of life in
this remote valley, and since ef-
forts in this direction can only
bear fruit when the health and
agriculture experts are informed
about present living conditions,
the anthropologieal survey will
pay close attention 00 local eco-
nomy.
The inhabitants of the Marbial
Valley, like most of the population
of Haiti, are peasants who live
from agriculture. Precise informa-
tion will be needed about land
tenure, property distribution, land
usage for different types of crops,
land valuation, etcThe second stage of the econo-
mic survey will be the establish-
ment of a seasonal rhythm of
work. An approximate schedule of
the year round activities of the
peasants will be ascertaitled 50
that agrieulturalists may better
estimate work habits and educa-
tors may be able to adapt their
programmes to the requirements
of economic life.
The third stage of the enquiry
will be the determination of the
division of labour within the fami-
ly and the community.
Severals forms of associations,
formaI and informai, are in exist-
ence among Haitian peasants
which serve for mutual help in
tasks which are beyond the conve-
nient eapacity of one man and

his family. The combite is such
a working association and deserves
rigorous study. A thorough under-
standing ôf the combite and simi-
lar organisations that may exist
will do much 00 gain the confi-
dence of the peasants and may
suggest new ways of spreading
ideas and techniques among the
population. Moreover, the as-
sistanee of combite groups will be
introduced in water distribution,
necessary whenever'buildings are
to be ereeted and improvements
sanitation and other conerete as-
pects of the programme (1).
Crafts and Skills
The programme eontemplates
the fostering of local arts and
crafts. Here again the anthro-
pologist must provide the basic
information. It has been observed
that the Haitian peasant is a jack-
of-all-trades who, in experimental
situations, has learned new skills
rapidly and proficiently. However,
the development of new skills of-
ten depend upon the extent to
which an individual can be spared
from arduous work in the fields to
provide essential food. Consequent-
ly, it is already elear that the
development of crafts and indus-
tries must go hand in hand with
improved agricultural techniques.
The Haitians are good basket
makers and wood carvers and are
better iron workers than has
been generally assumed. Some of
the iron ob. jeets found in Vodu
temples suggest that metal work-
ing, which was so developed
among the African ancestors of
the peasants, is not entirely dead
and might be revived
The diet of the Haitian peasant
is often obviously inadequate, but
unfortunately no adequate studies
have yet been made of its compo-
sition or of the peoples food
habits. In the matter of food, it
will be desirable for the health
and agricultural specialists to
work together with information
provided by the anthropologist,
since the solution of their prob-
lems are inter-dependent.
Popular Religion
If conditions in the Marbial
Valley are similar 00 those in
other parts of the country, we
may expect to find, together with
Catholiscism, a strong indigenous
religion known as Vodu, which
has ils robots in bath African and
Christian traditions. This popular
religion is vigorous and is one of
the keystones of social relations.
The Vodu priest, who may be a
man or a woman, is without ques-
tion a person of great prestige in
the community. The Vodu temple
(humfort) may be a gathering
place for a fairly large number of
people, particularly women. A
sympathetic attitude toward Vodu
and some understanding of the
functions of the temple will do
much to gain the confidence of
the peasants
Since Vodu is prlmarily concern-
ed with the physical and emo-
tional weil being of the believers,
medicine and various sorts of
treatment are closelv associated
with other magico-religious beliefs.
As often as not, the Vodu priest
is a kind of mfdieal practitioner
and the temple may serve as a
substitute for a hospital. Con-
sequently, if we wish the peasants
to adopt our viewpoint about
hygiene and to take preventive
measures to fight endemie diease,
it is vital for us to know their
own concepts of health and illness.
Experience with primitive peoples
has shown that it is a shortsight-
ed policy to fight the influence 01
the medicine man as a sheer im-
poster. Often, with guidance, he
can be turned into a valuable ally
, instead of an enemy.type fear of witchcraft is a
disturbing element in Haitian
peasant life. Some knowledge of
the factors involved will lighten
the task of educators and heaUb
experts alike
Vodu cerêmonies with their
songs and danees eontain the most
original elements of Haitian peas-
ant life. The celebration of cere-
monies provides the peasants with
almost the only entertainment
they have and is a source of pres-
tige for the best performers. In
view of the prejudices that exist
about Vodu, there is danger that
the programme of fundamental
edueation may destroy these ma--
nifestation of popular art and de-
prive the peasant of his most deep-
ly appreciated outlet from a hard
and duU life.
Unquestionably the whole prob-
lem of dealing with Vodu will be
one of the most delieate from
every point of view and it must
be met with tact and skills. A
study of popular religion will in-
dicate those aspects which could
be utilised in a programme of
education without too heavily in-
volving the sensibilities either of
more cultivated persons, 00 whom
the whole subject is anathema, or
of the peasants to whom it Is
valued way of life. Consequently
it will be necessary to find mean
of promoting tolérance and under-
standing on ale sidis
Folklore
The Haitian peasants have in-
herited from their African fore-
bears a rich folklore of tales, songs
and proverbs. They have also
adopted a large number of French
fairy tales and popular songs. In
native folklore the educators may
find abundant material for many
sorts of textbooks.
The anthropologist will endeav-
our ta make a collection of tales,
proverbs and song texts. He will
be able to collaborate in the selec-
tion of suitable texts for educa-
tional purposes, since he will be
able to judge, from his broader
knowledge of the culture, the si-
gnificanee of the stories in th",
minds of the peasants. Popular
proverbs, of course, would seem
to be especially valuable primers,
particularly for adults
Haitian folk tales are not only
engaging of themselves, they are
also full of the humour and
penetrating observation that make
the Haitian peasant a stimulating
and delightful person 00 know.

country. Since the only two exist-
ing normal schools for primary
school teachers are located near
the capital (Port-au-Prince) the bulk of the students is made up
of city-dwellers. After graduation

ier to work in the towns rather

Thus, despite the démocratie
provisions of the Constitution, pri-
mary and secondary school educa-
'Mon is usuaIly reserved for town

tively weIl to do.
The situation in the rural dis-
tricts reveals a completely diffe-, rent picture. There are no second-
:, dary schools, no technical schools.
 The only exception is a smaIl spe-'cial school in the north of the is-
land (the Chatard School), which
"can provide agricultural training
for about thirty young farmers.

The Language Problem
In spite of the tact that French

and that, as laid down in the
Constitution,"its use is compul-

plain facts of the matter are that
eighty to ninety per cent of the
Haitian population spcak and un-
derstand only Créole. Although a
diaIect of French, Creole is never-
theless quite different from the
French language.
Any programme for popular edu-
cation in Haiti must use Creole if
it is ta make contact with the
people, enlist their good will, con-
vinee them to adopt methods of
hygiene and agriculture, improve
their techniques in arts and crafts
and develop principles of good
. citizenship, ail of which are essen-
'tial if the standards of the coun-
try are te be raised.
Finally, it is important ta stress
that suitable textbooks and mo-
dern educational methods must be
employed so as 00 render more
effective the teaehing of French,
which is essentiaUy a foreign lan-
guage for the rural population of

in which men live. There is a
challenge today to every depart-
ment of every government and
rôt least tQ those departments
involved in the processes of edu-
cation. The challenge goes out
to every thinking citizen because
it is nothing less than the re-
suIt of the world's own riches,
of man's collective teehnological
advances and of the enormous
gap in their distribution and
enjoyment, the gaps that have
50 often ct1allenged-the processes
of education and have 50 often
failed to be understood by them.
Abraham Lincoln said that
"Man could not exist hait slave
and half free."Julian Huxley,
in one of his introductions re-
cently, paraphrased this and
said,"Man cannot exist hait 11-
literate and half literale,"and
he said it for the good reason
that the whole question of peace
and international understanding
depends in the lastresort on ac-
cess to the means and skills of
the modern world for whicn
people are reaching out with de-
sperate hands ; it depends on
them because you cannot hâve
peace in a world where there
are vast fields of frustration,
whether it be on the economie
or the cultural level, and where
prides are hurt by the assertions
and assumptions of some of our
Western peoples.
What the film can do for in-
ternational understanding there-
fore depends not on knowing
how to film, how 00 stand behind
a camera and turn a handle, but
on our concept of social restons.
ibility.
If we talk about the film in
international understanding, we
should thé, reforme be elear about
our purpose in this task, about
the substance of the matter, and
then the technical side will safe-
ly take eare of itself. For Unesco
the substance of the task is thé
duty of Fundamental Education.
Our Unesco work in Fun-
damental Education is only one
part of Unesco's programme and
is limited by budget. Its suceeas
must depend on national effort.
50, we arrive at the paradox
which some of us have known aIl
our lives, that internationalism
begins in the nations, and for
many of our immediate tasks, it
begins at home.
Responsibiliíies
The whole implication of Brit-
ish social history, of British social
policy and po1itical po1icy, de-
mands recognition of the fact
that we are not a nation of 50
million people today but a nation
of 113 million people, white, black
and others. Our govemmental
responsibilities are not a question
only of Grantham, Birmingham,
Leeds and Hull, but also of Nyasa-
land, Nigeria, Tanganyika and
Kenya, and of the other colonies
outside Africa.
There is another challenge. Hit-
ler, not of p ! easant memory, once
used the phrase of England's
colonies that we were allowing
"cobwebs to grow in our treasure
house.''I shall not say much

Sees Challenge in Africa
about that, except ta emphasise
that international criticism is
growing on how we use and de-
velop our work in the Colonies.
We are, in particular, challenged
from without in respect of fun-
damental éducation, and not least
by the Soviet Union where in a
period of less than twenty-five
years illiteracy has been pratically
wiped out by a plan of education
involving the use of 90 regional
languages. The examples in Mex-
ico, China and elsewhere are there
also to challenge us ta the effort
of which, 1 am sure, we are in-
creasingly conscious today.
Nor can we forget the United
Nations. With the work of the
Security Council, the F. A. O., the
W. H. O., the I. L. O. and Unesco, it
has established for the first time
in history, a world conscience in
respect of what to do not only
with health and with education,
but also, and very fundamentaUy,
what to do with the economie
resourees of the world 50 that the
world's needs can be integrated
and filled
But our most profound chal-
lenge, and the one that will have
to be, met, whether we like it or
not, comes to us from the native
peoples themselves. The achieve-

ments of our own Negro popula-
tions, for instance, and those of
the. Ameriean Negroes in various
fields of science and medicine,
éducation, music and writing, are
progressively creating a powerful
body of world opinion.
1 find in France a new group
under the title"Présence Afri-
caine,', in which the best writers
of French Africa have got togeth-
cr to produce a review of the
greaest things of note in ale fiels
of negro expression. Groups like
this represent, not only an expres-
sion of culture, but a watch on
the interests of the African in
the course of our next genera-
tion's development.
My main proposition, therefore,
is that it is not a question of
films coming from outside but of
films being created from the in-
side by and for the Colonial
peoples themselves. 1 am going to
say directly that there is now no
considerable body of knowledge in
this field. Some experiments have
been made, but in pretty piece-
meal fashion. There is no body
of knowledge, 1 think, because no
sufficient interest has been creat-
ed, no sufficient funds have been
found, and no adequate organisa-
tion has been established for the
task in hand. We start almost at
scratch.
The first necessity is that we
find a body of men who will make
this their lifework, who will spe-
cialise in this as one of the
inspiring tasks of our time, and
begin with a proper knowledge of
the colonies. It is no longer a
question of people dropping into
Africa to make a picture, to"do
something''for thé natives, as
only a generation ago, the Squire
and his lady"did something"for
us. That does not reflect the size
or nature of the problem. We
have got to ereate a body of men
who live and work with the
African problem, who are the
African problem in its creative
aspect, knowing it and living with
it. It is essentially a problem of
development on the economtc
technological, social and cultural
levels. It involves sympathy with
the cultures in the areas we are
concerned with.
Above all, we should have a
great con cers for the psychologic-
al problems involved in the mak-
ing of films in this particular
field. Here 1 quote from a letter
sent me by my friend Richard
Wright, the Negro writer of
"Bright and Morning Star"and
"Native Son."
"Undoubtediy, such an impact
of Western ideas and methods
upon African natives will mean
a disruption of their communal,
fragile, traditional, tribal and al-
most sacred institutions. MeaDS
will have to be found to enable a
smooth and aU but painless adap-
tation of these institutions to the
Western method of working and
living. Let me cite just one im-
portant psychological problem in-
volved. In Africa,. for the most
part, individual will and initiative
are almost unknown and are lar-
gely considered sinful. AU work
and endeavour are done under the
guidance of traditional ceremony.
Now, with the introduction of vast
schemes for increasing production,
one will find that individual effort
will not only be encouraged to.
come to the fore but must be
rewarded. Indeed, the instilling of
the desire for individual initiative
in Africans can be a great gift
which the Western world can
offer to people slumbering in a
kind of cosmic silence. And 1 can
tell you that this laek of indivi-
dual initiative in the Africans is
deeply regretted by most educated
Africans 1 have met ; these edu-
eated Africans know that this is
one of their great handicaps, and
if the Britißh programme can help
in this direction, it wil ! hâve made
a lasting and proud contribution
ta the peoples of Africa. What
1 mean concretely, is that Afric-
ans must be drawn into the ac-
tuaI management and policy-mak-
ing eouncils of these projected
enterprises."
These are some of the problems
and possibilities to which, 1 think,
consideration should be given. The
first of my propositions is that
the heart of the matter lies in
the subject matter ; secondly, that
appropriate machinery should be
created : (a) in the form of a
School of the Colonies ; (b) in the
development of the Colonial Film
Unit with true regard for decen-
tralisation and the part which
natives will play in it ; (e) in the
form of an African School of
Film Experiment.
These tasks seem to me not just
minor tasks for Britain today but
priority tasks and among the most
privileged which face the present
generation of British men and
women.
1 conclude in the dark voiee of
Richard Wright and not in my
own white one.
"I feel this will be the first
time that a collective and scien-
tific effort has been made by
Western civilisation 00 meet the
needs of colonial people. One need
mot be at aIl ashamed that the
motives which are spurring the
British are those of self-interest ;
indeed, such motives, in my on.
nion, can guarantee objectivity
and rationality, and help rule out
irrational racial fears on bath
sides. Such a project can be made
into a model of colonial engineer-
ing for ail other nations to emu-
late... 1 think that such a pro-
gramme will be one of the big
stories of the word."
At a recent meeting of the
Royal Empire Society in Lon-
don, Mr. J. Grierson, Head of
Unesco's Mass Communication
and Public Information Sec-
tions, delivered the address re-
produced above in abridged
form.
Mr. Gr : rson was recently
named Controller at the Cen-
tral Office of Information of
the British Government and
will leave Unesco on April 30.
He is credited with creating
the word"documentary"and
has been described as the
"main driving force and inspi-
ration of the realist film move-
ment".
Mr. Grierson was the found-
er of the first British Govern-
ment film services and was
later associated with the crea-
tion of the Government film
services of New Zealand, Aus-
tralia and Canada.

A MODERN NECESSITY :
Popular Science
By Borge Michel8en
THE existing relations betweenscience and the puhlic in
many coui1tries can still be sum-
med up in the anecdote used by
Lord Raleigh a decade ago lately
retond by R. W. Gerard in
"Science".
The great Australian transcon-
tinental railway had been com-
pletad, and the first train was
being dispatched at a gala cere-
mony. At the elimatie moment,
the passengers waved, the crowd
cheered, the signal was given, and
the locomotive proudly started off
-leaving the train standing.
Someone had forgotten to cou-
ple the en2'ine to the cars.

there is in the world today a

Science in its nature 1s inter-
national. That is to say scientific
discoveries and their practical
applications, no matter where
they are originally made. can be
transferred quiclslly and eobno-
mieally to al reas where there
is a stable and effective godera-
ment :.
During the war a science writer
m an occupied country discovered
that scientists in Switzerland
were experimenting with DDT as
an insecticide. He. wrote an article
about it and the day after it
appeared in his paper the first
manufacture of DDT was started
in his country.
Every science writer can tell
about instances like this.
Through their articles they are
stimulating industry and agricul-
ture to make still more use or
more adequate use of science.
As to the importance of popu-

One of the reasons that so

Populari : lation of Science

1 should like to eonelude by
quoting the answer which another
scientist, James B. Conant, Pre-
sident of Harvard University (in
his book"On Understanding
Science") has given to the ques-
tion : Why popularise science ?
Because of the tact. says
Conant, that the applications of
science play so important a part
in our daily lives, matters of pu-
blic policy are profoundly in-
fluenced by higWy technical con-
sidérations. Some understanding
of science bV those in tMSitions of
authority and responsibility as
well as by those who shape opi-
nion is therefore of importance
for ttle national welfare."
Such a statement made a de-
cade ago might hâve seemed a
presumptuous ctaim. Today, with
the as yet unsolved riddle of in-
ternational contraI of atornie
energy hanging omlnously above
us, such a ôtatement may seem
50 obvious as to require no elabo-
ration.
SCIENCE ABSTRACT
EXPERTS TO MEtl
! M PARtS
A Committee cf eleven ExPerts
will meet in Unesco House on 7,
8 and 9 April, to advise Unesco on
lines of. action for the improv-
ment ana development of abstracts-
ing services for the natural scien-
ces. Brief summaries, or abstracts
as they are called, of scientific
articles form the principal means
by which scientits are informed
of the latest developments in
science.
Before the war it was estimated
that three quarters of a million
useful scientific articles were
published each year, and about
the same number of abstracts.
However, these abstracts dealt on-
ly with a quarter of a million
articles. In other words, two
thirds of the scientific articles
published are not abstracted at
ail, while the remaining third of
the articles are abstracted on the
average three times.
Unesco eonsiders that this situ-
ation is unsatisfactory, and is ask-
ing the advice of the Commit tee 1
of Experts in an effort 00 remedy 1
it.
The eleven experts wlll came
from six countries, and will repre-
sent six abstracting services. Mn3t
of the experts are qualified scien-
tists drawn from five major fields
of science. Librarians will also be
represented. A report on the
results of this meeting will be
published in the May issue of the
Unesco Courier.

latter part of the century, a net-
work of non-governmental inter-
national organisations has de-
veloped, uniting across frontiers
educators, scientists and artists
concerned with international co-
operation.
Long before the establishment
of inter-governmental organisa-
tions for this purpose, these or-
ganisations promoted cultural ex-
changes and contributed to the
advancement of knowledge as
weil as to the furtherance of
mutua ! understanding among the
peoples of the world. Tu-ray they
continue to constitute a powerful
force towards this end, and many
of them can contribute effective.-
ly towards the achievement of
Unesco's major objectives.
Experienee has shown that one
important method by which
Unesco can further the develop-
ment of non-governmental inter-
national organisations whose
activities it considers of impor-
tance for the achievement of its
own purposes, is that of extend-
ing financial support to them in
the form of grants-in-aid.
Such financial support is of
particular importance in the pre-
sent economic and financial si-
tuation of the world. Sources of
income have been greatly affect-
ed as a resuIt of the war ; for one
thing the general impoverishment
and the inflationary process tak-
ing place in many countries have
particularly affected the social
groups which have traditionally
contribu'ted to educational and
cultural associations. In addition,
the currency restrictions imposed
in many countries prevent the
free circulation across frontiers
of the funds which might be
made available for the financing
of non-governmental interna-
tional organisations.
Thus, the continuation of many
activities for which non-govern-
mental international organisa-
tions were responsible in the past,
is to-day threatened. Their future
may well depend upon how far
Unesco will be able to aid them
financially.

Dr. NEEDHAM
Recalled 10 Cambridge
AFTER two years'p ! oneer workas first Head of Unesco's Na-
tural Science Section, Dr. Joseph
Needham, F. R. S., will leave Unes-
co on April 20 00 resume his work
at Cambridge University.
In an interview Dr. Needham
stressed the importance of co-
operation on an international
scale by scientists no less than
educators and intellectuals and
pointed out that"more than ever
before, there is need of faith and
support for the United Nations."
"The United Nations", he sa : d,
"Unesco, the World Health Orga-
nisation, and the Food and Agri-
culture Organisation must have
our active support for they are in
a sense an embryo, a pilot plant
of ultimate world governments".
Dr,. Needham adde<i. that be
much regretted having to leave
an international organisation be-
cause of his recaU ta Cambridge.
"I have always had the conviction
of being an international citizen.
l intend to come back to Unesco
often to lend a hand in whatever
way 1 can to the W'ork of the
Organisation", he said.
Born in London in 1900, Dr.
Needham studied biochemistry at
Cambridge University, where he
was la ter appointed Sir William
Dunn Reader in that subject.
From 1. 942 to 1946 he was Head
of the British Scientific Mission
in China and Counsellor at the
British Embassy, Chungking. As
Director of the Sino-British
Science Co-operation Office, Dr.
Needham worked 00 assure ade-
quate liaison between Chinese
scientists and technologistes and
their colleagues in the West. His
knowledge of the Chinese lan-
guage was of great advantage in
this work.
In 1944, Dr. Needham wrote and
eirculated a"Memorandum on an
International Science Co-operation
Service", callinfl for the promotion
of scientific co-operation, the col-
lection and dissemination of scien-
tific information, the facilitation
of the movement 0 (scientists
across. natidflal boundaries and
the provision of scientific assis-
tance to aIl other international
organisations.
During a visit to Washingoton in
1945 he partieipated in the plans
under way for UNE-CO". Dr
Needham discussed the inclusion
of science in the new organisations
both with American scientists and
government officiais. These ideas
were eirculated in various coun-
tries and found wide support.
They ultimately heloped to bring
about the incorporation of the
Natural Sciences in"UNE-< : : O" sc
as to form the present UNESCO.
Dr. Needham is the author of
a number of books on scientific
and philosophieal questions, the
two most important of which are
"Chemical Embryology" (3 vols.,
1931) and"Biochemistry and
Morphogenesis" (1942).
"Science Outpost", a new book
to appear in September, is a
compilation of articles, reports.
letters and travel journals on the
works of Chinese scientists and
engineers during the war. Dr.
Needham is now at work on a
study of the history of science
and technologv in the Far East.
to be called"Science and Civili-
sation in China".
In the field of international
scientific services, Unesco is con-
tributing-as it did last year-to
the activities of : (1) Internatio-
nal Time Bureau (Paris), (2) In-
ternational Latitude Service (Ca-
podimonte), (3) International
Bureau of Isostatic Reductions
(Helsinki), (4) International Seis-
mological Summary (Cambridge).
(5) International Commission on
Zoologieal Nomenclature (Lon-
don), (6) International Commis-
sion on Botanieal Nomenclature
(Harvard) and (7) International
Centre of Documentation on
Optics (Paris). In addition, Unes-
co will contribute, this year,, to
the international comparison of
standard geomagnetie instru-
ments.
The following well-known in-
ternational laboratories will re-
ceive financial assistance this
year-as they did in 1947 : (1)
International High Altitude Re-
search Station (Jungfraujoch),
(2) International Zoological Sta-
tion (Naples), and (3) Marine
Biological Station (Roscoff).
The International Centre of
Type-Culture Collections (Lau-
sanne) will receive this year-as
it did in 1947-a relatively sub-
stantial grant to be distributed
to 18 bacteriological and myco-
logieal type-culture labaratories
on five continents : : l in NOrth
America. 1 in South America, 2
in Asia, 2 in Australia and 11 in
Europe.
In the field of publications, the
following scientific periodicals
sponsored by the International
Unions of Crystallography, Scien-
tific Radio, Biological Sciences
and History of Science, will be
given partial financial assistance :
(1) Acta Crystallographica &
Structure Reports, (2) Monthly
Bulletin of the International
Union of Scientific Radio, (3)
ResuJnptio Genetica, (4) BioloA'i-
ca. l Abstracts,, (5) Biologie, (6)
Zoological Records and (7) Archi-
ves-Internationales d'Histoire des
Sciences. The report of the Gen-
eral Assemblies of 4 Unions (1)
Astronome, (2) Scientific Radio,' (3) Geodesy & Geophysics and
(4) Theoretical & Applied Mecha-
nics, and of 3 International Con-
gresses (1) Genetics, (2) Zoology,
and (3) Entomology, íWill be print-
ed with partial subventions from
Unesco. Unesco also contributes
a part of the cost of some 20
other publications of the Coun-
cil and of 7 of its 10 federated
Unions.
In 1948 Unesco grants 00 Unions
will contribute in part to the
transportation expenses of the
officiais of 5 Unions who will at-
tend their respective statutory
General Assembles. of the offi-
ciaLs óf the International Geo-
participants in the International
the International Congress of
Geography at Lisbon, of selected
praticipants in the International
Congresses of Genettes, Zoology
Entomology and Mental Health,
and of selected participants in the
General Assemblies of the Unions
of Astronomy and Geodesy and
Geophysics.
In the seleetion of these par-
ticipants, the Unions are required
to given preferenee to scientists
from war-àevastated countries and
00 young scientists. Altogether. 8
or 7 symposia on specific scienti-
fic problems, such as thermody-
namics, physics of metals, macro-
molecular chemistry, interaction
between eggs and sperms in ani-
mal reproduction, etc., are being
organised by the Unions of
Physics, Chemistry and Biological
Sciences with subventions from

UNESCO COURIER
Unesco To Use Music
As Weapon For Peace
lN UNESCO'S programme ofaction music ils include as one
of the"weapons"to"disarnl"
men's minds. The Congress of
Vienna, in its day, also made
much use of music, but for dif-
ferent purpose, Perhaps they did
not know in 1814 that music js a
force which can unite mankind.
Or perhaps they forgot it, ail those
princes who danced, crowded the
boxes at the opera and intrigued

together, their ears filled with
sweet melody or whirling to the
rhythm of palace bands. To-day
the attitude towards the social
influence of the Arts has been
greatly modified. In many coun-
tries-democracies and totalitarian
lands alike-recourse has been
had to music for ends trans-
cending the boundaries of pure
art. In Brazil (to quote an
example familiar to me), the
teaehing of music in the public
schools of the Federal District
comes under the Division of
Patriotic Education. Art is ex-
pressly put to the service of na-
tional sentiment ; for the school
administration it is a means of
securing speeific results which
have nothing in common with the
disinterested enjoyment of an
aesthetic pleasure.
Under these circumstances,
could Unesco fait to use such a
weapon in the field of interna-
tional cultural relationships ? Ob-
viously not,, and, if we glance
through the programmes, ta be
carried out in 1948, as prescribed
by resolutions of the Mexico Con-
férence, we shall note that music
has its part therein.
Musie, obviousiy has an im-
portant place in study of Art in
General Education. The impor-
tance of musical education in
primary and secondary teaehing ;
the musical organisation of uni-
versity life ; the training of spe-
cialised music-teachers for the
schools are all problems which
Unesco must study, if it is to make
use, through the student body, of
this great force, the roots of
which are sunk 50 deeply in
human society. Concrete proposais
to this end will have to be sub-
mitted ta the governments of
Member States before the Third
General Conference and to the
latter for final considération.
Fina ! ! y, it will be for Unesco
during 1948 00 promote the
necessary consultations and agree-
ments for the establishment of an
International 111stltute of Music,
for which a scheme is 00 be sub-
mitted to the next Conference at
Beirut. i
In addition ta these three major
projects, of which one is entirely
devoted 00 music, and the other
two, partly, music has its share in
the routine activities of Unesco.
The musicals specialists of the Or-
ganisation are at the disposai of
institutions, of creative or exécu-
tant artists, teachers and musico-
logists from every part of the
world as a source of information
and co-operation in all matters,
wherever and whenever possible.
An effective programme of colla-
boration in the field of music au
part of a wider programme of
cultural and spiritual collabora-
tion, directed towards interna-
tional understanding, is only
possible as a result of continuous
contacts between the centre ins-
tigating that programme-in this
case the Arts and Letters work
of Unesco--and the bodies or in-
dividuals who are qualified ta
participate in it or who are 00 be
influenced by it.
A project now in hand in Brazil,
promoted by the Brazilian Insti-
tute for Education, Science and
Culture (IBECC), the National
Commission of Unesco, may serve
as thè model of a concrete pro-
gramme of coopération between
the Organisation and Member
States.
The Brazilian Institute has
dedded that every yoor it would
have a certain number of Brazi-
lian orchestral compositions co-
pied with'a ViEW ta their per-
formance abroad. The copies will
be made on paper suitable fer
reproduction, thus permitting the
printing of new copies of scores
and duplication of orchestral
parts at minimum cost. Suppose
that one of these copies is for-
warded to Unesco and that other
countries follow the example and
in their turn send us copies of the
musical works most représentative
of their modern composers. We
should thus co]]ect a repertoire
steadily fed by new works, which
would be at the disposai of broad-
casting stations, symphony or-
chestras and musical societies in
every country.
1 know from long expérience.
that many such bodies would be 1
glad of a chance to play t. hé
works of composers whose music
cannot ordinarily be obtained
commercially, never having been
published or put in the hanès of
a body competent to ensure its
distribution even in manuscripf.
In my view the suggested scheme
would be most welcome in this
quarter. Composers, provided their
royalties on performance are
safeguarded, which is a matter in
the province of composers'so-
cieties, have every reason ta
welcome such a project, Unesco
would in this way give real help
to young composers or composers
unknown outside their own coun-
tries.
le seems to me that this ex am.
ple of Brazil points the way ta
wider action ta be put in hand in
the future and after the necessary
study by Unesco. Heitor villa-
Lobos, the distinguished composer,
whose work needs no such help,
since it is already sure of being
spread throughout the world, ori-
ginated this proposai, and it has
been approved by the Brazilian
Institute for Education, Science
and Culture.
Should Unesco take advalltage
of the idea by widening the scope
and fitting it into an interna-
tional scheme, it may meet a need
of artists aU over the world bv
the embodiment of that need in
a project which has a ! ready been
adopted by a National Com-
mission.

  Unesco Surveys
University Problems
lN preparation for the Confer-ence of University authorities
ifrom all over the world to be
held during the Summer of this
year, Unesco has invited its them-
ber states to submit reports on
the principal problems which
they encounter at present in the
field of higher éducation.
A preliminary survey. carried
out by the Education Section of
Unesco. shows a notable measure
of agreement as 00 what these
problems are ; first of aU there is
Qn increase in the number of
university students since the end
of thé. war. The selection oî stu-
dents best able to profit by higher
education and the finding of
sufficient professors ta provide it
presents thé greatest difficulty ;
Qttempts to hold the balance in
the development of the different
faculties is disturbed by pressure
from outside forces whether offi-
tial or unofficial.
As the university population
increases a new problem arises ;
hitherto a university education
bas been made available to an
elite-whether of monEW or of
brains. Now, the tendency is to
make available higher education
to everybody desirous of it-with
8. corresponding increase in the
size of classes. etc.. which may
reduce standards of quality.
Another recent change has
been that in the connection bet-
tween General or academic educa-
xion and technical pr professional
training,
In Unesco's survey it is observ-
ed that :
"Historioally. the function of
the universities has been to pro-
vide a libéral, or literary or
humanistic education. With the
iinereasing specialisation. tYipical
of the modern world, there has
been super-imposed upon this
old and aecepted idéal, a demand
for the provision of personnel
with spedal skills, to be acquired
lin advanced courses... the prob-
item as it now appears is whether
the apparient clash between old-
established and accepted ideals,
and the dernands coming from
the industrial and economic world
for special forms of skill, can be
reconciled. In what can one
attempt to combine the virtues
of the old liberal edueation with
the requirements of economic life
in the world of to-day ?"
The intervention Of the state
or private bodies in university
lUe affects, and will affect still
further the traditional autonomy
and freedom from state authority
Òf the universities themselves ;
apart from what may be con-
sidered the first priorities of
universities from the point òf
viaw of output of trained men
Qnd women, the rapid growth of
the universities involves a situa-
tion in which the state is increas-
ingly called upon to help them
universities eXipand, :
"lu doing SO"Unesco points
out"it naturally claims a certain 1
measure of control over the ex-
penditure of the funds allocat-
eu."
"In some countries, private
sources, such as wealthy indivi-
duals or great industrial corpora-
tions, support or subsidise certain
schools of the university, or cer-
tain subjects. To some extent,
the University's policy is thereby
affeted, since developments take
place, not in thé light of an aca-
demically agreed policy, but
rather in response to pressures
or opportunités emanating from
outside. Specifically, the problems
arising here have to do with the
methods by which university
activities are financed, and the
methods by which the adminis-
tration détermines expenditures.
The practiees in operation in va-
riol1ß parts of thé, world vary
from full specific control of the
university by the state, through
the much less rigid methods used
in France, through the ingenious
mechanism of the University
Grants Committee in the United
Kingdom to the methods used in
the private universities found in
the United States.
"In this cOIDJPlicated area of
university development, the de-
sirability, from the point of view
of public policy, of a balance
between public support and auto-
nomy in university governance
becomes a central issue. Is it
possible to combine increasing
amounts of public support with
a legitimate degree of university
autonomy ? Answers to this ques-
tion are related to the very basis
of the role of the university in
the modern worid."
International
Universities
Bureau Discussed
About 100 university teachers
and professors from 22 nations
met in Paris between March 31
and April 3 to discuss the creation
of an : international Universities
Bureau, the foundation of a World
University, the problem of equiva-
lence of degrees and diplol11as
and the contribution which the
universities of the world can
make to better democratie citi-
zenship.
The Conference was sponsored
'by the International Association
of University Professors and Lec-
turers. Unesco was represented by
Professor J. A. Lauwerys, consul-
tant in éducation. Unesco is
encouraging the Iwork of this or-
ganisation and has granted it a
suooidy to study the problems of
equivalence of degrees and school-
grading Systems. The I. A. U. P. L.
will prepare a report for Unesco
on these questions.

BfMii), March 17, 1948.
From an article entitled"Brazil
and the Hylean Amazon" :
"in an interview granted bll Dr.
Corner to the"Correio da Manha",
Dr. Corner has idenlified himself
so closely with the project tha ! he
seems more Brazilian than En-
glish ; so great is the interest and
devotion he has shown in the
success of this enterprise. The
measured, jUdicious words of Sr.
Corner should be carefully coin-
sidered by the pUblic authoriries
of Brazil,
"The Hylean Amazon can be-
come a subject of popular interest.
If this is ta be achieved the
project must be dejined as what
it really is : a boom for Brazilian
science. The studies of the Insti-
tUte will be highly advantageous
for Brazil, We must have done,
therefore, with th indifference
which is noticeable in certain ins-
tances concerning this project ini-
tiated by the famed Brazilian
scientist Paulo Carneiro."
