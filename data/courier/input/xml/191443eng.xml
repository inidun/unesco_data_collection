Inequality costs lives
International Women’s Day was first honoured one hundred years ago in a
handful of European countries. Since then, the celebration has become global,
and much has been achieved. The 2011 International Women’s Day is an
opportunity to celebrate achievements and mobilize against the challenges
that remain. 
There is no room for complacency. Less than 40 percent of countries
provide girls and boys with equal access to education. Had we reached gender
parity in primary education in 2008, there would have been an additional 3.6
million girls in school. Disparities have increased at the secondary level in
Africa over the last decade. Only 29 percent of researchers in the world today
are women. Two-thirds of the world’s 796 million illiterate adults are women. 
The impact is serious. Inequality costs lives in terms of child mortality. It
blights lives in terms of poverty and marginalization. And it slights lives in
terms of opportunities for growth and development. 
Gender equality is a red thread weaving through all UNESCO activities to
promote international cooperation in education, the sciences, culture,
communication and information. We seek to promote basic human rights in
order to transform our societies and lay the foundations for equitable and
sustainable human development. 
This year’s International Women’s Day is inspired by the theme of ‘Equal
access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work
for women.’ This goes to the heart of UNESCO’s mission. We work to strengthen
the bridges between education, training, science and technology and the
labour market in order to promote equal opportunity to decent employment.
This starts early, with quality education for all girls and young women from the
primary to the tertiary level. It continues with vocational training and
education for women who have not acquired basic skills. It proceeds with
creating positive role models and career tracks – especially in such areas as
science and technology.

A matter of
commitment
Making sure we do not forget Haiti’s situation of crisis and
vulnerability – this is the primary mission of Michaëlle
Jean, former Governor General of Canada, recently
designated UNESCO Special Envoy for Haiti. Here we trace
the trajectory of an exceptional woman, who has inherited
the courage, perseverance, pragmatism and sense of
commitment of the women of Haiti.  
Interview with Michaëlle Jean by Katerina Markelova
How does a Haitian woman immigrant
become governor-general of Canada?   
And, to top it all, with responsibilities as
Head of State and Commander-in-Chief
of the armed forces! (laughs) I think it’s
first and foremost a matter of
commitment. In Haiti I learned
something very valuable – never remain
indifferent! In a country where
indifference has been responsible for
some terrible problems, my parents
always encouraged me to look around
me, to develop a point of view and to
act. I have inherited my courage,
perseverance, pragmatism and sense of
commitment from the women of Haiti.  
When I first arrived in Canada as a
child, I quickly understood that
integration meant participation. Very
early on I started to become involved 
in the women’s movement in Quebec,
particularly by setting up a network of
emergency refuges for battered women
and their children. That set me on the
path of active and responsible
citizenship.  
That experience also brought me
into journalism – 18 years in public
television! Television journalists often
find themselves moving into
entertainment programmes, if they
have the kind of look that stands out.
But I was quickly assigned to the news
service – in a newsroom, anchorwoman,
head of broadcasting, and in front of the
cameras.
Canada is the embodiment of
diversity. For us, diversity is a reality,
rooted in daily life. And, rather than see
it as a threat, we see it as a valuable
asset, despite all the challenges that go
with it. Whenever I have been the victim
of discrimination or racism – because no
society is sheltered from these kinds of
aberration – I always found plenty of
people to support me, and resources
and organisations that would stand up
and, collectively, say “No! Not in Canada.
That’s not acceptable!” That is why a
black woman, militant feminist to boot,
and a former political refugee, was able
to become Governor-general of Canada.
What are your priorities as UNESCO
special envoy for Haiti ?
First of all, to make sure that we keep in
mind the state of emergency and
vulnerability of this country. Haiti was
on the agenda of all the missions I have
been on around the world, as Governor
General of Canada. Whether in the West,
in Latin America or Africa, I have always
sensed the desire to be part of a pact of
solidarity for Haiti. Given that the
ground has already been prepared, I
now intend to ask them for support.
Haiti cannot get out of this alone. It’s a
disastrous situation! But, at the same
time, Haiti must also accept its share 
of responsibility. 
I think that the entire world is
watching what is happening in Haiti.
How will the international community
respond? Will the Haitian people – and
the Haitian state in particular – act
responsibly? We have to succeed and
send a message of hope to all of
humanity. Haiti is beset with
emergencies and miseries of every kind.
But it is still possible to act. On one
condition – to make sure the citizens are
included. 
I usually say that, in Haiti, life and
survival both depend on hope. This
country has always been able to pick
itself up after being knocked down. It
triumphed over barbarity through the
Revolution and escaped slavery by
enfranchisement. But hope took a real
body blow with the earthquake.
We often hear about Haitians’
capacity for resilience. But I would prefer

that they were known for their
creativity, their thinking and what they
have to say. If we look only at their
capacity for resilience, we will end up
believing that these people can carry on
waiting, because they are so good at
holding on in the worst circumstances.
What do you think is the role of women
in rebuilding Haiti?
When I went to Haiti in March 2010, I
deliberately chose 8 March,
International Women’s Day, to go back.
The women of Haiti needed to hear
someone saying that reconstruction
would fail unless they were involved. It
was truly amazing, amid this scene of
total devastation, where it was almost
impossible to go anywhere, to see 5000
women turn out to tell me how much
they wanted to see life triumph over 
this disaster. 
The women’s movement in Haiti is
extremely well organized. Some leading
women who helped to set up the
movement across the country lost their
lives, including some very close friends.
All of those who survived were in
mourning. But they were possessed by a
limitless energy, determined to make
sure life wins in the end! 
And what part can the diaspora play? 
The diaspora has had to overcome a
number of challenges, and this is not
the first time that Haiti has had to face
difficulties. When the Duvaliers1 left, in
1986, everyone hoped for great things.
We saw ex-patriots selling up and
moving back home. Men, women and
children wanted to contribute to the
renaissance of Haiti, to the construction
of a democratic state and to new
governance. At that time people were
already speaking of refounding,
reconstruction, a new start. But it turned
out to be a minefield. A series of coups
and the army’s straitjacket stifled any
hope there had been. After a fleeting
moment of euphoria, life became
painful for Haitians for a long time.   
When the hurricanes struck in 2008
[taking the lives of nearly 1000 people], 
I saw a bad sign – the diaspora did not
respond. Oh, how terrible it was to see
that! In fact, Haitians living abroad had
been disappointed by the behaviour of
their compatriots in the previous years –
the aid they had been sending home lay
rotting in containers or was
appropriated by corrupt officials.  
But the 2010 earthquake touched
the hearts and minds of everybody! The
diaspora pulled itself together and
responded this time. As I speak to you
now, people are struggling to join in this
stage in the country’s development,
which could be a turning point. People
have said it before me – this disaster has
to become an opportunity to act! 
On your visit to Haiti in March 2010,
you emphasized the importance of
education. It was during a round table
discussion in Port-au-Prince that you
chaired alongside the Director-General
of UNESCO. What do expect to do in
this area?
Haiti is a country where it is possible to
do a great deal in terms of education.
Why? Because, in the very fabric of Haiti,
in its culture, in the Haitian way of
being, in its history, education has
always been synonymous with
emancipation and access to freedom. In
the plantations, the slaves remained
illiterate. But there was also another
category of people – the children that
the masters had with their slaves. These
children were not sent to the
plantations and were taught to read and
write. These ‘domestic slaves’ as they
were called, had access to knowledge.
Some even went as far to show off their
talents. And the plantation slaves saw all
of this.
Today, when you see little Haitians
going to school, you cannot imagine the
dreadful circumstances they are being
forced to live in! But when they go off to
school they are always pampered, they
are beautiful, they are proud and their
parents are proud, too. 
All these families, even the poorest,
bend over backwards to send their
children to school! So the conditions are
very favourable. If we invest in
education, if we help Haiti to build a
quality public education system, the
people will immediately take it on board
as something great and useful.
At the present moment, there is an
incredible number of scattered
educational projects, but there is no
coordination. I think that UNESCO has
all the necessary skills to play a
leadership role in this area and to help
the Haitian State to create a standard
framework for schools. 
Michaëlle Jean, was born in 1957 in Port-
au-Prince (Haiti), and sought exile with her
family in Canada in 1968, fleeing the
dictatorship of François Duvalier. After a long
career in journalism (the French network of
Radio-Canada and the English network of
CBC Newsworld) and militating for women’s
rights, Michaëlle Jean became governor
general of Canada (September 2005 –
September 2010). On 8 November 2010, she
was designated UNESCO Special Envoy for
Haiti. With her husband, the filmmaker Jean-
Daniel Lafond, Michaëlle Jean chairs a
foundation that bears her name, focused on
youth and the arts.

In the Arab region, the debate on
women’s rights is currently focused on
the reform of family law. Indeed, in the
name of an Islam raised to the rank of
State religion, modern laws accord a
lower status to women than to men.
From the Middle East to North Africa a
normative system has been constructed
around women – and women in
particular – that is subordinate to Sharia
law or the fiqh [Islamic law and
jurisprudence] and which, in a variety of
forms, legitimizes a whole range of
amalgams, such as between religion and
political affiliation, political
commandment and the application of
Sharia law, marriage and religious
endogamy, etc. 
Family law cements the links
between religious and political orders,
turning the family into a citadel of male
domination. One only has to look at the
rules on marriage, which include
matrimonial subjugation, a ban on
unions between Muslims and non-
Muslims, and relationships between
marriage partners based on a duty of
maintenance, giving men the
predominant role. And then there are
Rights won, 
To understand the obstacles that block the path to women’s emancipation in Arab countries,
including Tunisia, where they have had the vote since 1957, the lawyer Sana Ben Achour
delves into family law. She exposes the pretence of the State’s endorsement of feminism,
which falls far short of meeting the exigencies of gender equality and indivisible rights.

the rules of descent and kinship, which
are based on patrilineal genealogy and
also apply to laws on nationality – a
woman cannot pass on her nationality
to her husband or children. 
Of the 22 members of the League of
Arab States, 16 signed the Convention
on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination against Women in 1981.
However, they have nearly all voiced
substantial reservations, whether
specific or general, regarding one
measure or another in the text. It is thus
easy to understand that the feminist
movements that emerged in the 1980s
rallied around public policy issues to

protest against institutionalized
discrimination and the differences
between universal human rights and
national laws.
Hostages of the political regime
It is interesting to note that economic,
social and cultural reforms have been
initiated by authoritarian governments –
often the offspring of national liberation
movements – exploiting family relations
as leverage for their national politics. As a
result, civil codes regarding the individual
and the family, although they derive their
origins from classic Muslim law, are part
of a legislative policy that signals a certain
conquest of modern legislative reason.
This was the case for the Egyptian laws of
1917, 1920 and 1929, then laws on
personal status in Jordan (1951 and
1976), Syria (1953), Tunisia (1956),
Morocco (1957-1958) and Iraq (1959).
Other countries recently rallied behind
this model: Algeria and Kuwait in 1984
and, nearer home, Mauritania in 2001. In
all of these cases, the reforms led to
changes in the law and a restructuring of
Islamic normative code around women.
This is because what is at stake is siyassa
tachrîya (“the making of a legislative
policy”), taking account of the need for
arbitration between the principles of the
organisation of identity and civil society’s
demands for equality. It is precisely for
this reason that the law on personal and
family status oscillates between the spirit
of tradition and the spirit of innovation. 
Furthermore, not one of these
policies has been implemented without
authoritarian intervention by central
government – such as decrees from the
Head of State (as in Tunisia, under the
presidency of Habib Bourguiba),
regulations arising from a state of
emergency (as in Egypt under President
Anwar El Sadat) or dhahir of the King (as
in Morocco). Almost everywhere, they
have been accompanied by the
establishment of National Women’s
Unions, satellite women’s organizations,
heavily embedded within the State
apparatus and the party in power. And
these organizations serve as a conduit to
disseminate social policy regarding
maternal and child health, education and
literacy, rural planning and development,
the popularization of new laws on
personal and family status. These forms of
“State feminism” ended up by taking
women hostage and using them as a
shield of stability for political regimes.
Maintaining the status quo
Today, in countries that have been taken
over by Islamist movements and appeals
for conformity, these texts, marred by a
lack of democracy, still seem to have
only a precarious hold. They may be
called into question at any moment, as
was the case in Egypt with the Jihan law
of 1979 (named after Sadat’s wife), which
allowed a woman to obtain a divorce
automatically during the year after her
husband’s second marriage. This law was
revoked in 1985, under the new article 2
of the Constitution that made Islamic
law the principle source of legislation. It
was the same in Tunisia when President
Bourguiba was deposed in 1987 and
there were increasing threats of a “return
to origins”. Once again the tutelary
intervention of top State authorities was
required to ensure that the law on
personal status was not touched, that its
In December 2008, Sana Ben Achour
was elected president of the Tunisian
association of women democrats (ATFD),
whose main objective is the adoption of
universal values of gender equality,
human rights and fundamental
freedoms, as well as campaigning for the
financial and social rights of women.

Faculty of legal, political and social
sciences of Tunis, Sana Ben Achour is also

Human Rights (LTDH).
principles became an accepted national
fact, and to come down hard on the
Islamist movement – once it had been
‘normalized’ – and, while they were at it,
on the democrats too. 
In other words, behind the scenes of
these legislative policies on the family,
not only the reform of traditional law is
at stake, but maintaining the status quo.
Any questioning of the traditional
asymmetry between the rights of men
and the rights of women would be a
threat to established public order. And
those in power permanently renew this
asymmetry when they grant legal
guarantees to women without ever
letting go of male superiority. And it is
upon this arbitration that the reform of
patriarchal consensus draws. If an
example were needed, it would be
Tunisia, because, in the wider landscape
of family law in Islamic countries, it is
undoubtedly the country that has gone
furthest in terms of transgressing
against holy law – divorce by mutual
consent legalized as early as 1956, the
right to vote for women in 1957,
legalized abortion from 1962… But, like
the other countries, it has not been able
to halt male privilege. Which means the
husband as head of the family, the
continued practice of the dowry – even
if it is just a symbolic dinar – as a
condition for marriage, the two-
thirds/one-third rule in favour of males
for dividing an inheritance, etc. Under
these conditions, one can measure the
gulf that separates the words of
politicians on reforms of the law on
individual status or improvements in
family law from the demands of
feminists regarding women’s
independence, and equal and
indivisible rights. 

At 55, you have already spent over four
decades fighting all forms of
discrimination, especially against
women. Where did this militant spirit
come from?
I am a born rebel! The social context and
my family environment only
accentuated this aspect of my character.
I took my first steps as a left-wing
militant at the age of 11. I was living in
the southwest of Nouakchott, the
capital of Mauritania, in a National
Democratic Movement stronghold. This
Marxist movement was calling for
economic and social emancipation,
while contesting the single-party rule of
President Ould Daddah. So, I got many
of my ideas after hearing them in the
streets or from friends or at school. I
read a lot – on the resistance of
Vietnamese women, the Bolshevik
revolution and especially the Commune.
I even got nicknamed “Commune de
Paris”! This ideal of the liberation of the
people and equality was in radical
contrast with the old-fashioned ideas
and feudal spirit that prevailed in my
family. We were rich, we had slaves, and
my father ruled as absolute patriarch.
He beat me and chained me up
whenever I stayed out of school to join
demonstrations or hand out leaflets. All
that cost me several stays in prison,
from the age of 12. I was soon let out,
because I was young, but the worst
punishments were handed out at home.
That only served to turn my
spontaneous commitment into
unshakeable convictions. Since then I
have been fighting relentlessly for
equality between men and women, for
an end to slavery and for human rights.
Your commitment goes back a long
way, but you have only recently set up
your Single Mothers Association
(AFCF). What sparked that? 
For years I have been a member of a
number of organizations, like the
Comité de solidarité aux veuves
In Mauritania, the question of slavery is closely linked to
women because, traditionally, slave status was hereditary and
passed on by the mother. Since 2007, slavery has been a crime
under Mauritanian law. But, in practice, it continues in more or
less disguised forms while the perpetrators escape
prosecution. Lawyer Aminetou Mint El Moctar has devoted her
life to the rights of women, especially single mothers.

been married to a friend of my father. I
was 13 years old. 
Also, when inheritances are divided
up, two-thirds go to the boys, one third
to the girls, while only the husband can
initiate a divorce. Mauritania signed the
Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW), but added two reservations,
precisely on divorce and inheritance.
AFCF is currently campaigning to get
these two reservations lifted. It is by
inscribing equality between men and
women in the law that we will acquire
the weapons to combat concrete acts of
discrimination, even if this is just the
first step because many laws are not
applied.
This is particularly true of the 2007 law
that makes slavery a criminal offence.
You often point out that no one has
been convicted since this law was
passed. Does this mean that there are
no more slaves in Mauritania?
It’s difficult to quantify because the
subject is taboo. Nevertheless, we know
that slavery still goes on, because we
regularly pick up victims. Along with
other associations, AFCF has denounced
[Solidarity with Widows Committee] or
SOS Esclaves (SOS Slaves). In 1999, I was
present at the trial of a woman who had
secretly married the head of a company
and was fighting for their two children
to have a share of their deceased
father’s inheritance. The court refused to
recognise his paternity. Hearing this
verdict literally struck her down and she
died on the way to hospital. With no
husband, and so no money, no
education, and therefore no chance of
finding work, she knew that she and her
children would find themselves in the
street. She died because she was unable
to claim her rights. It was then that I
realised it was time to fight for these
abandoned women, so I set up the
Association. Today, the AFCF has over
10,000 members and employs 62
people. Our staff and running costs are
all paid out of members’ subscriptions,
while our projects are funded by donor
agencies.
Mauritanian society is multicultural,
with two main ethnic strands – Arab
Berbers and black Africans. Do women
have the same status in both
communities?
Women traditionally have the same
function in both communities – they are
“made for marriage and to satisfy the
desire of men”, but that translates
differently in daily life. The constraints
aren’t the same. For black Africans, a
good wife pays her way essentially with
household duties, educating the
children and satisfying her husband. If
she does earn money, she generally has
to hand it over to the “master of the
household”. Most Arab-Berber women
escape household chores. This is not
just because their families are generally
better off, but also because a woman
has to be “preserved” to make the best
possible marriage. Pampering her and
feeding her up are an investment.
Family honour depends on girls
marrying young – “she was married
young” being an adage frequently used
by griots as a form of praise. The
nomadic tradition allows more freedom
to Arab-Berber women than their black
African sisters, in terms of what they can
and cannot do. And Arab-Berber
Mauritanian women have a traditional
concept of divorce that is quite unusual.
Not only is it acceptable, but it can even
give a woman added value! A woman
who has been divorced several times is

and ancestral customs have been combined to justify
discrimination against women in Mauritania, says

considered very sought-after. I, myself,
have three children from different
fathers and have been married 5, 6 or 7
times… but now it’s finished! (laughs).
But, for black Africans, divorce is, on the
contrary, frowned upon, and they are
more likely to practice polygamy than
Arab-Berbers, although the current
obscurantist trend means a resurgence
of this tradition for them too. These are
all, of course, generalisations, for which
there are many exceptions.
Force-feeding, child marriage,
excision, slavery, domestic service…
the list of human rights breaches is a
long one. What is your priority?
The most urgent task is to establish a
legal basis for equality between men
and women. For centuries jurisprudence
has mixed up religious imperatives and
tradition to create a cocktail of
discrimination. In Mauritania, a woman
has a legal guardian for her entire life. It
might be her father, her husband or
even her son. She has no rights of her
own. Let us take marriage as an
example. According to the civil code,
the legal age for marriage is 18 years,
but with the guardian’s consent, it may
be celebrated earlier. This, in a way,
legalises childhood marriages and
deprives women of the power to decide.
That was how, one day, when I came
home from school, I discovered I had

cases of slavery to the authorities on
several occasions, but so far, no action
has been taken and no one has been
convicted. The “masters” are people with
high positions and are protected. 
The question of slavery is intimately
linked to women, since, according to
tradition, it is hereditary and passed
down through the mother. That means
it is more advantageous for a “master” to
have female slaves, because he can then
appropriate their offspring. Even so, this
traditional form of slavery, where
individuals are the property of a master
from one generation to the next, is on
the decline. Unfortunately it is being
replaced by a more ‘modern’ form of
slavery – domestic service. Poor families
place their daughters with rich families,
where they often receive only board
and lodging. These girls, who are usually
very young, receive no education and it
is not uncommon for them to be
beaten. There are many of them in
Nouakchott. They mostly come from
rural areas of the country, but also from
neighbouring states like Senegal, Mali
or Gambia. In 2009, with the
international human rights
organization, Terre des Hommes, we
launched a programme that enabled us
to help 2200 minors. 
Do you see Mauritania as a hub for
trafficking children?
This form of traffic has existed for a long
time, but has grown over the past few
years. The traffickers seek out children in
poor families in rural areas, promising
their parents that they will find their
girls work, or a religious pilgrimage, a
favourable marriage, a sum of money,
etc. The girls transit through
Nouakchott, before being taken to the
Gulf, where they are sold and married. If
they are black, their skin is lightened.
Once they reach the age of 18 or 20,
their husbands throw them out into the
street, because they are no longer
young enough for their taste; most then
fall into prostitution. If they are still
minors, they may be deported. Three
years ago I met 14 girls at the airport, all
about 15 years old, who had lived
through this ordeal and did not know
where to go. The prostitution ring also
extends out to Europe. AFCF is currently
looking for funding for a survey to
determine the extent of this
phenomenon.
Are there any areas where you can see
progress ?
Excision! Even though it is disappearing
very slowly, this practice is beginning to
be abandoned collectively, mostly as a
result of a number of agreements and
action by donor organizations, which
have been providing substantial
funding, as well as the commitment of
some highly placed religious figures. 
A fatwa [religious law] was signed
against excision in 2010. The police and
the judiciary have also been made more
aware of the issues, but once again,
there have been virtually no
convictions. 
Force-feeding is also on the decline,
mostly because of a gradual change in
concepts of beauty. But over 20% of
Mauritanian girls jeopardize their health
in an effort to put on weight, even if the
traditional methods have nowadays
been replaced by food supplements,
often with dangerous side effects. 
And then there is political
representation, where we made clear
gains between 2005 and 2007,
particularly with the establishment of a
20% quota for women in elected
institutions. Today, we do have a female
Minister of foreign affairs, but the
number of senior positions held by
women (such as Secretary of state,
police chief, governor) has been falling
since 2008. Symbolically, the Ministry for
the Advancement of Women has once
again been merged within the Ministry
of Social Affairs. Meanwhile, Mauritania,
like some other countries, is under
pressure from right-wing factions that
want to reassign women to a more
primitive role.
What do you recommend women
should do to defend their rights?
Traditionally, women do not follow any
in-depth religious instruction, learning
“just what is needed to pray”. But a
better understanding of religion would
enable them to free themselves from
certain practices. They would know, for
example, that the Koran does not
impose excision and polygamy. I also
think that religions, including Islam,
have to adapt to the modern world – we
should be lobbying religious scholars
for a ‘modern’ exegesis of the scriptures. 
In Mauritania there is a majority of
women – some 52% of the population.
There is, then, the potential to develop a
female elite, able to overcome racial and
ideological schisms. AFCF, in
collaboration with the American
NGOWomen’s Learning Partnership
trains 100 women each year in
leadership skills. Politics is one means
towards our ends, but it may not
necessarily be the best, because many
women, once in power, look after their
own interests first. What is needed is
collective awareness of the issues. It is
starting.
Why did you not go into politics?
Because I prefer to work at grassroots
level, with the victims. It is by getting
women into the streets that we will gain
most power. I know that it is a slow
process, but I do get the feeling we are
at a turning point – the efforts of our

Afraid of
Bangladesh will be celebrating its 40th
anniversary of liberation this year.
How has life changed for women over
these decades?
Lots of things have changed in the last
40 years. To begin with, generally
women are much more conscious of
their rights now. They are much
stronger on demanding their rights and
also very vocal on the political and
social scene.
Of course it is not the same
everywhere in the country, and it could
have been much better, if not for the
interruptions in the democratic process
or the rise of fundamentalism. But in
general, the people have never ever
endorsed the orthodox type of religion.
Sultana Kamal was interviewed by
Anbarasan Ethirajan, Indian
journalist for the BBC in Bangladesh.
That is why women always benefited
from a very liberal atmosphere that
gave them the leverage to debate and
to take part in lots of things.
The prime minister of Bangladesh,
Sheikh Hasina, and the opposition
leader, Khaleda Zia, are women, which
is quite unusual for a Muslim majority
country. 
I like the way you put the question – you
think it is very unusual for a Muslim
majority country. Yes, Bangladesh is a
Muslim majority country but we do not
call ourselves a Muslim country. It is a
country where people of many religions
live, many cultures are alive in
Bangladesh and very well loved and
Women may hold top political posts in Bangladesh, yet discrimination because of gender is
institutionalized, says women’s rights activist Sultana Kamal. In this secular country where
Islam remains the state religion, the rise of fundamentalism and disruptions in the democratic
process are having a direct impact on women’s status.

respected. But we have to be very
honest about the women we see at the
top. They are not there because they are
women or because they have come
through a process which has actually
supported women’s emancipation. They
are there because they bear a legacy.
I would be very honest here - when
we vote for Sheikh Hasina, we in fact
vote for her late father Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman, the first president of the
country. When we vote for Khaleda Zia
we vote for her late husband, General
Ziaur Rahman, the former military
dictator. People still bear the images of
these two very well known leaders.  
But then again the very fact that the
two women are there, running the

country and really taking control of
situations, gives other women a sense of
confidence, a belief that women can do it. 
Which identity is dominant in
Bangladesh? Bengali identity or
Islamic identity? 
Many people wonder whether they are
Muslim or Bengali first. This struggle has
its roots in the Pakistani period. The
main challenge to the people of East
Pakistan from the Pakistani military
rulers was that you had to prove you
were a loyal Pakistani. You had to prove
you were a true Muslim. They actually
merged two identities together. 
But people in Bangladesh generally
believe that we can have multiple
identities. Yes, I am a Muslim or born to
a Muslim family, I am also a Bengali, a
woman, a human rights activist. I am
known by many different names. So
likewise, there will be Hindus and
Christians who will have multiple
identities. The people of Bangladesh
basically believe in pluralism, they
believe in Sufism. Their way of relating
to nature, to God, to whatever mysteries
of life, is dependent on their own
perception of self and nature. 
People’s love of Bangladesh is mixed
with love of the rivers, trees and nature.
It is very much related to the basic
harmony that they want to see
everywhere. It is not a confrontational
culture, but one was created artificially,
constantly supported by forces in the
society that have been able to capture
power and influence through the
economic system, educational system
and cultural inputs.
Have Islamist fundamentalist forces
changed social and cultural life within
Bangladesh?
The fundamentalists have captured the
main sectors of the society, like banking,
insurance, medical and education. And
the worst influence is on education
because they have changed all the
curricula, they have changed all kinds of
information methods in the country.
People must accept the lessons they
teach or surrender to what they think is
the correct path of religion. 
They get into power or stay in power
by using the tool of fear. Whatever
degradation in society we see in
Bangladesh was because they used
weapons. They use religion, which tell us
you cannot question anything, so it is
absolute surrender or nothing. It’s a
question of faith, nothing else.
They are using freedom of
expression, democratic opportunities, to
give religious orders. They keep saying
we want the head of this person or this
individual should be hanged because he
is a traitor, whatever this person has said
is sacrilegious. These tactics scare people.
But you also notice that not many people
actually support all these efforts. They
talk against them and make their
opinions known as soon as they know
there will be not be any repercussion or
retaliation by the fundamentalist forces.
But there are other forces in the society
which support them, give them courage
and will protect them when they are at
risk and that is what happens each time
we have an election.
There have been a number of court
rulings in recent years that no woman
should be forced to wear a burqa or veil.
But if you go outside the capital people
are still wearing traditional Islamic
dress. 
We have to remember women in rural
areas have little means of supporting
themselves economically or socially. All
these people probably belong to the
lower middle class or poor sections of
J Elections in 2008. In Bangladesh the lines of
women waiting to vote are almost always longer
than the men’s.

the society, so their struggle is very basic.
They are using these tactics to at least
get out of the house. As they tell us,
‘Unless I wear a burqa, my family will not
allow me to go out.’ So, only to go to
school, or work or a meeting, they have
to use the burqa. 
How does it happen? In the rural
areas the men are also denied
opportunities and bullied by the social
leaders. Unfortunately, the social leaders
are also connected to religious hierarchy
and push the men to control their
women in that way. And since for many
years this country was ruled by the
generals who had a very strong alliance
with the religious forces, all these things
were promoted, deliberately nurtured
and protected by the state. That is why
it will not be so easy for all women to
refuse from one day to the next to wear
the burqa. 
You see many more burqas now in
Bangladesh than we saw in the Pakistani
time.  This is an outcome of disruptions
in the democratic system where people
were forced to surrender to certain
powers, to be silenced so that they do
not revive the spirit of the liberation war
of 1971. There was a direct conflict
between hard line groups opposed to
our independence and the powers that
actually fought for the liberation of
Bangladesh.

Let’s talk about another major issue,
attacks on women that include throwing
acid on them and sexual harassment of
young girls, which lead to suicide in
many cases. Can these practices be
controlled only by enacting law?
It is a social problem and it has to be dealt
with by social forces. We should create an
atmosphere where women will get
enough confidence that they can fight it.
Also, the state, the society and the families
will have to be involved in protecting
women. We need to explain this to the
families. We have to make it clear that
women have equal rights and dignity in
the country and that has to be
maintained. There cannot be any
compromise there. There has to be a
social movement about it. But then laws
are also helpful because they give you a
kind of a power and confidence that you
can also fight these legally.
Gender bias and prejudice against
women – is it institutionalised in
Bangladesh?
I would say yes, if you look at the personal
laws that exist in the country. According
to these laws, people are governed by
their religious laws and those are very
clearly discriminating against women. But
the state is not doing anything about it.
We have been demanding since 1972 that
there should be a uniform civil code or
family code for everybody. The
government is not able to do anything
about that and we still have a very
confused view of what is positive
I got involved in public life during
the country’s liberation war. I was in
India for some months during the nine-
month war. With my sister, I set up a
hospital for the wounded freedom
fighters. Before then I was engaged in
helping people with information,
shelter, assisting them to cross the
border. 
After our liberation in 1971, I started
working with women affected by the
war, because many came to my mother
with a lot of problems. A number of
women had lost their husbands and had
difficulties with their in-laws. Many
women wanted to remarry and keep
their children. That is how I became
interested in law and became a lawyer. I
felt I could be useful to those people, to
help them realise they do have rights
and they can live with dignity.
You were threatened on many
occasions and there were attempts on
your life. Did you ever feel you were
ready to quit? 
Not really, because I learnt from my
parents that the minute you quit, that is
half the defeat. Why let others feel that
they have won and abandon the causes
you are fighting for? That is the strength
of life: you will only lose your life once.
The fundamentalists did not
approve of my marriage to a Hindu, or
to the people that I associated with, so
they set fire to my house in 1995. We
almost died. Later they threw a bomb.
But I never worried about my own well-
being or my own life. Yes, I have
responsibility towards my husband and
my daughter. They have a claim on my
life. But the way I was brought up and
the way I started understanding the
issues of life taught me that you should
never be afraid. Being afraid is not the
solution. 

discrimination, what is equity, what is an
affirmative action? So there is a lot of
resistance within the society reflected in
the state policies.
There is controversy over how
Bangladesh is treating the Rohingya
ethnic refugees who fled alleged
persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.
What’s your view on this?
One impression I have is that these people
are also being used by supporters of
fundamentalist forces in Bangladesh.
That’s one thing. The other problem as I
heard from our foreign minister is
economic. The minute you recognize
them as refugees and you start dealing
with them according to the treaties, it
represents an economic burden
Bangladesh is not prepared for. 
Population is another problem.
Bangladesh is not being able to deal with
such a huge population.  
On the other hand, as a human
rights activist I would like to say yes, all
these problems are there. But there
should be a decent way of dealing with
them. I strongly feel that these people
also have certain rights and those rights
should be respected.
Tell us about yourself. What prompted
you to become a women’s rights activist? 
I was brought up among people who
were social activists, political activists.
My parents were deeply involved in the
anti-British movement. Then my mother
became the pioneer of the women’s
movement in Bangladesh. She took a
leading role in the language movement
and also in the 1950s and 1960s cultural
movements.

Mónica González Mujica gave an interview to Carolina Jerez and Lucía Iglesias (UNESCO)
Do women do journalism differently?
As a woman journalist, what were your
advantages and the obstacles you had
to overcome throughout your career?
Let’s talk first about the advantages of
being a woman, because there are
some. We have a particular sensitivity,
which I think is very useful for
investigative journalism – a greater
capacity for perceiving who is telling the
truth, who is lying, who is hiding behind
a shield, a mask or a disguise. I also feel
that when women undertake
something, we are more persistent and
we only ease up when the work is done.
We’re hard-headed! And I say that
without being a feminist.
Of course there are obstacles,
particularly when aggressors, torturers,
attack us sexually in order to destroy us. I
discovered under the dictatorship that
rape is primarily intended to break us. No
one could enjoy raping a woman. The
pleasure is to humiliate a woman and rob
her of her identity. But in my case, on the
contrary, it made me stronger.
What do you consider your greatest
professional success? 
The most important accomplishment
for me was to be able to go from
dictatorship to democracy without
giving up journalism. I never gave it up
during the dictatorship, not in jail, not
under torture, not when my friends
were killed, or when I had to be

separated from my daughters, or when
I shared the pain of so many people in
this country. When democracy came,
I felt that there was so much to build.
What I did right was not to give up
journalism and I found a new way to
continue every time I was unemployed.
I managed to do this thanks to the
assistance of many people - I am not a
Superwoman. I am grateful to have met
people who supported me and
encouraged me to persevere when I was
the most afraid. In this profession, you
are put to the test every day and I want
this to go on until I die. 
What is the situation of investigative
journalism today? 
It is without any doubt the type of
journalism most severely under attack
everywhere. Investigation was the first
victim of the economic crisis of 2008. It
was the most expensive journalists that
were laid off first, those who were
dedicated to investigation. As the
investigation’s journalism often is source
of problems and conflicts, the crisis was
a wonderful excuse to get rid of the
desk best equipped to investigate the
real, pressing issues that were decisive
for the lives of citizens. 
If we do not speak out, we are accomplices, says Mónica González Mújica, laureate of the
2010 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. Jailed and tortured during the
dictatorship in Chile, she never relinquished her right to free speech. Denouncing injustice 
is what counts for her, beyond gender barriers.

However, I must stress that the
quality of investigative journalism in
Latin America is at least as high as that of
investigative journalism in English-
speaking countries. And not only today,
because we also did this type of work
under dictatorships. In Chile, for example,
journalists denounced the Pinochet
regime crimes under his dictatorship,
running incredible risks. Either journalists
have to denounce crimes and atrocities
or they become accomplices. And it is
true that investigative journalism always
involves great personal sacrifices and the
use of the journalist’s own funds,
because, let’s face it, no media
organization will pay journalists for
months so they can carry out an in-depth
investigation into an issue and reveal it to
the world. 
Basically, I think that Latino-American
investigative journalism is facing a major
problem: the drug cartels are eroding our
societies. Their final objective is to deprive
us of pleasure, happiness and life. This is
why it is so important to attack them, and
it is also why it is so important to
guarantee that journalists can investigate
and inform, contrary to the current
practice in most countries’ regions.
What is your view of the media
landscape in Latin America? 
Two problems pose an increasingly
urgent threat to the right of society to be
informed. First:  the formidable
concentration of media ownership.
Groups take control of several media
companies thus consolidating television,
radio and the written press, while they
maintain interests in other sectors of
production, such as agriculture, mining,
services, real estate, etc. A media
company cannot provide objective
reporting on corporations of which its
owner has shares. This is very serious.
Journalists are losing their
independence, their dignity and
essential skills.   
The second threat comes from
authoritarian governments, which,
although they came to power
democratically, make journalists their
enemies and submit them to constant
threats. Here, once more, there is
unfortunately no opposition able to
defend freedom of information properly.
Because freedom of information is not
about supporting the government or the
opposition, it is about providing quality
journalism. Just as it is intolerable that

Mónica González Mujica is one of the
most committed and tenacious journalists
in Chile. Exiled in France after the coup
d’état in 1973, she returned to Chile in 1978,
but was not able to practice her profession
again until 1983.  She has managed the
Centro de Información e Investigación
Periodística (CIPER) since May 2007. This
journalism and investigation centre is an
independent non-profit institution
specialized in investigative reporting.

dedicated to defending freedom of the

thousand and one days of the coup), in 2000.
organized crime cartels go to war on
journalists, it is unacceptable for
democratically elected governments to
engage in authoritarian practices.
All this to say the Latin-American
landscape of media industry is,
objectively speaking, discouraging; it
shows the precariousness of journalism.
This is having a deep effect on society. 
It is democracy as a whole that is
undermined, because a badly informed
citizen easily becomes prey to petty
tyrants. We who lived through
dictatorships and who regained freedom
only at the cost of people’s lives consider
that we cannot let democracy get weak
and be manipulated by authoritarian
powers again.  

Gender Equality has long been of central
importance to UNESCO. Since 
its inception over 60 years ago, UNESCO
has been at the forefront of efforts to
support women’s and girls’ rights,
women’s empowerment, and gender
equality through all its domains. Starting
with the promotion of girls and women’s
right to education, UNESCO’s work to
promote this goal has extended to all
levels and aspects of education, the
natural and social sciences, the
information and communication sector
and the complex and rich field of culture. 
In a landmark decision taken by
UNESCO’s Member States in 2007,
UNESCO made its greatest commitment
to the achievement of these goals by
designating “Gender Equality” as one of
its two global priorities for the 2008-2013
period.  
What is Priority “Gender Equality”?
For UNESCO, gender equality is a
fundamental right, a commonly shared
value and a necessary condition for the
achievement of all internationally agreed
development objectives. Gender equality
is not only central to efforts to fight
extreme poverty but it is also related to
the global quest to limit the spread of HIV
and AIDS, mitigate the effects of climate
change and achieve sustainable
development and peace.
UNESCO’s approach and selected
initiatives
In its Member States and within the
Organization, UNESCO pursues gender
equality through a dual approach: on the
one hand, it is engaged in actions that
specifically seek to redress inequalities by
targeting women and girls or men and
boys alone and, on the other, it ensures
that all of its programmes support gender
equality goals through gender
mainstreaming. 
In the area of Education, UNESCO
strives to redress gender inequalities at all
levels in terms of access, retention,
completion, and quality. This includes the
promotion of women’s increased
participation in science, technology,
innovation and research, as well as in
areas such as the ethics of science, culture
and human rights.
UNESCO’s Communication and
Information programme aims to address
the stereotyping of women and
inequalities in women’s access to and
participation in all communication
information systems. It raises awareness
among professionals regarding the need
to include a gender equality perspective
in media content.

The Organization also works
towards the promotion of women’s
empowerment and gender equality
through the integration of these
considerations into its normative work
in areas such as the ethics of science,
culture and human rights.
Within UNESCO, the Division for
Gender Equality in the office of the
Director-General is the key contact for
ensuring the implementation of
UNESCO’s Global Priority Gender
Equality. The Division aims to raise
awareness of gender equality issues
within the Secretariat - and among its
Member States. 
UNESCO formulated a Priority Gender
Equality Action Plan (GEAP) for 2008-2013
as a road map to translate its commitment
to gender equality into practice, to ensure
that UNESCO programmes and initiatives
contribute fully and actively to the pursuit
of women’s rights, women’s
empowerment and gender equality.
The road to gender equality may yet
be long and there is still a lot of hard work
to be done, but on this 8 March 2011, we
wish to celebrate women and the
creation of the historic new UN Entity for
Gender Equality and the Empowerment
of Women – UN Women. 

for Gender Equality

Director-General of UNESCO, 23 October 2009

development and in peace-building processes is a sure way of building stable and open societies,
and ensuring sustainable development.” 1
