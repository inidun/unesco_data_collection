onth by month
This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the United
Nations. The occasion is not being celebrated in a notably festive atmos-
phere. One thinks of Somalia and Rwanda, and also, constantly, of Bosnia.
But can these failures be blamed on the United Nations as such ? If the UN
did not exist, would the situation be better or worse ?
in this issue, we review in a three-part dossier the questions that are
quite rightly asked about the role and functions of the United Nations. The
f ! rst part presents factual information about the UN system and how it
works, and about important moments in its history. The second contains a
critical analysis of the UN's achievements and failures in its three key areas
of activity : peace-keeping, human rights and development. ln the third,
Mr. Boutros Boutros. Ghali, Secretary. General of the United Nations, and
Mr. Federico Mayor, Director-Genera) of UnEsco, set forth their viens on
future deve ! opments.
Many people have a persistent, nagging feeling of deep disappointment
at the gap between what they would have liked to see and what has actually
come to pass, especially since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the bi-
polar world, and the concomitant assertion of demands for freedom, justice
and solidarity.
This sense of disillusion is actually a promising sign, for it reveals the
capital of hope which public opinion has invested in the United Nations. At
the same time, it reflects misapprehensions about the machinery governing
its workings. The way in which the system works is directly dependent on
agreements and disagreements between its Member States, in other words
between their governments-especially the most influential among them.
What the United Nations system most cruelly lacks, and what explains the
disappointments to which it gives rise, is an international consensus on the
objectives and standards whereby the common interests of humanity can
prevaii over the spécifie interests of states or nations and ethnie or religious
communities.
This consensus is still a distant prospect, but it will have to be reached
sooner or later because it is so vital to the future of humanity and the
planet. Who can doubt that when it is finally achieved its main architect will
have been the United Nations system ?
For a ! i its defects, its unwieldiness and its mistakes, which mirror the
imperfections of the international community itself, the United Nations has
patiently authored a unique experiment in international relations and given
rise to the feeling, amorphous though it may be, that in spite of everything
the much-maligned skyscraper in New York is for ait of us an ultimate bas-
tion against barbarism-a forum where we know that yesterday's enemies
will be able to speak to each other tomorrow.

<![CDATA[
Grounds or hope
by Boutros Boutros-Ghali
The world in which we have to carry
out our work is radically different
from that envisaged by the founding fathers
of the United Nations Charter fifty years
ago. But it is also very different from the
world glimpsed after the fall of the Berlin
Wall by those who predicted the coming of a
new international political order.
The United Nations today has to try to
instill order in an international society that
is simultaneously becoming both more
globalized and more fragmented. The his-
tory that is being made before our eyes-
with its characteristic blend of stop-go and
repetition-is confronting the United
Nations with the emergence of a global
society and a return to various kinds of
nationalism. The United Nations is thus
being called upon both to resolve the con-
flicts flaring up ail over the globe and to keep
pace with the major changes taking place in
the world.
In a supplement to my Agenda for
Peace' :- l have tried to draw conclusions
from United Nations action to halt the
armed conflicts and confrontations that
jeopardize international security. In the past
five years, the United Nations has under-
taken more peace-keeping operations than in
the previous forty. The fact is that the very
nature of the conflicts that beset the world
has profoundly changed. We are now having
to contend with instances of secession, parti-
tion, ethnic confrontation and tribal rivalry.
What is more, UN forces now have man-
dates that go well beyond the traditional
idea of peace-keeping. Operations can at pre-
sent encompass election supervision,
humanitarian aid, the reconstruction of
roads and bridges, mine-clearance, the dis-
arming of militias, the repatriation of dis-
placed persons, the reintegration of combat-
ants into civilian life, the protection of
human rights, the promotion of democracy
and many other activities besides.
We must remember ail this at a time when
there is a tendency to dwell more often on
the Organization's failures than on its suc-
cesses. But if the United Nations is to play
its role fully as a servant of peace, it is more
than ever necessary for the Security Council
and the Member States to define and imple-
ment effective and consistent policies.
Emphasis must also be placed on the role
played by the Organization in the world's
economic and social development, which
accounts for more than 70 per cent of its
activity.
From the Earth Summit in Rio to the
Cairo International Conference on Popula-
tion and Development, from the Copen-
hagen World Summit for Social Develop-
ment to the Beijing Conference on Women,
the UN seeks to rally governments and
public opinion around the major issues of
the coming century.
We are all aware that the basic problems
facing humanity are increasingly transna-
tional in nature.
However, the global society in which we
now live is fraught with many dangers,
including that of destroying traditional
bonds of solidarity or marginalizing coun-
tries or even whole regions of the earth, and
hence of further widening the gap between
rich and poor.
We know only too well that this situa-
tion is not without risks. Wars, exclusion,
and ethnie and religious antagonisms always
prosper in such a climate. Irrational and
fanatical thinking is always prompt to pro-
pose fallacious solutions to people who have
lost their bearings.
We should therefore take advantage of
this celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of
the United Nations to join together in
thinking about a new blueprint for living in
society and to offer solid grounds for hope
to states and nations, to men and women the
world oves. t
* In his Agenda for Peace (United Nations, New
York, 1992) written at the request of the Security
Council, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali proposes a series
of measures for reinforcing the UN's capabilities in
preventive diplomacy, peace-making and peace-keeping
and for increasing its effectiveness within the
framework of the Charter's provisions. (Ed.)

Fi ty years on
We ail know that thé Inequalitles
existing in the world today are a scandai
that must be brought to an end. We know too
that the burden of debt must be alleviated so
that the spiralhng process whereby the poor
continue to get poorer and the rich richer can
be halted. We are aware of the need to promote
lifelong vocational training and éducation, to
foster scientific and technological development
so that countries may become masters of their
own fates, to facilitate urban renewal as weM as
rural development, to ensure that the law and
freedom of expression are respected, that the
independence of the judiciary is maintained
and that democratic principles are embodied in
everyday practice.
So much we ait know. But now is a time
for action, in the first instance at the national
level. It is pointless to adopt declarations,
strategies and charters unless countries set
themselves definite plans with precise objec-
tives and deadlines, so as to undertake-
while there is still time-the changes of
direction that are now unavoidable. There
must be changes in behaviour and attitudes
towards the consumption of energy and raw
materials, of production and employment
and also of welfare. Such changes take time,
they require sustained effort and a long-term
outlook ; but it is unfortunately difficult to
reconcile the demands of national politics
with medium-and long-term preoccupa-
tions. When things too obviously go wrong
and imbalances become too glaring, the
powers that be prefer to recommend adjust-
ments, and then apply corrective measures to
offset the often devastating effects of those
adjustments. And they take it upon them-
selves to transpose-or even impose-
models from elsewhere instead of helping
individual countries and peoples to work
out their own plans for the future.
While it is true, however, that history
marches on, contemporary history-the his-
tory we are living through-is not a piece of
machinery that only needs oiling when it
by Federico Mayor
seizes up or can be improved by repeated tin-
kering. We are dealing with the aspirations of
billions of people throughout the world who
need to be provided with a more tolerable
present, and at the same time enabled to
envisage the future as a project, respectful of
their dignity and their culture, from which
they may draw sustenance and to which they
may contribute, often with a creativity that
others better off than themselves might envy.
This urgent need for interdependent
action also involves a thorough-going
reform of the United Nations system. The
system was designed to deal with the prob-
lems of the postwar world but it is ill pre-
pared to meet thé challenges of the present
and the foreseeable future, which are, fìrst
and foremost, those of world development.
We must in ail honesty admit that the
efforts made by the international commu-
nity over the last fifty years to promote
development are far from having achieved the
desired effects. The promises made by the
richest countries, twenty or so years ago, to
help the development of the poorest coun-
tries have not really been kept, while large-
scale movements of capital and market forces
are Increasingly outside states'control.
The undertakings in which we have
invested have ail too often ended in failure,
and the emphasis now placed on peace-
keeping operations-with results that do not
always justify the large sums of money
poured into them-shows that the logic of
responding to emergencies still prevails. But
international stability and security today
transcend the military sphere ; they rely upon
a whole set of economic, financlal, political,
educational, scientific and technological mea-
sures that need to be worked out in concerted
fashion and applied in good time.
We therefore need to revise our conception
of the role of the United Nations system
without delay. We are spending vast amounts
on deploying armies to"re-establish"peace
and then on restoring, repairing and recon-IJ

structing what has been destroyed by warfare,
but it is war itself that we should destroy, by
rooting out the underlying causes of conflict :
poverty, social injustice, political oppression,
and discrimination and exclusion in ail their
forms. The time has come to put the Charter
in its totality into effect and to move on
from a conception of the rôle of the United
Nations whereby peace-keeping constituted
ils principal task to a more ambitious concep-
tion, having in view the prevention of con-
flicts and the building of peace.
The places where peace has hitherto made
most headway are those where societies have
succeeded in maintaining their cohesion and
progress while preserving respect for human
rights, providing themselves with democ-
ratic structures and making development a
ioint undertaking, i. e. ensuring that its fruits
are fairly shared. Many societies today are,
however, aiso under threat from faceless ene-
mies : unemployment, poverty and exclusion
that are becoming worse and worse from day
to day, despite the emergency measures
applied in some places. Even where tolerance
used to be the order of the day, a shift
towards xenophobia is becoming more evi-
: sent, and chauvinist or racist utterances that
han seemed to be a thing of the past are heard
more and more often, and are taken up and
wmetimes amplified by certain intellectual
alites who are incapable of seeing beyond the
horizon of national frontiers.
Indignation is an insufficient response to
this state of affairs. We need to find a real
riposte to the real threats now posed to
international security in the shape of exclu-
sinon, rural decline and urban decay, large-
scalpe emigrations, deterioration of the envi-
ronment, new pandemic diseases and the
traffic in arms and drugs.
In UNESCO's own specific domain, we
need to rally the forces of the human mind
to this cause. We must concentrate our
efforts on the development of human
resources with a view to getting back, after
décadres when strategies have been character-
ized by a narrowly economic approach, to
that which lies at the very heart of develop-
ment, the human individual. We are learning
to invest in that intangible asset, human cre-
itivity, and in the acquisition, transfer and
pooling of knowledge, which hold the key
to any process of individual and collective
émancipation. Emancipation can never be
ichieved in isolation or by turning in upon
Jneself. It is by receptivity and interaction
that cultures grow strong, and it is by expe-
riencing and seeking out the Other that indi-
vidual personalities are formed.
A symbolic dove of peace at
Lillehammer (Norway)
To counter the culture of war wc must
construct a culture of peace, a culture of con-
viviality, founded upon the principles of
freedom, justice and democracy, of tolerance
and solidarity, and upon respect for ail
human rights ; a culture that rejects violence
and seeks solutions to problems through
dialogue and negotiation ; a culture of pre-
vention that endeavours to get to the very
root of conflicts in order, as far as this is
possible, to stop them erupting.
Development for peace and peace for
development, these are the two thrusts of
our action. Helping the weakest, bringing
society's outcasts back into the fold, facili-
tating the exercise of civil rights and the par-
ticipation of the whole population in devel-
opment, learning to live together and build
together in spite of disagreements and dif-
ferences, these are our objectives, t

MAJOR CONFL/CF
The UN's main goal is to maintain world peace, especially by
contributing to the resolution of major confrontations
THE BERLIN BLOCKADE
hl948, 1948, the city of Berlin was divided into
two zones : West Berlin under British, French
and American occupation, and East Berlin
under Soviet occupation. in a bid to curb infla-
tion, on 18 June the United States, France
and the United Kingdom introduced a mone-
tary reform which was meant to include West
Berlin. On 23 June, Stalin intervened and
barred ais land and river access to the city
from the western sectors.
The Western powers mounted an emer-
gency airlift, which kept the city supplied for
almost one year. ln September, they brought
the issue before the Security Council. The
Secretary-General, Trygve Lie, organized con-
sultations which reached a successful con-
clusion on 4 May 1949 and led to the lifting
oftheb ! ockade.

The origins of the partition of Korea date back
to the end of the Second World War. ion 1948,
in spite of United Nations efforts to estab-
lish a united Korean State, the country was
split in two. The same year, the General
Assembly created the United Nations Com-
mission on Korea, which was replaced in 1950
by the United Nations Commission for the
Reunification and Rehabilitation of Korea.
On 25 June 1950. the Korean War broke
out. On 7 July, the Security Council reated
an international force under unified command.
Contingents from 16 countries joined the mil-
itary forces of South Korea.
THE KOREAN WAR
The Soviet Union, having refrained from
occuPYlng its seat on the Security Council for
SIX months*, consldered that the Council's
decision was Illegal because it had been taken
in ! ts absence. but this had no effect.
On 1 August, the Soviet Union declded
to return to the Council and vetoed ail the
draft resolutions put to it.
On 3 November. Dean Acheson. the Ameri-
can Secretary of State, secured the adoption of
a resolution authonzing the General Assembly
to deal with matters blocked by a veto in the
Security Council and, in case of need, to allow
the use of force by a two-thirds majority vote.
! n thé same month, volunteers from the
People's Republic of China joined in the war
alongside North Korea. The Council requested
the withdrawal of the Chlnese troops, only to
be faced with the Soviet veto. in response,
the Assembly formed a group to examine the
conditions for a cease-fire.
On 18 May 1951, the General Assembly
decided to impose an embargo on China. On
30 June, North Korea accepted an armistice
o ffer. A preliminary agreement was reached in
February 1952. On 27 July 1953, at Pan-
munjom, the United Nations command and
the Chinese-North Korean command signed
an armistice agreement, th us brlnging the
Korean War to an end.
A joins communiqué issued by the two
governments on 4 July 1972 announced that

ARAB-) SRAEL) WARS
The question of Palestine is at the origin of the Arab-Israeli conflict in the
Middle East. ! n 1947, when the General Assembly had to decide on its
future, this territory administered by the Uni edKingdom had a popula-
tion of about two million inhabitants (composed of two-thirds Arabs and
one-third Jews).
On 29 November, the General Assembly adopted a partition plan pro-
viding for the creation of an Arab state and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem
coming under an international regime administered by the United Nations. ln
December, this plan was rejected by the Arab Summit meeting held in Cairo.
On 14 May 1948, the United Kingdom relinquished its mandate over
Palestine. The state of Israel was proclaimed. On the following day, the
Palestinians, together with the armies of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and
Jordan, opened hostilities against the new state. in 1949, these four
countries and Israel signed armistice agreements. The United Nations
Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) assisted the parties in com-
plying with the provisions of these agreements.
However, border incidents continued.
Following the nationalization of the Suez Canal announced by
Egypt on 26 July 1956, Israeli forces invaded Sinai, while British and
French troops landed at Suez at the end of October.
On 4 November, the General Assembly, meeting in special session,
called for a cease-fire and created the first peace-keeping force, the
United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF), which supervised the pro-
gressive withdrawal of the Israeli, British and French troops, patrolled
the demarcation line between Egypt and Israel and brought relative
quiet to the area.
UNEF was withdrawn at Egypt's request on 16 May 1967. On 5
June, war broke out again between Israel on the one hand, and Egypt,
Jordan and Syria on the other. The Security Council called four times for
a cease-fire, which was eventually concluded on 11 June. At that date,

Israel occupied Sinai, the Gaza strip, the West Bank of the Jordan,
including East Jerusalem, and part of the Syrian Golan Heights. The Secu-
rit y Council sent observers to monitor the cease-f ! re.
On 22 November 1967, the Council unanimously adopted resolu-
tion 242, which laid down the general principles lor a peacefu ! and
lasting settlement : the wìthdrawal 01 Israeli armed forces from terrils-
ries occupied in the most recent conflict ; the termination of ail claims or
states of belligerency ; respect for and recognition of the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence 01 every state in the area ;
the guarantee of free navigation through international waterways in the
area ; and the establishment of demilitarized zones.
Between 1967 and 1973, the Secretary-General's representative,
Gunnar Jarring, had talks with the countries concerned (with the xcep-
tion of Syria, which did not accept resolution 242), but without reachlng
a successful outcome. On 6 October 1973, hostilities resumed.
On 24 October, the Security Council created the second Un ! ted
Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I The deployment of 7, 000 men from
twelve countries brought the October war to an end.
The ensuing withdrawal 01 lorces took place under United Nations
supervision.
CR) S) S) N THE CONGO
in 1960, shortly after the Congo gained inde-
pendence, inter-ethnic disorders broke out
and Belgium, the former colonial power, sent
troops to the country.
On 11 July 1960, Moise Tshombe, a polit-
icalleader in Katanga province, announced the
secession of Katanga. On 12 July, Congolese
leaders Joseph Kasuvubu and Patrice
Lumumba requested UN military assistance.
! n iess than 48 hours, contingents provided
by more than 30 countries started to arrive in
the country, along with UN civilian experts,
whose task it was to help maintain public ser-
vices. On 25 July, Belgian troops withdrew
from the entire territory except for Katanga.
On 17 January 1961, Patrice Lumumba
was assassinated. One month later, the
Security Council authorized the use of force
to prevent civil war in Congo. UN forces took
controi of the territory between Kabalo and
Albertville. The secessionist forces, led by for-
eign mercenaries, clashed with the United
Nations forces. On 17 September, the Secre-
tary-General of the United Nations, Dag Ham-
marskjôtd, was killed in a plane crash on his
way to Ndola to meet Tshombe.
Initially responsible for ensuring the with-
drawal of Belgian troops from the Congo, the
UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld in
Katanga, Congo (now Zaire) in August 1960.
United Nations Operation in the Congo
(ONUC) became an operation to maintain the
country's territorial integrity and political inde-
pendence, It prevented civil war and ensured
the evacuation of ait foreign military and para-
military forces, and ofaii mercenaries.
By the time it ended in June 1964, this
operation-one of the largest in the history
of the United Nations-was responsible for
implementing a vast long-term programme of
technical assistance, employing some 2, 000
experts at its height in 1963-64.
THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS
With the comingto power of Fidel Castro, rela-
tions between Cuba and the United States
deteriorated. ln April 1969, Cuban exiles
armed by the United States landed at the Bay
of Pigs. Their plan to trlgger off a popular
uprising came to nothing. ! n thé face of con-
tinuing American hostility, Cuba appealed to
the Soviet Union for assistance.
On 18 October 1962, the Americans
detected work being carried out on the installa-
tion of Soviet rockets capable of reachingAmer-
ican territory. Four days later, U. S. President
John F. Kennedy imposed a complete blockade
of the island and sent out naval patrols. Soviet
and American warships encircled Cuba. A con-
flict between the two great powers was only one
step away.
TheSecretary-GeneraoftheUnited
Nations, Sithu U Thant, then intervened per-
sonally, sending messages to President
Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita S,
Krushchev, and holding separate meetings
with representatives of the two parties. The
Soviets agreed to withdraw the missiles and
the United States confirmed its undertaking
to withdraw its missiles from Turkey.

THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR
After the conflict of the 1970s, when the
United Nations contributed effectively to the
conclusion of an agreement between Iran and
Iraq, hostilities flared up again in September
1980. On 28 September, the Security Council
gave urgent attention to the matter and
requested the two parties to settle their dis-
pute through mediation or conciliation.
Between 1980 and 1986, the Security
Council adopted seven resolutions and dis-
patched several missions to Baghdad and
Teheran. UN experts confirmed that chemical
weapons were being used, and this was con-
demned by the Security Council and the secre-
tary-General.
On 20 July 1987, the Security Council
Offi cers of the United Nations Iran-
Iraq Military Observer Group
(UNIIMOG) at their Sector
Headquarters at Sulymaniyah (Iraq).
unanimously adopted resolution 598 which, a
year later, was to become the framework for
reaching a cease-fire agreement.
The Secretary-General engaged in intense
diplomatic activity and established direct con-
tacts between the two governments. Discus-
sions under the auspices of the United
Nations continued after the signature of the
armistice. The United Nations Iran-Iraq Military
Observer Group (UNIIMOG) supervised and
verified the withdrawal of troops to the inter-
nationally recognized boundaries. Its man-
date was terminated in 1991.
CAMBODIA
in 1989, the five permanent members of the
Security Council embarked on a series of dis-
cussions and in November 1990 prepared a
document setting out the mandate of a
future United Nations Transitional Authority
in Cambodia.
in June 1991, the Cambodian parties
decided to apply an unlimited cease-fire and to
stop receiving military assistance. in October,
the United Nations set up the United Nations
Advance Mission in Cambodia (UNAMIC),
which helped the parties concerned to main-
tain the cease-fire and until March 1992
engaged in alerting the civilian population to
the danger of land mines and in training people
to detect and clear them.
On 23 October 1991, the Cambodian
parties signed the Cambodia Agreements in
Paris (France) and assigned to the United
Nations ait powers necessary to ensure their
application.
h March 1992, the United Nations
launched a programme of repatriation and
resettlement for some 375, 000 refugees and
displaced persons and established the
United Nations Transitional Authority in Cam-
bodia (UNTAC). UNTAC supervised the cease-
fire and the withdrawal of foreign forces, dis-
armed a ! ! armed forces of the Cambodian
parties, supervised the activities of the
administrative structures, and organized free
elections.
The elections took place from 23 to 28
May 1993, after which the new Cambodian
government was formed.
RWANDA
Fighting between the Armed Forces of the Government of Rwanda and
the Rwandese Patriotic Front first broke out in October 1990 across the
border between Rwanda and Uganda. in spite of a number of cease-fire
agreements, hostilities resumed in February 1993. The United Nations
Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) supervised the border
area and became an important factor of stability inthe region.
On 4 August 1993, a comprehensive peace agreement was signed
in Arusha, providing for the installation f a democratic government,
the repatriation frefugees, the intégration of the armed forces of the
two parties and the deployment of a neutral international force to
assist in its application.
in October 1993, the military observers of UNOMUR were placed
under the command of the new United Nations Assistance Mission for
Rwanda (UNAMIR).
The deaths of the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi in a plane
crash on 6 April 1994 triggered off a resumption of the civil war in
Rwanda. The situation changed radically. UN troops were attacked and
killed, and the Belgian battalion pu lied out.The"blue helmets"never-
theless continued their humanitarian activities incollaboration with the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
On 22 June 1994, the Security Council decided to authorize the
mounting of a multinational operation. This was Operation Turquoise-
a French initiative with the assistance of African troops-which
ensured protection of safe areas in July and August, until the UN con-
tingent returned in strength.

THE GULF WAR
On 2 August 1990, the day of Iraq's inva-
sion of Kuwait, the Security Council
imposed mandatory sanctions and under-
took diplomatic moves in a bid to avoid war.
It set 15 January 1991 as the deadline by
which Iraq was required to comply with its
resolutions.
Since Iraq did not comply, on 16 Jan-
uary the multinational forces launched air
attacks, and these were fo ! ! owed, on 24 Feb-
ruary, by a ground offensive. This operation,
known as Operation Desert Storm, con-
sisted of troops from 28 countries acting
on the authorization of the S curity Council
under U. S. command.
On 27 February, the Iraqi forces left
Kuwait.

vation Mission (UNIKOM), established in
April 1991, provides for international moni-
toring of the cease-fire line and of the

SOMALIA
The downfall of President Siad Barre in Jan-
uary 1991 triggered off an increasingly bloody
struggle for power. Political chaos was com-
pounded by famine, disease and banditry.
Hundreds of thousands of Somalis died and
more than one million fled into exile.
The United Nations was fully engaged in
humanitarian activities, with which FAO,
UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and WHO were
associated. The United Nations Operation ln
Somalia (UNOSOM 1 : April 1992-April 1993)
constantly had to contend with attacks and
looting by armed bands.
On 9 December 1992, the first elements
of the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), led by the
United States, were deployed in Mogadishu,
with the mission of supporting the humani-
tarian assistance missions. Its activities were
taken over by UNOSOM If in May 1993.
UNOSOM If achleved remarkable results
in providing humanitarian assistance. How-
ever, in spite of the conciliation agreements
signed between the Somali polltical move-
ments (in January 1993, March 1993 and
May 1994), it did not succeed in carrying
through the agreed disarmament process,
which was the basic prerequisite for the Oper-
ation's success.
The 29 countries which provided a total of
28, 000 troops and some 2, 800 civilians decided
each in turn to withdraw their contingents.
in March 1995, the last UN troops left
Somalia, but the humanitarian agencies of the
United Nations and non-governmental organi-
zations stayed on.

CONFLICT BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN
! n 1947, under the partition plan provided for
under the Indian Independence Act, the State of
Jammu and Kashmir was free to accede to India
or Pakistan, with both of which it has a common
border. The Maharaja of the State requested its
accession to India. This choice was at the raot
of an armed conflict between India nd Pakistan,
which has been under United Nations surveil-
lance for almost the past fifty years.
On 31 December 1947, the matter was
referred to the Security Council which on 20 Jan-
uary 1948 established a United Nations Com-
mission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP), with a
view to putting an end to the conflict. The cease-
fire came into effect on 1 January 1949. The first
UN military observers to arrive in the area on 24
January formed the nucleus of the United
Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pak-
istan (UNMOGIP). ! n Juiy, thé two countries
signed the Karachi (Pakistan) Agreement estab-
lishing a cease-fire line to be supervised by the
observers.
in August 1965, hostilities again broke out
and spread to the international border between
India and West Pakistan. The Secretary-General
established an administrative adjunct of
UNMOGIP, the United Nations India-Pakistan
Observation Mission (UNIPOM), which was
required to supervise the cease-fire beyond the
borders of Kashmir. The Security Council cailed
for a cease-fire with effect from 22 September
1964. The opposing troops were withdrawn in
February 1966. UNIPOM's task was accom-
plished.
On 3 December 1971, hostilities brake
out yet again on the cease-fire line in Kashmir.
The next day, the General Assembly called for
a cease-fire, which was accepted on 17
December. h July 1972, India and Pakistan
signed the Simla Agreement defining a Line of
Controi in Kashmir.
UNMOGIP continues to exist, but with a
reduced contingent. It task consists in
observing compliance with the cease-fire of
17 December 1971 and in reporting thereon
to the Secretary-Generai.
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA
The disintegration fYugoslavia sparked off a
civil war which, between June 1991 and June
1992, extended from Croatia to Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
in March 1992, the United Nations Pro-
tection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed with
the mission of supervising the demilitariza-
tion of the areas protected by the United
Nations and, later, the Dubrovnik region.
h view of the deterioration of the situation
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the mandate and
strength of UNPROFOR have been enlarged sev-
eral times. Its task is to ensure the operation of
Sarajevo airport, the delivery of humanitarian
assistance, and the control of military flights n
the airspace over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
cease-fire agreements in Bosnia and Herze-
govina have not been respected.
in December 1992, UNPROFOR was
deployed on a preventive mission in Macedonia.
From 1994 onwards, NATO engaged in
military strikes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 31 March 1995, UNPROFOR was split
into three separate but interdependent peace-
keeping forces : UNPREDEP (former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia), UNPROFOR (Bosnia
and Herzegovina) and UNCRO (Croatia).

THE BALANCE SHEET
- 1-
The rand to peace
by Maurice Bertrand
To improve its response 0 crises,
the United Nations will probably have to
rethink its structure
There are two conflicting theories
about the future of the United
Nations. According to the more widelv
accepted one, the structure of international
organizations can only change after the end
of a world war, as history would scem to
demonstrate-the League of Nations was set
up in 1919 and the United Nations in 1945.
This argument rests on the observation that
it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, ta
obtain a consensus within the"international
community"for alterations to the legal
framework governing relations between
states. Only a universel surge of emotion
such as that caused by the ending of a war, or
rather the victory of a coalition on a world-
wide scale, could therefore create the condi-
tions for such a consensus.
In this view, unless there were to be a
third world war the United Nations, what-
ever the difficulties it might encounter,
would be fated to survive as it is for many
decades, and the appropriate response to i ts
fiftieth anniversary would therefore be to
wish it many happy returns. While con-
ceding that we Iive m a changing world and
that ideas, including ideas about peace,
evolve, proponents of this argument bclieve
that the existing institutions will manage ta
adapt to such changes without needing in-
depth reform.
The other theory, proceeding from a more
complex analysis of institutional change, calls
for reforms, or an aggiornamento, of the
system as a whole to be carried out without
delay. However, it concurs with the previous
theory in believing that it was the thinking
on the subject of peace summed up by U. S.
President Woodrow Wilson'that shaped the
League of Nations in 1919, and it further
observes that the same thinking-corrected
and supplemented by"functionalist"ideas
 on the pooling of efforts in science and tech-
... notogy-lay behind the Roosevelt adminis-
tration's setting up of the Bretton Woods
institutions (the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank) in 1944 and the
United Nations in 1945.
Statesmanship in the post-war world
This theory therefore readily accepts 1919
and 1945 as being crucial dates since they cor-
responded to exceptional situations, but
points out that other institutional changes
have corne about at other times and in other
circumstances. One of these changes is of
especial importance, the ongoing process of
European construction since the 1950s, from
the establishment of the European Coal and
Steel Community to the Treaty of Rome
and then the Treaty of Maastricht.
The fact is that European construction
has had a far more effective influence on the
establishment of world peace than the
League of Nations or the United Nations,
insofar as it has succeeded in rendering
almost unimaginable an outbreak of war
among France, the United Kingdom, Ger-
many, Austria and Italv, countries that until
1945, and for a thousand years before then,
had been involved in innumerable conflicts,
including the two world wars.
On the global scale, other important
institutions have been founded since 1945 : in
1956, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) ; in 1975, the G7 group, a
summit gathering of the Heads of State or
Government of the seven leading Western
industrial countries which provided previ-
ousiy tacking opportunitics for exchanges of
views between the gréât powers and set up
the equivalent of a world"board of direc-
tors" ; and in 1994, the World Trade Organi-
zation (WTO).
These examples suffice to show that fun-
damental institutional changes corne about
when statesmen, whose position allows

There is now a ven'bload measure of
Jcknow1cdgment of the need for wide-
rangi Ilg, rapid"change"i n the \Vorld. Political
discourse abounds) increasingly in clichés
about the constraints of mterdependence, a
sing1e \Volld market, acid rain"knowing no

"gioba) vrillage". Thc free-market tdcology,
with its accompanying monetarist view of the
econom y, predomi nates and, though mcreas-
ingly challenged, monopolizes thinking in
thèse matters. Thc end of thc Cold War has
not had thc samc kind of répercussions as the
end of the tao wortd wars but has led to a
graduai calling into question of thé type of

This reassessment has in large part been
brought about by the gênera) sense of frus-
tration arising from the failure of attempts
to setttc the growing numbcr of intra-state
conflicts that arc breaking out in various
parts of thc world (Yugos) avia, thc Cau-

from the increa. sing) v vast floods of rcfugees

opinion in general but also to the heads of
the major business enterprises and those in
charge of the economy and public finances.
Added to ais this, the profound changes
in the mode of production brought about
by rapid progress in electronics and commu-
nications are aggravating unemployment,
bringing down wages and contributing to
marginalization in the rich as weIl as in the
poor countries.
Yet neither governments nor the interna-
tional institutions have any solutions to offer
to these new threats. The credibility of the
entire political class is thus being undermined
in very many countries. It is as though nation-
states had become incapable of solving their
own problems because they have become
world-wide problems, while at the same time
the international institutions have failed to
acquire the powers needed in order for them
to be able to make up for these shortcomings.
Public anxiety about this situation may
give rise to one of two attitudes. On the one
hand, racist, nationalist, populist and fascist
trends may grow stronger in the rich coun-
tries while at the same time the poor coun-
tries turn inwards on themselves in the search
for ethnic identity or under the influence of
nationalism or religious fundamentalism. On
the other hand, there may be a renewal of the
democratic ideology that opposes fascism and
defends human rights, leading on to calls for
institutional reform on a global scale.
The first of these trends is already mani-
festing itself in the rise of populist and
extreme right-wing parties in Europe, the
spread of nationalist and militarist ideas in the
United States and the exacerbation of various
forms of fundamentalism in many countries
of the South. However, the unease caused by
this trend is provoking résistance In thé form
of movements by citizen groups and by a sec-
tion of the general public in support of
stronger defence of human rights, democracy
and peace.
The kind of society that should be set up
in order to ensure the success of the humanist
and universalist ideology remains, however,
ill-defined, especially as regards peace and the
share-out of political responsibilities at the
global, regional and national levels.
Underrated proposais
As a result of this state of uncertainty, much
thought has been given and many suggestions
have been made in the last ten years or so as ta
the reform or complete reorganization of
international institutions. This is something
new ; until 1985 ail thinking on this subject
was paralysed by forty years of the Cold War.
Not only are Germany and Japan, at the most
officiai ! evel, ciaiming their places as perma-
nent members of the UN Security Council
but other institutional proposais are begin-
ning to win approval from the majority of
experts and at least some politicat ieaders m
various countries.
These proposais include : the establish-
ment of an Economic Security Council, a
body of limited membership comprising
representatives of the major powers-in eco-
nomic or demographic terms-and the var-
ious regions of the world (equivalent to
envisaging an enlargement of the G7) ; the
introduction of international taxation ta
replenish the budgets of the international
organizations ; making good the"democratic
deficit"on a global scale by means of
improved representation of civil society or
even a World Parliament ; defining and imple-
menting a"conflict-prevention strategy"
instead of relying solely on the inefficient
methods of"preventive diplomacy"or
trusting to those of"collective security",
illusory as they have proved to be ; thor-ID

ough-going reform of the International
Monetary Fund or its possible replacement
by a body akin to a"World Central Bank"
providing better guarantees of stabiiitv in
exchange rates.
The tendency emerging from the efforts
undertaken, this year alone, in over a hun-
dred commissions, symposia, seminars and
research programmes, is towards recognition
of thé fundamental requirements that
modern international institutions should
meet : an effective system of joint consulta-
tion by the world's politicat ieaders ; démon-
ratic representation of citizens ; a security
System making it passible to prevent the
outbreak of civil wars ; and better safeguards
of economic stability.
These proposais continue, however, to
run up against national potiticat leaders'tack
of interest in problems of this kind and the
public's lack of information about them.
There is thus a long way to go before they
can be seen as viable political responses to the
most urgent probicms.
The future of the United Nations is in fact
tied up with the evolution of the world polit-
ical situation itself and with the nature of the
crises arising therein in the years ahead. Should
serious crises of security occur-such as the
mass migrations caused by civil wars in coun-
tries near to the industrialized world, which
are in danger of provoking a sharp increase in
racist and ultranationalist reactions in the rich
countries-they could lead to the rejection of
thé United Nations or even to its démise, as
the world reverts to national rivalries and the
compétitive struggle for hegemony.
On the other hand, crises which, though
less grave, neverthetess sound serious warn-
ings, in the field of economic security for
instance, could induce those statesmen who
take the long view and who are concerned to
avoid a disastrous outcome to recommend
and put into effect reforms broad enough to
allow for the graduai reorganization and
reinforcement of the international institu-
tional structure.
The future of the United Nations will
thus depend, in thé final analysais, on the
ability of siaiesmen to suggest, and to put
into effect, visionary solutions-before) it is

THE BALANCE SHEET
- 2-
The development debate
by Christian Comeliau
Can development be the same for ail ?
; S : : ; '' Has thé United Nations contributed
to development in its fifty years of
existence and if so, to what kind of develop-
ment ? What roule can we expect to see it play
in this field in the coming years ?
In a short article it is scarcely possible to
present a complete assessment'. To do so
would, for a start, be a technically challenging
undertaking : how could precise demarcation

lines be drawn between action in support of
development and other related fields such as
international security, human rights, humani-
tarian activities or many specific areas such as
childhood, food, labour and health ? It is dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to give an overall pic-
ture of activities that are many-sided and com-
plex and are carried out by a large number of
specialized agencies and programmes.
Another difficulty in the way of this
assessment is that it is the subject of heated
controversy : given that development results
from a political process rather than from mere
technocratic know-how, it entails choices
between different objectives and arbitration
between different interest groups, and hence a
constant interplay of power relationships,
ideological confrontations and negotiating
stratégie.
An uneven track record
1 should like to emphasize four points.
Firstly, the challenge of meeting the
overall demands of development on a world-
wide scale is an enormous one, made even
greater by recent political and economic
upheavals. No organization is capable of
meeting that challenge single-handed in a sat-
isfactory way. The question thus arises :
should the role of an international organiza-
tion be limited to a few day-to-day manage-
ment tasks, or can it be expected to corne up
with the new ideas and carry out the changes
that such a challenge calls for ? The initial
temptation, as regards the second half of the
question, would be to answer no, but that
would be to overlook the conceptual and
methodological value of ideas recently put
forward by the United Nations such as"sus-
tainable"development,"human"develop-
ment and"social"developmem-even if the
uses to which these concepts have so far been
put fall short of the potential they represent.
Secondly, in the matter of development,
the United Nations has served as an arena for
dialogue and confrontation between North
and South. Confrontation has, however, had
the upper hand over dialogue, and has provedID

fruitless : either the end result has been incom-
patible sets of demands, as was the case of the
debates surrounding the"New International
Economic Order"in the 1970s, or poorly
presented and inappropriate demands have
been repeatedly put forward, as was the case
with increased public aid to development,
which was supposed to have reached 0. 7 per
cent of donor countries'GNP but still stands
at half that rate !
As to the confrontation between the cap-
italist and socialist theories of development,
no serious debate on the subject ever took
place, with the very regrettable result that
simplistic conceptions of the role of market
forces now hold sway.
Thirdly, the weak point of the United
Nations is that it has never had a proper body
of principales as regards development. It has
always fallen into line with the viewpoints of
the financial institutions, which are them-
selves dominated by neoclassical orthodoxy
and the vested interests of the North, albeit
with a few of the demands of the South,
irreconcilable as they are with that ortho-
doxy, thrown in for good measure. The
United Nations Development Programme

the principles and outlook of the World
Bank, which accounts for the incoherent
nature of the"development decades"and
suchlike solemnly proclaimed events.
Fourthly, this being the case, it cornes as
no surprise to see the very uneven quality of
the development activities of the United
Nations, not only regarding population, the
environment or children but also in the
fields of structural adjustment, industrializa-
tion, food and international trade. This
uneven track record, parti inevitable
though it may be, is particularly regrettable
since the United Nations has shown on
many occasions that it is capable of doing
excellent work in these fields, work that is
now more than ever needed.
Making the UN a more global
organization
How could performance be improved in the
future ? The record shows serious shortcom-
ings that can only be put right by means of a
comprehensive overhaul of the entire United
Nations system. The primary need is to take
steps to make it a truly global organization.
This means, in the first place, allowing the
major players in the development process ta
be more fairly represented at the world level.
The United Nations cannot go on letting a
minority of states, albeit the richest ones,
hold the financlal and monetary levers of
development in their hands, as they do today.
The institutional solution is not, however, an
easy one : the richest countries cannot be
required to provide most of the funding for
organizations over whose decisions they have
no control.
Next, the new organization must be able
to act in an integrated and coherent manner
upon all the dimensions of development and
not be limited to only some of them, as was
seen to be the case during the preparations
for the Copenhagen Summit for social
development. The view was expressed on
that occasion that the United Nations
should specialize in"social"development
and leave the economic aspects of develop-
ment to other bodies. Such a break-up
would be both absurd and disastrous, espe-
cially as one of the most urgent tasks for
thinking and planning in relation to devel-
opment is that of integrating its economic,
social and political dimensions. It is a task
the United Nations cannot shirk.
Lastly, such an organization should
understand the expression"development"as
encompassing a much wider range of social
needs than just the need, as set forth in the
model that prevails today, for access to greater
and greater consumption of goods. Not only
must the structures of production and con-
sumption that characterize growth be recon-
sidered ; we must also accept pluralism in the
définition of development, of the elements of
which it is composed, of the way in which it
is shared out, and of the models of social
organization upon which it depends-in
political terms, a much harder task.
These reforming ideas have far-reaching
implications. They confer upon the United
Nations a power of arbitration in the alloca-
tion of collective resources to the satisfaction
of needs that are considered, world-wide, as
having priority, such as the reduction of the
least acceptable forms of physical depriva-
tion or social oppression, the banning of
trade in certain weapons or the protection of
the basic conditions for the survival of the
ecosystem, whether or not these needs meet
the criteria of the dominant economic
approach.
Thus enlarged, the conception of the role
of the United Nations runs the obvious risk
of suffering from the same lack of realism as
has marked the Organization in the past-one
need only think back to the grandiloquentm

declarations about the"right of ail peoples to

to health by the year 2000". The risk is a
double one : on the one hand, the danger is
that the political and social basis for defining
these priorities wu be lacking ; and on the
other, an even worse danger, that a cosmetic
consensus wiH be arrived at around a few gen-
eral objectives to which nobody is committed.
This lack of realism could, however, be
avoided by sticking to precise, spécifie com-
mitments, entailing well-defined strategies
and resources. l shall cite two examples.
The first relates to international trade. In
this field, the prevailing model imposes a
spécifie orientation on all countries through
the action of the Bretton Woods institu-
tions and the GATT'accords, in particular
the fullest possible integration of national
economies into international trade in accor-
dance with the often obscure rule of"com-
parative advantages". The social costs of this
narrow, mercantile conception of develop-
ment have, alas, been proven beyond ail
doubt, yet the United Nations has never
made any serious attempt to reverse it.
The second relates to the new ways of
funding deveiopment and in particular to
the role that a world-wide taxation system
might play. This idea, recently taken up by
the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme, has the advantage of being rela-
tively paintess while potentially bringing in
considerable resources. A much clearer com-
mitment by the United Nations, or by a
renovated world organization, to such a
scheme would doubtiess be much more
effective than any number of generous-
sounding but empty speeches,
The task of thinking these questions out
and, in particular, of making spécifie pro-
posais is going ahead, but remains inadequate
and needs to be tackled more thoroughly. The
stakes are high. It is not a matter of promising
a"radiant future"but, by trying to eradicate
certain unacceptable factors, of ensuring the
survival of the present worid. t

applicable to every state, whatever its formai
attitude to their legal status. The view that
human rights violations are essentially
domestic matters, while still put forward in
an almost rital manner from time to time,
receives very little credence from the interna-
tional community.
The Universal Déclaration has been sup-
plemented by a vast array of international
standards, the most important of which are
the six"core"human rights treaties-the
two Covenants and Conventions dealing
with racial discrimination, discrimination
against women, torture, and children's
rights. In addition to the six expert treaty
bodies created by the United Nations to
supervise the compliance of states parties
with their obligations under those treaties,
regional human rights conventions, and
implementing machinery, have been set up in
Europe, the Americas and Africa, and the
United Nations has created a complex array
of other monitoring mechanisms.
In the mid-1960s the Commission on
Human Rights began responding to human
rights violations, albeit in a very limited
number of situations. Since 1979 it has gradu-
ally and persistently expanded both the
number and diversity of countries subjected
to public monitoring and the range and
intrusiveness of the procedures it has been
prepared to apply. Ever-increasing numbers of
non-governmental organizations and victims
of human rights violations now participate in
the work of one or more of the bodies set up
by the Commission or its Sub-Commission,
and governments attest to the growing
potential of the United Nations to be effec-
tive by the lengths to which they go in order
to achieve membership of the Commission
and to influence its deliberations, as well as by
the occasional harshness of their denuncia-
tions of its actions.
Most recently the United Nations has
become heavily involved in the administra-
tion of human rights programmes of
unprecedented scope and importance in
countries such as El Salvador, Cambodia,
Haiti, Rwanda and Burundi. Electoral assis-
tance, which was such a novelty in Namibia
as recently as 1989, has developed into a
major United Nations activity, and technical
assistance in the human rights field has been
provided to a significant number of coun-
tries. The 1993 World Human Rights Con-
ference held in Vienna definitively identified
women's rights as having been subject to
unacceptable neglect in the past and as a
major priority concern for the future. The
following year the first United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights was
appointed. In brief, the international human
rights system has developed to an extent that
would have been considered inconceivable by
the vast majority of observers in 1945.
The challenge of universality
One of the biggest challenges facing interna-
tional human rights law in the post-Cold War
era is to establish beyond doubt its univer-
sality. When thé Universal Declaration was
drafted, many Third World countries had not
attained independence and were thus unable to
contribute. When the two International
Covenants were adopted in 1966 a far larger
number of them participated. Nevertheless the
Cold War tended to discourage adéquate dis-
cussion of cultural concerns because of the
pressure on many states to support either East
or West in the global ideological struggle. It
was only in the late 1980s that an energetic
debate began at the international level over
whether human rights are indeed universally
valid or are relative to each specific society.
Subsequently the Vienna Conférence2 reaf-
firmed that"the universal nature of these
rights and freedoms is beyond question".

While this is a vitally important development,
it does not once and for att eliminate the need
to take cultural diversity into account.
Once we move beyond the core rights of
physical integrity, the nature of the society,
its traditions and culture and other such fac-
tors become highly pertinent to any efforts
to promote and protect respect for the
rights concerned. We must recognize that the
intransigent approach that is appropriate in
relation to such core violations will simply
be less productive and achieve far less
enduring results than a more sensitive, open
and flexible approach which situâtes thé goais
sought within the society in question. The
precise requirements of what is often termed
the right to democracy is a case in point.
Human rights efforts will be enriched, not
compromised, by an approach that is, in
appropriate respects, more probing, more
self-conscious and more selective than that
which many countries have achieved to date.
It is also important to recognize that there
are conflicts among rights and that the reso-
lution of such conflicts requires greater
openness about the difficulties and a more
concerted attempt to accommodate the dif-
ferent values involved.
The problem of relativism
On the other hand it is essential to scruti-
nize claims of relativism on cultural, philo-
sophical or religious grounds. Many of the
claims made essentially reflect no more than
the age-old tendency of governments to jus-
tify thé cynicai and self-interested proposi-
tion that their own citizens neither want nor
need the protection of human rights.
In the development of the international
human rights system and in its application at
the national level, non-governmentai organiza-
tions have played an indispensable role. They
have contributed to the drafting of many of
the international standards ; they have devel-
oped a much greater awareness of human
rights among the public at large ; they have
constantly prodded governments to respect
their obligations, and they have assembled the
facts that have compelled other governments
to react to gross violations of human rights in
a wide range of situations. They have also
played a central role in responding to human-
itarian emergencies. Ironically, the fact that so
many governments have sought to suppress or
subvert them should be seen as a tribute to
their effectiveness.
There are various challenges ahead for non-
governmental organizations. They must be
accorded greater opportunities to contribute
to the work of international organizations,
including the United Nations, the United
Nations Development Programme, the
World Bank, the Organisation of African
Unity and the Organization of American
States. At the International ievet they need to
become both better co-ordinated and more
systematicaHy critical. They as a group need ta
work out how they can ensure that adequate
attention is accorded to economic, social and
cultural rights. Too many of the major
groups currently do no more than pay lip
service to these crucial rights.
Matching words with deeds
Thus while much has been achieved in half a
century, there remain many challenges. In the
years ahead governments must match their
fine words with deeds. The United Nations
human rights programme is radically under-
resourced and clearly incapable of dealing
with the tasks assigned to it. Economie,
social and cultural rights continue to be
largely neglected by the vast majority of
governments, despile thé rhetoricat commit-
ment of many. The result is that large-scale
problems such as chronic malnutrition and
lack of access to clean water, primary health
care, primary education and adequate shelter
are not considered human rights problems.
This approach is morally and legally unten-
able and the obligations undertaken by gov-
ernments and the international community
must be taken seriously. Universat ratifica-
tion of the six basic international human
rights treaties should be an urgent objective.
It must be followed by further strength-
ening of the Institutional arrangements
designed to help and, where necessary, to
pressure governments into respecting the
full range of their citizens'human rights,
just as they are pledged to do under the
Charter. M

A GUIDED TOUR OF THE UN SYSTEM
The Charter of the United Nations Organization (UNO) was
drafted between 25 April and 26 June 1945 at a Conference
bringing together the nations which had officially taken up
arms against the Axis powers prior to 1 March 1945. They set
out to create an instrument capable of preserving the newly
won peace and of managing it by perpetuating the Alliance
which, in spite of differences, had held together throughout
the Second World War.
Ratified by most of the signatory countries on 24 October'
1945, the Charter reflected the determination of those
countries to strive for the preservation of peace in order to
ensure respect for human rights,"social progress and better
standards of lifte in larger freedom". For this purpose, it offered
the nations a framework for international co-operation that
was unprecedented in human history.
The United Nations Organization, whose Headquarters is.
in New York (U. S. A.) is open to ail states which request to join
it, accept the obligations of its Charter and have the
determination and the means to fulfil them.
Pursuant to the terms of its Charter, the United Nations
Organization has six principal organs, which are empowered to
establish subsidiary bodies to assist them in their functions
and to conclude co-operation agreements with existing or new
international institutions which, after signing the Protocol,
acquire the status of specialized agencies (see organization
chart, pages 30-31).
The General Assembly, whose hrsi ses
sion was convened in London (United
Kingdom) from tOJanuaryto) 4Fcbru-
arv 1946, is composcd of representatives
of ail the Member States of the Organiza-
tion. It is thé main dchberativc organ, and
decisions are taken in it bv a simple
majority (with a two-thirds rnajority
being rcqutrcd for major questions), each
membcr having onc vote, without dis-
tinction as to its seize c or weatth. Thé Gên-
eral Assernblv decides on the admission
of new Mcmbers on the recommenda-
tion of the Securitv Council. The 1ll1l1l-
ber of Mcmber States rose from 76 in
1955 to 100 in 1960, 127 in 1970, 154 in
1980to 185 at the present time.
ID The General Assembh'rneets inannal sessions. In principle, the regular
Principal organs
session isconvened for thé thirdTues-
da\"in Scptcmbcr and continues until
mid-Dccembcr. Howcvcr, the Gênera !
Assembly may bc convcncd in special
sessions at a différent date and at a place
othcr than net York.
During a regular session, the General
Assembh'examines the agenda items in
plenary meeting and in eommittees. In
addition to thé Special Political and
Decoionization Committees, thcre are
currentlv fi\e other Main Committees
responsible respecti\"Clv for disarma-
ment and internationat sécurité' ; coco-
nomic and nnancia ! matiers ;  social,
humanitarian and cultural matters ;
administrative and budgeLllT matters ;
and ega) matters.
Thé Gênera) Assembla apprO\es the
budget, examines reports from other
United Nations organs, elects the mem-
bers of these organs if need be, appoints
the Secretarv-General on the recommen-
dation of thc Security Council, and dis-
cuisses anv question or issue within the
scope of thc Chaner or affecting the
powcrs and functions of anv organ of
the United Nations. It is not, however,
authorized to adopt resolutions on
points being discussed by thc Security
Counci).
The decisions of the Assemb) v hâve
no legally binding force, but they carry
thé welght of world opinion on major
international issues, as tell as thé moral
authority of the world community. The
work of thc United Nations derives
largely from the will of the majorait :, ouf
the Member States as expressed ion thé
résolutions of the General Assembiv.

The Security Council, which was estab-
lished on 12January 1946, is composed of
15 members, including five permanent
members designated by the Charter
(China, France, the Russian Federation,
the United Kingdom, and the United
States) and ten members elected by the
General Assembly in a rotation of five for
atwo-yearterm.
The keystone of the Organization,
the Security Council, is so organized as
to be able to function continuously and
it may meet elsewhere than at Headquar-
ters if considers this advisable. The sole
organ with the power of coercion, it
decides on enforcement measures, eco-
nomic sanctions and the intervention of
armed forces placed at its disposai by the
Member States, and has primary respon-
sibility for the maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security.
The Security Council is the only
organ of the United Nations where the
principle of equality of the states is
replaced by the mIe of"great power una-
nimity" (often referred to as the"veto"
power), whereby the negative vote of
only one of the five permanent members
of the Council is sufficient to block a
decision that has received the assent of
the fourteen other members, except in
regard to procedural questions.
The Economie and Social Council,
established on 13 January 1946, has 54
members elected for three years (with an
annual rotation of 18 members), who
meet once a year for five weeks. Its com-
petence extends to ail areas of economic
and social co-operation. Its year-round
work is carried out in its subsidiary
bodies, which include the following :
1'-naine commissions and technical
committees which are responsible in
particular for questions relating to sta-
tistics, population and development,
social development, human rights, the
status of women, narcotic drugs, science
and technology, sustainable develop-
ment, and crime prevention and criminal
justice ;
1'-five regional commissions, the main
instruments of decentralization of
United Nations action in the economic
and social fields, with offices at Addis
Ababa (Ethiopia) for Africa ; Santiago
(Chile) for Latin America and the
Caribbean ; Bangkok (Thailand) for
Eastern Asia and the Pacific ; Geneva
(Switzerland) for Europe ; and Amman
(Jordan) for Western Asia ;
.. seven standing committees, working
groups and expert bodies : for pro-
gramme and co-ordination, natural
resources, negotiations with non-gov-
ernmental organisations2 and intergov-
ernmental agencies, development plan-
ning, international co-operation in tax
matters, transport of dangerous goods,
and questions of UN administration
and public finance.
It Is through the Economic and
Social Council that the United Nations
specialized agencies co-ordinate their
economic and social work.
The Trusteeship Council, which now
cornes under the responsibility of the
Security Council, was assigned the task
of supervising the administration of
Trust Territories and of promoting their
advancement towards independence. It
has now achieved its objectives and the
last of the territories under the Trustee-
ship system, the Palau Islands, were
admitted to the United Nations in 1994.
The other territories, which were mainly
in Africa and the Pacific, acceded to inde-
pendence either as separate states or by
joining neighbouring independent
countries.
The International Court of Justice,
whose seat is at The Hague (Nether-
lands), was established on 6 February
1946. It is the principal judicial organ of
the United Nations and its Statute is an
integral part of the Charter. The Court is
composed of 15 judges, who are elected
for a term of nine years. They are chosen
by the General Assembly and the Secu-
rity CouncM on the basis of their qualifi-
cations, and not of their nationality-
although no two Judges can be nationals
of the same state. They may not engage
in any other occupation during their
term of office,
The Court adjudicates legal disputes
between States submitting their case to
it. Its rulings are binding on the parties
having accepted its jurisdiction. It also
gives advisory opinions on legal ques-
tions to the General Assembly, the Secu-
rity Council and other organs and spe-
cialized agencies of the United Nations.

The Secretariat services the other
organs of the United Nations and
administers the programmes and poli-
cies laid down by them. It analyses
worldwide economic and social trends
and problems, prepares studies, orga-
nizes conferences, monitors the extent
to which the decisions of UN bodies are
carried out, translates documents and
conducts information programmes on
the Organization's activities. Under
Article 100 of the Charter the staff of the
Secretariat undertake neither to seek nor
to receive Instructions from any govern-
ment or any authority external to the
Organization.
TheSecretary-General, thé Organiza-
tion's highest officiai, is appointed by
the General Assembly on the recom-
mendation of the Security Council for a
term of five years. In addition to his
administrative functions (he appoints
the staff, attends sessions of various
United Nations bodies, prepares the
budget and submits it for approval), he
is empowered to bring to the attention
of the Security Council any matter
which, in his opinion, threatens interna-
tional peace and security. United
Nations bodies entrust him more and
more frequently with a wide range of
political, diplomatic or conciliation
missions. Each year, he issues a report on
the activities of the Organization and its
prospects for the coming year. M

The United Nations International
Research and Training Institute for
the Advancement of Women,
which commenced activities in
1979, is an emanation of the World
Conference of the International
Women's Year (1975).
INSTRAW is an autonomous
body within the United Nations
system, whose main objective is to
contribute, through research,
training and information, to the
integration of women in the
economic and social development
process and to their participation
in allieveis of politicallife.
Over the past five years,
INSTRAW bas engaged in a wide
range of activities on women's
work in the informat sector, their
role in the media, the place they
occupy in credit, sanitation and
water supply programmes, and
the harnessing of new and
renewable energy sources. Its
programme of work for the 1994-
1995 biennium is centred on four
main themes : the improvement of
women's status ; statistics and
indicators concerning women ;
women, the environment and
sustainable development ; and
communication for development.
The Institute does not receive
annual subsidies under the
contributions to the United
Nations regular budget, and it
depends entirely on voluntary
contributions from UN Member
States, governmental and non-
governmental organizations,
foundations, and private and
other sources.

UNICEF'was established as a
temporary body in December
1946 by the General Assembly ta
provide emergency assistance ta
children in war-ravaged countries
of Europe. In 1953, it was placed
on a permanent footing and its
mandate was broadened to help
children in developing countries.
UNICEF promotes the
survival, protection and
development of children and their
mothers in such fields as health,
nutrition, education, water and
sanitation, and provides relief and
rehabilitation assistance in
emergencies (vaccines, basic
medicines, medical equipment
and food supplements). One of its
most important public health
achievements has been in
immunization. In what has been
called"the largest single
collaborative peace-time effort in
wor) d history", thé Universat
Child Immunization (UCI)
programme launched by
UNICEF and the World Health
Organization in 1984 successfully
vaccinated 80 per cent of the
world's children by 1990 against
six major childhood killer diseases
(measles, poliomyelitis,
tuberculosis, diphtheria,
whooping cough and tetanus),
thus saving the lives of some 9 to
10 million children in the
developing world.
UNICEF also supports the
implementation of the
Convention on the Rights of the
Child, which entered into force as
Internationa)) aw on 2 September
1990. As of mid-August 1995, the
Convention had been ratified by
177 countries.
Supported by 38 National
Committees, mostly in
industrialized countries, UNICEF
co-operates in programmes in 144
countries. It depends mainly on
voluntary contributions from
governmental and non-
governmental sources. Total
expenditure for 1994 amounted ta
$999 million.

In 1984 the General Assembly
decided that the activities of the
Voluntary Fund for the UN
Decade for Women should be
continued by the establishment of
a separate entity, UNIFEM, in
autonomous association with the
UN Development Programme
(UNDP).
UNIFEM seeks to improve the
lives of women in developing
countries, to promote the
involvement of women in the
decision-making process of
mainstream development
programmes, and their
achievement of equal status
through economic and social
development. UNIFEM considers
that the best approach is to
strengthen organizations created
and managed by women
themselves by providing direct
technical and financial support.
UNIFEM focuses its efforts in
three main fields :agriculture and
food security, trade and industry,
and national planning. The Fund
also seeks to provide women with
access to credit, training, science
and technology, information and
other tools of development, and
encourages links and partnership
between women at grassroots
level and national and
international institutions.

and training centres and
programmes, each specializing in
a particular field, which co-
ordinate the activities in which

Assembly. In 1965, the
Programme was extended"for as
long as multilateral food aid is
found feasible and desirable".
WFP provides food aid ta
developing countries both to
promote development and to help
alleviate emergencies. In 1994, 44
per cent ofWFP benenciaries (25
million people) were victims of
wars, ethnic conflicts and civil
strife in 41 countries. Another 13
per cent (7. 5 million people) were
afflicted by droughts and other
natural disasters in 8 countries.
Some 60 per cent of the

1 Director-General : Michel Hansenne
Origin : The ILO was established on 28 June 1919 (its
Constitution having become operative on Sil April)
by the Treaty of Versailles (France) as an autonomous
body associated with the League of Nations. On 14
December 1946, it became a specialized agency associ-
ated with the United Nations.
Administration : The International Labour Confer-
ence, a world parliament on labour issues, meets once
a year and is attended by delegations from ait the
member countries. Each delegation is composed of
two government delegates, one delegate representing
workers and one representing employers. The Gov-
erning Body, ILO's executive organ, comprises 28
government delegates (including 10 permanent dele-
gates, the others being elected for a term of 3 years),
14 employer delegates and 14 worker delegates. The
International Labour Office is the permanent secre-
tariat of the ILO.
Objectivés : To promote social justice and raise living
and working standards throughout the world.
Fonctions : Adopting international abour standards
(in the form of conventions and recommendations).
Every state ratifying a convention undertakes
thereby to apply it and accepts de facto the principle
of international monitoring. Recommendations,
which are not subject to ratification, provide guid-
ance for national législation and practice. Since it was
founded, ILO has adopted 174 conventions and 181
recommendations constituting the International
Labour Code in such areas as the fundamental rights
of working people (freedom of association, prohibi-
tion of forced labour, elimination of discrimina-
tion), wages, hours and conditions of work, public
employment services, social services, welfare protec-
tion schemes, job relations, protection of mothers
and children, migrants and certain categories of
workers, and labour inspection.
Activities : Activities connected with the setting and
monitoring of standards draw on work done in con-
nection with research and publications and on the
organization of technical meetings,'ln addition, a
wide-ranging technical co-operation programme is
carried out in liaison with other United Nations
organs. Through a policy of active partnership, ILO
provides Member States with expertise and advice in
aU its fields of competence, such as employment pol-
icy, vocational training, management techniques,
occupational safety and health, improvement of
social security systems, sectoral activities, co-opera-
tives and the strengthening of employers'and work-
ers'organizations. 
Observations : With a view to strengthening the effec-
tiveness of its legal arsenal against child labour (sev-
eral conventions on which were adopted between
1919 and 1973), in 1992-1993 ILO launched an Inter-
national Programme on the Elimination of Child
Labour (IPEC). This Programme is already opera-
tional in some ten countries and is making rapid
strides.

Origin : The International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion (ICAO) was founded with the signing of the
Convention on International Civil Aviation in
Chicago (U. S. A.) on 7 December 1944. The Conven-
tion entered into force on 4 April 1947 after its ratifi-
cation by 26 States. ICAO became a specialized
agency in October 1947.
Administration : ICAO is administered by an Assem-
bly comprising representatives ofaU its member coun-
tries, and by a Council composed of the representatives
of 33 countries elected by the Assembly for a term of
three years. The Assembly meets at least once every
three years to decide on the Organization's policy. The
Council is the executive body which applies the direc-
tives of the Assembly and administers the Organiza-
tion's finances ;it may act as a tribunal for the settlement
of any dispute relating to international civil aviation.
Objectives : To ensure the safe and orderly growth of
international civil aviation ; to encourage the design and
operation of aircraft and the development of airways,
airports and air navigation facilities for peaceful pur-
poses.
Functions and activities : Setting international stan-
dards governing practices for the design and perfor-
mance of aircraft, he qualifications and performance
of airline pilots, flight crews, air traffic ontrollers,
and ground and maintenance crews, security
requirements and procedures at international air-
ports, and the interdiction of illicit drug transporta-
tion by air ;formulating flight rules and aeronautical
charts used for international navigation ; helping
developing countries to establish or improve their air
transport systems and train their personnel. The har-
monization of international aircraft elecommunica-
tions systems-radio frequencies and security pro-
cedures-is also ICAO'S responsibility.

Cable : INTBAFRAD WASHINGTON
t President :James D. Wolfensohn
tNumberofmemberceuntries : 178
Origin : The World Bank is composed of four institu-
tions : the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD or the Bank), which was estab-
lished in 1945, a year after its Articles of Agreement had
been drawn up by a United Nations monetary and
nnanciai conference attended by 44 Governments at
Bretton Woods (U. S. A.) ; the International Finance
Corporation (IFC), created in 1956 ; the International
Development Association (IDA), created in 1960 ; and
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), created in 1988.
Administration : Ali powers in the Bank are vested in
the Board of Governors, composed of one Governor
and one alternate from each Member State. The Pres-
ident of the World Bank is ex officia President of the
four institutions.
The Development Committee is a forum bringing
together the Boards of Governors of the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to dis-
cuss international economic co-operation. The Inter-
national Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) is managed by a Board composed
of one representative of each Member State and
chaired by the President of the Bank.
Objectives : To improve living standards in develop-
ing countries by granting them financial resources
provided by the industrialized countries.
The International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD)
tNumberofmembercout) tries : 178
Functions : Assisting in the reconstruction and devel-
opment of territories ofits members by facilitating the
investment of capital for productive purposes (agricul-
ture, energy, education, health, family planning, roads,
telecommunications) ; promoting private foreign
investment on reasonable terms ; contributing to the
long-term development of international trade.
Activities : ln addition to granting loans, IBRD pro-
vides a wide range of technical assistance services. The
Bank's capital is subscribed by the Member States.
However, it finances its lending operations primarily
from its own borrowings in world markets, as we) t as
from retained earnings and repayments on its loans.
Observations : ln accordance with its Statutes, IBRD
can only make loans for productive purposes ; each
loan must be guaranteed by the Government con-
cerned and, except in special circumstances, must be
for spécifie projects. IBRD's lending decisions are
supposed to be based only on economic considera-
tions, but since 1980 it has also supported pro-
grammes for the readjustment of economic policies
and institutional reform.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC)
tNumberot member countries :162
Functions : Helping to finance private enterprise with-
out guarantee of repayment by the government con-
cerned ; bringing together investment opportunités
and stimutating the flow of private capitan, domestic
and foreign, into productive investment in member
countries.
Activities :Invests prirnarily in manufacturing, but
also in mining and energy, tourism and agriculture.
Observations : While closely associated with the
Wor) d Bank, the IFC is a separate legal entity and has
its own resources, which chiefly corne from the sub-
scriptions of its member countries and from accu-
mufatedpronts.
Activities : Grants credits over a period of 50 years,
usually interest-free. Repayment of principal do es
not begin until after a 10-year grâce period.
Obseroations : ID lis resources come from the net earn-
ings of the World Bank, capital subscribed in conveI1ible
currencies by its members, and contributions from its
richer members. In order to borrow from IDA, a coun-
try must meet four criteria : it must be below the
"poverty line" ;it must have sufficient economic, finan-
cial and political stability owarrant long-term develop-
ment lending ;it must have serious batance-of-payments
problems ; and it must have a genuine commitment to
development as re ftected inits policies.
The International Development Association (IDA)
. Number of member countries : 157
Functions : Providing the poor countries with loans
on much more flexible terms than IBRD.
The Multilaterallnvestment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA)
. Number of member countries : 128
Functions : Facititating the flow of private investment
for productive purposes by offering investors insur-
ance against long-term (up to 20 years) political and
non-commercial risks, such as currency non-con-
vertibility, expropriation, war and civil disturbance
and by providing advisory and consultative services.

tNumberof member countries :179
Origin : Established on 27 December 1945, following
the ratification of the Bretton Woods Agreements
(U. S. A., JuIy 1944-see entry on the World Bank).
Administration : The Board of Governors, composed
of one representative and one alternate for each mem-
ber country, meets annually ; it decides quotas and the
conditions of accession to the Fund. The Executive
Board is responsible for the conduct of the day-to-day
business of IMF. It is composed of 24 members (5 of
them appointed by the member countries having the
largest quotas'and 19 elected'by the others) and is
chaired by the Managing Director, who is elected by the
Board.
Objectives : To exercise surveillance over the eco-
nomic policies of its member countries ;foster mone-
tary co-operation, exchange-rate stability and the bal-
anced growth of international trade ; administer a code
of conduct regarding exchange-rate poiicies ; promote a
multilateral payments settlement system ; provide
member countries with the financial resources neces-
sary to help them correct their payments imbalances
without jeopardizing national prosperity ;foster their
mutual collaboration ; and provide technical assistance
as required.
Functions and activities : The IMF has the power to
allocate international reserve assets in the form of
SDRs.'It also provides financial support on conces-
sional terms for low-income member countries
under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF). The resources which the IMF can lend
corne mainly from the quotas of the member coun-
tries, in other words from their subscriptions to the
Fund's capital.'Each country pays a contribution cor-
responding to its economic size.'The IMF is autho-
rized to raise loans from officiai lenders m order to
supplement its resources, It may also draw on a line
of credit of SDR18. 5 billion (US$27 billion) which has
been opened by various countries under the"Gen-
eral Arrangements to Borrow" (GAB).
Observations : The IMF's lending policy is guided by
the following principles :any member country bor-
rowing a given currency is expected to return it as
soon as its payments problems have been solved, so
as not to limit other members'access to the same cur-
rency ; before taking a loan, the country must demon-
strate how it intends to solve its payments problems,
so that it can repay the Fund within a repayment
period of three to five years (but which may, if neces-
sary, be up to ten years).

tCurrentnumber : 105
t Director-General : Renato Ruggiero
Origin : The World Trade Organization was estab-
lished on 1 January 1995, replacing GATT (thé Gén-
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Triade2) upon comple-
tion of the Uruguay Round negotiations'. Whereas
G ATT was a multilateral treaty applying on a provi-
sional basis, WTO has the legal personality of a
fully-fledged international organization, like the
International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
Like GATT, however, it does not have the officiaI
status of a specialized agency of the United Nations,
although links have been established with it.
Objectives : To increase production, trade and
investment ; further the active participation of the
developing countries in world trade.
Functions : Administering and implementing the
whole range of multilateral trade agreements which
together form the Organization's structure ; fur-
thering international trade negotiations ;endeavour-
ing to setde trade disputes ; overseeing national trade
policies ;co-operating with the other international
institutions which participate in the formulation of
world economic policy.
Activities : The new multilateral trade system-
which is subtended by a number of fundamental
principles aimed in particular at ensuring the secu-
rity and predictability of trade in goods and ser-
vices-covers a volume of trade amounting to a value
of close on $6, 000 billion.
Untike GATT, WTO rules will cover commercial
activities such as trade in services, intellectual prop-
erty and investment. In GATT's traditional sphere
of activity, the rules on international competition
have been spelt out much more clearly, and tariff
barriers to trade will be significantly lowered, by an
average of 40 per cent over a six-year period. GATT's
conciliation system, which enabled it to settle dis-
putes between its members in a) i its areas of activity,
has been considerably strengthened. Technical co-
operation in favour of the developing countries has
also been improved.
1. Thèse are member countries of GATT which have completed
their legislative ratification procedures. Their number is expected ta
increase (o150 by thé end of 1995. GATT currently has 125
members.
2. GATT came into force on 1 January 1948.
J. ln order ta make for a smooth transition between GATT and
WTO and enable thé largest possible number of countries ta
complete theirratification procedures, GATT will continue to
function in parallel with WTO untilJl December 1995.

Origin : IAEA commenced its activities in Vienna
(Austria) in July 1957. In November of the same
year, the General Assembly of the United Nations
approved an agreement governing relations between
IAEA and the United Nations. IAEA is an indepen-
dent intergovernmental organization created under
the aegis of the UN. Although it does not have the
o fnciat status of a UN specialized agency, it submits
an annal report to the General Assembly and, if
necessary, to the Security Council and the Economic
and Social Council.
Administration : The General Conference, omposed
of aU the Member States, meets annually to adopt
the Agency's policy, budget and programmes. These
are implemented by the Board of Governors, which
is composed of 35 members (22 of whom are elected
for two years by the General Conference and 13 are
appointed for one year by the Board).
Objectives : To seek ta accelerate and enlarge the con-
tribution of atomic energy to peace, health and
prosperity throughout the world.
Functions : Ensuring that nuclear materials and
equipment intended for peaceful use are not
diverted to military purposes ;setting standards for
nuclear safety and environmental protection ; serv-
ing as an intermediary between Member States ;facil-
itating the transfer of technology, and providing
advisers, equipment and training services for the
developing countries ; managing an international
nuclear information system.
Activities : IAEA manages, jointly with UNESCO,
the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in
Trieste'and also maintains three laborataries'for
studies in basic nuclear physics applications and
practical uses in chemistry, physics, industrial
hydrology and oceanography.
Observation : Various types of safeguard agree-
ments can be concluded with IAEA. In accordance
with the terms of the agreements concluded in con-
nection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the Treaty for the Pro-
hibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America
(Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the South Pacific Nuclear
Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Rarotonga), non-
nuclear-weapon states are required to submit their
entire nuclear-fuel-cycle activities to IAEA safe-
guards.

Thé right to food is the most fundamentalof human rights. Throughout history
chronic hunger, whether caused by war, drought,
poverty or natural disaster, has led to widespread
suffering, and freedom from hunger remains a
long-cherished goal. Alongside peace, hunger is the
most pressing of ail issues.
There must be two principal components in
any strategy to eradicate hunger. One is to increase
food production in order to feed an expanding
world population. The second is to alleviate
poverty at least to the point where every person
has access to the food they need for a healthy life.
While the Food and Agriculture Organization
concentrates on helping to ensure sustainable
expansion of agricultural production and pro-
ductivity, we also promote the concept that,
where feasible, a greater emphasis by developing
nations on the agriculture sector can make a pow-
erful contribution to combating poverty. This
follows from the fact that the majority of the
poor in most developing countries depend on
agriculture for employment and incomes. As
long as this dependence continues, the growth of
food production and of agricultural produc-
tivity in the countries with high concentrations
of rural poverty will continue to be among the
principal means of alleviating poverty and
improving nutrition.
The dimensions of the hunger problem are
great. In the developing countries 800 million
people are chronically undernourished. Among
them, 192 million children under the age of five
suffer from acute or chronic protein and energy
deficiencies. Hundreds of millions more suffer ail-
ments such as retarded growth, blindness and
impaired vision or goitre because their diets lack
essential vitamins and minerais.
Progress has been made, both in absolute and
per caput terms. For example, the figure of 800
million undernourished people mentioned above
is down from 893 million in 1969-1971. It is pro-
jected to drop further to 730 million in 2010, a
figure which still represents an appalling level of
suffering and wasted human potential. Happily,
the number of undernourished people as a per-
centage of total population has declined appre-
ciably over the last two decades and is expected to
continue to drop.
At present, 88 nations fall into the category of
low-income food-deficit countries. Forty-four of
these are in Africa, 19 in Asia and the Pacific, nine
in Latin America, four in the Near East and 12 in

the states of the former Soviet Union. The net
food déficits of the developing countries arc
expected to continue to grow, and the developing
countries as a whole will soon turn from being net
agricultural exporters into net importers. These arc
alarming prospects given the difncutt balance of
payments situation and the unfavourable eco-
nomic prospects for many devetoping countries.
Nothing short of a significant upgrading of
the overatt devetopment performance of the lag-
ging economies, with emphasis on a more equi-
table sharing of the benefits, will free the world of
the most pressing food insecurity problems. The
only feasible option for an early and sustainable
improvement in food security is the enhancement
of the productivity and production of food. The
key to such gains is efficient technology, applied
to the commodities that can make a difference.
The basic goal of food security is one that peo-
plues, governments and the international commu-
nity hâve no alternative but to address. Yet certain
trends are not encouraging. Devetopmenta ! com-

developing country agriculture is declining.
Between 1981 and 1992, overaïï amounts dropped
from $12. 3 billion to $8. 5 billion, in constant 1980
U. S. dollars. During this period, agriculture's share
of total development assistance fell from 25 per
cent to 17 per cent.
l believe that now is the time to raise public
awareness and to promote political commitment
at the highest level for a global campaign to pro-
vide food security for a ! i. Thé Food and Agricul-
ture Organization will host a World Food
Summit in November 1996 to pursue this com-
mitment. Only a combination of faster, poverty-
reducing development and appropriate public
policy, both national and international, will ulti-
mately improve access to food by the poor and
eliminate chronic undernutrition. t

Agency (tAEA)

IAEA's activities are directly relevant to a
number of areas that are vital to the future
of our planet : the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons, energy, the environment and develop-
ment assistance.
The number of states acceding to the Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty (NPT) has grown significantly in
recent years, For example, several republics of the
former Soviet Union-notably Ukraine-along
with South Africa and, quite recently, Algeria have
joined the 169 countries which had already signed
the Treaty. This has led to the broadening of the
nuclear materials safeguards system, which now
covers more than 1, 000 installations ail over the
world. To perform this field work, IAEA has a
team of 200 inspectors and an annual budget of
some $68 million. It is currently envisaging the
introduction of new technical methods to increase
the effectiveness of monitoring operations.
On two occasions in recent years, this funda-
mental activity has corne up against major diffi-
culties-in Iraq and in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea. However, IAEA remains res-
olutely optimistic regarding its ability to con-
tribute substantially to the efforts deployed ta
circumscribe the danger which nuclear weapons
can still represent for world security, in spite of
the end of the Cold War.
With regard to the environment, the energy
sources chosen by a ! ! of us will continue to play
a fundamental role if we wish to hait the process
of degradation that is already we ! I under way. The
choice of a viable form of electricity production
in the coming decades will chiefly lie between
"polluting"fuels, such as coal, oil and gas (above
ail from carbon dioxide), and nuclear energy,
from which the emanations are negligible.El

on 6 August 1945.
It is up to every country to make its own
choice. Some 30 of our member countries have
adopted nuclear energy to provide at least part of
their electricity supply, and 17 per cent of world
electricity production is now nuclear-generated.
Some countries are opposed to its use as an
energy source, but ail are agreed that nuclear
energy should be exploited under the best pos-
sible safety conditions. It is from this standpoint
that IAEA is devoting considerable efforts to
enhancing the safety of nuclear installations, in
particular at the request of countries, including
those of the former Soviet Union and of Eastern
Europe, wishing to obtain thé Agency's opinion
and support in regard to the operation of their
nuclear power stations. Last year, the first Inter-
national Convention on Safety laid down stan-
dards in this area, to which some 50 countries
have already signified their assent.
Lastly, IAEA is also endeavouring to transfer
peaceful nuclear techniques in a number of fields
to its developing member countries. These
include the eradication of the tsetse fly and the
fruit fly by the sterile insect technique, the pro-
duction by radiation of mutant cultivated plants
that are more capable of withstanding crop-dev-
astating organisms or difficult climatic condi-
tions, the use of radioactive isotope tracers to
detect water resources, and the use of radiation in
combating cancer. IAEA attaches the utmost
importance to these transfers, which are a key fea-
ture of its work programme, t

Thé shortage of resources for developmentcaused by the world risis which followed
the collapse of the Soviet Union makes it essen-
tial that these resources should be rationally and
effectively managed.
With this in view, a number of innovations
have been introduced into the project cycle of the
International Fund for Agricultural Develop-
ment (IFAD), in order to make these projects
less costly and more suited to the real needs of
the Fund's clients. The resulting savings will be
used to strengthen operations in priority sectors.
IFAD is devoting increased attention to tech-
nical assistance. A lasting reduction in poverty
requires technologies of a new type that will be
both intrinsically suited to the purpose and
financially affordable. IFAD has applied itself to
persuading international research institutes to
shift their priorities and strategies and to give
prominence in their schedules to the needs of
small farmers and other disadvantaged people
living in rural areas. This preoccupation is at the
root of the Fund's efforts to foster partnerships
between national agricultural research systems in

the developing countries and international
research institutions.
IFAD also attaches special importance to the
elaboration of joint strategies and alliances with
other financing and development agencies. Such
collaboration has to go beyond the co-financing
of projects. IFAD's vast experience could be used
to advantage on a broader front in connection
with joint approaches to combating poverty in
rural areas. The idea is to establish a package of
programmes, centred on an IFAD-type project,
which would benefit from substantial funding
from other international financing agencies.
IFAD's grassroots projects could then be repro-
duced on a larger scale, which would considerably
increase their impact.

(WEF) are currently examining ways and means of
strengthening their collaboration in contending
with the interdependent problems of poverty and
the environment. Breaking the vicious circle of
rural poverty and the degradation of the environ-
ment has long been at the heart of IFAD'S con-
cerns, especially in connection with the Special Pro-
gramme for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
Through innovative projects and specialized studies
carried out under this programme, new ways have
been found of helping small farmers to protect the
environment by practising ecologically sustainable
agriculture. IFAD is intent on making the most of
this experience in the framework both of concerted
action with WEF and of the International Conven-
tion to Combat Desertification and Drought.
The coming years are likely to be difficult
ones. Resources will be limited, while needs will
keep on growing. It is imperative therefore that
every dollar at our disposât should be used as
effectively as possible. Success in banishing
hunger in twenty years, thirty years or a century
will depend on the sense of commitment of the
donor and beneficiary countries and on the inter-
national institutions. IFAD, in its modest and
positive fashion, is paving the ray. t
The Illernalional Monelary Fund (IMF)
In the last 50 years, many changes have taken
place in the world economy, all of which
have had an impact on the work of the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF). These changes have
included the emergence and growth of the devel-
oping countries-today there are almost 130 of
them among the IMF's 179 members ; the trend
toward greater symmetry in economic size among
the industrial countries ; the increased interna-
tional mobility of goods, capital, and labour, and
the associated international integration of mar-
kets ; the trend towards regional integration ; and
the integration of the formerly centrally planned
economies into the world market economic
system and the IMF itself.
But the influence has not been only one-way :
some of the changes can be attributed to a signif-
icant extent to the work of the IMF. Over the
years the IMF has corne to see more clearly that
macroeconomic policies need to be conducted
within a medium-term framework of monetary
stability and fiscal rectitude and have to be sup-
ported by structural, cost-effective social and
environmental policies ; that restrictions on cap-
ital flows are generally not to be recommended as
an instrument of policy ; that the requirements
of maintaining pegged exchange rates, especially
in the face of increasingly voluminous and agile
international capital markets, as revealed by the
Mexican crisis, are demanding.
These developments have been reflected in each
of the IMF's three major areas of activity.
First, in the provision of financial assistance :
one major change is the concentration of the
IMF's financing operations in recent years on
developing countries and countries in transition

Monetary Fund
(IMF) in

(U. S. A.).
and the introduction of new financing facilities
operating in a more flexible framework. These
adaptations have enabled the IMF to continue
serving the needs of countries in balance of pay-
ments difficulties, to play its role in resolving the
debt crisis and recent systemic crisis in Mexico,
to make its contribution to growth-oriented
adjustment in the developing countries, and ta
play its full role in Russia and the other transi-
..
tison économies.
Second, the IMF has adapted its role in the
exchange rate system. It has responsibility for
exercising"firm surveillance"over the exchange
rate policies of members, which involves surveil-
lance over all policies impinging on exchange
rates. IMF surveillance is conducted through reg-
ular-usually annual-consultations with indi-
vidual member countries, and through consider-
ation of policy issues in a global context. This has
been and remains the IMF's principal means of
promoting exchange stability.
The third main area of IMF activity is the
provision of technical assistance to member gov-
ernments in its areas of expertise, including fiscal
policy, central banking and monetary policy, and
economic statistics. There has been a dramatic
growth in demand for these services in recent
years, especially to help with institution-
building in the countries in transition, t

Promoting social justice in the closing years
of the 20th century, marked as they are by
globalization and the triumph of the market
economy, entails taking a firm stand on principles
that are deemed to be essential and adopting imag-
inative strategies. What values should be defended ?
What changes should be made ?
Tripartism is both the cornerstone of the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) and
the feature that makes it fundamentally different
from the other United Nations organizations.
By associating representatives of governments,
employers and workers in ail its deliberations
and decision-makins, ILO ensures that its action
is relevant, topical and effective with regard both
to the setting of standards and their practical
application. However, while ILO is intent on
remaining the social conscience of the world, it
will also have to study ways and means of gath-
ering round it the other intermediary groups
working for the promotion of social justice.
Setting international labour standards and
monitoring their application continues to be the
prime function of ILO. All the views expressed on
the occasion of the Organisation's 75th anniver-
sary in 1994 culminated in reaffirming their use-
fulness and universal value. However, an effort has
to be made to adapt their contents to present-day
realities and improve their effectiveness in practical
terms. The ILO's Governing Body has embarked
on this process. It will endeavour in particular to
draw up a conceptual framework for the revision
of existing standards and the adoption of new
ones. At the same time, ILO will set out to pro-
mote wider acceptance and greater respect for the
standards through its monitoring system and the
direct assistance it provides to its membership.
However, at a time when unemployment has
become the major social blight in most economies,
worker protection cannot be dissociated from job
promotion. In other words, it is necessary to deal
with both labour law and the right to work.
In this perspective, ILO has just published
the. first volume of its World Labour Report,
which presents a global analysis of the situation
in this field, together with proposais aimed at
shifting the emphasis of national and interna-
tional policies in a direction more conducive to
employment and social justice. N

Urgent, practical, solutions are crucial if the
world is to cope with the demands of its
expanding population. The role of industrializa-
tion is central to confronting the causes and effects
of this human explosion as well as to ensuring a
better life for the three quarters of humankind
who live in developing countries.
A complex range of development problems
have to be tackled in most of these countries,
from the provision of basic necessities to the cre-
ation of jobs, raising income levels and using non-
renewable resources efficiently.
Industrialization offers a number of answers
to this growing human and economic dilemma.
Slow industrial and economic growth, which
goes hand-in-hand with poverty, is as much a
cause of rapid population growth as an effect.
To break this vicious circle, a comprehensive
programme is needed, combining socio-eco-
nomic and industrial development.
In the highly competitive international envi-
ronment that has corne to prevail throughout the
world, especially in the aftermath of the
Uruguay Round of trade agreements,'industrial
and technological growth is more crucial than
ever for the economic survival of the South. As
new challenges emerge for developing nations and
economies in transition, the demand for indus-
trial services is increasingly at the forefront of
development issues.
The future of UNIDO lies in providing the
services essential to meet the demands of industrial-
ization today and into the next century.
Responding to the recent dramatic changes in the
world's economic environment, the Organization
has just undergone a major transformation,
making it more responsive to the needs of devel-
oping countries and economies in transition.

In 1993, UNIDO's Member States adopted the
Yaoundé Declaration calling for a series of far-
reaching reforms of the Organization. The aim was
to build on the strengths gained from more than
two decades of experience in serving the needs of
the developing world. These strengths include the
Organization's impartial, non-profit status, its
multidisciplinary capabilities and the industrial
expertise of its staff, as well as its experience in
technical co-operation at policy, institutional and
enterprise levels and its broad knowledge of
industrial development issues.
Five development priorities were set to
guide the Organization's new course : industrial
and technological growth and competitiveness ;
human resource development ; equitable develop-
ment through industrialization ; environmentally
sustainable industrial development ; international
co-operation in industriel investment and tech-
nology.
With a streamlined management structure and
refocused priorities, the Organization is now in a
better position than ever to meet the development
challenges of the 1990s and beyond. N

Spectacular though they are, thé changesthat hâve taken place on the communica-
tions market in recent years appear only to be the
precursors of even greater upheavals.
It is in preparation for these upheavals that the
Universal Postal Union has equipped itself with
two new Councils separating the governmental
function (the Council of Administration) from
the operational function (the Postal Operations
Council). In addition, the development of strategie
planning and programme budgeting now makes it
possible for UPU to define its objectives more
clearly and to make a more accurate assessment of
the resources necessary for their fulfilment.
UPU's current strategy, which was adopted at
its Congress held in Seoul in 1994, is aimed at two
essential points : improving the quality of services
and securing greater management autonomy.
In the first place, UPU is intent on ensuring
that postal administrations set satisfactory dis-
tribution standards, take steps to ensure that
their customers are properly informed and then
watch over the strict application of those stan-
dards. UPU's International Bureau measures the
global quality of services and informs the postal
administrations concerned of any departures
from the norm, so that steps can be taken to
remedy them.
Thé International Bureau has also designed and
set up a world Electronic Data Interchange project
(EDI), which connects postal exchange offices at
the points of origin, transit and destination, sur-
face and air transport companies and customs
authorities to a standardized electronic communi-
cations network. EDI technologies will also help
improve and speed up accounting procedures, the
compilation of statistics on volumes of mail by
categories and destinations, and the monitoring of
quality of service. The goal is to ensure that the
largest possible number of developing countries
will be able to benefit from EDI at the earliest
opportunity.
Since they are obliged to offer universal services
at affordable prices, postal administrations are
subjected to considerable economic pressures con-
nected with competition and technological
progress. The demands of the international market
have accordingly compelled them to transform
their legal status. In order to make sure that dereg-
ulation and liberalization will be effective, it is
essential for governments to allow postal adminis-
trations sufficient autonomy over their human
and financial resources. Government-controlled
postal administrations are therefore being con-
verted into independent or semi-independent
public companies that are progressively adapting
to a competitive international market.
In this new economic and technological envi-
ronment, UPU is continuing to be the main
channel of co-operation between postal services
and is thereby contributing to the maintenance of
a worldwide network of modern products and
services, tIl

DIFFERENT PRIORITIES
A typica ! example is to be found
in Culture and Agriculture, a
remarkable document puhlished
by the secretariat of UNESCO's
Worid Décade for Cultural Devei-
opment :"When project officers
se'impIe ment a co
fa project in Nopal a
years ago, they wanted to do the
right thing,"writes Vicki L.
Wilde."They went directly to the
villagers and asked what kind of
trees they wanted to plant.'Hard-
wood trees'was the answer, so the
project provided 3, 000 harowood
seedlings-and ail 3, 000 seedIings
subsequently died from lack of
care. Why ? Because the project
officers... consulted only the
male villagers, who were only
interested in wood for furniture-
making and carving that could
earn them cash. But, by tradition,
it was the women who planted and
watered tree seedlings."
The women were not interested
in slow-growing trees. As they
spent six hours a day coUecting
fuel and fodder, they would have
preferred fast-growing species to
ease their burden.
Another graphic example of
the relation between gender and
development cornes from southern
India, where women used to earn
their living n tea planta-
tions. When technology
was introduced into tea produc-
tion, it was the men who were
taught how to use it and they took
over the women's jobs. It was soon
noticed that the chiidren in the
area were beginning to suffer from
increased malnutrition. The reason
was that women had lost their
source of income, and in house-
holds in this part of India it was
they who were responsible for
earning the money to buy food ;
the men spent their money in
other ways.
The Food and Agriculture
more than half the earth's
copulation are women.
Although they account for
two-thirds of all the hours worked
in the world, women receive only a
tenth of the total earnings. Two-
thirds of them suffer from the
handicap ofiHiteracy. UNESCO has
always sought to remedy the
inequalities of which women are
victims, and action to improve
women's status is a common
denominator of programmes in aIl
its fields of competence.
But while there is no signifi-
cant difference in status
between, for example, male and
female astronauts trained in the
industrialized countries, the sit-
uation is quite different in
regions where women still bear
so} e responsibility for family
care, work in the fields and main-
taining water supplies. As Sabine
Estier wrote in Le Journal de
Genève of 5 June 1995 :"Con-
trary to a widespread assump-
tion, women do not naturally ben-
efit from overall development. In

Organization of the United
Nations concluded in 1989 that
only 5 peI'cent of agricultural
extension resources worldwide
were directed at female farmers.
That state of affairs was largely
due to three mistaken assump-
tions on the part of many develop-
ment planners : that men and
women benefit equally from eco-
nomic growth ; that if yod rais
men's income you improve the wel-
fare of the whole family ; and that
poverty and wealth are distrib-
uted equally within a household.
WHO DOES WHAT ?
"The division of responsibilities is
very much a part of the culture of
a country,"Wilde goes on,"but it
can also vary greatly from village
to village depending on tradition,
social customs, the economics, the
environmental situation and the
degree of development."She cites
two examples from the moun-
tainous Khao Kho region ofnorth-
eastern Thailand. Among the
Hmong people, women are their
husbands'property and handle
household chores. Men are in total
control. Among the Thais, farther
down the mountain, men and
women share most tasks, even
housework.
Yet another situation was
found in a community in the
United Republic of Tanzania
where, according to a survey car-
ried out by the World Health
Organization (WHO), 60 per cent
of the children aged between one
and seven suffered from trachoma
(contagious conjunctivitis which
can tead to blindness), while a fur-
ther 10 per cent had severe eye
disease. As transmission of the dis-
ease is curbed by improved
hygiene, mothers were advised to
wash their children's faces, which
they did not normally do. A whole
series of problems resulted from
that straightforward piece of
advice. Women, who are in charge
of fetching water and its use in the
household, attempted to justify
their reluctance to wash their
children's faces by saying there
was not enough water. In fact they
had plenty, as a we ! I had been
sunk not far off. They also alleged
they did not have enough time.
Yet they refused to allow anyone
else to go and fetch the household
water in their place, even though
it would have made their hard
work in the fields (ten hours a day)
easier to bear.
The difficulty of changing this
behaviour pattern can be more
easily understood if it is seen in
the context of a patriarchal
society where women cannot

ject to pump water to villages was
established, howcver, it failed to
acknowledge women as individuals.
Traditionally, only men can own

scheme only men were granted.

A HEAVY ENERGY BILL
Satisfying daily energy needs is a
massive hurden on women in devel-
oping countries."ln low-income
countries such as Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia and Nepal, the house-
hold sector accounts for more than
90 per cent of total energy con-
sumption,"says E. Cecelski in a
WHO document entitled Women,
Health and Environment."Use of
tree, crop and animal residues for
fuel deprives the soil of recycled
nutrients and reduces crop yields
along with the land's capacity to
support livestock."

Rajasthan (tnf) ta).
Four hundred million tonnes
of animal residues are burned in
this way in Asia and Africa every
year, causing a 20-million-tonne
shortfall in cereal production. In
ordér to obtain the same harvest
as before, women therefore have
to cultivate larger fields and work
even harder.
Ail these examples show that
the Action 21 programme drawn
up at the 1992 Rio Conference
still has a long way to go before
becoming effective. Responsi-
bility for the environment is still
not equaMy shared between men
and women. For this to happen,
it will be necessary"to put an
end to gender-based discrimina-
tion and allow women access to
the land and other resources, as
well as to education and secure
employment under conditions of
equality."Women should be pro-
vided with access to decent
housing, to a freety chosen
spacing of births and to health
care, and should no longer have to
suffer the horrors of war.
At the present time they mostly
have to go against the wishes of the
men in their family and the tradi-
tions of their community in order
to win their rights. But greater
access to resources can guarantee
liberation and social progress. The
increasing number of international
conferences devoted to women's
issues should help to change their
image and increase their powers.
After ail, in the symbolic tradition
of many civilizations, woman is not
only the Earth that gives birth to
living creatures and vegetation, but
also water, that seed of seeds on
which ail growth dépends. M
HUNTERS-A Mach
MALIGNED SPECTRES
in 1937 there were 6. 9 million hunters in
the United States. They now number 15. 5
million, about 7 per cent of the population. If
their spokespersons are to be believed, far
from behaving like ruthless predators, they
respect the balance of nature. At the turn of
the century, there were fewerthan 500, 000
white-tailed deer, about 40, 000 elk and a
bare 100, 000 wild turkey, whereas numbers
now stand at 18 mi ! ! ion, 800, 000 and 4. 5.
million respectively. What is more, the var-
ious taxes paid by hunters make a contribu-
tion of over $1 billion a year to wildlife con-
servation efforts. A ! ! thé more reason why
they resent the unflattering picture painted
ofthembythemedia. t
BAGS Ouf POLLUTION
! n France alone, 17 billion plastic bags are
used each year. The French Plastic
facturers'Union puts their
weight at the equivalent of
A320 aircraft. The trouble is that 60 per
cent of the bags eventually end up as
waste. When the industry has succeeded in
producing truly biodegradable plastics that
will no tonger potiute the ocean
world's finest beauty spots, the
be a cleaner piace. t
PEA CREEM PLASTICS
! n October 1994, 3, 000 hectares of wrin-
kled peas wereharvested in Bavariaanq
Saxony (Germany). A Bavarian processing
factory then extracted proteins and starch
from them. The starch is the raw material
for biodegradable plastics that go into the
manufacture of car interiors, especially
dashboards. N
THE ACHELOOS
DIVERSION
The newsletter of the Ramsar Convention
on Wetlands describes a controversy that
hasbeenrag ! ngforthe ! ast30yearsin
Greece and elsewhere in Europe. The
Ache ! oos, whichwasworshippedasariver
god in Antiquity, rises in the Pindos moun-
tains in northwestern Greece. Its estuary,
which forms the Missolonghi wetlands, is
on the Ramsar List of Wet ! ands pf Merna-
tional Importance. However, there are
highly controversial plans to build several
dams and hydroelectric power-stations
atong the river and to divert some of its
waters towards the plain of Thessa ! y via a
tunnel. As opinions on the subject are
sharply divided, the Greek government has
asked a group of consultants to make an
environmentaf assessment. Work on the
Messochora dam has not been halted, how-
ever. The four non-governmental
tions opposed to the project
gested that a thorough study

IODIZED IRRIGATION
The Chinese have come up with an answer
to the problem of iack of iod ! ne, which can
cause goitre and mental deficiency. Instead
of iodizing table salt, they have tried putting
a solution of 5 per cent potassium iodate in
the water of irrigation cana ! s in southern Xin-
jiang, a rural region west of Shanghai.
Results have been excellent : the iodine con-
tent of the soil has tripled, and that of crops
and fodder doubied. Thé opération did not
need to be repeated until the following year,
as the iodine content of the soil remained
stable throughout the winter. The operation
costs remarkably little : 5 U. S. cents per

FRANCE S COASTHE
CONSERVATION
COMMISSION
Since it was established in 1975, France's
Coastline Conservation Commission has
acquired almost 45, 000 hectares of land
along the seaboard, along with lakes cov-
ering an area of over 1, 000 hectares, and
sites on estuaries and deltas. Ten per cent
of the French coastline has already been
protected in this way. The purchases, which
are mainly paid for by the state, have been
made by mutual agreement in 85 per cent
of the cases. Management of the 339 sites
acquired in this way has been entrusted to
local authorities, nature conservation asso-
ciations or farmers. The aim is to prevent
any new buildings from being erected,
demolish those disfiguring the landscape,
and ban motor traffic and campsites, while
at the same time providing proper recep-
tion facilities for visitors, who last year
numbered 15 million. The purchase of a
further 60, 000 hectares is planned over
the next few years. The Conservation Com-
mission recently participated in the setting
up of a similar agency in Tunisia. N
OOKING BEANS WITB
SUGAR CANE
The Pan-African News Agency (PANA) reports
an interesting initiative in Sudan. The
country's first factory for turning sugar-cane
waste into fuel was brought into operation
in May 1995 by the Sudan Development Cor-
poration. It makes combustible bricks from
a mixture of molasses and bagasse (cane
residues after sugar extraction), thus elimi-
nating the need to fell trees for charcoal pro-
duction. The bricks cost 75 per cent less to
produce than charcoal. This ingenious
process makes it possible to cook a potful
of beans for only 200 Sudanese pounds, or
five times less than the cost of using fire-
wood. The factory plans to process 6 million
tonnes of bagasse a year, the equivalent of
8, 000 tonnes of fusel..
ations and Organizations, tells u that the
volcanlc Lake Nyos, in Cameroon, has at
last been degassed. It was the scene of a
disaster in 1986, when 1, 700 people were
asphyxiated by emanations of carbon
dioxide from the waters of the lake, which
contains huge quantifies of the gas. At the
time, UNESCO held a scientlfic conference in
Yaoundé, in conjunction with the Govern-
ment of Cameroon. ! n 1992, a Franco-
Cameroonian team succeeded in extracting
carbon dioxide from neighbouring Lake
Monoun. in March this year, the degassing
of Lake Nyos-a much more difficult task
because it is 200 metres deep and its
waters are saturated with the gas-was
successfully carried out. But the"killer
lakes"will have to remain under surveil-
lance. The degassing technique developed
by the Geophysical Instrumentation Labo-
ratory in Chambéry (France) could prove to
be useful in other parts of the world,
notably in Indonesia..
A GOOD

FOR HOTELS
The United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) has just published (in English) an.
"Environmental Action Pack for Hotels",
whose appearance is particularly timely in
view of the growth of tourism. The pack pro-
vides hoteliers with information enabling
them to implement a recommended plan of
action by taking practical steps in such areas
as water, wastes and energy, and to monitor
their performance with the help of check-
listes..
