T E R V I E W
ANDRÉ BRINK
talks to
Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat
André Brink, one of South Africa's leading novelists,
has resisted apartheid through his writing since the
1960s. Long banned within South Africa but translated
into many languages, his novels have brought him an
international reputation. They include: Looking on
Darkness (1974); A Dry White Season (1979); A Chain of
Voices (1982); The Wall of the Plague (1984); States of
Emergency (1988); and An Act of Terror (1991).
In this interview he talks about his life and convictions
and reveals some of his ideas about the future of his
country and of his work.
Given your background, what ledyou to
turn against apartheid?
I grew up in a very conservative
Afrikaner family. My father was a magis¬
trate, one of those grey eminences who
are the powers behind the throne in South
Africa because they implement the offi¬
cial policies. In his case it was done with a
real sense of justice; most of the others
were bigots. I know, because throughout
my childhood and adolescence I was sur¬
rounded by such people, the pillars of an
evil ideology. The opportunity never arose
for me to question apartheid because I
didn't have anything to compare it with. I
needed to see my country in perspective,
and that only happened when I was living
in Paris, between 1959 and 1961, at the
time of the Sharpeville massacre.
Sharpeville was the shock that forced me to
see what was happening in my country,
with the clarity that distance can provide.
At the same time I made another dis¬
covery. For the first time, I had the oppor
tunity to meet black people on equal terms.
The only black people I had met in South
Africa had been workers or domestic ser¬
vants. I'd never even imagined that there
could be black lawyers, teachers or stu¬
dents! And suddenly there I was in Paris
surrounded by black students some of
whom in fact knew more about literature
than I did after studying it for seven years.
It was a cultural shock, a very pleasant
shock, what's more, a discovery that
opened up entirely new horizons for me. It
was a voyage of discovery into unknown
territory.
There were obstacles and threats in store
when you went back to South Africa. How
didyou begin to detach yourselffrom your
background?
When I got back to South Africa, I had
no idea at first what to do about my new
discoveries. For almost ten years, Albert
Camus and the literary and philosophical
ideas I'd encountered in Paris were the
main influence on my writing. In a way I
used them to avoid exploring my own
roots roots of which I was a little
ashamed, to be honest. I wanted to focus
my attention on Europe, which for me
was the peak of civilization.
So during that time my writing was
existentialist in style and mood. It was
only when I went to live in Paris a second
time that I realized that I needed to go fur¬
ther and accept my African origins. Today
the best thing about being a South African
writer is to have two sets of roots, one lot
European, the other African.
When I returned to South Africa in
1961, 1 was appointed to a post as lecturer
at an English-language university with a
more liberal tradition than the very con¬
servative Afrikaner university where I had
myself studied. The atmosphere at this
university helped me to gain self-confi¬
dence. I met a number of blacks there, stu¬
dents and professional people. Slowly I
became aware of the situation of black
people in South Africa. But I still didn't
really know what to do about it.
In 1967 1 decided to leave the country.
I had just got divorced, and I had no more
social or family reasons to stay there. I
had made friends in Paris, writers and

painters, and at that time I thought of Paris
as paradise. I took a year's leave, which
could be extended if necessary, and
returned to Paris with the secret intention
of staying there for good.
How did you get on with your family
between these two trips?
Relations were very difficult to begin
with. My father sensed that I was cutting
loose, and we talked things over. Our rela¬
tionship was very ambiguous. On the one
hand we had very strong family feelings,
but as far as politics was concerned, a gulf
had opened up between us. We had several
fierce arguments before we realized that we
had no common ground, politically
, speaking. So we took a calm, rational deci¬
sion not to talk about politics any more.
What really triggered your change of
heart?
I think it was the ideas of Albert Camus.
I was in Paris at the time of the Algerian
war and all the problems it caused in
France, the time when Camus was writing
about the pieds noirs, the French settlers in
Algeria. I'd started reading Camus before
I went to France, and he died a few months
after I arrived there. For me his death was
a shock that gave an extraordinary signif¬
icance to his work.
Were you influenced by Sartre?
Not much. I read Sartre before I read
Camus. Intellectually, I admired Sartre
very much. But Camus bowled me over,
emotionally and morally. Sartre affected
me intellectually, but that was all.
As you describe it, your relationship
with Europe at that time was almost as
strong as your relationship with South
Africa. Was that true of many of your
fellow-countrymen ?
No, only a few of them. I found that
there were five or six other young
Afrikaner writers who like myself were
interested in novels and the theatre and
who had also lived in Europe, especially
Paris. We hadn't met in Paris, but we got in
touch after returning to South Africa. What
we experienced was something akin to that
"bliss to be alive" the English Romantics
had talked about. We were aware of doing
something that had never been done before
in Afrikaans, where the narrative tradition
had always reflected a very conservative
nationalism and the usual subjects of lit¬
erature were the lives of poor whites,
drought, agricultural problems. We had
had enough of that.
We were condemned by the authorities
for writing European-style novels. Ser¬
mons were preached against us in the
churches. Our books were accused of
moral, sexual and religious subversion by
the Directorate of Publications. They were
even publicly burned. But we didn't suffer
any political persecution, because we all
hesitated to take the final step into politics.
But while the authorities condemned us,
we got an enthusiastic reception from the
younger generation, the students, who
were as fed up with the older type of liter¬
ature as we were.
Altogether, though, it was a disturbing
time. It wasn't easy to live with the distress
of being rejected by our parents' genera¬
tion. We had grown up as part of a tradition
of blind obedience to previous genera¬
tions, accepting without discussion what
had been said in the past.
M How far did this conflict go ?
At that time it was while I was writing
my novel The Ambassador I went so far
as to criticize religion, which for Afrikaners
is the cornerstone of morality. I became an
atheist, rejecting both religion and con¬
ventional morality lock, stock and barrel.
My parents took this very hard and I was
severely criticized. But because there were
other writers around who shared my ideas
and because we had the support of the
younger generation, I didn't feel ostra¬
cized. Usually, when the authorities turned
against someone, it was disastrous. The
victims were crushed. Some turned to
drink and became alcoholics. But we had
the support of the younger generation, we
didn't care what the authorities said. And
since they didn't want to alienate an entire
generation, they were afraid to go too far.
They didn't really know what to do with
us.
M But at that stage you had still not ques¬
tioned the idea of racial inequality.
No, not really. Sometimes I would dare
to drop a phrase into an article or a book to
the effect that "We're all equal" or "Things
have got to change", but I'd not really
thought it through. My critical faculties
focused mainly on matters of religion, sex
and morality. I think I was afraid to ques¬
tion the foundations of the regime. That
was another reason for leaving South
Africa.
The most decisive year of my life was
1968. 1 was in Paris during the events of
May, which raised the whole question of

the responsibility of the individual towards
society and made me ask myself what I as
a writer wanted to do in my own society.
I realized that it would be too easy to stay
on in Paris and enjoy a pleasant life with
my friends, criticizing what was happening
over 10,000 kilometres away in South
Africa. I had to make a commitment, open
up a dialogue with my own society. I had
to do what the Paris students were trying
to do, which was to change society.
I suddenly realized that my African
roots were my most precious possession. I
wanted to go back, and I knew that it
wouldn't be easy. In late 1968 some South
African politicians and journalists came
to see me in Paris, and they warned me
that if I stayed there much longer, it would
be impossible for me to return. The author¬
ities knew about everything I had written
that year in Paris. Some of my articles had
even been published in South Africa, where
they had attracted fierce criticism.
So you were still being published in
South Africa, in spite of all the restric¬
tions. Was itpossible at that timefor white
people to live freely in South Africa,
tainted though it was by racism?
I think I benefited from the fact that I
was an Afrikaner. It was as though every¬
thing had to be kept in the family, that
allowances could be made for difficult chil¬
dren. And maybe too because I had never
openly challenged government policy. But
I knew at the end of 1968 that if I went
back, my writing would in future be polit¬
ically committed, and that I would really
have to step out of line. I knew that there
were dangers ahead, but I had made up
my mind. It had become very important
for me to go back, to write on the spot
and to accept full responsibility for my
work.
It was a decision that required a lot of
reflection. But once I had taken it I never,
even in the darkest days of the 1970s, had
any doubt that it was the right one.
Why didyou take that decision? Was it
because you felt that, as a writer, you were
getting cut offfrom your source of inspi¬
ration, from the daily life of the land and
itspeople?
Very much so. In deciding to go back, I
wanted to use all the South African mate¬
rial I could, but above all I wanted to find
out new things. For the first time in my life,
I was fascinated by Africa. I wanted to
explore the land, its history, its geography,
the people. . . . For the first time I was
seeing it as my own country, and I wanted
to learn all I could about it.
I had no sooner got back than I found
myself in trouble with the authorities over
some university lectures I gave. The first
novel I published after my return was
Looking on Darkness, which was also the
Left and opposite page: two scenes from A
Dry White Season (1989), a film by Euzhan
Palcy based on the novel by André Brink.
first book in which I openly criticized the
country's political system. I questioned
the laws on racial segregation and the ban
on marriage between blacks and whites.
It was the first novel in Afrikaans to be
banned. Until then only English-language
writers had been banned. It was an extra¬
ordinary thing for a member of the
Afrikaner family to provoke such a reac¬
tion. From then on, however, Afrikaner
writers were banned more and more often.
The Afrikaner literary establishment was
dumbfounded, and raised its voice against
the authorities for the first time. The silent
consensus that had always existed within
the community you weren't supposed
to mix politics and literature, culture was
something apart suddenly dissolved.
With my work banned, I suddenly
found that I had lost my audience, because
I only wrote in Afrikaans. So I decided to
push things further by translating the novel
into English, so it could reach a public
outside South Africa. I was furious with the
authorities for annexing Afrikaner art, cul¬
ture and history to the ideology of
apartheid. I wanted to show that Afrikaner
culture was bigger than that, that it had to
break free from apartheid, that when
apartheid finally disappeared Afrikaner
language and culture would continue.
From that time on I wrote separate
Afrikaans and English versions of my
novels; in A Chain of Voices I used the
languages alternately. Nowadays my read¬
ership in South Africa is half Afrikaner
and half English-speaking.
Didyou have a long-termplan in mind
when you returned to South Africa, or did
you simply criticize the existing state of
things?
In those days there was no grassroots
movement for an Afrikaner who wanted to
become politically involved, as there was
later, in the 1980s. The A.N.C. was a
banned organization at that time. You felt
very much on your own when you wanted

<![CDATA[
to do something. I wanted to play a part in
smashing the inhuman apartheid system. I
had some vague idea of replacing it with a
democratically-elected government in
which blacks and whites would be citi¬
zens on an equal footing, with a black-
majority government. I knew where I
wanted to go, but I didn't know how to get
there.
You must have had increasing contact
with the black community?
Yes. It caused me a lot of problems, but
I also made some wonderful discoveries.
After Looking on Darkness was banned,
more and more black people heard about
me and came to me for help. So I became
increasingly involved in their everyday
lives. In human terms it was a unique expe¬
rience, and it opened up a new world for
me. Some of the people who came to see
me became very close friends. Through
them I began to get a clearer idea of the
black experience. But I'd never be so pre¬
sumptuous as to say that I know what it's
like to be black in South Africa.
1/nA Chain of Voices, you identify with
the character ofa black slave. That was an
audacious thing to do, wasn't it?
Yes. I had shared so many close and vio¬
lent experiences with black people that I
wanted to put myself in their place and
imagine what they really felt. It was a chal¬
lenge to me as a writer.
My increasingly close relations with
black people, and the growing militancy of
the books and articles I published in the
1970s, attracted the attention of the police.
I and my family were put under permanent
surveillance. We were followed wherever
we went, even outside the country. It was
hard to take, but I had to accept it since I
didn't want to leave the country. My house
was searched several times, and my notes,
my manuscripts and my mail were confis¬
cated. They even took my typewriters, just
to make things difficult for me.
I don't know why the authorities never
went further than that. Perhaps it was
because my books had been translated
worldwide. After the riots that shook the
country in 1976, the government was
extremely isolated on the world stage. It
had a growing need for aid from the
Western powers, especially the United
Kingdom and the United States. It prob¬
ably didn't want to take direct action
against me. The authorities knew that even
governments as conservative as those of
Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan
would not accept overt repression of South
African intellectuals.
In the late 1970s I began to meet
A.N.C. representatives in various places:
London, Ireland, Australia. That was
another discovery for me, because although
I fully supported the black cause, I still
thought of the A.N.C. as a terrorist orga¬
nization. Making contact with it seemed
almost like treason. I've spent all my life
crossing frontiers, and this was a very dif¬
ficult one to cross. Yet when I did cross it,
I met remarkable people, warm and rich in
experience, people who have taught me
most of the things I know.
During the 1 980s I deliberately set out
to try to explain the policies of the A.N.C.
in my articles and essays. The astonishing
thing was that I was still allowed to publish
these pieces in the newspapers. Some
people within the Establishment must have
been starting to think it was time to take a
look at these problems, to find out about
the A.N.C, the people on the other side.
There wasn't any real understanding yet,
but there was a curiosity, a desire to know.
Perhaps the people who were in power
thought that I was so cut off from the
Afrikaner community that no-one would
be interested in what I said. Then I began
to explain why the A.N.C. espoused vio¬
lence. That led to all kinds of reactions in
the press. A chorus of voices called for me
to be put in prison.
Which members of the AN. C. had the
biggestpersonal influence on you?
I've never met Nelson Mandela, but he
has made a big impression on me from a
distance. Someone who spent a long time
as a prisoner on Robben Island once told
me that Mandela recommended my books
to his fellow-detainees. That was the ulti¬
mate accolade from my point of view.
Obviously, he was one of my heroes.
Among the people who had a big effect
on me were Johnny Makatini, an A.N.C.
representative I met in Paris, Thabo Mbeki,
Barbara Masekela, Kader Asmal, Mac
Maharaj, Essop Pahad, Steve Tswctc. Then
there was the poet Wally Serote to whom
I am indebted for the title of A Dry White
Season. They made a particularly strong
impression on me, personally, culturally
and politically, because each of them had

suffered violence either in prison or in the
guerrilla war, yet they remained very cul¬
tivated people with radiant personalities.
The result of my encounters with them
was my book An Act of Terror, which was
an attempt to explore the act of violenceper
se. Are there situations that can only be
changed through violence? Writing the
book, which took me nearly eight years,
was a journey of initiation for me. At first
I thought I knew what I wanted to say,
but everything changed as I was writing it,
largely because of one of the characters, a
young woman who appeared halfway
through the book and imposed her point of
view on me. She simply wouldn't listen to
what I was trying to explain to her. She
rejected violence completely, and I couldn't
find any easy answer to her arguments.
M For obvious reasons, the black majority
in South Africa has no experience ofgov¬
ernment. Are you afraid that there might
be some anti-democratic backsliding of
the kind that has happened in other coun¬
tries after becoming independent?
No. I'm extremely confident about this.
The A.N.C. has eighty years' history
behind it, an eighty-year tradition of non-
racism. All South Africa's communities
black, white, coloureds are represented in
it. They've had plenty of experience of
political, as well as cultural and educa¬
tional, organization. As far as the future is
concerned, I am reassured by the move¬
ment's experience and its history of toler¬
ance. I know one must be realistic and rec¬
ognize that there is a younger generation of
blacks who have grown up with violence in
the streets and whose first reaction will be
to use violence to solve whatever prob¬
lems may arise. But I also believe that the
extreme violence South Africa has experi¬
enced in the past few years has led more
and more of these young people to under¬
stand and accept the need for dialogue,
reason and compromise.
Andyet the world today seems beset by
separatist, exclusionist tendencies that are
the opposite ofthe democratic integration
you favour.
I think that, particularly in the East
European countries, this tendency for
IZ*^*-* \«?
wf[ l^!\ 7M

fe^üH
countries to split up is a reaction against
enforced assimilation. In South Africa, the
situation is quite different and the reac¬
tion is against enforced segregation. As
things stand today we are at a difficult and
dangerous stage, but I hope it will not be
long before people everywhere understand
the need for interdependence, accepting
not only the differences between peoples
and cultures but also the need to coexist
and find common solutions. That's why
South Africa is a testing-ground. It is a
country with the human potential to
achieve this kind of solution and set an
example for other countries. But there is
also the possibility that everything may
go up in smoke.
Personally, I take heart from the
example of Namibia, which had the same
ethnic mixture and which experienced the
same political and racial tensions. When it
achieved independence, the different fac¬
tions found they could still live together
and that independence wasn't the end of
the world. You must understand too the
deep ties that bind Afrikaners to their land.
They can't conceive of leaving South
Africa. More and more of them arc real¬
izing that the only way to stay where they
are is to come to terms with the black
majority.
Do you believe in the unifying prin¬
ciple of citizenship or in the principle
of difference with guarantees for each
community?
Both are necessary. We need to respect
differences of identity, while also finding
the common denominators that link
everyone so as to promote a South African
identity. Some people have suggested fed¬
eralism, but that risks perpetuating existing
divisions. We need to combine the two
principles.
Last year 1992 was a sombre year
which showed up the divisions within
South African society. But now all the South
African communities are seeking common
ground. I think there's a chance of reaching
a solution that won't necessarily be a
panacea for all ills but that will be a step for¬
ward. It might take the form of a transitional
government	 We'll find a way.
Finally, do you think the changing situ¬
ation in South Africa will affect the style
and subject-matter ofyour writing?
Like every writer of my generation, I
have been deeply marked by apartheid. Of
course that doesn't mean that I needed
apartheid to be able to write! With its dis¬
mantling which threatens to be a long-
drawn-out process because, sadly, apartheid
won't be easily forgotten I'm starting to
feel a new sense of freedom about the sub¬
jects I want to explore. Part of that freedom
may take the form of filling in gaps in our
history, scouting territory that was over¬
looked or forbidden during the years of
apartheid. There won't be any further need
for fiction writers like myself to be overtly
political and to explain the A.N.C.'s policies,
because now the A.N.C. can do that for
itself. So I'll be able to concentrate more
fully on the experiences of individuals,
which have in fact always interested me
more than the political or ideological side of
things. As for my style, I already tried my
hand at writing what one might call an
"entertainment" in 1985, with Adamastor.
In On the Contrary, which will be pub¬
lished in English shortly, I have made my-
first attempt to correct the historical record
and fill in a gap, and I think there's rather
more humour in it than in my earlier writ¬
ings. In forthcoming novels I shall be trying
to get more and more of an imaginative
grasp on reality, to invent history.

EDITORIAL BY BAH6AT ELNADI AND ADEL RIFAAT
The Western world today may be rediscovering something that Asia and
Africa have never lost sight of the importance of gesture and rhythm in
the lives of individuals and communities. Natural, functional and ritual¬
istic gestures, and biological, seasonal and cosmic rhythms may, unbeknown
to us, set the tempo of our relationship with the world around us and with
ourselves. In anthropology and the history of religions, in art, dance and
poetry, these ideas are beginning to regain their long-lost central place.
In the last 200 years, industrial society has asserted the primacy of the
intellect over the body and of reason over intuition. Human beings have
had to adapt to time as measured by the clock rather than to biological time,
to the requirements of machines rather than to those of nature. They
may as a result have acquired an impressive mastery of the material world,
but they have also in many cases become gradually alienated from their
bodies, from their environment and from other people.
It is perhaps because our societies have gone too far in this direction that
we are today witnessing a reaction, in the form of types of individual or
collective behaviour which, however different or even contradictory they
may be, are all rooted in a search for the values of the body and of nature
or in nostalgia for a lost sense of community and for collective ritual
experiences on a grand scale. All these phenomena which include the
vogue for physical exercise and sport, the practice of yoga, zen and med¬
itation, the popularity of dance music with a strong beat, mammoth con¬
certs attended by many thousands of spectators may be seen as signs of
a desire for a less abstract, less disembodied, less individualistic world.
Some commentators think that this trend has an even wider and more
fundamental significance. They see it as a return to something very basic
to human life, and believe that gesture and rhythm may give us a unique
glimpse of certain essential truths, of a primordial wisdom reconciling
nature and culture, the sacred and the profane, the human being and the
universe.
Opinion has long been divided between those who maintain that the
origins of society are of a historical, social and cultural order, and those who
believe in a transcendental, spiritual explanation. This debate is far from
over. We hope to make a useful contribution to it in this issue by giving a
hearing to some original ideas about gesture, rhythm and the sacred.

The new-born baby enjoys an extraordinary moment of union
with its mother* Ail iater spiritual experience may spring from
the memory ofthat primal state
The baby and the saint

is a French child psychoanalyst
working mainly in the field of
autism.
AT the beginning of its life outside the
womb, a baby exists in what I would call
a "state of being". It is its heart, its
breathing; it is merged with its mother. From this
initial state it derives a basic sense of security and
experiences what may be described as a spiritual
condition which enables its mind to live, free from
all thought, feeling and imagination. If, much
later, during its adult life, its balance is threatened,
then it calls on this basic sense of security.
The English paediatrician and psychoanalyst
D.W. Winnicott, who was consulted by more
than 60,000 mothers and babies during his long
career, showed how far the baby "is" its mother
and how vital it is for the baby that its mother is
also it. As a result of "empathy", a kind of
healthy "madness" that the mother experiences
around the third month before the birth and
that continues until several weeks after it, the
mother is under the illusion that she and her
new-born child arc one and the same. The
empathy is expressed physiologically by an.
increase in the level of progesterone in the bodv.
The baby delivers the mother from this condi¬
tion when it passes from a state of absolute
dependence to one of relative dependence.
The state of empathy is so profound that
when a mother loses her baby before the baby
has liberated her from it, she remains a pris¬
oner of it and is only able to mourn her lost
child when another child has taken its place
within her body.

Bonding through looking.
BODY CONTACT
BETWEEN MOTHER AND CHILD
In this state in which the baby is its mother, and vice
versa, they form a single being and at this stage no
thoughts, feelings or images come between them.
"The fundamental relationship . . . , is the mother-
child dyad at the beginning of existence," wrote
he Indian psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar, echoing
Winnicott.
When I think of the child's spiritual dimen¬
sion, I am thinking of this original (or unitary)
state in which it is its mother and, through her, the
entire universe. This is the archaic state that is
rediscovered and transcended by the mystic,
whose asceticism consists of "leading the spirit
into the heart" by prayer. In his book Der Zen-
wcg ("The Way of Zen"), Eugene Herrigcl writes
about the state of "satori" (illumination) as fol¬
lows: "Perhaps this mode of contemplation is
the reconstitution of a form of spontaneous child¬
hood behaviour. In a conversation I once had
with him, the Zen master Taiscn Dcshimaru drew
a parallel between the state of 'satori' and certain
very early childhood experiences in which, he
said, in a state of rapt concentration characterized
by astonishing subjectivity and power, one sees,
one lives, one holds and is held at the same time.
Isn't that how little children play?"
The French psychiatrist and paediatrician
Françoise Dolto believed that "The sophisti¬
cated way of life in Western societies is too
unnatural and leads to brutal disruptions in the
mother-baby dyad, and these disruptions cause
suffering. For it has been impossible for a real
and healthy separation to take place."
Two-thirds of children in industrialized soci¬
eties no longer have a family life. They are social¬
ized in creches or with child-minders from when
they are two months old. The separation brings
suffering and makes it impossible for them to
achieve a healthy social life. The increase in the
number of suicides among young people, drug
addiction and delinquency may to a large extent
be due to these premature separations which
take place before sufficient time has elapsed for
attachment to develop. "This is one of the causes
of psychosis in children today," Françoise Dolto
wrote. "Each child has a genetic capital which
enables it, or not, as the case may be, to endure
separations which have not been prepared for or
mediatized by speech or by rhythmic gestures
such as breast feeding, rocking or carrying."
Breast feeding extends into the world outside
the womb a liquid bond with the inside of the
mother's body, a bond close to that the baby had
with its placenta inside the uterus. Rhythmic
rocking to and fro is a continuation of the move¬
ments that the child experienced before it was
born. As for the baby's pressure against its
mother's body, it reminds the child of the reas¬
suring pressure of the uterus (that perfect con¬
tainer lost at birth), and enables it to rediscover
the rhythms of its mother's breathing and heart¬
beat. This rhythmic continuity ensures "conti¬
nuity of being".

The metrics of the world
Nature is a symphony; everything in it is
cadence and measure: and one might almost
say that God made the world in verse.
VICTOR HUGO
Tos de pierres ( 185 1-1853)
Françoise Dolto believed that early child¬
hood disturbances today are the result of a lack
of the structuring provided by body-to-body
contact with the mother. "In the past, a child
found the rhythm of this pulsatory existence
whenever it wanted to. When it was carried and
breast-fed by its mother, the vibrations of its
mother's voice reached as far as its stomach. If a
mother talks to her baby while breast-feeding it,
the vibrations of her voice are carried by the
warm liquid current which enters the baby and
deposits within its body a linguistic inscription
of love. . . ." Surely this sense of bonding is
being lost today because of disruptions in the
continuity of corporal rhythms.
RHYTHM AND PRAYER
Contemplatives use rhythm to induce bonding.
For some years I worked with a number of Chris¬
tian contemplative communities (Carmelites,
Benedictines, Dominicans, Poor Clares and Fran¬
ciscans) for whom the important moments in
the contemplative life came during the communal
practice of sung prayers. Singing is important
in these orders not so much because of the con¬
tent of the texts as because of the rhythmic
sharing of the chant.
This rhythmic chanting, which requires the
participants to breathe in unison, reminded me
in some ways making allowances for the dif¬
ferent degrees of intensity of the physical com¬
mitment of the zikr (or dhikr), the prayers of
the Sufi mystics of Afghanistan which I have also
witnessed. During these prayer sessions, the
body is shaken by the rhythm and its accelera¬
tion until the person loses consciousness. The
combined rhythm of heartbeats and breathing
banish thought and only the spirit at the centre
of the heart is left. During the ritual dancing of '
the whirling dervishes in Istanbul and Konya the
dancers mime the movement of the planet
through their gyrations and thus identify them¬
selves with the cosmos through rhythm.
In all these ascetic practices, the purpose and
effect of rhythm are to lead the mind back to the
heart and, I think, thus to rediscover an original
state in which one "is", like a new-born baby, the
heart and breathing closest to what Winnicott
called the "true self" which, he wrote, "comes
from the aliveness of the body tissues and the
working of body-functions, including the heart's
action and breathing." The new-born baby
becomes incarnate through the heart and breathing,
whereas the mystic, through a deliberate act of
supreme incarnation, returns to the primal unity.
Psychoanalysts such as Wilfred Bion, D.W.
Winnicott, Marion Milncr and Françoise Dolto
who have explored the origin of the formation of
the psyche are undoubtedly familiar with mystical
states. In their writings we find the "oceanic
spheres" in which the baby finds itself, the per-

mcability of thought and the comprehension of
the newborn baby's state of mind. Perhaps this
primal "occanism", this unitary place, is where
Jungian archetypes arc formed the pre-images
that make possible the emergence of forms and
the birth of the imagination.
All babies boys or girls arc female until
the third month of their growth in utero and the
male sex emerges from the single female sex
after ten to twelve weeks of foetal life. Conse¬
quently, any being is initially feminine. "The
female element," writes Sudhir Kakar, "is that
which establishes the simplest and most fun¬
damental experience, that of being."
As someone who works with mothers and
their babies and with autistic young people, I
wanted to meet the Malangs (Sufi mystics) of
Afghanistan. I felt that an encounter with them
might teach me more about the origins of the for¬
mation of psychism. I thought the Sufi holy men
were akin to the holy men of the Russian
Orthodox church, inhabited continually by the
prayer of the heart. I met a Malang on the great
northern plain on the road to Samarkand, not far
from Kunduz and the border with Uzbekistan. As
he chanted interminably, he rocked backwards
and forwards, seemingly oblivious to the world,
while answering questions about practical and
spiritual matters put to him by villagers, passing
nomads, and even Afghan dignitaries who had
come to consult him for political reasons.
All these mystics seem to be in a state of
oneness in which the difference between I and
thou is transcended and in which one person for
an instant becomes another. This is very similar
to the state shared by the new-born baby and
its mother! It is the Oneness that the ninth-
century Muslim mystic Hallaj expressed in these
words:
Thy image is in my eye
Thy invocation in my mouth
Thy dwelling in my heart
Where then canst Thou be absent?
From these observations which locate the
origin of all spiritual experience in babyhood,
a state whose traces we bear, as if forgotten,
deep within ourselves, we may conclude that
such experience belongs potentially to all, that
it is neither unreal nor magical nor mysterious,
and that it binds us all to each other and to the
universe.
But I should hasten to add that, if human
affairs are to prosper, it would be better not to
confuse the baby's state of being with the
mystic's state of being. The French theologian
Olivier Clement has encapsulated the similarity
and the difference in these words: "Children
sleep as saints pray."

The heartbeat of day

HE soul, before giving itself to the
body, hearkened unto the divine har¬
mony. As a result, after it has entered
the body, whenever it hears the melodies which
best preserve traces of the divine harmony, it
greets them and is reminded of the divine har¬
mony. The soul is drawn towards that harmony,
responds to it and participates in it as far as it is
possible to participate in it."' This quotation
from the Syrian philosopher Iamblichus (c. 250-
c. 330) is an apt starting point from which to
consider the place of religion within the vast
context of the relationship between rhythm and
culture. Earlier, Plato, when discussing poetic
inspiration, had spoken of the "dance of the
soul".' Once the soul becomes incarnate, he
believed, its "dance" is paralleled by a "dance of
the body" based on the natural pulsations on
which religions confer a sacred character.
It is tempting for us in the modern world to
believe that biological rhythms, by tending to
induce calm, regularity or intense excitement,
create a feeling of communion with supernat¬
ural reality, but Iamblichus, a spiritual heir of
Pythagoras and the mystery cults, says precisely
the opposite. In his view, the "dance of the body"
docs no more than reproduce the "dance of the
soul". Body rhythms owe their existence to the
innate presence of an all-pervading energy known
to the Greeks as "harmony".
SAYING IT WITH GESTURES
The words "rhythm" and "harmony" appar¬
ently derive from a common Indo-European
root. The basic idea is that of a correlation of
parts that can produce an organic whole. That is
why the word "rhythm", before taking on in
Plato's time the meaning familiar to us today,
included the notion of "form", of a modifiable
pattern capable of moving from one state to
another, but subject to defined measures and cat¬
egories of movement.-1 Dance immediately comes
to mind, but it is also worth looking at another,
ctymologically related term, the Sanskrit word
rita, which designates a harmonious set of atti¬
tudes or gestures that are meant to maintain or
recreate the order of the world, the primordial
organization of reality intended by the divine.
Close to rita is the word ritu, which means
instant, season, moment of transition. Religions
have always flourished in that area between
]]>

rhythm and rite, between the vibration that
denotes the presence of life and the sacralization
of life through gestures ordained by religion.
In classical China, for example, when a son
performed a scries of formalized little jumps as a
sign of mourning for his father, he was not only
expressing his grief through a cathartic and ges¬
tural rite, but also miming death and transition,
since jumping, with its connotation of disconti¬
nuity, symbolized the point of separation between
two states and two worlds. He actualized sepa¬
ration, representing it in a ceremonial context
which enabled him to come to terms with it and
make it psychologically and socially acceptable.
Another important word is "gesture", which
is found in the Romance languages and comes
from the Latin gcrerc, meaning to act or to accom¬
plish. Religious gestures originate in habitual
acts, in the alternation of night and day, or even
in simpler phenomena such as breathing or the
beating of the heart, but they also have a broader
dimension bound up with myth and the cultural
community. It is possible to detect in French
expressions like chanson de geste and la geste des
Francs a highly specific usage of the word geste
(with a change in gender) whereby the religious
gesture is given the character of a great deed, a
transhistorical model. Without this symboliza-
tion, which distinguishes them from other human
actions, religious gestures would lose their force.
The same is true of the trance, on which
some of the oldest social rituals arc based. The
trance manifests itself clinically by spasmodic
movements that may either be spontaneous or
be brought on by cultural stimuli such as music,
lights, or toxic substances. Generally speaking,
such movements might be interpreted by an
inexperienced observer as pathological mani¬
festations and outlets of unbearable social
pressures, as phenomena accompanying a form
of possession. What makes trance a specifically
religious experience is the fact that it is a bor¬
derline state between life and death, between the
human and the non-human, between wisdom
and madness.
"Rhythm", "gesture" and "trance" all imply
the notion of a transition from a natural condition
whose pace is set by the norms which usually
regulate human life to a "different" situation. Such
a transition can be obtained only if these norms are

Le Yoga, du mythe à la réalité
(Paris, 1991) and C.GJung, la

diverted towards other goals: ecstasy, therapy,
fusion with cosmic forces or communion with a
deity. This transition from natural rhythms to
sacred gestures gives rise to tension between two
poles the pole of a biological existence that has
not yet been given symbolic expression, and the
pole of a life regarded as spiritual because it gives
meaning to the culture as a whole. Human beings
deliberately impose order on the apparently hap¬
hazard nature of cycles that are natural to them:
they regulate their breathing or observe the beating
of their hearts so these can best express "the trace
of divine harmony".4 Biological life thus ceases to
be something profane and insignificant and
becomes a vehicle for the sacred. Most initiation
rites aimed at giving the neophyte a "second birth"
are specifically based on this notion.
BREATHING CONTROL
AND MEDITATION
Breathing is the universal intermediary between
the body and culture. In virtually all traditions it
serves as the prima materia, in the alchemical
sense of the term,11 for prayer, meditation and
chanting. In human beings, it is a reminder of the
primordial energy, which is often imagined as a
breath instilled in them by one or more divine cre¬
ators at the beginning of the world. As it is the
most spontaneous and most necessary of acts, it
carries with it a very wide range of associations,
particularly numerous in some cultures.
One thinks of yoga, which is primarily a
breathing discipline and only secondarily a con¬
certed scries of postural exercises. In yoga, con¬
trol of breathing is not an end in itself but a
means of lulling physiological functions, char¬
acterized by an extreme slowing down of the
respiratory cycle and by prolonged immobility.
Agitation and distraction are states in which the
vegetative mechanisms remain below the level
of consciousness. Calm and concentration, on
the other hand, encourage awareness of breathing
as a gift of life, of the connection between respi¬
ratory rhythm and the emotions, and of the great
value of that function, which is both automatic
and deliberate.
The yogi works on two levels simultane¬
ously the immediate, somatic level, and a more
subtle level of archetypes and representations.
Yoga becomes truly effective when it gives its
practitioners the means to "work their way up"
from reflex pulsations to the subtle systems which
supply them with energy. Breathing, by its con¬
tinuous presence and extreme flexibility, serves as-
a "golden thread" leading from one level to
another.
In another cultural context, the "Jesus prayer",
a remarkable practice of the Eastern Orthodox
Church, also comes to mind. This spiritual exer¬
cise, which was formalized by three major the¬
ologians (St. Niccphorus the Hcsychast,'' Gregory
of Sinai and St. Gregory Palamas) in the thir¬
teenth and fourteenth centuries, is of very ancient
origin. It has something in common with the

Cosmic rhythms
In the primitive and archaic religions . . . the sacred calendar proves to be the "eternal return" of
a limited number of divine gesta. . . . The eternal repetition of paradigmatic gestures and the
eternal recovery of the same mythical time of origin, sanctified by the gods, in no sense implies a
pessimistic vision of life. On the contrary, it is by virtue of this eternal return to the sources of
the sacred and the real that human existence appears to be saved from nothingness and death.
The perspective changes completely when the sense of the religiousness of the cosmos becomes
lost	 The gods are no longer accessible through the cosmic rhythms. The religious meaning of
the repetition of paradigmatic gestures is forgotten. . . . When it is desacralized, cyclic time
becomes terrifying; it is seen as a circle forever turning on itself, repeating itself to infinity.

thinking of the Desert Fathers, who believed
that the invocation of the Saviour against the
forces of evil around or within them was a sov¬
ereign remedy. Down the centuries there has
been a constant reinforcement of the close link
between the force released by utterance of the
Holy Name, the Spirit inherent in it, the state of
meditation sustained by controlled breathing,
and access to a life of perpetual communion with
God. All these themes the motion of the Spirit,
the invocation of the Name, the transition from
energy to meaning in the Word, the attaining of
deconditioned states of consciousness live under
the same symbolic roof, whether it be yoga,
Muslim Sufism or Christian wisdom.
THE HIDDEN WORKINGS
OF THE HEART
Like breathing, the heart-beat has a marked effect
on the tempo of life, and, like it, can within cer¬
tain limits be modified, unintentionally or inten¬
tionally. So in spiritual experience the "heart" is
often seen as the symbolic seat of a divine life
granted to the individual, and the "centre of the
heart" as the innermost recess from which love
and prayer spring forth. Thus the Pscudo-
Symeon, another hesychast master, explains: "As
soon as the spirit has found the place of the heart,
it suddenly sees what it has never seen before. It
sees the air that is within the heart, it sees itself as
completely luminous and full of discernment."
A similar inspiration due perhaps to his¬
torical influences guides the Muslim practice of
dhikr, a continuous recitation of the name of
God based on the rhythm of the heartbeat, which
enjoins the worshipper to "gather" himself into
the centre of his breast and to coordinate the
various phases of breathing with rhythmical invo¬
cation. Superior to the "vocal dhikr" or the "dhikr
with the tongue" is the "internal dhikr" or "dhikr
practised in the heart", for "the heart is the scat of
Faith", "the mine of secrets" and "the source of
enlightenment".7
In the West, such disciplines must have been
practised in medieval monasteries, and were per¬
haps still practised in the sixteenth and seven¬
teenth centuries, to judge from St. Ignatius of
Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. In the calm of the
cloisters, sheltered from the elements, it was cus¬
tomary to practise lectio divina, that is a reading
aloud, or sometimes a murmuring, of the scrip¬
tures. This ritual activity was modelled on the
rhythm of breathing and a regular pattern
imposed by taking several paces in the direction
of each of the four cardinal points. It was less a
"reading with the eyes" than something that
came from the heart, as can be seen from the fact
that the same word was used to denote reading as
such and reciting by heart. At that time the aim
was probably for the whole body to take part in
spiritual life. Putting one foot in front of the
other while communing with nature was in itself
a form of meditation: in this respect St. Francis of
Assisi perhaps had something in common with
Gandhi, the source of whose thinking was a
prayer of the heart encouraged by long silent
peregrinations.
This broader context should also include psy¬
chic life the vibration of the emotions and of the
principal human feeling, love, whose seat is in the
hidden workings of the heart. Diastole and sys¬
tole, like breathing in and breathing out, show life 17

to be the result of two consistently polar move¬
ments that both exclude and attract each other,
creating a complex pulsation that expresses itself
in emotional instability. When humans really
grasp what occurs in that "place of the heart"
they can also feel the heart of the world beating
in it, as one of the Upanishads suggests with
wonderful intuition: "That space within the
heart is as immense as the space without: it is
there that all worlds arc to be found heaven
and earth, fire and wind, sun, stars, moon and
lightning, everything.""
It would seem, then, that the Hindu notion of
a cyclical creation proceeding by successive dila¬
tions and contractions is the macrocosmic exten¬
sion of a physiological reality that has taken on a
symbolic significance.
DAY AND NIGHT
Circadian rhythms also play an important part
in religions, and the hght/darkness polarity in
cultural dynamics. Thus, the Egyptian Pharaoh
is depicted with his legs firmly planted on the
earth and his arms raised skywards, holding
aloft the belly of the starry Night, through
which the sun travels to be born again at dawn.
His body's perfectly vertical posture makes him
the mediator between the earth and the night
sky. The meaning of this archetypal gesture,
represented on many tombs in the Valley of the
Kings, is that it joins the poles to ensure the
birth of a new day. It is easy to understand why
this image should have played such an important
role in funerary art, since it expresses in myth¬
ical language a belief in a certain form of rebirth
and, perhaps, immortality.
Elsewhere, the alternation of day and night
punctuates the various stages of creation. The
best-attested example is that of Genesis in the
Bible, where each "night" marks a further descent
into theprima materia from which the following
da)' will be drawn forth, where each "day" marks
the emergence from primordial chaos, of some
aspect of the real world. Whereas the notion of
concentration, of withdrawal into oneself, is con¬
nected with "night", "day" is a time of creative
expansion and propagation. It is also during the
day that gestures arc performed: "separating",
"calling", "allotting a place", "blessing", "saying",
"shaping", "giving" and so on arc all gestural
models for prophetic action or the working of
miracles. The daytime world is, then, a world of
gesture. It marks time and space, in their specif¬
ically human dimension, with acts that will
become rituals, acts whose ultimate purpose will
be to establish or re-establish a harmony or a
symphonic organization of reality. Just as roots
in the Hebrew language always express an action
and are each given a number, so there is, for each
gesture, an internal rhythm which the term
denoting it brings out to the listener in the form
of meaningful sound vibration.
By going back to the cosmogonies contained
in sacred texts, we can find the underlying ele¬
ments of extremely diverse sets of gestures to
which cultures allot religious functions. Going
into a trance, singing, dancing or playing a musical
instrument arc outward and visible representa¬
tions of a more basic, more comprehensive and
therefore more elusive insight: to create is to
impose a rhythm, or to rediscover, like the poet,
the metric seed of the cosmos.

Marcel Jousse, theorist of gesture
TUE French thinker Marcel Jousse (1886-
1961) was a pupil of the neurologist Pierre
Janet and the noted sociologists Lucien
Lévy-Bruhl and Marcel Mauss. In 1924 he published
Le Style oral rythmique et mnémotechnique chez les
verbo-moteurs,' a work that provided the basis for a
new approach to the study of oral literature.
Born to an illiterate peasant family in the Sarthc,
an area of France in which oral traditions were
still very much alive, Jousse studied Latin, Greek,
Hebrew and Aramaic as a young man. He was
ordained to the priesthood in 1912, and entered the
Jesuit novitiate in the following year.
While lecturing at the School of Anthropology
in Paris from 1932 to 1950, he carried out experi¬
mental research into the origins of gesture and
language, and devised a terminology of his own to
express his concepts.
Joussc's studies, which centred on his belief in
the historical reality ofJesus, focused largely on the
world of the Bible. His "gestural anthropology",
which predated Claude Lévi-Strauss's revolu¬
tionary 1958 work L'Anthropologie structurale
("Structural Anthropology"), was based on three
fundamental laws: rhythmic imitation, formula-
dependence and bilateralism.
Jousse believed that the human mind and body
arc linked, forming a single, composite being, and
that the universe in which the individual exists is a
place of continuous interaction. Taking as his
-
starting point Aristotle's statement that "Man is the
most imitative of creatures; it is through imitation
that he acquires knowledge",2 Jousse elaborated a
comprehensive "mechanism" of rhythmic imita¬
tive gestures copied by human beings from their sur¬
roundings. Of this concept of rhythmic imitation, he
wrote that people are "Naturally imitative, make
themselves a mirror of the real world around them
and echo its interactions. Mimicking gesture, they
seek to express themselves in a spontaneous and
universal language of gesture. When they mimic
sound . . . the oral language they utter is of an ethnic
and particularized nature."1
Jousse went on to discuss the link between cor¬
poral and oral expression, insofar as simple lan¬
guage structures follow the same pattern as the law
of rhythmic imitation. Herein lies the root of
thought. This physical link between thought and
action is the basis of a process of stereotyping of ges¬
tures and abstraction of verbal combinations that
underlies the development of language, mentalities
and cultures. This process is formula-dependence:
"Human gestures, whether conscious or uncon¬
scious, tend to be repeated, and naturally lead to a
form of stereotyping that facilitates expression."4
The premise of Jousse's third law, bilateralism,
is the symmetrical structure of the human body
which, he believed, shapes all forms of human
expression, mental and physical. "And human
beings were to divide up the world as their bilateral
structure dictated," he wrote. "They created a
'right' and a 'left', an 'in front' and a 'behind', an
'above' and a 'below'. With themselves, the people
responsible for the division, in the centre."5
Marcel Jousse's investigations have been influ¬
ential, particularly in the field of cthnolinguistics,
and have opened up new lines of scientific enquiry.
Although overshadowed for a time by the rise of
structuralism in the human sciences, his work is
attracting renewed attention, notably through its
application to anthropology and in education.

the Word, Kuma, is a fundamental force ema¬
nating from the Supreme Being himself Maa
Ngala, creator of all things. It is the instrument of
creation: "That which Maa Ngala says, is!" pro¬
claims the cantor the singing priest of the god
Komo.
Maa Ngala, it is taught, deposited in Maa the
three potentialities of ability, willing and knowing.
But all the forces to which he is the heir lie dumb
within him. They arc static, till speech comes
and sets them into motion. Then, vivified by the
divine Word, they begin to vibrate. At a first
stage they become thoughts, at a second sound,
and at a third words.
In the same way, since speech is the external-
ization of the vibrations of forces, every mani¬
festation of a force in any form whatever is to be
regarded as its speech. That is why everything in
the universe speaks: everything is speech that
has taken on body and shape.
Let me point out, though, that at this level the
terms "speaking" and "listening" refer to realities
far more vast than those we usually attribute to
them. It is said: "The speech of Maa Ngala is
seen, is heard, is smelled, is tasted, is touched." It
¡s a total perception, a knowing in which the
entire being is engaged.
If speech is strength, that is because it creates
a bond of coming-and-going which generates
movement and rhythm and therefore life and
action. This movement to and fro is symbolized
by the weaver's feet going up and down, as we
shall sec later.

Amadou Hampâté Bâ in
Paris in 1981.
HELENE HECKMANN,
o' France, a former staff
member of the French Senate,
is the literary legatee of the
late Amadou Hampâté Bâ and
has charge of his manuscript
archives. Most of the texts
published here have been
extracted from "The Living
Tradition", a study which
appeared in General History of
Africa (vol. I ), published by
Unesco and Heinemann
Educational Books Ltd., 1981.
it is an echo, human speech sets latent forces into
motion. They arc activated and aroused by
speechjust as a man gets up, or turns, at the
sound of his name.
Speech may create peace, as it may destroy it.
It is like fire. One ill-advised word may start a war
just as one blazing twig may touch off a great con¬
flagration. According to a Malian adage: "What
puts a thing into condition [that is, arranges it, dis¬
poses it favourably]? Speech. What damages a
thing? Speech. What keeps a thing as it is?
Speech."
Tradition, then, confers on Kuma, the Word,
not only creative power but a double function of
saving and destroying. That is why speech, speech
above all, is the great active agent in African
magic.
But for spoken words to produce their full
effect they must be chanted rhythmically, because
movement needs rhythm, which is itself based on
the secret of numbers. Speech must reproduce the
to-and-fro that is the essence of rhythm.
In ritual songs and incantatory formulae,
therefore, speech is the materialization of cadence.
And if it is considered as having the power to act
on spirits, that is because its harmony creates
movements, movements which generate forces,
those forces then acting on spirits which them¬
selves arc powers for action.
The weaver and
the blacksmith
In the traditional African society, every artisanal
function was linked with an esoteric knowledge
transmitted from generation to generation and
taking its origin in an initial revelation. The
craftsman's work was sacred because it imitated
the work of Maa Ngala and supplemented his cre¬
ation. Bambara tradition, in fact, teaches that
creation is not yet finished and that Maa Ngala,
in creating our earth, left things there unfinished
so that Maa, his interlocutor, might supplement
or modify them with a view to leading nature
towards its perfection. The craftsman's activity in
operation was supposed to repeat the mystery of
creation. It therefore focused an occult force
which one could not approach without respecting
certain ritual conditions.
That is why traditional craftsmen accompany
their work with ritual chants or sacramental
rhythmic words, and their very gestures are con¬
sidered a language. In fact the gestures of each
craft reproduce in a symbolism proper to each
one the mystery of the primal creation, which, as
I indicated earlier, was bound up with the power
of the Word. It is said: 21

The smith forges the Word,
The weaver weaves it,
The leather-worker curries it smooth.
Let us take the example of the weaver, whose
craft is linked with the symbolism of the cre¬
ative Word deploying itself in time and space.
A man who is a weaver by caste is the repos¬
itory of the secrets of the thirty-three pieces that
arc basic to the loom, each of which has a
meaning. Before starting work, the weaver must
touch each piece of the loom, pronouncing words
or litanies that correspond to the forces of life
embodied in them.
The movement of his feet to and fro as they go
up and down to work the pedals recalls the orig¬
inal rhythm of the creative Word, linked with the
dualism of all things and the law of cycles. His feet
are supposed to speak as follows:
Fonyonko! Fonyonko! dualism! dualism!
When one goes up the other goes down.
There is the death of the king and the coro¬
nation of the prince, the death of the grandfather
and the birth of the grandson. . . .
[In Africa, to say that someone is dead, people
use the expression: "His feet are in agreement",
in other words "they have ceased moving". "For
the wise elders," notes Amadou Hampâté Bâ,2
"life is movement and movement begins with
the contradiction of the limbs	 Non-contra¬
diction means death." The shuttle, the throwing
of which by each hand evokes a need to "let go",
is supposed to say: "Life is a constant toing and
froing, a permanent gift of self".]
The gestures of the weaver as he operates his
loom [like those of the smith or other traditional
craftsmen] are creation in action. His words accom¬
panying his gestures arc the very song of Life.
As for the smith, he is the repository of the
secret of transmutations. He is pre-eminently
the Master of Fire. His origin is mythical and in
Bambara tradition he is called the First Son of the
Earth.
The elements of the smithy are linked to a
sexual symbolism, itself the expression or reflec¬
tion of a cosmic process of creation.
Thus the two round bellows worked by the
smith's assistant are likened to the male's two
testicles. The air they are filled with is the sub¬
stance of life, sent through a kind of tube that rep¬
resents the phallus into the furnace of the forge,
this representing the womb where the trans¬
forming fire works.
The traditional smith may enter the smithy
only after a ritual purifying bath prepared with a
decoction of certain leaves or barks or roots of trees
chosen according to the day. Then the smith garbs
himself in a special way, since he may not penetrate
the forge dressed in just any sort of clothes.
Every morning he purifies the smithy by
means of special fumigations based on plants he
knows of.
These operations over, cleansed of all out¬
side contacts he has had, the smith is in a sacra¬
mental state. He has become pure once again
and is equivalent to the primordial smith. Only
now can he create in imitation of Maa Ngala, by
modifying and fashioning matter.
Before beginning work, he invokes the four
mother elements of creation (earth, water, air,
fire), which are necessarily represented in the
forge: there is always a receptacle filled with
water, fire in the furnace, air sent by the bellows,
and a little pile of earth beside the forge.
During his work, he pronounces special

words as he touches each tool. Taking his anvil,
which symbolizes feminine receptivity, he says:
"I am not Maa Ngala, I am the representative of
Maa Ngala. It is he who creates and not I." Then
he takes some water or an egg and presents it to
the anvil, saying: "Here is your bride-price."
He takes his hammer, which symbolizes the
phallus, and strikes the anvil a few times to sen¬
sitize it. Communication established, he can
begin to work.
The apprentice must not ask questions. He
must only look and blow. This is the mute stage
of apprenticeship. As he advances in knowledge,
he blows in rhythms that are more and more
complex, each one having a meaning. During the
oral stage of apprenticeship, the master will grad¬
ually transmit all his skills to the pupil, training
him and correcting him until he acquires mastery.
Then, after a liberation ceremony, the new smith
may leave his master and set up his own forge. [In
most cases he will previously have made a tour of
the country to work for other great masters from
whom he will have learned not only new tech¬
niques but also new practical or occult skills that
form part of the great initiatory tradition of the
blacksmiths.]
The smith must have knowledge covering a
vast sector of life. With his reputation as an
occultist, his mastery of the secrets of fire and iron

Komo initiation is always a smith. In addition to
all his knowledge of metallurgy, he has a perfect
knowledge of the Sons of the womb of the Earth
(mineralogy) and the secrets of plants and the
bush. He knows what kind of vegetation covers
the earth, where it contains a particular metal, and
he can detect a lode of gold merely by exam¬
ining plants and pebbles.

Word and gesture
The vast category of gestures that accompany
the spoken word is based on a highly specific
relationship between physical movement and
language. People are strongly aware of this,
less In themselves (since gestures are often
made unconsciously) than In others. . . . We
have all noticed how we make gestures while
talking on the telephone, thus proving the
depth of this association, which goes far
beyond a simple speech-function.
The specificity of the relationship also
appears, contrariwise, in the fact that to speak
without gestures can only be the result of a
deliberate and In a more general sense
cultural refusal. Appropriate attitudes mark
this refusal, as when the arms are held at the
sides while certain ritual words are spoken,
and, in societies In which it is not considered
decent for women to make gestures while
they tell stories, the hands are clasped
between the thighs.
Although for most of the time the
gestures of verbal communication are made in
a virtually unconscious manner, the speakers
feel that these gestures possess extremely
specific functions. They accompany the words
and add emphasis to them. They establish or
maintain communication (the speech-
function). In oral narration (both codified oral
literature and stories told spontaneously
during conversation), their function is to
dramatize (in the etymological sense of the
term) and this is highly appreciated by
listeners. Sometimes they replace verbal
expression totally, either because it Is
considered unnecessary because of the
particularly expressive nature of the gesture,
or because it is considered excessive or too
dangerous.
Even more profoundly, one might say that
gesture and speech are truly complementary;
it is as if gestures were felt to be an essential
ingredient of communication which could not
take place without them.

disturbs it must be accompanied by a ritual behav¬
iour designed to save and safeguard its sacred
equilibrium, for everything is connected, every¬
thing echoes everything else, every action agitates
the life-forces and sets up a chain of consequences
the repercussions of which are felt by man.
The craft or the traditional function can be
said to sculpt man's being. The whole difference
between modern education and oral tradition
lies there. What is learned at the Western school,
useful as it may be, is not always lived; whereas
the inherited knowledge of oral tradition is
embodied in the entire being.
The instruments or tools of a craft give mate¬
rial form to the sacred word; the apprentice's
contact with the craft obliges him to live the
word with every gesture he makes.
That is why oral tradition taken as a whole
cannot be summed up as transmission of stories
or of certain kinds of knowledge. It generates
andforms aparticular type ofman. One can say
that there is the smiths' civilization, the weavers'
civilization, the shepherds' civilization, and so on.
Thus the traditional artisan, imitating Maa
Ngala, repeating the primal creation by his ges¬
tures, used to perform, not work, in the purely
economic sense of the word, but a sacred function
that brought the fundamental forces of life into
play and engaged him in his entire being. In the
secrecy of his workshop or his smithy he partook
of the renewed mystery of eternal creation.

AMADOU HAMPATE BA,
Malian writer, historian and philosopher, made an out¬
standing contribution, notably ¡n Unesco (of whose
Executive Board he was a member between 1 962 and
1 970), to win international recognition for African oral
cultures. While he revealed the wealth and values
of these cultures, he also drew attention to their pre¬
cariousness and played an active role in safeguarding
them. His manuscript archives, the "Fonds Amadou
Hampâté Bâ", is the product of half a century's research
into African oral traditions.
He published many books and articles, saving for pos¬
terity some fine examples of Peul oral literature including
Koumen (with Germaine Dieterlen, Mouton, Paris, 1955,
out of print), Kaidara (co-edited with Lilyan Kesteloot,
Belles-Lettres, Collection Classiques Africains, Paris,
1968) and L'éclat de la Grande Etoile (the sequel to Kai¬
dara, same publishers, Paris, 1974). His story L'étrange
destin de Wangrin (The Strange Fate of Wangrin; Presses
de la Cité, Paris, 1973) was awarded the Grand Prix
Littéraire de l'Afrique Noire. His book Vie et enseignement
de Tierno Bokar, le sage de Bandiagara (The Life and
Teaching of Tierno Bokar, the sage of Bandiagara; Seuil,
Paris, 1 980) is a tribute to his spiritual teacher. The first
volume of his memoirs was published in 1991 under the
title Amkoullel l'enfant peul (Actes-Sud publishers, Aries).
Almost half the documents in the manuscript
archives, which cover almost every aspect of the tradi¬
tional lore of Africa south of the Sahara (history, religions,
myths, tales, legends, oral literature, sociology, etc.) have
so far been catalogued and transferred to microfiche.
When this task is completed, full sets of microfiches will
be deposited with the main libraries in France and in
Africa and made available to researchers, in accordance
with the wishes of Amadou Hampâté Bâ. Meanwhile,

BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
Tin; Mediterranean, which lies
between southern Europe,
western Asia and North Africa,
is the world's largest inland sea.
Created by the continental
movements that forced up the Alps,
the Mediterranean basin is one of
our planet's most geologically
unstable areas, subject to earth¬
quakes and flanked by many vol¬
canoes. The waters of the Mediter¬
ranean, fed by the Atlantic through
the Straits of Gibraltar, are renewed
every ninety years. Saltier and
warmer than the ocean, the
Mediterranean is almost tideless.
Of all the world's seas, it has longest
been the scene of human activity.
The great civilizations of Egypt,
Greece and Rome grew up on its
shores.
It has its own characteristic land¬
scapes and vegetation. To the north,
there are red rocks studded with
agaves and prickly pears sur¬
rounding small harbours that shelter
brightly-coloured fishing-boats,
ancient olive groves, umbrella pines
and tall black cypresses, steeply-
sloping islands dotted with spot¬
lessly white villages. To the south
stretch endless sandy beaches where
the Sahara meets the sea. The cli¬
mate is similar to that of California,

offering a quality of life that has
made the region popular with
tourists. The northern shores are
warm in summer and mild and
damp in winter; to the south the
climate is dry and hot.
But the hospitableness of its
coastlands, its rich history arid a
beauty marred only by occasional
storms have not been unmixed
blessings for the Mediterranean.
The cities on its shores have mush¬
roomed, particularly to the south
where there has been a population
explosion. Cairo now has more than
twelve million inhabitants; Alexan¬
dria has five million, Algiers 1 .5 mil¬
lion and Tripoli 1.2 million. In all,
100 million people now live around
the Mediterranean, and the figure is
expected to double by the year 2025.
In addition, 100 million local holi-
daymakers and foreign tourists visit
the area annually, and that figure is
expected to increase to 300 million
over the same period.
This human tide brings with it an
accumulation of refuse that the
Mediterranean countries are unable
to cope with. Further pollution is
caused by the vehicles that bring in
the tourists. There is also pressure
on the area's limited water

resources, since most tourists come
in summer the dry season
reducing the amount available for
local inhabitants. In Israel, Libya
and Malta, intensive water use is
threatening total exhaustion of sup¬
plies. Furthermore, the United
Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) estimates that about 70 per
cent of the two billion cubic metres
of often severely polluted water
from the region's domestic and
industrial outfalls is discharged into
the sea entirely untreated.
A TORRENT OF THREATS
The deluge of industrial and
domestic waste, oil-tanker spillages,
over-building and the tourist flood
mean that the Mediterranean is now
under serious threat. Its inshore
waters are polluted, since, even if
waste water is treated, billions of
bacteria find their way continually
into the sea, threatening bathers
with infection. Its coastline is dis¬
figured in many areas by uncon¬
trolled urban sprawl. The advan¬
tages ofsiting factories on the coast
so that raw materials can be deliv¬
ered by sea have been only too well
understood by industry; there are
now thirty-seven refineries and
tanker terminals, thirty-two indus¬
trial complexes and thirteen nuclear
power stations located on its shores.
Twenty per cent of the world's oil
traffic passes through the Mediter¬
ranean, and the amount of waste
oil flushed into it each year is sev¬
enteen times the size of the Exxon
Valclez oil spill in Alaska in 1989. To
that figure must be added the size¬
able amounts of naturally-occur¬
ring bitumen that ooze into its
waters and the fourteen oil-tanker
accidents that have occurred in the
Mediterranean in the last fifteen
years.
In addition to this substantial pol¬
lution by hydrocarbons, a great deal
ofdamage is being done on shore in
the Mediterranean lands, many of
which were thickly forested within
historical times. Deforestation, car¬
ried out to create farmland, extend
cities or provide fuel or ship¬
building materials, has brought
irreparable erosion in its wake. In
addition to solids brought by rain,
rivers carry down to the sea such
pollutants as detergents, pesticides
and heavy metals like mercury, zinc
or chrome. The Po in Italy, the Ebro
in Spain, the Egyptian Nile, the
Rhône in France, and other rivers
drain off agricultural and industrial
waste, in the case of the Rhône
alone from a catchment area of
94,604 square kilometres and
there are twenty-nine catchment
areas around the Mediterranean!
One direct consequence of this
pollution were the "red tides" which
affected the Italian coastline from
Venice to Ancona in July 1989, cov¬
ering the beaches in a foul-smelling,
glutinous sludge. This phenomenon
is caused by eutrophication (a term
derived from the Greek word
eutrophos, literally "well-fed"), a
process that occurs when decom¬
posing waste matter uses up the
dissolved oxygen in the water, suf¬
focating the local flora and fauna
except for invertebrates, plankton,
bacteria and tiny fungal growths.
The areas most threatened by the
phenomenon include the Golfe du
Lion, the Lake of Tunis, the bay of
Izmir and the Venetian lagoon.

The flora of the Mediterranean
faces many dangers, one of them
being the destruction of the Posi-
donia sea-grass meadows that serve
as the lungs, larder and nursery of
the sea, and where hundreds of
marine species reproduce. Jetties
and marinas encroaching on their
habitat can destroy them, as can
pleasure boats, which tear the
plants up with their anchors.
Recently another danger has
appeared in the form of a "killer"
alga, the almost fluorescent green
Caulerpa taxifolia. Introduced acci¬
dentally off Monaco, it has now
begun to spread on the sea-bed. It is
toxic and has no known predators.
No way of eliminating it has yet
been found, and it has already
spread too widely to be simply
pulled up by hand.
The sea's fauna is equally threat¬
ened. In the course of an expedi¬
tion on the Calypso, Yves Paccalet, a
member of Captain Jacques-Yves
Cousteau's team, noted the gradual
disappearance of the monk seal,
one of the world's twelve most
threatened species. There were
almost 1,000 monk seals in the
Mediterranean in 1980, but their
ranks have been decimated by
hunters and fishermen and only
about eighty are left. The logger¬
head turtle (Caretta carena) now
only lays its eggs on Greek and
Turkish beaches, where they are
often trodden underfoot by tourists.
The turtles often get entangled in
fishing-nets and end up on the
menu in local restaurants. Other
endangered species include the
grouper, the mantis shrimp, the
rough pen shell {Pinna nobilis)
which can grow almost a metre
long, and the date mussel
{Lithophaga lithophaga), which
lives in clefts in the rocks.
A PLAH OF ACTION
To deal with this alarming situation,
an Action Plan for the Mediter¬
ranean has been drawn up on the
initiative and under the auspices of
UNEP, and it was adopted at
Barcelona in 1975. It commits the
eighteen countries bordering on the
Mediterranean, as well as the other
members of the European Eco¬
nomic Community, not only to pro¬
tect the sea from pollution but also
to ensure that coastal development
respects the environment. Ismail
Sabri Abdalla, an Egyptian econo¬
mist, and Serge Antoine of France's
Ministry of the Environment were
commissioned to carry out a fore¬
cast of future developments, and
their work provided the basis for a
"Blue Plan" on future prospects for
the area that was published in 1988
under the direction of Michel
Bâtisse, President of the Blue Plan
Regional Activity Centre and a
former Assistant Director-General
(Science) of Unesco. In 1990 the
Mediterranean Environmental
Technical Assistance Programme
(METAP) was launched jointly by
the EEC, the United Nations Devel¬
opment Programme (UNDP), the
European Investment Bank and the
World Bank. In 1993 it was suc¬
ceeded for a further three years by
METAP II.
Will this be enough? Michel
Bâtisse thinks that oceanographers
have exaggerated the extent of
marine pollution. "The sea is pol¬
luted, certainly, but only near the

perfectly clean. Oil spills disperse
very quickly. It's true that heavy
metals are carried in the atmos¬
phere, that natural mercury wells
up on the seabed in some places
and that sedimentary pollution
needs studying. But it is still not
proven that the fish are poisonous,
even if fishermen are recommended
not to eat them at every meal.
"In my view, the fight against ero¬
sion, the preservation of water
resources, which are too often
wasted, and the protection of the
coastal scenery are the priority
tasks. Rapid population growth on
the southern and eastern shores is
the big problem. Countries have to
support their populations, but how?
They are not self-sufficient in food
production, so they have to import,
and they have neither industrial
products nor services to sell in
exchange. Algeria and Libya export
oil, bu t it's starting to run out. Their
only resource is tourism, but that
depends on the coastline not being
ruined by uncontrolled construc¬
tion driven by the search for quick
profits."

WORM'S TURN
Could the earthworm Eiseinia andreibecome modern
man's best friend? It eats everything from organic waste
to thick cardboard, though not plastic or metals. Its
stomach works like a chemical factory in which bacteria
manufacture enzymes that enrich its excreta. The result
is that the soil it excretes contains twice as much potas¬
sium, three times as much magnesium and five times
as much nitrogen and phosphoric acid as what it
ingests. In other words, it makes a first-rate fertilizer.
This has given rise to the idea that worms could be
reared to regenerate poor soil, a tempting prospect for
Third World countries. French scientists who have been
trying it out in Africa and Peru have found that releasing
worms into the fields has increased harvests by 130
percent!
CITIES OF THE FUTURE
According to the World Bank, two billion people will be
living in Third World conurbations by the end of the cen¬
tury. The figure will rise to an estimated 2.7 billion by the
year 2010 and to 3.5 billion by 2020. Every year, 12tol5
million families flock to the cities. The populations of
many cities in sub-Saharan Africa are doubling or
tripling in the space often to twenty years. Most of the
new city-dwellers will face privation. In 1988, a quarter
of them were living in shanty-towns. To reverse the
trend, development programmes must provide rural
areas with some of the advantages of urban life, such as
opportunities for casual work and access to health care.
ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
IN GRANADA
An information campaign has been
launched over the past school year
in Granada (Spain) to teach pupils
to know and respect their environ¬
ment. Nature trails suitable for dif¬
ferent age-groups have been set up
through the city and its gardens.
Each pupil also receives a comic-
strip leaflet and educational mate¬
rial explaining how to separate out
different kinds of refuse such as
paper, glass and batteries so that
they can be recycled. Further infor¬
mation is available from: Aula de
Educación ambiental, Granada,
Spain (Tel: 22-20-96).
BEAR NECESSITIES
For a male brown bear, lack of
female companionship can be a dif¬
ficult but not a desperate situation.
One bear which had led a bachelor
life for seventeen years in the Aus¬
trian Alps responded so well to
receiving a mate through the good
graces of the Worldwide Fund for
Nature (WWF) that he is now the
head of a family often. His example
shows that there is still hope for the
ten or so bears that remain in the
Pyrenean mountain range on the
Franco-Spanish border as long as
they are not wiped out by hunters
and roadbuilders.

EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS AT RISK
The monuments of Cairo's old city
are being threatened by the rising
ground-water level. When water
penetrates the foundations of a
building, it is sucked up by capillary
action to a height of four or five
metres. The acids in the ground¬
water, which are increasingly con¬
centrated because of leakage from
the city's 100-year-old sewage
system, interact with chemicals in
the masonry and with the oxygen in
the air to form salts which then
attack the walls. According to Said
Zulficar, Deputy Director of Unesco's

water level is partly due to the con¬

the dam was built, the River Nile
received no water during nine

is so high that, in Mr. Zulficar's words,
"you only have to scratch the ground
to reach it." The other problem is
that the sewage system was not built
to cope with the provision of run¬
ning water to the houses of the old
city. It often overflows and is badly in
need of modernization. Meanwhile
the rising water table is threatening
the 400 historic monuments in the

ments as far away as the Temple of

Between October 1990 and February
1991, the United Nations Environ¬
ment Programme (UNEP) and
Canon Inc. held a photographic
competition on the theme "Focus
on Your World". In all, 32,000 entries
were submitted from 144 countries.
A selection of 100 of the photos was
exhibited in Rio de Janeiro during
the Earth Summit in June 1992. To
bring these remarkable images of
the beauties of nature and the
destructive potential ofhumankind
to a wider audience, a book entitled
Your World, which reproduces 214
of the photos, has been published
byHarvill (London, 1992), price $28.

this endangered
species as the
emblem of its
1993 campaign
for the
safeguard of the
environment.
Migros's first
mobile store
(I92S).
oiTUEB Duttweiler had a dream. The son of a Swiss
tradesman, he devoted his career to bypassing
.the middlemen who come between producers
and consumers. In 1925 he bought a fleet of vans
that plied the streets of Zurich selling six basic
commodities coffee, rice, sugar, pasta, cooking oil
and soap 40 per cent cheaper than any other outlets.
He opened his first shop the following year. Mr. Dut¬
tweiler died in 1962, but Migros, the operation he had
begun, continued to expand. By 1990, there were about
550 shops with a total floor area of 900,000 square
metres, a staff of 70,000 and annual sales of 15 billion
Swiss francs.
Migros's growth has not been without its rough
patches, including at one point a suppliers' boycott.
Factories had to be bought or built to permit diversifi¬
cation and to supply consumers as cheaply as pos¬
sible. Quite early on the firm turned into a chain of co¬
operatives owned by its members, who now number
more than one and a half million households.
In 1974, Migros launched M-Sano, a programme
designed to encourage farmers to adopt natural
methods of stock rearing and fruit and vegetable pro¬
duction, using the fewest possible chemical products.
In 1985 environmental protection in various forms was
made a priority goal. Migros started sending products
by rail, saving enough diesel oil a year to send a truck 360
times around the world! It started selling mercury-free
batteries and built the world's first plant for the recycling
and disposal of used batteries. Reusable plastic con¬
tainers have been introduced, taking the place ofsome
60,00 tons of cardboard packaging. Pump-operated
aerosols have replaced those using chlorofluorocar-
bons (CFCs), which are harmful for the ozone layer, as
a propellant. A 50-centime deposit is charged on
biodegradable plastic bottles to encourage recycling.
Coffee, spices, beauty products and detergents are all
sold in refill form, saving customers money and making
more than a thousand tons of packaging redundant.
Tubes of toothpaste are no longer sold in unnecessary
cardboard boxes. Migros's paper cat litter is biodegrad¬
able. Coffee filters are no longer bleached with chlorine.
Yoghurt is sold in polystyrene pots, with a plastic lid
instead ofan aluminium cover. Glass pots were rejected
on the grounds that washing them and replacing those
that were not returned would be more harmful to the
environment than using pots that can be burned along
with other rubbish in central heating systems.
The environmental awareness campaign Migros has
launched, which is aimed both at its own staff and at the
general public, has as its mascot the kingfisher, the.
beautiful blue bird that lives on riverbanks and is now
an endangered species.
Migros is a non-profit-making organization. All its
income is reinvested in retailing as cheaply as possible
healthy basic products that are produced according to
decent standards. In accordance with the wishes of its
founder, Migros sells neither alcohol nor tobacco in
its shops, but retails a vast range of environment-
friendly products.

A Tutsi dancer
(Rwanda).
Meaningful gestures
by Edouard Gasarabwe-Laroche
RWANDANS regard the human body as a
whole. They believe that every gesture
is part of a complex system of expres¬
sion that draws on the resources of language,
memory, tradition, the senses and intuition.
Gestures are always full of meaning, and if
Rwandans often strike rather statuesque atti¬
tudes when they gesticulate they know exactly
what they are doing.
They look on their environment as a land
scape which is alive with forces and symbols.
Against this eloquent backdrop, they repeat again
and again gestures that have remained unchanged
since the time of Gihanga the Inventor, the myth¬
ical figure who is said to have taught them the "cor¬
rect gestures" they should use in daily life, in rit¬
uals and in the practice of trades and crafts.
Gihanga is also thought to have shown them the
"correct shape", a combination of beauty and
efficiency, for drums, tools and weapons. 31

From earliest childhood, the young
Rwandan learns and gradually memorizes "cor¬
rect gestures", taking traditional behaviour as a
model.
Anyone who wants to understand the
meaning of these gestures must know about the
axes and planes of reference that correspond to
the architecture of the human body. Rwandans
believe that the vital centre of the body, situated
deep in the entrails, at the height of the navel, is
the intersection point of three axes: the vertical
axis, the left-right horizontal axis, and the front-
back horizontal axis.
The vertical axis coincides with the axis of the
World. It plunges downwards beneath the
ground, whence lethal forces rise, and reaches
upwards towards Heaven, whence life-giving
forces descend. This is the axis of life and death.
People all over the world have noted that
muscular strength and manual dexterity are
much more highly developed on the right-hand
side of the body than on the left, and modern
anatomical and physiological studies have dis¬
covered and analysed the biological causes of this
phenomenon. The right-left horizontal axis is
that of strength and weakness.
Observation of the gestures used by Rwan¬
dans shows that vision plays a decisive role in the
conception of the front-back horizontal axis.
A belief that evil creatures fear the human gaze
and only attack from behind or under cover of
darkness led to the custom whereby a symbolic
"backward-looking eye" is opened by making
a tonsure at the back of a baby's head.
ROOM TO MOVE
Taken in pairs, these horizontal and vertical
axes define a volume of space in which there are
three planes by reference to which body move¬
ments can be defined.
The vertical and lateral right-left axes
describe the so-called "frontal plane", in which
the body is silhouetted face on and occupies a
large area. On this plane, the only possible
movements arc those to right or left, leaps into
the air, and a lateral rotation of the body around
its "vital centre".
The gestures accomplished in this plane are
of little account in technical or social terms. In
traditional choreography, the participants are
grouped on each side of the principal dancer
familiarly referred to as the "navel" and move
successively to the right and to the left, vio¬
lently stamping the ground and tinkling bells
that are attached to their ankles, as if to crush the
deadly forces lurking underfoot. Reaching
upwards and jumping into the air, they appeal
for the heaven-sent blessings of life, strength, joy
and victory.
The vertical and front-back axes delimit a
plane that divides the body into two symmetrical
parts, a left-hand part and a right-hand part.
This is the median plane, against which the
body's silhouette, projected in profile, occupies
less space. The spinal column never moves out
of this plane. It cannot sway to right or left,
but can only curve forwards or backwards.
Arms and legs may be bent. Feet and hands
may be joined. The dancer can adopt a leaning
position, drop into a crouch or roll into a ball
all attitudes of concentration or protection. He
may also move forwards in the direction of
advance, flight or attack. The median plane is
that in which tools and weapons arc manipu¬
lated, in which individuals come into their own
as active agents.
The front-back and right-left axes define a
transversal plane which divides the body at
navel height and extends parallel to the earth's
surface. Here, the area of projection of the
body's silhouette is very small. The transversal
plane cuts through all the successive frontiers of
the world, which is organized in concentric cir-

cles, with the individual's dwelling-place as the
centre. This is predominantly the plane in which
social relations and communication with nature
take place.
EXPLORING SPACE AND TIME
The body is only alive insofar as it is quickened
by biological rhythms and explores space and
time by means of rhythmic gestures.
For the duration of several moons, attached
to its mother's back, a baby remains in close
physical contact with her and continues to feel
the rhythms with which it became familiar
during its gestation: the music of her respiration,
her heartbeat and her speech, the swaying of
her body as she walks and performs domestic
tasks, the calming language of lullabies.
Later, and indeed at every age, rhythm will
punctuate all the Rwandan's activities, at work
and at play. "Technical" rhythms transform raw
materials into goods or tools, while the rhythms
of song and dance and musical instruments have
a power which is exclusively symbolic. This
rhythmic aura envelops and transfigures
everyday life in Rwanda.

(L'Harmattan, Paris, 1988) and
Kibiribiri L'Oiseau de pluie
(L'Harmattan, 1991).
The vibrant crowd
Rhythm is originally the rhythm of the feet.
Every human being walks, and since he walks
on two legs with which he strikes the ground
in turn and since he only moves if he
continues to do this, whether intentionally or
not, a rhythmic sound ensues. . . .
The knowledge of the animals by which he
was surrounded, which threatened him and
which he hunted, was man's oldest
knowledge. He learnt to know animals by the
rhythm of their movement. The earliest
writing he learnt to read was that of their
tracks; it was a kind of rhythmic notation
imprinted on the soft ground and, as he read
it, he connected it with the sound of its
formation.
.... men, who themselves originally lived
in small hordes, were made aware of the
contrast between their own numbers and the
enormous numbers of some animal herds.
They were always hungry and on the watch
for game; and the more there was of it, the
better for them. But they also wanted to be
more themselves. Man's feeling for his own
increase was always strong and is certainly not
to be understood only as his urge for self-
propagation. Men wanted to be more, then
and there; the large numbers of the herd
which they hunted blended in their feelings
with their own numbers which they wished to
be large, and they expressed this in a specific
state of communal excitement which I shall
call the rhythmic or throbbing crowd.

Hands that speak
volumes
by Savitry Na'ir
34
HAND gestures play a fundamental role
in Indian culture. In ancient times
using one's hands in conversation was
considered a sign of great accomplishment. One
tale describes how a king met a beautiful girl and
fell in love with her. Wanting to know whether
she was free to marry him, he interrogated her
by lifting up a closed fist with the thumb
raised the traditional gesture for "man" in
sign language. When she replied by opening
her hand, he knew the gesture meant there was
no man in her life, and that she was unattached.
The word for hand gesture in Sanskrit is
mudra, a term that also has several other mean¬
ings. It can be used to signify a seal or a signet
ring, and by extension can also denote an
impression, a stamped coin, a token or printer's
type. The link between the first sense and the
others is that mudra arc regarded as seals
between the three constituent parts of the human
personality spirit, mind and speech. Mudra
illustrate the link between the internal and
external life of man, as well as the parallels
between the human and the divine worlds. (In
Indian thought the human world is considered
a replica of its divine counterpart, and the human
body is the visible form of the divine.)
The analogy between the two worlds, human
and divine, which are constantly in communica¬
tion through different elements of which mudras
arc one, is fundamental to Indian thought. The
unseen principle of divinity can only be
approached through symbol and allegory. The
interaction between the physical and the meta¬
physical lies at the roots of Indian philosophy.
In Hindu thinking, all life is one and every
element is significant. This unity is stressed in
religion, the arts and social life. Different ways
of life, systems of philosophy, forms of artistic
expression and ways of worshipping the innu-

mcrablc avatars of the Divine all have the same
goal: a coherent, all-inclusive and ever-evolving
knowledge of the Divine. Such knowledge can
only come through individual experience, and
each seeker must find his or her own path.
God is worshipped in the form of innumer¬
able divinities, the form of worship varying
according to the characteristics of each one.
According to the Bhagavad Gita, "Man
becomes what he worships", and "Whenever a
devotee wishes, with unwavering faith, to wor¬
ship Me in a particular form, I take that form".
When worship takes the form of a ritual or a
prayer the chanting of a text or secret for¬
mula mudra serve to "seal" the power con¬
tained within the words and actions to the image
of the divinity who is being worshipped.
THE LORD OF THE DANCE
There is a close relationship between gesture
and sound. When they accompany specially
chosen mantras sacred verbal formulae or
nadas musical sounds repeated in a pre¬
scribed manner, the appropriate mudras can set
the body and the mind in a state of vibration. In
this context, mudras possess magical proper¬
ties that may be put to esoteric use, and become
a secret gestural language known only to initi¬
ates. Buddhist priests took mudras of this kind
over the land route to Nepal, Tibet, China and
Japan and by sea to Indonesia, Cambodia and
other lands. In those Asian countries where
Buddhism took root, mudras influenced the
iconography of the arts, and in particular sculp¬
ture, founding a tradition which remains alive to
this day.
For a ritual to succeed, the accompanying
mudras had to be correctly performed, so par¬
ticipants took care to execute them with preci¬
sion. This principle of exact imitation was car¬
ried over to the arts, and became a crucial factor
in Indian dance, sculpture and iconography.
Sculptures were inspired by dance poses, while
in return dancers borrowed gestures and atti¬
tudes liberally from the visual arts. Even now,
the ways in which the gods arc depicted in
Indian dance reflect their treatment in temple
sculpture.
This is particularly true of Siva Nataraja,
the Lord of the Dance, who is represented with
four arms. One hand holds a drum, symbol¬
izing creation; another fire, representing destruc¬
tion; a third is upturned, a sign of reassurance;
and the fourth is open and pointing down, to
indicate protection. In contemporary choreo¬
graphy, the god is often represented with other
of his attributes, among them a deer, a trident, a
skull, a third eye, a crescent moon or the River
Ganges. He may be shown with a decoration of
snakes, with sacred ash on his forehead, with a

dwarf demon underfoot or else riding on a bull.
Mudras suggesting any of these attributes can,
depending on their context, be references to
Nataraja.
In Hindu thought dance was created by
God, but was codified and transmitted to
humans by a sage called Bharata, author of the
Natya Sastra, a treatise which dates from
between the years 3 B.C. and 5 A.D. This text
has remained ever since the principal sourcebook
for all the dramatic arts. A wide range of move¬
ments for each part of the human body is enu¬
merated and explained in the book. Later texts
further expanded the list, creating a vast reper¬
tory oí mudras that remains the basis of all the
different styles of dance practised to this day.
There arc currently seven classical styles of
dance, as well as innumerable semi-classical and
popular ones. Each developed in a different
region, and reflects local particularities. They are,
respectively, Bharata Natyam, from Tamil Nadu;
Kathakali, from Kerala; Mohini Attain, also

Signs and signals
A gesture is any action that sends a visual signal to an onlooker. To become a gesture,
an act has to be seen by someone else and has to communicate some piece of
information to them. It can do this either because the gesturer deliberately sets out
to send a signal as when he waves his hand or it can do it only incidentally as
when he sneezes. The hand-wave is a Primary Gesture, because it has no other
existence or function. It is a piece of communication from start to finish. The sneeze,
by contrast, is a secondary, or Incidental Gesture. Its primary function is mechanical
and is concerned with the sneezer's personal breathing problem. In its secondary
role, however, it cannot help but transmit a message to his companions, warning
them that he may have caught a cold.
Most people tend to limit their use of the term "gesture" to the primary
form the hand-wave type but this misses an important point. What matters
with gesturing is not what signals we think we are sending out, but what signals are
being received. The observers of our acts will make no distinction between our
intentional Primary Gestures and our unintentional, incidental ones. In some ways,
our Incidental Gestures are the more illuminating of the two, if only for the very
fact that we do not think of them as gestures, and therefore do not censor and
manipulate them so strictly.

from Kerala; Kuchipudi, from Andhra Pradesh;
Odissi, from Orissa; Kathak, from northern
India; and Manipuri, from Manipur.
Each of these styles has two distinct ele¬
ments, one purely rhythmic and the other nar¬
rative or expressive. In dance sequences of the
first type, mudras are simply decorative, com¬
plementing the dancer's movements. The feet
mark the beat, and for each step there is a cor¬
responding gesture. The accompaniment is
instrumental and rhythmic.
Narrative sequences accompany mystical
poems or texts sung by the musician, and here
the mudras serve to illustrate the lyrics. The
dancer's agile hands may evoke birdflight, rivers
flowing down mountainsides, confrontations
of gods and demons, seasons changing, lovers
coming together or separating. In such cases, the
performer has the opportunity to demonstrate
her capacity as an actor or storyteller, miming
with vivid gestures and expression all the dif¬
ferent characters in the stories, which are often
drawn from the great Hindu epics, the Ramayana
or Mahabharata, or else from hymns, myths or
legends.
Though grace of expression, beauty of move¬
ment and dynamic power are all evident in
Indian dance, they are not the heart of the matter.
The essence of the art lies in its vivid perception
of the religious meaning of life.
IMAGES EVOKED BY GESTURE
It is impossible to understand narrative dance
without acquiring familiarity with the language
of mudras from a recognized master, who serves
as the representative of the oral tradition. It is up
to the master to choose a disciple who will in her
turn assure the continuity of that tradition. The
master becomes a second parent to the pupil,
who in return is expected to show absolute
fidelity to the tradition as well as complete obe¬
dience to the teacher. This student-teacher rela¬
tionship is basic to the transmission of the tra¬
ditions of Indian dance.
Once a dancer has mastered the technique,
her fingers become veritable antennae with
which to communicate with the spectators.
Through gesture alone, without the aid of either
decor or accessories, she can call up vivid images,
portraying in turn, say, a dangerous animal, a
pretty girl with big eyes, an exotic garden and the
playing of musical instruments. But to make
the evocations come alive, each mudra must be
accompanied by the right facial expressions.
The eyes arc particularly important, for:
Where the hand goes, the eye must go,
Where the eyes go, the mind goes,
Where the mind, there the expression,
Where there is expression, there is joy.
The mudras used in dance arc divided into
two categories: single- and double-handed ges¬
tures. There are twenty-eight of the former,
ranging from patakd, "the flag", for which forty-
two different uses arc listed, to chandrakala,
"the crescent moon", with only two listed uses.
Pataka is described as follows: "When the hand
is open, with the fingers straight and the thumb

folded at the side, this gesture is called pataka by
the people conversant with dance gestures. With
the flag mudra we can designate forty-two
images. Some of these are: me, you, everyone,
night, river, moonlight, a horse, grace, entering
a street, ocean, forest, to sweep. . . ."
In combining mudras in the course of a nar¬
rative performance, a dancer may first interpret
a phrase of the text literally, and then, when the
singer repeats it, use her imagination to elaborate
the theme. Take a typical refrain such as "What
has happened to your heart? it seems as heavy
as stone". The first time the words arc sung,
the performer will simply illustrate the words
"heart", "heavy" and "stone". When the words
arc repeated, however, she may choose to elab¬
orate the story, showing how gentle and loving
the hero once was, and how his heart was poi¬
soned by another woman. In this example, the
surface meaning of the story is obvious enough.
The dancer's skill will lie in bringing out its
hidden, symbolic significance, which involves
humankind's mystic yearning for the divine.
It is the focus on divinity that gives Indian
dance its unique harmony, which is achieved
through discipline and concentration. Symbols
arc vehicles that carry one along a spiritual
journey that began thousands of years ago and
still continues as India's dancers trace fleeting
gestures mudras with untiring hands.

Testing times
by Abdeiha'i Diouri
In Morocco,
competition
between the
rhythms of
traditional ana
modern life is
blurring people's
sense of time and
distance
THE idea of rhythm relates to music, to
poetry and to biology, but in all these
fields mere regular repetition is not
enough to produce rhythm: it simply divides
time into identical units. Rhythm comes into
being when a variation characterized by the
recurrence of a constant feature at regular inter¬
vals arises within this group of units. By differ¬
entiation, alternation, symmetry, emphasis,
changes of pace and other figures, this varia¬
tion arouses an emotion, imparts a meaning, or
induces people to do something.
In latc-twcnticth-century Morocco life is
lived at two rhythms which are out of phase
with each other: an old rhythm rooted in tradi¬
tion, and a new Westernized rhythm which
stems from Morocco's recent history. The two
are experienced simultaneously, in an apparent
confusion which deserves to be clarified.
Even today, traditional craftsmen wake up
for the dawn prayer and at once start their
working day, which is itself punctuated by
prayers. Work stops for a frugal meal at the
midday prayer, and is interrupted again between
the mid-afternoon prayer and the sunset prayer,
a time when craftsmen set about selling their
products, stocking up with raw materials and
doing the family shopping. After the evening
prayer everybody goes home for the evening
meal (this schedule changes during the month of
Ramadan).
OLD
AND NEW WAYS
The religious component, which is crucial to
the workings of the guilds, also plays an ethical
role in craftsmen's lives, by strengthening their
sense of integrity. Given the mechanism of

checks and balances, operated mainly by the
peer group, and the competitive pressure of life
in the guilds, these craftsmen make it a point of
honour to produce high-quality work, even
using rudimentary tools. They feel personally
involved in their work and their dignity is at
stake. Their lives are governed by the rhythm of
their own bodies, and their finished products
bear the stamp of their energy and enthusiasm.
If you watch a coppersmith at work in Fez,
or a slipper-maker, or a tanner, you will sec that
manual strength is needed but strength allied
with dexterity. Mastery is a matter of technique:
working hours call for an ascetic's reverential
concentration and a certain meditative tension
a far cry from the mere use of mechanical energy
to turn out products.
Some time is also set aside for festivities, time
spent in another, livelier world. People go off on
pilgrimages lasting several days. They may visit
a holy shrine, where they make sacrifices, cat,
dance and play. They exchange gossip and word¬
play, devote themselves to pleasures and com¬
merce of various kinds, and then disperse. The
timing of these festivities is determined by the reli¬
gious calendar and the cycle of the seasons (which
draws on ancient astrological and mythological
beliefs), and also by public events.
Access to modernity results not in what
Roland Barthes called "the tame alternation of
work and rest" but in various uneven types of
rhythm so uneven, indeed, that those who
experience them often think they are victims
of an enforced, dubious and perhaps even
abortive form of change.
All the features of modernity exist in
Morocco today: electricity, industrialization,
electronics, the media, computerization, high¬
speed transport and communications, and big
cities (but not research, particularly basic
research). The so-called modern sector of pro¬
duction is in a ceaseless ferment of activity. As
well as the traditional craftsmen and small busi¬
nessmen, a mass of workers has come into being,
together with factory managers, company direc¬
tors and trade unions. Alongside the traditional
power structure, the Makhzen, a government, a
set of representative bodies and a tentacular
civil service have been set up.
Social life is now governed by a quite dif¬
ferent rhythm. With electric lighting people
stay up later, but they get up much later too.
They work two half-days, and measure time
by the clock rather than by prayers. At their
workplaces they have become familiar with the

working to strict timetables and performing
endlessly repeated movements. Their powers
of endurance arc put to the test. They have dis¬
covered the dullness and monotony of admin¬
istrative tasks. They travel by car or public
transport, which means that they use space in a
new way and that much more time is bound
up with work. Instead of the narrow alley-ways
of the medinas, they use wide roads, and hear
motor horns and traffic noise instead of the
sound of footsteps.
On leaving work people stop off at a café or
bar for the "happy hour" (when they can get
two drinks for the price of one) before going
home, keyed up by the noise of the streets, which
gets worse and worse each year. Back at home,
they watch television, read the paper or talk on the
telephone. They have weekends off and a month's
annual holiday, and arc paid by the month. They
wonder how on earth previous generations man¬
aged to survive without today's technological
amenities, but the fact is that the pace of modern
life, dazzling though it may be, is relentless. Many
people, disappointed by modernity, have decided
to return to the past, without feeling that they arc
yielding to a nostalgic illusion.
A COMPOSITE SOCIETY
In practice, however, the modern rhythm and
the traditional rhythm succeed and interpene¬
trate each other. The transition from one to the
other, made up of the many adjustments char¬
acteristic of what the sociologist Paul Pascon has
called "composite societies", follows circuitous
paths and produces unusual situations.
Unpunctuality, the accumulation of garbage
in cities and sloppy work are three symptoms of
this crisis of modernity.
Unintentional lateness time apparently out¬
side the employee's control is especially
revealing. A person was "caught by the clock", or
there was a last-minute hitch, or he missed the train
or the bus. The car wouldn't start. The lights
stayed red too long. Often people don't even
bother to give an excuse. Lateness reflects a real dif¬
ficulty in mastering modern time. Instead of trying
to save it ("time is money"), people spend time lav¬

a sign of the decline in the old organization of
public services. The ubiquitous presence of
refuse seems to be an evil inherent in modernity.
But perhaps the most unequivocal sign of the
profound insecurity caused by the sudden loss of
the old personalized relationships (with other
members of society, and with space and time) is
sloppy workmanship, which also reflects a strong
resistance to the depersonalizing anonymity of the
factory. The insidious advance of automation
breeds a feeling in those with the old craftsman's
mentality which comes close to resentment. Work
ceases to be regarded as a leading factor in defining
a person's identity, something that possesses a
value associated with dignity and love and is prac¬
tised with humility as is still the case among
craftsmen, despite their narrow profit margins. It
is not yet an end in itself, as it is in the modern
system. It engenders a kind of shame, rancour
even, which may have a paralyzing effect.
How will the crisis of relationships with time
and space, which afflicts so many societies, be
resolved? At what rhythm ought we to live? H

include Fridays. In addition to the many school
holidays which prolong the parents' month of
summer vacation, there arc days off for the official
events associated with public holidays. All these
holidays, a new feature of Moroccan life, combine
with religious festivities and extra days between a
public holiday and a weekend to paralyze pro¬
duction as during the month of Ramadan.
The reason for this poor timekeeping, which
has become a symbol of underdevelopment, is
that old habits still persist from the days when time
was measured in a rough and ready fashion (for
prayers), and the home and the workplace were
not far away. People are still far from accustomed
to commuting evaluating distances and the time
needed to travel them and despite electricity
they still maintain the habit of closing early, going
home early and keeping themselves to themselves.
Piles of garbage in front of houses, espe¬
cially in the streets of the old medinas now
abandoned by the urban elite, have become a
typical feature of the urban scene. This too is a
structural relic of the traditional emphasis on life
at home behind closed doors plus, of course, 41

SAVIMG CAMBODIA'S DANCE
TRADITION
Em Theay, Head Teacher of Cambodia's
National Dance Company in Phnom
Penh, is one of the last surviving
keepers of Cambodia's sacred dance
traditions. These traditions, which she
preserved during three and a half years
of forced labour in the countryside
between 1975 and 1979, may die out
unless they are properly recorded. She
and her pupil Sok Chea are the main
characters in The Tenth Dancer, a
documentary by the Australian film¬
maker Sally Ingleton which shows the
preparation for the Buong Suong, a
sacred dance traditionally performed in
Cambodia at the New Year. The film
was made with assistance from
Unesco's International Fund for the
Promotion of Culture and other
international bodies.
FAMILY PHOTOS
A total of 1 32 prizes were awarded in a
photo contest on the theme of the
family, organized by UNESCO and the
Asian Cultural Centre for Unesco
(ACCU), when the jury met in Tokyo in
April. The prize-winning photos were
selected from among 9, 1 1 7 entries from
133 countries. The three Grand Prix
went to: Chen Anding (China) for Blood
Relation (Prize of the Director-General
of Unesco); Knud Nielsen (Denmark)
for Football (Prize of the President of
ACCU); and Miguel Cruz (Dominican
Republic) for Hope (Prize of the World
Decade for Cultural Development).
Each of the three will receive $5,000
and a Nikon F4 AF camera at a
presentation ceremony to be held at
Unesco Headquarters in November.
MAN AND THE BIOSPHERE
Two new volumes have been issued in
English in Unesco's "Man and the
Biosphere" series. The first. Decision
support systems for the management of
grazing lands, describes applications of
the software known as "decision
support systems" (DSS), containing
databases, ecological system simulators
and economic analysis programmes, and
shows how this software can be used in
technologically less advanced countries.
The second volume, The world's
savannas Economic driving forces,
ecological constraints and policy options for
sustainable land use, examines the
economic, ecological and political forces
affecting tropical savannas and makes
policy suggestions for the future. The
two volumes are available by mail order
from Unesco Publications, Sales
Division, 7 Place de Fontenoy, 75352
Paris 07 SP, France. The price of 380
French francs per volume includes
postage by surface mail.
'AN INDIA CALLED AMERICA*
"In what way did the Encounter of Two
Worlds contribute to transforming my
culture or that of my people?" This was
the theme of an international literary
contest organized by UNESCO in
connection with the five-hundredth
anniversary (1492-1992) of the
Encounter of Two Worlds and co-
sponsored by the municipal authorities
of Saint-Malo (France) and the French
association Etonnants Voyageurs. Over
1 50 works were submitted from some
40 countries. On 20 May a jury of
internationally-known writers awarded
the first prize, worth $10,000, to a 42-
year-old Portuguese writer, José Jorge
Letria, for his essay Uma India chamada
América ("An India called America"). A
second prize, worth $3,000, went to
Andre Neumann from Germany, and
five other prizes went to writers from
Colombia, Gambia, France, Ecuador and
Mexico.
WOMEN AND SOCIETY
Four short documentary films on the
theme of women and development
show by means of authentic case-
studies how Latin American peasant
women have acquired knowledge and
skills relevant to their environment and
taken economic and commercial
initiatives. The films, lasting five minutes
each, were co-produced by Unesco, the
United Nations Development Fund for
Women (UNIFEM) and the Secretariat
of the Convenio Andrés Bello (SECAB).
They are available from Alejandro

A NETWORK OF LIBRARIES
To counter the dearth of books and
periodicals imposed by lack of funds on
university libraries in the developing
countries, Unesco's International
Institute for Educational Planning (HEP)
has begun to establish a network of
depository libraries and documentation
centres in those countries. The HEP is
targeting those resource centres
particularly concerned with educational
planning; more than a hundred have
already been selected. It is hoped that
200 depository libraries will be in place
by 1995, with the largest concentration
in Africa, followed by Asia, Latin
America and the Arab States.

HUMAN RIGHTS ARE
UNIVERSAL
HUMAN rights have established themselves as the eth¬
ical foundation of an emergent world civilization. I
should like to underline the role played by the United
Nations system in this process, from its initiation to current
efforts to promote preventive measures of all kinds.
Yet so much more remains for all of us to do. The recent
relaxation of ideological tensions within the world commu¬
nity aroused great expectations for the wider observance of
human rights. However, the hatreds and brutal conflicts that have
erupted in many parts of the world, particularly in the aftermath
of the Cold War, have underscored how deep the roots of intol¬
erance are. The recrudescence of racism and xenophobia and
massive violations of human rights based on ethnic and cultural
difference give a particular urgency to the continuing task of
combating intolerance and promoting respect for fundamental
human rights.
Article 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
stipulates that "Everyone is entitled to a social and interna¬
tional order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this
Declaration can be fully realized". While we do not know the
answer to the question "What weight of poverty can the wings
of freedom bear?", we know the question to be most perti¬
nent. Human rights and freedoms are indivisible, and indi¬
vidual freedom flourishes more readily where the servitudes of
poverty and ignorance have been abolished. By the same token,
respect for human rights and dignity is an essential leaven of
authentic development.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Education is one of the most powerful means available to us for
promoting human rights. It is the firmest foundation for a
human rights culture, rooted both in attitudes and values and in
specific knowledge. UNESCO has already carried out a wide
range of activities in this field, namely: the preparation of study
programmes, textbooks and teaching aids; the training of edu¬
cators, journalists and professional groups interested in human
rights; dissemination of the corresponding information through
the Associated Schools Project; implementation of the Rec¬
ommendation concerning Education for International Under¬
standing, Co-operation and Peace and Education relating to
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; the award every two
years of the UNESCO Prize for the Teaching of Human Rights;
and more recently, the establishment of UNESCO chairs on
human rights education. The ultimate aim is to establish a new
and wide-ranging system for teaching these rights, extending
from the earliest stages of education to university level, not
forgetting non-formal education and catering for the whole
population, especially children, minorities and the disabled,
whose rights are still all too frequently left out of account and
require greater protection.
The end of the Cold War has afforded fresh opportunities
for broadening the scope of human rights education by adding
to it the essential dimension of democracy. Democracy is the
only context in which human rights can be exercised and
respected. Education for democracy is predicated on the
premise that, although there cannot be one single model for
democracy, there is a set of universally recognized values and
principles without which true democracy cannot be built.
AN ETHICAL TRUTH
In the matter of the protection and observance of human
rights, wc have a practical task to perform. We must secure
more effective and more universal support for the international
instruments adopted in this field by the United Nations, the
International Labour Organisation, UNESCO and other insti¬
tutions.
This practical, effective universality, which we are striving
to achieve, will be merely the reflection and corollary of that
other universality, which underpins it. I am talking about
moral universality: in other words that of the values enshrined
in that landmark text whose forty-fifth anniversary we celebrate
this year. The universality of human rights: this says so much,
and yet so little. Arc we truly aware of the ethical truth
expressed in this one phrase? That each and every human
being has the same rights? Do we truly understand that each
individual is both a unique being and the epitome of the
species? Do we recognize in our way of life and behaviour the
implications of the fact that human rights form part of the
common heritage of humanity?
These rights arc common to us all because they belong to
each person. There is no group or country that can claim to be
the sole custodian of a universal heritage. They are universal
because they transcend cultural differences. It may, of course,
be objected that they cannot be applied uniformly to all cul¬
tures, but it cannot be denied that the values in whose name
these rights arc invoked correspond to aspirations inherent in
human nature and are therefore well and truly universal.
Human rights arc also universal because, although each person
is unique, there is but one human species.
At the dawn of the third millennium, the concept of human
rights interactive, inseparable and indivisible belongs in a
context that encompasses economic, social and cultural rights,
civil and political rights, the right to a wholesome environment,
the right to human and sustainable development, and even
the rights of future generations. We should welcome this con¬
tinuing process of expansion.
These rights have a collective dimension in the sense that
they may be claimed by individuals if the individual is a
member of a group. In this connection, now more than ever
before, since this year we are celebrating the International
Year of the World's Indigenous People, the voice of those
people must be able to be heard, to be heeded, and to be part
of a democratic polyphony in which all the components
respect one another.

In the aftermath of the First World War
there was a widely-felt need for a supra¬
national institution that would put an end
to war, that endemic sickness ofhuman
societies.
The League ofNations was founded
in Geneva in 1920, and in the following
year its member states agreed that there
was a need for international intellectual
co-operation.
The idea won support, and on 4
January 1922 an International
Committee on Intellectual Co-operation
was created. A consultative body that
held an annual meeting lasting a week,
the Committee consisted of twelve
members elected on the grounds of their
' intellectual stature. Among these
distinguished thinkers were two physicists,
Marie Curie and Hendrik A. Lorentz; an
astronomer, George £ Hale; a
philosopher, Henri Bergson who v/as
the Committee's first president; and a
classical scholar, Gilbert Murray. In 1 924
Albert Einstein and the Argentine poet
Leopoldo Lugones joined the Committee.
The extent of the tasks facing the
Committee soon revealed its
inadequacies, and in due course it was
suggested that a permanent body should
be created. The French government
offered to host this organization and to
provide it with a budget In this way the
International Institute of Intellectual Co¬
operation, Unesco's forbear, came into
being. The Institute was inaugurated on
1 6 January 1926, with headquarters in
the Palais-Royal in Paris.
Between 1931 and 1939, the
Institute was extremely active, and a
distinguished body of thinkers took part
in its work. A Permanent Committee on
Arts and letters, whose president was
Paul Valéry, issued a number of
publications, including a periodical,
Correspondance; a series of booklets
known as "Cahiers"; and the verbatim
record ofa series of "conversations"
which in many cases are still as relevant
today as when they took place.
In 1 938, to extend the range of
activities that had until then been carried
out under the auspices ofa single state, a
diplomatic conference attended by
representatives of forty-five countries met
in Paris and set forth an "International
act concerning intellectual co-operation".
However the war prevented this plan
from being put into effect
R
Paul Valéry
A League of Minds1
Thefundamental aim ofthe League
of Nations appears to be to bring
about a state of mutual under¬
standing between the nations so that they
may no longer have recourse to the brutal
expedients and violent and short-lived
settlements of disputes with which they
have hitherto been content. The League is
therefore based on a belief in humanity
and on a certain faith in man's intelligence.
This belief and this faith are of the same
nature as the belief and faith which are
essential to any scientific research and to
any disinterested effort.
If that is true and if it is agreed that an
increase in understanding and knowledge
are the necessary conditions for the
achievement of the League's aims, co¬
operation between minds specially con¬
cerned with things ofthe mind (as we may
term intellectuals) is of all forms of inter¬
national co-operation the most impor¬
tant to encourage; and the particular
organs of that co-operation should be
made a subject ofspecial study and should
be strengthened and improved as experi¬
ence suggests.
	 Ifwe compare the results achieved
with the essential aim set forth above
that is to say, the creation of a state of
mind which will bring about and support
a League of Minds if it is agreed that a
League of Minds is a sine qua non for a
League ofNations and that each must rest
on one and the same foundation, namely
public opinion, and that neither can exist
unless its value is generally recognized;
and if lastly it is realized that the whole
problem of their existence consists in
making them needed and desired by every
thinking being in arousing an emotional
reaction to their existence then our work
of co-operation and the work of the Insti¬
tute, which in themselves are admirable
and may be of great utility, must be
regarded as a response to demands that
have not yet been made and as sustenance
offered to those who do not yet feel the
need for it.
	 The Committee onArts and Letters
is therefore of the opinion that, for a suffi¬
ciently prolonged period, the principal aim
of intellectual co-operation in general and
of the Institute in particular, should be to
convince the intellectual world that orga¬
nized co-operation is possible, that it is a
matter of individual and personal concern
to every intellectual and that each should
make it a habit to consult and utilize the
organs ofthat co-operation	
	 Unless the work of intellectual co¬
operation is dominated and inspired by
regard for the highest things of the mind,
it will never be understood by those for
whom it is intended and will not have the
slightest influence on education, produc¬
tion, public opinion and hence on the
mind of modern man whose co-opera¬
tion is so desirable and essential for the
League of Nations.

Paul Valéry and Henri Focillon
Reaching the general conscience2
It thus appears that the Permanent
Committee on Arts and Letters may
be envisaged in two ways, that it has,
in a sense, a twofold purpose; its activity is
technical insofar as it seeks to establish
and organize relations, where none exist
and where the need makes itself felt,
between the literary and artistic institu¬
tions of different countries, but it must be
more general too; it seems difficult to prove
to the intellectual world that it is directly
concerned in the work of the League of
Nations if it is not given the opportunity to
discuss the problems which most pro¬
foundly affect intellectuals themselves; if
a way of bringing them together is not
found, in conditions that have yet to be
defined, to carry out real intellectual work,
to compare their ideas and make them
known through the publication of book¬
lets; if the research they are asked to carry
out is solely concerned with formal and
procedural matters and not with the sub¬
stance of problems	
The nature of the League of Nations is
to respond to an emergency. In our case
the emergency is the life of the mind. Let
us not pretend to ignore that it is threat¬
ened, directly by anxiety about the future
and the instability of political life, indi¬
rectly by the industrial system and the
crisis through which it is passing. Perhaps
it is possible to glimpse the future of intel¬
lectual life as taking place in select and
closed circles, privileged retreats, in con¬
ditions of solitude that will to some extent
guarantee its freedom. But the mind is
only fully itself if it is not lateral, if it is
involved in the world even if this may
be hazardous, if it tends towards a form of
leadership that is not muted and debated
but dazzling and accepted.
The French writer Paul Valéry
in 1937.
Every great age has consciously and
clearly set forth its definition of man, not
as a sum of fortunate and unfortunate
experiences, not as a collection of contin¬
gencies, but as a kind of ¡deal portrait set
up as an example and capable of inspiring
resemblance. History is thus a gallery of
half-authentic, half-painted portraits
which are all the more authentic because
they have been so influential. In this art in
reverse, the portrait is the model, and living
people are the copies. It is thus possible for
us to imagine ourselves, to the extent of
their respective efficiency, as Renaissance
man, the educated man of the seventeenth
century, the eighteenth-century philoso¬
pher, and several other exemplary types
closer to us in time. Some people will think
that the definition of man appropriate to
this historical period should be formu¬
lated by poets or philosophers who can
think it out and derive it from the facts. But
we see from the past that these vigorous
sketches are not the product of solitary
dreaming but are due to the collabora¬
tion, conscious or otherwise, of a large
number. Thus the French Encyclopaedists,
at a moment in European life when man,
transcending frontiers, was perhaps at his
most self-possessed since the pax Romana,
combined far less to compose a useful
repertory of the knowledge of their time
than to produce a certain doctrine and to
revise the definition that classical genius
had long given of itself.
No group at the present time could
reasonably claim to undertake such a task.
But men of goodwill certainly have the
right and possibly the resources to estab¬
lish consultations which could be useful,
after drawing up a kind of emergency list.
The essential question is that of educa¬
tion. Pedagogical programmes and
methods only concern us indirectly, but
the problem of the goal, from which all
others proceed, presents itself to us on all
sides. What do we wish man to be? On
what type do we wish him to be modelled?
What are the ministries of public instruc¬
tion aiming towards, in all the countries of
the world? 	
We also see that Europe has extended
to the universe, that it has made contact
with profoundly original and solid forms
of thought and life. To what extent is this
collaboration between races leading to a
revision of the old humanism? Can we dis¬
cern the outline of a new humanism in
which man in his diversity will find unan¬
imous reasons for thinking and acting? In
a world apparently governed by the spirit
of quantity is it possible to maintain the
spirit of quality? Is this a purely verbal
antinomy or is it a distinction of a more
decisive kind? And is this distinction
reducible or will it continue to bring into

confrontation élites based on divergent
mystiques?
To all these problems the aims of
education, the new forms of humanism,
quantity and quality others may be
added, which also preoccupy the intellec¬
tual world, which directly and individually
interest its representatives and which they
feel the need to discuss among themselves.
It will be for the Committee to choose and
formulate them.
All these problems stem from the
activity and the competence of special¬
ists. But these general concerns which are
connected to the higher life of humanity,
which are its very conscience, should first
be evoked by men of mature reflection
before being considered in discussions
which they will organize, and being con¬
sidered from a technical point ofview. By
following this method we have an oppor¬
tunity to extend to a singular degree the
audience of intellectual co-operation and
reach the general conscience.

Central Asia-from earliest
times to the present
Bukhara and Samarkand, the Khyber Pass
and the Pamir mountains, Sinkiang and
the Gobi desert, the Amu Darya and the
Syr Darya these evocative place-names
bring to the mind's eye the vast geo¬
graphical and cultural region in the heart
ofAsia that has long been a source of fas¬
cination for people in other parts of the
world, especially in the West. Many works
of ancient and modern literature testify
to the influence and achievements of cen¬
tral Asian civilizations. The Cimmerians
appear in Homer's Odyssey, and the Greek
historian Herodotus described the way of
life of the Scythians in the fifth century
B.C. Since then travellers and writers from
Marco Polo to Rudyard Kipling and Dino
Buzzati {The Tartar Steppe) have portrayed
this region where fantasy and reality are
never far apart, and poets such as Hâfiz
and Omar Khayyam have brought it to life
in verses of lyrical splendour.
Our knowledge ofcentral Asia has been
extended by the recent publication of two
important books, one a detailed work of
historical scholarship that is nevertheless
accessible to the general reader, the other
specifically aimed at a very wide audience.
Both books share the merit of shedding
light on the region's major contribution
to the history of civilizations.
The historical work is the outcome of a
far-reaching project to study the civiliza¬
tions of central Asia that was launched at
Unesco's nineteenth General Conference,
held in Nairobi in 1976. It is the first
volume in what will be a six-part Histoiy of
Civlizations ofCentralAsia that will study
the peoples ofcentral Asia from the earliest
times to the present day through archae¬
ology, history, language and spiritual life.

central Asia to the Middle East and the
Caucasus. It draws attention to the com¬
plexity of the situations today facing many
ancient ethnic communities welded
together by language, customs, religion
and history. Its authors have devoted par¬
ticular attention to the lesser-known peo¬
ples, those of Iranian, Turkish or Caucasian
origin.
Little-hnown treasures
The first volume of the Unesco series is
subtitled "The dawn of civilization: ear¬
liest times to 700 B.C." and takes us from
palaeolithic times to the Iron Age. What are
the frontiers of central Asia? As defined in
the Unesco History, they encompass the
ancient civilizations ofAfghanistan, north¬
eastern Iran, Pakistan, northern India,
Mongolia, western China and the central
Asian republics of the former U.S.S.R.
These pages bring to our attention many
little-known ancient objects and remains:
the superb neolithic sites ofKashmir, finely
crafted ornaments discovered in Mon¬
golia, exquisite bronzes from Iran and
Afghanistan, and extraordinary female fig¬
urines dating from the fourth millennium
that have been unearthed near the
Caspian Sea. The volume also explains the
origin of the Indo-Iranian languages and
their irresistible journey westwards in the
course of thousands of years, as well as
the subtle phonetic changes which led to
the development of certain languages
spoken in Europe.
What strikes the reader most during this
extraordinary journey from the earliest
Stone Age vestiges through Scythian crafts¬
manship in precious metals to the remark¬
able accomplishments of urban planning
in the Indus valley civilization is the pres¬
ence of a spiritual dimension which is
common to the peoples ofcentral Asia and
transcends their extraordinary diversity of
expression. Attracted both by conquest
and by sedentarization, these pastoral and
nomadic peoples, who tamed the horse as
an instrument of conquest but also dis¬
covered the benefits of agriculture, all
shared the same admiration for authen¬
ticity and beauty. The study of archaeo¬
logical remains proves that the cultural
interactions of these peoples and those of
China, the Fertile Crescent and eastern
Europe go back to very ancient times.

Edwards' warm, classic style,
honed by years of experience.
ANTONIO HART.

Aaron Grave (piano), Greg
Hutchinson (drums), Darren
Barrett (trumpet), Gary
Bartz (alto sax), Jamal
Haynes (trombone), Kimati
Dinizulu (percussion)
CD BMG NovusOI24l 2
This is a first-rate offering
from the talented young
saxophonist Antonio Hart, a
former pupil of Jimmy Heath
who has been playing the
international festival circuit
in company with trumpeter
Roy Hargrove. All the sidemen
with the exception of Gary
Bartz are youngsters; Jamal
Haynes, for example, is only
nineteen. This accomplished,
sensitive, intelligent music
reveals the extraordinary
maturity of Hart's work.
BUSTER WILLIAMS TRIO.
Tokudo
Buster Williams (bass),
Kenny Barron (piano), Ben
Riley (drums)
CD Denon 8549
This reissue of a disc
originally recorded in Japan
in 1978 shows the three
musicians working together
in an atmosphere of complete
mutual understanding. It
features two Buster Williams
originals alongside standards
that include "Someday My
Prince Will Come", played
with the same bass obligato
as on later versions recorded
by Williams and Barron.
Williams proves himself to be
a master of the sliding note,
and like Ray Brown, the
model for a whole generation
of bass-players, he has a big,
majestic tone, letting the
notes resonate on the strings
without cutting them off.
Kenny Barron displays his
customary elegance.

MUSIC FRON
AROUND THE
WORLD
SICILY.
Music for the Holy Week
Anthology of Traditional
Music
CD UNESCO/Audivis D82I0
Few lands have a richer
folklore than Sicily, where
many different civilizations
have left their mark. This disc
is a collection of polyphonic
chants for male voices, sung
in dialect or in dog-Latin, and
of mixed-voice choral music
and brass-band pieces, some
influenced by tunes from
opera. The chants, which
employ the technique known
as faux-bourdon, draw their
inspiration from Christian
liturgy and also from very old
pagan traditions, and in some
cases reveal the influence of
Arab music. This fine
recording should win wider
recognition for Sicilian
popular culture which, like
Neapolitan theatre, is among
the most remarkable in Italy.
MYRDHIN
ANDPOLHUELLOU.
Harp and Bamboo
CD Excalibur 841
The harpist Myrdhin and
the flautist Pol Huellou
employ a variety of bamboo
instruments including
shakuhachi and bansuri
flutes and a whistle to play
Celtic or Celtic-influenced
melodies such as "The Trees
They Grow So High", "I

True Love Tonight" and "The
Banks of Sullane". Although
the wind instruments are not
themselves Celtic, they
nonetheless succeed in
capturing the dreamlike
atmosphere of the moors of
Ireland, Scotland and
Brittany. The recording
reveals the vitality of an
ancient civilization whose
artistic and musical wealth is
only now being rediscovered.
CÔTE D'IVOIRE.
A Senufo-Fodonon Funerary
Vigil
Anthology of Traditional
Musics.
CD UNESCO/Audivis D8203
Funerary vigils are
important ceremonies among
several West African peoples
including the Dogon and the
Senufo, just as they are for
many of America's black
communities. They provide
an occasion for music and
dancing that can go on for
several days and nights. The
Senufo-Fodonon, who arc
well-known for their
sculptures as well as their
musicianship, celebrate them
with the aid of so-called
bolonyen, ensembles of one-
stringed, bow-shaped harps
and gourd-rattles. The
symbolism of the songs the
musicians sing as they play is
explained in the booklet that
comes with this compact
disc. The beat is regular, and
the music swings to rhythms
that recall Afro-Latin or
Caribbean music. Their
t e o o y

vigorous rituals serve as a
reminder that in Africa the
dead, promoted to the status
of ancestors, are never cut off
from the living.
ANTENOR BOGEA.
Samba em Paris
CDOBA 144
Antcnor Bogéa is cultural
attaché at the Brazilian
Embassy in Paris, but by
vocation he is a singer. He has
just brought out this
attractive first record, on
which he is accompanied by
French and Brazilian
musicians and sings in
Portuguese, French and
English. A self-confessed
romantic, Bogéa pays tribute
to Paris in the title song,
which evokes different parts
of the city. But his main
subject is love, especially in
the melancholy "Chant de
l'Aube" ("Dawn Song"): "In
the disorder of your heart/My
blood got lost, found the
wrong vein	" Bogéa is a
new voice and one that is
bound to have an impact on
Brazilian music. He already
has the seal of Chico
Buarque's approval.

Recorded many times before,

contrasts with the harshness
of the String Trio, one of
Schoenberg's later
dodecaphonic works.

The Huelgas Ensemble,
which specializes in

performs several religious
pieces by the little-known
composer Michael Praetorius
(c.1571-1621), who studied
philosophy and theology at
Frankfurt an der Oder and
was influenced by the music
of Orlando di Lasso. Both
voices and instruments (viola
da gambas, sackbuts,
recorders, cornet, chorist
bassoon) are superb, and the
recording is of a high
technical quality.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
THE SCIENCE
OF ECOLOGY
Interviewed in your April 1993 issue ("A
time to love. . ."), Luc Ferry served up a
hotchpotch of historical facts, lines of
thought, political trends and purely per¬
sonal interpretations which may be con¬
fusing for an uninformed reader.
He seems not to understand the sci¬
entific meaning of the word "ecology".
Ecology is not about the supremacy of
some over others but about a balance of
ecosystems, ofwhich man forms part.
' Today this balance is threatened.
Urgent measures are called for, but some
people refuse to accept this.
B. Beys
Brussels (Belgium)
LIVING
IN THE PRESENT
I agree with some of the points made by
Luc Ferry, and especially with his view that
environmental movements should remain
democratic. But in general I feel that he
goes too far, notably when he compares
Romanticism with Fascism.
Above all I find that he, like all those
who think about the meaning of human
life, has an attitude that seems to me dan¬
gerous and ultimately suicidal. Under the
pretext that he is a thinking creature, man
feels obliged to give a meaning to life,
instead of simply being content to exist,
like animals. We chase will o' the wisps, we
do not live!
Luc Ferry, like so many people in the
Western world before him, seems not to
realize that many peoples could not care
less whether or not life has an abstract
meaning. I feel extremely dubious about all
the so-called "values" of the West, even if
they improve conditions and provide solu¬
tions here and there. I even think that they
are negative and ultimately suicidal. I shall
always be hostile to those who behave as
if they are the owners and managers of
the entire planet, greedy predators who
spread ruin and death.
Our future lies on mother earth and
nowhere else. Life has no particular
meaning except that we should live for
the moment, enjoy each day as best we
can, and love, fully, gently and at every
second, all creatures and things on earth.

FAIR EXCHANGE
As a reader of the Thai edition of the
Unesco Courier, I very much appreciate
the dialogue between cultures which you
present in each issue. This is a heartening
and necessary task in the world today.

FULL MARKS
Throughout my career as a geography
teacher who in the last few years has spe¬
cialized in environmental education, I
have found the Unesco Courier to be an
extremely useful teaching aid. It is a mine
of information and a powerful stimulus
to reflection about cultural issues.
I should like to emphasize four aspects
of the magazine which I think are particu¬
larly useful: the diversity of the viewpoints
expressed in it, so that each month's theme
is examined with exemplary open-mind-
edness; the commentary by Unesco's
Director-General, a wide-ranging and stim¬
ulating analysis; the interviews, which owe
their interest to the choice of the interview¬
ees and the relevance of the questions; and
the range of information and shrewd
analysis of the Greenwatch section. Con¬
gratulations!
