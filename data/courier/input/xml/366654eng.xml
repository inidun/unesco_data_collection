CourierT H E  U N E S CO
“We want to write an encyclopaedia 
on our water issues. Could you help 
us?” It was with this request that a 
delegation representing the Mayangna 
community from the Bosawas rainforest 
in Nicaragua, visited UNESCO in the mid-
2000s. Also known as the Heart of the 
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, their 
forest joined UNESCO's World Network 
of Biosphere Reserves in 1997. In 2002, 
the Organization had launched the Local 
and Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
(LINKS) programme, and it was the 
right time to start an innovative project: 
registering the holders of indigenous 
knowledge, in order to publish all the 
know-how that the Mayangna had 
on fish and turtles. A book of over 
450 pages, in two volumes and in two 
languages  (Mayangna and Spanish) 
was published in 2010, marking the 
completion of the first stage of a larger 
project on Mayangna knowledge about 
nature in general. 
The Mayangna knew that if they did not 
urgently document their knowledge in a 
book, it would gradually disappear – just 
as their forest was disappearing under 
the pressure of the illegal logging of 
trees and the development of intensive 
agriculture. These two methods of 
exploiting nature are in contrast to the 
traditional way of life of the indigenous 
peoples of the Bosawas Biosphere 
Reserve – based on hunting, fishing, fruit 
and vegetable harvesting, and breeding 
livestock, all of which are self-sustaining.
UNESCO has helped the Mayangna to 
safeguard their knowledge, so that they 
could pass it on to future generations, 
but also to make it available to the 
international scientific community. 
This is one of the main functions of 
LINKS, which aims, in particular, to 
ensure an equitable role for indigenous 
knowledge in formal and informal 
education and to integrate it into 
scientific debates and policies.
This knowledge, which contains 
essential information on the subsistence, 
health and sustainable use of natural 
resources, is conveyed and transmitted 
by only one means – language. This is 
why the safeguarding of indigenous 
languages – a growing number of which 
are now threatened – is crucial not 
only for the maintenance of linguistic 
diversity, but also for the world's cultural 
and biological diversity.
While indigenous peoples make up 
only 5% of the world's population, they 
speak the majority of its 7,000 languages 
and “own, occupy or use resources on 
some 22% of the global land area, which 
in turn harbours 80% of the world’s 
biological diversity”, according to the 
book Weathering Uncertainty, published 
by UNESCO in 2012.
With the designation of 2019 as the 
International Year of Indigenous 
Languages  (IYIL2019), officially 
launched at UNESCO on 28 January, the 
international community reaffirms its 
commitment to supporting indigenous 
peoples in their efforts to preserve 
their knowledge and enjoy their rights. 
Since the adoption of the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by 
the United Nations General Assembly 
on 13 September 2007, considerable 
progress has been made in this regard.
Nevertheless, indigenous peoples still 
have a long way to go before they 
emerge from marginalization and 
overcome the many obstacles they 
face. One-third of the world’s people 
living in extreme poverty belong to 
indigenous communities, just as in a 
number of countries, legislation that 
promotes the rights of indigenous 
peoples remains incompatible with 
other laws that deal with issues such as 
agriculture, land, conservation, forestry, 
mining and other industries, according 
to Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples.
The Wide Angle section in this issue 
of the Courier is dedicated to these 
indigenous peoples. It takes its title from 
the Chinese proverb: “When you drink 
water, think of the source”, to remind us 
that indigenous knowledge, the source 
of all knowledge, deserve a prominent 
place in modernity. The issue also marks 
the celebration of International Mother 
Language Day, 21 February.

When you drink water,
think of the source
Portrait of Zinda, from the Walé 
2eme Regard series, 2015, by French 
photographer Patrick Willocq. Zinda is 
a walé (primiparous nursing mother) 
who, according to the tradition of the 
Ekondas (Democratic Republic of the 
Congo), must live in solitary confinement 
after the child's birth. The walé take 
on a nickname (Zinda is nicknamed 
“the drowning one”) and engage in an 
elaborate beautification ritual to draw 
attention to themselves.

Grave threats 
The biggest threat comes from climate 
change, which is gravely impacting 
their subsistence economies. So-called 
development projects such as dams, 
plantations, mines and other extractive 
activities are also taking their toll, as 
are government policies that minimize 
diversity and encourage homogeneity. 
There is an increasing propensity of 
states to criminalize any dissent, resulting 
in more and more rights violations. 
We have witnessed an unprecedented 
rise in the number of indigenous peoples 
harassed, arrested, imprisoned, and even 
summarily executed for daring to defend 
their territories. 
What is often overlooked in discussions 
on these concerns is the impact of 
these threats on indigenous cultures 
and values. Indigenous peoples derive 
their identities, values and knowledge 
systems from their interaction with 
their territories, whether forests or seas. 
Their languages are shaped by their 
environment – it is their attempts to 
describe their surroundings that forms 
the bases of their unique tongues. Thus, 
when the territory is altered, changes also 
occur in the culture and eventually, in the 
language.
The Inuit, for example, have more than 
fifty terms for snow, each appropriately 
describing different types of snow, in 
different situations. Snow is a prime 
element that the Inuit live with, and 
therefore have come to know intimately. 
The same is true with the Igorot of 
the Cordillera in the Philippines when 
describing rice – from when it is but a 
seed ready for planting to when it is fully 
ripe and ready for harvesting, to when it is 
newly cooked and ready to be eaten and 
when it takes the form of wine.
Minnie Degawan
For indigenous peoples, 
languages not only identify 
their origin or membership in a 
community, they also carry the 
ethical values of their ancestors 
– the indigenous knowledge 
systems that make them one 
with the land and are crucial to 
their survival and to the hopes 
and aspirations of their youth. 
Indigenous languages:
Knowledge
and hope
While new information and 
communication technologies could 
be used to enhance the learning 
process and provide tools to preserve 
indigenous languages, this is sadly not 
the case. Because indigenous peoples are 
considered minorities, their languages 
are often overlooked in positive efforts 
by governments to protect languages. 
For instance, in the Philippines, the 
government has launched the use of 
mother tongues in schools, but no 
resources are available in terms of 
teachers and learning materials to allow 
for indigenous children to be taught in 
their mother tongues. As a result, they 
end up mastering another language and 
eventually losing their own. 
Notions and values lost 
In addition, because of years of 
discrimination, many indigenous parents 
choose to teach and talk to their children 
in the dominant languages – in order 
to create optimal conditions for their 
social success. Since their mother tongue 
is often used only by older people, an 
entire generation of indigenous children 
can no longer communicate with 
their grandparents. 
In my community, the Kankanaey 
Igorot, we have the concept of inayan, 
which basically prescribes the proper 
behaviour in various circumstances. 
It encapsulates the relationship of the 
individual to the community and to the 
ancestors. It goes beyond simply saying 
“be good”; it carries the admonition that 
“the spirits/ancestors will not approve”. 
Because many of the young people now 
no longer speak the local language and 
use English or the national language 
instead, this notion and value is being 
lost. The lack of dialogue between elders 
and the youth is exacting a toll, not just 
in terms of language but in ancestral 
ethical principles.
The state of indigenous languages today 
mirrors the situation of indigenous 
peoples. In many parts of the world, 
they are on the verge of extinction. The 
biggest factor contributing to their loss 
is state policy. Some governments have 
embarked on campaigns to extinguish 
indigenous languages by criminalizing 
their use – as was the case in the 
Americas, in the early days of colonialism. 
Some countries continue to deny the 
existence of indigenous peoples in their 
territories – indigenous languages are 
referred to as dialects, and accorded less 
importance than national languages, 
contributing to their eventual loss.
But today, the major influence on the 
sorry state of their languages is the fact 
that indigenous peoples are threatened 
themselves.

Keeping languages alive
However, with the growing global 
recognition of indigenous knowledge 
systems, the hope that indigenous 
languages will thrive and spread in 
spoken and written forms is being 
rekindled. Many indigenous communities 
have already instituted their own systems 
of revitalizing their languages. The Ainu 
of Japan have set up a learning system 
where the elders teach the language to 
their youth. Schools of Living Tradition in 
different indigenous communities in the 
Philippines similarly keep their cultural 
forms, including languages, alive.
This edition of the Courier is a welcome 
contribution to the worldwide effort to 
focus more on indigenous languages. It 
is a valuable companion to the UNESCO-
Cambridge University Press book, 
Indigenous 
knowledge and 
climate change 
Indigenous knowledge provides 
a valuable resource on traditional 
ways of observing global climate 
change and on adaptation 
measures that various peoples have 
invented over time. How can this 
knowledge be used in the debates 
about the climate threats we are 
currently facing? 
This is the question at the heart of 
the book, Indigenous Knowledge 
for Climate Change Assessment and 
Adaptation, co-published by UNESCO 
and Cambridge University Press 
in 2018. It underlines the need for 
dialogue between climatologists 
and traditional knowledge holders 
for a better understanding of our 
environment in order to achieve 
sustainable development.
Based on research papers and expert 
reports, the book provides a global 
overview on the subject – starting 
with seasonal environmental practices 
in Melanesia and climate knowledge 
in Micronesia, the north-western 
Amazon and Chiapas in Mexico. 
It explores how indigenous peoples 
are coping with climate change in 
Blue Mud Bay in Australia, eastern 
Papua New Guinea, south-west 
China, the Bolivian Andes and 
coastal Kenya.
The book provides testimonies on 
how indigenous peoples in the 
southwestern United States and on 
the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua 
cope with extreme weather events. 
It includes accounts from pastoralists 
– from the Arctic to the semi-desert 
lands of south-west Ethiopia and 
South Sudan. 
Also discussed are the effects of 
climate change and the resilience of 
the indigenous people of the Small 
Island nations, the peasants of the 
Amazonian Andes, the Iñupiat of 
Alaska and the Sámi in northern 
Sweden (p. 26). 
This transdisciplinary publication is 
the result of collaboration between 
UNESCO’s Local and Indigenous 
Knowledge Systems (LINKS) 
programme, the United Nations 
University’s Traditional Knowledge 
Initiative and the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
Indigenous Knowledge for Climate Change 
Assessment and Adaptation, published in 
2018. The book illustrates the importance 
of indigenous knowledge in addressing 
contemporary global challenges. 
A Kankanaey Igorot from the Cordillera 
in the Philippines, Minnie Degawan is 
Director of the Indigenous and Traditional 
Peoples Program at Conservation

She has years of experience advocating 
for the greater recognition and respect 
of indigenous peoples’ rights, and has 
participated in various policy-making

Ndejama cuia chi ini zaza
Mexico’s Mixtec people know how to speak 
the language of nature 
To determine the right time to plant 
maize, the farmers rely on the juniper 
tree. If they see that the leaves are 
beginning to turn to dust, it means that 
the rainy season will be late, and that, if 
necessary, they should delay planting 
until mid-June, or even later.
In fact, in recent decades, the rainy 
season – which usually lasts from May 
to August in the Mixteca Baja region 
– has become increasingly late. And 
farmers can often be heard saying, 
“ndejama cuia chi ini zaza.”
The greatest 
threat to 
the survival 
of indigenous 
peoples 
comes from 
climate 
change
Ndejama means “change”, while cuia has 
many meanings – the expression can 
be used to designate the changes of 
the month, the year, or the season. The 
phrase ini zaza designates one of the 
four types of heat (ini) distinguished in 
the Mixtec language: lo´o (mild), keva 
kandeinio (bearable), kini (great), zaza 
(unbearable). The frequency with which 
we now hear of ini zaza – which used to 
be an exceptional phenomenon – has 
been increasing. That is why farmers 
now associate this phrase with climate 
change. What scientists today define 
as “climate variability”, the Mixtec have 
always called ndejama cuia.
The Mixtec have been in tune with 
nature for centuries. Today, as in olden 
times, they interpret the signs that 
nature sends them to make the right 
decisions. Their language contains 
a great variety of information that 
could provide solutions to the current 
problems raised by climate change. 
In 2019, UNESCO’s LINKS programme 
on Local and Indigenous Knowledge 
Systems will publish a glossary of 
Mixtec expressions and terms related to 
climate phenomena in the Mixteca Baja 
region, to facilitate discussions between 
experts and the holders of traditional 
knowledge.
Aracely Torres Morales,  
Mexican linguist of Mixtec origin 
The Mixtec of Mexico have long known 
how to predict changes in the weather 
from the behaviour of birds and plants. 
When they hear the first grave and sad 
notes of the chicucu bird, for example, 
they know that it heralds the end of 
the rainy season. As long as the chicucu 
sings, farmers know that the dry season 
will be prolonged, and that the time 
has not yet come to plant their beans 
and pumpkins.

Interview by Saturnin Gómez 
Manon Barbeau, it has been said, holds the camera in her heart the 
way others hold it in their hands. For the last fifteen years, she has 
invested all her enthusiasm and know-how in Wapikoni, a project 
that provides young people in indigenous communities with mobile 
audiovisual production tools. More than a thousand documentaries 
have been produced as a result, giving visibility to these stigmatized 
communities. But the achievements of Wapikoni go far beyond the 
cinema – and beyond Canada.
Manon Barbeau:
A camera
in her heart
How did you come up with the idea 
of meeting the indigenous peoples 
of Canada?
It goes back to my youth. I think I 
inherited my father’s interest in images, 
and my mother’s spirit of activism. My 
father was a painter and one of the 
sixteen signatories of the Refus Global 
(total refusal) Manifesto in 1948, that 
opposed the influence of the clergy in 
Quebec and advocated a free society. 
My parents have separated. My mother 
left for the United States, where she was 
involved in the civil rights movement for 
black Americans.
Years later, I became interested in what 
had become of the children of that 
generation, and directed the film Les 
enfants de Refus global (The children 
of total refusal). That experience made 
me realize how art, and especially 
cinema, has a transformative power. 
When you get involved in a film the way 
I did, you’re not the same person at the 
beginning and at the end of the shoot.
I wanted to share this feeling of 
transformation with those who 
undoubtedly need it most – the 
marginalized. I gave a voice to street 
youth and to prisoners, by holding 
up a mirror to them – that, instead of 
reflecting an image of prejudice and fear, 
allowed them to see beyond.
Then, in the early 2000s, I went to 
meet the most marginalized of the 
marginalized – Canada’s indigenous 
communities.
Could you tell us about your first 
experience with them?
I decided to write the screenplay for 
a film, La fin du mépris (The end of 
contempt), with fifteen young Atikamek 
people from Wemotaci, a reservation 
located between Manawan and 
Obedjiwan, in Haute-Mauricie, Quebec. 
I admired their talent and, at the same 
time, I discovered the wounds they bore 
within them as part of a painful legacy 
that is passed down from generation 
to generation.
Among the young screenwriters, one 
girl stood out for her intelligence, her 
dynamism and her generosity. She was 
a leading figure in her community. Her 
name was Wapikoni Awashish. One day, 
her car hit a logging truck on the road. 
Her life was felled by the very people 
who cut down the trees on her land. She 
was twenty years old. It was a terrible 
shock! In her memory, we conceived 
the idea of  a place where young people 
could gather and create. That was 
how the Wapikoni project started. It 
was set up in 2004 by the indigenous 
community itself, with the support of the 
National Film Board and various public 
and private partners.

An introductory workshop on 
filmmaking, organized in 2017 
for indigenous youth 
from Lac-Simon, Canada.
Since then, caravans converted into film 
studios have been traversing Canada. 
How is this working out in the field?
Indeed, we created our first mobile 
audiovisual production unit, Wapikoni 
Mobile, in a ten-metre-long trailer – the 
bedroom became an editing room and 
the shower a sound studio. We have 
five of these mobiles today. They visit 
communities at their invitation. The 
work is supervised by filmmakers who 
are trainers – teachers who specialize 
in working with young people with 
difficulties, and local coordinators who 
schedule our visits.
We stay in the community for a month. 
On average, five short films are produced 
during this time, on topics chosen by the 
young people themselves. At the end, 
the films are screened for members of the 
community. Later, these films are screened 
at hundreds of events and festivals around 
the world – helping to promote this rich 
and often unknown culture.
What do these young people talk about 
in their films?
Everything! Love, family, nature, 
territory… Many talk about traditions, 
of their identity, of the rupture between 
tradition and modernity.

But they also produce contemporary 
creations, such as videos of community 
singers, often in indigenous languages. 
Elders also take this opportunity to 
transmit their knowledge in front of 
the camera, with complete confidence, 
because it is often their grandchildren 
who are interviewing and filming them.
Are these young people transformed 
by this experience?
Certainly. In general, this contributes 
to the affirmation of their pride in their 
identity and culture. It also revives the 
hope of finding a place in society, other 
than that of a consumer. There are also 
those who discover their vocation for 
cinema or music and who continue 
their training.
Wapikoni also serves as an educational 
intervention project. The team 
collaborates with local community 
resources to prevent dropping out 
of school, addiction and suicide – by 
helping youth to develop self-esteem 
and independence.
Can this approach be replicated in other 
communities around the world?
It can be, and we have more than one 
example as proof. Our pedagogical 
method of learning by creating has 
proven to be applicable elsewhere in 
the world, with adaptations to local 
conditions.
We have established partnerships in 
South America (Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, 
Panama and Chile). We’ve also worked 
with the Sámi [see our article on p. 26] 
in Norway, and more recently, I went to 
Budapest to develop a project to break 
the ostracism that affects Roma youth.
Other vulnerable populations have also 
been included in our programme, such 
as Syrian refugees in Turkey, or Bedouin 
communities in the Palestinian Territories 
and Jordan. In 2014, Wapikoni founded 
the International Network of Aboriginal 
Audiovisual Creation (INAAC), with the 
objective of exchanging experiences and 
developing co-productions.
You have been involved with Wapikoni 
for a long time. What has the project 
achieved in concrete terms?
On the individual level, it has helped 
save some lives. It’s not me who says this, 
it’s those who believe that they were 
saved who do.  
Collectively, it has helped to restore 
hope and self-confidence to indigenous 
communities, and to highlight them 
and give them international visibility. 
Finally, I also see Wapikoni as a caravan

Rapa Nui:
Back from the brink 
Interview by Jasmina Šopova 
and Carolina Rollan Ortega
Isolated in the middle of the 
Pacific Ocean, midway between 
the coasts of Chile and Tahiti, 
the young people of Rapa Nui 
(Easter Island) use Spanish to 
connect to the world. They 
have almost lost the use of their 
mother tongue, Rapa Nui, which 
is of Polynesian origin. Only ten 
per cent of youth master the 
language today, compared to 
seventy-six per cent forty years 
ago. María Virginia Haoa of the 
Rapa Nui Language Academy 
sounds the alarm.
Outdoor games at the traditional 
Tapati Rapa Nui festival, 
one of the largest cultural events 
in the Pacific, featuring indigenous 
music and dance.
Why is the disappearance of a language 
a problem?
Language is inseparable from our way 
of being, our thoughts, our feelings, our 
joys and much more. It is through our 
language that we show who we are. If our 
language disappears, the whole socio-
cultural foundation of our community of 
speakers is put at risk.
On Easter Island, the Rapa Nui 
language no longer has a place in the 
socio-economic development of our 
community. Discarded by public services 
and tourist activities, the Polynesian 
language is being swallowed up at 
a dizzying speed by Spanish, with 
significant negative consequences on the 
community’s values.
For example, family farming has been 
abandoned in favour of the consumption 
of national and transnational products, 
the origin and manufacturing methods of 
which are unknown. In the past, farmers 
observed the phases of the moon to 
determine when to plant their crops. 
Today, this is a lost art.

Practices such as sharing produce 
between families and neighbours – a 
traditional form of solidarity and 
interaction – have disappeared, even as 
intergenerational dialogue is dying out. 
Young people spend their time playing 
video games and on social media, 
reducing the amount of time they spend 
interacting with their elders. Sometimes it 
is the parents – who are too busy working 
to improve their material comfort – 
who neglect the most important task: 
educating their sons and daughters, 
including about their own culture.
What is the current status of Rapa Nui  
as a living language?
According to a sociolinguistic survey 
conducted in 2016 by the Ministry of 
Education of Chile (MINEDUC) and 
UNESCO, half of all Rapa Nui speakers are 
concentrated in the age group of over 40. 
In the 20- to 39-year age group, only 
about thirty-five per cent speak Rapa 
Nui. When they become parents, the vast 
majority do not transmit the vernacular 
language to their children. The daily 
language used by mixed-couple families 
(Rapa Nui and other) is generally Spanish.
It is becoming increasingly rare to find 
native-language speakers under 18. In 
1976, when the language was introduced 
as a subject in the school curriculum, 
seventy-six per cent of schoolchildren 
spoke Rapa Nui. In 1997, this fell to 
only twenty-three per cent. In 2016, 
the figure was reduced to ten per cent. 
This is an alarming figure for all of us who 
are concerned about the future of our 
language and our culture.
What have you done to preserve 
the linguistic heritage?
In 1990, we created the Department of 
Rapa Nui Language and Culture at the 
Lorenzo Baeza Vega school. With the 
support of CONADI [the indigenous 
development agency within the Ministry 
of Social Development] and the Ministry 
of Education, we – with the school’s Rapa 
Nui teachers – have produced primary 
education texts for science, history, 
mathematics, and for learning to read 
and write.
Since its inception in 2004, the Rapa 
Nui Academy has created pre-primary 
teaching materials and re-published 
reading and writing texts for the first 
two years of primary school. It has also 
produced two interactive CDs presenting 
the concepts of culture, mathematics 
and geometry.
The Academy devoted the year 2011 
to conducting a survey, with the aim of 
expanding to three other schools and 
a public kindergarten on the island. In 
2012, it participated in the evaluation 
of the law – passed in 2011 – to create 
an Indigenous Language Sector (ILS) in 
all schools attended by students of the 
indigenous peoples of Chile. 
What is the current situation of 
the language in the educational system?
When formal education was introduced 
on the island in 1934, Rapa Nui was 
not part of it. The students learned 
everything by heart, in Spanish, without 
understanding anything. It made no 
sense to them. In addition, they had to 
learn from content that was completely 
foreign to them. To take just one example, 
when we heard the phrase, “the sun rises 
in the cordillera”, we had no idea what it 
was about, because none of us had ever 
seen or heard of a mountain range.
Eight decades later, only one school, 
Lorenzo Baeza Vega, has a Rapa Nui 
immersion programme, which runs from 
pre-primary to fourth grade (ages 5 to 9). 
During its eighteen years of existence, 
this programme has had its ups and 
downs, depending on the changes in 
the number of hours allocated to the 
teaching of Rapa Nui. Because the school 
administration is obsessed with students 
scoring well on the SIMCE ( a national 
test), it has added hours of Spanish 
instruction in mathematics, language 
and physical education.
On Easter Island, 
the Rapa Nui language 
no longer has a place 
in the socio-economic 
development of 
our community
The Rapa Nui National Park, a UNESCO 
World Heritage site, is an open-air 
archaeological museum. Within it, Lake 
Rano Raruku is surrounded by moai, 
gigantic monolithic statues carved from 
the area’s volcanic stone. About 900 moai 
were carved in this exceptional quarry 
between the tenth and sixteenth centuries.

In 2017, we created the non-
governmental organization (NGO) 
Nid Rapa Nui, which takes in about 
twenty children aged 2 to 3 years. 
It is autonomous, but we receive 
support from government institutions 
to pay teachers and to improve our 
infrastructure. In 2018, we also received 
support from the Ma’u Henua Polynesian 
indigenous community, which helped 
pay teachers’ salaries. This association 
was founded in July 2016 with the aim 
of establishing a new management 
system for the Rapa Nui National Park, a 
UNESCO World Heritage site.
We are developing a teaching 
programme for the Nid Rapa Nui, which 
incorporates philosophical guidelines 
specific to the local culture, since the 
NGO’s objective is to start a school where 
courses will be taught entirely in the 
vernacular language.
Are there enough people capable 
of teaching in Rapa Nui?
No. We have enlisted several community 
leaders and employed traditional 
teachers. All of them bring the know-
how acquired within their families – 
and it is precious. But they need to be 
trained in planning and methodology, 
to improve the teaching of the Rapa Nui 
cultural content. 
To remedy the shortage of teachers, 
I believe that young people should be 
motivated to study to become teachers. 
This could be done by increasing the 
number of scholarships to encourage 
them to enroll in universities such as 
Waikato, in Aotearoa (New Zealand), 
or in Hilo, Hawaii, in the United States, 
which have extensive experience in 
teaching Polynesian languages.
Finally, we hope to convince a Chilean 
university to take on the training of 
Rapa Nui teachers remotely, through 
online courses.
Co-founder of the Rapa Nui Academy 
that she headed from 2004 to 2010, 
María Virginia Haoa is president of the 
NGO Nid Rapa Nui. She was awarded the 
Chilean government’s Gabriela Mistral 
Order of Merit in 2004 for her efforts to 
revitalize Rapa Nui. Haoa also goes by the 
name of Viki Haoa Cardinali.

In her Report to the thirty-ninth 
session of the Human Rights Council 
(10-28 September 2018), she wrote: 
“Added to this situation is the 
escalating number of criminal charges 
– reportedly in the hundreds – being 
filed in Guatemala against indigenous 
leaders and community members. 
The active participation of private 
entities in pressing charges implies that 
prosecutors and judges are colluding 
with companies and landowners in some 
of these cases.”

As the preferred media 
for defending the rights 
of indigenous peoples, 
community radio stations are 
not necessarily easily accessible, 
in spite of commitments made 
by the state. Many indigenous 
radio stations have no option 
but to operate illegally.
Radio: A lifeline
for indigenous
peoples
The role of radio
Indigenous community radio stations 
play a crucial role in defending the right 
to freedom of expression of indigenous 
peoples. Providing the most effective 
way of disseminating information on 
issues affecting the communities, they 
also reveal news of the violence that 
hits them. They are the first to broadcast 
information about the incidents, and to 
interview and air the views of community 
leaders on these acts of violence. 
There are some places in the world where 
broadcasting your voice can render you 
illegal, just as defending your rights as an 
indigenous person can cost you your life. 
On 21 September, Juana Ramírez Santiago, 
a 57 year-old Mayan lxil community leader, 
became the twenty-first human rights 
activist to be assassinated in Guatemala 
in 2018. She was one of those leaders 
who have a political vision and a desire 
to change society to ensure a better life 
for their families and communities. Most 
Guatemalans believe her murder, like 
many others, will go unpunished. 
Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples – who visited Guatemala in her 
official capacity twice in the same year 
– expressed concern about the forced 
evictions, criminalization and violence 
against indigenous peoples who defend 
their rights and their lands. Referring to 
the killings of seven defenders during and 
shortly after her visit in May 2018 [eleven 
defenders were killed between May and 
July that year], she observed, “All were 
representatives of two indigenous farmers’ 
organizations advocating for land rights and 
political participation. The killings took place 
in a broader national context of a pernicious 
closing of spaces for civil society.”
The Ixil Mayan community actively defends 
its cultural and linguistic identity.

The radio stations publicly support 
land and human rights defenders, and 
raise public awareness about their 
criminalization. This was the case with 
Radio Xyaab’ Tzuul Taq’a, a radio startup 
of the Maya Q’eqchi in El Estor, which 
supported several defenders who have 
been arbitrarily accused and imprisoned 
by the government for their human and 
land rights activities. 
A thwarted right
Many Latin American countries have 
enshrined in legislation the right of 
indigenous peoples to have their own 
media. But although many states have 
committed to assigning frequencies 
to these media, this is often not 
implemented. Numerous indigenous 
community radios are forced to 
broadcast without a licence even after 
requesting a frequency as required 
by law – and see their volunteers 
prosecuted for their radio activities. 
In Guatemala, for example, the right of 
indigenous peoples to their own media 
is guaranteed by the Constitution and 
the Peace Agreement signed in 1996, 
ending a civil war that lasted over 
thirty years. But the licences are so 
expensive that non-profit community 
radios do not have enough money 
to pay for them. In 2003, a frequency 
cost two million quetzales ($274,000), 
for a modulated frequency (FM) in 
areas outside Guatemala City and 
Quetzaltenango, the country’s second-
largest city. The current cost is unknown 
as public auctions have been stopped in 
recent years, though frequencies are still 
sold illegally by their owners. For small 
farmers this amount is more than they 
can afford. With a salary of $80 to $120 
a month, purchasing a frequency is an 
unattainable dream. 
Decolonizing minds
Radio has proven that it is able not only 
to mobilize indigenous peoples, but 
also to influence policies and to hold 
governments to account. Radio stations 
organize social audits on the budget 
expenses of municipal governments in 
indigenous communities, for example. 
They also organize campaigns about 
the conscious vote. At election time, 
candidates are invited to hold debates on 
the air and to receive questions from the 
public. This public space for politicians 
to be accountable reduces the margin of 
manipulation of the vote.
Community-based indigenous media is a 
powerful means to decolonize minds and 
create a sense of cultural and linguistic 
pride. Radio can be effectively used to 
highlight ancestral music and knowledge, 
and to inform people of the local forms of 
organization that are today threatened by 
globalization and the world-view imposed 
by major international media corporations.
The medium has particularly proven itself 
in the remote areas of Latin America, 
where the scourge of illiteracy prevents 
indigenous populations from accessing 
information from print sources and where 
older people, especially women – who 
very rarely know the dominant language 
– are unable to get information from 
mainstream radio stations.
Last but not least, the survival of 
indigenous languages depends to a very 
large extent on native speakers and their 
ability to speak them fluently. In this 
respect, indigenous media can and must 
play a decisive role. 
Avexnim Cojti, from the K’iche’ Maya 
community in Guatemala, is a Community 
Programme Manager at Cultural Survival 
(www.cs.org). Agnes Portalewska 
(Poland) is a Communications Manager 
at the indigenous peoples’ rights non-
profit. Headquartered in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts (United States), Cultural 
Survival has supported a global network 
of more than 800 indigenous radio 
stations since 2005.

UNESCO’s support to indigenous community 
radios 
In spite of the advances that have been made in the promotion of indigenous peoples’ 
media and rights, there are many examples around the world affirming that the 
mainstream media generally continues to discriminate against indigenous peoples.
Community media, in many cases, helps fill this gap. Produced by and for 
indigenous peoples, these media demand political inclusion, transparency and 
accountability, strengthen international solidarity and draw critical attention to 
human rights violations.
Recognizing the importance of community radio, UNESCO’s International 
Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) has funded 
approximately thirty indigenous people’s projects, since 2000. In addition, every 
biennium, UNESCO supports, on average, fifty community radio stations. 
The UNESCO Office in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, has organized and provided 
training on implementing community media projects and indigenous language 
radio programmes since 2007. UNESCO also donated essential radio equipment, 
and young indigenous producers were trained to design radio programmes, which 
are being broadcast on a daily basis for one hour per day in the Kreung, Tompon, 
Jarai and Brao languages. In response to the success of the project, an additional 
partner donated over 100 solar battery-powered radio receivers to the indigenous 
communities in May 2010, allowing some 400 families to access community radio 
and national channel programmes without purchasing batteries.

Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim:
Speaking up for the rights of the 
Mbororo
Interview by Domitille Roux
Recognized internationally, the indigenous peoples of Africa 
cannot always count on being granted the same recognition in 
their own countries. The Fulani Mbororo community, for example, 
is a long way from fully enjoying its rights, according to one of its 
strongest advocates, Hindu Oumarou Ibrahim. She is coordinator 
of the Association des Femmes Peules Autochtones du Chad 
(AFPAT, the association of indigenous Fulani women of Chad).
Without this essential document, it 
is impossible to obtain identity cards, 
passports, or access to education and 
health care. If a patient comes to the 
hospital without a birth certificate, not 
only is he the last to be examined, but he 
also risks receiving inappropriate care, 
since his age and needs are not known 
to the doctors.
Though many papers and directives 
do exist, in actual fact, we are on our 
own. We do not even have access 
to safe drinking water. The Mbororo 
drink the same water as animals – this 
promotes diseases that make them even 
more vulnerable.
Could you tell us more about AFPAT? 
What are the association’s projects since 
its creation in 1999, and especially since 
it obtained legal status in 2005?
Our main objective is to improve the 
living conditions in our community, 
and our work is supported by two 
programmes. The first focuses on the 
protection and promotion of human 
rights and the rights of indigenous 
peoples, in line with national and 
international declarations on the subject. 
The second concerns the protection of 
the environment, as provided for by the 
three Rio Conventions, which emerged 
from the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED, 
1992). They focus on climate change, 
biodiversity and desertification. 
In practice, we raise awareness of basic 
social rights through training sessions in 
education or access to health care. We 
also educate communities about access 
to justice – given their marginalization 
and the violence they suffer, it is essential 
to tell them that they have the right to 
justice and equity.
With regard to the protection and 
promotion of the environment, we 
organize training sessions and discussions 
with communities on adaptation to 
climate change and the importance of 
traditional knowledge and know-how 
for adaptation.
What results have you achieved through 
these awareness campaigns?
One of our successes is the creation 
of health centres adapted to nomadic 
communities, for example. We have also 
succeeded in integrating women into 
community debates. Now, women and 
men sit together to discuss their future.
At the legislative level, we contributed 
to a reform of the pastoral code, which 
dated back to 1958 and had become 
obsolete: the demography and 
environment have changed enormously 
since then. We are not entirely satisfied 
with the reform, but it is already a kind of 
victory for our association.
With regard to education, it must be 
understood that nomadic communities 
do not reject school, contrary to what 
is often thought. They simply want a 
school with programmes and schedules 
that are adapted to their way of life. 
What is the status of the Mbororo 
in Chad?
Thanks to the United Nations Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we 
have regional recognition from the five 
countries in which we are distributed: 
Cameroon, Central African Republic, 
Chad, Niger and Nigeria. However, at 
the national level, there are no laws that 
protect or recognize indigenous peoples.
In 2014, the current President of Chad, 
Idriss Deby Itno, who was then president 
of the Economic Community of Central 
African States, participated in the Third 
Edition of the International Forum of 
Indigenous Peoples of Central Africa 
(FIPAC 3), held in Impfondo, Republic 
of the Congo. At this international 
meeting on traditional skills and the 
green economy, he gave a speech in 
support of indigenous peoples. It was 
a considerable political endorsement 
and a very strong message in our favour. 
But the impact of this speech fizzled out 
– it was not published afterwards and 
remained ineffective.
How would you describe the living 
conditions of the Mbororo?
As unacceptable. At the very least, 
members of my community should 
be recognized as citizens of a country. 
However, half of them – particularly the 
women and children – do not even have 
a birth certificate. How then can they 
have rights?

Nomadic children have less need to know 
the history of world wars or the history 
of France than to learn how to manage 
natural resources, such as water, or about 
conflicts between communities. They 
also need teachers who understand their 
culture and master their language, which 
is essential for learning.
The creation, in 2012, of the directorate 
for the education of nomadic children 
was very encouraging news. This 
body took into account the needs of 
nomadic communities and set up pilot 
programmes adapted to the lives of their 
children. But for now, the Mbororo do not 
benefit from it.
What do you think of the Biosphere and 
Heritage of Lake Chad (BIOPALT) project*?
The project holds great promise for the 
restoration of the ecosystems of Lake 
Chad, the preservation of its resources 
and relations between the peoples of the 
neighbouring countries. What worries me 
is that it takes time to establish priorities, 
create protected areas, put in place 
pilot projects – time is running out and 
the budget is being used up before any 
concrete results are delivered.
In my opinion, this project will make a 
difference if the experts in charge of it 
establish a relationship of trust with the 
indigenous peoples. They have lived in 
these places for centuries; they are not just 
passing through, like some politicians. It is 
with, and for these populations that the 
project must be successfully completed.
* Launched in February 2018 by UNESCO, the 
project is designed to strengthen the capacity 
of the five states where the Mbororo live, to 
sustainably manage the hydrological, biological 
and cultural resources of the Lake Chad Basin, 
which supports more than 40 million people. 
Habituated to the livestock market in 
the border village of Gbiti (Cameroon), 
the Central African Mbororo herders 
took refuge there in 2014, fleeing 
the violence in their country.

The Inuit leading the expedition, active 
hunters from the community – Simeonie 
Kavik, Elijah Oquaituk and Lucassie Ippak 
– turned to the biologists and said, “This is 
what we’ve been telling you about. In the 
early 1990s, one of our elders noticed that 
there were as many dead eiders on the 
ice as there was gravel on the beach”. The 
hunters and elders of Sanikiluaq did alert 
the Canadian authorities at the time, but 
the phenomenon escaped the attention 
of the scientific community.
One of the biologists on the 2002 
expedition to study the eider die-offs 
had designed an underwater camera 
to film the eiders as they dove under 
the sea ice to forage in winter. I was a 
Ph.D. student at the time, and spent the 
next two winters at the edge of the sea 
ice – under the guidance of Kavik and 
Oquaituk – collecting footage tracking 
eider survival methods. 
Joel Heath, with 
Lucassie Arragutainaq
An Inuktitut word for sea ice, 
SIKU today refers to a web 
platform that is revolutionizing 
access to the ancient knowledge 
and current research of 
communities living in Canada’s 
Arctic zone. A story that 
began modestly with a few 
snap-shots of eider ducks 
struggling for survival on the 
ice floe has evolved into an 
extraordinary project over 
fifteen years, combining the 
oldest knowledge with the most 
modern technologies. 
Siku: 
It was colder than ever that winter 
day of 2002, in the Qikiqtaaluk region 
in Nunavut, Canada. Not far from the 
community of Sanikiluaq, a group of 
Inuit with harpoons led the way over 
the thin, newly-formed ice. A team of 
biologists cautiously and literally followed 
in their footsteps. The ice fog rising 
from the open water made the scene 
particularly dramatic.
A large floe edge on the east side of 
the Belcher Islands had recently frozen 
over, and a group of eider ducks were 
struggling to keep the remaining open 
water from freezing. This was critical for 
them to dive and access the mussels and 
sea urchins they relied on for food.
The edges of the ice were littered with 
the carcasses of dead ducks that had 
become frozen into the advancing ice. 
The footage was unprecedented. After 
seven years of working closely with 
almost all the families in Sanikiluaq, the 
project resulted in the documentary, 
People of a Feather (2011). The film, 
which went on to win a dozen awards, 
highlights the community’s unique 
relationship with eiders, and the shared 
challenges of environmental change 
that they face.
The Inuit of the Belcher Islands are not 
just interested in eider ducks – their 
life depends on them. While most 
birds, including eiders, migrate south, 
Hudson Bay eiders remain around the 
Belcher Islands through the winter. The 
community use eider skins to make 
traditional parkas and their meat is 
critical to food security year-round, in the 
absence of caribou here.

Putting together 
the puzzle pieces
It was in the wake of the film’s release that 
the Arctic Eider Society (AES) was formed 
in 2011. The groundwork was already 
well-prepared, thanks to the community-
driven research programmes developed 
with the support of the Canadian 
government’s International Polar Year 
(2007–2008) and to their mobilization, 
dating back to the early 1990s. Around 
the same time, the Sanikiluaq community 
launched a programme bringing 
together twenty-eight Inuit and Cree 
communities across Hudson Bay and 
James Bay, to synthesize their knowledge 
of environmental change. The project 
resulted in the 1997 publication, Voices 
from the Bay, which to this day remains 
a definitive source for knowledge on 
the region. 
An Inuit-driven charity, AES aims to 
empower local people to take charge of 
research, education and stewardship of 
their environment. The early programmes 
focused on assessing changes in 
oceanography and sea ice – training 
hunters and youth to use salinity and 
temperature profilers; establishing time-
lapse monitoring stations and carrying 
out ice-core and water sampling.
The creation of AES’s Community-
Driven Research Network was given top 
priority. It includes Sanikiluaq (Nunavut), 
Inukjuak, Umiujaq, Kuujjuaraapik 
(Nunavik region of Quebec) and Chisasibi 
(Cree community in the Eeyou Marine 
Region of Quebec).  
An eider duck hunter probes 
the condition of the ice.
Each of these neighbouring communities 
held a different piece of the puzzle, and 
by working together they could finally 
provide a larger picture of environmental 
change in the region. 
Drawing academic expertise from 
the University of Manitoba, Carleton 
University and ArcticNet and funding 
from the Nunavut General Monitoring 
Plan (NGMP), the Nunavik Marine 
Region Wildlife Board (NMRWB) and 
the Cree Nation of Chisasibi, the 
network has been able to develop 
partnerships. The increased capacity has 
allowed the tackling of new priorities, 
including those with the Northern 
Contaminants Program, and expanding 
to new regions with funding from Polar 
Knowledge Canada.
New priorities
As capacity continued to grow, 
the communities identified three 
new priorities – increasing youth 
engagement, helping bridge the larger-
scale jurisdictional challenges faced 
by the region, and sharing results and 
coordinating in near-real time.
To involve youth, the network has 
partnered with Kativik Ilisarniliriniq, 
the Nunavik School Board, to develop 
a holistic Inuit-centred approach 
to training and education in the 
sciences. This has resulted in the Arctic 
Sea Ice Educational Package. Using 
interactive multimedia tools, it allows 
young people to partner with hunters 
and to become directly involved in 
local research.
Regarding the second priority, the 
first-ever Hudson Bay Summit was 
held in 2018. It brought together 
twenty-seven Inuit and Cree 
communities from James Bay and 
Hudson Bay, and representatives of 
ninety-seven organizations, to form 
the Hudson Bay Consortium – a forum 
for collaboration and coordinated 
stewardship for a region with complex 
inter-jurisdictional governance.

To address the third priority of 
sharing data in near-real time, the five 
communities in the network created 
a web platform in 2014. A simple base 
map and corresponding timelines 
were built, with profiles for community 
researchers where the results of salinity 
profiling, ice-core sampling and 
contaminants-monitoring could be 
shared online. 
Not only did this prototype platform 
– initially named IK-MAP – prove 
compelling for data management 
among so many collaborators, it 
allowed each community to use its own 
knowledge systems to interpret data 
and see how their results fit into the 
bigger picture. In the past, the results of 
research programmes would end up, far 
too often, in an academic’s file cabinet 
down south, never to be seen again. 
Today the information is accessible 
to everyone, including tech-savvy 
Inuit youth. New features have been 
added, allowing photos and posts to 
be tagged – not just for individuals, 
but also for wildlife species and the 
Inuktitut terminology for ice types, 
and for measurements, remarks and 
observations of all kinds.

Google Street View 
of the Arctic sea ice 
In 2015, AES partnered with Google Earth 
Outreach to develop the first-ever Google 
Street View of remote sea ice – mapping 
not only the Sanikiluaq community, but 
also polynyas and floe edges in winter. 
The platform provided new ways for 
northerners and southerners to explore 
the Arctic sea ice.
The next step was to create a social 
media network and mapping platform, 
specifically by and for the Inuit. SIKU: 
The Inuit Knowledge Wiki and Social 
Mapping Platform was born, and came 
to life with new funding after winning 
the 2017 Google.org Impact Challenge 
in Canada. Siku, the Inuktitut word for 
sea ice, is itself a metaphor of ice as the 
structure of connectivity and change 
in the north. 
Currently in beta mode, the platform 
has brought together a wide range of 
tools and services important to the Inuit. 
Profiles for each community provide local 
weather, tides and sea-ice imagery from 
multiple satellites in near-real time. Its 
official launch is scheduled for late 2019. 
A mobile app has also been developed 
to significantly expand the scope of 
systematically documenting indigenous 
knowledge and observations. 
A new era
Of course, the mobile app is no 
replacement for using a harpoon to 
check the ice or for experiential learning 
through elders. But by combining the 
best of recent scientific approaches and 
centuries of indigenous knowledge, it 
is now possible to monitor dangerous 
sea-ice conditions, using Inuktitut 
terminology around the classification 
of ice, for example. It is hoped that 
this terminology will one day be 
integrated into machine learning 
approaches (artificial intelligence), so 
that indigenous communities can access 
relevant information remotely – in real 
time and in their own language.
Organizations and communities can 
now share their news, reports and blogs. 
Young people can immerse themselves 
in local culture by sharing hunting 
stories and traditional place names. 
Observations that were once typically 
written off as anecdotal by scientists 
can be systematically documented 
and quantified. The data management 
and permissions approach protection 
policy means local populations can now 
be in charge of managing their data, 
intellectual property and how they 
choose to share it. 
The project, which began about fifteen 
years ago with a few snap-shots of ducks 
on the ice floe, is now flying on its own 
– well beyond the winter ecology of the 
Hudson Bay eiders.

The umbilical
cord
The Tuawhenua explain
their attachment to the land
The notion of tătai whakapapa is 
fundamental to the world-view of the 
Tuawhenua. These Maori of New Zealand 
believe that everything that exists in 
their world is genealogically connected 
– bats, lizards, birds, insects, trees, 
plants, mountains, rivers and lakes. This 
connectedness provides strength to the 
ecosystem. As these elements are eroded, 
so is the resilience and integrity of the 
environment and the tribe.
The same tradition applies to the pito, or 
umbilical cord – the action of burying it 
on your lands signifies your permanent 
connectedness to Papatŗănuku, Mother 
Earth. It connects you to your place in 
the world.
Maintaining ties to the land and its 
resources is critical to the Tuawhenua, 
as this is perceived as an expression 
of their mana, authority or power. 
Regardless of hardships and downfalls 
and whatever was happening in the 
world, the Tuawhenua elders recognized 
the need to always uphold the mana 
of the individual, of the hapŗ or the 
sub-tribe, and of the iwi, the tribe. 
The elders understood it was hard for 
some to keep ties and bonds to the land, 
the waterways, the animals and the birds 
– but these were all seen to be part of 
what it means to be Tuawhenua. 
The elders recognized that mana was 
one of the most important principles for 
their people. But it was reinforced by the 
concept of mauri, the life force or essence 
of life. When the Tuawhenua refer to 
the purity in their culture, it reflects the 
mauri of the environment. For them, the 
mauri of the forest can never be taken 
away. As long as the rivers flow, as long 
as one tree stands, the life force cannot 
be extinguished – every element of the 
world has a certain level of mauri.

Tuawhenua community), with Phil Lyver

Pollination, UNESCO, 2015.
For the Tuawhenua, it is the whenua, or 
the land, that defines who you are and 
where you come from. The word also 
means placenta. In both cases, whenua 
refers to your beginning and to your 
connection with your mother – the one 
who gave you life.
When Tuawhenua women give birth, 
wherever they are in the world, the 
placenta must be brought back home 
and be buried on the tribal lands.

Dai Rong and Xue Dayuan
The Dong people, a Chinese 
ethnic minority who have 
lived for thousands of years in 
Congjiang county, in the heart 
of Guizhou province, were 
ecologists before their time. 
Centuries ago, they invented 
an agricultural system that we 
would term “green” today – 
producing organic food while 
preserving the stability and 
diversity of local ecosystems. 
The “Rice-Fish-Duck” Symbiotic 
System is the direct result of 
their ancestral wisdom.
Of rice, fish, ducks and 
humans
Inhabited mainly by the Dong, the Miao, 
and thirteen other ethnic minorities, 
Congjiang county is lacking in arable 
land. Faced with a hostile environment, 
the Dong have shown genius by 
inventing an agricultural production 
system that provides economic, 
ecological, social and cultural benefits.
Relying on their ancestral practices to 
this day, they allow the ecosystem to 
recycle the flow of energy and material. 
Traditional varieties of glutinous rice have 
been preserved, and are cultivated on 
terraces where they also breed fish. When 
the fish grow to ten centimetres in size, 
ducklings are introduced to the terraced 
fields for breeding. 
Dating back to the Eastern Han dynasty 
(25 AD to 220 AD), the “Rice-Fish-Duck” 
system is based on the biological and 
ecological characteristics of the various 
organisms, where the needs of each are 
respected. This is done making full use 
of the available solar energy, water and 
mineral resources – creating a production 
structure that benefits all.
For the villagers of Congjiang county 
who live in isolation in the mountains, 
these rice fields are the main source 
of food. Over a hundred kinds of 
edible wild plants including fern, 
bamboo shoots and funghi co-exist 
with the rice varieties – as do taro, 
lotus root, water celery and plantain. 
Aquatic animals such as snail, eel, and 
loach are also eaten, providing the 
inhabitants with high-quality protein. 
The organic farming model increases 
the market value of the fish and 
ducks, which sell for twice as much as 
conventional products. 
Covering an area of approximately 
12,600 hectares, the rice shoots provide 
shade and organic food for the fish 
and ducks, who in turn, feed on pests 
and produce an excellent manure – 
thus playing a major role in weeding, 
fertilizing and oxygenating the rice 
fields. The varieties of rice, ducks and 
fish are all local and do not require any 
pesticides, because the system offers 
them excellent protection against 
diseases. This effectively preserves the 
diversity of local agricultural species 
and ecosystems, and also considerably 
reduces animal feed and labour costs.

In China’s Congjiang county, 
all hands are at work to harvest rice 
in the autumn.
A new lease of life
Nevertheless, this traditional agricultural 
system is threatened by globalization 
and the high productivity and 
efficiency of modern agriculture. The 
indiscriminate introduction of exotic 
high-yield crop varieties has caused 
the area under the system to decrease 
each year. Also, the large-scale use of 
pesticides and fertilizers over several 
decades has caused serious farmland 
and water pollution in the region, 
threatening food security. 
An increasing number of Chinese 
citizens are becoming aware of the 
shortcomings caused by modern 
agricultural production, and realizing 
the importance of healthier and better-
quality food for their societies. They have 
started advocating the use of traditional 
practices in the future development of 
agriculture. This should ideally protect 
ancient agriculture systems – ensuring 
higher incomes for farmers, and the 
protection of the environment. It would 
also help promote tourism to the region 
and the preservation of the country's 
cultural heritage. 
This new awareness is expected to 
provide a fresh lease of life for the “Rice-
Fish-Duck” system, which could serve 
as an inspiration for modern agriculture 
in China and other parts of the world 
where similar natural conditions 
prevail. It is an invaluable resource that 
could help provide solutions to the 
problems caused by agricultural and 
environmental degradation worldwide. 
Chinese specialists in the field of 
traditional knowledge of ethnic 
minorities, Dai Rong and Xue Dayuan 
have contributed to the work of 
the Intergovernmental Science-
Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Dai Rong, 
an ethnoecologist from the Tujia ethnic 
minority, works at the Nanjing Institute 
of Environmental Sciences. Xue Dayuan 
is a professor at the Faculty of Life and 
Environmental Sciences of the Minzu 
University of China. 
The traditional agricultural system 
is threatened by globalization and 
the efficiency of modern agriculture
Recognizing 
indigenous knowledge
Traditional knowledge encompasses 
the understandings, skills and 
philosophies of the ecological, 
cultural and social systems that have 
developed throughout the world 
over millennia. However, it is often 
absent from scientific debate, just 
as its holders are often excluded 
from political decisions on the 
access, use and management of land 
and resources, which are crucial to 
their economic, social and cultural 
well-being.
An integral part of the intangible 
heritage of humanity, indigenous 
knowledge began to be recognized 
as an intellectual system in the 
1950s, notably through Harold 
Conklin's work on the ethnoecology 
of the Hanunoo people of the 
Philippines. But on an international 
level, recognition came only in 1992, 
during the Earth Summit in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil – shortly after the 
1989 UNESCO Recommendation 
on the Safeguarding of Traditional 
Culture and Folklore. 
UNESCO defends the right of 
local and indigenous peoples 
to participate in governance 
processes – advocating for the 
full recognition of their proven 
knowledge, experience and practices 
in biodiversity management. This 
is one of the objectives of LINKS, its 
programme on local and indigenous 
knowledge systems. Launched in 
2002, the programme also aims 
to ensure an equitable place for 
indigenous knowledge in formal 
and informal education and to 
strengthen its transmission.
Recognizing this agro-ecosystem as 
“an extraordinary living model of 
water and soil resources”, the Food 
and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) designated it 
as a Globally Important Agricultural 
Heritage Systems (GIAHS) site in 2001. 
This outstanding example of Chinese 
alpine agriculture was included by the 
Chinese government in the first round 
of the country’s Important Agricultural 
Heritage Systems in 2013.

The Sámi 
of Jokkmokk:
Challenging modernity
Marie Roué
The territory in Swedish Lapland, where the indigenous Sámi 
raise their reindeer, is threatened by logging, the railway, dams 
and urban growth. To survive, the herders have adopted a variety 
of strategies that range from the partial adaptation of an urban 
lifestyle, to using their traditional knowledge to accurately 
understand the state of their pastures.
A tremendous capacity 
to adapt
Let’s take the example of Jokkmokk. This 
major centre for reindeer husbandry in 
Sweden, in Norrbotten (which covers 
100,000 square kilometres, or a quarter of 
the country), is home to some 4,000 Sámi 
reindeer herders. They face many threats 
to their territory but at the same time, 
have an extraordinary capacity for 
resilience. Did they not adapt the first 
time, by inventing reindeer husbandry 
– even though they were fishermen, 
trappers and wild reindeer hunters – 
when the arrival of the first Scandinavian 
settlers four or five centuries ago caused 
a drastic decrease in the population of 
wild animals?
The Sámi also managed to overcome the 
devastation caused at the beginning of 
the twentieth century, when the English 
and the Scandinavians exploited their 
rivers – by creating dams to generate 
electricity – and dug their mountains to 
extract iron ore and produce steel.
The reindeer herders resisted again in 
the 1960s, when forestry became an 
industrial activity in Sweden and Finland 
at the expense of forest biodiversity. 
Later, in the 1970s, the Sámi created one 
of the first environmental alliances in 
Alta, Norway – bringing together human 
rights defenders and indigenous peoples 
to oppose the dam that would have 
led to the demolition of an important 
winter village.
The advance of colonization increasingly 
threatened their fishing and hunting 
rights and their rights to the land. Yet the 
reindeer herders are still there.
Facing serious threats
The Sámi of Jokkmokk take their reindeer 
to spend the summer in the mountains, 
descending to the forests in the plains 
in autumn. These forests are now being 
exploited industrially and the pastoralists 
are forced to share their usufruct rights 
with forest landowners. This coexistence 
poses a considerable challenge because 
the timber growers practise clear-cutting 
the forests before reseeding them, and 
their heavy machinery degrades the soil 
and destroys the lichen that reindeer feed 
on, by digging snow. It takes thirty to fifty 
years for the lichen to grow back!
And that's not all. The breeding territory 
for the reindeer is now traversed 
and divided by a railway line that 
transports iron ore and passengers. 
Dams and artificial lakes obstruct the 
herders’ migration routes, while roads, 
cities and mines further reduce the 
grazing pastures.
Today, the Sámi must overcome a new 
challenge: climate change. In the north, 
it is not so much the global warming 
that is feared, as its consequences on the 
instability of winter temperatures. When 
the snow is covered with a layer of ice 
after successive heating and cooling, the 
reindeer can no longer dig for food. 
The Sámi, previously known as the Lapps, 
have lived in Europe’s Arctic Circle for 
thousands of years. It is estimated that 
there are now nearly 80,000 of them, the 
majority of whom live in the far north, 
in Sápmi (Lapland), which spans four 
countries – Finland, Norway, Russia and 
Sweden. Some have settled further south, 
notably in Oslo and Stockholm.
The indigenous people have set up a 
Sámi Council, which allows them to think 
about the future of their nation together, 
beyond the national borders that have 
never prevented them from feeling that 
they are one people. They have always 
had the remarkable ability to embody 
modernity while remaining rooted in 
tradition. They gave the United Nations 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
(UNPFII) its first president and are actively 
involved in the Arctic Council. 
Regarding their political representation, 
the Sámi Parliament of Finland was 
created in 1973, followed by the Sámi 
Parliament of Norway in 1989 and the 
Sámi Parliament of Sweden, in 1993.
The Sámi practise many trades. Some of 
them are well-known artists or intellectuals, 
painters, sculptors, journalists, writers, 
filmmakers or singers – such as the Finnish 
writer, musician and artist Nils-Aslak 
Valkeapää (1943-2001) or the Norwegian 
musician Mari Boine. However, the 
traditional Sámi profession par excellence 
remains that of reindeer herding.

Unlike Western science, which has a 
static vision of load capacity (the number 
of animals that a given territory can 
support) based on a quantified botanical 
analysis, Sámi science is the science of 
immanence.
To assess the condition of a pasture, 
they dig and examine the layers and 
crystallography of the snow, thus 
estimating successive events through 
the seasons – the evolution of wind, 
temperatures, forest, ground vegetation – 
and their interrelationships with reindeer. 
Therefore, they may not know the richness 
of the pasture in absolute terms, but are 
experts at gauging its condition at the time 
and place of their analysis, which allows 
them to act in the most appropriate way. 
As climate change specialists, the Sámi 
base their resilience on their knowledge 
and practices, even if their capacity 
for action is limited by the severity of 
global change.
A French-Canadian researcher at 
the Laboratory of Eco-anthropology 
and Ethnobiology at the National 
Museum of Natural History (MNHN) in 
Paris, Marie Roué is Senior Research 
Director at the National Centre for 
Scientific Research (Centre national de 
la recherche scientifique, CNRS). 
To gather his reindeer, 
this Sami herder from Kautokeino, 
Norway, uses a long band 
of jute cloth.
Modern and ancient 
survival strategies
When reindeer can no longer feed 
themselves, the herders are forced to 
buy hay or dry food pellets (which are 
expensive and not always tolerated by 
the animals), or better still, bags of lichen. 
Sometimes they gather lichen in areas 
where the reindeer cannot go, such as 
around an airport, for example. These 
are part of the new survival strategies 
adopted by the Sámi.
In addition, to supplement their income, 
they now try to sell reindeer meat 
directly or resort to temporary work in 
tourism. Women often turn to permanent 
employment as teachers, doctors, 
journalists, dressmakers or shopkeepers 
to balance the family budget – which 
has been weakened by the fall in their 
reindeer-herding income. 
But the Sámi’s best weapon is their 
traditional knowledge. With a precise and 
detailed vocabulary, their knowledge of 
snow and metamorphism allows them 
to constantly monitor the condition of 
the pastures.

It is our highway and our supermarket. 
Today our ocean is a shadow of its former 
self – increasingly polluted, acidified, 
overfished, warmer and rising. 
For thousands of years our parents have 
taught us to respect and care for the 
ocean. But the forces that attack and 
damage our ocean today are beyond our 
control to manage.
We are a sailing people. We have always 
sailed and our ‘canoes’ were the fastest and 
largest sailing ships in the world when the 
Europeans first sailed into our ocean.

My name is Fuluna Tikoidelaimakotu

Korova, near Suva, the capital. But my 
people are from an even smaller island, 
Moce (“mo-they”), in the Lau group.
We are an ocean people. For most of our

Ocean, the land is a place we go to rest. 
The ocean is our real home. The ocean 
has always provided for us, fed us and 
protected us.

In the eighteenth century, Captain Cook 
described how the Tu'i Tonga "sailed 
around our ship as if we sat at anchor". The 
Tu'i Tonga was a drua [a double-hulled 
traditional sailing boat] built in my home 
of the Lau Islands. It was bigger than 
Cook's ship, with more men, three times 
faster than Cook's and capable of sailing 
as close to windward as a modern yacht.
Pinnacle 
of technological 
achievement
The drua was the pinnacle of 
technological achievement. They 
were built without metal, using 
only wood, grass, nuts, stone, bone 
and sharkskin. Using all the learned 
knowledge of thousands of years 
of ocean sailing, our ancestors in 
our tiny islands built thousands of 
these great craft and exported them 
throughout the central Pacific. Every 
island had its own transport, powered 
by free and continuously available 
renewable energy.
The reports of all European 
explorers described the Pacific as an 
ocean covered by sails. We were a 
mobile people. 
Despite the cyclones, tsunamis and 
other natural disasters, which are 
common in the Pacific, our ancestors 
never saw the ocean as a barrier. They 
never talked about being 'vulnerable', 
'isolated', 'remote': our drua – our 
ability to sail at will – meant we were 
always connected. We were not "small", 
"islands" or "developing" countries. 
We were – and still are – large ocean 
communities. 
The islands of the Lau group are often 
described as beautiful, idyllic, unspoilt 
and our people as one of the most 
hospitable and friendly in the world. 
And so we are. 
A train wreck
But the reality is more complex: our 
Pacific countries are on the frontline of 
climate change. Not that it's any fault 
of ours, but we are on a slow-moving 
train wreck that now drives us from our 
coasts and atolls, that turns our oceans 
to an acidic, plastic-filled soup, that 
bleaches our coral and destroys our 
water and food supplies. For some of us, 
it will entirely destroy our homes, our 
countries and our cultures. For all of us, 
it means unprecedented change, often 
beyond the capacity of our elders to 
guide us or our children to prepare for. 
My village has never had an outboard 
motor. We are one of a handful of 
communities that still sail on our ocean. 
My elders are the last that still know 
how to build and maintain sailing 
canoes. My own father died when I was 
three years old, sailing one of the last 
drua from the Lau to Suva. 
My community is a remnant of what 
it once was. Our canoes are small – 
only shadows of the giant drua our 
grandfathers and their fathers built. We 
use them every day to go to the reef, to 
fish and forage for our supplies. But we 
can now only dream of the day when 
our chiefs send us out to sail in great 
fleets to other countries on the other 
side of our known world.
A child's dream  
So what can be done? We are not 
accepting our fate passively. There is a 
renaissance of our seafaring heritage 
occurring across our ocean. In the last 
few years, I have been fortunate enough 
to sail with a small fleet of ocean-going 
canoes from across the Pacific.
We have crossed our ocean repeatedly 
– from island to island and now from 
continent to continent – America and 
Australia – spreading our message 
of hope that the world can wake up 
from its self-induced globalization and 
consumer-good driven coma in time to 
stop the senseless destruction of our 
ocean and our planet. 
There are signs that the revitalization 
of canoe culture is now happening in 
every small corner of our ocean – from 
Manus Island in Papua New Guinea to 
Namdrik Atoll in the Marshall Islands to 
the archipelagos of French Polynesia. 
We know it is only a small step, one that 
is not likely to be enough to turn back 
the rising tide.
But if we lose our sailing culture, we 
surely lose everything. Our canoes were 
once called Waqa Tabu – sacred ships. 
They are our icons, our heritage, our 
definition of who and what we are. They 
are symbols of a time when we did live in 
tune with wind and wave, when we were 
truly big people on a great ocean. 
The linkage with the past that our 
canoes provide is not quite severed. 
Although we have little resourcing, 
we are moving now to ensure the 
knowledge that is still held by our elders 
does not pass from this earth when 
they do – but that it is recorded for 
generations to come. We are building 
new canoes, only small ones at first, but 
we continue to plan for the day when we 
launch our drua upon the waters of the 
Pacific again.
We must start from the beginning. 
Preparation for the future begins with 
the lessons of the past. When we were 
children, our parents taught us to make 
Bakanawa – model drua that we raced 
after school and on weekends. I consider 
myself to be the most fortunate of my 
generation – one of only a few that 
grew up sailing on the ocean the ways 
my ancestors have done for thousands 
of years.
So what can I do in the face of climate 
change? It seems the best thing I can 
do is to build a drua and sail it back to 
the Lau.

In the land of 
wild rivers
Photos: Protick Sarker
Text: Katerina Markelova
With this photo-reportage, 
the Courier marks World Water Day, 
celebrated on 22 March.
Bangladeshi photographer Protick Sarker 
was still a high school student in the 2000s 
when he discovered the novel Padma 
River Boatman by Manik Bandopadhyaya 
– a classic of twentieth-century Bengali 
literature. The very special relationship 
between people and water – bringing 
both prosperity and destruction – 
depicted in the book, is familiar to him. 
Born in the land of wild rivers, Sarker, like 
his 162 million fellow citizens, lives to the 
rhythm of the monsoons – which inundate 
a third of the country every year, between 
May and September. 
These floods have devastating effects, 
both on the land and the people, as 
does the river erosion, which causes 
the loss of between 1,500 hectares and 
3,500 hectares of arable land each year*. 
But it is these same floods that make 
the fields of the Bengal Delta, which 
Bangladesh shares with India, so fertile.

to extreme weather events, according to the Internal 
Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC).

Composed of sediments carried by 
Bangladesh’s 230 rivers, these well- 
aerated and irrigated lands attract farmers 
to settle along the riverbanks in spite of 
the risk. “The king in the morning becomes 
a beggar in the evening,” sing the peasants 
who have lost everything, and yet return 
to the riverside to rebuild their lives.
The incredible ability of his people to 
live on these lands that are built and 
destroyed by the floods, had fascinated 
Sarker as a young student. Becoming a 
professional photographer a few years 
later, he set out on a journey along the 
majestic Padma river, starting from the 
border between Bangladesh and India, 
where India’s Ganges surges into the 
Bangladeshi river. 
And then, as the day of 3 November 2011 
was coming to an end, he witnessed the 
abrupt collapse of a stretch of riverbank, 
engulfed by the waters. “Suddenly I saw 
the river erosion which I had read about 
at school, happening brutally before 
my very eyes,” said Sarker. The event 
occurred in the Ishwardi upazila (district 
subdivision). “Seeing these people lose 
their homes, their land, everything… and 
at the same time seeing them remain 
strong and optimistic, and still going 
on with their lives, touched me deeply.” 
The man from Dhaka kept returning to 
the area for seven years to complete 
his photographic series, Of River and 
Lost Lands.
“It is the story of the places that have 
disappeared, which have been taken by 
the river. I wanted the images to convey 
a certain melancholy, a sense of loss,” 
says Sarker, who photographed Ishwardi 
only under foggy monsoon skies. “The 
series shows how vulnerable we human 
beings are to nature. But it also shows 
the cycle of the perpetual renewal of life, 
which I was keen to explore in my work.” 
Ephemeral islands, called chars, emerge 
from the waters after each monsoon 
and welcome thousands of people left 
without land**.
The adversity of the elements, to which 
humans seem to have adjusted as best 
they can, is worsening day by day due to 
climate change.

Bangladesh, which is predominantly flat 
and low-lying, is particularly exposed 
to rising sea levels. The multiplication 
and intensification of extreme weather 
events and the increasing melting of the 
Himalayan glaciers, where the rivers of 
the delta originate, make the nation one 
of the world’s most vulnerable.
The fragile balance that can be observed 
in Sarker’s photographs is being severely 
put to the test.

migrations, five million people were living on these 
ephemeral islands in 2010.

Freedom means freedom of choice. 
A man exercises his freedom when, 
confronted by two or more possible 
alternatives, he realizes one and excludes 
the rest. Free choices are definite choices. 
Liberal theologians were foolish to get 
excited over Heisenberg’s Principle. 
Vagueness of behaviour may be good 
enough for electrons, it is not good 
enough for free men.
Choices are of three kinds:
• choices of action. A thirsty man in a 
desert is unfree, not because he cannot 
satisfy his craving for water, but because 
he cannot choose between drinking and 
not drinking.
• choices of value judgement; good 
or evil, true or false, beautiful or 
ugly, absolute or relative, required or 
forbidden.  
A man who has seen only one picture is 
unfree to decide whether it is beautiful or 
ugly. A man in a passion of anger or fear is 
unfree because he is no longer conscious 
of any alternative state and so cannot 
judge his anger or his fear.
• choices of authority: this God or man or 
organization is to be believed or obeyed, 
that is not. Here again, if there is no 
consciousness or possible alternatives, 
there is no freedom. 
The cravings of man’s spirit are totally 
unlike the appetites of his nature, such 
as hunger and sex. There are two of 
them: to be free from conditions and to 
be important. These can and often do 
conflict, for the former senses anything 
that is “given” whether by his own 
nature or by the world about him as 
a limitation on his freedom and longs 
to act gratuitously, yet it is precisely 
and only from the “given” that he can 
derive a sense of importance. Absolute 
arbitrariness would at the same time be 
absolute triviality.
Reflections on freedom
and art
Wystan Hugh Auden
“Poets are not the 
unacknowledged legislators 
of the world, and never were 
and it is a good thing that they 
should be made to realize this,” 
writes W.H. Auden, dismissing 
the famous claim by English 
poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. 
Here, in this text written in 
1947, the English-American 
writer questions the limits of 
freedom and art, their potential 
and their interactions. Far from 
the Romantic vision of art that 
gives it more importance than it 
actually has, Auden advocates 
the Shakespearean vision: art 
holding a mirror to nature. 
Art as play
One of man’s attempts to satisfy 
both is the criminal acte gratuit, the 
breaking of a given law for the sake of 
breaking it, where the law supplies the 
importance, and the act of breaking 
it asserts the freedom. Another is play 
where the laws governing the game 
are kept by the player because they are 
chosen by him. At bottom, all art, all 
pure science, all creativity is play in this 
sense. The question What is Art? and the 
question Why does the artist create? are 
different questions. 
It seems to me that the basic impulse 
behind creativity of any kind is the desire 
to do something that is quite necessary: 
the desire that the result should turn out 
to be important comes second.
The rules of a game give it importance to 
the player by making it difficult to play, 
a test and proof of an inborn gift or an 
acquired skill. Given that a game is morally 
permissible, then whether or not one 
should play it depends simply on whether 
or not it gives one pleasure, i.e., whether 
or not one is good at playing it. If one asks 
a great surgeon why he operates, if he is 
honest, he will not answer: “Because it is 
my duty to save lives” but “Because I love 
operating”. He may perfectly well hate his 
neighbour and nevertheless save his life 
because of the pleasure it gives him to 
exercise his skill.
One must say therefore that, in the 
profoundest sense, art and science are 
frivolous activities for they depend on 
the chance possession of special talents. 
The only serious matter is concerned 
with what every human being has alike, 
a will, namely that one shall love one’s 
neighbour as oneself. Here one cannot 
speak of a talent for love, nor in terms of 
pleasure and pain. 
“Reflections on Freedom and Art” 
by W. H. Auden is reprinted in the

This text is the writer's response 
to UNESCO's 1947 survey on the 
philosophical foundations of human 
rights. The survey featured in the 
Wide Angle section of the Courier’s

If one asks the good Samaritan why he 
rescues the man fallen among thieves, 
he cannot answer, except as an ironical 
joke, “Because I like doing good” since 
pleasure or pain are irrelevant and 
the point is obeying the command: 
“Thou shalt love”.
A common love
There are three kinds of human groups.
• Crowds, i.e., two or more individuals 
whose sole common characteristic is 
togetherness, e.g., four strangers in a 
railway carriage.
If there is no 
consciousness 
or possible 
alternatives, 
there is 
no freedom
• Societies, i.e., two or more individuals 
united for the purpose of carrying out 
an action which requires them all, e.g., 
a string quartet.
• Communities, i.e., two or more 
individuals united by a common love for 
something other than themselves, e.g., a 
room full of music lovers.
Societies have a definite size and a 
definite structure and the character of the 
whole is different from the simple sum of 
the characters of the parts. Consequently 
the will of the individual member is 
subordinate to the general will of the 
society, however that is established.

Someone in the string quartet must 
have the authority to decide whether 
it is to play Mozart or Beethoven and 
the rest must obey whether they agree 
with the choice or not. A society may at 
the same time be a community but not 
necessarily. It is quite possible that the 
cellist of our quartet hates music and 
only plays to earn his living. A society 
is a free society as long as the member 
who exercises authority does so with 
the free consent of the other members. 
Societies function best when they are 
free, but in certain cases coercion can, 
and indeed must, be applied to compel 
a recalcitrant member to contribute his 
partial function, the moral justification 
depending on two factors:
• the importance of the function the 
society discharges
• the degree to which the recalcitrant 
member can or cannot be replaced by 
another more willing individual.
Communities, like crowds, have no 
definite size. It is impossible therefore to 
speak of the “general will” of a community 
since the individuals who belong to it 
cannot disagree; they are a community 
precisely because as individuals they all 
love the same thing (unlike members of 
crowds who have no love in common). 
In Time Magazine, of June 23[1947], Mr 
Vladimir Koretsky was reported as having 
said at the United Nations Conference 
on Human Rights: “Man should have no 
rights that place him in opposition to 
the community. Man opposed to the 
community is nothing”. If the translation 
is correct, Mr Koretsky was talking 
nonsense. 
An individual can be in opposition to 
a society, e.g., if the cellist plays out of 
tune, but if the rest of the quartet love 
the music of Mozart and he detests it, 
this simply means that there are two 
communities, a community of Mozart 
lovers and a potential community of 
Mozart haters, for a community can begin 
with a single individual, while a society 
cannot exist until all its members are 
present and correctly related. 
There are two kinds of communities: 
closed or unfree, and open or free. The 
members of a closed community have a 
common love but they have not chosen 
it for they are unaware of any other love 
which they could prefer to, or reject for, 
the love they have. The members of 
an open community have consciously 
chosen their love out of two or more 
possible loves. 
Art as looking glass
If I understand either the myth of 
Orpheus or Aristotle’s doctrine of 
catharsis correctly, the Greeks held what 
is, to me, a false theory of art which has 
plagued the world ever since, namely, 
that art is a magic device for arousing 
desirable emotions and expelling 
undesirable emotions, and so leading to 
right action. If this were so, then I think 
Plato’s censures of art in The Republic and 
Tolstoy’s in What is Art? are unanswerable. 
For me the correct definition is 
Shakespeare’s holding the mirror up 
to nature, i.e., art does not change my 
feelings but makes me conscious of 
what I have in fact felt or what I might 
feel, and of actual or possible relations 
between my feelings. The world of art is a 
looking-glass world, i.e., a possible image 
of the actual world where emotions are 
observed, divorced from their origin in 
immediate passion. It is the business of 
the artist to make a mirror which distorts 
the world as little as possible and reflects 
as much of the world as possible. Bad art 
distorts; minor art reflects only a small or 
trivial corner of the world.

by the Spanish artist Pejac, 2014.

Art does not judge
Art has two values: firstly it gives pleasure, 
the pleasure of idle curiosity; secondly, 
it enlarges the field of freedom. If man 
had no imagination, he could not make 
a choice between two possible courses 
of action without taking both, or make 
a value judgement about a feeling of his 
until he had felt the opposite.
Art does not and cannot influence the 
choice or judgement man actually 
makes, it only makes it more of 
a conscious choice.
Reading Macbeth, for instance, cannot 
prevent a man from becoming a 
murderer, but the man who has read 
Macbeth knows more about what 
becoming a murderer would be like than 
the man who hasn’t, so that, if he chooses 
to become one, he is more responsible. 
Art, in other words, is never a means for 
converting a bad community into a good 
one, it is one of the great means by which 
closed communities are turned into 
open communities.
Art can do harm in two ways. Firstly by 
failing to be good art and giving the 
wrong kind of pleasure thereby. If the 
reflection of the world which it offers 
is distorted, if it flatters the spectator 
by omitting the possibilities of evil or 
draws him to despair by denying the 
possibilities of good (which, surprisingly 
enough, can also give pleasure), then it 
injures him. 
Secondly and more seriously, because 
the better the art the greater the danger, 
it may ensnare the spectator in the 
luxurious paralysis of self-contemplation 
so that, like Hamlet, he fails to choose at 
all. The danger of great art is narcissism. 
Narcissus does not fall in love with 
his reflection because it was beautiful 
but because it is his own in all its 
endless possibilities. 
One can tell the myth in another way: 
Narcissus was a hydrocephalous idiot; 
catching sight of himself in the pool, 
he cried: “On me it looks good”. 
Or again: Narcissus was neither beautiful 
nor ugly but as commonplace as a 
Thurber husband*; catching sight of 
himself in the pool, he said: “Excuse me, 
but haven’t we met before some place?”
Art can encourage the formation of 
two kinds of bad communities, the 
community of those with false pictures 
of themselves, and the parody of a free 
community in which the knowledge of 
good and evil is turned against the will, 
till it becomes too weak to choose either.
Every work of art is the focus of the 
potential community of those individuals 
who love it or could love it. Such a 
community is free if the artist could 
have created something else but chose 
to create this work, and vice versa, the 
spectators or readers could have chosen 
to look at or read another work but 
chose to look at or read this. If the artist 
creates a work which no one but he 
appreciates or a spectator cannot find 
any work which he likes, there is no lack 
of freedom, but simply no community. 
Freedom can be curtailed in two ways; 
the artist may be forced to alter his work 
so that the character of the community is 
other than it would have been if he were 
left alone; or people may be prevented 
from becoming acquainted with his work 
so that the community is smaller than it 
might have been. 
Censorship
Censorship can be of two kinds, an 
unplanned economic censorship where 
the artist cannot afford to create as he 
wishes or the public cannot afford to 
become acquainted with his work, and 
the planned censorship of authority. 
Economically the freedom of art is best 
attained if there is as great a variety of 
publishers, booksellers, libraries, galleries, 
etc. as possible and if some, but not all, 
of these are large-scale organizations. 
* “The Thurber husband” refers to several weak and 
harried male characters who figure in the work of 
the American writer and humorist James Thurber 
(1894-1961).

If there are too new agencies, above all, if 
there is a state monopoly, the variety of 
works distributed invariably declines even 
if there is no deliberate censorship. If all 
are on a small scale, costs are too high for 
some of the potential public. 
The obstacle on which liberalism has so 
often come to grief is the fact that we 
find it easier to respect the freedom of 
those to whom we are indifferent than 
the freedom of those we love. A parent or 
a government who believes something 
to be good or true knows well enough 
that it is possible for their children or their 
people to choose what, to them, is evil 
or false, and that, if the wrong choice is 
made, those they love will suffer and they 
themselves will suffer with them; further, 
they and those they love will no longer 
belong to the same community. 
However, to love one’s neighbour as 
oneself means precisely to be willing to 
let him make his own mistakes and suffer 
with him when he suffers for them, for 
no man can himself consciously wish 
not to be responsible for his thoughts 
and actions, at whatever cost. Every man 
knows for himself that right and duty are 
not identical, that he has a duty to choose 
the good, but a right to choose the evil, 
that, as Kafka says: “A man lies as little as 
he can when he lies as little as he can, not 
when he is given the smallest possible 
opportunity to lie”.
Authorities who are more concerned 
that their charges should do the right 
thing than that they should choose it are 
always tempted to look for a short cut. 
In the short run, a man in a passion acts 
quicker and more effectively than a man 
who has reached the reflective stage 
of desire. Usually therefore, authorities 
would like the artist to arouse in others a 
passion for the good instead of making 
them conscious of good and evil; they 
would turn him, if they could, into Plato’s 
Noble Liar. 
Art has hardly ever been censored for 
aesthetic reasons because artists have 
rarely been in authority, which is perhaps 
just as well. In my own daydream state, for 
example, people caught reading Shelley 
or listening to Brahms are sentenced to 
the salt mines, and the possession of a 
juke-box is a capital offence.
The usual reasons for censorship are 
two: either that the work is immoral, i.e., 
will incite the public to act immorally 
or illegally so that society ceases to 
function properly; or that it is heretical, 
i.e., will induce the public to adopt other 
values than those held by the authorities, 
causing them to desert the latter’s 
community for a new one. Censorship 
always implies two things: that there is 
a potential public for the work and that 
its members are incapable of making a 
responsible choice. It is therefore only 
permissible under two conditions: for 
minors who are legally presumed to be as 
yet incapable of responsible choice; and 
for adults who have chosen their censor 
and are free to disregard him if they cease 
to believe in his authority.  
The Parthenon of Books, an installation by 
Argentinian artist Marta Minujín, presented 
at Documenta 14, at Kassel, Germany, 
in 2017. Made with books that were 
formerly or are currently banned in some 
countries, this monumental replica of the 
Parthenon takes a stand against censorship.

The Roman Catholic Church, for 
example, does not violate the freedom 
of its members by putting books on the 
index, because no one is obliged to be 
a Roman Catholic and to choose to be 
one necessarily implies believing in the 
authority of the Church to decide what 
the faithful may read. 
No State has such a right because one 
becomes a member of a political society 
by being born, an act of chance, not 
a choice. 
Revolutions and 
human freedom
Each major revolution in history is 
concerned with some particular aspect of 
human freedom, and has its representative 
human type. Each establishes its kind of 
freedom once and for all. 
The success of each is threatened by its 
own false claim to be the revolution, i.e., 
that the aspect of freedom with which 
it is concerned is the only freedom 
that matters. 
Since the particular aspect with which 
any revolution is concerned is one 
conspicuously ignored by the revolution 
before it, it is apt in its just criticism of the 
latter’s failing to be hostile to the freedom 
for which it fought. Nevertheless the fates 
of all revolutions are bound up with each 
other; they stand or fall together: if the 
preceding revolution had not won its battle, 
its successor could not be fighting its own. 
In any revolution, therefore, the gains of the 
revolutions before it have to be defended if 
the present revolution is to succeed. 
The Papal Revolution of the eleventh 
and the twelfth centuries established 
the freedom of an individual to choose 
between loyalties, his right to leave one 
community and join another, his right 
to belong to two communities at the 
same time.  
Its typical figures are the contemplative 
international priest and the activist 
local soldier.
The revolution of the Reformation in 
the sixteenth century established the 
freedom of the individual to choose 
his career, his right to leave the society 
to which his father belonged and 
join another. Its typical figure is the 
professional man. 
The French and Industrial Revolutions of 
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
established the freedom of the individual 
man of talent to develop himself freely 
and compete for public attention, the 
right of the individual mind to change 
the community or lead a society if he 
can. The typical figure is Figaro. L’esprit 
seul peut tout changer. / De vingt rois que 
l’on encense / Le trépas brise l’autel / Et 
Voltaire est immortel. (Only wit can make 
a difference. / Out of twenty kings who 
wear a crown / Death breaks the altar, / 
But Voltaire is immortal.).

One of the world crowd
Our revolution of the twentieth century 
is trying to establish the freedom of 
the individual body to determine its 
satisfactions, to grow and be healthy. 
Its typical figure is the anonymous 
naked man with a dog-tag number, 
not yet a member of any society or 
any community, but simply one of the 
world crowd. 
Hence the preoccupation of our time with 
medicine and economics, its activism, 
its hostility to the achievement of the 
French Revolution, freedom of speech 
and thought, which it sees as a threat to 
unanimous action. At the physical level 
all are really equal in their needs and 
individual differences of temperament or 
talent are irrelevant. 
In our revolution, therefore, focused on 
winning freedom from physical want**, 
all the freedoms gained by preceding 
revolutions are threatened as never 
before. The French Revolution is denied 
wherever there is a controlled press 
and a censorship of art and science; 
the Reformation is denied wherever a 
state dictates what career an individual 
citizen shall follow; the Papal Revolution 
is denied wherever a monolithic state 
claims unconditional authority. 
The talented individual today is being 
punished for the airs he gave himself in 
the past two centuries. Poets are not the 
unacknowledged legislators of the world 
and never were and it is a good thing that 
they should be made to realize this. Those 
who preached a doctrine of Art for Art’s 
sake or Art as a luxury were much nearer 
the truth, but they should not then have 
regarded the comparative frivolity of 
their vocation as a proof of their spiritual 
superiority to the useful untalented 
worker. In actual fact, the modern censor 
and the romantic artist are alike in 
thinking art more important than it is. 
What role for the poet?
“Once he looked rosy, now he looks 
blue. / Nurse is wondering What shall I 
do?” sings the poet in the sick room. If 
patient or nurse were to say to him “For 
God’s sake, stop humming and fetch 
some hot water and bandages” it would 
be one thing. But neither says this. The 
nurse says: “Tell the patient I am the only 
one who can cure him and I will give 
you a passport, extra ration cards, and 
free tickets to the opera. If you tell him 
anything else, I shall call the police”. And 
the poor delirious patient cries: “Persuade 
me that I am looking and feeling fine and 
I will give you a duplex apartment and 
a beautiful mistress. If you can’t do that, 
I shan’t listen to you”. 
Perhaps the poet, if he really loved the 
patient and the nurse as himself, would 
be silent and fetch the hot water, but as 
long as he continues singing, there is 
one commandment which his song must 
obey, “Thou shalt not bear false witness 
against thy neighbour”.
English-American poet, playwright, critic, 
and librettist, W. H. Auden (1907-1973) 
was one of the leading literary figures 
of the twentieth century. He emigrated 
to the United States in 1939, where he 
taught at several universities and took 
US citizenship in 1946.

**Freedom from want was the primary objective that 
needed to be addressed if Britain’s major social and 
economic challenges were to be resolved, according 
to the British economist and reformer William 
Beveridge. The 1942 Beveridge report paved the way 
for the British welfare state; a series of reforms were 
introduced by Clement Attlee's Labour government 
in the years after the Second World War.

The third “c” raises the question 
whether human rights principles are 
operationalized on the ground, and 
made accessible to people whose rights 
are at stake. What does human rights 
mean to a person living in extreme and 
permanent poverty in Cairo, Karachi 
or Lagos − what difference has human 
rights made in their lives? 
What should the role of the state be in the 
protection of human rights? 
I find that the protection of rights 
anywhere happens at the level of civil 
rights, not at the level of human rights – 
in other words, protection is granted by 
the states to citizens and so-called “lawful 
residents,” never to human beings as such. 
Interview by Shiraz Sidhva
An expert on human rights in 
cross-cultural perspectives, 
An-Na’im has sought to 
reconcile his identity as a 
Sudanese Muslim with his 
staunch commitment to 
universal human rights. He 
argues that human rights 
should be people-centred, not 
state-centric. Explaining his 
controversial views, An-Naim 
says that he expects opposition 
to his ideas. “If I’m not resisted, 
I’m not relevant,” he insists. 
When you refer to the three “Cs” of human 
rights, what exactly do you mean? 
I sometimes speak in terms of the three 
“Cs” of human rights − the concept, the 
content and the context. 
The concept is universality, as we talk 
about human rights as the rights of the 
human, but do we really mean that? Are 
we really capable of protecting the rights 
of the human as such? Which state does 
that? Sadly, the truth is to the contrary − 
human rights rhetoric is used by states as 
a weapon to demonize each other in their 
power politics, instead of being universal 
principles of public policy to protect the 
dignity of all human beings. 
The second “c” refers to what these 
rights are, and here we must admit 
that it is a work in progress rather than 
already implemented as public policy on 
the ground.

That is why refugees and migrant 
workers, for instance, do not enjoy 
protection of their human rights as 
proclaimed by the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (UDHR). Even the 
rights of citizens and lawful residents are 
determined by the state every step of the 
way. It is always states which decide to 
negotiate treaties with other states, ratify 
or ignore relevant international treaties, 
and determine the manner and scope 
of protection of the rights of any person 
subject to their jurisdiction. 
The entire human rights field is under 
the authority of state sovereignty. Global 
international law does not pretend 
to force any state to do anything. The 
United Nations and all other international 
organizations are constituted and 
governed by states, they can only do 
what states permit them to do, and in 
the scope and manner authorized by 
the states.

In Sudan, the British amended the Penal 
Code to make FGM punishable by two 
years’ imprisonment in 1946, the year 
I was born. I am now 72, and FGM still 
exists, for more than ninety per cent 
of the population. To my knowledge, 
there has not been a single prosecution. 
“Honour” killing is a similar problem. 
These are clear areas where we have to 
have transformation. 
What is the best way to bring 
about change? 
We need to go beyond bureaucratic, 
formulistic ideas − to inspire the 
imagination of people, and to 
drive change. 
Sometimes people don’t try to bring 
about change because they don’t think 
it’s possible. But they are wrong. See how 
transformative thinking has worked in 
the gay rights movement, for example, 
within a short span of twenty years. 
When I moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in the 
United States, in 1995, sodomy was a 
crime for which you were sent to prison. 
In 2015, it became a constitutional right 
for same-sex couples to marry.
When you think of the speed by which 
this transformation happened, it shows 
that you don’t have to start with legal 
change. In fact, if you start with cultural 
and social change, the transformation in 
a community is really the driving force of 
change – not the consequence of change. 
When you refer to the culture of human 
rights, which can be promoted through 
internal discourse and cross-cultural 
dialogue, what do you mean? 
By human rights culture, I am referring 
to internalized values − since early 
socialization of children − which are 
reinforced throughout our lives. These 
values tend to support respect for and 
protection of the human rights of others, 
though they may not be identified in 
these terms. 
All this may be appropriate for the 
present state of human development, 
but these principles are not good for the 
protection of human rights. That is why I 
speak of the paradox of self-regulation by 
states, in contradistinction to entrenched 
fundamental rights which are supposed 
to be beyond control and manipulation 
by the state. 
But then, how do we ensure respect 
for human rights?  
I do not mean that we don’t need human 
rights, or that their protection cannot be 
realized in practice. The point I do wish 
to emphasize is that we must be clear on 
where human rights come from and in 
which manner − including questions such 
as how these rights are defined and how 
they are operationalized. 
In my view, human rights should be 
defined by the people who accept 
and live by them on the ground, 
and not imposed by former colonial 
powers on their former colonies or by 
delegates of post-colonial states, and 
international bureaucrats. 
Second, human rights norms must be 
implemented through realistic contextual 
steps that are suited to the needs and 
resources of relevant communities, 
and not by enacting high-sounding 
legislation to be presented at sanitized 
meetings of international organizations, 
and diplomatic or academic conferences. 
Third, strategies of implementation must 
be deeply contextual, and under the 
control of the human subjects of these 
rights everywhere. 
Could you give us an example of this? 
If I want to combat female genital 
mutilation (FGM) in Sudan, for example, 
I can’t do it by having a declaration 
issued in Geneva. I can’t do it by even 
Sudan issuing a statute. But I can do it by 
changing attitudes in the communities. 
That is the key.

Within human beings, and among 
their communities, there are impulses 
for respecting the dignity of the 
other, and also striving for inter-
communal harmony, co-existence and 
mutual interdependence. 
All these are human rights values, in my 
view, though they are not represented 
as such in common discourse. I have 
argued since the 1980s for cultivating 
the culture of human rights for each 
community, as the basis of deepening 
and expanding international consensus 
within cultures, and by dialogue among 
different cultures. The 1992 book Human 
Rights in Cross-Cultural Perspectives: 
A Quest for Consensus, which I edited, 
expands on this.
On a more personal level, how did you 
start taking an interest in human rights 
from an Islamic perspective? 
As I struggled with my own conflicting 
belief in Islam and opposition to Sharia 
in the 1960s, I was fortunate enough 
to encounter Ustadh (revered teacher) 
Mahmoud Mohamed Taha. It was his 
innovative interpretation of Islam 
which helped me reconcile my belief in 
Islam and commitment to upholding 
human rights. 
Ustadh Taha was a Sudanese engineer by 
profession, and a Muslim Sufi reformer 
by religious orientation. He participated 
in the struggle for independence in 
Sudan of the 1940s, and was a political 
prisoner under the Anglo-Egyptian 
colonial administration of Sudan. He 
was the founder and president of the 
Republican Party, which agitated for 
independence of Sudan as a democratic 
Republic, hence the name. After an 
extended period of imprisonment, 
continued into a period of religious 
discipline, Ustadh Taha emerged in 1951 
with a reformist interpretation of Islam. 
Following his tragic execution in January 
1985, and the suppression of his reform 
movement in Sudan, I left my home 
country but continued to develop my 
own understanding and application of 
the reform methodology of my teacher, 
and striving to live by his model. 
Tell us about your “Future of Sharia 
project”.
My current “Future of Sharia” project 
combines several themes of my 
academic work and advocacy for social 
change, as these elements have evolved 
in my thinking since my law student 
days in the 1960s to the present time. 
In terms of Islamic reform and 
scholarship, I have managed to reconcile 
my commitment to a secular state from 
an Islamic perspective, as I have done 
regarding human rights earlier, with 
my religion. 
Through my website/blog, I have called 
for a global public debate on the ideas 
based on my 2008 book, Islam and the 
Secular State. 
I am convinced that ideas of human 
rights and citizenship are more 
consistent with Islamic principles than 
with claims of a supposedly Islamic state 
to enforce Sharia. In the book, I present 
Islamic arguments for the separation of 
Islam and the state, while regulating the 
relationship between Islam and politics. 
I argue that the coercive enforcement 
of Sharia by the state betrays the 
Koran’s insistence on the voluntary 
acceptance of Islam. Individual piety can 
be reconciled with collective religious 
identity – in order to be a Muslim by 
conviction and free choice, which is 
the only way one can be a Muslim, I 
need a secular state, one that is neutral 
regarding religious doctrine, and 
promotes genuine religious observance.

Added to this idyllic image is the family 
tradition that Tumanyan’s ancestors 
belonged to the great princely family 
of the Mamikonian dynasty, who for 
centuries had served as chief generals 
of Armenian armies. A family fiction or 
mythified story, the writer believed in it – 
even if his genealogical research did not 
quite produce the desired result. 
From childhood, the future poet was 
immersed in the wonderful world of tales 
and legends, transmitted by his father 
– himself surrounded by a double aura, 
both sacred and profane. We understand 
that telling stories will become for 
Tumanyan, a way of thinking and of 
transmitting ancestral and folk material.
Hovhannes
Tumanyan
A passion for storytelling 
Krikor Beledian
It has been nearly a century 
since Hovhannes Tumanyan 
lived, but his poems have lost 
none of their originality, their 
emotional charge, or their 
ability to stimulate reflection. 
Using the form of narrative 
poems in rhyming verse almost 
exclusively, the writer forged 
his own style in the early 1900s, 
drawing inspiration from the 
Armenian oral tradition. His work 
inspired two operas – Anoush by 
Armen Tigranyan and Almast by 
Alexander Spendiaryan. 
With this article, the Courier joins 
UNESCO in the celebration of the 
150th anniversary of the birth of 
Hovhannes Tumanyan, and of World 
Poetry Day on 21 March.
Hovhannes Tumanyan 
in the 1910s.
Evoking his childhood in his 
autobiography, Hovhannes Tumanyan 
(1869-1923) presents his father, Ter 
Matheos, not just as a priest of the 
Armenian church – who sang the usual 
repertoire of liturgical songs – but also 
as a bard who recited epic poems, 
accompanying himself on a tchonkour, 
a popular plucked-string instrument. It is 
in this familiar setting that the source of 
the fascination for narrative poetry in the 
child’s imagination should be sought. 
As for the image of his mother, Sona, it 
evokes in the child the somewhat wild 
alpine landscape of Dsegh, his native 
village. “My mother was born and raised 
in the mountains, she was a daughter of 
the mountains,” the poet who gave us the 
beautiful verses on the steep mountains 
of Armenia, would later write at the end 
of this portrait.

Discovering other 
literary worlds
Born in February 1869 in Dsegh, a village 
in Lori province, in the north of what is 
today Armenia, the young Hovhannes 
had to leave this primordial Eden – first 
to study in Stepanavan, about forty 
kilometres from his village, and then in 
Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. He would 
spend most of his life in this great cultural 
centre for all Transcaucasia (made up of 
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia).
The death of his father prevented 
Tumanyan from completing his formal 
education at the Nersessian high school, 
one of the country’s best schools at the 
time. Obliged to support his family, he 
began working as a secretary at the 
bishopric of the local Armenian church 
in 1887. But, stifled by the restrictive 
atmosphere there, he left the post. He 
then worked at odd jobs, struggling to 
support his growing family – because 
in the meanwhile, the young man had 
married and fathered ten children. 
An enlightened self-taught man, this 
avid reader plunged into both Armenian 
and foreign culture. He read poets who 
were Russian (Lermontov, Pushkin), 
German (Goethe), English (Byron, Milton, 
Shakespeare), American (Longfellow) 
and many others – translating and 
“Armenianizing” them. He absorbed both 
Western and Eastern folklore. 
At the Tumanyan House-Museum in 
Yerevan, the Armenian capital – where 
his library and some of his manuscripts 
are preserved today – we can measure 
the extent of his reading, and consult 
some of the documentation that the poet 
considered essential for the composition 
of his poems and prose narratives.
Reading Pushkin is likely to have 
reinforced his ideas on the formal 
elaboration of narrative, while it was 
probably Shakespeare’s “ghost” that 
dissuaded him from publishing his plays, 
which he eventually destroyed. Apart 
from this indirect influence, foreign 
literature appears very little in his own 
texts. They represent “reading contacts” 
that were essential to the development 
of a poet whose immediate environment 
offered few innovative literary models.
A performance of Armen Tigranyan's 
opera Anouch at the Théâtre  
Nanterre-Amandiers, France, in 2013.
The right word
Tumanyan’s first collection, Poems, 
published in Moscow in 1890, was a great 
success with literary critics. Subsequently, 
all his collections would have the same 
generic title, with the exception of 
Harmonies, published in Tbilisi in 1896. 
Each volume included a number of 
previously published poems, to which 
new ones were added.
Following this lyrical interlude of the 
years 1890 to 1896, a completely new 
tone can be heard in his narrative poems 
– that cannot easily be classified into any 
established literary genre. A narrative 
that is versified, rhymed and structured 
in episodes – this is the common 
denominator of his new literary pieces, 
in which the author revisits famous 
Armenian or Caucasian fables, legends 
and tales, reworking them with a clearly 
allegorical aim.

The age of literary 
maturity
It was at the very beginning of the 
twentieth century that Tumanyan 
achieved perfect mastery of the poetic 
narrative in verse, notably in Anoush and 
The Siege of Tmouk Castle. A pastoral epic 
set in idyllic Lori, Anoush is composed 
of six songs, beginning with a prelude. 
This story of thwarted love, with all the 
ingredients of a tragedy in verse, inspired 
Armen Tigranyan (1879-1950) to write 
his eponymous opera, which is still 
performed around the world today.
The Siege of Tmouk Castle recounts an 
episode in eighteenth-century Armenian 
history, in which Princess Almast, 
enticed by the false promises of the 
Persian king, Nadir Shah, betrays her 
husband, Prince Tatul, and delivers the 
fortress to the enemy. After destroying 
everything, the conqueror turns against 
the traitor and has her beheaded. 
The political significance of this poem 
is much more explicit than that of 
Anoush. It inspired Almast, the opera by 
Alexander Spendiaryan (1871-1928). 
Today, bronze statues of the poet and the 
composer stand in the foreground of the 
Yerevan Opera, a highly symbolic site in 
the Armenian capital. They remind us that 
the stories immortalized by them are still 
relevant today.
Around the same time, Tumanyan 
began writing the folk epic, David of 
Sassoon, of which he would publish only 
a fragment. In it, he revisited a famous 
work of the Armenian literary tradition, to 
convey messages that were close to his 
heart – mutual respect among peoples, 
rejection of violence, and the rejection of 
all oppression.
Poet and man of action
This work remained unfinished, as did 
his poem The Firebird, because his public 
activities took up more and more of his 
time. Because, alongside the poet, there 
was in Tumanyan a real man of action, 
who had always refused to be a mere 
literary figure – even when he created 
the literary circle, Vernatun (the upper 
chamber), in his own home, with a 
group of writer friends, including Avetis 
Aharonian, Alexander Shirvanzade, 
Avetik Issahakian and Nikol Aghbalian.
Substantially different from the many 
literary and artistic salons of Tbilisi, 
Vernatun’s main objective was to offer 
writers – including those passing 
through the city – a place to meet and 
exchange ideas.  ©

When Tumanyan writes The Dog and the 
Cat, The Unlucky Merchants, The Convent 
of the Dove – or other tales that every 
Armenian has known by heart since 
childhood – his inventiveness lies less 
in the material used than in the way the 
action is staged. This action corresponds 
perfectly to an underlying idea, unveiled 
only at the end of the story. The narrative 
involves animals or humans in an 
ongoing plot with cleverly orchestrated 
twists culminating in a climax. The central 
message is expressed at the end, in one 
or two succinct phrases.
This literary technique, unique to 
Tumanyan, makes him an outstanding 
storyteller, who masterfully commands 
verse and word. It is the result of hard 
work, traces of which can be found in 
a multitude of drafts and successive 
versions of the texts. The poet often 
rewrites even texts that have already 
been published, transforming them in 
depth with the obvious aim of achieving 
as simple and effective an expression 
possible. In contrast to many of his 
colleagues who favoured being more 
prolific, Tumanyan used understatement, 
allusion, the right word, and in the literal 
sense, a true poetic method.
Pursuing the same goal, Tumanyan also 
founded an association of Armenian 
writers from the Caucasus. It remained 
the epicentre of Armenian literature until 
the October Revolution of 1917. 
Tumanyan exhibited the same enthusiasm 
when he was involved in politics. During 
the Armenian-Tatar conflict in 1905, he 
played the role of negotiator between the 
parties and succeeded in preventing the 
hostilities from spreading to Lori province. 
He tried to do the same during the short 
Armenian-Georgian war in 1919, when 
the first symptoms of the evil that would 
prevail in March 1923 appeared. This 
activism led him to be arrested twice, in 
1908 and 1911.
During the genocide of 1915, he 
organized relief efforts for Armenian 
refugees fleeing the devastated towns 
and villages. This painful experience is at 
the heart of two of his finest poems, ‘Rest 
in Peace’ and ‘With My Fatherland’– which 
have the merit of being free of both 
pathos and resentment, so widespread at 
that time in this kind of literature.
If it is true that “the poet is first and 
foremost the heart of his people”, as 
Tumanyan wrote, it is also true that the 
Armenian people will always carry his 
immortal poems in their hearts. Many 
years after the poet’s death, we still hear 
his voice echoing in the steep mountains 
of our country:
The way was heavy and the night was dark,  
And yet we survived  
Both sorrow and gloom.  
Through the ages we go and gaze at the stark 
Steep heights of our land – 
The Armenian Highlands […] 
And we gaze with dolorous, longing eyes  
At the earth in its gloom,  
At the distant stars; 
Ah, when will the dawn break at last 
Over our green 
Armenian Highlands? 
A French poet and novelist of Armenian 
origin, Krikor Beledian was born in 
Beirut, Lebanon, and has lived in Paris 
since 1967. He is the author of numerous 
collections of poems and essays, and 
a series of autobiographical stories in 
Western Armenian. His work has been 
published in Armenia, France, Lebanon 
and the United States.

In Ancient Greece, in the fifth century 
B.C., seeds of spices, corn and grains 
were planted in terracotta or basketwork 
containers. Called Gardens of Adonis, they 
were germinated to honour the mortal 
lover of the goddess of love, Aphrodite 
during the festival of Adonis, held in mid-
July every year.
In contrast, there is no mention of ritual 
sprouts in the Avesta, or in Persian 
writings on Nowruz. Nor are sprouts a 
part of the rituals observed by the Parsis, 
the followers of the Zoroastrian religion 
who fled from Persia in successive waves 
to India between the seventh and tenth 
centuries, following the Arab conquests 
of their country. 
Yet the custom of sprouted seeds 
endures, as the centrepiece of the haft 
sin table, around which some 300 million 
people across the world gather each 
spring to celebrate Nowruz.
The sprouts tradition might have spread 
from South India, where they are still 
used in ceremonies. According to the 
French ethnologist Louis Dumont, 
women belonging to the Piramalai 
Kallar community in Tamil Nadu, who 
want to fulfil their vows, balance pots 
on their heads – filled with various 
items, including sprouts obtained by 
“germinating seven or nine seeds in a 
container in the dark for a week.”
In the belief systems of all the world’s 
peoples, as time completes its annual 
cycle, there is a great risk that humankind 
will perish. They believe that performing 
rituals will allow them to go beyond 
this cycle. The New Year festivals, often 
celebrated to usher in spring, herald the 
rebirth of nature. 
Nowruz, which literally means “new day”, 
is one of these. Its origins, which date 
back at least two thousand years, are 
unclear, but the tradition is alive and well 
and celebrated in all the countries that 
were once part of the Persian Empire. 
In Iran, the centre of ancient Persia, 
preparations begin two or three weeks 
before Nowruz. Women begin to “shake” 
their houses – performing a massive 
spring cleaning. On the Tuesday before 
the festival, the men organize games 
which involve jumping over fires. 
Meanwhile, children put on masks 
and go from house to house in small 
groups, knocking on doors, hoping to 
receive cakes or coins. This tradition is 
reminiscent of Halloween, a holiday now 
associated with All Saints’ Day in the 
English-speaking and Celtic worlds; and 
Koliada, a Slavic winter solstice festival, 
which has, over the years, become part of 
Christmas celebrations. 
Going back to Iran: when the day of the 
vernal equinox dawns, the beginning 
of the festivities is announced by the 
sounds of the drum of Haji Firouz, a kind 
of king’s jester with a blackened face. 
Nowruz:
The seeds of a new day
Salvatore D’Onofrio
From the cult of the vegetation god Osiris in ancient Egypt to the 
summer solstice celebrations in Sardinia, Italy, to the Maronite feast 
of Eid el Burbara in Lebanon and the ceremonies of the Piramalai 
Kallar in Tamil Nadu, India, the symbol of the sprouted seed plays 
a central role in many rituals. Wheat, barley, or lentil sprouts are 
also at the heart of Nowruz – the New Year of the peoples who were 
once part of the Persian Empire – celebrated each spring by around 
300 million people worldwide. But why are the shoots thrown 
into the water? 
Every home – including Iranian 
households in the diaspora – sets up 
a table with haft sin, or seven items, all 
beginning with the letter ‘s’ (sin). They are 
the sabzeh (sprouts of wheat, oats, lentils 
and other seeds), sir (garlic), sib (apple), 
summak (sumac), senjed (the jujube fruit), 
serkeh (vinegar) and samanu (a wheat 
pudding made by slow-cooking ground 
wheat sprouts).
Sometimes a mirror (aine), cakes or coins 
are added. The Koran may also be placed 
on the table (having replaced the Avesta, 
the sacred book of the Zoroastrians), 
and even some poetry. For example, 
The Divan of Hafez, by the Persian mystic 
poet famous for memorizing the Koran, 
is often used for divination.
The family meal includes fish and rice, 
but the centrepiece of the table is always 
the sabzeh. The seeds have been sown 
by women, on plates inside the house 
at the beginning of the festivities, and 
constantly watered so the young green 
shoots are ready on Nowruz. 
Why these shoots? 
The origins of the sprout ritual are difficult 
to determine. The oldest references go 
back to the Germinating Beds of Osiris of 
Ptolemaic Egypt – a tradition in which soil 
was moulded into the shape of figurines, 
representing the god of the dead and 
resurrection to eternal life. The pottery 
bricks, made of earth kneaded with water 
and barley grains, were placed in tombs 
in a reclining position. 
Nauryz, Navruz, Nawrouz, Nevruz, Nooruz, 
Novruz, Nowrouz, Nowruz! So many 
ways of writing the same word for this 
new year and spring festival celebrated 
notably in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, 
India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan 
and Uzbekistan. In 2009, the festival was 
inscribed on UNESCO’s Representative 
List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage 
of Humanity, before this inscription was 
extended to new countries in 2016. 
Since 2010, 21 March is celebrated as 
the International Day of Nowruz.

In the Judeo-Christian 
tradition 
In Europe too, the new shoots are central 
to various festivals. In Provence, France, 
on 4 December, Saint Barbara’s Day, it is 
the custom to germinate wheat grains 
from the previous harvest in three cups 
and to place them on the table of the 
“grand supper” on the twenty-fourth. 
They are then placed in the crib of 
the Nativity scene. The same tradition 
exists in Lebanon among the Maronite 
Christians of Arab ethnicity, and in 
Sicily, Italy, among the inhabitants of 
Castelbuono in Palermo.
On 19 March, Sicilians also decorate Saint 
Joseph’s Table with shoots, along with up to 
101 delicacies. This is to celebrate both the 
virtues of poverty, represented by the saint, 
and those of wealth, represented by the 
wheat – in particular by the bread, baked 
for the occasion using elaborate recipes. 
In southern Italy, on the Holy Thursday 
before Easter, shoots are placed on the altar 
in the oratory where, according to Catholic 
liturgy, the Eucharist is kept. Meanwhile, 
the Jewish community in Rome maintains 
a ritual custom of shoots that dates back 
to the Middle Ages, during the festivals of 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
Our European tour ends on 21 June, the 
summer solstice, in the small town of 
Bari Sardo in Sardinia, Italy. Here we can 
witness a procession of women carrying 
nenniri, or shoots, on their heads in 
containers – topped by an impressive 
cane structure, decorated with delicately-
shaped breads and seasonal fruit. The 
women walk through the streets to the 
sea, into which they throw their nenniri.
The thirteenth day
In South India, too, the Kallar women 
form a procession, carrying shoots on 
their heads. They end their ceremonial 
journey by dancing around the shoots 
before flinging them into the water.
In Ancient Greece, the Gardens of Adonis 
were also consigned to the water, in 
fountains or the sea, after being carried 
over roof terraces – just as Mazdaean 
Iranians still do today in Yazd, and 
elsewhere in Iran.
In Iran, on the thirteenth day after Nowruz, 
everyone spends the day outdoors – eating, 
playing, singing and performing the final 
ritual: throwing the shoots into running 
water. But not before the girls have braided 
a few strands of the shoots, making a wish 
to find a husband in the coming year. 
Nowruz is one of those celebrations that 
bring together societies that are distant 
from each other, both in space and time 
– the periodic return of vegetation is seen 
as a symbol of a new beginning of life. 
But while their germination symbolizes a 
renewal, the seeds also carry within them, 
all the troubles of the year that is ending. 
This ambivalent nature of the shoots 
makes it necessary to get rid of them, 
letting the waters carry our ills far away 
from us.

The world’s freshwater environment is 
facing unprecedented pressures in the 
twenty-first century. A growing global 
population and economic development 
have led to increasing demands on 
water resources. The overuse of water 
is widespread; consequences include 
reducing river flows, the loss of lakes and 
wetlands and falling ground-water levels. 
The most dramatic example of this is the 
loss of the Aral Sea in Central Asia, which 
used to be the fourth-largest saltwater 
lake in the world, but has become a 
desert in forty years, shrinking to barely 
ten per cent of its original size due to 
upstream water withdrawals. 
More generally, human impacts on 
natural systems are so extensive that the 
term Anthropocene has been used to 
describe the current geological epoch 
[see Welcome to the Anthropocene, 
Courier, April-June 2018]. The increasing 
pressures on water resources are set 
against this backdrop of extensive 
anthropogenic change. 
Urbanization (more than half of the 
world’s population now lives in cities), 
deforestation and the extension of 
cultivated land (1.5 billion hectares 
worldwide) have had a significant impact 
on hydrology and water quality. 
Delivering water
security in a changing world
Howard S. Wheater
Eighty per cent of the world’s population is exposed to high levels 
of threats to water security and a severe water crisis is looming by 
2070. Faced with these alarming estimates, the author argues that 
a business-as-usual attitude will not work. Water management is 
a scientific issue, but it is also a matter of politics, governance and 
societal values. A new transdisciplinary science is urgently needed. 
With this article, the Courier marks 
the celebration of World Water Day 
on 22 March. 
Work from the series Find a way or 
make one, by the Swiss-Russian 
photographer Anastasia Mityukova, 
made using only materials 
she could find at home:  
old photos, webcams, books, 
newspapers and ice.
Threats on a global 
scale
Nearly eighty per cent of the world’s 
population is exposed to high levels of 
water security threats. Urban areas and 
agriculture are important sources of 
water pollution, threatening aquatic life 
and increasing pressures on freshwater 
ecosystems. In 2010, experts estimated 
that 10,000 to 20,000 freshwater species 
were extinct or at risk.
Inevitably, pressures on the hydrological 
environment to meet the food and 
energy needs of a growing global human 
population will only increase. Food 
production will have to rise by seventy 
per cent by 2050 to meet projected 
demand, according to a 2012 estimate of 
the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the United Nations (FAO). 
A 2013 study on water scarcity published 
in the Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 
(HESS) monthly concluded that about half 
of the world’s population will experience 
severe water stress between 2071 and 
2100.
The changes wrought by human actions 
to the environment have also increased 
water-related risks to life, property 
and infrastructure associated with 
extreme events. This was illustrated by 
the 2017 flooding of Houston, Texas, in 
the United States.

In an area where development had 
proceeded in spite of known flood risk, 
300,000 structures were inundated, 
causing the evacuation of hundreds of 
thousands of people, with flood damage 
estimated to exceed $125 billion.
In an increasingly interconnected world, 
the impact of floods and droughts is not 
limited to local consequences. The 2011 
flooding in Thailand caused economic 
losses estimated at $46.5 billion by the 
World Bank, due to the disruption of 
global electronics supply chains. And 
the heat wave in Russia in 2010, which 
affected wheat production and global 
food prices, was said to be a factor in the 
social unrest associated with the Arab 
Spring, The Economist reported in 2012.
Recent global warming has led to 
profound changes in the hydrological 
environment. The glaciers in the Canadian 
Rocky Mountains, for example, are rapidly 
retreating. They are expected to be 
largely lost by the end of the century – yet 
they feed major rivers draining into the 
Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic oceans.

The engagement of all 
stakeholders is a necessity, 
not an option 
The forests in western Canada are also 
receding, largely because they have 
been infested by bark beetles, whose 
proliferation is associated, in part, 
with warmer winters. While Western 
Canada is a regional example, it is worth 
noting that half the world’s population 
depends on water from cold regions, 
where warming can be expected to have 
similarly severe effects.

A study published in the journal Climatic 
Change in February 2016 states that by 
2050, between 0.5 billion and 3.1 billion 
people will be exposed to an increase in 
water scarcity caused by climate change.
New strategies
How can the water science community 
best respond, to provide the 
understanding and decision-support 
tools needed to address these 
challenges? Incremental science, inching 
forward in small steps, is not up to the 
task, and a business-as-usual attitude 
cannot be tolerated. A more holistic 
scope, on a global scale, and strategic 
focus is needed. 
Firstly, there is an increasing need 
for better scientific understanding of 
the water environment in the face of 
unprecedented environmental and 
societal change. These issues cut across 
disciplinary boundaries. For example, 
to predict future river flows in western 
Canada requires an understanding of 
how ecosystems and agriculture will 
respond to climate change. 
In turn, the prediction of future climate 
depends on understanding the changes 
in land-atmosphere feedbacks – such as 
the greening of the shrub tundra in the 
North, or the proliferation of vegetation, 
especially shrubs, that will absorb more 
and more solar energy, thus contributing 
to global warming.
The new research paradigm should 
include a thorough knowledge of the 
social processes that accompany the 
effective – and reciprocal – engagement of 
science and policy. 
It is crucial to recognize that local 
stakeholders are an important source of 
knowledge. Indigenous communities, 
for example, have a wealth of multi-
generational knowledge of their land and 
its interactions with natural forces [see 
the Wide Angle section of this issue]. This 
knowledge must be used for the benefit 
of science. That is why – as part of the 
Global Water Futures (GWF) programme 
in Canada – we launched a project with 
Canada’s Aboriginal peoples in April 2018, 
to work together on a research strategy 
that can help solve the water problems 
facing these communities. 
Ultimately, the major challenges of 
water security lie with governance. The 
question of who has the power to make 
decisions (and how these decisions are 
made) is therefore crucial.
If the scientific understanding and 
prediction of water changes pose 
significant scientific challenges, so does 
water management. Water security in the 
twenty-first century is both a scientific 
and a social issue. Therefore, a new 
transdisciplinary approach is needed that 
will establish links between the natural 
and social sciences. 
To summarize: to prevent a major water 
crisis, we need to develop new scientific 
knowledge to understand the evolution 
of water systems that involve the 
relationship between man and nature; to 
establish new interdisciplinary modes of 
scientific collaboration to understand the 
interconnections of these systems and 
their societal implications; to integrate 
local knowledge into scientific research 
to address user needs; and to put in place 
more effective mechanisms to translate 
scientific knowledge into societal action.
Professor at the School of Environment 
and Sustainability at the University of 
Saskatchewan, Canada, and Emeritus 
professor of Hydrology at Imperial 
College, London, Howard S. Wheater 
(United Kingdom) has wide international 
experience of hydrology and water 
resources and is the author of 
seven books. 
The only certain thing about the future 
is that it will be highly uncertain, 
when it comes to climate and human 
socio-economic development – and 
interactions between the two. 
This uncertainty must be managed. Given 
the complexity of water systems and 
their interdependence with land, energy 
and food systems, at scales from local to 
global, managing uncertainty will require 
more adaptive and flexible strategies than 
those of the past. The past can no longer 
serve as a reliable guide to the future. 
We need to analyze vulnerability and 
adopt strategies that foster resilience – the 
ability of a system to absorb shock and 
continue to regenerate without changing 
to a new state. 
An interdisciplinary 
approach
It is widely recognized, for example, that 
there has been a disconnect between 
the science produced for climate 
impact assessment and long-term 
water planning or climate adaptation. 
In general, for science to be effective 
in delivering solutions, it must address 
problems that are deemed relevant to 
decision-makers, to deliver tools to users 
in a timely and useful format, and to 
include user input. The latter provides 
the credibility and legitimacy needed to 
resolve the politically contentious and 
socially significant issues that surround 
water resources management today.
This illustrates how important it is 
for scientists to recognize that the 
engagement of all stakeholders is a 
necessity, not an option.  
Enhancing the science-policy interface 
Ensuring access to water and sanitation for all is the sixth Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG 6) of the 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations 
in September 2015. 
As part of its action to achieve this Agenda, UNESCO organized the First Water 
Science-Policy Interface Colloquium (SPIC Water) on 14 June 2018, which brought 
together eleven ministers and parliamentarians, and other representatives of 
Member States and water experts.
The aim was to identify how the UNESCO International Hydrological Programme 
(IHP) could better assist countries to formulate a scientific, technological and 
capacity development agenda to accompany them in their endeavours. IHP is the 
only intergovernmental programme of the UN system devoted to water research, 
water resources management, and education and capacity building. 
This symposium is the first of a series to be held every two years as part of the 
IHP’s Intergovernmental Council sessions.
A holistic Water Conference is being organized at UNESCO in May 2019.

diverse societies observe and adapt to 
changing environments. A broad range of 
case studies illustrate how these societies 
– building upon traditional knowledge 
handed down through generations – are
