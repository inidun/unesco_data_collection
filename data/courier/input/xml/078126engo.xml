Over ío jo« . . . The vast continent ofAfrica, with a population today ofover 500 million, is experiencing a
development crisis. While science and technology play a vital role in helping to find a
solution, as this issue ofthe Unesco Courierpoints out, emphasis on the cultural dimension
ofpeople's lives is also fundamental in any effort to mobilize an entire continent. All the
means of self-expression available today must be used in order to broaden access to, and
participation in, cultural life. Above, ajournalist interviews a village woman in the Republic

This issue of the Unesco Courier offers a voyage of
discovery: scientific, geographic, historic, cultural,
artistic and humanitarian.
We have taken the life sciences as a point of
departure. Can any science be richer in potential
discoveries than contemporary biology? The ability to
explore the infinitely small, to isolate and study
genes, those units of hereditary information which are
basic to life, gives biology an often disturbing power
to investigate and intervene that places it in the
vanguard of modern science. Visions of the "outer
limits" of life are evoked for us by the noted biologist
Professor François Gros in his account of some of the
marvels emerging from the indefatigable laboratory
explorations of today's Marco Polos.
When the discovery of the Americas is referred to ,
especially in the Spanish-speaking countries, it brings
to mind the arrival of Europeans in the New World,
the fifth centenary of which will be commemorated in
four years' time . Is "discovery" the correct word to
use in describing this event? For Europeans there was
most certainly a discovery, but was it the same for the
peoples of the Americas, for those who were
"discovered"? As the Venezuelan writer Arturo
Uslar Pietri points out, 12 October 1492 in fact
marked the beginning of a pattern of universal
cultural exchanges and mutual influence, a process
which transformed the entire world and which is still
taking place today.
We also take a look at the young art of African
cinema, which may be a discovery for many readers,
whatever continent they come from. In the short
space of thirty years, African film-makers have
produced works which rank with the great classics of
world cinema.
Other discoveries to be made in the following pages
include the Convent of San Francisco, Lima, a
masterpiece of Spanish colonial art on which urgent
restoration work is currently being carried out; and
the superb mosques built more than four centuries
ago by the Turkish architectural genius, Mimar Sinan.
Finally, we draw attention to the urgent need to
display solidarity with Africa, whose plight is one of
Unesco's major preoccupations, in two articles which
analyse the development of science and technology in
that continent. A large proportion of the world's
population live in Africa, often in conditions of
extreme poverty, influenced by the effects of a serious
crisis that can only be overcome with the aid of a
science and technology policy fully adapted to
African needs.

The changing face of the
life sciences
~l
by François Gros
IN comparison with its antecedents, con¬
temporary biology presents a dramati¬
cally altered image to the world. Not
only is it in the process of revolutionizing
medicine, agriculture and the environmen¬
tal sciences, it is also calling in question,
through the epic adventure of modern gene¬
tics, the very nature of the species homo
sapiens. We are far from the poetic reveries
of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's botanizing
"Solitary Walker", or the attempts of
nineteenth-century comparatists to deter¬
mine the laws of evolution. Biology has
been transmuted into an exact, computer¬
ized, strangely disturbing science which has
spawned marketable technologies that are
profoundly modifying the industrial scene
and the balance between the industrialized
and the developing countries.
The decisive turning point was reached in
1973, the year which saw the birth of the
new and revolutionary discipline of genetic
engineering, which derived directly from
molecular biology. For the first time, the
general public became truly aware that the
life sciences existed and were capable of
exciting a degree of passionate concern riv¬
alling that aroused by nuclear physics.
Political and industrial decision-makers
were quick to recognize the birth of a mod¬
ern technology and to perceive the impor¬
tant practical consequences it could be ex¬
pected to have on the overall economic
equilibrium of the planet. From being pri¬
marily a "contemplative" science, biology
has become an active, manipulative
science, and even at times, unfortunately, a
target for speculators.
At this point I would like to give a few
examples of some of the most significant
achievements of contemporary biology.
Mapping the human genome
In addition to making it possible to con¬
trol at will the biosynthesizing capabilities
of unicellular organisms, genetic engineer¬
ing techniques have led to the development
of marker devices known as "genetic prob¬
es". It is now possible to envisage the use of
these probes to draw up an accurate map of
the human genetic make-up. Using recom-
binant-DNA technology1 (see the Unesco
Courier, March 1987), scientists have suc¬
ceeded in cloning2 fragments, varying in
size, of chromosomes taken from human or
animal cells within the cells of micro¬
organisms.
The micro-organisms propagate and am¬
plify these chromosome fragments which
can then be sorted and purified. Once they
are available in sufficient quantity to be
analysed, they can be subjected to two
further operations. The first of these,
known as physical mapping (or restriction-
enzyme mapping) consists of identifying the
fragments by studying the manner in which
they are cleaved by a battery of restriction
enzymes.3 The second, known as sequenc¬
ing, consists of determining their chemical
sequence, that is, the order in which their
constituent elements are linked together.
Before the advent of genetic engineering
the existence of genes could only be infer¬
red from the consequences of mutations of
which they are the site. Evidence for her¬
editary traits was found by studying change
in an eye pigment, in the morphology of a
limb, the behaviour of an animal, or in
susceptibility to a given disease. Once
tracked down, as it were, its site in the
chromosome was usually deduced from stu¬
dies of crossing based on the frequency of
liaison or segregation of characteristics dur¬
ing the recombination of parental chromo¬
somes. Finally, it was possible, under
favourable conditions, to reveal certain al¬
terations in chromosomes (splitting, trans¬
position, amplification) by observation us¬
ing optical or electronic microscopes.
Genetic engineering has made it possible
to "materialize" the gene. Representing
little more than a millionth part of man's
physical inheritance, the gene can hence¬
forth be isolated as a molecule; it has be¬
come, technically speaking, "workable".
Not only can it be analysed, it can also be
manipulated and, thanks to restriction en¬
zymes, be subjected to micro-surgery. In
short it can treated like any other molecule.
All this has had many consequences for
our fundamental understanding of life. It
has led, for example, to the discovery of the
genetic mechanisms responsible for the di¬
versity of antibodies, to precise study of
individual genetic polymorphism, and to
the discovery of cancer-bearing genes, or
"oncogenes". For the time being, however,
let us take a look at some of the medical
consequences, in particular the study of
hereditary diseases.
Locating defective genes
Every year in France, thousands of chil¬
dren are born suffering from serious here¬
ditary diseases. These afflictions, which
account for 50 per cent of infant mortality,
include muscular dystrophy, mental dis¬
orders, intolerances due to metabolic error,
mucoviscidosis (cystic fibrosis), blood dis¬
orders, X-chromosome fragility, serious
immuno-deficiency (an affected child may
have to be enclosed in a sterile "bubble").
But this is only the tip of the iceberg. In fact,
as the fund of genetic knowledge increases,
doctors and biologists are becoming aware
that, from birth, our genes bear within them
a number of risk factors and susceptibilities,
even when they are not subject to the se¬
rious mutations that are responsible for the
monogenic4 diseases. The French geneticist
Jean Dausset's discovery of genes whose
properties control compatibility or reaction
to organ or tissue grafts between individuals
has shown that certain mutations within
these genes increase considerably, some¬
times by a factor of over one thousand, the
predisposition to such serious illnesses as
ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatic fever and
auto-immune disease.
The ability to establish the chemical
sequences or physical organization of genes
opens up wide prospects for pre-natal or
pre-clinical diagnosis. Such early detection
was already possible by examination of the
karyotype or of enzymes, but these tests
were not very reliable and, above all, could
not be carried out until a relatively late
stage of foetal development. Diagnosis us¬
ing genetic probes, on the other hand, can
be made from the eleventh week. A dozen
or more serious illnesses can thus be de¬
tected and the nature of the mutation pin¬
pointed.
Moreover, this new field of genetics may
open the way to a grandiose project that has
aroused as much public interest in the Un¬
ited States of America as the problem of
AIDS. The proposed project involves
establishing the sequence of the 3,500 mil¬
lion chemical elements that make up the

complete genetic code enclosed within
man's forty-six chromosomes. The hope
would be that we would thus be in a position
to locate the very large number of muta¬
tions responsible for hereditary diseases
whose primary causes are as yet unknown.
Out of nearly 3,000 hereditary diseases that
have been described in the medical liter¬
ature, it has so far been possible to link no
more than a few dozen with any certainty to
a corresponding genetic mutation. Of the
100,000 to 150,000 human genes, barely
1,500 have been "located" and for only 500
of these has the chemical sequence been
established.
It is not our purpose here to enter into the
discussion as to whether there is sufficient
justification for such a project, which would
cost nearly 1,000 million dollars and occupy
hundreds of research wqrkers for from ten
to fifteen years. Yet the fact that it has been
proposed shows the extent to which the
recombinant-DNA technique has revolu¬
tionized genetics. Moreover, we have not as
yet mentioned its therapeutic possibilities.

It has been known for some five years now
that a foreign gene will function normally
when inserted into a somatic cell, such as
the lymph cell of human bone marrow.
Hence the idea of grafting "normal" genes
to compensate for defective genes by im¬
planting into a patient some of his own bone
marrow cells in which the "normal" gene
has already been inserted. Specialists be¬
lieve that it will soon be possible to envisage
the use of these "prosthetic genes", in par¬
ticular to save the lives of children suffering
from immuno-deficiency.
Oncogenes
Molecular biology and genetic engineer¬
ing have opened up a new approach to
human biology and medicine as they relate
to cancer. With the discovery only some
twelve years ago of a special category of
genes, the so-called "oncogenes", we are
now for the first time in a position to explain
the genetic origin of cancers and their
occurrence linked to mutations and viral
attack.
The main families of carcinogenic viruses
were described at the beginning of this cen-

acterized by progressive weakening and
atrophy of different groups of muscle tissue.

tury. The first was identified in 1914, at the
Rockefeller Institute of New York, by the
American biologist Peyton Rous. Rous
drew attention to a virus which, in a few
weeks, produced sarcomas in chickens.
Since then over thirty carcinogenic viruses
have been isolated. Over the last ten years,
the conviction has grown that many human
cancers are linked to oncogenic viruses. The
most well known are Hepatitis B virus,
frequently associated with primitive cancer
of the liver in the tropical zones, the Epstein
Barr virus, which is one of the elements
responsible for cancers of the jaw in Africa
and Asia (in Europe it causes the benign
condition of infectious mononucleosis), and
the papillomavirus, responsible for cervical
cancers. Mention should also be made of
the RNA or retroviruses, which include the
HTLV1 and HTLV2 viruses associated with
leukemia, as well as the unhappily cele¬
brated viruses responsible for AIDS,
known under the labels of LAV, HTLV3 or
HIV, which provoke certain cancers such as
the Kaposi sarcoma.
It had been recognized that the carci¬
nogenic effect of these viruses was linked to
the presence of a particular gene which was
an integral part of the hereditary make-up.
However, much surprise was caused by the
discovery in 1976 that all animal cells (inc¬
luding human cells) contained in their chro¬
mosomes, even when these were perfectly
healthy, genes very similar to those pre¬
viously detected only in viruses. Among the
100,000 or so human genes, only about
thirty oncogenic genes have so far been
detected. This amazing discovery has pro¬
vided some explanations of phenomena of
great importance to the understanding of
the mechanisms of tumour formation:
1 . There is an obvious explanation for the
existence in carcinogenic viruses of
determinants6 specific to cancer genes: the
viruses have "stolen" them from cells they
previously infested. The mechanisms of the
exchange between a cell's hereditary deter-

s '
minants and those of a virus are, in fact,
well known.
2. Most of the agents responsible for the
occurrence of cancers (viruses, chemical
agents, mutations) have this effect by acti¬
vating or disturbing the normal functioning
of certain cellular oncogenes.
3. It has been established that, as a gener¬
al rule, at least two oncogenes whose effects
are complementary must be activated by
exogenous influences for a cell to develop a
malign condition. This "co-operative"
action, which can be experimentally repro¬
duced by manipulating cell cultures in vitro,
clearly demonstrates the multifactorial na¬
ture of cancers.
4. Since the disturbance of cellular
oncogenes can result in the appearance of
extremely varied cancers, that is to say of
manifestations of uncontrolled cell growth,
it is reasonable to suppose that, in their
normal state, oncogenes play a central,
permanent role in the control of the process
of cell division and recognition.
In fact, it has been shown these determi¬
nants are nothing other than the "genes of
communication" between cells. Some of
them code for the exogenous chemical sig¬
nals, the "growth factor" signals involved in
this process, others for receptors of these
signals located on the cell membrane, and
others, finally, for the substances that carry
the signal to the chromosomes, once it has
reached the receptors, so as to trigger off
the cell division. These substances are
generally phosphorylation7 enzymes, or
proteins closely related to DNA and cap¬
able of performing regulatory functions.
It would seem, therefore, that a general

molecular explanation of the development
of cancer has been elucidated. Knowledge
of the precise phenomena triggered by the
activation of oncogenes should make it
possible to elaborate new inhibiting pro¬
ducts that will block the transformation to
cancerous growth and, perhaps, open the
way to new therapeutic methods.
) The neurosciences
I should like to conclude with a look at
the equally fascinating field of neuro¬
biology. No one would deny that, within the
highly organized framework of a human
being, two "master elements" account for
most of our characteristics our genes and
our neurons. Furthermore, the nature of
the dialogue between our genes and our
neurons is a central problem of biology.
I shall not spend too much time on the
formidable arsenal of equipment that has
enabled us to overcome obstacles to the
study of the human brain: gas encephalog¬
raphy, arteriography and, above all, tomog¬
raphic densitometry, nuclear magnetic re¬
sonance imagery and positron cameras (see
the Unesco Courier, August 1987). Mention
should also be made of the enormous prog¬
ress made in microscopic observation of
neurons.
-.
Yet here again, two fundamental bran¬
ches of modern molecular biology im¬
munology with monoclonal antibodies and,
above all, genetic engineering have un¬
doubtedly been responsible for speeding up
study of the neuron. Today, most of the
proteins and important neuropeptides have
been cloned. The genetic probes thus
obtained have enabled us not only to ana¬
lyse the biosynthetic activities of single
neurons with extraordinary precision, but
also to determine the molecular structure of
adjustors8 and, better still, of receptors and
ion pathways.
Without going so far as to suggest that the
brain secretes thought in the way that the
liver secretes bile, it must be admitted that
discoveries concerning the detailed bioche¬
mistry of neurons is having important reper¬
cussions on pharmacotherapy. It is,
however, too early yet to say whether the
enthusiasm of the reductionists in this re¬
gard is exaggerated or not. The psycho-
physiologists think that current notions
concerning the molecular biology of the
neuron will go the same way as the now
demoded micro-electrophysiology10 vogue.
Be this as it may, the new field of molecular
neurobiology is now open and has already
gathered a rich harvest of information.
We should, however, never forget the
pluridisciplinary character of the neuro¬
sciences. Without recourse to neuro¬
anatomy, neurophysiology and neurohisto¬
logy, as well, of course, to the study of
neuropathological behaviour and diseases,
it would be illusory to hope to understand
the memory and the major cognitive
functions.

The study of the genetics of behaviour is
also in full ferment. It is true that it throws
light only on simple stereotypes, such as the
song of the cricket, the reproduction of the
aplysia, a marine mollusc, or the short-term
learning cycle of the drosophila fly and its
memorization. It is also true that we are
only at the very beginning of the study of
neurogenetic diseases. We can, however,
sense the prospect of a modern neurogene¬
tic discipline emerging which is as worrying
in its ethical implications as it is full of hope
for the medical science of tomorrow.
This exposé of mine has left unexplained
many aspects of a biological science "in the
making", as well as of a "ready made"
biology. I have not explored the vast do¬
main of biotechnological applications; nor
have I dealt with the new patterns of phar-
maco-medicine, a glimpse of which we have
been given with the creation, by the techni¬
ques of genetic engineering, of molecules
endowed with new therapeutic properties.
I have not touched upon the enormous
field of microbic genetics, nor on the
molecular revolution that plant biology,
long left on the sidelines of contemporary
scientific advance, is currently undergoing.
Thanks to genetic engineering the elabora¬
tion of a physical plant gene map can now be
envisaged. Micropropagation techniques,11
the use of artificial seeding and plant or
microbial transgenation12 could well re¬
volutionize agricultural technology. There
is a distinct probability that the next millen¬
nium will witness great achievements in
plant genetics, the repercussions of which,
whether good or bad, will certainly be con¬
siderable for agriculture.
For reasons which can easily be im-

agined, any self-respecting science, and not
only biology (which is only one among
many sciences), evolves to the rhythm of a
kind of "self-induced" acceleration. But in a
certain manner biology touches us more
closely than the others. As Immanuel Kant
wrote concerning biology: "I see in it a
disposition of feeling that is very favourable
to morality and which, at least, prepares us
for it." And did not Louis Pasteur see in
biology a kind of panacea, generator of
blessings and of peace, intrinsically en¬
dowed, as Kant noted, with moralizing vir¬
tue? Can such judgements still be upheld?
Are they not, as the French doctor and
biologist François Jacob pondered, just a
little old-fashioned and outmoded? Is it
possible to maintain such a vision of the life
sciences despite certain obvious deviations,
past, present and to come, of the concepts
and techniques that have emerged from
them, such as the excesses of Nazi resear¬
chers and doctors, the threat of the imposi¬
tion of a "copyright" on human genes, and
the menace that will loom over the natural
resources of the developing world when
micropropagation and genetic engineering
have standardized everything?
Yet biology, like all the other sciences,
will continue to progress, to surprise, to
question. It will continue to bring solutions
and replies to our hopes and our ques¬
tionings. To be more vigilant, more con¬
scious of the limitations and dangers of
science, should not prevent us from moving
forward. Who could seriously consider
turning back the clock of knowledge? Who
could be so mad as to outlaw the search for
knowledge? We must be more knowledge¬
able about the results of science, and at the
same time be wiser and more humane.
We are about to embark on a great
adventure of the mind. Let us hope that it
will also be an adventure of reason and of
the heart.

A New World
. . . and a new era in world history
by Arturo Uslar Pietri
In 1992 the fifth centenary of an event that hadan enormous influence on the history of the modern world will be commemorated,
notably in the Spanish- andPortuguese-speaking countries: the arrivalofChristopher Columbus and his Spanish crew, on 12 October
1492, in a land which would later be named "America". On that day afar-reaching process of cultural cross-fertilization was set in
motion, which, although marked by the violence of conquest and colonization, was to create a new reality , justly called the "New
World", that would radically transform the wholeplanet. The Unesco Courier will be devoting more space to this theme in later issues;
meanwhile we publish an evocation of that new world by the Venezuelan writer Arturo Uslar Pietri.
I
N less than five years'
break on 12 October 1992. The Earth
r::: r\
time, day will lj
will come into view as the Sun progres
sively casts its light on a succession of re¬
gions, climates and peoples until the planet
has come full circle. This is what, symboli¬
cally, has happened in the course of five
centuries since that day when, with the first
light, a new age dawned in the life of man.
It all began with the most auspicious of
voyages: three sailing ships, with their
eighty-eight crew members and a man of
vision who, without knowing it, was trailing
the destiny of the world behind him. Their
initial reaction was one of mild surprise, but
the Europeans soon came to realize that
new lands and new peoples had been dis¬
covered. They did not know the extent of
what they had found, and even today it is an
effort for us to grasp the full significance
and magnitude of the event. Some consider¬
able time was to elapse before they per¬
ceived that they were dealing with a new
continent that had never been known in
Europe before. Christopher Columbus, the
"admiral of the ocean sea", thought that he
had found the western route to the Indies;
he was searching for Asia and was carrying
letters for Préster John, the legendary ruler
of the East.
When we speak of the discovery of the
Americas, we think of the first fleeting im¬
pression which it conjured up in the minds
of the Europeans. What actually hap¬
pened and this came to be realized as one
surprise followed another was that a new
age had begun. The things that Europeans
saw or thought they saw, the things they
sought and found , the things that were com¬
ing to an end or were only just beginning, all
represented a new age for mankind as a
whole.
^ In the great enterprise which led to the
European arrival in the Americas or the
Indies, as the land was known at first the
leading roles were played by the Catholic
rulers of Spain, Ferdinand II and Isabella I,
and the Genoese navigator Christopher Col¬
umbus. In 1492 they reached an agreement
(the Capitulation of Santa Fé) whereby Col¬
umbus's proposals were accepted and it was
agreed to fund his voyage. Portrait of Ferdi¬
nand and Isabella, left, is today preserved in
the Augustinian Convent of Madrigal de las
Altas Torres, the queen's birthplace. Col¬
umbus's portrait, above, can be seen in the
Museum of the Americas, Madrid.

The news of the discovery spread like a
revelation: it stimulated people's imagina¬
tions and gave the humanists grounds for
rediscovering the remote myths of classical
Antiquity. No document had more influ¬
ence on the turn taken by the European
mind than the letter written by Columbus
recording the birth of a new era. The im¬
measurable magnitude of the discovery was
unfurled step by step from the Antilles,
with their mythological name, it ranged
over the Costa Firme (or mainland), the
Darién isthmus, the marvel of the Pacific
seaboard, the conquest of Mexico and Peru,
the search for El Dorada, the circumnaviga¬
tion of the globe, and the control of the two
immense seas surrounding the new and pro¬
digious land.
It took a long time to learn what the
Europeans had found, if indeed we have
ever really succeeded in learning: it may
have been the Earthly Paradise, the long-
lost Golden Age of Greek mythology; or it
may have been the Amazons they were
looking for on the world's largest river and
on the vast sun-lit coast which they called
California.
What they above all discovered was the
boundless possibilities of the imagination.
There emerged from the writings of Col¬
umbus, Amerigo Vespucci and Pedro Már¬
tir de Anglería not only the promise of an
inexhaustible source of novelty but an irres¬
istible invitation to engage in intellectual
creation. In the end, it was to prove possible
to find everything that people had ever
dreamt of: from the Garden of Eden to the
headless men; from the lost tribes of Israel
to the imaginary city of Manoa, resplendent
with gold and precious stones; from halluci¬
nogenic plants to the Fount of Eternal
Youth.

The Old World meets the New
That day marked the start of a new muta¬
tion of the Western world. The great culture
which had slowly evolved and spread from
the Mediterranean to the Baltic and was
steeped in the fertile mix composed of the
Greek, Latin and Judeo-Christian heri¬
tages, took a giant stride to the far shore of
the mare tenebrosum, in order to embark on
a new stage in its immense creative
movement. The Iberians in South America
and the Anglo-Saxons in the North,
together with the Spaniards, Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Dutchmen and Danes who
converged on the open space of the Carib¬
bean and turned it into a strange mare nos¬
trum, all brought with them an image of
Europe that was to change its appearance
and significance. In the North, the narrowly
circumscribed transplantation of the Puri¬
tan colonies was to predominate, whereas
in the South there was an unrestricted and
mutually rewarding coming-together of
different heritages and cultures.
The very same line that had divided the
Old World into two spheres of Christianity,
with differing conceptions of man and his
destiny, was carried over to the other
hemisphere, complete with the differences
and conflicts emerging from European his¬
tory between the Protestant North and the
Catholic South, between a pragmatic con¬
ception of life dedicated to work, thrift and
peace-loving virtues and another concep¬
tion, dazzled by the call of heroism, the
tragic and adventurous sense of life, and
contempt for passive servility. In the North,
they went patiently about their work, sow¬
ing the seeds from which Montreal, Ottawa,
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles would
one day spring. In the South, cities, king¬
doms, universities, palaces and convents
were to be created in an open-minded atti¬
tude to the mixing of cultures, from which a
new form of community was to emerge.
What came into being was not so much a
new Spain or a new Portugal as a new
dimension of the historical estate in a new
setting and with different protagonists. At
the beginning of the eighteenth century, the
New World was that which had been
formed in Ibero-America, with which
Europe was not very familiar and which it
did not readily understand. It was a new
society situated not only on one shore of the
common sea, but on both shores. It was a
community that was to transform the com¬
mon heritage and to have an influence on its
component parts on either side of the
Atlantic. The day the King of Portugal set
up his court in Rio de Janeiro, it became
quite clear that such a community existed,
that it did not have a privileged focal point,
and that it was consistent with a new age.
Had it been possible to carry out the plan
put forward by the Count of Aranda,1 or
some such similar plan, the traumatic rift of
independence would not have occurred and
the powerful affirmation of the Ibero-
American community would not have been
retarded for more than a century.
The community was created by a growing
pattern of exchanges and mutual influence
between its two component parts, ranging
from mental attitudes and legal systems to
customs, diet, the economy, society and the
concept of identity.
The Earth becomes one
Had the voyage merely involved the dis¬
covery of new lands and peoples, it would
not have had such enormous consequences.
Many irrevocable changes took place at
that "watershed" date, which was also the
starting-point for many other changes that
are still taking place today. The time when
mankind lived separate existences came to
an end and a comprehensive view of the
planet was obtained for the first time. The
cosmography of Ptolemy collapsed; the
mare tenebrosum became a highway; the
centre of the world was shifted from the
Mediterranean to the Atlantic; the entire
globe was covered by sea routes; and the
Earth became one. It has frequently been
said that this represented the beginning of a
new era in world history, but it is necessary
to go further, for with the active merging of
four continents and the major oceans, his¬
tory itself took on a universal dimension.

People came from every imaginable
place, attracted by the promise of the im¬
mense discovery. The historian Gonzalo
Fernández de Oviedo, who saw them
arrive, had this to say: "Here, none of the
languages spoken in all those parts of the
world where there are Christians are mis¬
sing, whether it be Italy, Germany, Scot¬
land or England, or whether they be
Frenchmen, Hungarians, Poles, Greeks,
Portuguese or all the other peoples of
Asia, Africa and Europe."
Not only were the great European pow¬
ers stirred into action in order to exploit the
new opportunities, but trade also started
with the Chinese ports across the Pacific, in
the bid to extend the dialogue between
civilizations. Africa, isolated as it was and
with no means of taking action on its own,
suffered harshly from the discovery. In the
space of one century, millions of Africans,
bringing their cultural background with
them, were to be transported and unjustly
put to work performing the basic tasks re¬
quired to create a new reality.
It was at this time, in fact, that the New
World began to steer a new course, not only
in the narrow sense used by the humanists
of the period, but also in two other real and
creative senses that were complementary to
one another. There was certainly a New
World of the Americas which took shape in
a centuries-long development involving the
taking-over of the land, the existence side
by side of peoples and cultures, the mixing
of races and mental attitudes, and the
adaptation to new places and new partners
in dialogue.
From that moment onwards, neither
Europeans, nor Indians nor Africans could
go on being the same as they had been. A
far-reaching process of cross-fertilization,
especially of a cultural nature, was set in
motion. The end product was not and
could not be European, neither could it
be Indian or African. To varying degrees,
the three cultures were combined with one
another and blended to create a different
pattern which, although still not fully recog¬
nized or precisely defined today, was re¬
flected in all the forms assumed by people's
lifestyles, attitudes and relationships.
Whenever a world is created there is
something of a cataclysm, whether it be the
"Big Bang" of modern astrophysics or the
global revolutions of our time. There was a
great deal that was cataclysmic about the
creation of the New World, what with the
bloody struggles, the violence, the heart¬
breaking rifts, the unaccustomed circum¬
stances in which people were transplanted
and had to adapt, the ordeals of living and
dying, and the examples of cruelty and mag¬
nanimity. Yet they all contributed to a de¬
velopment lasting less than a century in
which people of differing and alien origins
came to create a new human scheme of
things against the huge and varied back-
cloth of a new continent.
When Cortés, with blood-curdling con¬
viction, tore down the representations of
the Aztec deities from their altars and put
the cross and the image of the Virgin Mary
in their place, he engaged in an act of the
most physical and spiritual violence. His
attitude, which we are now reluctant to

Bartolomé de las Casas, the "Defender of the
Indians", as depicted in a painting preserved
in the Columbus Library, Seville. The great
Spanish historian and polemicist was the
first to force a major expansionist power, as
Spain was in his day, to reflect on the wis¬
dom of its conquest and subjugation of
peoples, in the name of a universal vision of
humanity.

understand, was one that was to spell out
the singular nature of the process by which
the New World came to be formed. The
discoverers did not come to live side-by-
side with the Indians or to superimpose
their own system: they came to lay found¬
ations, to replant and to create. The priest
and contemporary historian Lucas Fernán¬
dez de Piedrahita spoke with terrible can¬
dour of the unwavering intention to "stamp
out the idolatry that has been deeply rooted
in the barbarous practices of the natives for
so many centuries".
The creation of the New World was in¬
deed cataclysmic and a new human scheme
of things was to emerge from it. In less than
a century, the Spanish, the Indians and the
Africans all became brothers in Christ and
the spiritual descendants of Abraham,
Moses and the Fathers of the Church. This
was to form the main basis for the striking
cultural unity which spiritual communion
was to impart to this new incarnation born
of old and separate cultures. The New
World, with all its specific features and
nuances, became Christian and part of
Western culture, which would define its
identity and destiny for ever more. Thus
was formed the life-enhancing clay from

Simón Bolívar, Benito Juárez and Rubén
Darío were to spring.
Far-reaching transformations
The daté of 12 October 1492 marked not
only the beginning of a New World in the
Americas, but also that of the most far-
reaching change ever experienced by the
rest of the planet in its entire history. The
historians of science, thought, economics
and society have all stressed the immensity
of these new developments. The avalanche
of precious metals from the Americas, for
example, was behind the rise of capitalism
and present-day monetary systems, in that
the thousands of tons of gold and silver
shipped back went beyond the confines of
medieval-style banking transactions and
created a transnational financial market.
Population growth in Europe, which was
instrumental in bringing about major urban
concentrations, national consolidation and
the subsequent development of the indust¬
rial revolution, had its roots not only in
worldwide market expansion but also in the
fact that the famines which had decimated
the Europeans for centuries had finally
come to an end. The role played in this
development by some of the non-human
factors arising out of their discovery of the
Americas, such as maize and potatoes, was
decisive. Eating habits and social practices
alike were transformed by the introduction
of tobacco, cocoa, rubber, quinine and Bra¬
zilwood. The red macaw and the plumed
Indian featuring in the multi-coloured de¬
cors of the baroque painters are a spectacu¬
lar manifestation of this definitive presence.
The novel concept of the Americas and
all that it implied was to change the science
and thinking of the West. In their view of
the planet and the cosmos, people had to
abandon Ptolemy's ingenuous cosmological
mechanism in favour of the heliocentric
conception of the planetary system, with all
its far-reaching consequences. The new cli¬
mates, the new skies, the reality of the
Antipodes, the inexhaustible variety of
plant and animal life never seen before,
were all to give rise to doubts and debate
and to lead to further questions, such as
whether those animals had not been known
in Noah's Ark and, if they had, how they
had come to disappear from the Old World.
The advances made in science in the
nineteenth century have their roots in the
Americas. The book by Acosta,2 Alexan¬
der von Humboldt's travels, and the arrival
of the Beagle the boat on which Charles
Darwin made his celebrated voyage off
the coast of South America and the Galapa¬
gos, were all key background material for
Darwin's formulation of the doctrine on the
origin of species.
'Utopia is American'
The ideas of independence and revolu¬
tion that have dominated the history of the
modern world have their origin in the ex¬
perience of the Americas. Utopia is Amer¬
ican. Columbus's letter and the publications
of the first chroniclers of the discovery were
to come as a shock to European thought.
The devastating impact of that scarcely
understood revelation can be seen in the
essays of Michel de Montaigne.
Thomas More's famous book Utopia
(1516) is plainly the ideological conse¬
quence of this first view of the American
world. More, the Chancellor-saint, looked
with disgust on the England of his time.
Poverty, injustice, war, hatred and power
struggles had only served to spread misfor¬
tune everywhere. His main character,
Raphael Hythloday, confirmed what Col¬
umbus and Vespucci had already announ¬
ced, namely that there was another world
For centuries, Spanish galleons (below, 16th-
century engraving) would ship back the gold
and silver of the New World to Europe. This
avalanche of precious metals had a decisive
influence on mercantile expansion and the
development of capitalism, on which the
modern industrial economy is founded.

where people lived in peace, plenty, justice
and honesty. The conclusion was inevit¬
able: the Europeans had in many ways de¬
parted from the true path and had been
condemned to live in an abominable form
of society.
In this connection, some years ago Paul
Hazard, the historian of ideas, spoke au¬
thoritatively of the crisis of European con¬
sciousness, which is nothing but the harrow¬
ing and painful reflection on their own
situation inspired in Renaissance thinkers
by the vision of the "noble savage". This
fundamental contradiction between what
exists and what is possible was to feed the
revolutionary thinking which culminated in
the Enlightenment with Jean-Jacques
Rousseau and the Encyclopaedists and with
the great and bloody baptismal rite of the
French Revolution. In this sense, Robes¬
pierre, Marx, Lenin and Mao can be said to
have followed earlier thinking on the dis¬
covery of the Americas.
There has been an overwhelming tenden¬
cy to look upon the history of political ideas
from the European standpoint. Yet it was
on American soil that the idea of independ¬
ence was raised for the first time and that
reference was first made in a fundamental
historical document [Declaration of inde¬
pendence, 1776] to the self-evident truths:
"... that all men are created equal , that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness".
It was likewise on American soil, in the
Preamble to the world's first written Con¬
stitution that of the United States of
America that there first appeared a figure
whose unwonted presence was asserted by a
phrase that was subsequently to echo as far
as the furthest corners of the Earth: "We
the people ... ".
There is nothing that exists today by way
of civilization, politics or thought that is not
a consequence, in some way or another, of
the great event which had Columbus's
voyage as its point of departure, whether it
concerns the arts or the sciences, ideologies
or customs, or the concept of the universe
and the concept of mankind itself.
If the discovery is confined to only one of
its aspects, or if it is simplified into only one
of the infinite number of facets which it has
continually displayed over half a millen¬
nium, then it is condemned not to be under¬
stood. If it is reduced to the elementary idea
of a discovery and conquest, then it will be
mutilated and deformed until it becomes
unrecognizable. There can be no denying
that there was a discovery in a fleeting and
piecemeal fashion, and that there was also a
conquest, with all its terrifying inhuman
or perhaps only too human consequences.
But this was only part, albeit a necessary
and inevitable part, of an immense process
that has no parallel in history.
Matters of conscience
There was a bloody stage of conquest,
and that word alone conjures up frightful
images in the memories of peoples, espe¬
cially among the weakest. However, while
it was unfortunately not the first time, nor
the last, that one nation has imposed itself
by force on others, it was, outstandingly,
the one exemplary occasion in history when
a conquering power stopped in its tracks to
give thought to the legitimacy and justice of
what it was doing.
The debate that took place in Valladolid
in 1550 and the royal edicts stemming
therefrom3 represented the first occasion
on which a major power called a halt to its
expansion in order to resolve the issues of
justice and conscience entailed by that fact.
It was on that occasion that a proclamation
was made for the first time from the highest
level of the State, to the effect that "all
peoples are nations" (Bartolomé de las
Casas) , that all nations have rights that have
to be respected, and that they form an
international community. What was no less
important was the fact that because they
were men, those remote and unknown Indi¬
ans had the same rights as the conquista¬
dors. Is there any human being on Earth
It was on the soil of the New World that the
first modern democratic Constitution was
drafted, that of the United States of Amer¬
ica. Its effects were wide-ranging and pro¬
found. Right, contemporary engraving of

today who would be prepared to disavow
and reject this heritage?
Mankind as a whole should be convened
to commemorate with proper dignity the
fifth centenary of that symbolic date and all
its implications, without exception and
without confining it to only one of its
aspects.
By the time 12 October 1992 comes, the
enlightened words verging on blasphemy
which the cleric and historian Las Casas
wrote to the Emperor Charles V may not
sound so much like hyperbole: "The best
thing since the creation of the world, other
than the incarnation and death of Him who
created it, is the discovery of the Indies,
which is why they are called the New
World."
1. At the end of the eighteenth century, this reform-
minded Spanish governor proposed that three vassal but
self-governing kingdoms Mexico, Peru and Tierra
Firme be created in Spanish America, with only Cuba,
Puerto Rico and some points of the mainland continuing
to be colonies.

theologians, the Council of Valladolid, to discuss the
questions raised by the anti-colonial writings of Las
Casas. One of the most positive outcomes of the debate
was a revised version of the "Laws of the Indies". This
legislation, extremely liberal for its day and intended to
protect the American Indians from colonial excesses,
was not always enforced in practice. Editor.

San Francisco de Lima
by Christina Barbin
A jewel ofLatin American baroque art
WHEN the arts of Latin America
are discussed outside the con¬
tinent, the first thing that springs
to mind, for both specialists and the general
public, is the exceptional pre-Columbian
legacy. Colonial art, both sacred and pro¬
fane, was long considered a provincial out¬
growth of the manneristic and baroque art
of the Old World, and attitudes towards it
have been very slow in changing. Yet this
period produced important works in
architecture, sculpture, painting and gold
and silver work, of which the Convent of
San Francisco de Lima is one of the most
outstanding examples.
In 1535, the Emperor Charles V ordered
the conquistador Francisco Pizarro to ear¬
mark two sites in the urban plan of Lima
then under preparation, to be used by the
Franciscans to erect their church and con¬
vent. Situated right in the centre of Lima on
the banks of the River Rimac, these lots
(with later additions) formed the largest
area ever to have been occupied by a con¬
vent in the New World: one eighth of the
area of the colonial city which had 14,000
inhabitants at the beginning of the seven¬
teenth century. On 4 February 1656, an
earthquake destroyed a major part of the
church and convent. The Portuguese
architect Constantino de Vasconcellos,
who lived in Lima, was entrusted with the
task of rebuilding the complex, generally
known as the Convent of San Francisco,
which now comprises the churches of San
Francisco, La Soledad and El Milagro, with
their cloisters, patios and outbuildings.
The problem facing Vasconcellos was
how to erect a monumental church able to
withstand earthquakes. His solution was
twofold. On the one hand, he built a barrel
vault resting on solid pillars, a technique
which allowed for the construction of tall
and resistant structures. On the other hand,
the building materials he used were wood
and a mixture that the conquistadors had
borrowed from the Indians: quincha, a con¬
glomerate of rushes, mud and plaster. Both
light and relatively elastic, quincha is consi¬
dered to be an earthquake-resistant mater¬
ial, and was later to be used for a whole
series of buildings along the coast of Peru,
for which San Francisco was the model.
Thanks to these building methods, the com¬
plex has survived the earthquakes of three
centuries.
While the profuse ornamentation of the
Convent of San Francisco is clearly inspired
by European art, in the Spanish mudejar,
manneristic and baroque styles, the mate¬
rials are an original response to local con¬
ditions. With the exception of the "altar-
piece-portal" and the lateral portal, both of
stone, the whole church, including the
towers, some 35 metres in height, are made
of quincha. This makes the whole complex
look like a giant clay sculpture.
The most talented artists of the day
goldsmiths, silversmiths, sculptors, painters
and wood carvers contributed to the
ornamentation. A factory was even set up
to produce painted and glazed tiles (azule¬
jos) to decorate the outbuildings. San Fran¬
cisco thus became a sort of college of arts
and crafts. After the death of Vasconcellos,
his disciple, Manuel de Escobar, from
Lima, completed the work in 1672. It is to
him we owe the beautiful lateral portal.
As in the case of most baroque churches
in Spanish America and in contrast to Euro¬
pean and Brazilian Baroque, the architectu¬
ral groundplan of San Francisco is very
simple: three 7-span aisles, a transept and a
presbytery. Decorative exuberance spills
over the facades, altarpieces, domes and
towers. Wealth of form makes up for mod¬
esty of materials: the church is literally co¬
vered in relief decoration.
The two bossed towers flank a stone
"altarpiece-portal". It dates from 1664 and
is the work of Vasconcellos. Damián
Bayon, a Argentine historian, describes it
as "stone chiaroscuro proliferation", a
lavish but harmonious mass of sculp¬
tures, niches, frontispieces, windows and
pilasters.
These "altarpiece-portals", typical of
Latin American churches, date back to six¬
teenth-century Spain. The altarpiece is
brought forward to the church portal, bring¬
ing religion to the street. This was consi¬
dered essential by the conquistadors, who
saw Christianity as a great unifying bond
between populations of different origins.
San Francisco was the church attended by
the Viceroy of Peru and his Court, and for
this reason it received many donations and
legacies, generated by the rich Peruvian
gold and silver mines. The convent thus
accumulated a vast treasure, part of which
disappeared in the nineteenth century dur¬
ing the wars of independence. Nevertheless
it can boast today some outstanding works
of art.
Besides the fifteen canvases of the Apos¬
tolado (one of only three in the world)
painted by the Spanish artist Francisco de
Zurbarán and his workshop, there are
thirty-nine canvases in the main cloister,
painted between 1670 and 1672 by four local
artists (Francisco Escobar, Fernando de
Noriega, Andrés de Liébana and Diego de
Aguilera), representing the life of the
founder of the Order; a triptych by Angeli-
no Medoro and a St. Bonaventura by thé
same artist; eleven seventeenth-century
Flemish canvases of the school of Rubens; a
Coronation ofthe Virgin by Juan Solórzano,
Saint Bartholomew, from the atelier of Fran- ^
cisco de Zurbarán (1598-1664). The canvas
forms part of a series of fifteen in the Con¬
vent of San Francisco de Lima. Restoration
work on these paintings was carried out in
1987 as part of a vast endeavour to save the
convent undertaken by the Government of
Peru with the aid of Unesco, the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and other organizations.
a native of Cuzco, and many other paintings
of the same school. An exceptional ensem¬
ble of Sevillian azulejos adorns the main
cloister, not to mention all the carvings,
furniture, and delicately wrought silver and
gold ware. The library deserves special
mention. It contains numerous manuscripts
and more than 25,000 printed volumes, in¬
cluding fifteenth-century incunabula and
many sixteenth-century first editions.
Earthquakes (especially that of 1974),
the ravages of time, constant humidity, but
also human negligence, have gravely dam¬
aged the convent. In 1941, the Government
of Peru declared it a national monument
and began urgent restoration work. Since
1978, Unesco, in collaboration with the Un¬
ited Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), has contributed some 300,000
dollars towards technical assistance, train¬
ing of restoration experts and equipment.
Some of the consolidation work to be
carried out is particularly urgent, but Peru is
experiencing a difficult economic situation
and cannot meet all the costs involved. To
raise the 3 million dollars that are needed, it
is essential that the international commun¬
ity rally to the country's aid, as the Direc¬
tor-General of Unesco explained in his
appeal launched from Lima on 2 April 1987.
It is to be hoped that the response will be
generous, as it has been in favour of other
major universal works of art which bear
witness to past cultures, such as the Borobu-
dur monument or the Nubian temples. The
loss of what was the most beautiful orna¬
ment of the "city of the kings", today a
living testimony to the history of South
America, would be irreparable.
CHRISTINA BARBIN, ofArgentina, has worked
for several years as an editor in Unesco's Office of
Public Information. She has published a number
of articles on cultural themes in the information
bulletins ofdifferent countries, and is the author of

The complex known as the Convent of San

of San Francisco.
The Portuguese architect Constantino de
Vasconcellos, who was commissioned to re¬
build the Convent of San Francisco in the
mid- 17th century after an earthquake had
largely destroyed it, searched for a light and
flexible form of construction that would
withstand earth tremors. He hit on the idea
of using as building materials wood and
quincha, a conglomerate of rushes, mud and
plaster traditionally used by the Indians,
instead of stone or brick. This unusual and
economical technique met with great suc¬
cess, and is being revived today in the res¬
toration of certain parts of the convent
buildings.
The interior of the convent is profusely de¬
corated. Below, detail of the magnificent

Dependence that is detrimental to progress
Africa is going through a development crisis "influenced by the
emergence of new problems of exceptional gravity	 It is
becoming increasingly difficult to maintain broad sectors of the
population above subsistence level	 The food and health
»situation is becoming more and more precarious. Infant
mortality is rising. In ecological terms, Africa's environment is
deteriorating." This is the alarming opening statement of "The
Kilimanjaro Declaration", adopted on 15 July 1987 by the
Second Conference of Ministers Responsible for the
Application ofScience and Technology to Development in
Africa (CASTAFRICA II), organized by Unesco in Arusha,
United Republic ofTanzania. How can this situation be
rectified? "The only way to improve the standards of living of
the peoples ofAfrica", the Declaration goes on, "is to take
practical action to develop their scientific and technological
capabilities in a spirit ofunity and solidarity." In June 1987 a
First Congress of African Scientists, convened by the
Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) in Brazzaville (Congo),
was attended by eminent scientists from Africa and from other
regions of the world. These initiatives underline the fact that
Africa's prime strategic objective is to reduce its dependence in
the field of science and technology, and to develop its immense
economic, social and cultural potential. Published on the
following pages are extracts from two documents submitted to
CASTAFRICA II: the first, from the OAU, outlines the science
and technology situation in Africa today; and the second, from
Unesco, is concerned with the development problems of the
African continent.
AFTER two decades of in¬
dependence enjoyed by
the majority of African
States, it is apparent that, despite
the efforts of governments and
populations, they "are not yet in
control of the phenomena associ¬
ated with the development of the
contemporary world, the concep¬
tual systems and the general con¬
ditions governing life on earth
that will most strongly affect their
future", in the words of Alioune
Diop, Senegalese founder of the
Présence Africaine publishing
company in Paris. None of the
States has acquired the basic
minimum of scientific and tech¬
nological know-how needed to
bring about the required econo¬
mic breakthrough.
It is clear that by dint of having
looked to the outside and having
organized itself in terms of and for
the benefit of the outside world,
Africa is now in a situation of
economic and technical depen¬
dence. Admittedly, the concept
of technical dependence has
many meanings which range from
mutual trust to subordination.
Where there is mutual trust we
can only be glad: such a situation
engenders prosperity and de¬
velops scientific co-operation. In
the latter case, however, depend-
| Despite Africa's serious scientific
and technological deficit, in certain
sectors the most advanced techni¬
ques are in use. Pharmaceuticals are
being manufactured as a result of

al properties of the brazzeana plant

ence is based on a unilateral and
asymmetrical relationship, in
which one party, Africa, is unfor¬
tunately in a markedly inferior
position.
In the meantime, new disci¬
plines are developing in the indus¬
trialized countries, such as gene¬
tic engineering, robotics, micro¬
computing, remote-sensing,
photo-electric and aerospace
technology and microbiology.
The developed countries con¬
tinue to lead the world in all these
fields. Ninety-five per cent of all
research and development takes
place in these countries. The con¬
sequences of this state of affairs
are unimaginably far-reaching.
What is Africa's place in this
changing situation? Admittedly,
some progress has been made in
the past few years. The reports
National Science Policies in Africa
and Survey on the Scientific and
Technical Potential of the Coun¬
tries of Africa, submitted by Un¬
esco in 1974 to the First Confer¬
ence of Ministers Responsible for
the Application of Science and
Technology to Development in
Africa (CASTAFRICA I), reveal
that at the time Africa had nearly
700 research institutions em¬
ploying more than 6,000 full-time
researchers, 5,000 part-time re¬
searchers and some 20,000 tech¬
nicians. In all, approximately
30,000 people were engaged in
research and experimental de¬
velopment.
Discoveries made in the field of
biology in Africa are already in¬
fluencing medicine and food pro¬
duction to a considerable extent.
In Cameroon, the establishment
of an industrial unit for manufac¬
turing medicines was one of the
results of the research carried out
on the medicinal properties of the
Pentadiplandra brazzeana plant
family. Dr. Thomas Wandji, au¬
thor of this research, acknow¬
ledges that "given the efficacy and
considerable originality of the
brazzeana, medicines based on
these substances might well cre¬
ate a considerable stir all over the
world". Our geneticists are en¬
deavouring to improve our natur¬
al, animal and vegetable re¬
sources and are studying ecosy¬
stems and pollution problems.
Our governments have allocated
substantial funds to cover running
costs and investments, despite the
difficult economic climate.
I Funding research
Nevertheless, Africa is still a
consumer of science and technol¬
ogy and its lack of progress in
several areas is a cause of con¬
cern. Fewer than ten African
States are close to the target set by
the United Nations with regard to
the training of researchers, name-'
ly 230 research workers to every
million inhabitants. In 1980,
Egypt had 500, Ghana 474, Tuni¬
sia 560, Senegal 240, Kenya 160,
Côte d'Ivoire 155 and the Libyan
Arab Jamahiriya 103. In some
cases, up to 60 per cent of them
were foreigners. In 1974, out of a
total of 2,978,204 scientists and
engineers worldwide, 94.1 per
cent were working in the indus¬
trialized countries, 5.8 per cent in
the developing countries and 0.1
per cent in the least developed
countries. Of the 12,000 resear¬
chers in Africa, only 9 per cent
work in research, and 55 per cent
in higher education.
The financing of research also
calls for a number of comments.
In 1978, the average per capita
expenditure on research and de¬
velopment was 2.75 dollars in the
developing countries (0.38 per
cent of GNP), as against 147 dol¬
lars in the Organization for Eco¬
nomic Co-operation and De¬
velopment (OECD) countries (2
per cent of GNP) and 186 dollars
(2.8 per cent of GNP) in the East
European countries.
Many African States do not
have a separate item for research
in their budget. However, the in¬
ternational conference held in
Lagos (Nigeria) in 1964 recom¬
mended that approximately 0.5
per cent of GNP be allocated to
research and development and
that this amount be periodically

reassessed. At present, Côte
d'Ivoire allocates to R&D 0.6 per
cent of its GNP. In 1978, Senegal
spent 33 per cent of its budget on
education, training and culture
and 1.2 per cent of its GNP on
scientific and technical research.
In Tunisia, the funds spent on
research are already equivalent to
more than 3 per cent of the gov¬
ernment's revenue. Elsewhere,
the rate varies between 0.1 per
cent and 0.3 per cent.
With regard to scientific in¬
formation and documentation
and extension work, there is no
lack of impediments. In Science
and the Factors of Inequality, a
collective work published by Un¬
esco in 1979, Ahmad Y. al-Has-
san, Rector of the University of
Aleppo (Syrian Arab Republic),
asserts that in the Arab and Mus¬
lim countries only six university
libraries have more than 200,000
volumes each. Researchers are
obliged to travel around " ... to
those distant lands where know¬
ledge is developed", according to
the Beninese philosopher Paulin
Hountondji. At a symposium
organized in Yaounde
(Cameroon) in 1980 by the Afri¬
can Intellectual Property Orga¬
nization (OAPI), it was pointed
out that a great many exploitable
patents covering African pro¬
ducts were gathering dust in files:
technical information does not
circulate properly, nor, alas, is it
used to good effect.
i Shortage of equipment and
' personnel
The field of computer technol¬
ogy makes an interesting case
study. In Africa the supply of
equipment was initially unco¬
ordinated. Subsequently the
situation improved considerably,
especially in Algeria and Tunisia.
However, the proportion of GNP
devoted to computer technology
in these two countries is still
small.
In 1979, according to a survey
by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) in
144 African institutions, the num¬
ber of computers was as follows:
99 in North Africa, 29 in West
Africa, 25 in Central Africa, and
104 in East Africaa total of 257.
The implementation of Africa's
Priority Programme for Econo¬
mic Recovery (1986-1990) calls
for the effective and widespread
use of computer technology.
The "brain drain" of trained
scientists and technicians is
another serious problem. The
reasons for this are well known:
unsatisfactory working conditions
and research facilities, low salar¬
ies, lack of career prospects, and
the low esteem in which research¬
ers are held. Many qualified can
didates, facing the prospect of un¬
employment, no access to facili¬
ties and information or personal
fulfilment, either move to the in¬
dustrialized countries, or accept
administrative posts in which
their university training and their
skills are put to very little use.
Between 1962 and 1967, 70,000
trained professionals from de¬
veloping countries settled in the
United States. Each year, 10,000
intellectuals leave the Arab coun¬
tries for countries with high tech¬
nological and industrial potential.
This phenomenon has been refer¬
red to as "transfer of technology
in reverse". It is estimated that
between 1960 and 1972 the under¬
developed countries trained some
227,000 specialists for three in¬
dustrialized countries: the United
States, the United Kingdom and
Canada.
Science is becoming increasing¬
ly costly, with the result that the

Medical science is highly developed
in Africa, particularly some of its
most advanced techniques. Left,

African States are finding it very
difficult to finance research and
the requisite facilities. For exam¬
ple, in order to develop computer
technology in the Congo, the
seventy-five projects adopted will
require approximately 2,600
months of planning and nearly
29,000 hours of tests over five
years, and will cost approximately
1,400 million CFA francs.
Moreover, there is a shortage of
computer personnel.
The technology gap
The problems of development
have sparked off a great debate in
Africa. If this debate is confined
to Africa's slow technological
progress, the following points
emerge:
the lack of "political will" to
organize and promote scientific
development; this is often appa¬
rent in the absence of science
policy;
society's low regard for resear¬
chers; the absence in most cases
of a statute defining their status in
the national public service; the
intolerance shown towards them,
which must be seen as one of the
causes of the brain drain; the lack
of dialogue between scientists and
government, which creates block¬
ages detrimental to the develop¬
ment of science in Africa; .
the fact that the content of, and
present trends in, science and
technology in Africa still depend
very largely on external needs and
interests, particularly those of
multinational companies.
History repeatedly shows that
no country has developed signifi¬
cantly without a basic minimum
of research, science and tech¬
nology. In the changing socio¬
economic pattern of the modern
world, scientific advances and
technological inventions have
made an immense contribution to
the development of the produc¬
tive forces, which have brought
improvements to people's work¬
ing and living conditions.
Tremendous progress was made
throughout Europe, North
America, Japan, Australia, New
Zealand and even in some coun¬
tries that were in the process of
industrialization, so that many
Africans are now amazed at the
scientific progress and technolo¬
gical achievements of those coun-

Although "enrolment in higher
education has increased eightfold
since 1960", seven African countries
still have no university. Moreover,
too few students are graduating in
scientific and technical subjects, and
there is a shortage of suitable equip¬
ment and qualified teachers. Right,

tries, forgetting that these great
innovations, far from being for¬
tuitous, are simply the result of
human beings' determination to
master the environment in which
they live by giving full rein to
their natural curiosity and
creativeness.
In its present state, Africa must
develop or perish. It can no lon¬
ger allow millions of its children
to languish and vegetate in in¬
sanitary hovels, threatened by
every affliction, while it possesses
vast potential waiting to be de¬
veloped.
Despite the problems which
assail it from every side, Africa
cannot sacrifice its future to short-
term requirements. The prime
strategic objective in the field of
science and technology must be to
reduce its absolute dependence.
There are several reasons for
doing so: firstly, economic
reasons. African States are sink¬
ing deeper into debt every day
and are constantly increasing the
deficit of their balance of
payments. The lack of skilled
manpower and servicing possibili¬
ties add greatly to the cost of
maintaining imported equip¬
ment, and foreign technical assist¬
ance is not cheap.
One consequence of this de¬
pendence is, of course, the power
that it gives to countries exporting
science and technology to deter¬
mine the policy of under¬
developed countries. For exam¬
ple, they can erect strong protec¬
tionist barriers against those
countries, which may also be
forced to purchase machines and
other goods exclusively from one
specific supplier. Many African
governments lack the institution¬
al and technical resources which
would enable them to make an
informed choice between the
different technologies available
to them. They are often subjected
to commercial and political press¬
ure so that immediate concerns
take precedence over long-term
provisions.
Towards self-reliance
Will Africans have a place in
the world of the year 2000?
Whether we take the year 2000 or
the year 2050, we can achieve a
better future only if we create the
components from which it will be
built, and create them now. A
number of major changes is
essential.
In July 1979, the Heads of State
and Government of the Organiza¬
tion of African Unity (OAU)
meeting in Monrovia made a
commitment to "put science and
technology in the service of de¬
velopment by reinforcing the
autonomous capacity of our coun¬
tries in this field". Science and
technology are among the sectors
which are given a prime position
in Africa's Priority Programme
for Economic Recovery (1986-
1990). The Lagos Plan of Action
(1980-2000) called on African
States to invest sufficient re¬
sources in the promotion of
science and technology.
How can this be achieved? Two
approaches are possible. One
would be to induce Africans to
create at all costs, to reinstate,
develop, promote and make sys¬
tematic use of their own endoge¬
nous scientific and technological
knowledge. The other approach
would seek to master the use of
scientific and technological know¬
ledge from outside Africa and to
assimilate it.
The first approach in isolation
would lead to autarchy, which
would be fatal, for in order to
progress, science needs inputs
from home and abroad. The
second approach would lead to
mimicry, the harmful consequ¬
ences of which are well known,
The ideal middle course would
take account of the need to re¬
main rooted in one's home
ground while becoming receptive
to the outside world. According
to the Lagos Plan of Action "Afri¬
ca must cultivate the virtue of self-
reliance. This is not to say that the
continent should totally cut itself
off from outside contributions.
However, these outside contribu¬
tions should only supplement our
own efforts".
Science and technology func¬
tion most effectively when fed by
contributions from home and
abroad. For that reason, Recom¬
mendation 4 of CASTAFRICA I
(1974) emphasized the need for
each country to establish
appropriate machinery to be re¬
sponsible for the elaboration of a
national science policy and cap¬
able of promoting genuine re¬
search for development and en¬
couraging a spirit of creativity and
innovation.
A strategy for success
Success comparable to that en¬
joyed by Japan since the Meiji
period is possible in Africa, but it
is held in check or even thwarted
by a number of obstacles. The
internal consolidation of nations
which are often disparate, as a
result of frontiers imposed by the
colonial powers, seems to have
led to overdue emphasis being
given to the political aspects of
every problem, in the sense that
winning and keeping power take
precedence over technical effi¬
ciency. This is compounded by
the almost universal indifference
shown towards scientists and
cultural figures. These negative
factors have all been responsible
for poor results: the insignificance
of research centres and the abs¬
ence or inconsistency of policies
for culture and science.
The fact must be recognized
that modern research requires a
developed productive base which
we Africans do not yet possess.
Research in our States, at pre¬
sent, is essentially colonial in
character and outward-oriented,
an inheritance from the past. It is
not directed towards satisfying
the essential needs of the peoples
of Africa. The products of our
research centres are not for our
own consumption; these centres
are still concerned with improving
the quality and the profitability of
products for export. Research
topics, funding, staff, almost
everything comes from abroad,
and in some cases returns there.
In order to remedy this situa¬
tion our States must decisively re¬
direct research towards satisfying
not only material but also cultural
objectives. Pure and applied re¬
search must seek to increase self-
sufficiency in all areas, and to
mobilize all material and human
resources for development.
All such goals are conceivable
if the political will exists at the
highest level to develop a science
and technology policy worthy of
the name and to establish planned
objectives and a strategy for
achieving them.

The development crisis
in Africa
Africa possesses enormous mineral
wealth, including 30 per cent of all
known uranium reserves, as well as
vast rivers with the potential to
supply around a quarter of the
world's hydro-electric power. Be¬
low, the Arlit uranium mine in
north-western Niger.
T
EVERYONE agrees that
the present development
crisis in Africa is alarming.
Yet it is not due to a shortage of
human or natural resources. In
addition to the enormous poten¬
tial of its young population (46
per cent under the age of 15), this
second largest continent after
Asia, with an area of 30.3 million
km2, still has 800 million hectares
of potentially arable land (al¬
though only 170 million were
cultivated in 1985). Africa's share
of world mineral reserves is 96 per
cent for diamonds, 90 per cent for
chromium, 85 per cent for plati¬
num , 50 per cent for cobalt, 55 per
cent for manganese, 40 per cent
for bauxite, 13 per cent for cop
per, 50 per cent for phosphates
and almost as much for gold, and
30 per cent for thorium and ura¬
nium; it also has large deposits of
nickel, lead and iron.
Moreover, the continent's huge
energy potential is as yet virtually
untapped: to date only ten Afri¬
can countries are oil producers
and although Africa possesses 20
to 27 per cent of the world's
hydro-electric potential, it has
harnessed only a very small part
of it. It is therefore surprising that
a continent so well endowed with
natural wealth should be in a state
of economic stagnation, or even
decline.
Should we not seek the cause of
the problem in the inadequacy of
Africa's scientific and technolo¬
gical capacity? This seems to have
been the conclusion reached by
the Organization of African Uni¬
ty (OAU) during the preparation
of Africa's Priority Programme
for Economic Recovery, in which
it is stated that: "Experience indi¬
cates that no country has attained
any breakthrough in its economic
development without a minimum
science and technology base."

economic systems of Africa,
unsuitable development policies
and strategies, the educational
situation and the handicap
of illiteracy.
The division into a multitude of
small States is the first obvious
problem for the peoples of Afri¬
ca. The natural wealth referred to
above is very unevenly distri¬
buted among more than fifty
States with, at present, over 500
million inhabitants. Ten per cent
of them live in countries poorly
endowed with natural resources
and half of them, spread among
thirty-four African States south of
the Sahara, live in poorly irri¬
gated or drought-prone areas.
These and many other geo¬
graphical and linguistic consid¬
erations are so many reflections
of a fragmentation generating
economic, commercial, scientific
and technological constraints that
are difficult to surmount within
territorial boundaries which are
usually narrow and often not
clearly defined. This can be illus¬
trated by the following statistics:
in 1983, 39 African States had
fewer than 10 million inhabitants
each. These included 12 of the 14
land-locked States of Africa,
mostly in the Sahel region, and 12

K
States with fewer than 1 million
inhabitants. Of the 37 countries
designated by the United Nations
as the "least developed countries"
(LDCs), 26 are in Africa; 24 of
them are classified as countries
which do not produce enough
food to support themselves and 21
are on the World Bank's list of
low-income countries. The eco¬
nomic development of all these
countries would certainly benefit
if they belonged to regional co¬
operation groups or to subregion¬
al economic communities.
All the characteristic features
of underdevelopment are to be
found in African economies.
Based essentially on exports of
raw materials and mass imports of
manufactured goods, these eco¬
nomies are characterized by de¬
pendence, a low growth rate of
gross domestic product (GDP)
estimated at 1 per cent for the
continent as a whole between
1980 and 1984a huge trade de¬
ficit and a heavy foreign debt,
representing 43.8 per cent of
GDP and 187 per cent of the value
of exports and non-factor servi¬
ces* in 1984.
* Not including factor incomes (work and
capital).
The limited range of exports
makes African economies even
more vulnerable. While raw
material prices are collapsing on
the world market, the manufac¬
tured goods imported by African
countries to meet their consumer
needs are becoming more and
more costly, entailing a persistent
deterioration in" the terms of
trade.
As a result, the world economic
crisis which has now lasted for
over a decade has had a harsher
impact on the African economies,
leading to an unprecedented
social, economic and food supply
crisis in Africa. This situation is in
fact only the final stage in a pro¬
cess which began long ago, with
the introduction of economic
structures during the colonial era
based on production strategies
whose chief objective was the ful¬
filment of needs external to the
African continent.
Economics of dependence
After twenty-fivê years of inde¬
pendence in the case of most Afri¬
can States, these structures have
changed very little, and African
economies are still largely depen¬
dent. The development policies
implemented by African coun¬
tries themselves have created the
following additional inade¬
quacies: limited development of
human resources and failure to
exploit them properly; extremely
inadequate scientific and tech¬
nological capacity, reflected in
low labour and capital producti¬
vity; poor organizational and
management capabilities of both
public and private administra¬
tions and enterprises.
In agriculture, the dominant
sector in most African econo¬
mies, development policies and
strategies are marred by inade¬
quate investment, lack of incen¬
tive measures for farmers, short¬
comings in the application of re¬
search findings due to the limited
development of extension ser¬
vices (especially in the case of
food crops), the lack of a pricing
policy and the inadequacy of the
system for the marketing, distri¬
bution, storage and conservation
of agricultural produce.
The industrial sector is still un¬
developed and heavily dependent
on foreign capital. Most com¬
panies are established by means
of transfers of frequently cumber¬
some foreign technology that is
ill-suited to the economic situa
tion in African countries. As a
result, the goods produced by
local enterprises are far from
competitive.
In 1980, the industrial sector
accounted for only 9.8 per cent of
the formation of GDP in the re¬
gion and Africa's share in world
production based on value added
was only 0.9 per cent, compared
with 2.7 per cent in South-East
Asia and 6 per cent in Latin
America.
I Progress in education
A substantial effort has been
made in the field of education
since the Conference of African
States on the Development of
Education in Africa, held in
Addis Ababa in May 1961, where
it was agreed that by 1980 the
countries of Africa were to pro¬
vide free and compulsory primary
education for all, secondary
education for 23 per cent of
schoolchildren having completed
primary education, and higher
education for at least 2 per cent of
students having completed secon¬
dary education.
Today, about fifteen African
countries have achieved or are in
the process of achieving universal
primary education. The average
enrolment rate in the 6 to 11 age-
group for the continent as a whole
is 62 per cent and that of secon¬
dary education is 20 per cent in
the corresponding age-groups. In
higher education, enrolment has
increased eightfold since 1960 but
there are still major disparities
from one African country to
another. Seven countries (Cape
Verde, the Comoros, Djibouti,
Equatorial Guinea, the Gambia,
Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tomé and
Principe) still have no higher
education establishments. As re¬
gards adult education, significant
progress has been made, the illi¬
teracy rate having dropped from
90 per cent in 1960 to 60 per cent
in 1985 for Africa as a whole.
However, Africa is still one of
the most disadvantaged regions in

educational terms at all levels.
Despite the progress made, it is
exceptional for even 30 to 40 per
cent of children at primary
schools to go on to secondary edu¬
cation. In 1980, a total of 29 mil¬
lion African children in the 6 to 11
age-group were not enrolled at
school, and 39 million in the 12 to
17 age-group were outside the
education system.
Statistics apart, the most wor¬
rying aspect of school and uni¬
versity education in Africa re¬
mains that of the relevance of its
general tendencies and content
compared to the needs and objec¬
tives of African social and econo¬
mic development. One of the
shortcomings of the existing
education systems in African
countries is the limited develop¬
ment of technical and vocational
education and the scant attention
paid to guiding students towards
scientific and technical subjects.
Science teaching is virtually non¬
existent in primary education,
while in secondary education,
where students are first intro¬
duced to science and technology,
courses lack practical content for
want of suitable equipment and
qualified teachers.
Science and technology
teaching
In higher education, African
universities set themselves in 1961
the objective of training 60 per
cent of their total student intake
in science and technology. In fact,
no university has yet consistently
reached this objective. According
to the partial results of a study
undertaken in 1982 by Unesco's
Division of Science and Technol¬
ogy Policies for an average of ten
countries, the percentage of stu
dents enrolled in science and
technology courses had risen
from 18.76 in 1970 to 28 in 1980.
According to data published by
Unesco's Education Sector, the
percentage of students enrolled in
natural science and engineering
courses increased between 1970
and 1980 in 21 of the 37 countries
covered by the study. The num¬
ber of graduates in the three fields
as a whole (natural science and
engineering, medical science and
agricultural science) represented
less than half the total number of
graduates, with the exception of
four African countries: Egypt (50
per cent), Kenya (51 per cent),
Swaziland (58 per cent) and Tuni¬
sia (53 per cent). In most of the
other countries this proportion
varied between 20 and 40 per
cent.
Generally speaking, the major
problem faced by science and
technology education in Africa
remains the under-equipment of
schools and universities and the
shortage of qualified teachers. In
this respect, it should be stressed
that the establishment by Unesco
in 1984 of a Regional Advisory.,
Committee on the Renewal of
Science and Technology
Teaching in Africa and, at the
23rd session of its General Con¬
ference in 1985, of a Regional
Advisory Committee on Higher
Education in Africa, are impor¬
tant contributions to the devel¬
opment of the scientific and
technological capabilities of the
continent.
"Based essentially on exports of raw ^
materials and mass imports of
manufactured goods, African eco¬
nomies are characterized by depen¬
dence, a low growth rate of gross
domestic product, a huge trade de¬
ficit and a heavy foreign debt."

African cinema
A young and relatively unknown art
-
by Tereza Wagner and Claude Ondobo
ALLAfrican wisdom is to be
found in oral culture in
words, speech, symbols
and rhythm. So the highest form
of artistic expression is story¬
telling: not merely the narrative
as such, but the whole scene of
storyteller and audience, with
pauses and rhythm and concrete
ways of representing the word.
There is a strong similarity be¬
tween African stories and the lan¬
guage of film, and it is not surpris¬
ing that African cinema, born
only thirty years ago, should
already have produced some first-
rate film-makers and films which
rank with the great classics of
world cinema.
But although this cinema is im¬
portant in the eyes of connois¬
seurs and film buffs, it is still re¬
latively unknown to a wider au¬
dience, whether at home or
abroad, since it has developed in
isolation, virtually without help
from the outside world, sure of its
inspiration, its strength and its
rights. For this very reason, de¬
spite the crisis affecting the film
world everywhere, African cine¬
ma today is indispensable, since
its aesthetic, its themes and its
symbols are like an influx of new
blood. African film-making car¬
ries within itself the seeds of a
renewal of cinematographic lan¬
guage. Apart from the similarity
between the latter and African
storytelling, African civilization
possesses another feature which
links it with the language of film:
the fact that the imaginary and the
real are placed on an equal
footing.
Cinema, which is the art of
metaphorical representation of
human situations and feelings,
has a language of absolutes. It
brooks no half-measures and nev¬
er says anything that does not sig¬
nify: in this it differs from liter¬
ature. This makes it an art with a
close grip on reality, traditionally
an art of entertainment but, be¬
sides, an area for reflection on all
the social, political and cultural
problems which arise in a particu¬
lar society. In Africa, modernity
and tradition seem incompatible,
more so than anywhere else. Afri¬
can cinema is striving to find a
point of convergence between
these two types of society. This is
true , above all, of the first genera¬
tion of African film-makers. Afri¬
can cinema uses the tradition/
modernity dichotomy to illustrate
political issues as well as cultural
and psychological themes.
This opposition between the
modern world and the world of
Yeelen ("The Light", 1987), by the
Malian film director Souleymane
Cissé, was awarded the Jury Prize at
the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. Set in
traditional Africa, it is the story of a
confrontation between father and
son which results in natural disas¬
ters as well as economic and social
disruption.
the ancestors is a constantly re¬
curring theme in the works of two
of the founding fathers of African
cinema, Ousmane Sembène,
from Senegal, who is also a nove¬
list, and the late Oumarou Gan¬

his career as an actor with Jean
Rouch, the French film-maker

The life of African students in Paris

by Desire Ecaré, from Côte d'Ivoire,
one of the pioneers of African
African cinema, influenced in many
cases by the Italian Neorealist
movement, has a strong social com¬
mitment as well as being an art of
entertainment. Right, still from
\lan dahi ("The Money Order",
1968), by the Senegalese film direc¬
tor Ousmanc Sembène.
the distinctively personal style of
film-directing, in the 1960s.
Ousmane Sembène, aware of
the cultural and political role that
any creative artist has a duty to
assume in society, became a film
director the better to attain his
chosen objectives. He very quick¬
ly realized that, in Africa, films
reached a wider audience than
literature. His films, like his
books, take a shrewd look at the
past and present attitudes of the
peoples of Africa. With rare cour¬
age and lucidity, this man strives
through his work to denounce
vacillating, cowardly or ineffec¬
tual behaviour on the part of
those who are motivated by greed
for profit and glory, masquerad¬
ing as religious faith and respect
for tradition. Conversely, women
and the younger generation are
bearers of the hope that some day
a fine, strong African society will
emerge.
Whereas for Sembène the two
cultures, traditional and modern,
must blend into a single culture,
in order, to eliminate both the
ignorance behind a blind respect
for tradition and the powerless-
ness that is often engendered by a
false concept of modernity,
Oumarou Ganda made a painful
choice in favour of village life.
However, he was well aware that
village life cannot remain set
apart from economic and cultural
developments. His analysis there¬
fore coincides to some extent with
that of Ousmane Sembène.
Other pioneers of African cine¬
ma are the late Paulin Soumanou
Vieyra, from Senegal, and the
Ivorians Timité Bassori and Dé¬
siré Ecaré, all three trained in
Paris; Ruy Guerra, from Mozam¬
bique, who worked mainly in Bra¬
zil; and the self-taught Mustapha
Alassane, from Niger, to mention
only the best known.
The first full-length African fe¬
ature film , La Noire de ... ("Black
Girl"), was made in 1966 by Ous¬
mane Sembène. Based on a minor
news item, this film traces the
reasons which induce a young
Senegalese domestic servant,
working for some former coopér¬
ants (French Peace Corps work¬
ers) who have settled in Antibes,
to commit suicide. The film's
symbolism is powerful, and in
some respects recalls the tragedy
of the slave trade. African film¬
makers are aware of the weight of
their history and the disasters of
submission, and until the late
1970s they used films on mytholo¬
gical, fictional and documentary
subjects, and also cartoons, as a
means of describing all aspects of
what it is to be African: in every¬
day life (Borom sarret "The
Building Site" a short film made
in 1962 by Ousmane Sembène), in
relations with the West
(F.V.V.A., 1972, by Mustapha
Alassane), in dreams and weak¬
nesses (Le wazzon polygame, a
medium-length film made in 1971
by Oumarou Ganda), and in the
battle for freedom (Soleil O,
1969, by Med Hondo).
Between 1975 and 1980, some
very interesting film-makers
joined the ranks of the pioneers:
the Malian Souleymane Cissé,
trained, like Sembène, in the
USSR; the marvellous Gaston
Kaboré from Burkina Faso,
trained in Paris; the Senegalese
Djibil Diop, director of only one
full-length feature film, Touki-
Bouki, but which is regarded as
one of the most important pro¬
ducts of the national film indus¬
try; Safi Faye, the first African
woman to distinguish herself as a
talented film-maker, Johnson
Traoré, trained in Paris; the Gui¬
ñean Moussa Kemoko
Diakité, trained in the Federal
Republic of Germany; the
Gabonese Pierre Marie Dong and
Philippe Mory, both trained in
France; the Congolese Sébastien
Kamba, also trained in France;
the Cameroonian Daniel Kamwa
and the Mauritanian Med Hondo,
already mentioned, both of whom
came to the cinema from the
theatre; and, lastly, the film direc¬
tor, novelist, playwright and pro¬
ducer, the Nigerian Ola Balogun,
also trained in Paris. This second
generation of film-makers won in¬
ternational recognition for Afri¬
can cinema. >
The historical film emerged in
Africa in the 1980s, addressing
new themes which do not neces¬
sarily stem from the modernity/
tradition dichotomy. This is true,
for example, of the very fine full-
length films of Gaston Kaboré,
including Wend Kuuni ("The Gift
of God", 1982), and that of
Souleymane Cissé, Yeelen ("The
Light" , 1987) , which won the Jury
Prize at the 1987 Cannes Festival.
Wend Kuuni is a psychological
drama which tells the story of a
child who is abandoned by his
family and becomes autistic. But
this inner silence cannot remain
impervious to the warmth of fel¬
lowship emanating from the com¬
munity. Yeelen is a dramatic work
in which a father's jealousy of his
son, who is to be initiated into
sacred knowledge, locks the two
in mortal combat. The action of
these two films unfolds in tradi¬
tional societies where the conflict
between tradition and modernity
is no longer used as a frame of
reference.
If the historical film is proving
more and more attractive to Afri¬
can film-makers, it is because this
type of subject affords an oppor¬
tunity to describe the religious,
political and social order of rural
communities and to show their

Still from Soleil O ("Sun O", 1969),
by the Mauritanian film-maker Med
Hondo. The struggle for freedom
under colonialism is one of the major
themes of African cinema.
solidarity in the face of adversity,
while drawing attention to village
philosophy and ethics.
Thus Med Hondo's very
beautiful Saraaunia (1986), or
Emitaï ("Thunder God", 1971)
and Ceddo ("Outsiders", 1977)
by Ousmane Sembène, highlight
the life of village communities in
their struggles against foreign in¬
vaders, whether military as in the
first two films, or religious as in
the third. The social order, which
has been destroyed by the mod¬
ern world, is particularly well por¬
trayed in these films. In Saïtane
(1973), by Oumarou Ganda, the
harmonious balance of power col¬
lapses very swiftly when such
occurrences as adultery or incest
(as in Niaye, 1965, by Ousmane
Sembène) start to influence the
behaviour of those who hold
these powers in trust. It is never¬
theless remarkable to observe
that, once the drama has been
worked out, the rigour of tradi¬
tion restores order. In Yeelen,
the confrontation between father
and son causes natural disasters as
well as serious economic and
social disruption. But the story
ends with a prophecy foretelling
that a day will come when the
Bambara will once again be a
great nation.
While the themes represented
in African films are for the most
part universal, the unity of time,
space and rhythm found in them is
resolutely a part of African cul¬
ture and civilization. Time, like
space, is elastic, and does not
place a frame around the action.
Events occur as if the eternity of
the gods had dawned on Earth,
and as if, despite the thousand-
and-one preoccupations of every¬
day life, time did not matter. Just
like the wide, generous open
space of the African landscape,
time cannot be hemmed in by
man and it takes its natural
course, independently of human
activities. By contrast, the rhythm
of these films is beaten out by
human hands. In counterpoint to
time and space, rhythm is pro¬
vided by movement, by the most
mundane gestures, or by speech,
which always takes on an oracular
tone. This is what makes it
altogether human.
In Lettre paysanne ("Letter
from the Country", 1975), by Safi
Faye, we watch the everyday life
of the film-maker's own village
during the winter months. Work
in the fields in the mornings, the
midday meal-break, as day fol¬
lows day, punctuated by scenes
under the palaver tree and snatch¬
es of conversation, all of which
are strands imperceptibly weav¬
ing the fabric of the film. The
beauty of the countryside, the
peace of the natural world, the
weight of time, although strongly
present, do not obscure the ques¬
tions of survival that the village
must face, and do not deflect any
of the criticism that may be
aroused by traditional customs,
manners and morals.
Set against this highly political
and intellectual form of cinema,
there is also the commercial cine¬
ma of the English-speaking coun¬
tries. The Nigerian Ola Balogun,
who is probably the only African
film-maker to have directed and
produced more than ten full-
length feature films, has had a run
of successes with works adapted
from Yoruba theatre, in which
marvellous stories unfold in a uni¬
verse of music and dance. His out¬
put also includes works of a
mythological nature, such as The
Black Goddess (1979), or political
films like Cry Freedom (1980), a
protest against colonization.
These works are, nevertheless,
closer to Western cinema than
those of the French-speaking
African countries.
Although the wealth and com¬
plexity of African cinema cannot
be denied, it is nevertheless not
equipped to compete against the
powerful world film industry.
Two major obstacles stand in its
way: technique and funding. This
cinema emerged and developed
virtually without support of any
kind, whether financial, political,
cultural or technical. Thirty years
later, the working conditions of
film-makers are still extremely
precarious. Indeed, cinema came
late to the African continent', at a
time when "maximum technical
know-how" has become neces¬
sary in order to make a film with
universal appeal. Yeelen by
Souleymane Cissé shows that,
with adequate funding and tech¬
niques, a film can emerge from
the ghetto in which African cine¬
ma is at present languishing.
Since mainly experimental and
art films are being produced, the
African economic sector has not
concerned itself with setting up a
film industry. But the growing in¬
terest shown by international pro¬
ducers in this cinéma d'auteur
will, perhaps, result in a break¬
through.

The work of the great Turkish architect

IN 1988 Turkey is preparing to com¬

death of a great architect. For half a
century this architect designed and super¬
vised all major buildings in Istanbul and was
responsible for numerous projects through¬

more significant than the number of works

A The Süleymaniye Mosque (1550-1557),
Istanbul, built by Sinan for Siileyman the
Magnificent on the central of the seven hills
of the old walled city, conveys a powerful
impression of spatial unity. The two
minarets at the corners of the main structure
are taller than those flanking the portico
leading into the courtyard, contributing to
the gradual build-up towards the central
dome. The mosque complex is included in
the international campaign launched by
Unesco to safeguard the cultural heritage of
Istanbul and Göreme National Park.
man was Sinan ibn Abdülmennan, Chief
Court Architect under three sultans from
1538 until his death in 1588.
Little is known about Sinan's origins and
childhood. He came from the province of
Kayseri (the ancient Caesarea Cappado-
ciae) and was conscripted, probably in
1512, to serve in the Imperial army. Nine
years later he took his place among the
ranks of the Janissaries. From 1521 to 1538,
he participated in the various military cam¬
paigns of Siileyman the Magnificent. These
campaigns were of utmost importance to
Sinan's development as an architect, for not
only was he commissioned to build or repair
military structures such as bridges, fortifica
tions and warehouses, but he was also given
the opportunity to visit many cities of his¬
torical importance. It would not be un¬
reasonable to contend that an architect of
Sinan's calibre would have examined and
evaluated any architectural monument he
came across on the campaign routes, and
stored the information away in his mind for
future reference.
Sinan's Janissary education included the
learning of a craft: he became a master
carpenter. The experience gained from
building with wood stayed with him
throughout his career. During his active
military service he restored old mosques
and shrines when the army wintered in a
major city. Through the 1530s, while he was
stationed in Istanbul between campaigns,
he designed small buildings in and around
the capital. His earliest works consisted of
three tiny mosques, which have not sur¬
vived in their original condition. They must
have attracted the attention of influential
figures at Court, however, as upon the
death of the Chief Court Architect in 1538,
Sinan was appointed in his place. With the
construction of the Haseki Mosque, Istan¬
bul, which he built for Siileyman the Magni¬
ficent 's wife Hiirrem Sultan (Roxelana),
there began one of the most remarkable
careers in the history of architecture.
Although a great many detailed accounts
exist relating to the construction methods of
Ottoman architecture, no theoretical trea¬
tise dating from the sixteenth century or
earlier has come to light. Architecture was
considered to be a craft and the secrets of
the trade, passed on from master to appren¬
tice, were apparently well guarded. For this
reason, Sinan's professional mind is inac¬
cessible to us. However, it is clear from his
buildings that he was familiar with Eucli¬
dean geometry, that he understood the
principles of space organization, and that
he had a feeling for the subtle manifesta¬
tions of centrality and axiality in
architecture.
Sinan's early building complexes, such as
the Haseki Mosque and the Mihrimah Sul¬
tan Mosque, Usküdar, are not noted for
their site planning: the arrangement of the
buildings lacks geometry and order. But
two other great building projects deserve
special comment. These are the mosques of
Shehzade (Prince) Mehmed (1543-1548)
and Süleymaniye (1550-1557), both in
Istanbul and both commissioned by Siiley¬
man the Magnificent. He had the first built

smallpox at the age of twenty-two, and
ordered the second to provide his capital
city with a splendid higher education
centre.
With its quadriform superstructure, sym¬
metrical plan, and vast prayer hall of an
austere simplicity in contrast to the wealth
of external decoration, the Shehzade
Mehmed Mosque marks a turning point in
classical Ottoman architecture. For it is in
this mosque that Sinan reverses the princi¬
ple of interiority, fundamental to Islamic
building, by emphasizing the outer skin of
the structure.
The mausoleum of the prince, which
stands among other tombs in the traditional
cemetery garden behind the mosque, . is
similarly enriched by an ornamental veneer
on the outside as well as being colourfully
decorated inside. Its interior walls are tiled
from the floor to the base of the dome in
blue, turquoise, lilac, green and yellow. On
the outside, the faces of the octagonal struc¬
ture are constructed of polychrome
stonework surmounted by a ribbed dome
on a fluted circular drum.
Sinan considered the Shehzade a work of
his "apprenticeship". But his patron Siiley¬
man the Magnificent must have judged it a
masterpiece, since barely two years after its
completion ground was broken for the
finest of the Sultan's mosques in Istanbul.
The Süleymaniye Mosque and its numerous
attendant buildings were built on and
around a vast rectangular plaza, created by
means of an elaborate system of founda¬
tions and retaining walls on a hillside over¬
looking the Golden Horn, on the Bosporus.
On the west of the mosque compound are
madrasahs (theological schools) and the
medical madrasah all built on a terrace
32
with a row of thirty-five shops tucked under
it. To the north are the hospital and the
kitchens, with guest rooms for the caravan¬
serai in the basement, facing the street at
the back. Overlooking the Golden Horn on
the east side of the plaza, behind the shop¬
ping street at a lower level, are the second
pair of madrasahs the Third and Fourth
unique formations with stepped arcades
and rooms on either side of sloping inner
courts. Placed under the twin madrasahs is a
string of eighteen more rooms for graduate
students. On the south side of the mosque,
in the traditional cemetery garden, stand
the octagonal tombs of Süleyman the Mag¬
nificent and his wife Hürrem Sultan.
Unlike the Süleymaniye, Sinan's third
and last monumental building complex, the
Selimiye Mosque in Edirne (1569-1575),
does not have a large number of buildings.
Only a covered shopping street and two
small madrasahs accompany the monu¬
mental mosque that rises in the middle of a
great rectangular plaza.
The Selimiye is Sinan's masterpiece. The
interior architecture is completely reflected
in its external form which embodies striking
A The Shehzade Mehmed Mosque (1543-
1548), Istanbul, was built in memory of
Prince (Shehzade) Mehmed, one of the sons
of Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent. This
mosque, the First of Sinan's masterpieces,
marks a turning point in classical Ottoman
architecture. The slender, two-balconied
minarets between the courtyard and the
prayer chamber are ornamented with low-
relief carvings, and Sinan's use of a succes¬
sion of different-sized domes gives the com¬
plex a pyramidal aspect.
The Moglova aqueduct (1553), a construc¬
tional masterpiece on the outskirts of Istan¬
bul, forms part of the system devised by
Sinan to supply the capital with water.
The Selimiye Mosque (1569-1575), built at
Edirne in the reign of Selim II, son of Süley¬
man the Magnificent, is considered to be
Sinan's master«ork. The immense dome is
surrounded by four incredibly slender
minarets (90 metres high including the con¬
ical spires), which reinforce the upward
movement of the composition.
contrasts of horizontals and verticals,
curved and straight lines, solids and voids,
and also a marked distinction between the
load-bearing structure and the lace-like
screen walls. Buttressed by four minarets,
over 70 metres in height, at the corners of
the prayer hall, and surmounted by a huge
31.5-metre dome on eight elephantine pil¬
lars, the Selimiye Mosque achieves an ex¬
pression of centralized geometrical order.
Centrality in Ottoman classical
architecture was a philosophical statement
of the unity of space under a vast dome,
symbolizing the totality of the universe and
the Oneness of Allah. The integration of
architectural space brought with it the need
for height; stressing the vertical dimension
fostered exteriority by increasing the
amount of exposed wall surfaces requiring
articulation. This requirement was success¬
fully met by Sinan in the sixteenth century
when he brought the rationale of the cen¬
tralized building to its logical conclusion in
his superb imperial mosques. Where Asia
embraced Europe and Islam and Christian¬
ity overlapped, he integrated the precepts
of Islamic interiority with Graeco-Roman
exteriority to produce a universal
architecture.

architecture and head of the faculty ofscience and
arts at Bogazici University, Istanbul. A specialist

Sinan and Palladio
The parallel development of two master-builders
by Selda Besnier-Kiligoglu
Thanks to the skilful positioning of a great
many openings, the interior of the Selimiye
Mosque, built by the Turkish architect
Sinan at Edirne (Turkey), is bathed in a
strong light which intensifies the impression
of spatial unity created by the vast dome.
THE theoretical treatise of the Italian
architect Andrea Palladio (1508-
1580), / quattro libri dell'architettura
(1570; The Four Books of Architecture,
1716), is considered to be a crucial land¬
mark in the history of art and architecture.
But what is the significance of the work of
Mimar Sinan (1489-1588), the greatest
Ottoman architect of the same century?
Was he simply a builder, with no original
architectural theory to his credit?
Granted, unlike his Italian contempor¬
ary, Sinan did not leave any treatise setting
out the principles of a new theory of
architecture. But it is unthinkable that such
a master of design, who established rules of
town-planning and devised a general hyd¬
raulic system for the water supply of the
capital of the Ottoman Empire, was work¬
ing without any theoretical or critical
rationale or scientific method when he built
112 mosques and 42 masjids, 79 madrasahs
(Islamic schools), 53 hammams (public
baths), 42 turbehs (funerary monuments)
and 31 caravanserais.
On the contrary, an analysis of Sinan's
architectural works yields ample proof of
the fact that he devised a conceptual metho¬
dology similar to that defined by Palladio,
which he developed and applied throughout
his career: a process of questioning
accepted practices, which Is conventionally
known as Mannerism.*
These two architects, Sinan in the East
and Palladio in the West, produced very
different types of work: the former de¬
signed primarily religious buildings, while
the latter built a series of villas in the Véne¬
to region of Italy. But the basic similarity
between them is the parallel development
in their architectural methods: gradually

parting company with their sources, build¬
ing up a precise figurative lexicon and,
above all, searching for typologies and for¬
mal variants.
Thus the various planometric combina¬
tions in their respective output can be re¬
duced to a single spatial pattern, square in
shape: the "nine spaces" of Palladio's villas,
and the "spatial unity created by a dome" of
Sinan's mosques. The adoption of such a
formula, which would undergo many
changes as one architectural accomplish¬
ment followed another, attests in both cases
to the application of a rigorous and critical
conceptual method.
The art historian Rudolf Wittkower de¬
monstrates in Architectural Principles in the
Age of Humanism that all Palladian villas
have a regular rectangular outline, the
"nine spaces", modified by two symmetrical
wings, which determine the principles of
spatial distribution.
The conceptual ideal of Sinan, on the
other hand, whose key pattern was one of
"spatial unity" on a very large scale, was
achieved by means of a dome. The Turkish
architect worked on a great many small
sites, and the technical skills that he thereby '
acquired were subsequently put to use on
the great imperial construction projects.
Like Palladio, Sinan followed a method
based on Mannerist experimentation.
The many mosques that Sinan has left us
add up to a very extensive architectural
typology, in which the stability of the dome
is secured by means of various systems of
construction. We shall refer to only three
essential examples: the Shehzade Mosque
(1543-1548) and the Süleymaniye Mosque
(1550-1557) in Istanbul (the former Con¬
stantinople and ancient Byzantium) and the
Selimiye Mosque (1569-1575) at Edirne
(formerly Adrianople).
In the Shehzade Mosque, Sinan's first
masterpiece, the great dome of the prayer
chamber rests on four piers. Four half
domes surround this central structure, re¬
laying the thrust to the side walls. The
square layout is completed by four subsidi¬
ary domes placed at the corners of the build¬
ing. In contrast to Byzantine buildings, the
central dome is supported not by barrel
vaults but by the half domes. This technical
arrangement, which appears regularly in a
variety of combinations in Sinan's work,
helps to lighten the outline of very massive
buildings. The slender colonnades decorat¬
ing the lateral façades and the main portico
serve a similar purpose.
In the Süleymaniye Mosque, also de¬
signed on a square plan, the central dome
again rests on four piers, but here com¬
pensation is made for the outward thrust by
two half domes in the longitudinal axis and
two aisles supported by four columns in the
transversal axis. These side aisles are cap¬
ped by small domes of various sizes which
are alternated to eliminate monotony.
This type of layout, with a central dome
flanked by two half domes, has often, un¬
fortunately, misled art historians, whose
analyses have not taken account of the
Mannerist aspect of Sinan's style. This
failure to recognize the continuous develop¬
ment of a syntactical conceptual methodol¬
ogy leads them to see the Süleymaniye Mos¬
que as a copy of the sixth-century Byzantine
basilica of Hagia Sophia, Istanbul.
It is obvious on entering these buildings
that a planimetric likeness is not the same as
a volumetric similarity. In Sinan's work, the
planimetric pattern is always linked to a
hierarchy of architectural elements in the
total composition. In Hagia Sophia, the
observer very easily grasps the importance
of the side aisles, whereas the Süleymaniye
Mosque gives the impression of a unified
space, emphasized by excellent lighting
from the 128 bays set at regular intervals
around the walls. There is another basic
distinction: the minarets on either side of
the portico leading into the courtyard have
two balconies, whereas the two taller
minarets attached to the main body of the
mosque have three balconies each. This
hierarchical arrangement of architectural
elements is the secret of the ingenious
adaptation of the building to the steeply
sloping site. The domes, half domes and
minarets, all varying in size, combine to
create a harmonious pyramid-shaped
silhouette which embellishes the city
skyline.
The Selimiye Mosque, Sinan's master-
work, marks the apogee of his search for
"spatial unity created by a dome". The
central dome rests on eight fluted piers on
an octagonal plan. Its originality lies in the
fact that these piers are half embedded in
the walls which enclose the central space, so
that the arcades appear to rise directly from
the piers. This composition produces a cen¬
tral area of great visual complexity, and
recalls the determining influence of the
early Sassanid dome, supported by squinch
arches. Moreover, thanks to the skilful
positioning of a great many openings, the
interior is incomparably well lit.
By placing minarets at the four corners of
the prayer chamber, Sinan uses them as
buttresses to compensate for the lateral
thrust, and creates an exterior that is as rich
in architectural detail as the interior which
we have described. In elevation, the hier¬
archy of structural elements is dominated
by the mighty dome. The elevation precise¬
ly reflects the plan, with the result that there
are no external colonnades.
Palladio assimilated the characteristic
styles of the architectural history of his own
culture: he used the pilasters and rusticated
ornamentation of the early Renaissance
Florentine style in the Palazzo Thiene, the
high classical style in the Villa Rotonda, and
baroque decoration in the Palazzo Porto
Breganze. Sinan, likewise, referred to de¬
corative models which belonged to the
cultural heritage of his region: arched win¬
dows of Byzantine origin in the central
domes, to transfer downward the dynamic
thrust essential to the support of such struc¬
tures; ogee arch openings, showing Persian
influence, in the walls of the main structure
in order to emphasize the vertical com¬
position.
But these two master builders never, at
any time, plagiarized the models of their
cultural heritage. Their genius lies in having
assimilated the constructive and ideological
rationale underlying that heritage in order
to found a Mannerist conceptual metho¬
dology of their own.
SELDA BESNIER-KILIÇOGLU, Turkish
architect and engineer, has studied the history of
architecture and restoration techniques of ancient
monuments both in Turkey and in France, where
she has given courses on the Anatolian civiliza¬
tions. Her published work is primarily concerned
with the history of Turkish architecture.
