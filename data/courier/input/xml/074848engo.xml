This work by Rembrandt, "Woman Reading" {a study with pen and brush made about
1638) is one of 1,400 surviving drawings by this illustrious Dutch artist, out of several
thousand he is believed to have produced. One of the greatest painters of all times,
Rembrandt was born in Leyden in 1606, moved to Amsterdam in 1630 and lived there
until his death in 1669. It was in Amsterdam, which this year celebrates the 700th
anniversary of its foundation, that he created all his masterworks. In Rembrandt's day,
Amsterdam was already a great trading centre and seaport with world-wide links, a
cosmopolitan city where the arts and sciences flourished, and a meeting place no less
for philosophers and painters than for merchants.

world war II
Thirty years ago, in 1945, the Second
World Warthe most destructive and
murderous conflict in history came to
an end. This event has been solemnly
commemorated by Unesco and by many
countries throughout the world.
Unesco's Executive Board, meeting in
Paris in May, marked the occasion with
a special ceremony, and last month
(October) Unesco organized an
international forum on the subject in
Warsaw with the Polish National
Commission for Unesco. Other events to
mark the occasion at Unesco's
Headquarters in Paris included
a series of films on the Second
World War, as well as various photo
and poster exhibitions.
With this issue, the Unesco Courier also
wishes to mark the 30th anniversary of
the end of the Second World War. Our
number is divided into three parts as
follows: (1) salient passages from
declarations by international figures at
the special session of Unesco's
Executive Board; (2) the creation of the
United Nations in 1945. immediately
following the end of the war, with a
survey of its problems and actions; (3)
the threat to the world posed by the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Amadou Mahtar M'Bow
Director-General of Unesco
THE commemoration of the end of
the Second World War rekindles
in the hearts and minds of all those
who, like myself, were directly involved
in that global tragedy, a reeling of
indescribable horror at a slaughter of
unprecedented cruelty and magnitude.
During the six years that the war
lasted, more than 50 million persons
men, women and children from almost
every country, civilians as well as non-
civilians died in battle, from bombing
raids, in concentration camps, or from
other causes directly resulting from
the war. And to this tragic loss of
human life one must add the devas¬
tation of entire areas, the obliteration
of cities, and the destruction of works
representing centuries of creative
effort.
Cruelly destructive and waged at
the cost of untold sacrifices, the war
ended nevertheless on a note of hope
and confidence in mankind, with the
victory of those who had fought for
freedom against those who sought to
impose on the rest of the world by
force of arms a tyranny based on
injustice, racialism and violence raised
to the status of law.
The end of hostilities 30 years ago
marked the defeat of a doctrine of evil,
and it is understandable that the first
concern of leaders facing the immense
task of reconstruction was to try by
every possible means to prevent such
a tragedy from ever happening again.
Out of this determination, and as
soon as the war ended, the United
Nations system was born, and with it
Unesco, in a surge of enthusiasm
which Is reflected in the entire Unesco
Constitution. It is because Unesco
was conceived by its founders as one
of mankind's bastions against barbar¬
ism that the essential mission assigned
to the Organization is to contribute to
the maintenance of peace a true
peace which can only be assured by
the intellectual and moral solidarity
of mankind.
The Second World War was brought
about by the denial of the democratic
principles that imply respect for the
individual and by the propagation
through ignorance and prejudice of a
doctrine of inequality between races
and men. When the conflict ended it
was clear that Unesco's role should
be to help to secure universal respect
for justice, for the rule of law, and
for human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all, without distinction of
race, sex, language or religion.
This was the principal concern of
Unesco's founders, whose ideas may
be considered as the inspiration of all
the Organization's efforts, however
modest.
But every anniversary is also an
occasion for self-examination, and
today we should ask ourselves whether
those forces which plunged much of
the world into chaos 30 years ago have
really been neutralized and whether
the moral commitments which the inter¬
national community made to mankind
immediately after the war have really
been fulfilled. We must ask these
questions out of respect for the victims
of the Second World War and as a
minimum measure of our Vigilance.
The last 30 years have seen a
constant strengthening of the con¬
science of the international community.
I am thinking particularly of the upward
struggle of peoples and the work of the
United Nations system, and certain
major trends of contemporary history,
including the one which led to the
emancipation of many countries from
colonial domination. All these have
paved the way for a more just and
more fraternal order on our planet.
But a single glance at the world of
1975 reveals many causes for anxiety.
Armed conflicts have not been
eradicated (one of the cruellest wars
has just ended after devastating a tiny
country for 30 years and claiming
millions of victims) nor have threats of
war; nor the most flagrant violations
of human rights (not infrequently

y associated with the maintenance or
re-emergence of racialism or the
resurgence of authoritarianism). Nor
have we seen the end of the unjust
division of wealth among nations and,
in many cases, within nations them¬
selves.
The balance of forces has shifted
from the industrialized countries to the
poorer countries. This proves that
there are no longer any so-called
"minor" peoples and that all peoples
now aspire to respect for their freedom
and dignity. To stifle their aspirations
would be to negate the full meaning of
the victory won 30 years ago.
But even in the industrialized
countries, the arms race, embarked on
in the perhaps illusory hope of
guaranteeing security through what has
been called the "balance of terror", is
impeding progress in other fields far
more beneficial for mankind and may,
if carried to extremes, lead to the very
perversion of science diverted for
destructive purposes.
The Second World War and the
period which preceded it can teach us
an important lesson, which is that
peace can only be founded on justice
and that international co-operation,
which is more necessary than ever
today, must now enter a new and more
dynamic stage. Only in this way can
mankind hope to avert the threat of
global upheaval such as the one that
rent the world apart from 1939 to 1945,
and avert the possibility of an even
greater catastrophe that would annihil¬
ate the whole human race.
This new path of international co¬
operation to preserve peace is the one
that the United Nations and all its
agencies have embarked upon with
increased vigour, whether it be to
promote human rights as they have
always tried to do in the past, or to
attack the root causes of some of the
most serious and dangerous in¬
equalities amongst men through recent
action to establish a new international
economic and social order.
Unesco must redouble its efforts to
serve the cause of peace in all spheres
of its competence, and it can do this
particularly by helping to construct the
defences of peace in the minds of men.
As an organization concerned with the
world of the human spirit and the
human mind and invested with the
global authority which its virtual uni¬
versality has conferred upon it, Unesco
can, I am convinced, contribute increas¬
ingly to the practical fulfillment of
human rights and, if its Member States
overcome their differences, it will one
day come to be recognized by all
mankind as a spiritual forum embodying
the conscience of the world.
Hector Wynter
Jamaica
Chairman of Unesco's Executive Board
In 1946, a year after the end of a war that had involved
60 countries and caused the deaths of many millions of
people, the governments of 50 states agreed to create
Unesco, whose purpose was, in the words of its Consti¬
tution, "to contribute to peace and security by promoting
collaboration among the nations through education, science
and culture in order to further universal respect for justice,
for the rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental
freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world,
without distinction of race, sex, language or religion, by
the Charter of the United Nations."
In the 30 years since then, Unesco has been engaged
in its task of constructing the defences of peace in the
minds of men. Peace is not just the absence of war, but
the active interplay of freedom and independence at the
individual and national level, with the international co¬
operation necessary to ensure independence and freedom.
It is through international collaboration that the obstacles
to active and real peace poverty, hunger, illiteracy and
the denial of human rights can be overcome.
On this occasion, the Executive Board of Unesco remem¬
bers with pride and also with sadness the courage and
sacrifice of those who died. The best memorial to them
will be through action and co-operation designed to create
a world based on justice and equality.
Leonid N. Kutakov
U.S.S.R.
The Second World War swept into its orbit about two
billion persons. It was the most bloody and most destruc¬
tive conflict in history. Millions of lives were wiped out on
battlefields, in concentration camps and beneath the debris
of bomb-blasted cities.
Every country which fought against the fascists had its
toll of dead and suffered grevious losses, but the whole
world knows that it was the peoples of the Soviet Union
who paid most dearly for the common victory, which
cost them twenty million lives. The Soviet Union lost
over 30 per cent of its national wealth and 1,710 of its
cities and 70,000 of its villages were reduced to ruins...
In recalling the decisive contribution of the Soviet
Union to the victory over Hitler, we have no intention
whatever of diminishing the contribution and the merits
of other peoples and countries. The Soviet people have
always deemed and still consider the victory over the
fascist bloc as the common victory of the freedom-loving
nations which joined the anti-Hitlerian coalition. The mili¬
tary alliance of the Soviet Union with the United States,
the United Kingdom, France and other countries with capi¬
talist systems which united their efforts to crush the
aggressor was striking proof of the possibility of effective
political and military co-operation between states with
different social systems.
The Soviet people pay tribute to the resistance move¬
ments which, by becoming such a powerful force, played
a major role in the occupied countries. The deeds and
armed uprisings of resistance groups and the heroism
of fighters in the forces of national liberation are inscribed
for all time in the annals of the struggle against fascism.
Constantine Warvariv
United States
The United Nations arose from the ruins left by the
Second World War as a symbol of mankind's determination
to work in unison in the search for peace. That historic
event deserves to be honoured. The United Nations stands
for the principle that differences should not be resolved
by violence, but that countries should agree to differ peace¬
fully, since the consequences of a new world war are too
catastrophic to contemplate.
Leonard C.J. Martin
United Kingdom
The international community has reached the stage at
which recollections of the war must give way to renewed
efforts for the broadest possible co-operation within the
United Nations. The basic principles of international co¬
operation were worked out in 1945. Thirty years later
it is important that those principles should not separate
victors from vanquished, but should increasingly unite
all nations.

VICTORY 1945
Among the events marking the 30th anniversary of the end
of World War II at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris was an
exhibition of posters from an international competition
which drew 900 entries from 35 countries. The competition
was organized by the International Federation of
Resistance Movements, the Polish Ministry of Culture
and the Union of Polish Plastic Artists. Two first prizes
were awarded. Shown here (top) is "Victory" by Shigeo
Fukuda (Japan) winner of the first prize and (bottom)
a poster by Zbigniew Pieczykolan (Poland) depicting
the Nazi swastika hung from a gallows (third prize).
The poster awarded joint first prize (not shown here)
was by Georgy Kemeny (Hungary).
Madame Sida Marjanovic
Yugoslavia
On 15 May 1945 Yugoslavia regained its freedom. But
to achieve this, it was obliged to sacrifice 1,700,000 lives...
Herbert Blankenhorn
Federal Republic of Germany
The suffering and loss of human life, the destruction of
cities and irreplaceable cultural values caused by a regime
based on megalomania, despotism and violence are still
alive in our minds. The people and the Government of
the Federal Republic of Germany abhor war and loathe the
use of threats and force. They have learnt from the
tragedy of war that they must do everything in their power
to ensure a peaceful world order based on respect for
neighbours, on mutual understanding, tolerance and co¬
operation...
Lasting peace can best be assured through the co¬
operation of nations in joint undertakings directed above
all towards the solution of global problems. Intensive
co-operation is the best means of overcoming conflicts,
which are often the result of ignorance, suspicion and
fear. The United Nations and Unesco offer the basis on
which to practise and to strengthen such co-operation,
thereby bringing about solidarity among nations.
Madame Rita Schober
German Democratic Republic
The German people suffered the loss of six million
dead. Inestimable cultural treasures belonging to man¬
kind's global heritage were utterly destroyed and at the end
of the war most of Europe resembled a vast wilderness
of ruins...
All those who wish to carry out the sacred testament
of the victims of World War II, who wish to respect the
will of those who died and realize the hopes of the living
have a duty to preserve future generations from the scourge
of war, to strengthen and ensure lasting peace, to see
that international détente becomes irreversible, and to
resolve all differences between nations by negotiation, using
the services of international organizations. These ideals are
written into Unesco's Constitution and the same spirit
inspires Unesco's participation in the commemoration of
the 30th anniversary of the end of World War II.
Kankam Twum-Barima
Ghana
Even pow while we talk and plan for peace in the
world, a clandestine traffic in arms is still going on to
areas where they are likely to cause conflagration. All
countries which manufacture, sell or buy weapons are
equally guilty.
Nicolai Todorov

Unhappily, war still threatens various areas of our
planet. Great efforts are needed to ensure that war ceases ^
to be regarded as a means of settling differences. r

The peoples of the Third World who have only recently
regained their freedom, or who are still engaged in winning
it, feel anxiety for themselves and for mankind as a whole.
Given the present state of the world and the difficulties to
be overcome in order to improve existing economic and
social structures and to promote a dialogue between
peoples of different cultures, the struggle for universal
peace and fraternity must be waged still more vigorously,
in the spirit of Unesco, on the new battlefields of education,
science and culture.
The Second World War cost the
Soviet Union 20 million lives. In
this pathetic scene repeated
innumerable times during the Nazi
occupation women search for
husband, father or son among
the bodies of men executed
during reprisals against
the civilian population.
Gopalaswami Parthasarathi
India
This is an occasion for us to reflect deeply on the
consequences and lessons of the Second World War
which nearly brought about total disaster for mankind.
It is a moment for humility and introspection and dedication
and for recalling the opening paragraph of Unesco's
Constitution: "the great and terrible war which has now
ended was a war made possible by the denial of the
democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual
respect of men..." The victory that was achieved at the
cost of enormous sacrifices was a triumph over fascism,
militarism and the forces of reaction.
Eliezer Yapou
Israel
Acting Permanent Delegate to Unesco
The Jewish survivors of the holocaust have dedicated
themselves wholeheartedly to the great ideals of mankind
and to their ideal of peace, progress, equality and liberty
on the basis of emancipation and independence. Today,
exactly as 30 years ago, the entire Jewish people express
the hope that racial and other forms of discrimination will
be eliminated forever. For it was these discriminations
which brought about the horrors of World War II.
Madame Magda Joboru
Hungary
Chairman of Unesco's General Conference
As a result of the new international balance of power
which was born in the wake of the victory over fascism,
fundamental changes have taken place in the entire system
of international relations. Due to developments, especially
those of recent years, the policy of international détente,
the practice of peaceful co-existence and mutually advan¬
tageous co-operation among states with different social
systems have become a dominant trend. All these together
make it possible to express the conclusion that now,
30 years after the victory won in the Second World War,
the very principles which moved the anti-fascist coalition
all through the war and later prevailed over the conferences
In Yalta and Potsdam, are being realized one after the
other on a higher level and in accordance with the new
conditions. A new collaboration of states with different
social systems is now in formation, for the purpose of
averting a common danger, a new holocaust, and for
realizing a common goal the creation of a new world
without wars and armaments.
In the name of Nazi racism and
anti-Semitism, 5.900,000 Jewish
men, women and children were
murdered, including 4 million
exterminated in concentration
camps, between 1939 and 1945.

THE UNITED NATIONS
AT AGE 30
The difficult path
of international co-operation
by Kurt Herndl
THIRTY years ago, on 24 October
1945, the United Nations came
into being. The signature of Its Charter
in San Francisco on 26 June 1945
marked the end of a war that had en¬
gulfed the whole world and brought
death to millions of human beings. To
the representatives of the 51 states
who affixed their signatures to
the Charter, the birth of a new Inter¬
national organization not only closed
a tragic chapter in mankind's history
but also opened a new era which would
"save succeeding generations from
the scourge of war".
In preparing the Charter of the
United Nations, every effort was made
to avoid the shortcomings and pitfalls
that had been observed in the Cov¬
enant of the League of Nations. In
place of the rule of unanimity, the
parliamentary principle of majority
rule was introduced; the role of the
Assembly was enlarged; an Economic
and Social Council was introduced as
KURT HERNDL, Austrian jurist is director
of the Security Council and Political Com¬
mittee Division of the United Nations
Secretariat. From 1962 to 1965 he was a
member of the Legal Department of the
Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
was closely associated with the work of the
United Nations as a delegate to meetings of
the General Assembly and other U.N. bodies.
Between 1965 and 1969 he was Deputy
Permanent Representative of Austria to the
U.N. Office in Geneva.
a principal organ; special emphasis
was placed on the necessity to respect
human rights and fundamental free¬
doms for all human beings without dis¬
tinction; a trusteeship system was
established to advance the indepen¬
dence of the mandated and colonial
territories.
However, it was decided to main¬
tain the requirement of unanimity
among the five major powers, perma¬
nent members of the Security Council,
in exercising responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and
security.
1945
1955
During the first ten
years of its existence,
the United Nations
created appropriate
machinery to deal with
the vast array of
economic and socialworld political,
problems.
As early as 1946, the Economic and
Social Council established the Com¬
mission on Human Rights, which in
turn started elaborating a body of
rules designed to ensure that states
respect the human rights and funda¬
mental freedoms of all individuals.
In view of the special political powers
entrusted to him by the Charter, the
Secretary-General began to play an
active political role on the world scene.
In the political field, the U.N.'s acti¬
vities were somewhat hampered by the
antagonism which in the meantime
had developed between certain major
powers. Nevertheless, the U.N. was
able to contribute effectively to the
restoration of peace in several areas
where conflict had broken out. It
achieved the first armistice agreements
in the Middle East. An armistice was
also negotiated in the Korean penin¬
sula. Due not least to United Nations
efforts, other dangerous situations
such as those which arose in Indo¬
nesia, Greece, Iran and Kashmir were
brought under control and stabilized.
Further, the United Nations embarked
immediately on a programme promoting
the attainment of independence for
people hitherto administered by
foreign powers. The Trusteeship
Council, which has now become almost
obsolete, developed into a powerful
organ, which not only supervised the
administration of trust territories but
also played a direct role, together
with the Assembly, in the attainment of
independence of those and other non-
self-governing territories.
Activities of the U.N. in the field of
disarmament did not yield immediate
results. However, at the end of the
first decade they led to the establish¬
ment of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
One of the major achievements of the
first decade was the adoption, without
a dissenting vote, of the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights, on 8
December 1948. This Declaration
continues to be universally accepted as
a standard in the field of human rights.

The United Nations, from its earliest
days, focussed its attention on econo¬

1949, the U.N. Economic and Social

While the U.N. started
out with 51 founding members, it had
77 at the end of 1955 and 118 by the
end of 1965. Most of the new mem¬
bers admitted in the 1960s were former
colonial or trust territories, mainly
African.
In fact, United Nations efforts were
Instrumental in bringing about the
independence of millions of people.
To this day, the famous Declaration
on the Granting of Independence to
Colonial Countries and Peoples, adopt¬
ed by the General Assembly in 1960,
is commonly regarded as "the Magna
Carta" of dependent countries.
The influx of new members had a
far-reaching impact on the Organ¬
ization. The power relationships which
had existed within the U.N. up to that
time began to change.
The emergence of new nations led
not only to greater attention being paid
by the U.N. to those political issues
which were of greatest concern to the
new members that is, African prob¬
lems, and in particular the situation in
southern Africa but also to increased
emphasis on the problems of develop¬
ment, which were of vital interest to
the new states.
Accordingly, this period saw the
establishment of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), which was designed to
promote international trade in order
to accelerate economic development,
particularly trade between countries at
different stages of development.
In 1961, the General Assembly
launched the First Development
Decade. Its chief goals were the
attainment of a five per cent increase
in the growth rate of the Gross National
Product of developing countries and
a gradual Increase in the flow of aid
from the developed to developing
countries.
The establishment of UNCTAD and
the launching of the First Development
Decade are illustrative of a shift in
priority which was later to become
even more marked. Realizing the
interdependence of the modern world,
the United Nations began to place
more and more emphasis on economic
development and related matters.
In the political field also, several
very significant developments occurred
during the middle years. In 1956, for
the first time, the General Assembly
established a United Nations Emerg¬
ency Force in the Middle East, designed
to separate the armed forces of Egypt
and Israel. This represented a sig¬
nificant step forward as the United
Nations had hitherto resorted to a
purely supervisory machinery for
observing compliance with truces (such
as the military observers In Greece,
Indonesia, Kashmir and Palestine).
The way was thus paved for the
establishment of similar operations of
a quasi-military nature in other areas
of the globe.
When the Congo crisis erupted in
1960, the United Nations again
mounted a large-scale peace-keeping
operation and dispatched United
Nations troops to the area. At the
height of the Congo operation some
20,000 troops from more than a dozen
Member States were deployed in the
Congo. In the course of this operation
the United Nations suffered the loss
of its second Secretary-General, Dag
Hammarskjöld, who perished while
engaged in the search for peace in
the area.
Once again, in 1964, the United
Nations dispatched peace-keeping
forces this time to Cyprus to preserve
international peace and prevent a
recurrence of fighting between the two
communities of that island. The
Organization also achieved a cease¬
fire in the armed conflict which
broke out between India and Pakistan
in September 1965. These examples
demonstrated that the Organization
was able to cope with direct threats
to international peace and security in
a dramatic way, although, admittedly,
not all such situations were brought
before the United Nations.
The U.N. meanwhile continued its
efforts in the field of human rights,
adopting two international covenants
on human rights one on economic,
social and cultural rights, the other on
civil and political rights together with
a number of measures to combat
racism and racial discrimination.
The United Nations also ventured
into a hitherto unknown field: that of
outer space. Once it became clear
that major powers were about to launch
important space programmes, the U.N.
immediately set up machinery to follow
the scientific developments and ensure
that future scientific, technological and
Informational benefits would accrue
not only to space powers but to all
states. The U.N. also elaborated a
legal framework under which outer
space activities would thenceforth be
carried out for the benefit of all
mankind.
Important principles which would
govern the activities of states in space
were laid down in the Declaration of
Legal Principles Governing the Activi¬
ties of States in the Exploration and
Use of Outer Space, adopted by the
General Assembly in 1963. This dec¬
laration later became, with minor
changes, what is commonly referred
to as "the Outer Space Treaty".
During this time United Nations
efforts in the field of disarmament
continued, the main objective at this
stage being the prevention of the
spread of nuclear weapons. One step
on that path was the conclusion of
the 1963 Test Ban Treaty (although
that Treaty was not concluded under
United Nations auspices).

from the
situation.
During the third dec¬
ade of its existence
the United Nations
was confronted with
a series of new chal-
' lenges which arose
rapidly changing world
In the political field the
effects of détente were being increas¬
ingly felt, so that the issues brought
before the United Nations were more
and more of an economic and related
nature.
In view of the growing awareness
of mankind of the innumerable prob¬
lems created by overpopulation, in¬
sufficient food supplies, pollution,
over-urbanization and increasing crime
rates, the United Nations became a
forum for discussion of these questions
and for efforts to take collective
corrective action.
It is generally recognized that the
U.N. achieved a high measure of
success with the world-wide confer¬
ences which it organized from 1972
onwards on these problems. The
United Nations Conference on the
Problems of the Human Environment
(1972) approved a Declaration of
principles on the responsibilities of
states with regard to the environment
which led to the establishment of the
United Nations Environment Pro¬
gramme (UNEP). The World Popu-

lation Conference (1974) adopted the
World Population Plan of Action. The
World Food Conference (1974), pre¬
occupied with a shrinking world food
supply, set up the World Food
Council. In 1976, the United Nations
will hold a Conference-Exposition on
Human Settlements (Habitat) in order
to tackle the problems of urbanization.
The United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) set up in 1965, has
over the years carried out numerous
large-scale investment projects to aid
the development of many countries.
UNDP's annual budget is now normally
larger than that of the United Nations
itself.
In 1966, the General Assembly estab¬
lished the United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO),
to promote the Industrialization of
developing countries. In 1970, the
Second Development Decade was
proclaimed and in the spring of 1974
the sixth special session of the General
Assembly adopted the Declaration and
Programme of Action on the Establish¬
ment of a New International Economic
Order.
Realizing the interrelationship of the
problems of trade, development,
development finance and international
monetary transactions, the General
Assembly drafted the Charter of
Economic Rights and Duties of States,
which it solemnly proclaimed on
12 December 1974. This Charter is of
particular importance and will have a
considerable impact on the future
economic relations of states.
It is obvious that the transformation
of the world's economic relations into
a system based exclusively on econ¬
omic co-operation and precluding any
economic domination will require
adjustment and accommodation even
sacrifice by all states. In any event,
to the credit of the United Nations it
has been able to set in motion a
'process of reappraisal in all circles.
The measures taken by the General
Assembly in this field were comp¬
lemented by action taken by UNIDO,
particularly by the Declaration on
Industrial Development and Co-oper¬
ation, adopted in March 1975, and a
Plan of Action, which urged that the
share in total world production of
the developing countries which have
70 per cent of the world's population
be increased from its present 7 per
cent to 25 per cent by the end of
this century.
Besides these new activities, the
United Nations has not neglected
other political areas during the last
decade. It has continued its work in
the field of outer space and has
elaborated several important conven¬
tions, such as the Outer Space Treaty
(already mentioned) the Agreement on
the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return
of Astronauts and the Return of
Objects Launched into Outer Space,
the Convention on International Liab¬
ility for Damage Caused by Space
Objects, and the Convention on Regis¬
tration of Objects Launched into Outer
Space.
Of particular interest is the work of
the U.N. in the field of communications
by direct broadcast from satellites.
In 1968 a world-wide Conference on
Outer Space Questions was held, at
which the practical benefits to be
derived by non-space powers, particu¬
larly the developing countries, from
space research and exploration were
examined.
Concern for problems of the peace¬
ful uses of the sea-bed and the ocean
floor led to the adoption of a Declar¬
ation of Principles on this question in
1970. United Nations efforts in this
field proved the need for a general
overhauling of the law of the sea, and
to that end the General Assembly
convened the Third Conference on the
Law of the Sea, which has met in
New York (1973), Caracas (1974) and
Geneva (1975), and which is expected
to conclude its work in 1976.
In the field of disarmament, the U.N.
has been instrumental in the drafting
and adoption in 1968 of the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons.
Additional conventions adopted con¬
cern the prohibition of the emplacement
of nuclear weapons and other weapons
of mass destruction on the sea-bed
and the ocean floor and its subsoil,
and the prohibition of developing,
producing and stockpiling bacterio¬
logical (biological) weapons.
Admittedly, the United Nations
during its third decade failed to
prevent renewed armed conflict in the
Middle East, in the India-Pakistan sub¬
continent, and in Cyprus. In all three
cases, however, the U.N. became
deeply involved in the direct aftermath
of the conflict. In the Middle East a
new peace-keeping operation was
launched which succeeded in main¬
taining calm in the area. In Bangladesh,
the United Nations undertook an im¬
mense relief operation. In Cyprus, the
U.N. presence was an important factor
in containing the scope of the conflict.
The problems of southern Africa are
still with the U.N. So far, United
Nations efforts to bring about the
necessary changes in that part of the
world, including the application of
economic sanctions to Southern Rho¬
desia, have not been crowned with
success although almost all the former
Portuguese territories in Africa have at
last attained independence. One can
say, however, that the prospects for
change in that area have improved,
due not least to the endeavours of the
United Nations.
The status of women, for which a
specific subsidiary body was created
as early as 1946, has received
increasing attention. As part of
"International Women's Year" a World
Conference was held this year, at
which a World Plan of Action was
adopted.
At the end of the third decade,
United Nations' activities are universal
in the proper sense of the word.
The Organization itself with 138
Member States has achieved near-
universality in its membership, es¬
pecially since the question of the
representation of China was settled
in 1971 with the admission of the
People's Republic of China into the
U.N.
What then
are the overall
achievements
of the United
Nations during
the past three
decades and what are the perspec¬
tives for the future? Clearly, the
United Nations has not met all the
hopes which the peoples of the world
had placed in it, but neither has it
failed them all.
In respect of the main political goal
for which the U.N. was established
the maintenance of peace in the
world the Organization has been
more or less successful. It cannot be
denied that the United Nations has
contributed actively and effectively to
the prevention of a new world-wide
conflagration. It has also succeeded
in preventing a number of local
conflicts and in limiting the spread of
others, thus avoiding their turning into
wider confrontations.
By its mere existence the United
Nations has a persistent effect on the
relations between states, lessening
tensions and helping to discourage the
tendencies to resort to violent action.
To that end, the United Nations has

Albert Einstein was once
asked what weapons
would be used in the
catastrophic event of a

replied that he had no idea
but that in a fourth world

SINCE World War II, the total des¬

in the world's arsenals has increased
many thousandfold. In today's world,
the potential for organized violence
has assumed grotesque dimensions
so grotesque as to be beyond an
individual's comprehension.
The total explosive power of the tac¬
tical nuclear weapons stationed in Eur¬
ope alone is equivalent to more than
30 times the TNT expended in World
War II, the Korean War and the Viet-
Nam War put together. Few of these
weapons are less powerful than the

weapons account for a mere fraction
of the total destructive power available
to the nations.
Several times in the past three
decades, mankind has approached the
brink of oblivion. How many more
times can this happen before we go
over the brink? Yet the efforts to
control the mad momentum of the
arms race have produced no significant
results. On the contrary. Military
technology advances as rapidly as
human ingenuity and skills allow.

today's reality.

THE ATOM
On these pages we present eyewitness accounts by
two Japanese of the destruction of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki by atom bombs in 1945. The texts are
passages from a book published in the Federal Re¬
public of Germany in 1961. Entitled Die Stimme des
Menschen (The voice of mankind) by Hans Walter
Bahr (R. Piper and Co. publishers, Munich), it is an
anthology of letters from all parts of the world writ¬
ten between 1939 and 1945 by men and women who
lost their lives as a result of the Second World War.

LETTER FROM NAGASAKI
by Takashi Nagai
born in 1908, professor at the
Nagasaki Faculty of Medicine
D Nagasaki 1945
IRECTLY after the bomb exploded, the reaction of
those who could still move was either to remain
where they had been at the time of the explosion or to flee
immediately. Those who stayed where they were either
to help injured friends or to try to save their apartment,
office or factory were quickly hemmed in by the flames
and perished along with those they had wanted to save.
When the fire came closer, we took refuge on the hill near
our hospital. In this way my neighbours and I escaped
death by a hair's-breadth...
Getting through to the hillside was like forcing one's
way through a white-hot jungle. Huge flames crackled all
round us: they rose high above our heads, darting back
and forth and changing direction with the wind, so that
showers of sparks rained down on us. Here and there
we came across medical students and nurses lying on
the ground. We picked them up and carried them a
little further up the hill, out of reach of the fire. All the
time I was urging those around me to move faster.
I had a gash in the right temple and was losing a lot
of blood. Eventually I collapsed. Professor Shirade of
the surgical department tended my wound and hastily
stitched it up. For a few' moments I lost consciousness.
When I came to, I found that I was lying in the grass beneath
the billowing eddies of the atomic cloud. I was suffering
terribly from my wound and had to grit my teeth to
overcome the pain. Then I began to think about my wife.
If she were still alive, I told myself, she would have
already joined me.
Next day, looking down from the hill behind the clinic,
I could see the ruins of my house. Nothing remained of
Urakami but a great pile of white ashes. Nothing moved,
wherever one looked, in. the clear morning light...
For us the atomic bomb was something totally unexpected.
I was in the radio-therapy room when the bomb exploded.
At that precise moment it seemed to me that not only
was the present being smashed to smithereens but that
the past had been wiped out forever and the future utterly
destroyed. I had seen my beloved faculty and all the
students to whom I was so attached engulfed in a flash
by the flames. My wife was now nothing but a little heap
of charred bones which I collected one by one in the
ruins of our house. Her remains weighed no heavier than
a parcel you might send through the post. She had died
in the kitchen.
As for me, "atomic sickness" in its most acute form
now added its effects to those of the long-standing illness
caused by my research into X-rays. This, along with
the injury to my right side, completely disabled me. By
an extraordinary piece of luck, three days earlier our
two children had been sent to their grandmother In the
mountains and were thus safe and sound.
The huge numbers of people suffering from "atomic
sickness", the many different symptoms of this affliction, the
deaths that came one after another all this was agonizing
for me just to think about, and I began to make all
kinds of plans to take my mind off these things. Never
before had I found my work as a scientist such a painful
burden. Leaning on a stick, my body covered with wounds
which hampered my movements, I began with great effort
to climb mountains and cross rivers in order to visit my
patients. I kept this up for two months. Then I was
struck down by a violent attack of atomic sickness and
had to give up my medical work altogether.
Later...
Already I have to ask people to hand me the pages
of this manuscript one by one. I don't even have enough
energy to examine anything through a microscope any
more. Fortunately I carry the object of my research
about with me in my own body.

The whole world was shocked when the first bombs were
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Indeed, I think that
those who only heard about the bombing indirectly felt
this shock even more violently than those of us who
were directly exposed to it. People suddenly learned,
without being prepared for it in any way, that it was
possible to reduce a big city to dust in a matter of seconds.
This prospect must have caused great consternation.
If such a weapon were used on a large scale in the
future, the human race and the whole of civilization would
be doomed to disappear.
Those of us who suffered the bombing had no idea at
all of what an atomic bomb could be. I myself never
thought for a moment that the bomb meant anything
so -cataclysmic, even though I was right underneath the
mushroom cloud. I thought it was just a super-bomb, or
something similar. It was only when the cloud began to
spread out and disperse and the sunlight (which it had
completely blotted out) began to filter through again until
it was bright enough for me to see something, that I
looked around and said to myself: "It's the end of the
world".
The rest of the world cried out in horror: "The atomic
bomb must never be used again".
And yet I hear that some people do not think the bomb
is as terrible as all that, or that it must never be used in
any circumstances: "A city is never entirely destroyed...",
they say. "There are always some survivors... Radio¬
activity disappears in time... It's only a new weapon, more
effective than any used before..."
More effective!... What do they know about it, the people
who talk like this?

LETTER FROM HIROSHIMA
by Tamiki Hara
born in 1905 in Hiroshima
Hiroshima, August 1945
I got up about eight o'clock on that morning of August 6,
1945. The previous evening two air-raid warnings had
sounded, but no bombs were dropped...
Suddenly I received a blow on the head and everything
went dark in front of my eyes. I cried out and threw up
my arms. In the obscurity all I could hear was a sound
like the roar of a great storm. I couldn't make out what
was happening. Even my own cry seemed to have come
from someone else.
Then things around became visible again, though not very
clearly at first, and I had the feeling I was at the scene
of some great catastrophe. Behind the dense clouds of
dust a single patch of blue appeared, soon followed by
more and more.
Little flames began to shoot out of the building next
door a storage depot for pharmaceutical products. It
was time to get away from there. Along with K., I made
my way across piles of debris.
Billowing clouds of smoke were rising from the ruins
of houses. We reached a place where the heat from the

"acceptable" in a nuclear war, how
much more megatonnage is needed
for superiority, and so on. We have
been misled by absurd statements
about the possibility of a "limited"
nuclear war, of "winning" a nuclear
war, of "damage limitation", of the
political "value" of overkill, and so on.
Can anything be done to move
towards a saner, less barbaric world?
The politicians say they have tried.
If they have, then they have failed.
It is now up to the public. To live in
a peaceful, disarmed world is a uni¬
versal desire. Can public opinion be
mobilized to press reluctant politicians
to pursue policies to this end before
it is too late? Mankind's survival may
well depend on the answer.
How much is spent on arms?
Each year the world spends an
enormous amount of money on arma¬
ments $210 billion in 1974. This
is about equal to the entire national
Income of the poorer half of mankind.
And it is about 15-20 times the total
amount of aid given to the develop¬
ing countries.
Since 1900, but excluding the years
of world wars, the world has spent
roughly $7,500 billion on armaments at
today's (1975) prices. This sum is
equivalent to about $2,500 per head of
the present world's population or a
lifetime's income for the average
Indian, for example.
Not only is the absolute amount of
money spent on armaments very large,
but the rate of Increase of military
spending is high. Even after taking
into account the decreased value of
money, the amount spent has doubled
since 1950. But the rate of increase
has not been a steady one. Through¬
out this century military expenditure
has escalated during wars and major
crises. Each such event has been
followed by a period of relative stability
but at a substantially higher level of
expenditure.
Which countries are
the big military spenders ?
For many years now the United
States and the Soviet Union have
accounted for the vast majority of the
money spent on armaments. In 1974,
for example, these two powers spent
60 per cent of the total. The two
major alliances, NATO and the Warsaw
Treaty Organization, together spent
80 per cent in 1974.
But over the past 15 years or so,
the concentration of military power has
shifted. This has happened because
the average rate of increase has
differed from country to country. In
particular, the developing countries
have, over about the past 20 years,
increased their military spending at a
higher than average rate. The most
dramatic examples are, not surpris¬
ingly, the Middle East countries. In
this region, military expenditure has
increased on average by 20 per cent
per year over the past decade a
staggering rate of increase indeed.
The rate of increase of expenditure
of the four major military spenders of
the post World War II eraU.S.A.,
U.S.S.R., UJK. and Francehas been
somewhat slower than that of most

other countries. Thus the combined
military expenditures of these countries
fell from about 82 per cent of the world
total in 1955 to about 70 per cent in
1974. But this does not mean that
their military capability has declined.
Instead, it has happened because of
the rapid expansion in the level of
armaments elsewhere. The entire
world is becoming more and more
militarized.
Where does
the money go?
An analysis of the military spending
of the 12 countries which together
account for three-quarters of world
military expenditure shows that about
30 per cent of military money is used
to pay for uniformed personnel.
Another 30 per cent goes to buy
weapons and equipment, and a further
30 per cent to construct, operate and
maintain the weapons and equipment.
The remaining 10 per cent is used for
military research and development.
Perhaps surprisingly, nuclear
weapons and their delivery systems
account for a relatively small fraction
(about 10 per cent) of the total
resources devoted to military, uses.
Even in the nuclear-weapon countries,
the bulk of the money spent on
weapons is used to procure conven¬
tional rather than nuclear weapons. It
is an extraordinary fact of modern life
that the capability to destroy totally
human civilization costs just a fraction
of 1 per cent of the world's annual
output.
Military research
and development
World expenditure on military re¬
search and development is, and has
for some time been, running close to
$25 billion annually about four times
the money spent worldwide on medi¬
cal research and is increasing stead¬
ily. The relative share of military
expenditure absorbed by research and
development has risen dramatically
since the interwar years from less
than 1 per cent to the present value
of about 10 per cent.
Over 400,000 scientists and engi¬
neers roughly half of the world's total
scientific and technical manpower are
now employed on improving existing
weapons and developing new ones.
Thirty years ago, only five countries
U.S.S.R., U.K., Canada and
Sweden were major weapon pro¬
ducers and weapon innovators. But,
by the early 1950s, some developing
countries started producing arms and
since then the number of them doing
so has been, and still is, increasing.
The establishment of a sophisticated
armaments industry is a costly under¬
taking and the diversion of scarce
resources to military production by
underdeveloped economies obviously
has very adverse effects on the rate of
development of the civilian sector.

THE NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE
50,000 Hiroshimas:
such is the destructive power
of the so-called 'tactical'
nuclear weapons
IN 1944, no nuclear weapon existed.
Today, there are tens of thousands.
The nuclear arsenals of the U.S.A. and
the U.S.S.R. have grown so large as to
be wildly in excess of any conceiv¬
able need, military or political, of
either power.
Thirty years ago, nuclear weapons
could be delivered only by bombers.
Nowadays, they exist in a bewildering
variety of forms: intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs),
medium-range ballistic missiles, inter¬
mediate-range ballistic missiles, short-
range ballistic missiles, depressed
trajectory ballistic missiles, fractional
orbital bombardment systems, free-fall
tactical bombs, free-fall strategic
bombs, air-to-surface missiles, air-to-
surface stand-off missiles, air-to-air
missiles, army artillery shells, naval
artillery shells, howitzer projectiles,
torpedoes, rocket torpedoes, depth
charges, demolition devices, land
mines, sea mines, anti-ballistic missiles
and so on.
The development of nuclear-weapon
systems continues unabated. Some
strategic missiles are now being
equipped with multiple independently-
targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) of
very high accuracy. Soon it will be
possible to deliver missile-borne
thermonuclear warheads over dis¬
tances of 6,000 miles and more to
within a few tens of metres of the
target. Almost incredible military
technological advances have been
made in the past three decades.
Tactical nuclear weapons
Most publicity has been given to
strategic nuclear weapons, but in addi¬
tion the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. have
deployed tens of thousands of tactical
nuclear weapons. In Europe alone
there are about 7,000 U.S. and 3,500
Soviet tactical nuclear weapons.
The total explosive power of existing
tactical nuclear weapons is enormous
so large as almost to defy imagin¬
ation. The combined explosive capa¬
bility of the U.S. and Soviet tactical nu
clear weapons is roughly equivalent to
700 million tons of TNT or 50,000
Hiroshimas. The tactical nuclear
weapons at present deployed in Europe
would, if ever used, totally obliter¬
ate the continent 20,000 Hiroshimas
would be unleashed.
Conventional weapons
Fear of the catastrophic conse¬
quences of nuclear war has tended to
obscure the frightening developments
that have been made over the past
two decades in conventional (non-
nuclear) weapons.
Although the nuclear bomb remains
the ultimate in weapons, it has not
been used since Hiroshima and
Nagasaki were blasted apart in 1945.
Yet, since the end of World War II,
tens of millions of people have been
killed or maimed for life and wide¬
spread destruction has been caused in
a hundred wars in which conventional
weapons were used. And environ¬
mental damage caused by some
conventional weapons (in Indochina,
for instance) will bear witness for
years to come of the "effectiveness"
of modern non-nuclear war.
Never before in human history has
the military man had so much, or so
varied an assortment of, weaponry at
his disposal. Not only has a huge
number of new weapons been develop¬
ed, but even older types have been
updated and "refined" to such a
degree that they bear little resemblance
to their predecessors.
The naval destroyer provides a good
example. A destroyer built in the late
1940s displaced 3,480 tons fully
loaded and was armed with six 5-inch
guns, six 3-inch guns, and five torpedo
tubes. For antisubmarine operations,
there was only a primitive sonar and
some ordinary depth charges.
Its modern counterpart displaces
6,900 tons fully loaded. The warship
has an armament of only two 5-inch
dual purpose guns. But these are
automatically fired and operated, using
radar and a remote control television
system to direct fire against surface
and aircraft targets. There is also a
missile system for defence purposes.
The antisubmarine equipment includes
highly sophisticated sonar systems
and antisubmarine missiles, armed
with either conventional or nuclear
warheads and fired from an antisub¬
marine helicopter.
The warships, packed with electronic
equipment, are so highly automated
that, despite being twice as big and
infinitely more complex than the 1940-
type destroyers, they carry about the
same crews.
Even more dramatic changes have
occurred in military aircraft. Com¬
pared with modern military aircraft,
those of only 20 years ago seem to
belong to another era.
A new jet fighter, for instance,
carries a variety of missiles in addition
to a 20-mm anti-aircraft gun capable of
firing 1,000 rounds a minute. It
resembles a flying computer.
A lightweight radar system has been
developed for the aircraft to detect
and track high-speed targets at great
distances and at all altitudes down
to tree-top level. This information is
fed into the aircraft's central computer
for the accurate launching of missiles
or the firing of the gun.
For close-range combat, the radar
automatically projects the target on
a head-up display giving all the
necessary information on a glass
screen positioned at the pilot's eye
level. The computer also informs the
pilot if the aircraft which he has
detected by eye or radar is a friend
or a foe, and provides information
enabling the pilot to navigate accu¬
rately literally anywhere in the world.
Remotely piloted weapons
With today's advanced military air¬
craft costing around $20 million each,
there is a growing interest in the
development of remotely piloted ve¬
hicles (RPVs) for missions such as
reconnaissance, electronic warfare,
ground attack and air-to-air combat.
RPVs could also be used as decoys
against radar-controlled air-defence

systems, which are becoming Increas¬
ingly more effective and deadly.
Thanks to new technological ad¬
vances, the cost of a low altitude
strike-reconnaissance RPV works out
at about $500,000. What is more,
these pilotless warplanes, that have
already proved their "usefulness" in
both Viet-Nam and the Middle East,
do not need the expensive ejection
and survival systems nor the other
man-orientated equipment necessary
In a piloted aircraft.
Using equipment such as television
cameras and data transmission, an
RPV could be controlled precisely,
and at a safe distance from the target
area, by an operator either in the
launcher aircraft or in a ground control
centre working from television pictures
transmitted from the vehicle.
One of the many new developments
in conventional weapons Is that of
precision guided munitions, or PGMs.
There now exists a whole class of
such weapons, in which are normally
included all those bombs, missiles and
other projectiles that can score direct
hits on their targets at full range with
a high probability of say, greater
than one-half.
According to the design of the
PGM, the target may be a tank, ship,
aircraft, bridge, radar installation,
concentration of armour or troops, and
so on. A PGM may be an air-to-air,
air-to-surface, surface-to-air or surface-
to-surface weapon and may be fired
from an artillery piece, an aircraft, a
ship, a vehicle or launched by an
individual soldier.
Because PGMs can be guided during
flight onto even moving targets they
are considerably more accurate than
unguided weapons. Various homing
devices, based on TV, lasers, infra
red, wire-guidance or radar homing,
have been developed for these
weapons.
PGMs are relatively easy to operate
and they are cheap (at least compared
to the cost of potential targets).
Together with their accuracy, these
characteristics have stimulated con¬
siderable military interest in these
weapons.
Concurrent with the development of
PGMs, significant advances have been
made in such areas as: artificial
sensors for target acquisition; night-
vision equipment; information-pro¬
cessing systems; command and con¬
trol systems: and so on. In com¬
bination, these developments are likely
to make warfare increasingly auto¬
mated. But very little thought has so
far been given to the political, social
and economic consequences of this
type of warfare.
THE NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE
Arms control efforts have
failed to produce any nuclear disarmament
or even to halt the nuclear arms race
EVER since nuclear weapons
were invented, attempts have
been made to justify their possession
a familiar state of affairs In military
technology. To this end, very elabo¬
rate theories of deterrence have been
developed by strategists and other
intellectuals. And dubious beliefs
have evolved about the political and/or
military utility of nuclear weapons the
most common one being that these
weapons actually prevent war.
It is, of course, unprovable that
nuclear weapons have ever prevented
war but many firmly believe that they
did so in the late 1940s and early
1950s. Be this as it may, it is cer¬
tainly no longer true nor has it been
for a long time now that the Soviets
and the Americans are prevented
from fighting each other mainly be¬
cause of their possession of nuclear
weapons.
All theories of nuclear strategy and
deterrence based on massive assured
destruction contain basic flaws. By
their very nature they must. Not only
are the theories often based on
assumptions that defy common sense
and experience such as, political
leaders will always behave rationally,
countries will surrender rather than
use all their nuclear weapons, adver¬
sary countries will negotiate at an
early stage of a conflict, and so on
but they are inhumane, immoral, even
genocidal and they seriously hamper
progress towards disarmament.
Unfortunately, nuclear deterrence
has become so ingrained into the
thinking of politicians, strategists,
military men and the general public,
that it has almost become an article
of faith. We have, so to speak,
learnt to live with nuclear weapons.
Political leaders often subscribe to
the theory of nuclear deterrence not
necessarily because they believe in
its virtue but for reasons of political
expediency. Once new weapon sys¬
tems have been developed, very
strong pressures (by no means all
military ones) rapidly grow within socie¬
ties for their extensive deployment.
But often there is no obvious stra¬
tegic justification for this deployment
and so one has to be invented. And
a convenient rationalization is that
the deployment is necessary "to main¬
tain and strengthen deterrence". In
this way, there has been rationaliz¬
ation about large numbers of new
types of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, nuclear strategic submarines,
intercontinental strategic bombers,
and so on.
It is often said that if one side
were weaker in nuclear weaponry it
would tempt the other side to exert
political pressure and blackmail on
the weaker one. But this does not
affect the argument for negotiated
general nuclear disarmament which
would maintain an equilibrium, and
therefore a feeling of security on both
sides, throughout the disarmament
process.
The public has become lulled into
a false sense of security by those
most often undeniably sincere patriots
extolling the virtue of a balance of
nuclear terror as a fine and sensible
policy. But the advocates of this
theory have become hoist on their
own petard.
A "good" policy for one country is
likely to be seen by others as "good"
also for themselves. If the U.S.A. and
the U.S.S.R. are seen to perceive
that nuclear deterrence is a workable
doctrine then other countries will pro¬
bably come to believe in it too. In
international politics, perceptions are
more important than facts.

Four countries today possess missile-firing nuclear
submarines U.S.A., U.S.S.R., U.K. and France. Above,
three French nuclear submarines "Redoutable",
"Terrible" and "Foudroyant" at a rendezvous on the
high seas. As the so-called doctrine of "mutual
deterrence" escalates, an even more powerful type of
missile-firing submarine is being built. It will carry
24 multiple-warhead missiles with a range of 4,500 miles
and a total of over 400 warheads. Below left, this future
submarine monster, the U.S. Trident submarine to be
launched in 1979. Each Trident will cost $1 .8 billion, nearly
double the annual budget of a country such as Morocco.
Submarines that can fire nuclear missiles have
become the most deadly weapons system in
today's nuclear arsenal. According to SIPRI
Yearbook 1975, "World Armaments and
Disarmament", nearly 100 nuclear-missile
submarines were being operated in 1974 by four
countriesU.S.S.R. (48 submarines) U.S.A. (41)
U.K. (4) France (3). The latest type of nuclear
submarine can carry 16 missiles, each equipped
with 10 to 14 nuclear warheads, and has a
striking power of 160 to 224 warheads, each a
hydrogen bomb three times as powerful as the
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Released
independently after launching from under water
(photos right) the warheads could be directed to
separate targets 100 miles apart and over
1,000 miles away with an accuracy of a quarter of
a mile. As one specialist puts it: "One nuclear
submarine can destroy any country on earth."
Right, three phases in test launching of submarine-based
nuclear missiles. 1. Clothed in air bubbles, a missile
hurtles through the water from its launching tube.
2. Carrying a dummy multiple warhead, missile erupts
from waters of ocean test-range. Nuclear submarine's
extra tall antenna used for tests sticks out of water at

begins its powered flight.

countries is how to dissuade other
countries from acquiring nuclear
weapons which they are very
anxious to do and rightly so without
playing down the importance they
attach to their own.
The fact is, of course, that the
nuclear-weapon states cannot have it
both ways. But it appears that the
political leaders of these countries
are not prepared to declare that, in
today's world, nuclear weapons have
little or no political or military value.
They have probably become too
carried away by their own propaganda
to be able to do so, even though times
have changed.
Throughout this century, disarma¬
ment and the control of armaments
have been more or less permanent
features of the foreign policies of the
great powers. And since World
War II, literally hundreds of interna¬
tional meetings have taken place
mainly in an attempt to control the nu¬
clear arms race between the U.S.A.
and the U.S.S.R. and then to reduce
the number of nuclear weapons in the
arsenals of the nuclear-weapon
powers. But, in spite of so much
talk, virtually no progress has been
made towards either of these ends.
How can this be explained?
A major reason for a lack of pro¬
gress towards nuclear disarmament
is related to the decision taken by
politicians in the early 1960s to aban¬
don attempts at the direct negotiation
of general and complete disarmament
and to work instead for partial arms
control measures. The idea was that,
by this method, it would be possible
to move towards general disarmament
by small steps.
Whereas "disarmament" normally
means a quantitative reduction in total
numbers of existing weapons by the
traditional methods of international
negotiation, leading to a multilateral
treaty, "arms control" normally refers
to negotiated measures leading to the
slowing down (and eventual halting)
of arms races.
In other words, disarmament refers
to the elimination of armaments (either
specific armaments, such as nuclear
ones in the case of nuclear disarma¬
ment, or all armaments in the case of
general and complete disarmament)
and arms control to curbs on acquir¬
ing new weapons.
Slow progress seems to be inherent
in the arms control approach. Arms
control advocates claim that, in a
world of security-conscious sovereign
states, disarmament can only come
about if at all as the end product
of a lengthy process.
The initial stage In this process
involves banning weapons of little or
no military value (such as biological
weapons) and banning weapons from
environments of little or no military
significance (such as the sea-bed,
outer space, Antarctica and so on).
This process, so it is said, will
establish such a degree of mutual
confidence between the powers and
so improve the climate of international
affairs that, in due course, far-reaching
disarmament may be possible.
Confidence-building measures like
arrangements to minimize the risk of
"nonprovocative" weapons, the adop¬
tion of "nonprovocative" strategies,
and so on and tension-reducing
measures like nuclear-free zones,
demilitarized areas, nuclear test bans,
nonaggression pacts and so on are
advocated as measures which may
facilitate the eventual negotiation of
disarmament.
Although disarmament advocates
disagree amongst themselves on the
details of the most desirable general
and complete disarmament plan, most
agree on the urgent need for nuclear
disarmament usually as part of some
broad programme of disarmament.
Arms control advocates often argue
that disarmers exaggerate the dan¬
gers in a nuclear-armed world and,
more importantly, they feel that it is
politically unrealistic to expect signi¬
ficant disarmament to be achieved in
a world organized as ours is today.
In their turn, disarmers argue that
far-reaching disarmament is a politi¬
cally realistic objective (although
admittedly a difficult one to achieve)
in a world of sovereign states because
governments could be persuaded to
disarm by, for example, the pressure
of public opinion. They would then
direct their energies towards disarm¬
ament instead of diverting their atten¬
tion to the negotiation of partial arms
control measures.
An argument often used against dis¬
armament is that even if weapons
were destroyed, knowledge of their
production technology would still
exist and governments could order
their manufacture again at any time.
This is true, but the reestablishment
of an armaments industry would take
time and would be extremely difficult
to conceal.
The risk that weapons will be used
is greatest if they are available for
use at a moment's notice in the heat
of a crisis. Any delay in the outbreak
of war would give more peaceful
methods of settling the conflict a
chance of success.
The record to date is a dismal one.
The only disarmament that has taken
place in the past quarter century is
the destruction of stockpiles of biolo¬
gical weapons by the U.S.A. and
possibly also by the U.S.S.R. The
former has been officially announced,
the latter not yet.
Apart from this, not a single
weapon not even a pistol, let alone
an intercontinental ballistic missile
has been destroyed as a result of an
international agreement. Instead, vast
numbers of weapons conventional,
nuclear and chemical of a bewilder¬
ing variety of types have been devel¬
oped and deployed as fast as techno¬
logical developments will allow.
Furthermore, the international trade
in arms has increased alarmingly and
even the most sophisticated weapons
are now sold in large quantities by
the advanced nations, often even
before they enter the arsenal of the
producing country.
Very little attention has so far been
paid to the problem of controlling and
reducing conventional armaments or
the arms trade, even though the
greatest proportion of world military
expenditure is used to acquire these
weapons. Yet these weapons encour¬
age and add to the violence of local
conflicts and the arms trade is one
way in which the great powers, as
suppliers, become embroiled in regio¬
nal wars involving client states.
So far, seven multilateral treaties
have been negotiated at the Confe¬
rence of the Committee on Disarma¬
ment in Geneva, the main international
forum for disarmament negotiations,
and a number of bilateral treaties have
been negotiated directly between the
U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
The first multilateral arms control
treaty was the Antarctic Treaty (1959)
which prohibits the militarization of
the Antarctic the area is to be used
exclusively for peaceful purposes.
The veteran disarmament advocate,
Philip Noel-Baker, commented that
"while disarming Antarctica, we put
7,000 nuclear weapons in Europe. We
should have disarmed Europe and put
those weapons in Antarctica." But
the Antarctic Treaty was only the first
of a series of arms control measures
which merely banned weapons from
environments in which there is no mili¬
tary interest.
Another treaty of this type is the
Outer Space Treaty (1967) which
controls military activity in space and
26

<![CDATA[
prohibits the placing in orbit round
the earth of any objects carrying
weapons of mass destruction. And
then there is the Sea-Bed Treaty
(1971) which rules out the sea-bed for
the emplacement of nuclear weapons
or any other weapons of mass
destruction.
The intention of the Treaty of Tla-
telolco (1967), to make Latin America
a nuclear-free zone, is a good one.
Unfortunately, the two countries in the
region most likely to acquire nuclear
weapons, Brazil and Argentina, have
not fully acceded to the Treaty and
are unlikely to do so. In their absence,
the Treaty is a dead letter.
Many apologists for the arms control
approach regard the Partial Test Ban
Treaty (1963) as a singular success.
But it has mainly functioned as an
antipollution measure and, as such, it
can be regarded as the first modern
international treaty to control the
contamination of our environment.
No one today doubts that our en¬
vironment would now be considerably
more contaminated with radioactive
material if the U.S.A., the U.S.S.R. and
the U.K. had continued testing nuclear
weapons in the atmosphere and under¬
water.
Although France and China have
not stopped conducting nuclear tests
in the atmosphere (1) they have done
so much less frequently than did the
other three powers. The Treaty may
also have prevented India who has
ratified it from detonating its nuclear
explosive device above ground.
After the Treaty, the U.S.S.R. and
the U.S.A. continued testing nuclear
weapons underground at about the
same rate as they had tested nuclear
weapons before 1963. The Partial
Test Ban has not, therefore, signifi¬
cantly slowed down the nuclear arms
race between the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R.
If it has had any effect at all, it was
to limit the further development of very
large thermonuclear weapons but
military interest in these weapons
waned some time ago. On the other
hand, very substantial progress has
been made since 1963 by underground
(1) In June 1974, France announced that
her nuclear tests In the atmosphere in the
summer of 1974 would be the last of their
kind, and that future tests would be carried
out underground.
testing in improving the yield-to-weight
ratio of nuclear warheads and thus
developing, for example, very small
nuclear weapons; hardening weapons
against anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs);
developing multiple independently-
targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV)
and ABM warheads; and so on.
It is, therefore, difficult to claim
convincingly that the Partial Test Ban
was a significant step towards nuclear
disarmament. Nothing short of a
comprehensive test ban, prohibiting
all nuclear tests, could reasonably be
so described.
There is little doubt that public
concern over the radioactive contami¬
nation of man's environment was the
main factor which induced the U.K.,
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. to agree
to discontinue tests in the atmosphere,
in outer space and underwater.
Public opinion had been aroused
by a series of dramatic nuclear events
prior to 1963, such as the severe radio¬
active contamination of a boatload of
Japanese fishermen by an American
thermonuclear explosion in 1954 in the
Pacific (see "Unesco Courier", Aug.-
Sept. 1967) and the Soviet atmospheric
explosion at Novaya Zemlya in October
1961 of the largest nuclear device ever
exploded in the world a thermo¬
nuclear weapon with an explosive
power equivalent to that of 58 million
tons of TNT.
The fact that the force of public op¬
inion overcame the strong objections
to a partial test ban on the part of
those groups within the nuclear-wea¬
pon powers with vested interests in
nuclear-weapon testing is an object
lesson.
It demonstrates that if 'successfully
mobilized again, public opinion could
compel reluctant politicians to move
towards nuclear disarmament. This
may be the best if not the only hope
of achieving such disarmament.
The other two existing arms control
measures are the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (1968), and the Biological Wea¬
pon Convention (1972) which prohibits
the production of biological weapons
and stipulates the destruction of biolo¬
gical-weapon stockpiles.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty is un¬
doubtedly a fragile instrument. The
Treaty is weak because two nuclear-
weapon powers (China and France),
and many key states with the technical
ability and the nuclear material to
acquire nuclear weapons (Argentina,
Brazil, India, Israel, Pakistan and South
Africa among them) have not asso¬
ciated themselves with the Treaty.
But the most serious weakness is
the imbalance between the obligations
of, and the benefits for, the nuclear-
weapon parties (the U.S.A., the
U.S.S.R. and the U.K.) and those of,
and for, the non-nuclear-weapon par¬
ties. The latter states have substantial
obligations but have, so far, received
very few benefits.
Moreover, the nuclear-weapon par¬
ties have failed to fulfill the few obliga¬
tions under the Treaty which they do
have. In particular, the obligation to
take "effective measures relating to
cessation of the nuclear arms race at
an early date and to nuclear disarma¬
ment" has clearly not been fulfilled.
If the nuclear-weapon parties do not
take their obligations seriously, why,
say the others, should we?
The most obvious next candidates
for multilateral arms control treaties
are a chemical-weapon convention and
a comprehensive nuclear test ban.
Verification is said to be the main
stumbling block in the negotiation of
both of these measures but experience
shows that once the political will to
obtain an agreement exists, verification
problems are easily dealt with. Such
was the experience with the Biolo¬
gical Convention and the Strategic
Arms Limitation agreements between
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
The real reason for the delay in pro¬
hibiting chemical weapons is that they
are of much greater military interest
than biological weapons. Meanwhile,
binary chemical weapons are being,
developed. These weapons contain
chemicals which, although harmless
singly, produce poisonous compounds
when mixed. Mixing occurs either
when the munition is fired or when it
impacts.
The deployment of binary weapons
will make the negotiation of a compre¬
hensive ban on chemical weapons
considerably more complicated. And a
ban not including binaries would be
ineffective. This is a typical example
of the way in which technological
advances can complicate, as time
elapses, the negotiation of arms con¬
trol and disarmament treaties.
In July 1974, the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. signed a Treaty on the Limi¬
tation ôf Underground Nuclear Tests,
banning the underground testing of
nuclear weapons having a yield ex¬
ceeding that of the explosion of
150,000 tons of TNT (150 kilotons).
But this cannot be regarded as a.
substitute for a complete ban on r
27

. nuclear-weapon tests. The very high
threshold of 150 kilotons is not, in
practice, a significant limitation because
most American and Soviet tests during
the past few years have been less than
about 200 kilotons. The Treaty will,
therefore, hardly affect the current
development of nuclear warheads.
The most serious objection to the
Treaty is that it may indefinitely delay
a comprehensive nuclear test ban a
measure most urgently needed tobring
the nuclear arms race under some
control.
The Treaty has, no doubt, a few
positive aspects. It will complicate the
development of new high-yield war¬
heads by both sides. It will also make
it difficult for them to carry out stock¬
pile-sampling, because the existing
large thermonuclear weapons could
not be tested at their full yield. Cessa¬
tion of explosions in the megaton range
may have favourable environmental
effects. It will reduce risks of radio¬
active venting, artificial earthquakes
or tidal waves.
Most important, however, are the
verification provisions. It will be the
first time that detailed information con¬
cerning sites and yield of nuclear wea¬
pon explosions will be exchanged
between the parties. Apart from the
political significance of this procedure
constituting a step towards greater
openness among states, a suitable
verification framework could be created
for use in a possible comprehensive
test ban.
The provisions of the Treaty do not
extend to underground nuclear explo¬
sions carried out by the parties for
peaceful purposes (Article III). This
means that the threshold of 150 kilo¬
tons does not apply to such explosions.
But it is not possible to distinguish
with certainty nuclear tests serving
peaceful aims from those serving mili¬
tary aims.
A mere statement by the testing
state that its intention is "peaceful"
may not be found satisfactory; the
loophole could be taken advantage of
for a new large weapon development,
if at some point in the future this
became necessary.
On the other hand, if the yield limit
of 150 kilotons were imposed on all
underground nuclear explosions, cer¬
tain peaceful applications of nuclear
energy, such as large-scale excavation
projects, would have to be abandoned.
The studies on the possible use of
nuclear explosions to dig a sea-level
Panama Canal indicated that some 300
nuclear blasts with yields ranging up
to 15 megatons would be required. It
has also been estimated that the cons¬
truction by nuclear excavation of the
northern 65 km part of the Pechora-
Kama-Volga canal in the U.S.S.R.
would require about 250 nuclear explo¬
sives with yields of up to 600 kilotons
each, while the yield for any one
"salvo" of charges might attain three
megatons.
The most familiar bilateral agree
ments between the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. are those that have arisen out
of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) between the two powers
these began in 1969 and have been
going on ever since. The first SALT
agreement (SALT I), which came into
force in October 1972, included an
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an
Interim Agreement on offensive wea¬
pons.
A major weakness of SALT I is a
total lack of any restriction on the
improvement of the quality accuracy,
penetrativeness and range of ballistic
missiles and their launchers. The
technological arms race is encouraged
and even legitimized better weapons
can be substituted for those which
become obsolete.
Most significant is the lack of con¬
trol of the number of nuclear warheads
each missile can carry. Since SALTI,
the number of nuclear warheads de¬
ployed by the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
has increased, and is increasing, con¬
siderably.
On 24 November 1974, at their
meeting in Vladivostok, President
Gerald Ford and General Secretary
Leonid Brezhnev agreed that the SALT
negotiators would, from January 1975,
work for a new agreement (SALT II)
under which each side would be limited
to 2,400 stategic nuclear delivery sys¬
tems a net increase on the present
total number deployed. Within this
number each side would be further
limited to a total of 1,320 ICBMs and
SLBMs equipped with MIRVs.
The arms control efforts multilat¬
eral and bilateral over the past 15
years have failed to produce any
nuclear disarmament or even to halt the
nuclear arms race. In spite of this, the
public has been seriously misled into
believing that steady progress is being
made in disarmament.
The main reason for this mistaken
belief is that political leaders habitually
make euphoric statements about the
value of arms control treaties. Each
treaty is signed with much pomp and
ceremony, and to the accompaniment
of speeches full of high-sounding pro¬
mises of bigger and better things to
come. And the preambles and articles
of the treaties usually contain far-
reaching commitments to further prog¬
ress rarely, if ever, followed up.
The political leaders, are, of course,
aware of the almost universal human
desire for a secure and peaceful disar¬
med world and of the considerable
political benefit to be gained from
paying lip-service to this desire. But
perhaps not surprisingly they, and
those involved in negotiating arms con¬
trol treaties, take on a "professional
optimism" which apparently causes
them to convince themselves that
substantial progress is being made.
That may be a psychological necessity
for those involved but it also hampers
progress towards disarmament.

In the last 30 years six
countries (the United
States, the U.S.S.R., the
United Kingdom, France,
China and India) have
developed nuclear weapons,
and at least 20 others have,
through peaceful nuclear
programmes, acquired the
technical knowledge and
nuclear material to produce
such weapons. Below, the

THE NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE 0 A tragic paradox:
peaceful atoms which foster
the proliferation of nuclear weapons
T NTIL a few years ago, most
countries were prevented from
readily acquiring nuclear weapons by
two main barriers one technical and
the other economic. A lack of know¬
ledge of the technical details of
nuclear-weapon design and a lack of
expertise and experience in nuclear
technology in general were virtually in¬
surmountable obstacles to many coun¬
tries, even if they had had the political
desire to produce nuclear weapons.
'<í,^^íí^>s ^;K"^^'fi w;^;;:--:^:v'
Apart from the lack of technical
know-how, few countries, other than
the present nuclear-weapon countries,
could have afforded a nuclear force
without diverting unacceptably large
resources from other activities.
But in country after country these
barriers have become, and are be¬
coming, ineffective. This radical
change has come about because of
the spread of nuclear technology for
peaceful purposes.
Although nuclear energy has mani¬
fold applications in industry, medi¬
cine, agriculture and so on, the main
reason for the spread of peaceful
nuclear technology is related to the
rapidly increasing world demands for
energy. The demand for electricity,
the most versatile form of energy, is
increasing faster than that for other
forms of energy. In many if not
most situations around the world,

( power reactors is significantly cheaper
' than that generated by coal- or oil-
fired power stations.
This is rather dramatically illustrated
by the fact that Iran is buying nuclear-
power reactors even though it has
enormous reserves of oil. The ration¬
ale for this is that it is more econo¬
mical for Iran to use nuclear power
to generate electricity and to sell or
conserve its oil, rather than burn it
in power stations. There are, of
course, other reasons why countries
want nuclear-power reactors to ac¬
quire the option to produce nuclear
weapons, for example but the eco¬
nomic factor Is, in general, the domi¬
nant one.
Few people have a clear im¬
pression of how extensively nuclear
technology has already spread around
the world or how rapidly .it is likely
to continue to do so.
The nuclear-weapon countries were
the first to build peaceful nuclear-
power reactors the U.S.A. and the
U.S.S.R. in 1954, and France and the
U.K. in 1956. The peaceful nuclear
programmes in these countries evol¬
ved directly from their military pro¬
grammes. It is of relevance to the
present-day situation to note that just
the opposite applied to the Indian
nuclear explosion in 1974. This
was entirely a by-product of India's
peaceful nuclear programme and a
relatively inexpensive one at that.
The Fed. Rep. of Germany was the
first country to embark on a purely
peaceful nuclear-power programme.
Its first nuclear-power reactor
went into operation in 1960.
Canada and Italy were next, with
nuclear-power reactors operating in
1962. Sweden and Japan followed in
1963; the German Democratic Rep¬
ublic and Switzerland in 1966 ; the Ne¬
therlands and Spain in 1968; Belgium
and India in 1969; Pakistan in 1971;
Czechoslovakia in 1972; and Argen¬
tina and Bulgaria in 1974. China has
built one or two nuclear-power re¬
actors (in the late 1950s or early
1960s) but to supply electrical power
for its uranium-enrichment plant, as
part of its nuclear-weapon pro¬
gramme.
At the end of 1974, therefore,
20 countries had already installed
nuclear-power reactors. An additional
six countries Austria, Brazil, Finland,
South Korea, Taiwan and Yugoslavia
have their first nuclear-power re¬
actors under construction. And many
others, amongst them Australia, Den¬
mark, Egypt, Hungary, Iran, Israel,
Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Ro
mania, South Africa and Thailand, have
announced plans to acquire power
reactors.
By 1980, if present plans are
followed through, some 30 countries
will have nuclear-power reactors with
a total electrical generating capacity
about 15 times that of the world's re¬
actors in 1970. Looking further ahead,
it is predicted that the 1980 figure
for nuclear generating capacity will
increase more than tenfold by the
year 2000.
From now on nuclear power will
move increasingly into the developing
regions slowly at first, but much
more rapidly in a couple of decades
hence. Argentina, Brazil, India, Pakis¬
tan, South Korea and Taiwan are the
vanguard of this trend.
Cheap energy supplies are vital for
industrialization. In fact, supplying a
source of cheap energy may well be
the main (if not the only) significant
contribution that technology can make
to development. For this reason, the
spread of peaceful nuclear power to
developing regions probably could not
(and should not?) be hindered.
In countries with advanced nuclear-
power programmes Canada, France,
the Fed. Rep. of Germany, Japan,
U.K., U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.large
nuclear industries have been estab¬
lished. Investments in these indust¬
ries already amount to billions of
dollars and are rapidly increasing.
As might be expected, the nuclear
industry is becoming highly competitive
and cut-throat, similar to other multi-
billion dollar concerns, such as oil,
aviation, electronics and so on.
The nuclear industry can be divided
into two sections one designing and
installing power reactors and the other
providing fuel for them. Nuclear re¬
actors normally use uranium, a widely
distributed element, as fuel. Natural
uranium contains two main types of
atom, the isotopes uranium 235 and
uranium 238.
In ordinary uranium, atoms of ura¬
nium 235 occur in the proportion of
only one atom to 140; the other 139
are atoms of uranium 238. But ura¬
nium 238 undergoes nuclear fission
the process that produces the heat
in a reactor which is used to produce
steam tó drive a turbine which gener¬
ates the electricity much less readily
than uranium 235.
Consequently, many reactors use
not natural uranium as fuel but ura¬
nium in which the proportion of ura¬
nium 235 has been increased above
the natural value. The process of
increasing the content of uranium 235
is called enrichment and is, as we
shall see, of importance to the prob¬
lem of nuclear-weapon proliferation.
As uranium "burns" in a nuclear
reactor, plutonium an element not
found in nature is produced as an
inevitable by-product. One isotope of
plutonium, plutonium 239, readily
undergoes fission, as does uranium
235, and therein lies the importance
of plutonium.
Uranium fuel is normally put into
a reactor in the form of cylindrical
metal-clad elements. As the uranium
is used up, plutonium accumulates in
the fuel elements.
After a time, a given fuel element
stops contributing effectively to the
total production of fission energy in
the reactor and is then removed and
replaced with a new one. The spent
element is then sent to a chemical
plant, called a reprocessing plant,
where plutonium is recovered. This is
done because plutonium is a very
valuable material (more so than gold),
required as fuel for future nuclear-
power reactors specifically, breeder
reactors.
But plutonium can also be used for
the production of nuclear weapons.
And this is the crucial link between
the spread of peaceful nuclear tech¬
nology and the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. It is true that the
plutonium has to be separated from
the reactor fuel elements but there
are enough reprocessing plants in the
world to ensure that no country
should have much difficulty in obtain¬
ing access to one.
Nuclear-power reactors produce
relatively large amounts of plutonium.
A typical power reactor (having a
generating capacity of about 500
megawatts of electricity) produces
about 120 kilograms of plutonium
annually. This would, in theory, be
sufficient to produce about 12 nuclear
weapons per year with yields similar
to that of the bomb dropped on Naga¬
saki (equivalent to about 20,000 tons
of TNT).
When nuclear-power reactors are
operated for the production of the
cheapest electricity, the plutonium
they produce is not suitable for the
construction of the most efficient
nuclear weapons because it consists
of a mixture of isotopes. Plutonium
239 is the preferred material for
nuclear weapons.
To obtain relatively pure plutonium
239, the reactor fuel elements have
to be removed from the reactor after
a period of a few weeks rather than
the normal period of 2 to 3 years.

<![CDATA[
Nevertheless, the plutonium normally
produced in nuclear-power reactors
would still be usable for effective
albeit not optimally efficient nuclear
weapons.
In 1975, the world's nuclear reactors
will produce 25,000 kilograms of plu¬
tonium. And in 1980, they will prob¬
ably produce nearly 100,000 kilograms.
By 1980, the world will probably have
accumulated about 350,000 kilograms.
About one-third of this plutonium will
be produced in countries which do
not now have nuclear weapons the¬
oretically, enough for them to have
made 12,000 nuclear weaponsl
Breeder reactors differ from ordin¬
ary reactors in that, by converting
uranium into plutonium, they produce
more fuel than they consume. About
every 10 years double the amount of
fuel initially put in accumulates.
Thus, enough fuel becomes avail¬
able, not only to keep the reactor
operating, but to fuel a new one of
the same size. Because breeder re¬
actors will eventually become relati¬
vely self-sufficient insofar as fuel is
concerned, they are an attractive
proposition since there is likely to be
a scarcity of uranium at economic
prices.
Breeder reactors are being devel¬
oped mainly in France, the Fed. Rep.
of Germany, Japan, U.K., U.S.A.
and U.S.S.R., and they may be¬
come available commercially by
the mid-1980s. It is predicted that
their use will eventually become so
widespread that, in the 21st century,
they will be the main source of elec¬
tricity unless or until they are super¬
seded by a cheaper and more abun¬
dant source of power presumably
solar or fusion energy.
Although the first generation of
breeder reactors will probably use
uranium, the preferred fuel for sub¬
sequent generations will be plutonium.
This will have important consequences
for nuclear-weapon proliferation be¬
cause any country owning a breeder
reactor will have on its territory a
large amount of plutonium suitable for
immediate use in efficient nuclear
weapons.
In summary, any country with a
nuclear-power reactor has on its terri¬
tory continuously increasing amounts
of plutonium suitable for the construc¬
tion of effective nuclear weapons and
the capacity to produce plutonium of
the type needed for the most efficient
nuclear weapons an alarming state
of affairs.
Plutonium can also be produced In
research reactors. These are relatively
small reactors often used by countries
planning to embark on a nuclear-power
programme to train personnel in re¬
actor technology and to give them
experience in reactor operations.
Israel is an example of a country
which has accumulated a stockpile of
plutonium from a research reactor.
About 50 countries now operate
research reactors and so the picture
is more alarming than it appears at
first sight.
This dangerous situation will, in 20
or 30 years from now, become even
more critical when breeder reactors
are widely used. Unless effective
steps are taken to prevent it, we can
look forward to a steadily increasing
number of nuclear-weapon powers. It
is unrealistic to expect otherwise.
Because the technical and economic
barriers to the acquisition of nuclear
weapons are no longer effective at
least for any country with a peaceful
nuclear programme a political barrier
is necessary if an attempt is to be
made to control the proliferation of
nuclear weapons. For many countries,
this political barrier is the Non-Proli¬
feration Treaty (NPT). Of crucial
importance to this Treaty is the ques¬
tion of nuclear safeguards.
Any country with plutonium on its
territory will want to assure itself
that it can account at all times for
almost all of the material. Not only
does plutonium have a very high
monetary value but it is a very toxic
material (a particle of microscopic
dimensions inhaled into the lung can
cause lung cancer).
Moreover, plutonium is frequently
transported by road, rail and sea
between nuclear reactors and repro¬
cessing plants, and between repro¬
cessing plants and plutonium stores.
Thus, at a very early stage in its
nuclear programme, a country will
establish a national control system
or safeguards system based on
modern accounting methods and so¬
phisticated instrumentation. These na¬
tional systems are being constantly
modernized and improved as the
amounts of plutonium to be safe¬
guarded sharply increase.
National systems do not, of course,
assure other countries that plutonium
is not being diverted to military pur¬
poses. For this reason, international
nuclear safeguards are far more
reassuring for other countries than
any national ones. But even with the
best safeguards technology available,
the undetected diversion of sufficient
plutonium for "one-bomb-a-week" pro¬
duction will soon become possible.
For many years now much nuclear
material and nuclear equipment for
peaceful uses has been exported.
Exported nuclear material includes
enriched uranium, mainly used as fuel
for nuclear reactors. So far, only the
nuclear-weapon countries have had
the facilities required to produce en¬
riched uranium on a large scale.
A uranium enrichment plant is an
enormous industrial undertaking, very
costly to construct, and only seven
large plants now exist three in the
U.S.A. and one each In China, France,
the U.K. and the U.S.S.R. At present,
the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. are by
far the main producers of enriched
uranium, each with a virtual monopoly
position in its own part of the world.
But other countries, including the
Netherlands (in co-operation with the
Fed. Rep. of Germany and the U.K.),
Australia, India, Japan and South
Africa, are building, or plan to build,
large-scale enrichment plants.
The uncontrolled dissemination of
uranium-enrichment technology seri¬
ously increases the risk and the
dimensions of nuclear-weapon proli¬
feration since an enrichment plant
gives a country the capability not only
to produce nuclear-reactor fuel but
also the capability to produce the
highly-enriched uranium needed to
trigger a thermonuclear weapon.
For reasons which have not been
made public, uranium 235 is the
preferred (if not the essential) mate¬
rial for efficient triggers for thermo¬
nuclear weapons it seems that plu¬
tonium is much inferior for this.
Exporting countries normally require
that the nuclear material and equip¬
ment supplied, and any plutonium pro¬
duced from this material and equip¬
ment, are subjected to safeguards
against diversion to military use.
Bilateral safeguards treaties bet¬
ween exporting and importing coun¬
tries have been used for this purpose,
but it is now more usual for exporting
countries to rely on the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to pro¬
vide safeguards on exported nuclear
facilities. In fact, one of the main tasks
of the Agency, which was set up in
1957, has been to administer nuclear
safeguards and it has, over the years,
accumulated a great deal of expertise.
The Non-Proliferation Treaty has
added a new and desirable dimension
to international safeguards. Each non-
nuclear-weapon party to the treaty
has undertaken to accept IAEA safe¬
guards not only on imported nuclear
facilities, but on all peaceful nuclear
activities within its territory. :

LETTER FROM HIROSHIMA (Continued from page 19)
flames was unbearable, and then we found another street
which took us to the Sakai bridge. The crowds of refugees
making for this spot were getting bigger all the time. I
began to walk towards the Izumi palace. Bushes trampled
underfoot by those In flight had formed a kind of causeway.
Nearly every tree had been decapitated.
At first everyone had thought that only his or her house
had been hit. It was only when one came outside that
one saw that everything had been destroyed. And yet,
although every building had been demolished, there was no
sign of the craters usually made by bombs. On the other
bank of the river, fires which had seemed to be dying down
sprang up again more fiercely than ever.
Suddenly in the sky above the river I saw a mass of
air of extraordinary transparency sweeping upstream. I
hardly had time to shout "a tornado", when a terrifying
wind was upon us. Bushes and trees began to shake
madly; some were uprooted and tossed into the air from
where they shot down like arrows on to the grim chaos
below. It was as though the image of some fearful inferno
was being projected over the earth.
A moment after the whirlwind had swept past, a kind of
twilight overshadowed the sky. Just then I met my elder
brother. His face looked as If it were covered with a thin
film of grey paint. The back of his shirt was In shreds,
revealing a huge wound that resembled a sunburn.
As we went in search of a boat along the narrow quay
beside the river I sew many people who were completely
disfigured. They were everywhere along the river, their
shadows silhouetted against the water. Their faces
were so terribly puffed up that it was difficult to
distinguish men from women. Their eyes were mere slits
and their lips were monstrously swollen. They were nearly
all dying and their injured bodies were stripped of clothes.
As we passed close to them some called out to us In weak,
barely audible tones: "Give me a little water", or "Please
come and help me".
An agonizing cry pulled me up short. The naked body
of a young man was lying in the river and a few feet away,
crouched on a step, were two women. Their heads seemed
to have swollen in size by half again and their features
were pitifully deformed. It was only by their long hair,
half burned away, that I recognized them as women.
At last we found a little boat and rowed across to the
other side. It was almost dark by the time we reached
the bank. Many people seemed to have been injured on
this side of the river, too. A soldier squatting by the-
waterside asked me to give him a little hot water and
then, leaning on my shoulder, he walked painfully across
the sand. "We'd be better off dead", he said abruptly.
I silently agreed and at that moment, without exchanging a
single word, I knew we both felt the same ungovernable
rage at the senselessness of what lay around us.
A man with an enormously swollen head ravaged with
burns sat at a table drinking hot water from a tea cup.
His face might almost have been made out of black soya
seeds. His hair had been cut off in a straight line on
a level with his ears. Later, when I had seen more burn
victims with their hair like this, I realized that below the
brims of their hats it had all been scorched away.
As darkness fell, the scene became even more hellish.
Everywhere people were calling for water.
Suddenly there was an air-raid warning: somewhere a
siren must have escaped damage. Its screaming rent the
night air. Downstream the flickering glow of the flames
showed where the city was burning.
In the temple district, many badly injured people were
lying everywhere on the ground. There was not even
a tree or a tent to give them shade. We built ourselves
a roof by propping some flimsy boards against a wall and
THE UNITED NATIONS AT AGE 30
(Continued from page 15)
developed a range of political and
operational methods.
Among these, we note the important
role which the quiet diplomacy of the
successive Secretaries-General has
played in promoting the peaceful
settlement of disputes among states.
The United Nations has also succeeded
in imposing some restrictions in the
field of nuclear and other sophisticated
weaponry and in slowing down the
unlimited armaments race. Still, it is a
fact to be regretted that sums in excess
of $200 billion are spent every year
on armaments (see article page 17).
Certainly more remains to be done,
but in the political field one cannot
reasonably accuse the United Nations
of inertia or of not responding with all
means at its disposal to situations
constituting threats to international
peace. Apart from that, we are more
and more aware today that a lasting
peace in this world can be built only
if conditions of social and economic
stability and justice prevail.
International peace ¡s impossible
without social peace. In this respect
the United Nations has an ever
increasing role to play, its endeavours
being supported by the specialized
agencies which are part of the growing
United Nations family.
The United Nations has already gone
a long way towards addressing the
new phenomena affecting mankind In
the present period. Reflecting the
conscience of mankind, it perseveres
in the search for a just order and more
balanced economic relations in the
world of today. It has never ceased
to foster universal respect for human
rights and to condemn discrimination
of every kind.
The fundamental issue with which
the United Nations, and for that matter
any international organization, is con¬
fronted, remains that of the willingness
of its members to implement its
collective decisions. This fundamental
issue will determine in the long run
the success or failure of the United
Nations or of any other international
organization composed of states. Ulti¬
mately, it is all members which share
the blame for the weaknesses or
failures of the United Nations; it is all
members which can claim credit for
its strengths and successes.
Former SecretaryrGeneral U Thant,
when addressing the commemorative
session of the General Assembly held
on the occasion of the 25th anniver¬
sary of the United Nations, declared:
"There are two alternatives before
this Organization: one is that there will
be no moral force in this world, there
will be no declaration of intent to
abide by the Charter nor profession

then crawled underneath. Six of us were crammed into
this tiny space for 24 hours. Two metres away stood a
cherry-tree on which a few leaves still survived. Under
this tree two school-girls had collapsed. Their faces were
scorched and blackened and their skinny backs were
exposed to the sun. They begged for a little water. They
had come to Hiroshima the previous day to help with the
harvest and had thus become two more victims of this
terrible calamity.
The sun was now setting-
Even before sunrise we heard all around us the sound
of prayers; here people seemed to be dying one after the
other. The two schoolgirls died just as the sun came up.
Towards noon there was another air-raid warning. A
droning sound could be heard in the sky. All the time
people were dying and nobody came to remove the corpses.
Helpless and bewildered, the living wandered among the
dead.
By now we could see the devastated main streets. An
empty grey expanse stretched out beneath a leaden sky.
Only streets, bridges and the branches of the river were
still recognizable. In the middle of it all were hideously
mutilated and swollen bodies. Here hell had become a
reality.
Everything human had been obliterated. The faces of
the dead all looked alike, as if wearing an identical mask.
Pain made the limbs of the dying jerk in spasms, in
curiously rhythmic movements, before they finally stiffened
in death. Kilometres of cable and countless fragments of
the poles which had carried them were strewn about,
twisted and tangled. Looking at a tram which had been
upended and burned out in a flash, or a grotesquely swollen
dead horse, gave one the impression of being in the
middle of a surrealist painting.
We crossed a ruined wasteland which seemed endless.
The belt of shattered houses stretched far out into the
suburbs. It was only when we had passed through
Kusatsu that we came to green, unravaged countryside.
The sight of dragonflies in graceful, darting flight over
the green rice-fields moved us profoundly. Then we took
the long and monotonous road to the village of Yawata,
which we reached that night. In the morning we again
had to face our wretched existence. Not only were the
wounded getting no better, but the uninjured were growing
weaker each day, wasting away from lack of food.
Some days later I saw a schoolboy arrive. It was my
nephew who was later to die of his injuries. He was
at school at the moment the bomb exploded, and when
the blinding flash lit up his classroom he hurled himself
under his desk. The ceiling collapsed and buried him but
he managed to get out through a hole, with a few school¬
mates. Most of the children died instantly. My nephew
fled to Mount Hiji with his friends. While climbing the
mountain he kept on vomiting a white liquid. A week after
his arrival in the village his hair began to fall out and after
two days he was completely bald. Already the rumour had
spread that no injured person could survive if he lost his
hair and his nose bled. And yet my nephew was still to
survive for quite some time, despite his serious condition...
Towards evening, I crossed the bridge and set off across
country in the direction of the earthwork which stands on
the bank of the Yawata. A black dragonfly was drying
its wings on a rock. I bathed there, gulping in great
lungfuls of air. Turning my head I could see the foot
of the mountain wrapped in twilight, while the distant
summits still glinted in the setting sun. It might have been
a landscape out of a dream. Above me the sky was
absolutely silent. I felt as though I had only come into
the world after the explosion of the atom bomb.

(A victim of atomic radiation in 1945,
Tamiki Hara committed suicide in 1951)
of faith and commitment to its prin¬
ciples and purposes . . . The other
alternative is for the Organization to
receive stronger and heartier support
from all its Member States, especially
from the mightier ones . . . and for its
Member Governments to act and
behave in such a way as to make
steady progress towards a just, peace¬
ful and prosperous human community
so that this planet may be a safe
place to live in."
And Secretary-General Waldheim, at
a ceremony celebrating the 30th anni¬
versary of the signing of the United
Nations Charter, had this to say:
"We have a clear choice before us
between searching for genuine inter¬
national co-operation to meet our
common problems, or returning to the
narrow nationalism which has brought
so much tragedy and misery to
mankind in this century.
"Today, let us resolve that we shall
take the road of international co-oper¬
ation. If we do, I am confident that
we shall overcome our difficulties and
that this Organization will grow in
strength and authority. For I am
convinced that the United Nations is
still the world's best hope for peace."
This year, on the occasion of the
Organization's 30th anniversary, one
can expect that there will be many
laudatory statements paying tribute to
the United Nations. However, it is not
words but actions that count, and what
is necessary is the political will of
states to support the United Nations
and work together through the world
organization in order to solve the
common problems of mankind.
The question is whether the com¬
munity of nation states has sufficient
courage and determination to make the
United Nations more effective. Much
remains to be done in the world of
today, much can be achieved through
international co-operation by using the
United Nations as an instrument, and
Indeed certain issues can only be
solved with the help of the Organ¬
ization. Perhaps the stringent demands
of an interdependent world will con¬
vince nation states to proceed with
renewed vigour and confidence along
the path which they opened at the
end of the Second World War when
they created the United Nations organ¬
ization.

New education

the Unesco-affiliated International Associ¬
ation of Art, summarizes studies of exper¬
imental and advanced programmes for the
education of painters, sculptors, craftsmen
and designers in 1 1 countries. Sixteen
institutions are described in this issue,
which is based on an international Unesco

Unesco and
the Helsinki Conference
on European Co-operation
Considerable expansion of co-operation
among European countries In all spheres
of Unesco's competence is provided for in
the Final Act of the Conference on Secu¬
rity and Co-operation in Europe, signed by
35 countries in Helsinki, on 1 August 1975.
In requesting the Finnish Government to
transmit a copy of the Final Act to Unesco's
Director-General, Amadou Mahtar M'Bow,
the Helsinki Conference marked the
importance it accords to Unesco's contri¬
bution to European co-operation in the fields
of culture, education, science, information
and environmental protection. On receiving
a copy of the Final Act from Mr. Ralph
Enckell, the Finnish Ambassador to France
and Permanent Delegate to Unesco, the
Director-General said that Unesco is ready
not only to pursue its current regional acti¬
vities in Europe but also to undertake new
ones so as to reflect a consensus of the
countries which participated in the Helsinki
Conference. He recalled the work already
being done by the European Centre for
Higher Education in Bucharest (Romania)
set up by Unesco and the role of the
Scientific Co-operation Bureau for Europe
at Unesco's H.Q. in Paris. In the Final
Act, the Conference declared itself unani¬
mously convinced of the need "to exert
efforts to make détente both a continuing
and an increasingly viable process, univer¬
sal in scope".
UNICEF greeting cards
This year's UNICEF greeting cards, sold
to provide food, medical care and schooling
for needy children in over 100 countries,
are now available at UNICEF sales points
throughout the world. A UNICEF desk
calendar for 1976 with 54 illustrations is on
sale as well as the cards, which offer more
than two dozen designs. This UNICEF
"Mini Card", one of a series of five
designs, reproduces the delightful "Cats",
by Brazilian artist Cesar Villela.
International literacy
awards for 1975
Two Unesco-sponsored international
prizes for outstanding work in literacy
teaching were awarded to educators from
Brazil and Somalia at a special International
Literacy Day ceremony, on September 8,
1975 in Persepohs (Iran). The 1975 Moham¬
med Reza Pahlavi Prize, donated by the
Shahinshah of Iran, went to the Brazilian
philosopher and educator Paulo Freiré, for
developing a method of adult literacy
teaching. The Nadezhda K. Krupskaya
Prize, from the U.S.S.R. Government, was
awarded to Mr. Abdirizak Mahamoud Abu-
kar, for devising a written national language
in Somalia used in large-scale literacy
campaigns. For the Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi Prize, honourable mentions went to
the organizers of literacy . programmes in
Afghanistan, the Arab Republic of Egypt,
Panama and Zambia, and, for the Krups¬
kaya Prize, to literacy teaching organizations
in the People's Republic of the Congo,
India, Iraq and Togo.
Unesco medal for Philae
Unesco has issued a medal to commem¬
orate the dismantling, transfer and recon¬
struction of the temples of Philae in Egypt,
final stage of the international campaign
launched by Unesco in 1960 to save the
monuments of Nubia, threatened by the
waters from the Aswan High Dam (see
"Unesco Courier", Nov. 1974). Above,

head of Isis, the Egyptian goddess to
whom Philae's most important temple is

delphus) one of the temple's builders,
shown protected by Nekhbet, the vulture
goddess of Upper Egypt. Other Unesco
medals already issued feature Moenjodaro
(Pakistan), Venice (Italy) and Michelangelo.
Proceeds from the sale of the Philae medal
will go to the international fund to save the
Nubian monuments. Available in gold (455
French francs), silver (133 F) and bronze
(60 F)> the medal can be obtained from the
Philatelic Service, Unesco, Place de Fon¬
