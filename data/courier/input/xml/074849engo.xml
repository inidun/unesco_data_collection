International Women's

ITALY Etruscan salutation
Throughout 1975, the "Unesco Courier" has devoted this page to works of art depicting
women, as part of International Women's Year. This month, to salute the end of the Year, we
have chosen this Etruscan woman, painted some 2,500 years ago. She was probably a dancer in
a troupe of entertainers who figure in a scene on the walls of a tomb at Tarquinia (Italy). Known
as the "Tomb of the Jugglers", the grave is considered one of the most important of the 6,000
discovered in the last 20 years (thanks to modern techniques) in the famous Etruscan necropolis
at Tarquinia. Over 60 of the tombs have frescoes.

This issue is devoted to the art and
civilization of the Celtic peoples who,
during the last 1,000 years of the
pre-Christian era, established
themselves in a vast area of Europe
stretching from the Danube to Ireland.
Modern scholarship is gradually
piecing together the history of the Celts
and unravelling many of the mysteries
surrounding the relics of their culture.
New disciplines and scientific
techniques are revealing the originality
of Celtic civilization and throwing
fresh light on its extraordinary
contribution to world art. Our photo
shows a remarkable bronze face which
embellished a wooden bucket found
in a grave at Aylesford, Kent (U.K.).
The face was made in the 1st century
B.C., possibly by a British artist who
had been trained in Gaul.

This head, discovered in Czechoslovakia,
was carved in stone by a Celtic artist
in the 2nd century B.C. Note the highly-
stylized face with prominent eyes and
spiralling eyebrows and moustache.
Celtic art was imaginative rather than
representational. "To the [Classical]
Greeks a spiral was a spiral and a face was
a face", wrote Paul Jacobsthal, an
expert on Celtic art, "whereas the
Celts saw the faces as spirals or tendrils..."

builders of the first
European community
THERE are two Celtic periods in
the history of Europe. The first
is that of the ancient Celts, who
flourished in the late Iron Age. These
were the contemporaries of classical
Greece, the Alexandrine kingdoms and
the Roman Empire, which gradually
drove them to the British Isles, where
they retained their pagan beliefs until
about the 5th century A.D.
The second Celtic period is that of
the Christian Celts, their descendants,
who lived in Ireland, Scotland and
Wales. Some of the Christian Celts
returned to Armorica (Romanized
Brittany) from the 5th century onward
and founded a brilliant literary culture
that profoundly influenced the entire
Middle Ages in the West, through
missions led by Irish monks into the
very heart of Europe.
In both cases, these were peoples
of mainland Europe and its offshore
islands, regarded as barbarians by the
Mediterranean peoples who ranked
them with the Iberians of Spain, the
Germanic tribes, the Scythians from
the Steppes, the Dacians of the Car¬
pathian region and the Thracians of
the Balkans.
What made the ancient Celts so
powerful? Firstly, they were highly
skilled in working iron, and had a re¬
markable gift for technical and cultural
assimilation. Secondly, their explosive
population growth and military dyna¬
mism enabled them to swarm out from
the regions between the Rhine and the
Vltava (or Moldau, the Czech river that
flows through Prague) which seem to
have been the cradle of the Celtic
peoples, towards the Atlantic, the
Mediterranean, the Adriatic, the Black
Sea, and even to reach Asia Minor,
where they founded Galatia. And yet,
they had no written language.
The Christian Celts had other
sources of strength. They occupied
large islands that the Romans never
managed to subdue completely; they
committed to writing an oral literary
heritage comparable in stature to the

numents in Metropolitan France), published

Scientific Research, he has directed excavat¬
ions on many sites in France and north¬
western Africa. Author of La Vie Quoti¬
dienne en Gaule (Daily life in Gaul. Hachette,
Paris. 1952) and Paris Antique (Ancient

eminent authority on Greek. Latin and Celtic
written sources for the history of Gaul. He
is currently preparing a work on Celtic art
throughout Europe.
Homeric epics; they developed and
intensified a distinctive civilization in
the areas where they settled, culti¬
vating and preaching an ardent faith
whose ascetic hermits rivalled those of
the "Eastern Deserts"; and they
tenaciously preserved a group of
languages and traditions that are still
alive today.
To the Celts we owe nothing less
than the first great non-Latin literature
in Europe: the Irish and the Welsh
epics (Sagas) in the pagan era, and
the legends of King Arthur and the
Holy Grail and their successors, the
Breton Romances, Tristan, and the lais,
or verse narratives, of Marie de France.
Thus, before the emergence of the
Roman, the Byzantine, the Germanic
and the Slav empires, there already
existed an underlying layer of Celtic
customs and language in Europe,
extending from Ireland to Silesia. Yet,
the ancient Celts never constituted a
nation, nor did they found a State or
an Empire capable of withstanding
conquest by the Romans or by the
Germanic tribes.
They lived in tribes, principalities,
hegemonies and federations based on
the establishment of "clientships" (that
is, winning over and gaining the
allegiance of individuals or groups
belonging to other tribes). Political
unity among the Celts went no further
than that. When they attempted to
settle permanently they spent their
vitality in the conquest of territory and
were weakened when their young men
were drawn from them to fight as
mercenaries by the lure of adventure
and plunder.
In this way a number of Celtic
countries came into being but were
gradually split up and eventually
disappeared. This was the case with
Middle Germany and Bohemia; eastern,
then central and finally western Gaul;
a large part of Spain, where the
"Celtiberian" people was formed;
northern Italy, conquered early on by
the Romans; the Danube region, from
Austria to Yugoslavia, whose Celtic
population dwindled towards the East;
Great Britain and Ireland, where mi¬
grations from continental Europe came
to rest and took root. Finally,
"Gaulish" bands left traces of their
passage in Bulgaria, Greece and Asia
Minor, while Celtic artifacts if not
the Celts themselves travelled as far
as Silesia, southern Poland and the
Ukraine. All this had come to an end
by the dawn of the Christian era,
except in the Atlantic islands.
Greek and Latin authors speak of
the Celts as adversaries. Were not
these the barbarians who had taken
by Paul-Marie Duval
Rome at the beginning of the 4th cen¬
tury B.C., and who sacked the shrine
of Delphi, in Greece, a century later?
They were thus depicted as being all
too easily tempted by the prospect of
booty and the wines of the Medi¬
terranean, proud and courageous, yet
unstable and fickle.
Yet, in reality, Gaul formed a power¬
ful group of tribes that took Caesar
ten years to reduce. Northern Italy
was known as "Cisalpine Gaul" before
becoming Roman, while no Roman
soldier ever set foot in Ireland, nor
were the Romans able to establish
themselves firmly in Scotland. So,
the judgement of the Mediterranean
peoples on their contemporaries, the
ancient Celts, and particularly the
Gauls, needs to be reappraised. Only
linguistic and archaeological evidence
can help us in this task of historical
rehabilitation which has been ad¬
vancing slowly since the last century.
Celtic unity, which can today be
seen to have extended over a vast and
varied expanse of territory, is revealed
in several ways. Firstly, the Celts had
a common language with different
dialects. We know this from Gaulish
inscriptions, from quotations found in
Greek and Latin authors, and from
place-names in all parts of Europe:
London, York, Dublin, Paris, Lyons,
Leyden, Tongres, Bonn, Vienna, Ge¬
neva, Zürich, Bologna, Milan and
Coïmbra are all Celtic names, as are
Singidunum (Belgrade) and Boihae-
mum (Bohemia).
In this way we know hundreds and
even thousands of words, but only
some of them have so far been
explained by comparison with ancient
Irish, Gaelic or Breton, or through
corresponding word forms in the most
closely related dead Indo-European
languages, namely Latin and Germanic.
Fortunately, the linguistic wealth of
medieval Celtic literature is immense.
As literature it also reveals a taste for
the supernatural, a poetry of dreams,
of fairylike enchantment, a quality of
unreality in complete contrast to Medi¬
terranean classicism. These character¬
istics confirm that the Celts have
always shared a common cast of mind.
Today, we can rediscover the ex¬
pression of this mentality in the subtle
and refined art of the ancient Celts,
with their decorated weapons, their
precious ornaments, ceramics, sculp¬
tures, glasswork and coins of original
and singularly "modern" style.
This ancient Celtic art has been
named La Tène after the site where
a hoard of Celtic objects was dis¬
covered on Lake Neuchâtel in Swit- .
zerland. The name La Tène is now

L also applied to the whole of the later
* European Iron Age.
Both graphic and plastic forms of
this art are based chiefly on combi¬
nations of curved lines, plant and
foliage motifs borrowed from Greek
and Italian decorative designs, and the
transformation of these designs into
imaginary figures. These motifs were
subsequently perpetuated in British
and Irish illuminated manuscripts; on
sculpted crosses and steles in Ireland,
and even in some Roman art.
Here again, in this pre-eminently
cultural sphere, we observe the unity
and the continuity of the Celts. The
boldest linear inventions found on
Gaulish coins already reveal a power
of abstraction that. has been a recur¬
rent feature of European art ever since.
The art of La Tène thus resembles
none of the other art forms of
Antiquity. It is extremely refined,
notably in the shapes of its small
objects; it breaks with the symmetry
of classical models, displaying a
freedom of invention which reflects the
Celts' independence of mind and their
constant revolt against conformity.
But it is also rigorous in its combi¬
nations of curves and counter-curves,
often executed with the aid of a pair
of compasses. Abstraction, metamor¬
phosis and the creation of imaginary
beings all played a large part In Celtic
art, as did the magical quality of
objects and decorative motifs.
The originality of the Celts can be
seen also in their religion. They
venerated nature gods: cosmic forces,
rivers, mountains, animals; monsters
such as three-faced deities, the ram-
headed serpent, the stag-horned god,
tiny spirits or demons that one Is
tempted to call elves or goblins;
collective, often anonymous goddesses
(the "Earth-mothers", who were the
forerunners of the Fairies); and
numerous local deities.
Some of these archaic divinities were
assimilated with Roman gods and god¬
desses and, in Christian Ireland, with
saints, thus showing the profound
continuity of mankind's most cherished
beliefs.
Finally, many places still inhabited
today were originally chosen by the
Celts. Most French towns and cities,
for example, are Gaulish in origin.
Whether or not their locations have
been moved slightly in the meantime,
they have always retained their import-
. anee. There is often an unbroken
evolution stretching from the Celtic
oppidum, through the Roman settle¬
ment, to the city of today.
Even if they are no longer aware of
it, the peoples of Europe, whether
Iberian, Latin, Germanic and Anglo-
Saxon, Hungarian or Slav, have all
inherited Celtic ethnic and cultural
features from their ancient past, and
it may well be that, among the forces
of the past revealed to us by modern
science, these could well serve as one
of the bonds cementing a sense of
rediscovered kinship.

WHO WERE
by Anne Ross
I am a wind on the sea,
I am a wave of the ocean,
I am the roar of the sea,
I am a powerful ox,
I am a hawk on a cliff,
I am a dewdrop in the sunshine.
I am a boar for valour,
I am a salmon in pools,
I am a lake in a plain,
I am a spear with spoils that wages battle,
I am a man that shapes fire for a head.
So sang Amergin, the poet of early Irish tradition, as
the invading Goidels triumphantly claimed the land of
Ireland from their divine opponents, the Tuatha De
Danann, "People of the Goddess Danu".
Ox, hawk, boar, salmon, sacred seas and waters,
magic weapons, venerated severed heads. All these are
essential ingredients in the religion and mythology of
the pagan Celts; beliefs which formed a vital part of
their everyday life and did much to bind together tribes
of such wide geographical distribution and ethnic
variation.
The lines also suggest another fundamental belief
found throughout their pagan cults; that of the survival
of the soul after death, and its rebirth in human, animal
or inanimate form time and time again. That this belief
was common to the Celtic peoples is strongly supported

Two stylized faces stare out boldly
from this bronze Celtic brooch,
made about 2,400 years ago. With
its bulbous nose, and dot eyes and
nostrils, the upper face is a fine
example of Celtic grotesque. Lower
face, surmounted by a palm-leaf
motif ending in a lotus bud, is a Celtic
interpretation of a satyr, complete
with pointed ears. The brooch was
unearthed in a Bavarian grave.

One of the earliest known Welsh
poets, who may have lived in the 6th-
7th centuries A.D., Taliesin, originally
born of the goddess Ceridwen, chants
a similar verse, which makes claim to
a long series of rebirths:
Once more transformed,
I was a blue salmon,
I was a dog, I was a stag,
I was a roebuck in the mountains,
I was a stock and a spade,
I was a drill in a smithy.
For a year and a half,
I was a speckled white cock,
Desirous of hens.
The tradition of rebirth and the soul
in animal or insect form still survived
into the present century in Celtic folk¬
lore. People firmly believed that the
spirit could be seen leaving the flesh
in the shape of a butterfly or small
insect, or of a bird which also hovered
near the body or at the window of one
about to depart this life.
Support is given to these literary
records and to modern folk-belief by
the writings of the classics, Greek and
Roman; all the evidence points to a
fervent belief in survival after death,
spiritual and even physical to rebirth
in this world, and a firm footing in the
Otherworld.
This was not the grim, gloomy Under¬
world of Mediterranean belief, but a
place which surpassed the mundane
world in all the pleasures most desir¬
able to the pagan Celts fighting, feast¬
ing, hunting, horse-racing, drinking,
cattle-raiding; listening to tales; making
love to superlatively beautiful women;
delighting in all the simple glories of
nature.
We may well now ask "Who were
the Celts?" "What are our sources
of evidence for them?" "What are the
peculiar elements of their psyche which
made them a distinctive people in the
ancient past and have preserved them
to the present day in the western
fastnesses of the British Isles, and in
Brittany, the Armorica of Caesar's
time7"
Who the Celts were, and when and
where they originated is a subject of
long and continuing controversy
amongst scholars, and is likely to
remain so well into the future. But
the controversy is no longer a sterile
and stagnant one. New developments
in scientific techniques and the applic¬
ation of new disciplines to the old
give a greater measure of proof to
conclusions built largely upon specul¬
ative theory.
The main sources of evidence for
the Celts, their religion, everyday
lives, artifacts and craftsmen are the
testimony of archaeology which prov¬
ides tangible evidence for their culture;
the writings of the Greeks and Romans
(6th century B. C. onwards), hostile
or eulogistic as the case may be;
place-names, personal names and ins¬
criptions that can be shown to be
Celtic; the writings of the early Christ¬
ian Irish and Welsh scribes who pre¬
served for posterity much of the invalu¬
able lore and beliefs of their fore¬
bears.
The folklore of the surviving Celts,
and of areas which were once and
for so long essentially Celtic can also
provide valuable corroborative material
which must, however, be used with
the greatest caution. And now new
factors such as radio-carbon dating
and the use of scientific methods for
detecting material no longer visible
to the naked eye are being marshalled.

thods of linguistic research can all now
assist us in our search for the origins
of the people whom we call the Celts.
The origins of the Celts are, for the
moment then, still hidden in the dim
mists of antiquity. Their reality is
with us in their surviving descendants
whose temperament and personality
still reveal an astonishing affinity with
their early progenitors. And it is not
only amongst those who still speak
an inherited Celtic tongue as their
birthright that we find echoes of the
powerful tribes who, for hundreds of
years, occupied vast tracts of Europe
and Asia Minor and threatened and
dominated all who came into contact
with them.
They have left their mark down to
the present day in many subtle ways
on the countries which developed from
their old tribal strongholds. The
"Gallic temperament" owes much to
the spirit, vivacity, ¡oie de vivre and
artistic perfectionism of the Celts. And
recently, a professor of the beaux-arts
from Hungary said in conversation:
"In Hungary we are all Celts at heart.
Soldiers may come, heroes fall, but
the people go on." That then is
a summary of the Celtic world at the
broadest ends of the spectrum; its
importance is profound in any true
understanding of the subsequent pat¬
tern of European history and develop¬
ment.
Our concern here, however, must
be limited to the traditional concepts
of the Celts; and for this reason we
shall consider them as people who
were highly-developed by 800-700
B.C. and whose fortunes rose to a new
high between 500 and 250 B.C., when
their declining influence and power
began to succumb to, but was not
destroyed by, the rapid rise of Rome
and the imposition of the rules
of the Roman Empire on the greater
part of Celtic Europe. Ireland remained
immune from Roman domination and
this factor makes it an invaluable store¬
house of treasures from the vital, inde-
The manner in which a 3rd century
B.C. Celtic craftsman has depicted '
this face of an eagle-owl comes close
to the techniques of a 20th century
film cartoonist. With a skilful use
of semi-circles, half moons, triangles
and other geometrical shapes he
has created an immediately
recognizable image. The owl forms
part of a massive (one kilo) bronze
handle mount on a large cauldron
discovered in Jutland (Denmark).
The Braa cauldron, as it is known, is
believed to have been produced in
the Bohemian-Moravian region of
central Europe. Its presence in
non-Celtic Scandinavia is one
example among many of the wide
diffusion of Celtic art in Europe.

Celts.
of the pre-Roman
In order to understand anything
about Celtic daily life and spiritual
inclination we must then begin with
the generally-accepted emergence of
the Celtic world as a distinctive culture,
that is round about 700 B.C. This
culture is designated by scholars as
the Hallstatt culture.
This is, of course, a "convenience
term", because it implies that the
culture originated at this mountainous
site in the Salzkammergut of Austria
and that this was the generative area.
This we know was not the case. The
new developments in European prehis¬
tory heralding the arrival of what we
call the Celtic culture manifested them¬
selves all over Europe at roughly the
same time.
But it is the richness and wealth of
material found at Hallstatt in the 19th
century which makes it a useful term
for this early phase of Celtic develop¬
ment. Here, in the remote mountains,
traces both of a powerful aristocracy
and a salt-exploiting labouring class,
all composed largely of the old indigen¬
ous Urnfield (late Bronze Age) peoples
lived and brought about an astonishing
technological revolution, like that of
their fellows in many other parts of
Europe.
Their wealth in this instance was
based upon their exploitation of the
rich salt mines. Salt is a valuable
commodity; its preservative qualities
allow meat and other perishable food
produce to be preserved, ensuring
supplies throughout the lean months
of a northern winter. Its healing
powers must have been recognized
from very early times.
And here at Hallstatt were dis¬
covered the graves of the aristocrats
who now used iron, not bronze, for
their edge-tools and weapons; nobles
who buried their dead in splendid
wooden chambers (the sacred oak was
the most favoured wood) under
mounds, surmounted by a life-size
statue of the departed hero or his
god, or a sacred pillar-stone or ritual
wooden post instead of cremating
them as did their predecessors.
In these carefully-excavated graves
we can see traces of the lives and the
religious beliefs which were to become
so common amongst their descendants,
the "historical" Celts who appear
about 500 B.C. and are known to
scholars as the La Tène Celts. At the
height of their power between this
date and about 225 B.C. Celtic
dominion stretched from the Baltic to
the Mediterranean and from the Black
Sea to the Atlantic Ocean.
To return to the Hallstatt Celts.
Although they come from outside the
historical record we recognize them as
Celts from their material culture which
was to become elaborated and refined
but not substantially changed in the
second, La Tène phase.
The testimony of some of the oldest
European place-names suggests that
Celtic languages were being spoken in
Europe long before the ethnographers
of the classical world commented on
the habits of one of their most distin¬
guished, and certainly their most
powerful barbarian neighbours. Long
in fact before the technological exper¬
tise of the Celts had introduced the
use of iron to Europe north of the
Alps, and achieved what we may,
perhaps, call the first great Industrial
Revolution.
We cannot say with confidence what
gods these Hallstatt Celts worshipped,
but the existing evidence suggests that
they differed little from those of their
descendants, the La Tène Celts. The
increasing archaeological evidence for
aspects of pagan Celtic religion having
originated far back in prehistory
supports the likelihood that they had a

This immense horse (left) hewn through the turf
into the chalk of the Berkshire Downs (U.K.)
measures 110 metres from tail to nostrils. Known
as the "White Horse of Uffington", it lies near
an Iron-Age hill-fort. It strikingly resembles
the stylized horses depicted on some ancient
Celtic coins(See pages 38-39).
Dogs, natural and supernatural, had a special significance for
the ancient Celts. Cu Chulainn ("Hound of Culann") the great
hero of an Irish epic, won his name by slaying the savage dog
of another legendary figure, Culann the smith, and then
perished for breaking the taboo against eating a dog's flesh.
Dogs were also companions of the deities and guardians of the
Otherworld. Even today Celtic folk tradition abounds in stories
of supernatural malevolent dogs, helpful dogs and enchanted
dogs. Above, bronze leaping dog (14 cms long).

renowned Druids themselves.
The honour which they accorded to
the dead in the form of burial by
elaborate ritual, including in the grave-
goods some of the finest work of
their craftsmen superbly fashioned
weapons and personal ornaments, pots
of fine artistry, perhaps filled with ale
for the thirsty traveller on his long
journey to the Otherworld; vessels of
metal, and even joints of pork the
favourite food of the Celts all these
are indicative of the later widespread
Celtic veneration of the ancestors and
the cult of graves. These they
believed to be entrances to the much-
desired life beyond death.
Their four-wheeled wagons the
status symbol of the aristocrats were
buried with them together with their
horse-gear. Indeed, all that they
would require in the next existence
was provided for them. The later
Celts replaced the wagons by the light,
two-wheeled war chariot as their
outward sign of grandeur. The skilful
craftsmen who were accorded a high
place of honour within the rigid struc¬
ture of Celtic society in fact the smith
was regarded as semi-divine, pos¬
sessed of supernatural powers made
vehicles of a delicate, but hardy
elegance. i^
The ancient Celts regarded the boar as the supreme beast for
the chase and food fit for gods and heroes. They also venerated
it as an Otherworld, magical animal. Below, trio of bronze boars
(1st cent. A.D.) was found at Neuvy-en-Sullias, Loiret (France) ;
the centre one is a nearly life-sized portrayal. Now in the Musée
Historique de l'Orléanais, Orléans (France) they rank among the
finest specimens of Gaulish animal sculpture.

k These skilled artisans learnt to heat
and shrink the iron tyres onto the
spoked wooden felloes of the wheels,
and to create transport both practical
and pleasing to the eye, fit for the
proud Celtic noble and his well-bred
companion, the charioteer. These light
vehicles were drawn by two smallish,
specially-bred ponies which were
attached to a yoke at the end of a
long, and probably squared pole.
The nature of Celtic society, which
was highly aristocratic as we have
seen, gave employment to craftsmen
of all kinds and their assistants, and
the patronage and largesse of the
powerful nobles and their families
ensured a ready supply of artists and
specialists of every kind.
Not only were the structurally
simple, but no doubt elaborately
furnished and decorated houses of the
patrons to be built and furbished.
Schools of itinerant craftsmen also
seem to have hired themselves out for
the purpose of creating hill-forts so
much a feature of Celtic life and
ritual. They adorned the shrines and
created superb vessels and ornaments
not only for the use and adornment of
the chieftains and their wives, but for
the ritual of gift-giving between power¬
ful families within and outside the
native culture in order to seal bonds
of friendship and promises of peace
and allegiance.
All the sources of evidence for the
Celts thus point to a highly-stratified
society which was divided into three
main classes; the priests, poets,
prophets and noble warriors; the free
craftsmen and farmers; and the great
unfree the people who made possible
the rich lives of their social superiors.
But all came within the intricate and
ancient structure of Celtic law, the
oldest and most complex legal system
in Europe, and one with which the
Romans had to come to terms and
make some compromise. These laws
left none without his rights, un¬
protected, no matter how humble his
circumstances unless, having commit¬
ted some serious crime, he was banned
from attending the sacrifices, disowned
by his tribe and compelled to live the
desperate life of an outlaw.
The Roman use of the term barbarian
is an unfortunate one; for us, today,
the term connotes a picture of a wild
savage, deprived of the benefits of
civilization. For the Romans the word
simply meant someone who was not
a Greek or a Roman. Even the elegant
Etruscans were barbarians in the eyes
of the classical world.
The Celtic houses, different though
they were from Roman needs and
taste, were fully suitable for people
whose everyday lives were spent in
hunting, cattle-raiding, fighting, manag¬
ing the land and in religious observ¬
ance for the beliefs and deities of
the Celts were one of the great
binding factors amongst them. The
Romans preferred the quiet gossip of
the forum, the leisurely elegance of
the bathing establishments, the exotic
repast, the impersonal worship of the
official gods.
The thatched houses of their Celtic
neighbours were often surprisingly
large; they provided adequate comfort
and shelter for those tired from a long
day of activity in the open air. The
simple, low tables were sufficient for
the plain but plentiful food and copious
potent ale of the aristocratic warrior,
returned from the skirmish or the hunt.
High, graceful walls of impeccable
masonry and shimmering mosaic floors
were not missed when the eye could
delight in the beautiful metal wine
flagons and goblets, the comforting
central fire flickering on the exquisite
designs and the marvellous workman
ship of the skilled Celtic artists and
craftsmen. The warm flames reflected
the superb weapons and personal
ornaments of the vain, feasting nobles,
and the richly-decorated shields which
were never far out of reach of their
touchy owners.
Personal rivalry and the unceasing
search for distinction amongst fellow-
warriors lent a pleasant sense of
potential danger and the possibility of
sudden single combat the favourite
method amongst the Celts of settling
disputes to the comfort of the simple
fare.
And there was little need for exotic
entertainment when the meal was over,
such as was necessary for jaded
Roman appetites. The noble warriors,
their lord and guests for hospitality
was, and still is almost a religious duty
in the Celtic world would settle back
and listen to the music of the lyre,
to the pleasing voice of the bard
(poet) singing or reciting, commemorat¬
ing the feats and prowess of long dead
heroes, telling tales of the gods, and
praising the generosity and high
qualities of the lord of the feast.
These things were fitting and
appropriate to the temperament of the
Celts, their geographical situation and
their chosen, traditional way of life.
The fact that they differed from Medi¬
terranean taste and custom did not,
on that score, render them barbarous,
or the people barbarians.
Certain aspects of Celtic religion
did indeed strike the Roman world as
barbarous. Amongst these was their
custom of head-hunting, their fervent
human sacrifices, and the total power
of their priests, the Druids. Old Irish
tradition tells us that at an assembly
or feast no man might speak before
the king; but the king himself must be
silent if the Druid wished to make
utterance.
SALTY CELTS
OF HALLSTATT
Right, view of Hallstatt, near
Salzburg (Austria). This little town
at the foot of the Salzbergtal, a
mountain where salt has been
mined since antiquity, gave its
name to the first main period of
the Celtic Iron Age (700-500 B.C.).
In 1846, the director of the Hallstatt
salt mines, George Ramsauer,
discovered a vast ancient burial-
ground. Ramsauer worked on the
site for 17 years and personally
opened almost 1,000 of the 2,500
tombs, bringing to light finds of
major archaeological importance
which proved the existence of an
early iron-using Celtic culture.
Weapons, tools, jewellery, bridles
and war-chariots, all remarkably
well preserved, revealed the skill of
Celtic metal-founders and smiths.

HELMETED WARRIOR
This life-sized sandstone statue
of a warrior is helmeted but
otherwise unclad except for a belt
girdling the waist. Dating from the
5th century B.C., it was
unearthed in 1963 near Stuttgart
Germany (Fed. Rep.). The
statue once stood atop a grave
mound containing 16 burials but
was eventually dislodged and was
found lying broken on the
mound's perimeter. Below right,
a reconstructed burial mound at
Tübingen, Germany (Fed. Rep.).
The Celts believed in their gods and
in the powers of the Otherworld to
such an extent that religion was an
integral part of their daily lives. And,
although each tribe worshipped its own
gods apart from a few elevated
deities who seemed to be venerated
over a wide area and told its own
tales of their origins and adventures,
there is an overall unity in the religion
which can be detected from all the
sources of evidence at our disposal.
The tribal god was father to his
people, their provider and protector,
leader in battle and host at the Other-
world feast. The king must emulate
the god in all things. He must be
physically unblemished; his rule must
bring truth, prosperity and good
government to his people.
The mate of the tribal god was the
mother of her people. She was
concerned with the fertility of the stock
and the people and with the tribal land
where she stayed if the tribe, led by
its chief god, moved. There she
remained bound to the earth she
nurtured, facing an invading force with
her magic powers and her alternating
divine beauty and excessive ugliness.
She must be propitiated or destroyed,
for the Celts did not believe their
divinities to be incapable of death.
Over and above these was a wealth of
deities of all kinds and local spirits,
guardians of sacred wells or venerated
groves.
This common religion, widespread
Druidic priesthood which took some
20 years of training to achieve, the
common languages, the archaic legal
system, the delight in genealogy,
history, mythology, poetry, and the
intense cultivation of oral learning all
these things bound together the far-
flung tribes into a people which can
be recognized by archaeology, by the

writings of the Greeks and Romans,
and by their own later records of the
ancient oral tradition of their forebears,
as Celts.
Unlike the Romans, the Gauls wore
trousers and cloaks, suited to their
equestrian tastes; the Irish wore tunics
and cloaks. The Celtic ¡deal was tall,
blond, blue-eyed, strong of body, bold
of spirit. And this indeed is the way
in which the artists of their classical
opponents portrayed them, passionate
in the attack, proud and scornful in
defeat and subjection.
The Celtic story is a long and
intricate one, and the end has yet to
be written. The ancient Celts did not
care to commit their learning and
beliefs to writing; they used Greek
and Latin for their business dealings.
This cultivation of the memory has
survived in Celtic-speaking areas to
the present day where the greatest
delight is still in the recitation of the
ancient tales and ballads, not learned
from books, but handed on from one
generation to another down the long
centuries by word of mouth.
The finest early Irish epic is the Tain
Bó Cualgne, "The Cattle-Raid of Cual-
gne". It is concerned with the rivalry
of the goddess-queen Medb and her
husband Ailill over the possession of
a superb divine bull, the Donn of
Cualgne, and the warfare and disasters
which result from this conflict. Ver¬
sions of this ancient tale can still be
heard in the Outer Hebrides, told by.

Horse lovers of the Iron Age
To the Celts, the horse was not
only a beast of burden and mount
for the hunt but also an animal
they associated with several of
their deities. Figures of horses and
their portrayal on Celtic coins and
all kinds of metalwork demonstrate
this respect for horses. Above, a
magnificent bronze "cult cart"
(1st-2nd cent. B.C.) discovered at
Merida, Spain, on which a
mounted Celt hurtles in full cry
after a boar. Celtic metal
craftsmen often produced ornately
decorated harness fittings like
those shown at right. Discovered
at the famous Celtic Iron-Age site
of La Tène, in Switzerland, this
reconstituted harness is now in the

. or the antiquity from which it has
sprung.
One of the passages from the Old
Irish tale itself will do much to sum
up the Celtic ideal of heroism and
beauty in the description of the youth¬
ful hero Cu Chulainn, bathed and
adorned after violent battle, as he
appeared to those in the court of his
uncle, King Conchobar. Cu Chu¬
lainn was the son of the pan-Celtic
god Lugh (Lugus) and the king's sister
Deichtire, the hero par excellence of
the ancient Celtic world.
"Beautiful indeed was the youth who
came thus to display his form to the
hosts, Cu Chulainn. Three kinds of
hair he had, dark next to the skin,
blood-red in the middle and hair like
a crown of red-gold covering them.
A hundred bright crimson twists of red-
gold red-flaming about his neck.
Seven gems of brilliance in each of
his eyes. His dress for assembly that
day was a fair mantle, well-fitting,
fringed, five-folded. A white brooch
of white silver inlaid with gold over
his white breast, as it were a bright
lantern that men's eyes could not look
at for its brilliance and splendour. A
tunic of silk next to his skin, bordered
with edges and braidings and fringes
of gold and of silver and of white
bronze. A splendid dark-purple shield
he bore with a rim of pure white silver
round it. He wore a golden-hilted
ornamented sword at his left side. In
the chariot beside him was a long grey-
edged spear together with a sharp
attacking dagger, with splendid thongs
and rivets of white bronze. He held
nine heads in one hand and ten in the
other and these he brandished at the
hosts."
"Nine heads in one hand and ten
in the other." The Celts not only
decapitated their enemies. They wor¬
shipped the severed human head to
such an extent that it may be said to
symbolize pagan Celtic religion to the
same extent as the Cross epitomizes
Christianity. In one of the stories of
the Welsh Mabinogion concerning
Bran, a giant being whose divine
origins are clear, his head, after it has
been severed from his body on his
own request, remains fresh, an
excellent companion, lord of the Other-
world feast, the dispenser of the food
and drink of the gods.
The literature of Ireland received
written form earlier than did that of
Wales, under the aegis of the Christian
Church, a Church which in Ireland was
unrivalled in its austere devotions, but
having at the same time a deeply-
rooted love of its native background,
its Celtic language and traditions.

able in both the Irish and Welsh

How the Irish Christians managed to
accommodate this pagan past to their

illustrated by the words of the scribe
who committed the Táin Bó Cualgne

the 1st century B.C. to writing. He
ends his narrative thus:
"A blessing on every one who shall

written down this story, or rather this

probable, others improbable; while still
others are intended for the delectation
of foolish men."

P's and Q's of the Celtic language
The Celtic language is one of the great group of languages known as Indo-European,
believed by many philologists to have originated somewhere between the Balkansand
the Black Sea. For reasons unknown to us, but which probably included external
pressures from people in neighbouring regions, together with ecological factors,
a great dispersion of these peoples began; specialists in philology are now taking
the dispersal of the Indo-Europeans back to about 2,300 B.C.
With the widespread movements which included all of Europe, apart from the
Finnish, Hungarian and Estonian languages (Finno-Ugrian family of languages)
and that of the Basques, the once-common tongue became differentiated to gra¬
dually form the distinctive European languages of later history. Sanskrit is the
most easterly representative of the old Indo-European speech. The Celtic languages
are very archaic and, like the social structure, have preserved much of the older forms.
There are three distinctive Celtic languages, or branches of the Celtic tongue.
The first and probably the most ancient is that known to linguists as Q Celtic, or
Goidelic, modern Gaelic. This branch preserved the original Indo-European ovsound
as q, later becoming k in sound, but written as c.
This is the branch of Celtic which was spoken and later written in Ireland and
introduced into Scotland in the late 5th century A. D although it may, of course,
have been known there already. It also reached the Isle of Man (in the Irish Sea between
Ireland and England) where it is still spoken traditionally by some of the oldest
members of the community.
There are some traces of it on the European Continent, but in general it would seem
to have been the second branch, known as P Celtic or Brythonic or Brittanic, that
was the common Celtic language of the Continent of Europe, and Britain until after
the Anglo-Saxon settlements gradually displaced it. After that it was the language of
Wales and Cornwall, from where it was re-introduced to Brittany from the end of
the 5th century on.
In Goidelic, for example, the word for head is cend (modern Gaelic ceann) ; in
Brythonic penn. In Goidelic the word for son is mac; in Brythonic map or ap.
The third and most enigmatic branch is that known as Pictish. The Picts are
mysterious Celtic peoples who, from historical times at least, occupied Scotland
north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus. Their language is known principally from
lapidary inscriptions in which the Celtic element is recognizable but which, like their
culture and highly-individual art style (Celtic though it indubitably is) still leaves
the problem of the Picts unresolved anda subject of hot controversy amongst scholars.

THE THREE FACES
OF CELTIC WOMAN
by Jean Markale
THROUGHOUT the ages every
society has tried to define the
relationship between man and woman,
as a couple and also as members of
the prevailing social structure. To do
so society has given each a specific
place, which varies a good deal
according to the customs and traditions
of different peoples.
The social structures of the Celts
who include the ancient Gauls, the
Irish, the Britons from Britain who later
became the Welsh, and the Bretons
of the Armorican peninsula (Brittany)
were those of all the early Indo-Euro¬
pean peoples. Society was patriar¬
chal and men held first place.
But when we examine legal texts
and historical, literary and mythological
evidence, it is surprising to discover
the high status women were accorded
JEAN MARKALE, of France, is a noted au¬
thority on Celtic civilization. Writer and specialist
in classical literature, be has produced many
programmes on the Celts for French radio and
television and has published numerous books on
aspects of Celtic history and civilization. These
include Les Grands Bardes Gallois (The Great
Welsh Bards; Falaize. Paris 1956). Les Celtes
(The Celts. 1960). L'Épopée Celtique d'Irlande
(The Celtic Epics of Ireland. 1971) La Tradition
Celtique en Bretagne Armoricaine (The Celtic
Tradition In Armorican Brittany, 1975), all pub¬
lished by Payot. Paris. His latest book. Le Roi
Arthur et la Société Celtique (King Arthur and
Celtic Society) will appear shortly. Jean Mar-
kale's study on Celtic women, La Femme Celte,
was published this year In English as Women
of the Celts (Gordon Cremonesi, London).
among the Celts compared with some
other ancient societies especially
those of the Mediterranean. As regards
marriage customs, however, close
analogies exist between Celtic usages
and those of ancient India.
All Mediterranean peoples, particu¬
larly the Greeks and Romans, kept
their women in a permanent state of
inferiority. In contrast, the Celts
conferred on them rights of which
women in western Europe were still
deprived during the puritanically-
minded periods of the 19th and 20th
centuries.
There were various reasons for this
special feature of Celtic society, but
one of them stands out: the Celts who
invaded western Europe about the
5th century B.C. were few in numbers
and were essentially an intellectual
and warrior élite. In the territories they
occupied they found populations who
were much more numerous; on these
the Celts imposed their culture, their
language, their religion and their tech¬
nical skills. From them In turn they
took certain customs, especially those
concerning relationships between indi¬
viduals.
The very special status granted to
women which we see reflected in the
patterns of Celtic civilization were thus
inherited from the peoples who had
settled long ago in western Europe.
What strikes one forcibly is the
relative degree of independence en¬
joyed by Celtic women in relation to
their menfolk. Women could own
property such as everyday objects,
jewellery and cattle. The Celts allowed
personal ownership of goods side by
side with collective ownership of land.
So women could use their own goods
as they wished. They could part with
them if they felt so inclined, or acquire
others by purchase, in return for ser¬
vices or as gifts. When she married,
a bride kept her personal possessions
and took them back if the marriage
were later dissolved.
Celtic marriage was in any case a
flexible institution, based on a contract
that was not necessarily lifelong.
Women chose their husbands freely
at least in theory, for parents some¬
times wished to arrange marriages for
economic or political reasons. But
even in such cases the girl could air
her views on the subject.
Within the marriage everything
depended on the economic situation
of the two partners. If the woman
owned fewer goods than her husband,
the latter managed the household
affairs without reference to his wife. If
the fortunes of both partners were
equal the husband was obliged to
secure his wife's consent to his deci¬
sions. Finally and this is exceptional r.

VIVE LA FEMME!
Women were accorded high
prestige by the Celts, and
female divinities played a
major role in their mythology.
The striking head of a
woman (3) was carved in Gaul
some 2,000 years ago. Celtic
artists portrayed the goddesses
in many guises. The 32-cm.
high statue (1 ) represents the
Celtic goddess Epona,
protectress of horses. She
was widely evoked in Gaul and
later throughout the Roman
Empire, where she was adopted
by the Roman cavalry. The
Celts believed in the magical
qualities of the number three.
The three-fold mother-
goddess (2), carved on a stone
stele from Burgundy (France)
was concerned with fertility,
childbirth and sometimes war.

W woman owned more property than her
husband it was she who ran their
household affairs, without even asking
her husband's opinion.
Historical records and old epic
poems have left us some striking
examples of such situations. They
illustrate eloquently the extent to which
women succeeded, in a patriarchal
society, in maintaining a certain pre¬
dominance and an incontestable moral
authority.
Equally important was the fact that
the wife never joined her husband's
family when she married. She con¬
tinued to belong to the family into
which she was born; the price that the
suitor paid to purchase his wife was
a sort of compensation given to her
family. And the woman returned to
her family if the marriage ended in
divorce.
In certain cases especially when
the husband was from another region
the new family created by the marriage
was attached to the wife's family; the
children born of it inherited exclusively
from their mother's side.
The same applied to the royal houses
where sovereignty could be transmitted
through the mother, or through the
maternal uncle. Irish literature and
European literature of Celtic inspi¬
ration provide notable instances of this
practice of making heirs of the off
spring of the mother's brother. The
most famous example is that of Tristan,
the hero of the medieval legend of
Celtic origin. He was the heir of his
maternal uncle, King Mark.
Outside marriage a sort of concubi¬
nage existed, regulated by very strict
customs. In Ireland this lasted a long
time, even into the Christian era. A
man could take a concubine whether
he was married or not. If he was
married he could do so solely with
the consent of his legal wife; but in
any case the concubine installed
herself in his home only after he had
made a contract with her.
The contract's terms included com¬
pensation for herself and for her
family, and she undertook to stay
exactly one year to the day. At the
end of the year the concubine could
regain her freedom unless she made
another contract with the man for the
same period.
This somewhat strange custom,
which has been called "yearly marriage"
or "temporary marriage", had the merit
of safeguarding the woman's freedom
and independence. She was not an
object bought one day and abandoned
the next; she was truly a person with
whom a contract was made. And if the
contract was not respected the con¬
cubine could appeal to a judge chosen
by herself among the wisest men of
the community. These were generally
the druids, who were legal advisers as
well as priests.
The marriage contract itself was
essentially only a provisional agree¬
ment that could be broken at any time,
so normally divorce was an extremely
easy matter. But if the husband decid¬
ed to abandon his wife he needed
serious grounds for doing so. If there
were none, he had to pay a heavy
compensation, exactly as in the unjus¬
tified breaking of any contract.
On her side the wife had the right
to leave her husband if he treated her
badly or kept a concubine in the house
whom she disliked. One well-known
example is that of a druid who wanted
to bring a concubine into his house
though his wife objected. When he
persisted, his wife threatened to
divorce him. As she owned most of
the couple's fortune, the druid thought
twice about it and finally gave up his
concubine.
Though it was in fact usually the
men who wanted to dissolve the
marriage, women were also perfectly
free to do so. Divorce could be vir¬
tually automatic, by a sort of mutual
consent. When a couple separated,
the wife took back her personal goods
and also received her share of all that
the household had acquired during
the marriage.

This meant that the wife suffered
neither economically nor morally, for
divorce was in no way linked to the
idea of blame. It was simply a contract
that had become null and void, and the
divorce merely recorded this fact.
The problem of children of the
marriage naturally raised difficulties.
In principle, the children belonged to
their father's family; this meant that
they too were protected against any
injustice, for family solidarity worked
in their favour and they were never
abandoned.
They also benefitted from the special
Celtic custom of fostering, whereby
children were sent to learn manual,
domestic, intellectual or martial skills
in another family. This also consider¬
ably widened the framework of family
life by creating links between the child
and his adoptive parents.
Children could inherit from their
mother as well as their father. Daugh¬
ters also had their part in the inherit¬
ance, though their share was slightly
less than their brothers'. But on the
whole, in the historical eras (i.e. from
the 5th century B.C. to the 12th century
A.D.) in Ireland, in Welsh Britain and
in Armorican Brittany," Celtic society
seems to have done much to protect
woman's rights and dignity, including
her moral authority.
Examples abound of women who
attained power and played a leading
role in public life. Boudicca and Car-
' timandua, for instance, were British
queens who became oustanding figures
through their natural gifts of wisdom,
daring and ability to command.
Basically, the exceptional status of
women in Celtic societies comes from
the Celtic view of woman as a mys¬
terious creature, attractive and re¬
doubtable at the same time, and
possessor of the power of giving life.
The entire Celtic tradition, Welsh, Irish
and Breton, emphasizes the sovereign
quality of women.
The Irish epics, first set down in the
9th century A.D., show us an unusual
person, Queen Medb, the legendary
queen of Connaught. She incarnates
this sovereign quality and transmits it
not only to her husband, King Ailill, but
also to her numerous lovers to whom,
as the ancient texts charmingly say,
she was "generous with the friendship
of her thighs".
The descriptions given by the auth¬
ors of the Irish epics are corroborated
by the testimony of the Greek and
Roman writers of antiquity, who were
deeply impressed by the formidable
aspect and the burning energy of
Gaulish women, always ready to join
in a fight to defend their own and
their husbands' rights even taking
part in the battles, like veritable
furies.
The branch of medieval European
literature known as the Arthurian
cycle (from the name of the legendary
King Arthur) is unquestionably Celtic
in origin. It has bequeathed to us
feminine characters who are strange
in behaviour and unusual in their
degree of importance. King Arthur's
wife 0ueen Guinevere (which the old
Welsh texts write as Gwenhwyfar,
meaning "White Phantom") is perhaps
the model of these women who incar¬
nate the idea of sovereignty.
Guinevere is at the very heart of the
Arthurian universe. Through her
beauty and her talents she helps the
knights of Arthur's court to display
their, prowess and gallantry. Sir Lan¬
celot admits that all his valour comes
to him from his love of Guinevere.
And how is one to intepret the fact that
Queen Guinevere is repeatedly carried
off by mysterious warriors, except by
their wish to possess the power the
queen represents? In all the Arthurian
romances Queen Guinevere is pre¬
sented as the central figure of the
court, a sun whose rays illuminate the
knights, who can only live with the
approval she gives them in reward for
their feats of valour.
Like most of the heroines of Celtic
legends, Guinevere is a kind of echo
of an ancient sun goddess. In all the
Celtic languages the word for sun is .
feminine and that for moon is mascu- r

kline. Woman is the Sun, so we must
infer that in ancient times the Celts or
their predecessors in Europe worship¬
ped a female solar divinity. We find
the face of this goddess in Yseult, the
wife of King Mark, and heroine of the
story, known the world over, of the
tragic love affair she had with her
husband's nephew, the young and
handsome Tristan.
The legend of Tristan and Yseult
originates in Ireland, where we find it
in an archaic form that strikingly
illustrates the role of woman as postu¬
lated by the ancient Celtic peoples. It
is by no means a banal love story.
According to the Irish archetype, which
features Diarmaid and Grainne, it is
Woman, Grainne or Yseult, who com¬
pels the man to love her. It is she
who leads him on, driven by her
intense determination to escape for
better or for worse with the man she
loves.
Her feminine daring and her com¬
pelling wish to lead the man into a
passionate love affair have come down
to us in a very watered-down version
of the story of the love philtre that Tris¬
tan and Yseult drink unawares. In
reality this famous love potion is a
disguise for the woman's unshakable
and almost superhuman determination.
She wants to compel the man to love
her despite himself, at the risk of losing
his honour and even his life.
This literary reference leads nat¬
urally into Celtic mythology, where the
face of Celtic Woman has been
preserved in its purest form. One
theme recurs time after time: that of
the supremacy that must be conquered
not only by force but through love.
Many Irish and Breton legends tell
a story more or less on these lines:
a group of young men find themselves
in a desert, dying of thirst. An ugly
old woman offers them water on
condition that one of them will kiss her.
They all refuse except one, usually the
youngest. He overcomes his repug¬
nance and when he has kissed the
cheek of the hideous old crone, she
suddenly turns into a beautiful young
girl who says: "I am Sovereignty
incarnate. By your gesture of affection
you have won me."
This theme is found in many parts
of the world, but the Celts have given
it a special significance, and one that
does not alter its symbolic meaning:
the Sovereignty embodied by the old
woman represents a waning authority.
It needs to be regenerated; but only
a young man can restore its youth.
From this regeneration a new era will
arise, peaceful and prosperous for the
kingdom.
Many myths and legends have this
meaning and it explains, at the deepest
level, the famous Quest for the Grail,
22
whose primitive version, completely
pagan, not to say druidical in spirit, is
a passionate search for the sacred and
magic object that one can only reach
through the help of a woman with many
faces. She is constantly present in the
adventures of the hero, and her mission
is to lead him to his goal.
In the imagination of the Celts, in
their dreams that are symbolically
translated into their legends, Woman
was the Initiator. It was she who
introduced Man into a new world; it
was she who gave him his second
birth, in the world of higher reality
and awareness.
She was either a divinity herself or
the priestess of a divinity and the
messenger of the gods this is how
the Celts seemed to see Woman
thereby recalling the ancient cult of
an all-powerful sun goddess who
brings man the warmth of her radiance
and gives him power to accomplish
his destiny.
' But through the very power that she
incarnates, Woman alarmed the Celts.
They tried to master her, even in their
imagination. A Welsh legend which
has survived in one of the stories
of the Mabinogion (a collection of
medieval Welsh tales) tells how Man
tries to free himself from Woman's
domination.
The story is simple but eloquent:
Arianrod, daughter of Don, refuses to
recognize the child she has had by her
brother Gwyddyon and casts a triple
curse on the infant. He will never
have a name unless she gives him
one. He will never have any weapons
unless she provides him with them.
And he will never find a wife among
the human race.
Symbolically Arianrod is refusing her
maternal role, with all the social conse¬
quences that this brings. Without her
the child will have no legal existence;
he will be nothing. Only his mother
can make the child a member of the
community. All this indicates the
importance of the mother in the social
pattern that the legend describes.
Gwyddyon the father decides to fight
against the triple curse. With the help
of his uncle Math, who is a master of
magic and a druid-shaman, he makes
Arianrod speak the name that her son
will bear. He will be called Lieu Llaw
Gyffes, that is, the "Child with the
Sure Hand".
Using magic, Gwyddyon and Lieu
disguise themselves and get Arianrod
to supply them with arms. Later
Gwyddyon and Math literally "fashion"
a woman by charms and incantations
from the flowers and plants of the
hillside. They call this woman Blodeu-
wedd, "Born of the Flowers" and she
becomes Lleu's wife.

IRELAND'S BOOK
OF KELLS
Never having been invaded by the
Romans, Ireland continued
tenaciously to preserve its Celtic
heritage. Even when Christianity
supplanted paganism in Ireland,
the thread of Celtic continuity
was maintained. Irish monks
wrote down the traditional Celtic
vernacular literature which thus
became the oldest in Europe after
Greek and Latin. Traditional
Celtic art continued to flourish
well into the Middle Ages as the
magnificent art of Irish
Christianity. A masterpiece of
this Christian Celtic art is the
Book of Kelts, a large illuminated
manuscript (33 cm. by 24 cm) of
the Gospels, written in the late
8th or early 9th century on thick
polished parchment. Shown here
is the symbol of St Mark, an
enlarged detail from the opening
of St Mark's Gospel, from the
Book of Kelts. The first words of
each Gospel have a whole page to
themselves, richly decorated with
typical Celtic trumpet and spiral
patterns, stylized birds and beasts
and imaginary monsters. The Book
of Kelts originally had about
730 pages, of which some 670 have
survived and are now preserved
at Trinity College, Dublin (Ireland).
Continued from page 22
But at this point the paternal and
masculine power of Gwyddyon is
thwarted. Blodeuwedd marries Lieu
but she meets and falls in love with
another young man and runs away with
him after having Lieu killed. The rest
of the legend describes Gwyddyon's
revenge. He manages to bring his son
back to life and makes him kill Blodeu-
wedd's lover, who has abandoned her.
Then he goes after Blodeuwedd herself.
But Blodeuwedd is his creature, the
product of his mind. He cannot
destroy her without destroying himself.
In fact his creature has escaped from
him. This rebellion of the Flower-
Daughter is an intolerable blow to his
masculine authority, and to preserve
his self-respect Gwyddyon must punish
her. But he cannot make the culprit
disappear completely; so he transforms
her into an owl and relegates her to
the night. Symbolically, his masculine
vengeance consists in hiding woman
away, enclosing her in darkness and
thereby making her feel guilty and
rejected.
Thus the legend of Blodeuwedd the
Flower-Daughter who hoped to escape
from her father's authority and refused
to be an Object, claiming the right to
be free and to choose her own lover,
ends in defeat. This failure appears
to have many points in common with
what has in fact happened, not only in
Celtic societies but in others nearer to
our own times.
Woman has always tried to shake
herself free from the male yoke and to
regain her independence from man.
But man has always claimed rights of
possession; and as he cannot do
without woman as mother, wife or
mistress, he has imposed on her
taboos steeped in guilt that carry fear¬
ful penalties. Their myths reveal that
the Celts were very much aware of
this. And their society displays an
inherent nostalgia for an earlier age
when woman played a more important
role.
Moreover this woman who is rejected
and buried in the darkness of the sub¬
conscious Is not dead: she lives on,
as beautiful and mysterious as ever,
always ready to rise again into the
light of day, into the conscious mind.
Another Celtic legend, that of the
Town of Ys (a legend known throughout
Brittany), shows us how the ancient
image of woman persists on the
troubled waters of the memory.
The heroine of the story is Dahud,
whose name means "The Good Witch"
itself a revealing allusion to woman's
magical powers. She is the daughter
of King Gradlon of Cornwall, and has
built for herself a marvellous town on
the edge of the sea, or more exactly in
a hollow. The town, Ys, is protected
from the sea by a great dike (1).
But according to the highly Chris¬
tianized version of the legend that has
come down to us, Dahud led a very
dissolute life there. Condemned by
God and men, probably because she
defied patriarchal laws by being the
absolute monarch of her city, she is
doomed to perish, and the whole town
with her.
A tidal wave submerges the town
of Ys; but the legend tells that Dahud
still lives in her wonderful palace at
the bottom of the sea, and that she
is waiting for the right moment to
reappear on the surface of the waters.
When that day comes the town of Ys
will once again be the richest and most
beautiful city in the world.
The symbol is again very clear:
feminine sovereignty is hidden and
buried under the waters, in the dark¬
ness of the subconscious. But when
it reappears in full daylight the world
will regain its harmony and its lost
Paradise where the Woman-Sun will
reign, eternal and all-powerful, giving
life and the intoxication of Love.
This is why in the great wealth of
Celtic legends we find so many
marvellous adventures of heroes who
set out to seek woman in all her
aspects, even the strangest.
Somewhere in the Ocean towards
the setting sun exists a wondrous land
called the Isle of Avalon. It is the isle
of Appletrees. On Avalon are trees
that produce fruit the whole year
round, and sickness and death are
unknown. The island is the home of
beauty, harmony, colour, richness and
fertility; and it is inhabited by women.
They are mysterious faery women,
ancient goddesses, who await heroes
that have dared to risk the wildest
adventures. And men, having ban¬
ished women to darkness, spend their
lives seeking this Land of Enchan¬
tresses, because they know they will
.never attain happiness until they
rediscover their original purity, the
purity of a lost paradise. The Celtic
adventure always ends on the shores
of the Isle of Women.
Jean Markale
(1) The word Ys means "low". The town of
Ys is thus the Low Town.

ARTISTS
WHO RESHAPED
REALITY
B Y virtue of its outstanding qual¬
ity and originality, Celtic art
must be considered one of the most
remarkable aesthetic developments In
human history.
In using the term Celtic art, how¬
ever, there ¡s a risk of perpetuating
a misunderstanding that arose in the
19th century when examples of an
original art form, either previously
unknown or else disdained, began to
be discovered. This misunderstanding
is still found in a number of recent
books which attribute to the Celts cer¬
tain megalithic monuments that ante¬
date them by several thousand years.
Some specialists consider the
people of the Bronze Age (the first
half of the second millenium B.C.) as
proto-Celts; others maintain that the
appearance of the Celts on the stage
of history coincides with the emer¬
gence of the Iron Age cultures. But
most writers agree that the strictly Cel¬
tic period belongs to the late Iron Age.
Yet so many changes took place
in this period that one may well wonder
whether it represented the develop¬
ment of a single culture or whether
these changes reflect the influence of
outside forces and different peoples.
The late Iron Age, which is still
known as the La Tène epoch, from
the name of an archaeological site
discovered in Switzerland a little over
a century ago, has been subdivided
into three periods because of the
variety of archaeological findings
made there.
La Tène art did not come about
suddenly. It owed much to earlier
aesthetic developments in the wide¬
spread territories that the Celts
overran, and to the contacts they had
more numerous than was formerly
supposed with the so-called classical
civilizations, as well as with the art
of the steppes. But one should note
that La Tène art was scarcely influ¬
enced by the art of the early Iron Age.
It has sometimes been said that
there was a gap between the Hallstatt
culture (named from the site of a
Celtic settlement in Austria, see
page 12) and that of La Tène. From
the point of view of art there was a
real break between the two. The
art of the early Iron Age was based
on straight-line geometrical patterns,
whereas curves and counter-curves
are predominant in true Celtic art.
by René Joffroy
The Celts loved beautiful objects and
lavished as much care and skill on making
household pots as on fashioning their most
precious ornaments. Their taste for
artistic enrichment led them to embellish
some imported works that were not
ornate enough for their liking. A Celtic
metalsmith covered this
wooden bowl (below) with gold
openwork mounting. Celtic
craftsmen of the Rhineland, where the
bowl was discovered, were past masters
of the art of repoussé (raised) metalwork.
Opposite page, enlarged detail of two
gold neck-rings, a chance find unearthed
by a bulldozer at Erstfeld (Switzerland)
in 1962. Dating from the 4th cent.
B.C. (like the bowl), they display a
remarkable combination of naturalism
and fantasy in which the Celtic
goldsmith has interlaced half-animal,
half-human creatures. On neck-ring at
left they are attached like Siamese twins,
one facing into the ring, one facing
outwards. On neck-ring at right is a
large-eyed creature with snub nose and
short curling horns.
RENÉ JOFFROY is curator-in-chief of the
Museum of National Antiquities at St-Germain-
en-Laye (France). He has carried out excavations
at many prehistoric sites in France and is
particularly well known for his archaeological
work on the oppidum (fortified settlement) of
Mont-Lassois at Vix, eastern France. Here in
1952 he uncovered the tomb of a Celtic princess
containing a remarkable collection of Italo -
Greek objects. Among his published works are

Universitaires de France. Paris, 1954; Les

If we consider the different types of
art objects involved, we find that most
of them are articles of everyday use,
such as weapons and jewellery, and
ceramic work that has been decorated
to some extent. Except for the occa¬
sional piece of monumental sculpture
found in southern France and in the
Rhine Valley, practically nothing is
known about the Celts' architecture,
for the obvious reason that they did
not use stone to build their dwellings.
Their homes were simply huts with
wood and mud walls that quite naturally
have not survived.
We may. however, attempt to out
line chronologically the various styles
that succeeded one another over the
five-hundred-year history of Celtic
craftsmanship and art, and use this
as a framework to try to bring order
out of its infinite complexity.
By the middle of the fifth century
B.C., Celtic -art had already acquired
its main themes. Greece had provid¬
ed it with a basic motif, namely the
palmette frond. The Celtic palmette,
however, differed from its Greek
counterpart in that it was more sim¬
plified and yet complicated by ad¬
ditional features that overburdened it
and deprived it of its original character.
There is still a certain rigidity, or
rather a kind of symmetry, in the
early style that is usually described
as severe, whereas in the 4th century
B.C. various influences were mingled,
compounded and blended to form
what is known as the Waldalgesheim
Style, named after a princely burial
site in Germany.
Side by side and sometimes inter¬
mingled with flowing geometrical
curves, there appear animal and human
forms. But the Celtic artists were no
respecters of reality. Animal shapes
were distorted, made monsterlike and ^
twisted to form complex designs. V

Purity of line and a firm style gave
way to flexibility, profusion and orna¬
mental excess. This taste for greater
artistic enrichment appears on certain
drinking vessels imported from Greece
which were discovered in Germany.
Their Celtic owners had apparently
felt that the objects themselves were
not sufficiently ornate and had their
outer surfaces covered with gold leaf
decoration.
This technique of applying gold leaf
was used on a wooden bowl found at
Schwarzenbach (Germany) and on a
remarkable flagon unearthed at Eygen-
bilsen (Belgium). Gold jewellery, tores
or neck-rings, and bracelets present an
amazing variety of styles.
The recent discovery of a number of
gold tores at Erstfeld in the Swiss can¬
ton of Uri has brought to light fresh
examples of this art in which fantasy is
blended with a remarkable sense of
composition. Human monsters criss¬
cross with distorted animals in intricate
patterns.
When metalwork from the Italian and
Greek world became known to the
Celts, especially much-prized bronze
vessels such as oenochoes (wine
jugs) and situlae (pails), a need was
felt to embellish them. Gold bands of
repoussé work were therefore applied
to the wine jugs. Sometimes the ves¬
sels themselves were copied and the
imitations surpassed the originals.
A Celtic wine jug with a three-lobed
spout, found at Diirrnberg (Austria)
has its sides decorated with foliated
scrolls, the base of the handle adorned
with a human head framed with inter¬
laced S motifs, and two fantastic ani¬
mals whose heads end in long trunks
supporting the rim of the vessel.
The finest examples of this Celtic
work, inspired by classical art forms
but adapted to . Celtic tastes, are
two wine jugs discovered at Basse
Yutz, near the town of Metz (France).
The vessels are richly decorated with
coral dots and plaquettes. A strange
animal forms the handle and two other
equally fantastic beasts are fitted along
the rims.
This use of coral, a substance
unknown to the classical world or
disdained by it was common in Celtic
art where it served to decorate many
objects. Later, when the markets of
the Far East absorbed the coral pro¬
duced in the Mediterranean area, it
was replaced by red enamel which was
in general use down to the end of the
La Tène period.
Combat chariots small, light, two-
wheeled vehicles of wood drawn by a
team of horses were decorated with
phalerae, bronze open-work discs,
which reveal the great technical skill
of Celtic craftsmen who were able to
transform heavy metal into thin leaf
and lacy filigree.
Certain tombs discovered in the
north-eastern area of France, espe¬
cially those containing the bodies of
chieftains buried with their combat
chariots, have yielded magnificent

A taste for wine
and fantasy
The Celts were reputed to be prodigious drinkers.
Through their trade-links with the Mediterranean world
they imported Greek wine via Massilia (Marseilles) and
other ports. This superb bronze oenochoe. or wine-jug,
(right) exemplifies the technical mastery and stylistic
elegance with which the Celts embellished their drinking
vessels. It dates from the late 5th cent. B.C. and was
discovered at Dürrnberg (Austria). The upper part of
the handle (above) has the form of a strange beast
devouring a human head. Its lower part (above left) is
decorated with a human head surrounded by scroll-like
motifs. A grotesque little monster (left) embellishes
each side of the jug rim. These figures have leonine tails
and a trunk-like extension of the head ending in a whorl.
On each monster's back is the profile of a bird.

Celtic men and women alike were
greatly attached to jewellery. Celtic
jewellers worked in a variety of
metals and styles, and their ere-'
ations display a remarkable flair for
elegant ornamentation. The most
characteristic Celtic ornament was.
the tore or neck-ring. (1 ) This tore,
made of eight twisted strands of
electrum (a silver and gold alloy)
was discovered at Snettisham, Nor¬
folk (England). Each strand consists
of eight twisted wires soldered into
the chased end-pieces. (2) Bronze

, specimens of this art. Among them
are triangular openwork plates, thought
to be chariot-shaft ends, decorated
with opposing S forms in a continuous
lyre pattern and rows of tiny coral rods
along the bottom.
Conical helmets made of sheet
bronze were found in several graves.
Some of them are decorated with in¬
cised palmettes or coral beads. But the
most impressive of these is a later one
from Amfreville-sous-les-Monts in
northern France. It is formed of a
bronze headpiece on which has been
affixed a gold band stamped with tris-
kelions, typically Celtic threeway de¬
signs made up of spiral lines.
Bronze jewellery constitutes another
Important branch of Celtic art with its
masses of bracelets, tores and fibulas
(brooches).
Bracelets are found in the graves of
both men and women. They are made
of flat or twisted metal bands chased
with parallel or oblique lines. The bra¬
celets are usually broken rings with
knob-like terminals or tips that can be
clasped. The bands are sometimes
pierced.
Tores or rigid neck-rings are made
of metal bars, usually bronze, ending
In terminals of varying size that are
occasionally hollow. Along the outer
edge they may have a flowing pattern
made of S's or spiral lines in relief.
Tores were worn by women at the
beginning of the late Iron Age, but
subsequently seem to have been reser¬
ved for heroes or gods. The large-
sized gold tore recently found at
Mailly-le-Camp in eastern France,
and now preserved in the Museum of
National Antiquities at St-Germain-en-
Laye near Paris, is apparently one of
the latter type.
Clothes were fastened together by
means of brooches, called fibulas,
which offered scope for all manner of
intricate decoration. Those from the
Champagne district of eastern France
are of relatively simple design, where¬
as in Central Europe we find a
whole series of these ornaments called
"mask fibulas". Here Celtic craftsmen
gave free rein to their imagination,
combining fabulous animals with hu¬
man shapes that border on caricature
in an unreal phantasmagorical world
where dream and reality, naturalism
and abstract art, go hand in hand.
Representations of heads seem to
have had a magical or religious pur¬
pose as well as an aesthetic one.
This motif is used so frequently on
jewellery and discs that some art histo¬
rians have been led to speak of an
"exaltation of the head" among the-
Celts.
An echo of some such cult is reflec¬
ted in Celtic architecture. The entran¬
ce to a sanctuary discovered at Roque-
pertuse in the south of France, and
now preserved in the Borély Museum
in Marseilles, is decorated with small
niches that still contain human skulls.
This is an exceptional vestige since,
as we have said, the Celts used no
durable building materials. It was only
after the Roman conquest that the use
of stone became common.
It seems, however, that the "Gauls"
the Celts who inhabited Gaul were
sculptors. Caesar mentions their simu¬
lacra (or images) and this term may
refer to statues. No stone statue dating
from before the Roman conquest has
ever been discovered in France, though
pillars decorated with human heads
have been found in Germany at Pfalz¬
feld and Holzgerlingen.
But although many grave sites have
been excavated In what was formerly
Gaul, no sculpture has come to light. It
is true that the figure of a two-headed
god, a kind of thin-lipped, straight-
nosed Janus was found in southern
France, where the Roquepertuse rock
sanctuary was also discovered but
this area had no doubt come under
the influence of the Ligurians, a non-
Celtic people.
A curious head of a warrior with
protruding eyes, a flat face with mous¬
taches and oddly spiralling eyebrows,
was discovered at Msecké Zehrovice
(Czechoslovakia), In a square enclo¬
sure where a cult was practised. The
tore round the neck indicates that this
strange face, now in the Prague Mu¬
seum, dates from the first century B.C.
The influence of this original art was
still felt long after the Roman conquest
of Gaul, however, since idols of stone
or sheet bronze have been found in
areas that were purely Gallo-Roman.
One is a small limestone statue of a
god found at Euffigneix in eastern
France. The god is wearing a tore
with buffer-like terminals. On his chest
is the figure of a boar ; on one side
is a great staring eye, and on the
other an ear. Was this the portrayal of
a god of the hunt?
The head of another statue, known
as the Bouray god, is cast in two
sections and the body is of sheet-
bronze. The god is represented in a
crosslegged position. His feet seem to
end in deerlike hooves, and his en¬
amelled eyes give him a fixed ex¬
pression.
But figurative representation is rare.
The Celts did not usually give their
gods human form. When the Celts
pillaged the temples at Delphi in the
year 278, Brennus, their leader, was
scandalized to see statues of the Greek
gods in the likeness of human beings.
This seemed sacrilegious to him be¬
cause while the Celts adored the for¬
ces of Nature, they portrayed them
only symbolically in their art. For this
reason Celtic whorls and spirals have
been interpreted as being emblematic
of lightning, and their three-way motifs
as embodiments of the protection
afforded by the magic number 3.
The famous silver cauldron of Gun-
destrup (now in the Copenhagen Natio¬
nal Museum) has caused much contro¬
versy. This large vessel, faced inside
and out with decorative silver plates,
was found in a peat-bog in Denmark.
Its decorative motifs recall the whole
range of Gaulish mythology. Specia-

The coins minted by the Celts are no doubt one of the most
important innovations in Celtic art. Celtic artists took Greek
coins as models and rapidly transposed the classical Helle¬
nistic images into an extraordinary Celtic fantasia. Strangely
enough the beauty and originality of these coins has only
recently come to be recognized and appreciated.
... OF HEADS
Coins on upper half of page show how a classical head of a
Greek god, such as the silver coin minted by Philip II of Ma¬
cedón in the 4th cent. B.C. (coin 1) was transformed by the
Celts into a riot of curves and circles which surpasses rea¬
lity, ante-dating non-realistic art by some 2,000 years. Hair is
depicted in flowing spirals and counter spirals, accentuated
at the expense of the face (3, 4, 5) or reduced to bulbous leaf
patterns (7). The head explodes into a myriad of fragments
(6,9) or takes on the aspect of strange hieroglyphics (8).
... AND HORSES
Coins on lower half of page show how the horse one of the
favourite motifs of Celtic art was metamorphosed from
the classic Greek model (No. 2, which is reverse side of
coin 1 above) into blobs and triangles, commas and excla¬
mation marks, dangling leg bones and bean-like bodies to
achieve a powerful combination of semi-abstract (10, 12, 13)
and abstract forms (11). The striking example of a human-
headed horse shown in coin No. 12 is an explosion of whorls
and curves in a fantastic cavalcade that is light years away
from the Greek model.

L lists disagree as to its age. Some
date it to the first century B.C. ; others
consider it more recent and to have
actually been produced in the Chris¬
tian era (see page 42).
Celtic artists may well have displayed
their finest talent In the minting of
coins (see pages 38-39).
Originally their coins were imitations
of the gold stater struck by Philip of
Macedón (356-336 B.C.). The obverse
of this coin bore a head of Apollo
crowned with a laurel wreath; on the
reverse was the "biga" or two-horse
chariot, an allusion to the Olympic
games in which Philip's chariots had
been victorious.
Gradually the motifs of this proto¬
type were Celticized. The hair be¬
came flowing spirals, strings of beads
and cascading curls; the eye was en¬
larged; the symbols and motifs of
classical Celtic art spirals, discs and
triskelions were increasingly used.
The horse was dismembered and put
back together to form a number of
mythical creatures, some with human
heads or else was replaced by the
wild boar, birds or snakes.
Every tribe had its own decorative
style and this makes the study of Cel¬
tic coins difficult because certain eso¬
teric symbols are intelligible only to
specialists.
Each coin is an epitome of an art
which succeeded in making a harmo¬
nious blend of curved geometrical pat¬
terns and unreal figures in extremely
free linear designs. This is a two-
dimensional, decorative art.
Despite local variations, it had a
wide influence in Western Europe,
extending as far as Ireland which es¬
caped Roman domination. From there
it was brought back to the continent
. in the 9th century by Irish missionaries,
and ultimately became one of the
sources of Romanesque art.

In regions occupied by the Celts, between Hungary and Ireland,
portrayals of Janus (twin-faced) heads have been discovered.
They are thought to reflect the belief of the Iron Age Celts in the
power of divinities to look forwards into the Otherworld and
backwards into the world of the living. Right, Janus-faced stone
statue (2nd cent. B.C. ; 23 cm. high) found at Badacsony-Labdihegy
(Hungary). Twin faces were also often used for ornamental
motifs as on the bronze mount shown above. It was unearthed
from a grave at Malomerice in Brno (Czechoslovakia) and
dates from the 3rd century B.C.

EASTERN EUROPE
DISCOVERS
ITS CELTIC PAST
AS for lobath, after leaving
Ireland with his people after
the conquest before described, they
settled in the northern islands of
Greece. They were there till numerous
were their children and their kindred.
They learned druidry and many various
arts in the islands where they were
until they were knowing, learned, and
very accomplished in the branches
thereof. They were called Tuatha De,
People of the Goddess.
This passage comes from the early
Irish Book of Invasions, a work which
provides an account of all the various
peoples who came and settled in
Ireland. In it is embedded much
mythology and a great deal of historical
material; the association of the Irish
with the east is frequently stressed in
the early tradition, and developments
in archaeology in Ireland are increas
ingly demonstrating the veracity of this
great corpus of archaic literature.
The Celtic controversy is not new.
Scholars have argued about this
complicated subject for generations,
and it has remained unresolved. In
1934 the eminent French archaeologist,
Henri Hubert, wrote:
"It is in the very west of Europe,
in the islands and peninsulas, that
the Celtic languages are still
spoken. Which is the truer
picture? Did Celticism survive in
the western end of its domain
because it was most firmly estab¬
lished there, or because it was
driven there? Is it not in these
parts that we should look for the
main mass of the Celts, their
origin, their purest type? Here, at
the beginning of a story bristling
with contradictions,
conflict."
is first
And the conflict remains unresolved.
Much attention has been paid to the
Celts of the western world, at the
expense of their eastern brothers.
Now a new interest in their origins,
together with improved scientific and
linguistic techniques, are causing the
countries of eastern Europe to study
their Celtic past and to evaluate its
contribution to the formation of their
distinctive cultures.
Conferences such as the inter¬
national Unesco symposium, held in
Hungary in May 1974 for the purpose
of discussing the eastern Celtic World
are invaluable; they bring together
specialists who, by their combined
researches and disciplines, can guide
and inspire each other in this fascinat¬
ing field of study.
Given that there was a fundamental
homogeneity throughout the wider
Celtic world, regional variations and
specialities must be expected. And it
is in the east of Europe that some of
the most exciting discoveries are being
made.
From 400 B.C. the Celts became the
dominant power in the northern Alpine
regions, from France to Hungary. And
it was in the east that some of the
finest metalwork was created, inspired
by the toreutic genius of the Celtic
artists.
One of the most striking ritual
objects ever created by the Celts is
the silver cauldron found in the last
century at Gundestrup, Jutland, Den¬
mark. It had been deliberately dis¬
mantled and laid as a votive offering
in a bog.
The workmanship is remarkable and
the subjects portrayed are all religious.
The outer plates consist of portraits of
various gods and goddesses; the inner
ones show scenes from their cult
legends. The base of the inside of
the bowl depicts the killing of the
divine bull, an important cult animal in
Celtic religion.
The cauldron is dated to somewhere
between 200-100 B.C. All the figures
and attributes portrayed are common
to the wider world of Celtic belief.
The cauldron was believed to have
been manufactured in Gaul and taken
to Denmark for some purpose at which ^

Celtic legends
on a silver cauldron

Probably no other surviving relic of protohistoric European
craftsmanship has occasioned so much commentary and
controversy as the famous silver cauldron found in 1891
at Gundestrup in Jutland (Denmark) and now preserved in the
National Museum, Copenhagen (photo 1). For many years,
it was thought to have originated in Gaul, but scholars have
now established that it came from a workshop in Celtic eastern
Europe, possibly in Hungary, early in the 1st century B.C.
The cauldron is believed to be a war trophy brought back to
Denmark and cast as a votive offering into the peat-bog
where it was discovered. Made of elaborately chased silver
plates, the cauldron (diam. 70 cms) illustrates, with its teeming
decorations of human and animal figures and fabulous

creatures, a story whose significance is not yet fully
understood. Scholars are still trying to explain the scenes
and to identify characters such as the figure with the horned
helmet (5). Some authorities see in this warrior a portrayal of the
valiant Cu Chulainn, outstanding hero of theancientCelticworld.
On one plate (2) a cross-legged antlered figure (often identified
with the Celtic god "Cernunnos", the horned one) holds a
neck-ring in one hand and a serpent in the other. Among his
attendant creatures is a dolphin ridden by a man. In another
scene (3) a deity plunges a victim into a bucket which has
sometimes been identified as the Celtic "cauldron of plenty".
Another divinity (4) brandishes two animals, probably dragons.
iV we can only guess. But, although
* clearly showing strong Celtic influence,
there is an element in the work that
is foreign to Gaulish tradition.
Scholars have been working on this
superb vessel for many years, and it
has now been finally established that
it belongs, not to western Celtic
Europe, but stems from some dis¬
tinguished atelier in the eastern Celtic
world perhaps Dacia, perhaps Hun¬
gary, but certainly from a country
familiar with the same religious
concepts as the western Celts.
Amongst the treasures that the
eastern confines of the Celtic world
have yielded are the remarkable series
of pottery vessels from burial mounds
at Sopron, Hungary. Dating from the
late 7th century B.C. these vessels are
not remarkable in so far as they are
composed of valuable material, but
because they are decorated with
incised figures which give us a rare
insight into the everyday lives of the
people who lived and worked in this
fascinating region where Celts from
both east and west seem to have met
and developed their own distinctive
art style.
The Sopron pots cast light on the
clothing and activities of the people of
Hallstatt Europe and add a touch of
humanity to the bare bones of archae¬
ology and the confused realms of
mythology. On these vessels we can
see men fighting men, wearing the
trousers which typified the barbarian
world and were to be the typical gar¬
ment, together with the flowing cloak,
of the La Tène Celts of the historical
period. Women wearing patterned bell-
shaped skirts also fight each other,
using the time-honoured weapon of
tearing out one another's hair!
A pair of lover's part reluctantly.
Women with ringleted hair, dressed in
A-line dresses with trousers beneath
like Victorian pantaloons, and adorned
with bells, spin and weave. Others
dance, with arms ecstatically uplifted
like the dancers on the exquisite
Neuvy-en-Sullias bronze figurines from
a Druidlc sanctuary on the banks of
the Loire some 500 years later (see
pages 18-19). One woman plays the
lyre, a favourite Celtic instrument
according to the classics. Yet another,
wearing a waisted, bell-shaped skirt
and tight trousers, straddles a sway-
backed horse. And we can also wit¬
ness a funerary scene, with a four-
wheeled bier.
The value of these pots from Hun¬
gary cannot be overestimated since
they date from a period when the
writings of the classics have not yet
fully begun to augment the archae¬
ological record, and when, apart from
the remarkable finds of clothing and
equipment in the salt mines at Hall-
statt, little in the way of textiles
remains to allow us in imagination to
clothe the skeletons which the earth
yields up reluctantly.
The Celts did not confine their
activities and influence to the western,
borders of the Black Sea. They^

, spread into Asia Minor in 278 B.C. and
established the powerful Galatian
confederacy of tribes there. They
consisted of three tribes from northern
Gaul, the Tectosages, the Trocmi and
the Tolistobogii.
They retained their tribal character
and their Celtic language and St. Jer¬
ome, writing in the 4th century A.D.
comments on the purity of their Celtic
speech. The Roman historian Livy
refers to their hill-forts, a very Celtic
feature, and recent excavations have
actually revealed some of these for the
first time. Some of the Galatians rose
to high rank and power, becoming
priests of the Roman Emperor in the
1st century B.C., a position which
required very considerable personal
wealth.
To return to the beginning. The
peoples of Armorica (Brittany) were
known as the Veneti; the name
contains the Irish word fine "tribe,
family". Another mysterious people
inhabited the rich country at the head
of the Adriatic. They were also known
as the Veneti, but the classical writers
described them as being different from
the Continental Celts. They spoke a
different form of language, wore
different clothing and "many wondrous
tales were told of them by the Romantic
poets."
One wonders whether these strange
people could possibly have been
Goidelic Celts, whose origin is a
mystery and who are only known from
Ireland in antiquity. The Irish wore
tunics, not trousers, spoke a form of
Celtic different from, although related
to, Brythonic or Gaulish. They were
famed for their rich repertoire of tales
and legends. And, fortuitous though
it may be, the only other place in the
world that the famous Dublin Bay
prawns are found is in the Bay of
Venice!
The problems facing those who try
to make the early Celtic world yield
up its closely-guarded secrets are
formidable; but they are not insur¬
mountable. We may be confusing the
issue and blinding ourselves to the
true facts by adhering to the term
Celts instead of trying to understand
the early Europeans as a whole.
But one thing is certain. Friendly
and combined work amongst specialists
in every field of the study, together
with a much greater emphasis on the
richness of the material that eastern
Europe has to offer us in our quest,
may result not only in the resolving
of such questions as "Who were the
Celts?" and "When and where did the
two main branches of these people
become differentiated?" It may give
us a much better understanding of
ourselves and our modern closely-knit
community as Europeans.

Drawing from "Kölner Römer Illustrierte" - Historische Museen der Stadt, Cologne, Germany (Fed. Rep.)
WHEN Julius Caesar conquered
Gaul between 58 and 51 B.C.
the Roman Empire acquired one of its
richest and most alluring provinces.
Roman Gaul included the territory of
present-day France, Belgium and the
Netherlands up to the Rhine, as well
as all of Switzerland. This region
was occupied by the Celts, whom the
Romans called Gauls. The entire ter¬
ritory of the Celts, however, stretched
far beyond Gaul, reaching deeply into
Eastern Europe.
There had never been a common
Celtic state: the various tribes were
ruled independently by kings, chieftains
or groups of nobles. But the Celts
spoke a common language and were
linked by many similarities in their
daily life and customs, though they
often fought bitterly among themselves.
In his Commentaries on his cam¬
paigns, Caesar repeatedly underlines
the importance, from his viewpoint, of
the "oppida", or towns, of Gaul as
places where he could obtain pro¬
visions, as winter quarters and as
bases where retreating armies could
take refuge. They were also the
points where the local tribes concen¬
trated their resistance, and thus the fall
of these oppida, or of a single central
"oppidum" often decided the fate of
an entire tribe.
Caesar's own remarks show clearly
that these oppida were in fact
the first towns of Gaul. Caesar had
every reason for using this Latin term
which signifies a town and especially
one that is fortified. The oppida were
the seats of government and the
central rallying places for the local
districts and tribes.
The oppida were also centres of
economic life in which craftsmen and
merchants played the leading roles
although a large proportion of the
population consisted of farmers who
worked the nearby land but lived
within the town for reasons of security.
Religion with its priests and temples
was another important aspect of life
in these towns.
According to . ancient tradition,
Caesar conquered several hundred
towns in Gaul.' Even if this figure is
somewhat exaggerated, the actual
number of oppida must have been
considerable.
When the Helvetii, in fear of the
Germanic tribes, abandoned their
territory (present-day Switzerland) in
58 B.C., they burned 12 oppida, 400
villages and many farms (according to
Caesar's own account). They did so
in order to remove any temptation to
return. The Bituriges tribe had at least
20 towns as well as their main centre
of Avaricum (today the French city of
Bourges) said to have been the most
beautiful city in Gaul. These figures
are indeed impressive.
The oppida referred to by Caesar
were for the most part so well sited
that they were enlarged during the
Roman period and many of them,
having survived the disruption of the
early Middle Ages, still play a major
role today. This is certainly true of
Paris, which the Romans called Lutetia
Parisiorum from the name of its
founding tribe the Parisii and their
oppidum on an island of the Seine.
Other examples, among many, are
Geneva (Genava), Orléans (Cenabum)
and Amiens (Samarobriva).
Many other oppida were abandoned
or were moved from their original site
because of changes in communication
and trade during the Roman period.
The best-known example Is Bibracte,
the capital of the Aedui (today Mt.
Beuvray in central France). Its
inhabitants were forcibly transferred
during the reign of the Roman emperor
Augustus to the newly built town oK
Augustodunum (today Autun), further r

east in the valley of the river Arroux.
All that remained on the site of the
older town was a temple, still in exist¬
ence today as a Christian chapel, and
a famous market which only ceased to
function a few decades ago.
When the accounts given by Caesar
are confirmed by archaeological re¬
search, our understanding of what the
oppida really were like becomes clear.
One example Is Vesontio (today
Besançon), the capital of the Sequani.
This city was well fortified by nature,
with the river Doubs surrounding it
on three sides and the exposed part
protected by a high mountain encircled
by walls which overlooks the city like
a fortress.
Anyone looking down on Besançon
from one of the later fortifications out
side the city would easily recognize
the place from Caesar's description.
Where excavations have been made
beneath the centre of the present-day
city, traces of the Celtic settlement
have been found in the form of wooden
building beams, fragments of pottery
and other household goods.
Bibracte, mentioned earlier,' is per¬
haps the best-known example of
Caesar's observations being confirmed
by archaeological discoveries. It was
apparently the capital of the Aedui
and was by far the largest arid richest
of the towns in the region controlled by
this tribe.
Its attractions were such that Caesar
himself chose it for his winter quarters
in the last year of his Gallic campaign,
even though it stood ai a height of 800
metres on a windswept plateau. But
it gave Caesar easy access to the river
routes of the Rhône and Saône and
the valley of the Loire.
Excavations in the oppidum of
Bibracte have been carried out since
the 19th century. This mountain for¬
tress covered about 100 hectares of
hills and dales and was watered by
natural springs. It was surrounded by
a stout wall built in Celtic fashion of
stone and wood, and protected by a
deep outer ditch.
There were a number of gates con¬
nected by roadways lined with dwell¬
ings. The settlement itself was divided
into several areas. One street con¬
tained a large number of simple huts
and workshops in which craftsmen
carried on their trades as workers in
bronze, lead or iron or as artisans
of enamelled ware.

IRISH CLIFF-HANGER
Left, the huge drystone fort of Dun
Aengus on the island of Inishmore
(Ireland) is dramatically sited on
the edge of a 100-metre cliff
dropping sheer into the sea.
Impregnable from the seaward side,
it was defended against attack
from inland by three rings of walls.
To stop their enemies, the Celts of
Dun Aengus also "sowed" a bristling
"forest" of jagged rocks between
the outer defensive wall (part of
which is visible at bottom left of
photo) and the next ring. These
obstacles show up on photo as a
carpet of tiny dots. This spectacular
cliff-top stronghold enclosed
some 4 hectares within its ramparts.
In another area lay more widely
spaced and larger dwellings, whose
style and form recall the Mediterra¬
nean-type architecture of Greco-Roman
villas. This was the area reserved for
the nobles, the place of residence of
the Equités or knights. In the highest
part of the city and the area around it,
were large wooden buildings used for
markets and trading.
These constructions, along with
others which seem to have been used
for administration, formed a complex
which, according to archaeologists,
may have served as a kind of "forum".
Traces have been found of a Celtic
temple of the Roman period, which
may have replaced earlier ones. After
the abandoning of the city under
Augustus, the holy place and the
market continued to fulfil their tradi¬
tional functions right up to modern
times.
On the whole, the picture of the
oppidum obtained from these exca¬
vations is most impressive, even if
incomplete in many respects. The
remains brought to light mostly date
from the last phase of the city the
period between the end of Caesar's
Gallic campaign and the reorganization
of Gaul under Augustus in the first
years of the Christian era. It was a
period in which the loss of Celtic
independence was offset to some
extent by a time of peace and pros¬
perity in which the Celtic oppida
flourished. But was this only a late
second flowering?
The fate of Vercingetorix, the chief¬
tain of the Arverni, who led a rebellion
against Roman rule in Gaul in 52 B.C.,
is closely linked with the names of
three oppida: Avaricum (today Bour¬
ges) in the territory of the Bituriges;
Gergovia (today Gergovie, not far from
Clermont-Ferrand in Auvergne) in that
of the Arverni; and Alesia (today Alise-
Sainte-Reine) in the district of the
Mandubii, all three in central France.
Archaeological excavations have been
made at the site of each of these
towns.
Avaricum, according to Caesar's
description, was naturally protected by
its position within a swamp, and also
fortified by a wall erected in Gaulish
fashion the "Murus Gallicus" built of
horizontal timber beams faced with
stone without the use of mortar, fur¬
ther strengthened by an earthen ramp
behind. This kind of wall has been
found in many Celtic settlements from
Brittany to Bavaria; in Bourges itself,
later Roman and medieval fortifications
have unfortunately destroyed the Celtic
remains.
Fate was a little kinder in both
Gergovia and Alesia. In Gergovia,
whose inhabitants in Roman times were
forced to move to Augustonemetum
(today Clermont-Ferrand), the difficult
nature of the soil has resulted in only a
modest yield for archaeologists. In
Alesia, famed as the scene of the final
struggle between Caesar and Vercin¬
getorix, the Roman siege constructions .
have been found, together with the r
MYSTERY DISC
The object, right, is a Celtic bronze
disc the purpose and origins of
which remain a mystery. Other
similar discs have been found in
Ireland. Many scholars have seen
in the design a stylized grotesque
face with bulging eyes and gaping
mouth. Now in the British
Museum, the disc is believed to
date from the 1st or 2nd cent. A.D.

, "murus gallicus" of the oppidum, and
many remains from Alesia's Roman
period, such as workshops, temples
and dwellings. But the original Celtic
constructions have been built over and
not much is left.
Alesia's geographical situation was
precisely described by Caesar : "The
town is built on a steep mountain, with
two rivers flowing on either side of
it; a broad plain stretches out before
the town. On all other sides, it is
surrounded by hills of about the same
height as the town itself."
Anyone who stands at the foot of
the great statue of Vercingetorix at this
place and reflects on the role the town
has played in history cannot fail to be
impressed by the accuracy of Caesar's
description.
The Celtic world stretched far
beyond the borders of Caesar's Gaul.
During his expedition to the British
Isles Caesar came up against Celtic
tribes whose oppida were like those
of the continent.
He noted certain differences, how¬
ever. Sites later expanded into
the Roman centres of Camulodunum
(today Colchester) and Verulamium
(today Saint Albans) show in their
traces of pre-Roman development none
of the characteristic lay-outs widely
found in Gaul.
East of the Rhine down as far as
Carinthia in Austria, along the Danube
as far as Budapest and in Bohemia and
Moravia, a large number of fortified
settlements from the late Celtic period
have been identified. By the nature of
their site, appearance and type of
fortification they can readily be classed
with the Gaulish oppida of Caesar's
time.
Since the 1950s striking new evi¬
dence has come to light from the oppi¬
dum of Manching, not far from Ingol¬
stadt in Bavaria. This was probably
the capital of the Vindelikii. It was
abandoned when Roman troops were
carrying out their Alpine campaign
during 16 and 15 B.C. which opened
the Alps as a transit route and brought
under Roman sway their northern ap¬
proaches. The Roman administration
selected another site, Augusta Vindeli-
cum (today Augsburg) as their centre
of government.
The name of the oppidum at
Manching is unknown. Even the
builders of the Roman fort constructed
on the site of the oppidum did not
know its name, and called their fort
after the remains of the wall of the
oppidum "vallatum" (a walled place).
The site of Manching is typical, and
very similar to that of Avaricum. Built
on the south bank of the Danube on
the road that follows the river, and
encircled by small brooks, it thus
enjoyed a certain natural protection
although its main defence was a
circular wall surrounded by a ditch.
It covered some 380 hectares.
It had four gates, two of which
allowed the main highway following
the Danube to pass through the set
tlement, another opening directly on to
the Danube itself, which was certainly
used for river traffic, and a fourth which
served as an access point to the nearby
iron-ore deposit a vital material for
the town's iron-working craftsmen.
Excavations along the wall and an
archaeological survey of one gate
show two and sometimes three building
periods, an indication of the eventful
history of the settlement before it was
abandoned in the second century B.C.
The wall and the gates the latter built
in the characteristic "pincer" form, with
the inner wings of the wall closing in
to trap potential attackers in a narrow
alleyway are built in the customary
Celtic fashion of wood and stone, with
the oldest stretch of wall constructed
in the same way as the "Murus
Gallicus" described by Caesar.
So far the centre of the oppidum has
not been entirely excavated, but
enough work has been done to show
that the whole area was not built up;
enough room was left for the inhabi¬
tants of the neighbouring countryside
to find sanctuary in times of danger
with all their possessions, especially
their livestock.
The dwellings were laid out along
parallel streets and separated from
each other by fences, and their inhabi¬
tants seem to have worked the land.
Nearby other dwellings seem to have
been occupied by craftsmen of various
types, such as leather-workers, glass-
blowers, smiths, wagon-makers and so
on. Craftsmen may well have been
allotted special areas or streets
according to their trades.
The potteries which produced the
ceramic ware that is characteristic of
Manching have not yet been found;
they may have been sited outside the
walls. In the centre of the oppidum
is an open space, which may well have
been a type of "forum" and also the
site of a religious sanctuary.
Comparison of the inner lay-out of
the Manching oppidum with that of
Bibracte reveals certain unmistak¬
able differences. But both places show
an identical effort to plan an orderly
layout for buildings and a division of
the town into specific areas. This type
of early town planning is almost cer¬
tainly characteristic of other large
oppida both within and outside
Caesar's Gaul. This has been borne
out by excavations in the oppidum of
Hrazany (Bohemia) and of Stare
Hradisko (Moravia) both in Czechoslo¬
vakia, whose excavated sections are
similar in every respect to that of
Manching.
The early urban civilization of the
Celtic world in the 2nd and 1st century
B.C. shows an astonishing unity. The
contacts with Mediterranean cultures
encouraged trade, provided new tech¬
niques, and through the adoption of
metal coinage changed the primitive
economy to one based on money.
These developments were closely
linked with the spread of settlements.
Whether these contacts took place
in southern France, or whether they
were transmitted by the Celtic
tribes of northern Italy to the tribes
north of the Alps is still the subject of
much controversy among scholars.
But no one entertains the slightest
doubt that it was the influence of the
Hellenistic-Roman culture that stimul¬
ated the development of the Celtic
oppida.
The late Celtic oppida met varied
fates. Many were abandoned in Gaul,
under the rule of Rome, since the old
sites no longer satisfied the new
trading and travelling conditions; others
survived and flourished long after the
Roman period and the Middle Ages
right up to modern times.
Occasionally the names of today's
towns still commemorate those of the
tribes whose capitals they were: in
Bourges the Bituriges, in Langres the
Lingoni, in Metz the Mediomatrici, in
Amiens the Ambiani, among others.
To the east of the Rhine there are
no examples of oppida surviving
beyond Roman times even into the
Middle Ages. Apparently in this part
of the Celtic world the roots of city
life had not sunk as deeply or as
firmly as they had in Caesar's Gaul.

Letters to the Editor
ADVENTURES OF MICROBIUS
THE MICROBE
Sir,
I thoroughly enjoyed your issue, "To
the microbe with science's eternal
thanks" (July 1975). Congratulations to
your editorial team. Particularly striking
was the way your distinguished micro¬
biologist contributors explained these
complex subjects in simple, everyday
terms which the layman can understand.
Bravo, too, for the clever comic strips,
"The Adventures of Microbius the
Microbe", appealing to young and older
readers alike and serving as a helpful
guide to the world of microbiology.
I know that youngsters find them
passionately interesting, to judge from
the reactions of the 35 young school¬
children with whom I am in regular
contact.

GYPSIES IN THE
MODERN WORLD
Sir,
I strongly disagree with some of the
views expressed in "Gypsies: a Minority
at the Cross-roads" (November 1974
issue). I greatly admire the way in
which the Gypsies have succeeded in
preserving their cultural identity, their
nomadic way of life and their inde¬
pendence during centuries of contact
with the sedentary peoples of the
Western world. For me the Gypsies
are a symbol of liberty: they are Abel
to the Cain which we represent. Why
this stubborn determination to kill Abel
by urging him to settle down and by
teaching him to read and write ?
I admit that illiteracy is a handicap,
but the Gypsies manage very well to
earn a livelihood without being literate,
while achieving the remarkable feat of
preserving their traditions in a world
which is fundamentally alien and more
or less hostile to them. By all means
let us help them to learn how to read
and count if they wish to do sobut no
more. Above all let us not force them
to settle down. Let us respect and
preserve a freedom, a culture and
traditions which, strange and often in¬
accessible though they may be to us,
nevertheless form part of the human
heritage.

IDEAS OF LAS CASAS...
Sir,
I read the two articles on Bartolomé
de Las Casas (June 1975 issue) with
interest as so much of what he said
and tried to do is applicable at the
present time, particularly concerning
freedom and the right to human
dignity and not only in Latin America.
With the spread of the media together
with increased mobility, the level of
awareness is rapidly increasing in even
the remotest and most impoverished
areas.
The next step is the articulation of
the real needs and aspirations of
peoples, followed by effective action
towards achieving them. However these
are difficult and sensitive problems.
The necessary resources may not exist,
or at least seem not to. And some
authorities may not be sympathetic to
this greater participation by the populace
which they see as a threat to their own
position.
It is encouraging therefore that the
U.N. itself, as a multi-government
organization, has been strongly advo¬
cating for some time the merits of
social planning, i.e. a system which
takes account of the real needs of
people and makes relevant use of
available resources. This is admirably
conceptualized in the "unified approach"
of the United Nations Research Insti¬
tute for Social Development.
Unesco's own proposals are well
documented as are those of WHO
in respect of the importance of appro¬
priate medical staffs and their training
and of rural health care, and currently
the valuable studies of ILO for World
Employment Year in 1976.
But of themselves these proposals
can achieve nothing. It takes each
government, backed up or spurred on
as the case may be by the populace,
to undertake whatever measures may
be necessary to achieve improved
standards, let alone the ideals of Las
Casas.
As a postgraduate student of social
planning, I realize increasingly the
relevance of this outlook and the vital
need for its acceptance; its rejection
by any of us does not bear consider¬
ation.

London, U.K.
...AND THE OPPRESSIVE
HERITAGE OF AFRICAN SLAVERY
Sir.
If it is true that great ideas underlie
all historical change, it is equally true
that most great ideas have both positive
and negative aspects. The ideas of
Bartolomé de Las Casas fall into this
category.
By championing the Indians of Spanish
America, Las Casas was fighting for a
just cause, as the historian Angel Losada
emphasizes in the June 1975 issue of
the "Unesco Courier". However, it
must be admitted that historically
speaking this struggle went beyond the
narrow bounds of the defence of Indian
rights and ended in a catastrophic drain
of Africa's population.
When Las Casas advocates "mixed
marriages between the Spanish colonists
and the Indians . . . and permission for
each family. . . to take with them a black
slave or a black slave couple", he Is
indeed seeking to improve the Indians'
lot, but at the same time he is vindicating
Black slavery in the New World.
Furthermore, he admitted this himself
and subsequently repented of his idea.
An assessment of Las Casas's ideas
today reveals that their negative aspects
far outweigh their positive ones. The
legal and political content of his work
transcends the context of Spanish
mercantilism from which it sprang;
today there are historians specializing in
Las Casas's life and thought But in
Cuba and Haiti, where Las Casas waged
his struggle, the only traces of the
Indians today are to be found in
anthropological museums. The Indians
living in Mexico, Peru and Venezuela
are more or less deprived minority
groups. As for the Blacks of America,
they still bear the oppressive heritage
of slavery.

PORTRAYAL OF SIVA
Sir,
I enjoyed reading your August-Sep¬
tember 1975 number "Turning Point for
Women...".
In your colour pages, "Women
Painters of Northern India", the first
caption mistakenly referred to the
portrait of Siva as the "god of cre¬
ation". In all Vedic books, the original
texts of the Hindus, it is clearly
mentioned that for creation, maintenance
and annihilation there are three deities,
Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Siva);
Brahma creates, Visnu maintains and
Siva or Mahesvara annihilates. Lord
Visnu is the central figure, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and he is also
known as Lord Krishna, Lord Hari,
Govinda, Narayana etc. Brahma and
Siva are qualitative expansions of Visnu.
These three faces of creation, main¬
tenance and annihilation are perpetually
going on In the whole cosmos, not only
in our visible sky, but also In millions
of other planetary systems far beyond
our visibility and understanding by our
material senses.

MASCULINE, FEMININE
OF NEUTRAL?
Sir.
Your excellent "Turning Point for
Women..." issue was only marred by
Mr. Aron Belkin's article, "Masculine,
Feminine or Neutral?", in which he
claims to know the right and proper
roles for males and females, and insists
that fathers should act like men:
"strong, brave, strict, determined", and
mothers should act like women: "tender,
gentle, understanding."
Mr. Belkin also commits the psycho¬
logical atrocity of equating alcoholism
and drug-taking, which are harmful and
dangerous, with homosexuality, which
isn't.
It seems to me that the point of any
sort of liberation, political or sexual, is
that people should be as free as
possible; and that includes tender men,
strong women and homosexuals.

OUR 28th YEAR
Sir.
The first "Unesco Courier" I hold is
labelled "7th year". This month's Issue
is in front of me, in the magazine's
28th year. A fine record, and many issues
I treasure, not the least the one you
devoted to "Man Against Nature"
(January 1958).
Your magazine is great reading and
looking, too. The letters you print
echo my sentiments. May you continue.

30th anniversary
of the United Nations
On the 30th anniversary of the founding
of the United Nations, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Director-General of Unesco, has
addressed a message to the U.N. Sec¬
retary General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim. "Born
of the determination to 'save succeedinq
generations from the scourge of war, which
tjvice in our lifetime has brought untold
sorrow to mankind'", declared Mr. M'Bow,
"the United Nations continues, after three
decades, to draw its strength from an
unshakable faith in mankind...". "...Thirty
years ago, we were only at the beginning
of the great independence movement of
the colonized peoples. No one at that time
could have imagined that mankind's long
progress towards dignity and justice would
lead the nations to question the traditional
relationships between States in the econo¬
mic, social and cultural spheres, as they
are doing today...". "...We know now that
if the international community wishes to
help those peoples who . are unable to
equip themselves with the necessary means
for their own development, and to establish
truly equitable relations between sovereign
nations, it must work for nothing less than
an overall rebalancing of resources and of
the intellectual and material potential of
mankind by radically changing present
arrangements for co-operation among
States..."

Valley civilization, in Pakistan. Moenjo-
daro's outstanding archaeological remains
are threatened with total destruction
through corrosion by salts and flooding by
the river Indus. Pakistan and Unesco are
carrying out preparatory work for the pre¬
servation of the site. Unesco's campaign
aims to raise $ 5 million.
The many facets
of Asian music
Folk and traditional music from 14 Asian
countries figures on records for children
just Issued by the Asian Cultural Centre for
Unesco, in Tokyo. A co-production of the
Tokyo Centre and 15 Asian Unesco Mem¬
ber States, "Folk and Traditional Music of
Asia for Children" comprises three stereo
LP records of songs and instrumental mu¬
sic from: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indo¬
nesia, Japan and Korea (UP-1001) ; Laos,
Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and the Philippi¬
nes (UP-1002); and the Philippines, Singa¬
pore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet-Nam
(UP-1003). They are designed to promote
better appreciation of the many facets of
Asian music and thus contribute to inter¬
national understanding. Particularly inten¬
ded for use in Asia's primary and secon¬
dary schools, the records are explained in
a teacher's manual, describing the tradi¬
tional music and instruments of each coun¬
try. Last year the Tokyo Centre published
two highly successful children's books
(Folk Tales from Asia) in a co-publishing
venture in which 18 countries participated.

STIAR
OF CELTIC ART
This head of a bird made of bronze is an example ol
Celtic art. It is part of a handle and was produced
during the period of Celtic civilization known as La
Tène, which flourished during the last four centuries of
the pre-Christian era. Celt ornamental art includes a
remarkable bestiary of animals such as boars, horses,
dogs, rams, stags and many kinds of birds, all of which
were venerated by the Celtic peoples. Working with
metals, particularly gold, bronze and silver, Celtic
craftsmen created some of the most original and refi¬
ned works of art that resemble no others in antiquity.
The bird's head shown here was unearthed at Malo-
merice, near Brno (Czechoslovakia) and is now in the
Moravske Museum, at Brno (see article page 32).
