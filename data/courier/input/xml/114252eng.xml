After the troubles and the wars, what keeps the people moving? The people moves
towards its inner self, tracing the circle of its identity on the soil, says the old man
sitting in the shade of the tall tree. He knows many stories.
Is the people never still,does it always run like the graceful gazelle or like the swift and voracious
leopard?
No.The people dances in the bosom of time.
And why is there a people?
That’s not a question to ask the people, says the old man,laughing.

He rises and languidly stretches himself. He knows many stori e s.When the women return
from the river carrying buckets full of water on their heads, they put leaves on the quive-
ring surface.If they don’t,the water spills. But does it really spill?
The water falls and runs down their faces, wets their breasts and leaves glistening drops on their
arms.That’s not right.The women must carry themselves properly.They cannot become water.
The old man sits down again. He is very patient,he concentrates on the questions,puffs
on his rosewood pipe. His feet are cracked and chapped in his sandals, t h at is why he
knows many stories.
But why is this old man sitting alone under the tall tree with his smoke and his patience?
The old man is always alone.The people is always alone, he answers, without sighing deeply,
without a grave voice,without anything.
Should the people always be a mystery?
The mystery of the people is that it exists.
And stays seated beneath the tall tree?
No!
He is almost angry, this seated old man.Is the people waiting for something?
God of day and night;Spirit that lives in the tree trunk and flies between the roots and the mane
of fo l i a ge ;you who have seen the wind of blood like a ri ver with the people in it,and the lake cat c h
fire and the cry of women suddenly dried up, tell me,where do these questions come from? asks the
old man anxiously.
Question,I am thirsty.Bring me that gourd,the one over there,with the wide mouth!
He leans over the water avidly and cups his hands to drink.
Liquid fabric, do not stop dancing, or I will return from my blindness,although I no longer want
to see memory. It is where I put my silence,and now I utter other words.
He sighs.
That question sounds like a hyena bursting into laughter.
The old man rises and starts to walk around the tree.There are many stories around the
trunk:a leopard skin, a woman’s full stomach, masks and drums, a blood-stained spear,
a burnt sculpture,a cross,a fez, a book and a Kalashnikov, frayed linen, a flag.
T h at question is a spirit that besieges me with my own things, s ays the old man, c a l m e r. He sits
down again.
I am those things. Now, I can look at them again.Everything I felt on the circle and on the tree
trunk,all the blood I have wept,everything I have done in the dark lake,spilling my thick milk,
The water falls and runs
down their faces, wets
their breasts and leaves
glistening drops on their
arms. The women must
carry themselves properly.
They cannot become water.

the mask of my rites and my fears, the cry with which I disemboweled men while taking my life,
the cycle of rain and the word spoken of old,all that is me.Q u e s t i o n , I order you to sit down beside
me! Don’t you see the night coming on,like a woman kneeling in front of you,her fetishes on her

H ow can I rest at night, if only ye s t e r d ay I was rowing on the ri ver of the dead, if I put ani-

How did you know I was sitting beneath this tree?
I was told that there was a tree at the edge of a plat e a u , and that where there is a tree, a sea-

The old man’s bursts of laughter ring through the darkness.
Is that all?
I do not know how to answer you.I will simply tell you that I have crossed the centuries
and that I stopped at several places,with their vo i c e s , their time that was coming or dying,

ended with a question.

c h i l d r e n ’s song. I looked in librari e s , in the many stories of old men like yo u .Another time,
someone who crossed my path spoke of a labyrinth and a circle.When I asked him to draw
them for me on the ground because I needed to see, t h at face or that voice whose feat u r e s
and pitch I can no longer even describe, vanished,and I have only this memory:not kno-
wing what I saw or heard.When I lost hope,I knew you existed.
A man sitting beneath a tree at the edge of the plateau?
Yes.
Is that all?
Yes. . . and that he knew many stories.
And which stories did you want to know?
That question leaves me baffled.
Do you remember that I asked you to sit down next to me and not in front of me? Accept my invi-
tation.
That way, we both look at the same thing! The old man bursts into laughter yet again.
Why didn’t you write “another time”? It’s as if you were taking a kind of photograph.You would
be an accomplice. . . .

A country
on its knees
It was only four years ago that Mozambique tur-
ned the page on more than 400 years of confli c t
and war.
The Portuguese presence from the beginning of
the sixteenth century was mainly a series of military
o p e rations which did not end until after the First
World Wa r. The actual colonization of the country,
which only began around a century ago, was par-
ticularly brutal.
The Portuguese empire collapsed in 1974 and
Mozambique, exhausted by a decade of fighting
colonial rule and by the subsequent departure of
100,000 Portuguese settlers, became indepen-
dent.But the peace was not to last.A new war
broke out,inspired and supported by the white
governments of South Africa and Rhodesia,who
were determined to destabilize their neighbours.
Taking advantage of internal dissent stemming
from the new government’s socialist options, t h e
rebel Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo)
pitted itself against the Mozambican National Libe-
ration Front (Fr e l i m o ) , which had been founded in
1962 and was backed by the communist countries.
Nearly a million people died, three million more
were chased from their homes and three-quarters of
the country was devastated before peace returned
at the end of 1994, when elections confirmed Fr e-
limo in power.
M o z a m b i q u e ’s 800,000 sq km of territory
stretches 2,000 km from north to south and
contains nineteen million people. It is one of the
w o r l d ’s poorest countries,with a per capita GNP of
only $100, life expectancy of forty-five years and
an illiteracy rate of 60 per cent. Its hopes for deve-
lopment rest on agriculture and the use of its long
coastline by its landlocked neighbours. ■

The people moves towards its inner self, tracing the circle of its identity.
Is the people never still,does it always run like the graceful gazelle or the leopard,swift and vora-
cious?
No.The people dances in the bosom of time.
And why is there a people?
That’s not a question to ask the people.And why did you use a comma when speaking of
the leopard?
Swift and voracious?
Yes.
Because we are both sitting down and looking at each other.And because now,t h at comma is part
of my knowledge.

E D I TO R I A L
December 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 9
■
D rugs destroy, c o rrupt and kill.They must not be fought with half-hearted or short -
term measures.We need to wage war on them—one of the very few wars we must all
be invo l ved in. But let’s be clear about the enemy. I t ’s essential to strike at the sources
of drugs, and therefore the traffickers. But it’s even more important to attack the causes
of demand,and here too we must aim at the right target.
At the dawn of the twe n t y - first century, the excessive use of dru g s , encouraged by
powerful—and abominable—economic interests,cannot be regarded simply as an indi-
vidual problem, as an unfort u n ate encounter between a person and a toxic substance.We
cannot ignore the personal aspect, but the use of drugs has grown into a social phenome-
non which is destabilizing the economic, political and cultural relationships of societies.
O ver and above personal responsibility, societies must act to promote a way of life that ru l e s
out drug abuse.
The drug addicts are not the guilty ones. We need to give them care and assistance
before they tear their families apart and destroy their own live s.The main enemies are the
causes of the demand for dru g s — m a r gi n a l i z at i o n ,e x c l u s i o n , extreme pove rty or revulsion
from excess.
The backcloth to these trends is the moral crisis caused by the disappearance of tra-
ditional landmarks from even the most isolated societies.This vacuum makes some people
feel they are living in a meaningless world and drives others to think only about their own
p e rsonal success and achieve m e n t s.To fight the demand for dru g s , we have to go to the root
of the problem and gi ve life a purpose by promoting social activities which respect the env i-
ronment and the values of tradition and culture,whether they be of a religious, personal
or some other nature.We must offer young people not just the means to live but a reason
to do so.
Preventive education can play a very important part here as long as it is formative as
well as informative. Only then can it become an important tool in building and streng-
thening character, especially of young people,by encouraging new ways of thinking and
new lines of conduct.It should open doors which lead to new horizons,whether they be
ideological, cultural or spiritual,or sporting , technical and artistic.
This first phase of local and national action goes with specific political steps that cost
m o n e y, which should be found by earmarking a share of gross national product. C h a ri t i e s
can temporarily tide things over but cannot provide permanent solutions.We must build
d e t ox i fic ation centres which will also provide professional training, places where dru g
dependence can gradually be reduced.We must also take legal steps to fight drug traffic-
k e rs , control narcotics production and halt money-launderi n g, as well as seeing that dru g
addicts can get free treatment.
But measures taken at local and national level can only really be effective if they are part
of a coherent and comprehensive international programme.To draw up and implement
such a progr a m m e ,g ove rn m e n t s ,i n t e rn ational institutions, n o n - g ove rnmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), e x p e rt s , and friends and relat i ves of addicts must all work together. D e t e r-
mined and unanimous action by the whole society is essential to confront this growing
t h r e at to the security and dignity of new generat i o n s. It calls, in fa c t , for a new planet-wide
moral contract. ■

In the search for new sources of capital,
labour and raw mat e rials are multina-
tional corp o r ations looking to relocate in
“pollution have n s ”where environmental regu-
l ations are lax if not non-existent?
The question is increasingly being asked
at a time when the level of foreign direct
i nvestment (FDI) is rising sharp l y. This is
Po l l u t i o n f o r e x p o rt?
mainly due to the fact that both “ s o u r c e ”a n d
“ h o s t ” c o u n t ries recognize that each have
something to gain from the FDI process.
H owe ve r , some observe rs are afraid that eco-
nomic gains are being generated at the
expense of environmental quality and other
i m p o rtant elements of social we l fa r e .T h e y
wo rry that “ h o s t ”c o u n t ries will compete for
*OECD Environment Directorate
After tax havens . . . pollution havens? Are multinationals seeking to
relocate in countries with low environmental standards? It all depends
on how you look at it.
Overall, the multinationals’ track record seems clean . . .
Tom Jones*
At Dnepropetrovsk (Ukraine), waste from the steel industry is tipped directly into the ground.
the benefits of new FDI by lowe ring their
environmental standards or by reducing
e f f o rts to enforce existing standards,and that
firms will relocate to these “pollution
h ave n s ” , to gain a cost advantage over their
competitors. In this scenario, developing
c o u n t ries are regarded as the most likely sites
of pollution havens because they may be the
c o u n t ries most willing to trade off their env i-
ronmental quality for economic gains, a n d
i n d u s t rialized countries are cast in the role
of predat o rs willing to degrade the env i r o n-
ment of developing countries in order to
generate economic gains for themselves.
H owe ve r , most research suggests that , ove-
rall, companies do not invest overseas to
obtain access to lower environmental costs.
It is difficult to determine whether FDI
flows are affected by the level of environ-
mental regulations existing in foreign coun-
t ri e s. Foreign capital clearly flows to a wide
range of countries, industries and compa-
nies—some of which are careful env i r o n-
mental stewards;some of which are not.A
firm may in any case invest in a country to
take advantage of a high quality labour
force and other factors unrelated to envi-
ronmental costs.
Respect for the environment:
a good selling point
Environmental costs are often a relati-
vely small component of total production
costs,which may sometimes even be lower
when environmental standards are higher
(for example, where lower env i r o n m e n t a l
standards lead to higher costs of treat i n g
industrial water supplies).
M u l t i n ationals often seem more inter-
ested in consistent enforcement of env i r o n-
mental rules than in lower standards per se.
M o r e ove r , companies are often willing to
make new investments that actually improve

P L A N E T
the env i r o n m e n t , so long as their main com-
p e t i t o rs are also required to do so. Pa rt of
the reason for this is that multinationals fre-
quently apply a single environmental stan-
dard to their world-wide operat i o n s ,r e g a r d-
less of any (lower) standards which may exist
in a particular country.There could be three
main reasons for this.
F i rs t , the firm may have calculated that
it cannot afford to see the reputation of its
products in the (global) market-place tar-
nished by charges of “ e nv i r o n m e n t a l
e x p l o i t at i o n ” in one particular locat i o n —
charges which can sometimes result in boy-
cotts or other forms of consumer pressure.
For example, i nve s t o rs in Puerto Rican
banana production firms have insisted on
“due environmental care” by those firms,
because they perceive that ove rseas mar-
kets for their products will demand higher
levels of environmental quality.
. . . but in mineral extraction and some other resource-seeking
industries the picture is murky
Richard McNally * 
■
In some resource seeking industries
( e . g . m i n e r a l s , fis h e ries and planta-
tion crops), l o c ational preference is
deeply bound with environmental costs and
access to natural resources.These are indus-
tries where small cuts in production costs
can reap potentially large rewards.
Throughout the A s i a - Pa c i fic regi o n ,f o r
e x a m p l e , e nvironmental standards have * World Wide Fund for Nature
been lowered in the minerals sector to
attract much needed outside inve s t m e n t .
Mining in Indonesia is carried out under
special contracts which generally exe m p t
mining corp o r ations from env i r o n m e n t a l
laws,and in Papua New Guinea almost all
mining operations benefit from special
conditions which impose minimal env i r o n-
mental regulation or none at all. M o r e
S e c o n d , the firm may have calculat e d
t h at it is less expensive to apply a single
e nvironmental standard to its (globally-
i n t e gr ated) production processes, r at h e r
than to develop “tailor-made” production
l i n e s , based on va rying levels of env i r o n-
mental standards.
F i n a l l y, the ability of firms to make
“ d i rt y ” i nvestments may be limited by
requirements in their home country. Fo r
example,the US Ex-Im Bank requires any
US company taking advantage of its export
financing assistance to meet certain mini-
mum environmental criteria.
On the other hand, there is some evi-
dence to suggest that “pollution have n s ”d o
exist within certain types of firm s ,o p e r at i n g
in specific industri e s , and in particular coun-
t ri e s. I nvestments made in the resource
extraction and processing sectors , such as
c h e m i c a l s ,m e t a l l u r g y, l o g gi n g,and pulp and
p a p e r , fall into this cat e g o ry. In these indus-
t ri e s , pollution control costs can make up a
s i g n i ficant proportion of the firm ’s total
c o s t s.The result can be that small cost diffe-
rences can translate into large changes in
market share and profit a b i l i t y.These firm s
are more susceptible to the level of env i r o n-
mental costs, and therefore more likely to
i nvest in “pollution have n s ” .H owe ve r , t h i s
does not necessarily mean that countri e s
actually lower their environmental standards
to attract new inve s t m e n t s.
There is clearly competition, b o t h
within and between countri e s , to obtain
access to new FDI. It is particularly keen in
the rapidly-industrializing countri e s , a n d
An ethic of eco-efficiency, which seeks to ‘design out’
pollution problems rather than deal with unwanted waste,
is increasingly accepted
in countries which are dependent on the
resource extraction and processing indus-
t ries in which the potential for hard cur-
r e n cy export earnings may be ve ry high. I n
these situat i o n s , incoming inve s t o rs can
often successfully argue for relief from
“high”environmental costs.
But surp rising though it may seem,
i nve s t o rs in resource-based industries do
not always exert pressures for lower envi-
ronmental standards—sometimes they may
even want standards in the host country to
be raised.
C o m p e t i t i ve pressures can also translat e
into a desire to reduce waste and improve

tion problems rather than deal with unwa n-
ted wa s t e , is increasingly accepted.
FDI is also often associated with
m o d e rn technologies which represent env i-
ronmental improvements over what is cur-
rently available in the host country. Once
the investment has been made, local firms
m ay try to imitate multinat i o n a l s ’e nv i r o n-
mental practices. But there is also evidence
t h at certain kinds of enterp rises (e.g. t h e
t own and village enterp rises of rural China)
seem prone to use outdated technical
equipment from other countries that does
not represent the “best environmental tech-
n o l o g y ” , because they are undercapitalized
and because this equipment is cheap.
There is also some evidence that “pol-
lution have n s ” m ay be associated with
something other than the level of environ-
mental standards. For example, pollution
intensities did appear to increase more
rapidly in Latin A m e rica as a whole bet-
ween 1970 and 1990, after environmental
r e g u l ations in OECD countries became
stricter. But it was not the countries with
the lowest environmental standards which
attracted the most pollution-intensive
investment—it was those countries which
were less open to FDI in the first place.
“ Pollution have n s ” were found, but they
seemed to be more closely associated with
protectionist economies than with lowe r
environmental standards.
O ve r a l l ,c o u n t ries which operate straight-
f o r wa r d , t r a n s p a r e n t , and efficient env i r o n-
mental programmes seem to experience no
p a rticular loss of FDI flow s , and may in fa c t
attract some industries which are looking for
reliable ove rseas bases of operat i o n . In short ,
g ove rnments are recognizing that lowe ri n g
e nvironmental standards to attract new FDI
is often unnecessary. ■

P L A N E T
recently the Philippines made radical
changes to its mining law, creating a mas-
s i ve upsurge of applications from foreign
investors for mining leases. In all three of
these countries exemptions to domestic law
have been made to accommodate specific
mining disasters.
The direct environmental and social
impact of these exemptions can be consi-
d e r a b l e . In Indonesia, F r e e p o rt ’s mining
activities have resulted in the almost total
destruction of the nearby forests and river
ecology as well as sparking off human ri g h t s
a bu s e s. In the Philippines fourteen ri ve rs
were so polluted by copper waste that
where they flow into the sea, fish yields we r e
reduced by 50 per cent. U n f o rt u n at e l y, d e s-
t ru c t i ve practices such as these are the ru l e
rather than the exception amongst mining
operations in developing countries.
Other resource seeking industries have
also used lax environmental standards or
other env i r o n m e n t - r e l ated incentives (e.g
l ow royalty rat e s , l ow concession fees,
access rights) to attract foreign inve s t m e n t .
Examples include banana plantations in
Central America and the forestry sector in
Ghana.
Relocating from California
to Mexico
In other industries where products are
r e l at i vely undifferentiated and small cost dif-
ferences can have major impacts on a com-
p a ny ’s market share, va ri ations in env i r o n-
mental standards will become an import a n t
c o n s i d e r ation in the firm ’s locational prefe-
r e n c e .There has, for example, been a large
shift in operations of US-based furniture
m a k e rs from California to nort h e rn Mexico.
A c o n t ro v e rs i a l p r o j e c t
Dahanu conservation area to enable deve-
lopment of the port to go ahead, t ri g g e ring an
avalanche of protests.“ We strongly object to
P&O interfering with the laws of our sove r e i g n

kesman for the Pe o p l e ’s  Alliance for Imple-
m e n t ation of the Law (PA I L ) , an umbrella
o r g a n i z ation of fourteen environmental gr o u p s
fighting against the port project.“The com-
p a ny is also lobbying with the Indian env i-
ronment ministry to change the laws and
denotify the area.They should understand that
D a h a n u ’s laws do not belong to the stock-
h o l d e rs of P&O.”
In a report on Dahanu, the World W i d e
Fund for Nature (WWF) said that “ P & O ’s
actions in Dahanu are in direct conflict with
O r g a n i z ation of Economic Co-operation and
D e velopment (OECD) Guidelines on Mul-
t i n ational Enterp ri s e s.” It said that P&O wa s
e xe rting extreme pressure in India to have
the port area denotifie d , despite the existence
of other unprotected port sites which are sui-
table for deve l o p m e n t .“In W W F ’s view this
constitutes improper invo l vement in local
political issues.”
In September this ye a r , the Dahanu Ta l u k a
E nvironment Protection A u t h o rity (DTEPA ) ,
f o rmed under the orders of the Supreme
C o u rt ,declared that “taking an overall view of
the mat t e r , the conclusion is inevitable that as
the position stands today, the constru c t i o n
of such a mega port at Va d h avan is wholly
i m p e rmissible and, t h e r e f o r e ,will be illegal.”
Since then P&O has announced that it is pul-
ling out of the project for a number of reasons,
including uncertainty arising from the DTE-
PA ’s decision. ■
■ The Peninsular and Oriental Australia
Ports Private Ltd,a subsidiary of P&O
(UK) recently proposed to build an all-
we ather eight-berth intern ational port with
capacity to expand to 30 berths on demand
atVadhavan in Dahanu Taluk,an adminis-
trative area of India’s Maharashtra state.
The proposal to construct the $2.4-bil-
lion mega-port has been vehemently opposed
by the people of Dahanu, which is situat e d
120 km north of India’s business capital,
B o m b ay, and is one of the last green belts
along the country ’s rapidly industri a l i z i n g
we s t e rn coast. E nvironmental groups argue
that the proposed port would destroy the
“ e c o l o gically fragi l e ’’ r e gion and seri o u s l y
affect the livelihood of Dahanu’s 300,000
i n h a b i t a n t s , mostly tribal and fis h e r f o l k .
E nvironmentalists point out that Dahanu
was “ n o t i fie d ” ,or classifie d , under the Indian
Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) by the
Federal Ministry of Environment and Fo r e s t s
in 1991.The CRZ  bans any new constru c-
tion within 500 metres of the high tide line.
In 1996, the people of Dahanu took the
Maharashtra gove rn m e n t , which negotiat e d
the port project with P&O, to court for fa i-
ling to implement the Dahanu notific at i o n .
After a gruelling legal bat t l e , the Supreme
C o u rt of India upheld the Dahanu Notifi-
c ation prohibiting any change of land-use in
the region and ordered that a committee of
e x p e rts be formed to ensure implementat i o n
of the environmental laws protecting Daha-
n u ’s eco-fragi l i t y.
After the Court ve r d i c t , a senior official
of P&O in India stated in a radio interview that
he would support the denotific ation of the

Arguing over
an island of
biological
treasures
Is there still an uninhabited and relatively unex-
plored tropical island somewhere in the world,
where plants and animals grow undisturbed?
American scientists think one such place exists in
the Caribbean Sea between Haiti and Ja m a i c a ,
five centuries after Columbus passed by.
When they returned from an expedition to the
island of Navassa in August 1998—the first scien-
t i fic visit there since 1930—a team of experts
from the Washington-based Center for Marine
C o n s e r vation announced they had found “a mar-
vel of biological treasures” on the fiv e - s q . - k m .
speck in the ocean.
N a vasso is home to a significant number of
plants and animals that occur nowhere else. Its
macrobiota—large plants and animals—consists
of eighty-two known indigenous species.At least
twelve species are endangered or severely deple-
ted,including two species of lizard and a variety
of dove.The leader of the team of marine experts,
Nina Young,described the island’s coral reefs as
“a true gem,with some of the most enchanting
underwater vistas in US waters.”
US waters? Absolutely not, say the Haitians,
who have laid claim to the island since their coun-
try was born two centuries ago. They base their
argument on the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick,which
divided up the island of Hispaniola (today Haiti
and the Dominican Republic) and its dependen-
cies between France and Spain. France subse-
quently gave up its rights to Haiti (and therefore
to Navassa) in 1825 when it recognized Haiti’s
independence.
However in 1856 the US Congress passed the
Guano Islands A c t , giving the US government the
right to claim sovereignty over any uninhabited
island which contained deposits of bird droppings
(guano),sought after as fertilizer and for making
g u n p o w d e r.A ship’s captain, Peter Duncan,b e g a n
to mine the guano on the island, and the US
government built a lighthouse, which was dis-
mantled in 1996.
Washington recently decided that the US Coast
Guard should keep the curious away from this fra-
gile “nature museum”. The Haitians retorted by
announcing they would send their own scientific
expedition to the island—a bare, waterless rock
in the sea now declared an ecological treasure. ■
Although lower environmental stan-
dards may not be a principal reason for
l o c at i o n , if firms get the opportunity to cut
their costs they inva riably will. It is often
the case that a number of different loca-
t i o n s , both in different countries and within
a single country, meet the principal requi-
rements of the investor. Here the potential
recipients may engage in costly bidding
wars that lead them to offer further incen-
t i ves (fin a n c i a l , fis c a l , e nvironmental) to
attract the inve s t o r. This often includes a
tacit or expressed commitment to lowe r
environmental standards or enforce them
with greater laxity.
Incentives to attract
investment
Companies which have not invested for
reasons of environmental standards can
apply pressure on the host government to
lower regulations or prevent their enforce-
m e n t . High profile examples include Shell’s
oil drilling in Nigeria and Freeport ’s mining
o p e r ations in Indonesia. More recently the
P&O shipping line have been putting pres-
sure on the regional authorities in India to
declassify one of India’s three designat e d
eco-fragile areas so it can go ahead with a
p o rt development (see box ) . Foreign inve s-
tors have stronger leverage than domestic
companies because they can use the threat
of disinvestment more credibly and effecti-
vely.
C o nve rs e l y. where inve s t o rs compete
against one another, the local authori t i e s
are in a position of strength to decide how
the investment should proceed. In China,
which is desperately short of electri c i t y, t h e
a u t h o rities have been trying to maximize
power generation per dollar invested, and
companies have found themselves under
pressure to reduce their env i r o n m e n t a l
standards to win contracts. ■

Sugarcoating  
An educational programme in Cairo’s ‘garbage villages’ attracts
girls with promises of income while teaching literacy and self-
esteem along the way
■
The trick is to get them in the door.
Only then can the learning and social
change begin.
T h at ’s the strategy employed by the
Association for the Protection of the Envi-
ronment (APE), a non-gove rnmental orga-
nization which for more than ten years has
worked to improve the lives of girls and
young women living in the garbage collec-
tion communities that skirt the edges of the
Egyptian capital, Cairo.
The mission of the APE project was to
offer educat i o n , l i t e r a cy training and social
e m p owe rment to young girls living in an
e nvironment where all three were often in
s h o rt supply. But the project’s ori gi n a l i t y
(and the key to its success, according to its
f o u n d e rs) was the inform a l ,n o n - t r a d i t i o n a l
way that it went about achieving those goals.
Young girls came to the project seeking
nothing more than a chance to earn a little
side money for their families by we av i n g
rags into rugs and tapestri e s.Along the way,
they found themselves learning unexpec-
ted lessons on literacy, hygiene, child care
and self-sufficiency.
“They come here to make money and
they learn unconsciously,” s ays long-time
p r o gramme volunteer Samara A bu Seif. “ I t
works because it’s a part of their world—
not just something imposed on them by
well-meaning outsiders.”
Life in the garbage villages (see box )
o f f e rs women few educational or social
o p p o rt u n i t i e s. Running the garbage collec-
tion routes is pri m a rily the domain of fat h e rs
and sons, while mothers and daughters
manually sort the garbage and clean and
prepare the recyclable wa s t e .Young girls may
a c c o m p a ny their fat h e rs on collection routes
p rior to pubert y, but at that point cultural
n o rms dictate that they stay at home.T h e y
usually receive little or no formal educa-
t i o n — families who can afford to send their
children to school send the boy s. Girls are
often married off at the age of fifteen or
yo u n g e r , with little or no say in the process,
and are expected to begin bearing children
i m m e d i at e l y.“ E m p owe ring girls here is ve ry
d i f f i c u l t , because they’re not used to say i n g
‘ n o ’ or acting in their own interests,” s ay s
APE volunteer Shadia Iskander.
APE chose to frame its educat i o n a l
e f f o rts within the context of an income-
g e n e r ating activity. “When a girl bri n g s
back a part of the family income hers e l f,
she has more personal pride and has earn e d
a gr e ater say in her own life,” s ays A bu Seif.
The organizers focused on young unmar-
ried girls,reasoning that it would be easier
to implement mental and emotional change
before they become bound up in the child-
bearing and work cycle.The first group of
r e c ruits for the ru g - we aving school we r e
selected from gr a d u ates of a literacy school
attached to the local church. Later pupils
‘ When a girl contributes to the family income, she has more
pride in herself and has earned a greater say in her life’
were selected more randomly from among
adolescent girls found squatting on their
haunches and sorting garbage manually.
Some mothers baulked at letting their
daughters take part in this mysterious pro-
gr a m m e , but the organizers emphasized
they would have the opportunity to bring in
up to 40 Egyptian pounds (US $12) per
m o n t h , and that the flexible progr a m m e
schedule would allow them to continue
their household garbage separation duties.
“At first we had a lot of trouble convincing
families to let the girls come here,” s ays A bu
Seif. “Now we have a waiting list.”
When they joined the progr a m m e , gi r l s
found themselves presented with multiple
learning opportunities.The importance of
p e rsonal hy giene and appearance wa s
emphasized.“We told them from the start,
‘Come each day clean.We aving a clean ru g
means coming in clean clothes and wo r-
king in a clean env i r o n m e n t ’ ,” A bu Seif

using pencils in literacy lessons.

L e a rning how to we ave the rags (scraps

Quality control inspectors made deductions

tions in the ru g — e n c o u r a ging precision and

for the rugs stimulated creativity and pers o n a l
e x p r e s s i o n . “The manipulat i ve skill of using
s c i s s o rs to cut the rags proved to be vital as a
p r e p a r ation for the use of pencils in literacy
c l a s s e s ,” s ays founding project member Dr.
Laila Iskander Kamel.
Patience and
discipline
L i t e r a cy and basic arithmetic classes we r e
o p t i o n a l , but the programme organizers we r e
adept at presenting incentives to encourage
the girls to at t e n d . “ We would tell them to
measure an eighty-centimetre piece of cloth,
and they wo u l d n ’t know what eighty wa s ,s o
we ’d say ‘ Well we have these classes ove r
h e r e ’ , ” A bu Seif remembers. “In order to
r e c e i ve their wages they had to sign their
n a m e s , and if they couldn’t do that , it meant
another lesson.”
There were plenty of financial incentive s
to learn to read. Rugs with words on them
can be sold for more money at hotels and
t o u rist bazaars , so girls are paid extra for each
l e t t e r — t wo Egyptian pounds for English let-
t e rs , three pounds for more difficult A r a b i c
l e t t e rs.“Local sales events held in fa n cy hotels
and pri vate gardens were perceived as a big
o u t i n g,” s ays Dr. K a m e l . “Girls who could
not read the price list could not look after the
stands at such eve n t s.Thus literacy,or at least
the ability to read the price list,became a goal
with a tangible rewa r d .”
Education 
against excision
The girls also received lessons on
female hy gi e n e , excision and the benefit s
of waiting until they were at least seve n t e e n
or eighteen before having children.
In its ten-year existence, p r o gr a m m e
o r g a n i z e rs estimate they have trained more
than 700 gi r l s , about a quarter of whom
have achieved functional literacy. Surveys
of the graduates, according to Dr. Kamel,
reveal important shifts in their social atti-
t u d e s. Sixty-four per cent of the wo m e n
said they were practising family planning
and 70 per cent of the single girls said that
when they got married they would not sub-
ject their daughters to excision.
The ori ginal ru g - we aving progr a m m e
has since been expanded to include other
business ve n t u r e s : a paper recycling opera-
tion and a patchwork quilting programme
that focuses on older,married women.
Perhaps the surest sign of the progr a m-
m e ’s success is that the ru g - we aving school is
not only self-sufficient, but run almost enti-
rely by a staff of programme gr a d u at e s.A P E
vo l u n t e e rs stop in a couple of days a we e k ,bu t

Young women who participate in literacy classes continue to sort garbage for their families.
A government p r i o r i t y
placed on secondary education (where
pupil numbers rose by 45 per cent in the
same period).
For cultural and financial reasons
(although state schooling is free of charge in
E g y p t ) , families used to gi ve preference to
e d u c ating their sons. In an attempt to redress
the imbalance, over a thousand classes we r e
specially opened for girls in rural areas,
where even fewer girls were enrolled in
school than in the towns and cities.
Much still remains to be done.Accor-
ding to UNESCO figures, one-third of ado-
lescents aged from 15 to 19 are “out of
s c h o o l ” , a proportion which rises to 45 per
cent in rural areas. And population growth
means that a sustained effort is needed. ■
■ In 1991, Egyptian President Hosny
Mubarak’s government decided to give
p ri o rity to education and launched a fa r -
reaching programme to eradicate illiteracy.
It was time:half the country’s adults could
neither read nor write (36 per cent of men
and 61 per cent of women in 1995) and the
schools were in many cases rundown and
overloaded,with up to 70 pupils per class.
Since then, more than 7,000 schools

Learning for job-
seekers
Unemployed people and young people trying
to find their first job often do not have expe-
rience in job-seeking in a sometimes very tight
m a r ke t . In recent years, s e v e ral public and priva t e
organizations have sprung up in Europe to fill this
gap by training job-seekers in the skills needed
to enter the world of work.
The European Employment Service (EURES), f o r
e x a m p l e, gathers information from its 17 member
states1 on the job situation in the European eco-
nomic area.Anyone who has a plan to look for a
job in one of these countries can submit it to a
“ E u r o - c o u n s e l l o r ” who will check whether it is
feasible.
In each country, organizations linked to this net-
work offer unemployed people courses in how to
look for a job. Before trying to “ s e l l ” their qualifi-
c a t i o n s, candidates must first study those sectors
of the labour market they are interested in.D e n i s e
L o s s e l , a consultant with A P E C, a private Fr e n c h
association which specializes in management posi-
t i o n s, s a y s :“ We start by getting the candidates to
say what they are best at, and then we guide them
as they put together a profile adapted to the mar-
ke t .”
This is essential before taking action, says Mar-
tine Cantenys, who runs workshops for jobless
people at France’s National Employment Agency
(ANPE).“We teach candidates to draw up their
CV and to write letters applying for jobs or ans-
wering offers of work.We even hold mock perso-
nal interviews which we videotape so they can
be analysed afterwards.”
In Spain, the National Employment Institute
(INEM) also has a special service to help candi-
dates overcome psychological blocks which could
hinder their search for a job.A similar service exists
in Santos (Bra z i l ) ,where a labour exchange (which
pools job offers and applications) also provides
unemployed people with psychological help, t o
enable them to regain self-confidence so they can
display and sell their talents. ■

gr a m m e .”
But changing the thinking of young gi r l s
in Mokattam is only part of the equat i o n .A
d a u g h t e r ’s new-found literacy and empo-
we rment can come to naught or even pro-
duce serious discord, unless her family goes

used to feed the pigs and goats each fa m i l y
kept—which would then be used as meat to
feed the family or sold for profit .
Almost all Cairo’s z a b a l e e n are Chri s t i a n
since Egypt’s Muslim majority is loath to
handle pigs—one of the few livestock animals
which can live on garbage.The recycling sys-
tem has changed little over the past five
decades apart from the introduction of
m a c h i n e ry such as plastic chippers and the
replacement of traditional donkey carts with
pick-up trucks by those z a b a l e e n who can
afford them. APE organizers estimate that
the z a b a l e e n handle about 3,000 tons of gar-
bage daily—about one third of Cairo’s (popu-
l ation 13 million) daily output. S e veral gar-
bage villages now skirt the edges of Cairo, t h e
largest being Mokat t a m , which has a popu-
l ation of more than 17,000 and handles about
1,200 tons of garbage daily. ■
■ The garbage villages around Cairo came
into being in the 1940s when landless,
u n e d u c ated fa rm e rs migr ated en masse to
the outskirts of Cairo, largely from the sou-
t h e rn province of A s s u i t , 400 kilometres
south of the capital.
Predominantly Chri s t i a n , the migr a n t s
c r e ated a niche for themselves as garbage
c o l l e c t o rs (z a b a l e e n in A r a b i c ) . Each mor-
ning they would set out in donkey carts to
make door-to-door collection stops all
around the city. Individual households paid
a monthly fee for garbage collection but this
went mostly to middlemen who controlled
and assigned the collection routes. For the
z a b a l e e n,much of the benefit from the arr a n-
gement came from the extremely efficient
use they made of almost eve ry part of the
garbage haul.After carting the garbage back
to their home distri c t s , they and their fa m i-
lies separated it and gathered any t h i n g

for young girls who wait until they’re eigh-
teen before having children.
APE vo l u n t e e rs and alumni acknow l e d g e
t h at a handful of literacy classes and some
looms may not be enough to overcome social
n o rms that have existed for generat i o n s. B u t
they have their eye on the future, not only of
the programme gr a d u at e s ,but of their daugh-
t e rs and gr a n d d a u g h t e rs.
“ E ven if we don’t change the gi r l ’s
situation within her own family,” says one

new ideas to their new families when they
get married and pass them on to future

A
two-kilo cake contains twice as much flour, eggs and sugar as a one-kilo cake. A cake
can only be eaten if it’s within reach of hungry hands and mouths, and once it’s been
eaten it’s all gone.
A copy of a computer pro g ra m , on the other hand, only has a marginal cost, that of its physical sup-
port or its transfer. Internet users thousands of kilometres away from each other can “consume”it
simultaneously. And it doesn’t wear out when it’s been used.
This comparison encapsulates the difference between the industrial economy and the “ k n o w l e d g e
economy”,which is also known variously as the “intangible economy”,“the weightless economy”,
the “immaterial economy”or simply the “new economy”.In this economy, ideas, images and know-
ledge are more prominent than physical products, machines and raw materials. Just as harnessing
energy spawned industrial society, so mastery of data processing and transmission has given rise to
the knowledge economy. It is particularly strong in four leading sectors:information and communi-
cation technologies; intellectual pro p e r t y — p a t e n t s,b ra n d - n a m e s, advertising and financial services;
databases and recreational services;biotechnology.
Does this mean that traditional economic rules are now dead and buried,as the gurus of the new
economy maintain? Will these new technological tools increase or reduce inequalities worldwide? Wi l l
the new work opportunities be personally more rewarding? The extent and the consequences of the
rise of the knowledge economy, and even its very nature, are still being hotly debated. ■

The importance of the weightless economy
can be assessed at three levels.We can look at
individuals, firms and entire economies.
F i rst people. In 1997, three of the wo r l d ’s
twenty wealthiest individuals were Americans who
made their money almost entirely from software.
Their total wealth was almost ten times as much
t h at of the three wealthiest Britons invo l ved in more
t a n gible production (real estat e ,s t e e l , and food). I n
October 1998, the wo r l d ’s wealthiest individual (in
s o f t ware) was more than twice as we a l t hy as the
runner-up, who was not in software.
Next turn to firm s. As the historical vo l at i l i t y
of stock markets powerfully show s ,g a u ging the eco-
nomic success or failure of individual firms is diffi-
cult in general. H owe ve r , ave r a ging stock market
performance over longer time periods and across
individual firms in sectors of interest can gi ve a
more reliable picture.The five major information
and communications technology (ICT) firms that
an interested observer would be likely to name are
M i c r o s o f t , I n t e l , C o m p a q , D e l l , and Cisco. B e t-
ween them, these firms had market capitalization of
$12 billion in 1987. By 1997, their combined capi-
t a l i z ation amounted to $600 billion—a fif t y - f o l d
increase over less than ten ye a rs or annual gr owth of
45 per cent.Such rapid growth,sustained for such
a long stretch of time, is remarkable by compari s o n
with any other economic quantity.
F i n a l l y, consider countri e s. In the United
S t at e s , the inform ation technology (IT) share of
nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has gr ow n
from 4.9 per cent in 1985 to 8.2 per cent in 1997.
At the same time, IT prices have fallen dramat i-
c a l l y : the real price of computing has, by some mea-
sures,been declining by 30 per cent a year for the
last two decades.The real price of communicat i o n s
has,similarly, been decreasing at 8 per cent a year
for the last seventy years, a halving every eight to
nine ye a rs. And disk storage capacity has been

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
increasing at 60 per cent a year since 1991, while its
nominal price has fallen a hundred-fold. T h u s ,
without even taking into account the potential
s p i l l over effects from its increasing the producti-
vity of other industri e s , the IT sector’s direct contri-
bution to real value produced has been substantial
for the world’s leading economy.
It may not be surprising that this is happening
in the technologically advanced wo r l d . H owe ve r ,
IT contri butes gr e atly to gr owth in some of the
wo r l d ’s least developed economies as we l l . In India,
per capita annual income in 1995 was $340: t h e
majority of the population of 900 million lived on
less than one dollar a day. At the same time,India
hosts a major offshore software centre for the rest of
the world. Software production in 1997 was a $2
billion industry, e m p l oying 260,000 people. T h e
industry’s revenues have been growing by 50 per
cent a year for the last five years, with over 60 per
cent generated as export earnings.
The Internet is an important part of the we i g h t-
less economy. N a rr ow l y, it might be regarded as
nothing more than one specific concrete manifesta-
tion of progress in inform ation and communicat i o n s
t e c h n o l o g y. One might then simply say that it is the
result of rapid and dramatic technical progr e s s. B u t
I n t e rnet technology could well have emerged
without a specific application developed for it. H i s-
t o rical examples abound where one side of a mar-
ket—supply—comes on strong while the other—
d e m a n d — l a n g u i s h e s , with the result that no ongoing
d e velopment occurs. The fact that an Industri a l
R e volution did not occur in fourt e e n t h - c e n t u ry
C h i n a , despite its technological adva n c e s — s u p e r-
ior to those in the We s t — attests tragically to that .
A dramatic reduction
in transaction costs
But the Internet is not such an example. R a d i o,
a relat i vely simple, undemanding technology, t o o k
f o rty ye a rs to achieve fifty million regular users.T h e
I n t e rnet took four.This happened partly because
the Internet makes it easier to deliver what part i c i-
pants in the economy have always needed: c h e a p e r
and easier exchange, faster dissemination of infor-
m at i o n , reduced inve n t o ri e s , gr e ater outreach in
both supply chain and distri bution channels.
But perhaps more telling, this extraordinary
gr owth arises from the fact that the Internet makes
possible what previously was impossible.While tan-
gible goods can be sold over the Intern e t , t h e i r
actual delive ry to the consumer will always be slow
and will always eat up transport ation costs. B y
contrast, the Internet can deliver directly weight-
l e s s - e c o n o my goods and serv i c e s.Health care coun-
seling and education (two large expensive sectors in
most advanced economies,where historically pro-
ductivity gr owth has been famously low ) , n e w s ,
software,music, advertising, video entertainment,
s e c u ri t i e s , banking and other financial serv i c e s ,
database access and consulting services can all be
p r ovided over the Internet—unlike haircuts and
j a n i t o rial serv i c e s. The result will be a dramat i c
reduction in transaction costs. Productivity will ri s e
in precisely those areas that ,t r a d i t i o n a l l y, h ave seen
poor productivity performance.
In the US, the fastest growth in jobs is found
precisely in sectors associated with the weightless
economy. From 1996 through 2006, the industry
with top employment gr owth is projected to be
computer and data-processing services, at 108 per
c e n t . The next fa s t e s t - gr owing industry is expec-
ted to be health serv i c e s , at 68 per cent.The Bureau
of Labor Statistics forecasts that the occupat i o n s
with fastest employment gr owth will be dat a b a s e
administration, computer services, and computer
scientists (118 per cent); computer engi n e e rs (109
per cent); systems engi n e e rs (103 per cent); a n d
then personal and home care aides (85 per cent).
Wages earned in these industries and occupations
are also high. In 1997, the average worker in the
IT industry earned twice the national ave r a g e
across the private sector.
New rules
and logic
All components of the weightless economy can
be represented, without loss, as “ b i t s t ri n g s ” —
sequences of 1s and 0s. (This doesn’t mean they
are digital in the sense used in relation to compu-
t e rs. An adve rtising image is a bitstri n g, but it is
not insightfully viewed as part of computers and
computer netwo r k s.) Since ideas and know l e d g e
can also be represented in this manner, it is an easy
step to identify them with the rest of the we i g h t l e s s
e c o n o my.To minimize confusion I will call the bits-
What is the weightless
economy?
The weightless economy—also described as the knowledge economy, the intangible economy,
the immaterial economy or simply the “ n e w ” economy—comprises four main elements. F i r s t ,
there is information and communications technology (ICT) and the Internet. S e c o n d , intellectual pro-
p e r t y, which includes not only patents and copyrights but more broadly, b ra n d - n a m e s, t ra d e m a r k s,
a d v e r t i s i n g ,financial and consulting services,financial exchanges,health care (medical knowledge),
and education. The third element consists of  electronic libraries and databases, including new
m e d i a , video entertainment, and broadcasting.The fourth element comprises biotechnology, t ra d i-
tional libraries and databases, and pharmaceuticals.
These four elements constitute the fastest-growing sectors in modern economies—whe-
ther measured in value added or employment and job growth. Everything on the list contains ele-
ments of intangibility and can be regarded as knowledge.
H o w e v e r, we should not over-emphasize the importance of ideas and knowledge in trying to
understand the weightless economy. Economies have been knowledge-based for at least five
thousand years. Sumerians in the Mesopotamian river basin began carving cuneiform financial
records onto clay tablets 5,000 years back. During the first Industrial Revolution, deploying spin-
ning Jennies and steam engines significantly boosted economic performance. Such machines
were the physical embodiment of new knowledge.
But while steam engines or clay tablets are physical objects which contain knowledge, they
do not resemble knowledge in their use. Their uses are bound by geographical and physical
constraints. An oil supertanker is not part of the weightless economy, but computer software is.

The impact of an image is not diminished 
the more people look at it.
t ring pieces of the weightless economy know l e d g e -
p r o d u c t s. This emphasizes their symbolic simila-
rity to knowledge but, at the same time, maintains
their distinctness.There are three points to bear in
mind.
F i rs t , like know l e d g e ,k n owledge-products show
i n finite expansibility (a term due ori ginally to T h o-
mas Je f f e rs o n ) .They do not get used up, p hy s i c a l l y.
The usefulness of computer software is not reduced
the more users run it.A d ve rtising imagery does not
diminish in impact the more people view it; i n d e e d ,
the opposite holds.
The same terminology is apt for how a know-
l e d g e - p r o d u c t — u n l i k e , s ay, a typical durable
good—disrespects geographical distance.A know-
ledge-product behaves as if it expands to fill all ava i-
lable space. I can, in London, use a piece of softwa r e
l o c ated on some satellite server encircling the eart h
while someone else in Stanford, C a l i f o rn i a , d o e s
exactly the same, with the identical piece of soft-
wa r e .This holds true for any intellectual property or
libraries and databases. It does not apply for,say, a
c h o c o l ate-chip cookie. When someone eats a
cookie,it is no more.
S e c o n d , like know l e d g e , k n ow l e d g e - p r o d u c t s
s h ow superstar dynamics. To understand this,
consider first the wheel. Society does not rewa r d
reinvention of the wheel, but multiple implemen-
t ations of (the idea of) a wheel do get properly com-
p e n s at e d . H owe ve r , those multiple instances are
fashioned out of hard physical material which the
buyer pays for.
Knowledge-products,by contrast,are the idea
and implementation rolled in one—multiple imple-
m e n t ations require no physical mat e ri a l . Fo r
e x a m p l e , the fastest way to appreciate an idea in
computer software is to see that software running;
the only way to value the contents of a computer
d atabase is to access the database itself; the only
way to understand a gene sequence is to see it
expressed in a lifeform.In short, we cannot distin-
guish between the product and the idea behind it.
In this context, reproductions of an ori gi n a l
k n owledge-product should fetch zero price in a we l l -
functioning market. S u p e rstar dynamics refers to
this first-(or winner)-takes all characteristic shared by
both knowledge and know l e d g e - p r o d u c t s.
However,this zero-price property does not say
t h at knowledge-products are va l u e l e s s : water is
essential to human we l fa r e , but its price in modern
societies is, for all practical purp o s e s ,z e r o. B u n d l i n g
water with something else—adding carbonation to
wat e r , extracting it from certain distinguished
springs, associating it with a powerful advertising
image—can, of course, be a rewarding enterprise.
Businesses can and do add va l u e , similarly to many
k n owledge-products in the weightless economy.
For example, the value that the Nike shoe company
g e n e r ates is not the raw mat e rial in its shoes, but the
culture associated with them. The value that the
c o n s u l t a n cy firm JP Morgan generates by gi v i n g
away its raw data is not in the data itself but in the
bundling of that inform ation with a part i c u l a r
financial perspective—and who better to continue
to develop that perspective than JP Morgan itself.
For many software companies,rewards don’t lie in
the software itself, but the services provided and
the organizing of a community of users.
Labs for producing
intellectual property
T h i r d , like know l e d g e , k n ow l e d g e - p r o d u c t s
h ave a chain of production that is irr e c ove r a b l y
i n t ri c ate and uncert a i n . Applying more fa c t o r
inputs in an effort to increase output can be self-
defeating.Just as making nine men pregnant for a
month fails to produce a new-born baby, throwing
more programmers at a software project does not
typically make a complete piece of software faster,
b e t t e r , or more reliable. S i m i l a r l y, financial consul-
t i n g, a musical composition, or devising the cen-
tral image in an advertising campaign calls not for
m a ny hands, but few. The same dynamic applies
with scientific discoveries; many researchers work
on the same problem to reach the same discovery
simultaneously.
These three properties imply that the way bu s i-
nesses operate should change and that appropri at e
g ove rnment policies will need to acknowledge those
changes. As a first step, one might think of econo-
mies comprised entirely of knowledge-products—
weightless economies—as being like large labora-
tories for producing intellectual property broadly
defined.The problem is that the systems of intel-
lectual property for organizing patents and copy-
rights are based on principles and conceptions
which no longer apply in the weightless economy.
The question is not whether a new set of market
rules has emerged, but the ways in which people,
governments and firms can respond to them. ■

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
December 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 21
■
The “new economy ” has arri ved! An era of
prosperity and social well-being has dawned
for America,and hence the world.There will
be limitless growth and in all likelihood recessions
will be a thing of the past.This is the message that
a section of the American press has been proclai-
ming in the last two years.
“All the elements are in place for an era of long-
term growth,” trumpeted Business Week in August
1998,going on to say, “You ain’t seen nothing yet.
We’re just at the start of a powerful surge in tech-
nology that will boost economic gains into the next
c e n t u ry.” The monthly W i r e d, a pillar of the
“connected society”, has devoted several issues to
this new economy based on a logic of networks and
cyberspace which,so it is claimed,has superseded
the old economy of the industrial era. S u p p o rt e rs of
the new economy doctrine maintain that the health
of the American economy in recent years (in 1997
The e m p e ro r ’s

Noted American economist Paul Krugman believes
there may be less to the ‘new economy’ doctrine than
meets the eye
gross domestic product grew by almost 4 per cent,
u n e m p l oyment fell to 4.6 per cent, and inflat i o n
was less than 2 per cent) is not a passing phase.
They regard these good results as the first fruits of
a profound and lasting change due to increased
business productivity, and insist that they are
revolutionary. If they attract relatively little notice,
it’s because they don’t show up in the usual statis-
tical indicators,which were devised for yesterday’s
economy.
H owe ve r , those who sing the praises of the new
economy have been pilloried by a number of lea-
ding economists, headed by Paul Krugman of the
Massachusetts Institute of Te c h n o l o g y. K ru g m a n
admits that “for the first time since the invention of
printing, information processing and distribution
has become one of the leading sectors ,” but he also
‘We have had a favourable turn in the business 
cycle . . . probably also helped by shifts in the labour
market that have reduced the bargaining power of
workers and therefore allowed fuller employment
without accelerating wage increases. The success is
real, but it is also modest, and falls far short of
justifying the triumphant rhetoric one now hears so
often.’
warns that the very low rates of inflation and high
p r o fits recently recorded in the United States do
not justify the “millennial optimism” expressed in
the business press and by some intellectuals.
A b ove all, he believes that these good results
are not linked to an exceptional degree to the extra-
o r d i n a ry productivity increases associated with
i n f o rm ation technologi e s. K rugman and another
American economist,Robert J. Gordon of North-
we s t e rn Unive rs i t y, b e l i e ve that periods of rapid
gr owth in productivity have systematically been
made possible by fundamental innovations eve r
since the beginning of the Industrial Revo l u t i o n .
This process occurred with the coming of electri c i t y
and the internal combustion engine,and the same
thing is happening today as a result of the Internet
and electronics.
K rugman estimates that the major aggr e g ates of
the A m e rican economy are continuing to obey clas-
sical mechanisms. He believes that even if the sta-
tistical apparatus may be out of dat e ,t h at is no rea-
son to underestimate the productivity figures.
The “fundamentals”improved in recent years,
he wrote in Foreign A f fa i rs in May 1998, b e c a u s e
“ we have had a favourable turn in the business cy c l e
. . . probably also helped by shifts in the labour mar-
ket that have reduced the bargaining power of wo r-
k e rs and therefore allowed fuller employ m e n t
without accelerating wage increases.The success is
real, but it is also modest,and falls far short of jus-
tifying the triumphant rhetoric one now hears so
often.”
Finally, believers in the new economy doctrine
maintain that if the United States has recovered its
position of world economic leadership it is because
of America’s advance in new technologies.Wrong,
s ays Kru g m a n . A m e ri c a ’s economic competitors
are not lagging behind because of their slowness to
enter the new economy but for other reasons—
Japan is enmeshed in crises,especially in banking,
and Europe is facing constraints imposed by the
c o n s t ruction of monetary union. “Our curr e n t
sense that we are on top of the world is based on a
huge exaggeration of a few good years here, a few
bad ye a rs elsewhere,” he say s. He notes that one
good old maxim should not be forgotten: n e ve r
underestimate the competition.A precept that not
even the new economy seems likely to disprove. ■

■
As we move from the industrial to the infor-
mation age, access to the global information
infrastructure for economies, companies and
individuals becomes paramount.
The debate about the we l fare implications of
the inform ation revolution for developing coun-
tries has given rise to diametrically opposed views.
Some believe that inform ation and communica-
tions technologies (ICT) can be mechanisms
enabling developing countries to “leapfrog”stages
of deve l o p m e n t . O t h e rs see the emerging global
information infrastructure as contributing to even
wider economic divergence between deve l o p i n g
and industrialized countri e s. The reality is more
complex.
A number of trends are broadly recognized as
the hallmarks of the inform ation age. F i rs t , I C T
p r o gress is expected to continue to promote the
p r o l i f e r ation of communication networks as the
costs of delivering these networks decline and the
quality of their services improves.
S e c o n d , in a networked env i r o n m e n t , the incen-
t i ves for specialization and outsourcing increase.
This puts a premium on flexibility and responsive-
ness as business cycles shorten and interactions
between producers and consumers expand.
T h i r d , electronic commerce is expected to
continue to expand rapidly and further contribute
to the internationalization of service activities.
Fo u rt h ,i n f o rm ation flows are at the ve ry core of
the globalization process as countries and corp o r a-
tions project power by promoting their own cul-
ture and values on a global basis.
Will the networked economy widen or narrow the gap between
developing and industrialized countries?
* Information for Development
Programme (infoDev),a multi-
donor grant facility managed by the
World Bank, Washington, D.C. This
article commits the author only.
These trends suggest that the countries that are
better positioned to thrive in the new economy are
those that can rely on: widespread access to com-
munication networks for their companies and citi-
z e n s ; the existence of educated labour-force and
consumers;and the availability of institutions that
promote knowledge creation and dissemination.
Against this background,developing countries
seem to be at a significant disadvantage vis-à-vis
i n d u s t rialized countri e s. According to the Wo r l d
B a n k , by 1995 low-income economies averaged less
than 2.6 telephone lines per 100 inhabitants and
less than two computers per 1,000 inhabitants, in
contrast to a teledensity of 54.6 per 100 and a com-
puter penetration of 199 per 1,000 in high-income
economies. Internet penetration is even more ske-

trialized economies) accounting for more than 85
per cent of the existing worldwide Internet hosts
by the end of 1997.
Income inequality
and computer literacy gaps
The quality and coverage of schooling at all leve l s
are also characterized by significant gaps betwe e n
i n d u s t rialized and developing countri e s.These gaps
reinforce income inequality, not only intern at i o n a l l y,
but also within each nation as the ratio of female to
male illiteracy tends to be higher the lower the leve l
of economic development and the benefits of public
e d u c ation are typically skewed toward the ri c h e r
c l a s s e s.The gaps are even more dramatic when trans-
l ated to the field of computer literacy.
F i n a l l y, d e veloping countries are ill equipped
to implement pro-competitive regulatory regimes.
In the same ve i n , the culture of protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights is often
an alien concept.The same applies to reliance on
n e t works to promote transparency and access to
government services.
All these indicat o rs seem to point towards a
social transformation that will increase rather than
diminish economic divergence at the international
l e ve l .D e veloping economies would be condemned
to fall further behind in the intern ational econo-
mic race because of their lack of connectivity and
ability to transform the inform ation explosion into
a knowledge revo l u t i o n . Once one analyses the dri-
vers of the information revolution,however, a dif-
ferent picture begins to emerge.

c a n , for example, leapfrog stages of deve l o p m e n t
by investing into fully digitized networks rather than
continuing to expand their outdated analog-based
infrastructure.There are advantages in being a fol-
lower—e.g.,not having to cope with the technolo-
gical obsolescence of well developed wireline net-
works—and they are illustrated by the fact that
l ow-income economies presented a higher share of
digital telephone lines (94.7 per cent) than high-
income economies (85.5 per cent) by 1996. ICT
are also creating new development opport u n i t i e s
to address some of the handicaps of deve l o p i n g

F i rs t , by developing a modern inform at i o n
i n f r a s t ructure countries can reduce isolation and
e x c l u s i o n . M a ny countries are experiencing fa s t
expansion of cellular telephony as an alternative to
inefficient conventional network services.Wireless
technology can also provide affordable connecti-
vity to rural areas in a fraction of the time that was
required in the past to expand conventional tele-
phone netwo r k s. In Bangladesh, for example,“ w i r e-
less wo m e n ” were gi ven loans of $350 each by Gra-
meen Bank to cover the initial costs of the

become service prov i d e rs in the rural areas. M o r e o-

value-added services can be customized to the
needs of the poor. In South A f ri c a , for example,
such centres are being used to provide access to the
Internet and to help answer questions concerning
health,employment,and human rights issues.
S e c o n d , c o u n t ries can accelerate educat i o n a l
d e velopment by using their inform ation infra-
s t ructures for distance educat i o n . The costs and
e f f e c t i veness of such programmes are improv i n g
d r a m at i c a l l y. ICT is also being used for lifelong
learning, opening opportunities for new players in

dynamism of these new entrants can challenge
conventional educational systems and play a cata-

How do you create an $18 billion company in
just 14 ye a rs? Michael Dell began in 1984 with
a simple business insight. He could bypass the
dealer channel through which personal computers
were then sold. I n s t e a d , he would sell directly to
c u s t o m e rs and build customized products to order.
In one swo o p, Dell eliminated the reseller’s markup
and the costs and risks associated with carry i n g
large inve n t o ries of finished goods. The form u l a
became known as the direct business model, and it
gave Dell a substantial cost advantage.
D e l l ’s product line has expanded over the ye a rs.
In additon to desktop personal computers , the com-
p a ny now sells a broader range of hardwa r e — l a p-
t o p s , s e rve rs , and wo r k s t at i o n s. But make no mis-
t a k e , Dell sells physical t h i n g s, m a n u factured goods
t h at must be assembled and transported and delive-
red and serviced with a staff of about 22,000 wo r l d -
wide and a base in Round Rock,Te x a s. It sounds a lot
like the old, t a n gible economy.
Is Dell, t h e n , stuck in the past of mat e rial goods
and physical flows? Or is it part of the so-called “ n e w
e c o n o my ” ,c r e ating wealth through “ i n t a n gible streams
of dat a , images and symbols”. In fa c t , Dell is both.
Companies have always thri ved by offering cus-
tomers superior value, giving them more for less.
For the most part, they offer better value by shrin-
king the time and the resources consumed in mee-
ting customers ’n e e d s.The fundamental economic
rules of business have n ’t changed. But like many
other companies today, Dell is harnessing the tools
of the knowledge economy — i n f o rm ation and tech-
nology—to bring new levels of efficiency and pro-
ductivity to the old world of tangible goods.
Supplier partnerships
Consider all the activities and resources that go
into making and selling a computer. As a small
s t a rt - u p, Dell simply couldn’t afford to create eve ry
piece of that value chain. Instead, its strategy has
been to build systems from components made by
other companies. Let them invest in R&D and in
factories. For each component, Dell evaluates the
field and picks the best to be its suppliers.
Dell then works so closely with them that they
b e c o m e , in Dell’s wo r d s , “ v i rtually integr at e d ” .
While they remain independent companies, e a c h
free to focus on what it does best,they share infor-
m ation and co-ordinate their activities as if they
were part of one vertically integrated company.
Managing
Dell Computer gains time—and money—by
using technology and information to blur
traditional boundaries between a company
and its customers
ved its tax revenue by computerizing the country’s
tax administrat i o n . M o r e ove r , c o u n t ries can now
automate their institutions administering intellec-
tual property rights, strengthening their efficiency
and enforcement capability at a fraction of the costs
that prevailed in the past.
In short , the logic of the networked economy is
one of inclusion rather than one of exclusion. A s
technological progress continues to push the costs
of computing and bandwidth down,opportunities
for development-oriented applications of ICT will
m u l t i p l y. M o r e ove r , for those already connected
the value of the network increases exponentially as
new participants join the community.
Technological determinism
and government policies
These considerations point toward a more opti-
mistic scenario for developing countri e s ’p a rt i c i p a-
tion in the emerging knowledge economy.
A l t h o u g h , no doubt, income and wealth inequality
m ay increase in the initial stages of the process,
c atch-up can also happen at a much faster pace
than in the past.ICT spending, for example, grew
more quickly in most developing regions than in
high-income economies in the 1992-97 peri o d .A n d
c o u n t ries like South A f rica and Brazil already boast
a higher share of networked personal computers
than most industrialized economies.
These scenarios can be criticized for sharing a
common feature: technological determinism.The
different outcomes predicted, h owe ve r , i l l u s t r at e
that they are also influenced by other variables, in
particular,government policies.
If, for example,developing countries maintain
regulatory barriers to the expansion of networks—
e.g., by favouring monopolistic providers for tele-
com services—the likelihood of the first scenari o
i n c r e a s e s. In this case, global dualism will be magni-
fied not only across the conventional North-South
d i v i d e , but also in terms of country - l e vel economic
inequality as a small elite of connected people in the
South benefit from the global inform ation infra-
structure.
On the other hand, if regulat o ry roadblocks are
properly addressed and efforts to promote univer-
sal access to value-added networks and computer
literacy are implemented,then the possibilities for
catching up will proliferate. Participation in multi-
l ateral effort s — e . g . ,n e g o t i ations conducted under
the World Trade Organisation and the World Intel-
lectual Property Organization—can also be used
to leverage the process of institutional moderniza-
t i o n . Under these circumstances, the benefits of the
r e volution will be widely disseminated both at
national and international levels.
The most likely outcome, h owe ve r , is a combi-
n ation of both scenarios in which a subset of deve-
loping countries is able to converge with high-income
economies more quickly than ever before while
o t h e rs lag further behind. I n t e rn ational efforts to
promote pilot projects in this field can increase the
number of countries in the first cat e g o ry. ■

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
velocity Joan Magretta*
Dell’s Internet sales run to 
$6 million a day.Real-time inform ation sharing with suppliers is
the key to just-in-time assembly. Instead of having
suppliers make periodic deliveries to a warehouse,
Dell tells them the exact number of components it
needs, at what hour of the day, delivered to which
loading dock at its fa c t o ry.This is precisely the kind
of information a company would freely share with
an internal supplier.
D e l l ’s rule in working with part n e rs is to have as
few as possible, and to keep them as long as they
maintain their technological and quality leaders h i p.
As Michael Dell notes, “This isn’t like the auto-
mobile bu s i n e s s , where you find a tire supplier that
you will probably stick with foreve r.” Managed this
way, supplier part n e rships gi ve Dell the flexibility to
respond to changes in the market.
Supplier partnerships aren’t new to the know-
ledge economy, nor is just-in-time manufacturing.
However,today’s technology enhances the econo-
mic incentives to collaborat e . Companies can share
design databases and methodologies in ways that
we r e n ’t possible just five to ten ye a rs ago. Doing so
can dramatically speed time to market, thus crea-
ting substantial value which the bu yer and supplier
can share.
Why time is money
“In our industry,” Michael Dell explains, “ i f
you can get people to think about how fast inven-
tory is moving, then you create real value.The key
challenge—and the biggest change from business as
usual—is changing the focus from how much inve n-
tory there is to how fast it’s moving.”
Speed is critical for two reasons. F i rs t , in the
computer business the cost of components goes
down as much as 50 per cent a year.The company
with two or three months of inventory will be at a
significant cost disadvantage to the company with
e l e ven days because its products were built with
more expensive parts. Second,in technology mar-
kets with frequent product transitions, it’s easy to
get stuck holding obsolete inve n t o ry, or to be late to
market with the hottest new products.
C o - o r d i n ation between companies is not new to
the knowledge economy. However, such tight co-
ordination would not be possible without sophisti-
c ated data exchange. M a n a ging velocity is about
m a n a ging inform at i o n , using a constant flow of
i n f o rm ation to dri ve operating practices. In essence,
Dell substitutes information for inventory.
The result is that Dell turns its inve n t o ry ove r
t h i rty times per ye a r , an extraordinary feat gi ven the
complexity of its product line. But without credible
information about what customers are actually
bu y i n g, s ays Dell, “ t rying to manage eleven days of
i nve n t o ry would be insane.We couldn’t do it without
c u s t o m e rs who work with us as part n e rs.”
Forecasting customer needs
Working closely with customers is critical to the
Dell strat e g y.With the direct model, Michael Dell
e x p l a i n s ,“ You actually get to have a relationship with
the customer.And that creates valuable inform at i o n .”
Ninety per cent of Dell’s sales go to institu-
t i o n s — business or gove rnment—and 70 per cent to
very large customers that buy at least $1 million in
PCs a ye a r.With those large customers , Dell main-
tains an on-site team that functions less as a ve n d o r
and more as the customer’s inform ation techno-
logy department for PCs.The team will typically be
involved in planning the customer’s PC needs and
the config u r ation of their netwo r k .Thus Dell’s sales
account managers have unusually good inform a-
tion on what each customer intends to buy.
Smaller customers buy direct from Dell ove r
the telephone. Not only can Dell compile real-time
d ata about what ’s selling, but its salespeople can
also steer customers, while they’re on the phone,
toward product configurations that are available—
further using information to fine-tune the balance
between supply and demand.
In short ,by eliminating the middleman,Dell cap-
tures valuable inform ation from customers—which it
uses to lower its inve n t o ry, its costs, and its ri s k s. I n f o r-
m ation from the customer flows all the way through
m a n u fa c t u ring to Dell’s suppliers , making the whole
an efficient and flexible system. In this way, the direct
model allows Dell to build computers to meet real
demand from real end customers.
B e yond substituting inform ation for inve n t o ry,
Dell combines technology and inform ation to blur
‘I’m only half joking when I say
that the only thing better than the Internet 
would be mental telepathy’

For the past six years, the computer services
c o m p a ny De Chazal Du Mée (DCDM)
Consulting has worked hard to establish itself
in the sunny island of Mauri t i u s. It has thought
big and taken a gamble by developing and export i n g
its own software.
With a score of other firm s , DCDM Consul-
ting is a pioneer among the computer companies
which have recently sprung up in the island. Most
of these firms have gone into data inputting for big
European companies. The gove rnment agency
which promotes new technology, the Nat i o n a l
Computer Board (NCB), s ays about fifty firms are
also selling hardware.
DCDM Consulting was started in 1992,when
the computer industry was beginning to take off.
“The firm is completely in pri vate hands and we
h ave n ’t had a cent of gove rnment subsidy,” s ay
Yolaine Yong and Pratik Ghosh, who manage the
company under its Singaporean chief, Seow Liang
Pe rn g . “But the conditions the gove rnment has
c r e ated to encourage new technology have really
helped us.”
Foreign experts
and financial incentives
Since 1989, when the NCB was set up, t h e
g ove rnment has been concentrating on pushing the
c o m p u t e ri z ation of the island’s firm s. It has brought
in foreign expert s , mostly from Singapore, and pro-
vided incentives such as low-interest loans and cus-
toms duty exemptions for companies import i n g
material to computerize their operations.
More recently, a “computer park” was opened
south of the capital, Po rt - L o u i s. Companies setting
up there get tax breaks and the use of cheap-r at e ,
The Indian Ocean’s digital tiger
With its bold decision-make rs, skilled labour force and
ambitions for globalization, Mauritius stakes its claim to join
the information economy
A small island can have big ambitions—and Mauritius 
does not hide its aspiration to become the top supplier of computer
services in the Indian Ocean
the traditional boundaries that separate a company
from its customers.
Consider technical support . Dell has made it
possible for its customers to access its internal sup-
p o rt tools on-line in the same way as Dell’s ow n
technical support teams do. In effect, Dell is
enabling the customer to service itself, saving time
and money on both sides.
New roles for customers
Dell has done something analogous with its sel-
ling function. It has developed customized Intranet
sites called Premier Pages for well over 400 of its
largest global customers,giving them direct access
to purchasing and technical information.A custo-
mer can allow its thousands of employees to use
the Premier Page as a kind of interactive catalogue
of all the model configurations that the company
a u t h o ri z e s ;e m p l oyees can then price and order the
PC they want. Employees are happy to have some
choice, and Dell and the customer both eliminate
all the paperwork and sales time normally associa-
ted with corporate purchasing.
Beyond Dell’s mechanisms for sales and sup-
p o rt , the company has set up a number of forums to
exchange inform ation with the customer. P l at i n u m
Councils, for example, are regional meetings—in
A s i a - Pa c i fic, Ja p a n , the US, and Europe—of Dell’s
largest customers. In these meetings, Dell’s senior
technologists share their views on where the tech-
nology is heading over the next two ye a rs and listen
to customers talking about their needs. Helping the
customer anticipate the flow of new technology
helps Dell, as well, in thinking about new product
offerings and in forecasting demand.
Most of the managerial challenges at Dell
Computer have to do with speeding the pace of
e ve ry element of its bu s i n e s s. Life cycles are mea-
sured in months, not ye a rs , and companies must
m ove fast to stay in the game. In a world where
customer needs and technologies change quickly,
m a n a g e rs must sense and respond to rapid shifts,
process new inform ation ve ry quickly and make
decisions in real time.
In that context,Internet commerce has been a
l o gical extension of Dell’s direct model. Dell began
selling direct on the Net in 1996.Within the first
year, Dell reached a run rate of $2 million a day, a
figure that has gr own to roughly $6 million a day in
1 9 9 8 . “Because what we ’re all about is shri n k i n g
the time and the resources it takes to meet custo-
m e rs ’n e e d s ,” explains Michael Dell, “I’m only half
joking when I say that the only thing better than
the Internet would be mental telepathy.” ■

Last year, the country passed a copyright law and
set up a ministry of telecommunications and infor-

h ave included computing in their curri c u l u m .L a s t
June, the government announced it would set up
the Mauritius Institute of Te c h n o l o gies to train
high-flying technicians.
The switch
to computers
A small island can have big ambitions, a n d
Mauritius does not hide its aspiration to become
the top supplier of computer services in the Indian
Ocean, the region’s “digital tiger”.
At the start of the 1990s it was not all that easy
for inexperienced local firms to switch to compu-
t e rs. They had to know what to buy and how to
maintain their new systems. A need for computer
s e rvices was born . A response came when the
accounting firm De Chazal du Mée, a partner of the
big intern ational consulting company A n d e rs e n
Wo r l d w i d e , set up DCDM Consulting to advise
large companies,mostly sugar factories and textile
mills.
The demand for software soon followe d .To d ay,
Yong and Ghosh are proud of having devised an
accounting software package used by about forty
firms,computer systems for insurance companies,
banks and the national airline, and an integr at e d
management system for sugar factories.
Moving up
the ladder
DCDM’s staff of about 160 computer techni-
c i a n s , e n gi n e e rs , s t at i s t i c i a n s , economists and
accountants—all of them unive rsity gr a d u at e s —
were trained in Mauritius or in Europe. Most are
recruited at the bottom of the ladder,as “analysts”
e a rning about 8,000 rupees ($320) a month.A c c o r-
ding to their performance, they can move up into
the elite of “consultants”, whom they accompany
on visits to customers. As well as on-the-job trai-
n i n g, they take courses to fa m i l i a rize themselve s
with the latest technological developments.
But competition in the computer industry is
fie r c e .M a u ri t i u s , with its small businesses and low
ove r h e a d s ,o f f e rs relat i vely cheap serv i c e s. H owe ve r ,
over the horizon in India, for example, rival firms
can find even lower cost labour.
Using its association with A n d e rs e n , DCDM is
keen to expand its activities beyond Mauri t i u s.
Already it is in charge of maintaining the Botswa n a
g ove rn m e n t ’s computers. It has also written for the
World Bank an integr ated computer progr a m m e
to run development projects in Kenya , Ta n z a n i a
and Uganda.
“ A f rica is a big market of the future,” s ays Yo n g .
DCDM recently opened branches in Madagascar,

it has captured substantial data processing and
s o f t ware business—mainly checking, va l i d ation and
management of data from multinational companies
like P & O Nedloy d , DHL and Mentor Computers.
By sending their data processing work to coun-
t ries like Sri Lanka, these multinationals are sav i n g
about 70-75 per cent of their costs. M e a n w h i l e ,S ri

Viet Nam: d i v i n g
in at the deep end
The government has launched an ambitious
p roject to develop information technology. B u t
local conditions are not quite ready for it yet
example, receives orders from companies like Bri-
tish Gas, Shell and British Petroleum and then
sends them overseas on a sub-contract basis. “We
h ave always been dependent on interm e d i a ri e s ,”
s ays Dharm ava s a n . “But now our aim is to esta-
blish direct links with our clients so that we can
increase profits.The market is extremely competi-
t i ve , and if we quote higher rates our orders will
automatically go to India or the Philippines.”
Low overheads and 
import duty exemptions
At present, there are sixty small and medium-
sized data processing and software companies in
S ri Lanka.They had a turn over of around $25 mil-
lion in 1998. E x p e rts point out that they are no lon-
ger hindered by problems of transmitting their wo r k
(via Internet) since the state has invested in moder-
n i z ation of the country ’s telecommunication sys-
t e m s.They also benefit from low ove r h e a d s ,e xe m p-
tion from customs duty on computer and software
i m p o rt s , and above all from the availability of cheap
labour. Data processing professionals earn an ave-
rage of $600 a month (compared to $3,500 in deve-
loped countries). But the industry would be gro-
wing faster were it not for the relative shortage of
skilled IT professionals.
This shortage of human resources is the coun-
try’s major handicap in relation to India. “In this
respect our neighbour is ten ye a rs ahead of us,”
D h a n a n j ava Chandrasekera, J K C S ’s software direc-
tor, points out. “At present we have 95 professio-
nals,” Dominic adds. “We badly need another fifty
e m p l oyees right away, but unfort u n ately it is not
easy to get computer graduates in Sri Lanka.” Sri
Lanka produces about 200 computer graduates a
year whereas the gr owing industry needs at least
1,000 professionals, and so companies are now tur-
ning to well-trained diploma holders from private
institutions.To get hold of competent staff, JKCS
has made an agreement with the National Institute
of Inform ation Technology (NIIT), a noted Indian
computer training centre which recently opened
branches in Colombo and Kandy, in the south of
Sri Lanka.
“The computer business is the only field in
which a young Sri Lankan professional can start
out earning $600 a month and double or even tri p l e
his earning power within a matter of months,”
Dominic explains. “More and more Sri Lankans
are turning to computers and this augurs well for
the future.” ■

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
The country is relying pri m a rily on its brainpo-
we r.The Vietnamese are renowned in Southeast A s i a
for their mat h e m atical and computer skills. “ O u r
students have a definite talent,” s ays Michel Mouys-
s i n at , head of the French-Speaking Wo r l d ’s Institute
for Computing (IFI),“ but they enjoy tinkering more
than working on complicated programmes which
need teamwo r k .”
N g u yen Kim Anh agr e e s :“ We ’ ve got quite good
technicians but we don’t have enough designers of
complex systems,” she say s.This is why the gove rn-
ment is trying to lure home Vietnamese computer
technicians who have gone to live in the West.The
a u t h o rities are also stepping up efforts to have
researchers trained in Europe,North America and
A u s t r a l i a .And along with help arriving through aid
o r g a n i z ations like IFI, the Vietnamese educat i o n
m i n i s t ry is encouraging the establishment of special
c o u rses at the National Unive rs i t y, at Ho Chi Minh
City Unive rsity and at Hanoi’s Polytechnic School.
Viet Nam has another advantage:its cheap but
A “high-rise”smart car
exhibition centre.
■
If you look at the adve rtisements of any car
m a n u fa c t u r e r , their most striking feature is
the vehicle the firm wants to sell you.Its qua-
lities are presented in all kinds of ways designed to
whet the customer’s appetite—its gleaming body-
work (for people who like an eye - c atching product),
its reliability (to attract careful dri ve rs ) , its size (for
the family motorist), its sobriety (to curry favour
with the environmentalists; the throaty roar of its
e n gine to excite roadhogs.The product dictates the
message.
A d ve rtisements for the so-called “ s m a rt ” c a r
( a lways deliberately written with a small “s”) are
doing exactly the opposite.There is nothing on the
c over of the smart car brochure except a tiny phrase
right in the middle of the page which says in ver y
simple letteri n g : “reduce to the max”. This is
understandable for a “car configurator”(the word
“ m a n u fa c t u r e r ” is shunned) which in recent we e k s
has been adve rtising a car only 2.5 metres long
including the bumpers.
The firm’s website is a bit more forthcoming.
The first page has two sentences each dominated by
a huge “P”—“A product with a philosophy ” a n d
“A philosophy with a product”. Hans Jürg Schär,
head of sales and marketing, calls it “ t wo - t h i r d s
product and one-third philosophy”.
What may turn out to be a revolution in a sec-
tor which symbolizes the industrial world began
with an observat i o n , an inventor and a colossus.
The observation was that on journeys through

trained workforce. “A technician is recruited at a
s t a rting salary of $250 a month,” s ays Mouyssinat .
But the market tends to push the good ones into
h i g h e r - p aying jobs, blunting their competitive edge
in relation to other poor countries. Foreign com-
panies grab the best technicians, who can negotiat e
salaries of about $800 a month after a few years.
In relation to their foreign competitors , l o c a l
firms have one handicap: politically and economi-
cally-imposed restrictions on high-speed phone
c o n n e x i o n s.The gove rnment wants to keep control
of the flow of information and the Internet service
provider in Viet Nam is a public firm with a mono-
p o l y.This means “a line supporting a 64 K modem
speed costs $3,500 a month,” s ays Michel Dau-
g u e t , a multimedia publisher in Hanoi who ru n s
the Pacific Rim company. “And even at that price,
we still don’t have access to all our foreign part-
n e rs. This hampers our business of re-export i n g
software.” ■

t owns for work reasons, only one car in five had
someone in the front passenger seat and only one in
ten had anyone in the back.
So the developers of the “smart”came up with
a car which,they say, “generously”has two seats in
front and,“after studying the problem”, no seats in
the back. This mini-car also takes up only half a
parking space, thus easing an infuriating problem
for urban motorists.
The inventor is Nicolas G. H aye k , the Swiss
designer of the Swatch,which shook up the watch
i n d u s t ry. Without his “ideas and determ i n at i o n ” ,
s ays Schär, the project would have stayed on the
d r aw i n g - b o a r d . It is not surp rising that the little
car seems so much like a toy or a ball, coloured and
a d j u s t a b l e , whose ow n e rs can change its body
panels whenever they like.And it was Hayek who,
by putting his “dream world”on the table,persua-
ded the colossus—Mercedes—to help set up the
new firm Micro Compact Car (MCC).
The personal mobility concept
This alliance of inventiveness and established
k n ow - h ow might have simply produced something
which was ori ginal and technically sound. But MCC
s ays it is selling much more than that . It offers a “ p h i-
l o s o p hy ” in the form of a serv i c e : “ p e rsonal mobi-
l i t y ” .
The bu yer gets a car with four wheels at a pri c e
which includes a package of guarantees, m a i n t e-
n a n c e , r e p a i rs , insurance and easy payment term s ,
but all manufa c t u r e rs make similar offers these day s.
The difference is that the owner of a “ s m a rt ” a l s o
Brazil: a three-tier system
■
To keep the smart car’s price about the same
as its ri va l s , despite its advanced technology, t h e
vehicle’s “configurators” have, among other
t h i n g s , altered the standard process of car design and
manufacture.
S u p p l i e rs whose role was once limited to
making small parts designed by the car-maker,h ave
become partners in the car’s conception and pro-
duction to the extent that the biggest among them
now turn out whole sets of parts in the assembly
plant itself.
This kind of amalgamation is ve ry unusual
because the ve rtical division of tasks and the hierarchy
it creates are still the rule in the automobile industry,
e ven if things are less ri gid than they once we r e . I n
B r a z i l , for example,where an investment of $20 billion
is expected to produce three million vehicles in 2003,
there is a kind of three-tier manufa c t u ring system.
The big multinational car-makers simply assemble
vehicles locally using parts supplied by sub-contrac-
t o rs belonging to the second and third tiers of the sys-
tem—some firms manufacture the parts and others
m a n u facture components for those part s.
g e t s , from the moment of purchase and progr e s s i ve l y
thereafter special access to a range of public and pri-
vate transport to make up for the car’s limitat i o n s
where distance and passengers are concern e d .T h i s
includes trains and planes,as well as cars for a larger
number of people to make the occasional long tri p.
And that ’s not all. H ayek is dreaming of an eve n
cheaper car than the “ s m a rt ” (which costs about
$10,000)—one that pollutes less, has more mechani-
cal innovations and can be used in an even more revo-
l u t i o n a ry way. He wants to start a kind of joint ow n e r-
ship system, or car-shari n g, where the owner only
uses it for ve ry brief periods when he or she really
needs it.
In fa c t , potential purchasers are being asked,
according to the advertising, to “drop old habits”
which are still so cumbersome, in fact give up the
idea of car-owning in the traditional sense,with all
the social significance of ow n e rs h i p, and to just
acquire a serv i c e .M e r c e d e s , the colossus, d i s a gr e e d
with Haye k , the inve n t o r , about that , and they
recently parted company. ■
One spare parts manufacturer is PRW A u t o-
m o t i ve , an A m e rican multinational with a $360-
million annual turnover and 2,900 workers spread
over eight plants in Brazil.“Our parts are designed
in association with the car-maker,” s ays Helder
Boccaletti,the firm’s marketing director. “We take
p a rt in project deve l o p m e n t , we design the part and
then pass on instructions to our components sup-
plier at the tier below.”
Metalpó is one of these suppliers which comes
into the picture at the end of the chain of com-
mand, far from the point of design.It is one of the
ve ry few companies which surv i ved the opening-
up of the Brazilian car market to foreign competi-
tion in the early 1990s. At its factory in São Paulo,
it has 200 wo r k e rs who produce an $18-million
annual turn ove r , only 10 per cent of which is
exports. Fifteen years ago, two-thirds of its custo-
m e rs were car assembly firms and the rest we r e
p a rts manufa c t u r e rs.To d ay the proportions are the
other way round. ■

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
■
How has advertising changed
with the emergence of the immaterial
economy?
There is a crisis in advertising.The industry is
l a g ging behind social trends, but it’s so rich and
powerful that it’s very difficult for it to change.
In the early twentieth century adve rtising focused
on a company ’s buildings and machines.After that it
s t a rted presenting products.T h e n , since all products
s t a rted looking alike, they could no longer be at the
h e a rt of the message.So in the 1960s adve rt i s e rs star-
ted showing leggy models to sell cars.The long legs
offered added va l u e .The product took a back seat
and what was sold was a symbol.The problem with
this technique is that the message is always based on
c o n s u m e rs ’s h o rtcomings and makes them feel guilty.
It tells them,“if you have n ’t got this product, yo u ’r e
out of it.” On the other hand, if you buy a cert a i n
brand of sports shoes you can play like Ronaldo eve n
if you can’t kick a ball.
A second technique is repetition. P r o f e s s i o n a l s
think people remember a product if they see the same
commercial over and over again.T h at dri ves up costs.
But all the commercials end up looking so much alike
t h at you don’t know which brand they’re adve rt i s i n g
a ny more.Who wins? The companies with the biggest
g u n s , in other words the most money.Who pays? T h e
c o n s u m e r ,because on average adve rtising accounts for
15 per cent of a product’s sales pri c e .People in the ri c h
c o u n t ries sink hundreds of millions of dollars into
a d ve rtising eve ry ye a r. It doesn’t make sense any
m o r e .The system is so sick it’s not going to be around
much longer.
Why should it change?
Because consumers are smarter than adve rt i s e rs.T h e
system worked as long as people were really interes-
ted in the products, because they needed them. B u t
t o d ay, in the rich countri e s , they own enough shirt s ,
swe at e rs and television sets for three entire lifetimes.
So they consume less and better: more trave l , m o r e
c u l t u r e .T h e y ’re also ve ry we l l - i n f o rmed and much
more demanding. They think before bu y i n g . A n d
m a ny people, s t a rting with yo u t h , think that consu-
ming is a way of integr at i n g .They buy certain pro-
ducts to be accepted by society or their community.
They take refuge in an imagi n a ry wo r l d , while their
l i ves are full of fear and unhappiness.
How should advertisers adapt to these new
consumer patterns?
They have to be more creat i ve , but the adve rt i s i n g
i n d u s t ry couldn’t care less about creat i v i t y. It wa n t s
to perp e t u ate the system to keep on living off it.T h e
fact is that adve rt i s e rs must explain the client com-
p a ny ’s philosophy. If they’re successful, c o n s u m e rs
will work out for themselves that the products are
g o o d . To capture their at t e n t i o n , a d ve rtising must
become an artistic product in itself, like a play or a
fil m .T h at has never happened because the only
things that condition the industry are money and
marketing managers , who are idiots. All they know
h ow to do is repeat what ’s already been done.
To be successful adve rtising has to disconnect the
message from the product and forget about marke-
t i n g, which standardizes eve ry t h i n g . I don’t do the
same thing other people do. I use products to focus
on the major problems besetting humanity. I ’ ve
p r oved that it can be profit a b l e . Since I’ve been wo r-
king for Benetton, the company has gr own tenfold.
A d ve rtising people hate me but they have to admit
t h at I’ve wo n . ■

The art of advertising
Customized messages
Christian Blanchasse is the producer of Culture Pub,a television programme broadcast on Fra n-
c e ’s M6 channel, and the director of the weekly CB News Communication. He agrees that
advertising is facing the emergence of a new economy of abundance and more demanding, b e t t e r-
informed consumers. But he is also aware of the transition to an individualistic society and increa-
sing audience and media fra g m e n t a t i o n .“ Twenty years ago everyone was watching the same two
or three television channels. It was easy to develop a single message intended for the whole popu-
l a t i o n .Today society and families are split up.”This situation has led to the growing importance of
direct marketing on mass campaigns.“Advertising is adapting by trying to understand people bet-
ter in order to send them customized messages. More and more specialized companies are polling
individuals and trying to figure out their personalities by overlapping all the information about
them that they can get their hands on.” Blanchasse predicts that new technologies will increase socie-
t y ’s fra g m e n t a t i o n .Yesterday shopping was a family affair.To d a y, “on Internet the individual is the
one who chooses and makes the purchases.The world is changing.” ■

People are wo rried about the fa r - r e a c h i n g
transformation of the economy. Are we hea-
ding for “the end of wo r k ” predicted by the
A m e rican economist Je r e my Rifkin? He and his
s u p p o rt e rs say we have reached the end of the road.
We are no longer creating jobs in industry and auto-
mation is sure to reduce their number in the ser-
vices sector.The quantity of work is thus inexorably
bound to decrease.
This thesis may be popular, but it is also mistaken
and harm f u l .H i s t o ry shows that technological inno-
vation has always created jobs on a large scale. In no
way is the current trend leading to “the end of wo r k ” .
Just the opposite: the new economy contains huge
pools of new jobs which can more than make up for
the inevitable loss of traditional jobs.
Dematerialization—the shift away from mate-
rial products—is revolutionizing all aspects of
work—its nature, its organization and its relation-
ship with other activities. Its function is no longer
just the manufacture of physical objects but the
handling of dat a , images and symbols.The content
of jobs is becoming more abstract.Skilled workers
need to know a lot more about mathematics than
their fat h e rs or gr a n d fat h e rs did. E ven milking cow s
and manufacturing require more and more calcu-
lation,evaluation and control.
Financial markets
that never sleep
The organization as well as the product of wo r k
is also becoming increasingly intangi b l e .The unity
of time, space and action which characterized wo r k
in the industrial economy has disintegr at e d .Work is
no longer a regular eight-hours-a-day, five-days-a-
week routine. New rhythms have appeared—the
hectic pace of financial markets which never sleep,
the ups-and-downs of life in show business and the
u n c e rtainties of “ j u s t - i n - t i m e ” production where
components are delivered a few moments before
the final product is assembled.
The new jobs are quitting familiar workplaces
such as fa c t o ri e s , offices and wa r e h o u s e s.Te l e wo r k
is increasing. E u r o p e ’s telewo r k e rs may number 10
million by the year 2000, up from one million in
1994.
This upheaval of worktime and workspace is
going hand in hand with a functional explosion.
The range of skills and types of work is expanding
The advent of an ‘intangible’ economy does not mean the end of work.
But it does mean the end of familiar routines and rhythms, of job security,
of rigid hierarchies and career planning

The knowledge economy When ideas are capital
all the time. In the United Stat e s , the number of
job cat e g o ries has risen from eighty in the 1940s
to nearly 800 today. At the same time, trades are
dying out faster and fa s t e r , especially in inform at i o n
technology where many jobs have a short life of
only a few ye a rs. Jobs are becoming simultaneously
more evanescent and more pervasive, more disso-
c i ated and more integr at e d . On the one hand, f r a g-
m e n t ation in time and space seems to be more
e x t e n s i ve than it was in the industrial economy. O n
the other,information technology is strengthening
the links between different stages of work and crea-
ting an overall fluidity.
Disparities in
productivity
The new forms of work are non-linear. When
handling inform at i o n , k n owledge and feelings,
there is no direct relationship between the amount
of effort and the final result. This makes for ve ry
wide disparities in productivity. In industry, t h e
r atio of the performance of an average worker to
that of a good one is no more than one to five.But
in immaterial work, an excellent programmer can
be a hundred times more productive than an ave-
rage one.
Non-linear work means non-linear organiza-
tion.The notion of a rigid,formal hierarchy based
on unchanging cri t e ria no longer makes much
s e n s e .All that mat t e rs now is technical, s c i e n t i fic or
artistic skill and the ability to establish a solid rela-
tionship with the customer. Functional hierarchy is
replaced by what Thomas Stewa rt , a journalist with
the A m e rican monthly magazine Fo rt u n e, c a l l s
“ b r a i n p owe r ” — a u t h o rity gr av i t ates to those who
c r e ate and control the new stock of intangi b l e
a s s e t s :d at a , brand image, t e c h n o l o gical know - h ow
and human capital.
The new techniques for managing human
resources are individualizing the assessment of per-
f o rm a n c e .Two people doing the same job may have
different salaries and different stat u s. A u t o m at i c
across-the-board pay rises are being dropped and
replaced by bonuses linked to results.There are no
sinecures in the new business enterprise,either for
r a n k - a n d - file employe e s , s u p e rv i s o rs or techni-
cians—the supposed benefic i a ries of the new know-
ledge economy.
Business leaders are no longer a protected spe-
cies.The head of a big American firm is ten times
more likely to be sacked for poor performance now
than was the case twenty years ago.The notions of
l oyalty and of indissoluble links between a firm and
its employees are losing their meaning.
The changing nature of work has led to a big
increase in so-called non-typical jobs, i n c l u d i n g
p a rt - t i m e , t e m p o r a ry and flexi-time work and
s h o rt - t e rm contracts.Almost all the jobs created in
Europe between 1992 and 1996 were part - t i m e .
This trend wo rries many observe rs who see it as
hidden under-employment or disguised unem-
ployment.But they are overly pessimistic.
The growth of non-typical jobs is the result of
the convergence of several persistent deve l o p m e n t s.
  w o r k
Charles Goldfinger*
Learning
is the key
More jobs are needed,but “nothing indicates that the
new flood of innovations will make work in general
less tedious and alienating,” says Bruno Tr e n t i n , f o r m e r
secretary-general of Italy’s General Labour Confederation
(CGIL). Trentin,who heads the CGIL’s projects committee,
agrees that “fordism”—mass production standardized with
the help of a technological monopoly, is “dying”. But he
says that “ t a y l o r i s m ” , the equivalent arrangement in the
labour force, “where all knowledge is in the hands of the
decision-maker and the worker does not have to think or
know anything,is still going strong.
“Behind all the talk and the public gestures, the old
style of management continues. It can delegate some res-
ponsibility to workers but notably without recognizing their
basic right to training and retraining,which is becoming a
crucial part of any employment contract.So things are way
behind here,and the big danger is that new technical forms
of division of labour will arise.”
On the one hand will be “those with access to know-
ledge and ability to control the processes of learning,” and
on the other “the excluded,who will be even more subor-
dinate in the workplace and will be divided up and parti-
tioned off, even in work which seems highly-skilled.
“A fir m ’s long-term interest is to improve the quality of
its work force”so it can take advantage of technological
p o s s i b i l i t i e s, b u t , says Tr e n t i n ,“in the short term, why invest
in someone who is only staying six months in a job because
of labour fle x i b i l i t y ? ” So “if we want an employment policy
based on a level of education and knowledge which are
being constantly renewed, we mustn’t count on marke t
forces or the goodwill of companies.” ■

Where the new jobs are
The shrinking number of jobs in traditional sectors of the economy seems to be a general and
irreversible trend. In rich countries as a whole, the share of industrial jobs fell from 28 per cent
in 1970 to 18 per cent in 1994.
M e a n w h i l e, the share of the services sector grew steadily. Four major new sources of jobs can
be identified:
Handling information and knowledge: computer services, research and development,
teaching and training account for 40 per cent of knowledge worke r s. These high-intensity know-
ledge activities comprised 43 per cent of all new jobs created in the United States between 1990
and 1995,but only 28 per cent of total jobs.
Information technology: here there is a shortage of personnel.Professional groups are
sounding the alarm and calling on governments to help. In the European Union countries, the
imbalance between supply and demand is such that half a million jobs are waiting to be filled.
The health sector: the growth of high-intensity knowledge services in this field is related
to increased life expectancy and the ageing of the population,and the demand for physical and
psychological well-being is also steadily increasing. The growth of expenditure on health is per-
sistent and widespread.For the OECD countries as a whole, this spending grew from 3.9 per cent
of GDP in 1960 to 7.2 per cent in 1980 and 8.4 per cent in 1992.
The leisure economy: this has triggered the expansion of cultura l , sporting and leisure ser-
v i c e s. It ranges from amusement parks and rock concerts to cultural events such as opera and major
art exhibitions.The products of the culture industries have become mass consumer items. Never
before have people read so much, listened to so much classical music or visited so many museums.
Information technology is also going to add to this vast range of consumer choice. In southern Cali-
fornia and New Yo r k , the entertainment and multimedia professions are among the main sources
of new jobs. In Los Angeles, film- and television-related activities created 40,000 jobs between
1992 and 1997,and Hollywood became the city’s main employer. C. G. ■
In the labour market, the increase in non-typical
jobs is one of the ways in which employe rs are
responding to the pressures of competition and
adapting to a global economy which functions
s e ven days a we e k ,t wenty-four hours a day.To cope
with the new situat i o n , firms are having to figure out
h ow they can use their wo r k e rs more efficiently and
flexibly.
The gr owth of non-traditional jobs is also due to
changing demand. Consumers want to be able to
buy a very wide range of goods and services at the
drop of a hat , or amuse themselves any time, a ny w-
h e r e . To meet this demand, shops and places of
entertainment have to be open late at night and on
S u n d ay s.Technology encourages this trend: the vir-
tual economy of the Internet never sleeps.
The widening range of types of work also
reflects long-term demographic trends, especially
the greater number of women workers and longer
life expectancy. Some see non-typical jobs as a
n e c e s s a ry evil, while others , especially women with
children, welcome the change.
The divide between traditional kinds of wo r k
and the new jobs is no longer wat e rt i g h t . Pe o p l e
are increasingly switching back and forth between
the two cat e g o ri e s. In the course of a lifetime, a
p e rson may change from full-time to part - t i m e
work, from an office job to home office and from
the security of a big firm to the adventure of entre-
preneurship.
Changes in the nature of work are also brea-
king down the rigid frontiers which marked off the
world of wo r k . The traditionally distinct fields of
wo r k , e d u c ation and leisure are now interwove n
and coexist flexibly in a kind of triple helix of social
life.
The emerging intangible and relational eco-
nomy has a huge potential for growth because it is
not bound by the constraints of material scarcity.
However, the transition to the new economy is an
open-ended process. The state has a key part to
p l ay in bri n ging it about. G ove rnments can slow
down the rate of change by making it more painful
and more costly.
Obstacles 
to change
Pessimistic scenarios are still plausible,such as
that of an economy which generates few new jobs
and is polarized between a small elite and the rest of
the population who are marginalized and live in
precarious conditions.There is a big risk that this
s c e n a rio will come to pass because current law s
and regulations, as well as widespread pessimistic
ideas about wo r k , are powerful obstacles to change.
Optimistic scenarios require a wholesale reform of
institutional structures and profound changes in
b e h aviour and at t i t u d e s.Such far-reaching changes
often run into strong opposition from the social
and political establishment and come up against
the weight of psychological and social tradition.
But the gamble of a new approach to work must
be made if the transform ation to the intangible eco-
More and more jobs involve measurement,evaluation and control.

Some women’s groups consider prostitutes as victims; others regard them 
as ‘sex workers’ with rights
■
“Ever since the Chinese declared ‘To
get rich is to be glori o u s ,’ wo m e n
without connections, brain power or
money have been using the only asset ava i-
lable to them for quick money. Equipped
with a room,a bed,a supply of condoms, a
red light—and voila—instant brothel. . . .
These girls can make much more money
at $30 a customer, than $4 per day in the
fa c t o ri e s. As is (the case) in almost eve ry
u n d e r d e veloped country ! ” according to the
International Sex and Red-Light Guide.
Sold for $30, the guide “ i n s t ru c t s ”m e n
on where to find cheap sex around the
wo r l d .This is a business ve n t u r e ,a c c o r d i n g
to the authors, where the only principle is
getting the most for your money.“If one so
chooses to use her body in this manner, in
lieu of social slave ry at the hands of pove rt y
e m p l oye rs , and men are willing to pay them
more than slave labour wages,so be it.If it
is not your body and not your life,it is also
not your bu s i n e s s. Until [someone] can
c o rrect the whole wo r l d ’s economic condi-
t i o n , as well as the ove rp o p u l ation problem,
someone has to pay the bills.”
But who? The poorest, the most vulne-
rable? There is no denying that the sex indus-
t ry has taken on intern ational dimensions,
recognized as an economic motor for many
c o u n t ri e s , p a rticularly in A s i a .The irony is
t h at prostitution is not entirely legal.Wo u l d
l e g a l i z ation reduce some of the inequalities
and abuse suffered by the women invo l ve d ?
Or by legitimizing prostitution, would we
r e ve rse decades of work to promote human
rights and improve the status of wo m e n ?
An acrimonious debate
On the surface this looks like a rehashing
of a timeless debat e .But it isn’t .The question
is no longer about morality—is prostitution a
vice and are those invo l ved evil or somehow
lacking in judgment? We now ask: is prosti-
tution a form of exploitation to be abolished
or an occupation to be regulat e d ?
This has proven to be one of the most
divisive issues among women’s groups
around the wo r l d .There are basically two
camps—those seeking to eradicate prostitu-
t i o n , like the non-gove rnmental Coalition
Against Trafficking in Women and prosti-
t u t e s ’ rights gr o u p s , p ri m a rily based in the
N e t h e r l a n d s , the United States and England,
who view the women invo l ved as “sex wo r-
k e rs ” . There is considerable acri m o ny bet-
ween the two. For example, the Coalition
maintains that these groups generally repre-
sent the interests of the “pimps and procu-
r e rs ” . In rebu t t a l , the ri g h t s ’ groups main-
tain that the abolitionists are locked away in
the ivo ry towe rs of academic feminism, c u t
off from the day - t o - d ay realities facing pros-
t i t u t e s.
The dividing line between the two camps
lies in distinctions between so-called “ f r e e ”
Should prostitution be
l e g a l?
In the Netherlands, prostitution is legal for European Union residents.

and “ f o r c e d ” p r o s t i t u t i o n . A b o l i t i o n i s t s
generally maintain that the vast majority of
women are forced into prostitution,while the
sex wo r k e rs insist that this is not necessari l y
the case. But as both point out, for different
r e a s o n s , these distinctions ove rsimplify the
i s s u e s.The 12-year-old Nepalese girl sold to
an Aids-infested brothel in India clearly neve r
consented to this form of slave ry.The dru g -
addict in New York who must fulfil a quota of
clients to get a fix from her pimp is not free to
make decisions concerning her body. B u t
w h at of the Ukrainian woman who looses her
job and decides to go to Germ a ny to work as
a maid but ends up in a brothel?
For the Coalition, “the distinctions bet-
ween free and forced prostitution obscure
the powerful structural socio-economic
conditions—like pove rt y, m a r gi n a l i z at i o n ,
lack of opportunities and prior sexual
a bu s e — t h at often dri ve women and children
straight into prostitution situat i o n s ,” s ay s
Aurora Javate de Dios of the Coalition’s
A s i a - Pa c i fic branch.“Economic cri s i s ,n at u-
ral disasters , political unrest and confli c t
s i t u ations make women and children more
vulnerable and easy prey to sex traffickers
and recru i t e rs.We see this eve ry w h e r e ,e s p e-
cially in developing countries of the South.”
For Javate de Dios, l aws aimed at distingui-
shing between free and forced prostitution
will never recognize the complex dynamics
i nvo l ve d .The most they can possibly do is to
identify the most extreme forms of coercion,
while ignoring the impact of pove rty and
implicitly legitimizing pat riarchal relat i o n-
s h i p s.
The line between free and forced prosti-
tution also we a rs thin on the opposite side of
the spectru m , according to Lin Chew,a for-
mer spokesperson for the Fo u n d at i o n
Against Trafficking in Wo m e n , a non-gove rn-
mental organization based in the Nether-
l a n d s. “When does anyone make free deci-
s i o n s , especially in the labour market? A man
who works in a chemical fa c t o ry, w h o s e
wages will never get him over the pove rt y
line—did he choose this way of life? A n d
w h at about the woman whose backgr o u n d
n e ver afforded her the chance to develop any
skills? W hy should this question of free
choice only apply to prostitution?”
There is, h owe ve r , one point on which
the two camps agr e e : d e c ri m i n a l i z at i o n .I t ’s
time to repeal laws used to punish prostitutes
in seeking to protect public decency and
o r d e r. B e yond this, the two camps dive r g e .
For abolitionist groups like the Coalition,
women are victims, but anyone who profit s
from their exploitation deserves punishment.
For the prostitutes’ rights gr o u p s , h owe ve r ,
Manila prostitutes sail out to ships moored
offshore.
Prostitution and the law
■ According to the 1949 UN Conve n t i o n
for the Suppression of the Traffic in Pe rs o n s
and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of
O t h e rs , which has been rat i fied by 72 stat e s :
“prostitution and the accompanying evil of
the traffic in persons . . . are incompatible
with the dignity and wo rth of the human 
p e rs o n ....”Pa rties agree to punish anyone who:
“procures,entices or leads away, for pur-
poses of prostitution, another pers o n ,e ve n
with the consent of that person”;
“exploits the prostitution of another per-
s o n ,e ven with the consent of that pers o n ” ;
“keeps or manages, or knowingly fin a n c e s
or takes part in the financing of a brothel”;
“ k n owingly lets or rents a building . . . f o r
the purposes of prostitution”.
In practice, governments have develo-
ped three basic legal fa m e works concern i n g
prostitution:
Prohibition . The act of accepting pay-
ment for sex and sometimes paying for sex
is illegal and punished. This is the situa-
tion,for example,in the Gulf States and in
most of the United States.
C ri m i n a l i z at i o n .The law forbids cert a i n
activities related to payment for sex rat h e r
than paid sex itself.These activities include
soliciting for clients,a d ve rt i s i n g, living off the
e a rnings of prostitutes, r e c ruiting prostitutes
or helping them to circulate from one coun-
t ry to another.This is the most common legal
f r a m e work for commercial sex throughout
We s t e rn Europe, I n d i a , Southeast A s i a ,
C a n a d a ,Australia and the Pa c i fic and most of
L atin A m e ri c a .
R e g u l at i o n r e f e rs to exceptions to cri-
minal law made for those parts of the sex
i n d u s t ry which comply with certain condi-
t i o n s. In the case of female sex wo r k e rs ,
such systems are often linked to manda-
tory health checks.
Some examples:
In Brazil , prostitution is not illegal bu t
it is illegal to operate a brothel,to rent pre-
mises to prostitutes, exploit children or live
off the earnings of a prostitute.
In Canada , the law does not prohibit
the act of prostitution but criminalizes a
wide range of related activities like solici-
ting, living off the earnings of prostitution,
operating premises,etc.
In Denmark , it is not illegal to prov i d e
sexual services so long as prostitution is not
the main source of income (in which case
the charge is va gr a n cy ) .R e c ruiting is illegal.
Greece and Turkey have both legali-
zed prostitution.Women must register and
attend clinics for regular examinations, in
some cases as frequently as twice weekly.
In India , despite the many laws against
the sex industry and traditional caste-bound
p r o s t i t u t i o n ,prostitution and trafficking is still
c o m m o n . Conditions are ve ry bad for those
i nvo l ve d .
In Senegal , it is illegal to aid, a b e t , p r o-
cure or live off prostitution earnings or run a
b r o t h e l . Female prostitutes must regi s t e r ,
c a rry cards and have regular medical exams.
Most women take part in the informal sector.
Enforcement is we a k .
In T h a i l a n d , it is illegal to be a prostitute
or to live off a prostitute’s earn i n g s.H owe ve r ,
the laws are not consistently enforced. ■

you cannot help sex wo r k e rs by forcing their
e m p l oye rs undergr o u n d . But you can try to
l e vel the playing fie l d — t h at is ensure that
these wo r k e rs are protected from occupat i o-
nal hazards and receive fair treat m e n t .This is
probably the latest chapter in the debat e :t h e
role of the stat e .
Here we find two camps within the pros-
t i t u t e s ’ rights gr o u p s.One branch pushes for
complete decri m i n a l i z at i o n ,t h at is no regu-
l ation of the industry, while another support s
l e g a l i z at i o n . “ L e g a l i z e d ” prostitution refers
to a wide range of situat i o n s. It can simply
mean that prostitution is not against the law.
More often the case, t h o u g h , l e g a l i z ation is
s y n o nymous for regulat i o n , with laws enfor-
ced by police. Licenses can be issued, f o r
e x a m p l e , with mandat o ry health-checks.
Zoning laws may set up “eros centres” r e m o-
ved from residential areas. If brothels are ille-
g a l , it might be an offence for two prostitutes
to work out of the same house.A n t i - p i m p i n g
l aws may oblige a prostitute’s lover to prove
t h at he or she is financially independent.
Standards can also be set for the wo r k i n g
s p a c e , a s s u ring for example, sufficient ligh-
t i n g, quality mat t r e s s e s , fire precautions and
air supply. L aws can assure that a woman is
not obligated to drink alcohol with a client.
While appropri ate tax brackets can be set up
for earnings and rights to health insurance
and retirement ensured.
In theory, these regulations are intended
to protect prostitutes. But some do just the
o p p o s i t e , according to sex worker groups like
the US-based COYOTE, which calls for
complete decri m i n a l i z ation of prostitution.
Government-run brothels “would be the
p r o s t i t u t e ’s wo rst nightmare,”according to a
COYOTE position paper. “I can think of
nothing worse than having to work for a
bu r e a u c r at—especially in the sex industry —
where there is already a long and well docu-
mented history of abuse by the police. . . .
Perhaps brothels are an ideal situation for the
male clients—a man gets to go to a place
where all the women are lined up waiting to
be chosen—but it is an extremely uncomfor-
t a b l e ,d e grading situation for wo m e n . . . .”
As for licenses, they “do nothing to
ensure the safety of either the customer or
the prostitute.T h at is not to say that wo m e n
shouldn’t have frequent medical checks—
they should,” according to COYOT E , i n
reference to complaints that women are
t r e ated like cattle by health inspectors in
poorly equipped fa c i l i t i e s. “Just as a res-
taurant will lose its reputation if the food
isn’t fresh and its customers become ill,so
will the free market regulate the health stan-
dards of working women.”
For the Coalition Against Trafficking in
Wo m e n , the debate over the role of the stat e
is simply a way of stonewalling the real issues.
The term “sex wo r k e r ” d o e s n ’t dignify the
woman invo l ve d , it dignifies the pimps, p r o-
c u r e rs and traffickers. “ W h at prostituted
women must endure in their ‘ e m p l oy m e n t ’i s
w h at in other contexts would be the accepted
d e finition of sexual harassment and sexual
a buse in the wo r k p l a c e ,” according to Ja n i c e
R ay m o n d , of the Coalition. “Does the fa c t
t h at a fee is paid transform this abuse into a
‘ j o b ’k n own as ‘commercial sex wo r k ’ ? ”
Courses in sex work
R aymond points to cours e s , available for
a fee in the Netherlands, on how to do sex
wo r k ,c ove ring eve rything from role-play i n g
sessions in bars to and inform ation on tax
b r e a k s. “ W h at young girl would you encou-
rage to become ‘ s k i l l e d ’in this trade? W hy is so
much attention paid to promoting the ‘ t r a d e ’
and nothing done to help women get out of it?
Because its easier to believe that prostitution
is a choice for these wo m e n . . . . If the issue of
choice must be raised, let it be raised in the
context of the men who buy the sex of prosti-
t u t i o n .W hy do men choose to buy the bodies
of millions of women and children, call it sex,
and seemingly get tremendous pleasure lite-
Getting rid
of land-mines
without getting
hurt
Anti-personnel mines have killed or maimed
more than 26,000 people around the world. I n
C a m b o d i a , one out of every 200 people is an
amputee because of them.
A treaty banning the use, s t o c k p i l i n g ,p r o d u c-
tion and trade in anti-personnel mines signed by
130 countries (40 of which have ra t i fied it so far)1
will become binding international law on 1 March
1 9 9 9 .The agreement also calls on the signatories
to destroy the 100 million or so landmines scatte-
red all over the world.The problem is how to do it
at the lowest risk to human lives.
A Spanish fir m ,G T D, is currently leading a consor-
tium of European enterprises and institutes invol-
ved in a $25 million project to develop an A d va n c e d
Global System to Eliminate Anti-personnel Land-
mines (ANGEL), partly funded by the European
Eureka programme to promote collaboration in
research and development. “ We ’re not offering a
magic solution,” says the GTD project manager.
“ There aren’t any in this fie l d .But the point about our
system is that it brings together several different
t e c h n o l o g i e s,” including robotics, satellite observa-
tion and the latest electro-magnetic detection sys-
t e m s.
The method GTD is developing relies on geo-
g raphic data provided by satellites and an unman-
ned vertical take-off and landing aerial vehicle
equipped with special sensors to identify mine-
free fields and areas where there may be land-
mines.
The next step is carried out on the ground by a
l i g h t ,m a n o e u v rable unmanned all-terrain vehicle
which can enter minefields in order to locate and
identify each single explosive device. A n o t h e r
v e h i c l e, in this case driven by a mine disposal spe-
c i a l i s t , is then sent to deneutralize the mine from
the safety of the vehicle some 50 or 100 metres
a wa y. Previous methods involved a high degree of
risk for mine disposal officers, who had to work
very close to the mines they were neutra l i z i n g .
The ANGEL system will not be completely ope-
rational until the year 2004.The first testing of it
has been done in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a t
Tuzla, whose university is among the 15 institu-
tions associated with the project,along with lea-
ding European aerospace firms including Matra
(France) and Germany (Dornier),and the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the Uni-
ted States. ■

Europe’s
quandary
In Western European countries such as Germany,
prostitution is legal—but only for European Union
r e s i d e n t s. The restrictions are intended to combat
t rafficking in women—whereby criminal networks
smuggle women and girls from one country or region
to the next,exploiting them as prostitutes or domes-
tic labourers. Eastern and Central Europe have repor-
tedly surpassed Asia as the prime source of this traf-
fic k i n g . In Germany, 80 per cent of the estimated
10,000 tra f f i c ked women are from this European
region,according to the International Organization
for Migration.
While these women may have chosen to migra t e
as prostitutes for economic reasons, few are prepared
for the abuse frequently encountered. Not only are
they driven further into debt,but some are deprived
of their passports, ra p e d , sold to clubs and pimps,
while others face threats to their families at home if
they don’t comply.
The laws barring these women from legally wor-
king as prostitutes were supposed to combat tra f f i c-
k i n g .Yet according to women’s groups on both sides of
the legalization debate, they have done more harm
than good.They drive the women further underground
as illegal aliens. In 1997, for example, German autho-
rities reported finding 1,500 tra f f i c ked women—95
per cent of whom were deported. ■

40 The UNESCO Courier - December 1998
The media explosion left traditional Indian puppetry without a leg 
to stand on, but now a revival may be on the way
All h a n ds o n s t a g e !
■
Chalapathi Rao learnt how to handle
puppets even before he learnt his
alphabet. In the last five decades, he
and his troupe have staged innumerable
puppet shows in India and other parts of
the world including twenty-three perfor-
mances in Germany and two in New York.
To d ay, the fif t y - e i g h t - year-old artist from
the southern Indian state of Andhra Pra-
desh makes ends meet not by his art i s t ry
but by selling lampshades and small han-
d i c r a f t s. “ We used to gi ve as many as fif-
teen performances a month during my
fat h e r ’s time,” he recalls.“ N ow we only per-
form for four months a year and go no fur-
ther than our neighbouring villages. For the
rest of the time we survive by selling han-
d i c r a f t s.” Rao is one of the thousands of
once popular traditional puppeteers in the
Indian sub-continent who have been swe p t
away by the mass media explosion.
A popular art form with a long tradi-
tion in India,puppetry seems to have been
first mentioned in the ancient Tamil epic
S i l a p p a d i k a ra m (second century BC). It has
been and still is an effective tool for com-
m u n i c ating religi o u s , political and social
messages. Puppeteers, who always moved
around from place to place, mostly used
ancient Indian epics like the R a m aya n a a n d
the M a h a b h a ratha as their themes, a n d
their shows were a regular feature of reli-
gious and local festivals, wedding celebra-
tions and social gatherings. Style and pre-
s e n t ation differed from region to regi o n .
Puppetry enjoyed royal patronage, and as
its popularity spread across oceans many
Southeast Asian nations adapted the art
form to their own cultures and traditions
(see box page 42).
Known as Thollu bommalata (Dance of
leather puppets) or Bommalattam (Dance
of dolls) in south India and K atputhli ( s t ri n g
puppet) in nort h e rn India,puppets enthral-
led audiences the moment they came alive
to the accompaniment of song and music.
N ow, as in the past, the puppeteer narr at e s
a story, manipulates the figures,gives each
character an appropri ate vo i c e , and care-
fully choreographs sound effects and move-
m e n t .A successful puppeteer needs to have
a thorough grasp of poetry, history, philo-
sophy, religion and music. Puppeteers also
sing to the accompaniment of musical ins-
t ru m e n t s , speak several languages, a n d
bless the event and the surrounding area
by quoting from religious scriptures. Once
upon a time,p e r f o rmances began after sun-
set and lasted for hours , sometimes all night
long.
The strength of puppetry is in its inter-
a c t i ve quality. It is a live medium with a
personalized approach. Puppeteers some-
times invent their own stories,improvising
from the basic plot a complex network of
i n t ri g u e s , r o m a n c e s , wa rs , m a gic and
comedy.The use of local dialects and sto-
ries makes for an immediate and direct rap-
p o rt with the audience, with whom puppe-
teers often converse through their charac-
ters.
Payment in kind
To d ay puppetry occupies a far less signi-
ficant place on the Indian cultural scene than
it did in its glorious past. No institutions or
u n i ve rsity courses are dedicated to puppetry,
and puppeteers learn their art either through
family tradition or simply because they
become interested in it. I n d u s t ri a l i z at i o n ,
u r b a n i z ation and the advent of modern mass
m e d i a , especially films and television, h ave
inevitably put a damper on traditional and
folk forms of art worldwide and Indian pup-
p e t ry has been no exception. Fe ature fil m s
and modern dance performances have repla-
ced puppet shows in the village festiva l s.T h e
phenomenal gr owth of satellite television in
the last two decades has kept children and
adults alike glued to the screen. ( O f f i c i a l
r e p o rts in 1995 estimated that there we r e
about forty million television sets in India,
and that the figure was gr owing at the rate of
10 per cent annually).
According to Dadi Pudumjee, p r e s i d e n t
of the Indian branch of the Union Intern a-
tionale de la Marionette (UNIMA),an inter-
n ational non-gove rnmental organizat i o n ,
p u p p e t e e rs in the past were rewarded by vil-
l a g e rs in cash or kind (e.g. ri c e , ve g e t a b l e s
and clothes), in addition to their fee.“ T h o s e
customs have disappeared now and puppe-
t e e rs could not surv i ve on their earnings alone
( b e t ween $5 and $20 for a perform a n c e ) .T h e
a rri val of the modern media also brought a
need to improve the production quality and
content of these puppet show s. Unable to
change with the times,m a ny traditional pup-
p e t e e rs vanished from the scene.”

Local l a n g u a g e s
blossom 
in Europe
Anew milestone has been reached in the reco-
gnition of Europe’s local cultures and lan-
guages. Germany, which officially acknowledges
the existence of six minority languages within its
borders (including Danish, Sorbian and North Fr i-
s i a n ) , ra t i fied in September 1998 the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and
France has announced it will follow suit.
The charter, adopted in 1992 by the Council of
E u r o p e1, aims to protect and promote regional
European languages as aspects of a shared cul-
t u ral heritage. There are about forty such lan-
guages and the charter has so far been signed by
eighteen countries and ratified by eight2.
Fra n c e ’s decision has delighted more than four
million of its citizens who speak Breton,Basque,
C a t a l a n ,O c c i t a n ,D u t c h ,A l s a t i a n ,C o r s i c a n ,C r e o l e
(in the overseas provinces), Tahitian and Kanak
(in the Pacific territories).France has been extre-
mely centralized since the Jacobins imposed their
ideas during the Revolution and is almost the last
bastion in Europe of official and exclusive mono-
lingualism.
Article two of the French Constitution states that
“the language of the country is Fr e n c h .”The dialect
of the Paris region was imposed on the rest of
France many years ago to the detriment of the other
l a n g u a g e s.
“ The war is over,” the French daily newspaper
L i b é r a t i o n announced happily.“ The signing of the
European charter eases outdated antagonisms.”
Will it be possible to be tried in a French court in a
regional language or ask for official documents to
be written in one’s local tongue? This is unlike l y.
European countries which ratify the charter can
choose not to apply about half the hundred or so
of its provisions. The French government has not
yet said what it will do. So far, only Finland has
announced it will apply the charter in its entirety.
Another country which has dragged its feet is
the United Kingdom, which could now follow
France and Germany and give special status to
Welsh and Gaelic. ■

ditional puppetry.At these eve n t s , the inter-
action and exchange of ideas between tradi-
tional and non-traditional puppeteers for the
d e velopment of the art resulted in assimila-
tion of styles and emergence of new trends.
A rtists came up with fresh ideas. S h a d ow
puppetry incorporated masks, mime and
classical dance form s. Some puppet art i s t s
introduced martial arts and new lighting
techniques into shadow puppet shows.

C h i n a ’s
love affair with
f o o t b a l l
Until a few years ago, a first division football
match in China would draw no more than
thirty-odd spectators and the total take at the
gate would be around six dollars. But things have
changed drastically since the founding in 1994
of a professional football league, which now has
twelve teams, including forty-eight foreign
players.
The stadiums are filling up week by week and
television stations give live coverage of national
games, along with the highlights of Italian,Spa-
n i s h , English and German championship matches.
China’s best player last year was a Paraguayan,
Jorge Luis Campos, who played in his country’s
World Cup team.And,even more extraordinary,
China has begun selling players to European
clubs.
As in Japan,whose team played in the World
Cup in France for the first time in 1998,China’s
recent love affair with football “is closely connec-
ted with the country’s opening up to the outside
w o r l d ,” says Yong Qun Li, the Paris correspondent
of the “Chinese Young People’s Newspaper”.
Money has something to do with it.The best-
known clubs have budgets of up to $5 million
and the championship, which is sponsored by
many companies, is revealingly called the Marl-
boro League.The transnational cigarette company
Philip Morris has managed to muscle in on a
strictly-regulated market which,with 350 million
smokers, is one of the biggest in the world.
But China’s national team needs many more
hours of training before it can say it has really
arrived. This could happen during the first World
Cup to be held in Asia,which will be jointly hos-
ted by South Korea and Japan in 2002.
As Casiano del Valle, the Paraguayan forward
for the capital’s Beijing Gouan team,says,“there
are some very good players in this country, physi-
cally and skills-wise. But they need to improve
their tactics.”
After fast food, portable phones and Coca
C o l a , China seems to be discovering, t h r o u g h
sport,new aspects of life in the West. ■
■ There are four kinds of puppets in
I n d i a — g l ove or hand puppets, rod pup-
p e t s , s t ring puppets and shadow puppets.
Hand or glove puppets, as their name sug-
g e s t s , are wo rn on the hand and manipulat e d
by the art i s t ’s fin g e rs. Rod puppets are
controlled with rods manipulated by the
p u p p e t e e r , who is hidden from the audience
by a screen. S t ring puppets gi ve more fle x i-
bility to the artists as the dolls are attached to
a string above and a screen divides the pup-
peteer from the puppets.The traditional sha-
d ow puppets of south India are intri c ate flat
figures made from goat or bu f falo hide by
skilled craftsmen.They are projected onto a
translucent screen by means of a strong
source of light from behind. The audience
sits on the other side of the screen and does
not see the puppets but their moving sha-
d ows on the screen.
Patronized by kings and lords, p u p p e t ry
t r avelled beyond India as early as the sixth
c e n t u ry A D.The ancient Indonesian art of
s h a d ow puppetry known as wayang kulit is a
unique combination of ri t u a l , teaching and
e n t e rtainment using figures which are styli-
zed representations of the ori ginal leat h e r
puppets from India. Most Indonesian sha-
d ow plays are based on the two epic stori e s
from India, the R a m aya n a and the M a h a b-
h a rat a.The Balinese and Javanese have com-
bined the Hindu stories with Buddhist and
Muslim ideas and their own folklore. E ve n
T h a i l a n d ’s nang ya i s h a d ow play has its ow n
ve rsion of the R a m aya n a. ■
basic styles and techniques are visible in
the work of these contemporary artists who
h ave dared to break age-old barri e rs of reli-
gion and language. Eminent Indian art cri-
tic J.N. Kaushal says that “those who kept
their windows open to new ideas and expe-
riments have made great strides and those
who were unwilling to change have shown
signs of decay.”
Pulling strings 
to improve health
Some non-traditional puppeteers have used
p u p p e t ry as an effective communicat i ve tool
as well as an art form . For example the Uni-
ted Nations Development Progr a m m e ’s
South Asia Pove rty A l l e v i ation Project spon-
sored puppetry training programmes for
community wo r k e rs in Andhra Pradesh in
1 9 9 7 . As part of the project two one-we e k
training programmes in the use of puppetry
were conducted at the Nori A rt and Puppe-
t ry Centre in Hyderabad, the state capital.
The programme helped around fifty com-
munity wo r k e rs from southern India to learn
the art and use it to popularize social mes-
sages like wo m e n ’s empowe rm e n t ,health and
family planning. After their training, t h e s e
community wo r k e rs went back to their vil-
lages and made hand and rod puppets to per-
f o rm new stories and songs adapted to them.
P u p p e t ry is being used as part of similar pro-
jects sponsored by a number of agencies in
other parts of India in order to create awa r e-
ness of issues like Aids and alcohol abu s e .
Though puppetry shows are not
making a sensational come-back, they are
again being enthusiastically welcomed both
in rural and urban areas. There have been
suggestions that puppetry should be intro-
duced as a subject in schools in India, but
this has yet to mat e ri a l i z e . Once considered
a “dying art”,Indian puppetry has started
a slow revival but still has far to go before
regaining its former glory. ■

Internet users are among the world’s
most closely observed specimens of
h u m a n i t y.Consultants and marketing
e x p e rts scrutinize them, monitor their
desires and anticipate their reactions, f o r
they know the future of the inform at i o n
e c o n o my is in their hands. D ata about them
is everywhere.
But the character of the Internet (or
Net) user is changing all the time. In the
v i rtual wo r l d ’s Stone A g e , in the 1970s, t h e
Net was the preserve of a tiny, ve ry uniform
group of specialized researchers. G r a d u a l l y
it spread to a rather wider group of univer-
sity people and computer experts.
D u ring the “Bronze A g e ” , which ended
with the invention of the World Wide Web1
in 1992, the typical “netizen” was easy to
describe. He was a highly educated, com-
f o rt a b l y - o f f, English-speaking white male
around thirty years old,living in a town or
c i t y. This is still pretty much true today.
Netizens are still mostly young A n g l o -
Saxon adults with some kind of higher edu-
cation earning about $50,000 a year.
“This image is out of dat e ,” h owe ve r ,
says Frenchman Christian Huitéma, who
works for the US telecommunications firm
B e l l c o r e .“As time passes, the typical Inter-
net user is becoming more and more like
the average citizen.This trend is bound to
continue.”
S e veral recent developments confirm
his analysis. First there has been a tremen-
dous influx of women into cyberspace.At
the beginning of 1994, only five per cent of
I n t e rnet users were wo m e n . To d ay the
figure is 38 per cent, according to surveys.
Their initial absence is easily explained.
“The Internet first developed among engi-
n e e rs and technicians, few of whom are
wo m e n ,” s ays Huitéma. C h ristine Maxwe l l ,
of the Internet Society, says that “because
of the kind of work most women do, they
h ave less opportunity to connect to the Net
from their workplace.But they are logging
on more and more from home as computer
prices drop.”
This ye a r , according to several sources,
more women than men have become Net
u s e rs for the first time. Some 52 per cent of
people who have been connected for less
than a year are wo m e n . But the situat i o n
varies greatly around the world.In Europe

Worldwide reports that the Internet is gr o-
wing twice as fast in Latin A m e rica than
a nywhere else: it grew by 788 per cent there
b e t ween 1995 and 1997, while globally the

IDC admitted it was “ s u rp ri s e d ” at the
expansion of the Internet in China, w h i c h
by 2001 is expected to be second only to
Japan in number of people connected.
New languages 
on the Web
The entry of people from the South into
cyberspace has introduced new languages
to the We b , and this is an atttraction for
n o n - E n g l i s h - s p e a k e rs.All studies show that
people prefer connecting to sites in their
own language, e ven if they know English

dominated almost all the Web. Now it only
accounts for three-quart e rs of it, a c c o r d i n g
to a study by the Agence de la Francopho-
nie,which monitors use of the French lan-
guage.

is the gr owth of translation progr a m m e s

Did you know that from two to eight per cent of the earth’s living species will disappear over the next
t w e n t y - five years? Or that all ten of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last fifteen years?
And that nearly 130 million hectares of land—the equivalent of the combined area of France, Italy and
Spain—can no longer be used for food production,due to degradation?
These alarming facts are brought to our attention by the three on-going United Nations conventions on
biological diversity, climate change and desertific a t i o n .Adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, they each
have their own respective secretariats and their own specific objectives and commitments but share a
common concern for many environmental and sustainable development issues. While each instrument
stands on its own, the secretariats of all three aim to achieve greater progress through a collabora t i v e, i n t e r-
linked effort.For example, combating desertification reduces net carbon dioxide emissions, land degrada-
tion and the loss of biodiversity.
This vast panorama is now covered in a joint three-in-one website, with a comprehensive NGO Trialogue
which serves as a focal point for comparing, co-ordinating and consolidating NGO activities and information
related to the three conventions.Each of the three conventions provides related links to individual NGOs and
other sites within the United Nations system. ■
and South A f ri c a , a quarter of all Net users
are women, compared with 25 per cent in
Brazil and New Zealand and 40 per cent
in the United States. In the Middle East,
the figure is only four per cent.The virtual
world closely mirr o rs the real one where
equality between the sexes is concerned.
But Maxwell thinks things will change:
“In Saudi Arabia, which has barely begun
to connect up to the Net, women are not
a l l owed to dri ve motor ve h i c l e s. But they’r e
d riving along the inform ation highway, a n d
that will change a lot of things.”
The Internet is also increasingly popu-
lar with young people. Student Monitor
m a g a z i n e , which does a survey each ye a r
of American students’ favourite pastimes,
s ays nearly three-quart e rs of those asked
said Net-surfing was the coolest thing to
d o. Up until now, their favo u rite activity
has always been beer dri n k i n g . In the coun-
t ries of the South, new Net users are yo u n-
ger than elsewhere. In the Middle East and
Asia, the average user is under thirty.
Americans a minority 
among Net users
The trend towards younger users goes
along with a slight fall in the level of edu-
c at i o n , especially in the United Stat e s.
There are fewer Master’s degrees and
Ph.Ds among Net newcomers than among
the “ e x p e rts”—those who have been on line
for more than four year s. The newcomers
also cover a broader range of activities:
fewer than one in ten works in computers,
compared with one in three in 1994.They
are also a bit less well off: only 30 per cent
earn more than $50,000 a year, as against
50 per cent four years ago.
These socio-economic shifts are cou-
pled with changes in the geography of the
Internet.The US research firm Emarketer
says 1998 was a landmark in the history of
cyberspace. For the first time, Americans
became a minority among Net users. I n
1 9 9 5 ,t wo-thirds of all Net users were A m e-
rican.
But Europe still lags behind and the
continent is not geared to catch up, s ay s
Fo rrester Research, a firm which predicts
t h at in 2001, only 13 per cent of Europeans
will be connected to the Net compared
with 40 per cent in the United Stat e s. I t

Another change under way is the trans-
f o rm ation of the Net user into a cy b e r -
c o n s u m e r. Until now, he or she has been
mainly interested in finding inform at i o n
and contacting other people—witness the
huge success of discussion forums and chat
gr o u p s. N ow, people are starting to use the
Net to go shopping. In the United States,
more than a third of users have already
bought something on the Net, a c c o r d i n g
to Nielsen Media Research. A quarter of
all A m e ricans who want to buy a car have a
look at manufa c t u r e rs ’ sites and those of
consumer groups.
Net-shopping is getting to be a habit in
other countries too. S u rveys in France,
New Zealand and South Africa show that
b e t ween 60 and 80 per cent of Net users are
interested in it, e ven if only a few have
actually bought anything yet.Their hesita-
tion comes from doubt about the security
of payment methods, unwillingness to fill in
purchasing forms for fear of where the
information might end up, and reluctance
to have anything to do with goods they can-
not actually touch.
The domain 
of the wealthy
The “netizen”is becoming an unexceptio-
nal figure as the Internet reaches more and
more people. But the trend towards uni-
ve rsal Net access also increases cert a i n
i n e q u a l i t i e s , e ven in the United Stat e s ,
where computers cost less and it is cheap to
log on. The US Commerce Depart m e n t
r e p o rted in August that despite the gr ow i n g
number of people who own a computer and
h ave Internet access, l ow-income ru r a l
p e o p l e , single-parent families and those
with less than eight ye a rs of schooling have
little opportunity to connect to it. T h e
r e p o rt also said the ethnic gap was wide-
ning too: 40.8 per cent of white households
h ave access to the Net, compared with only
19.3 per cent of Afro-Americans and 19.4
per cent of Hispanics.
On a world scale,Africa is being sideli-
n e d . Its share of Net users (outside of South
Africa) fell from 0.025 per cent in 1997 to
0.022 per cent in 1998, according to the
World Bank.The typical A f rican Net user is
either a South A f rican or a highly-educat e d
rich man. Tom Butterly, head of the Zim-
b a b we firm Inform ation Management
Consultants,reckons that 700,000 of Afri-
c a ’s barely one million Net users live in
South A f ri c a .The connection cost of about
$65 a month—half a teacher’s salary — i s
still a disincentive. In the rich countries it
costs only about $20.
But Huitéma does not think the Inter-
net will be the domain of the we a l t hy for
much longer. “The Net is eventually going
to spread like television did. I remember
when television arrived in the small village
in Brittany (western France) where I grew
u p. It was a luxury. These day s , you fin d
television sets everywhere,even in shanty-
towns.” ■

Star w a rs
Electromagnetic pollution is clouding our view
of the heavens. Radio waves from a new net-
work of communication satellites may be drow-
ning out emissions from dying stars which take
aeons to reach us.
Alarm bells rang in November 1998 when the
American company Iridium began relaying tele-
phone calls with its flotilla of 66 satellites.
International calls have long been relayed by
satellites about 35,000 kilometres overhead,
which is why only telephones connected to
powerful transmitters can use them. H o w e v e r, I r i-
dium satellites fly just 800 kilometres overhead
enabling customers from Antarctica to 
Timbuktu to keep in touch through special devices
about the size of a standard portable telephone.
But for astronomers, “the transmitters on the
satellites produce unwanted emissions in the
radio astronomy bands used to observe dying and
newly formed stars” and other phenomena,
according to Tom Ku i p e r, a radio astronomer with
N A S A . Kuiper explains that during peak calling
hours, the satellite interference surpasses levels
which the International Telecommunication Union
has defined as harmful to radio astronomy.To clo-
sely monitor an approaching comet, for example,
scientists would have to negotiate with Iridium
for a shut-down of the system to continue cer-
tain key observations during peak telephone
hours.
“Once we understand the magnitude of the pro-
b l e m ,we will see how we can improve our satellites
between now and the year 2006,” says Jack We n-
gryniuk of Iridium’s licensing affairs division. B u t
he also points out that Iridium satellites are just
one part of the problem. Commercial users and
uses of the electromagnetic environment will conti-
nue to rise as the telecommunications industry sky-
r o c ke t s.
“ The radio spectrum may possibly be one of
the most precious resources we have,” he says,
which is why several nations are preparing pro-
posals to set up reserves to protect our electro-
magnetic environment. ■

Counting the netizen population
■ H ow many Internet users are there
worldwide? It’s hard to say. E s t i m at e s
range from 100 to 200 million. It depends on
h ow you define them. “ W h at do we mean
when we talk about Net users ? ” asks Chri s-
tian Huitéma.“ People who have an account
with an ISP (an Internet service prov i d e r ) ?
People who share an account with the rest of
their family? People who log on through
their unive rsity or workplace? People who
visit a cybercafé now and again?”
Net users are counted in different way s.
The traditional one is by totting up the
number of electronic addresses registered
( n ow about forty million). This figure is
then multiplied by a rough estimate of how
m a ny people use each machine (betwe e n
three and five).
Polling firms use another method.T h e y
take a representat i ve sample of the popula-
tion and ask each person if they have logged
on that day, or during the past week or the
past month.“These polls are often localized
and take place over time,” s ays Huitéma.
“The world total is arrived at by adding up
the figures from Canada in June,from the
United States in September,from Japan in
Ja n u a ry, along with guesses for other coun-
t ri e s. I t ’s not surp rising that the global esti-
mates vary so widely.” ■

Why did Apartadó become an extremely
violent city in the early 1990s?
The first thing to bear in mind is the
context of the confli c t . A civil war has been
going on in Colombia for the past fifty ye a rs.
For a va riety of historical and economic rea-
s o n s , the Urubá region in which A p a rtadó is
l o c ated is extremely vulnerable.The arri val of
g u e rrilla and paramilitary groups triggered a
process of extortion and killings, and the

A ve ry significant development came in 1991
w h e n , as a result of negotiations on political
r ather than social issues, the guerrillas of the
Popular Liberation A rmy (EPL) laid dow n
their arms—as the M-19 movement had done
p r e v i o u s l y. This meant that there was no
social amnesty, either on the part of the lan-

How did you come to be mayor of

Violence reached a critical level in 1994,
when the guerrillas decreed that nobody
could stand as a candidate in the municipal
e l e c t i o n s. Only two days before election day,
scheduled for 24 August 1994, the Cat h o l i c
church brought together political organiza-
tions and urged them to take part in the
d e m o c r atic process and not to gi ve way to
the threat of arm s. Discussions began to
decide who should stand.A long list of names
was drawn up, but people were afraid. M y
name was put forward without any wa rn i n g .
There were a number of points in my favo u r:
I knew the region and its people, I was not a
member of any traditional political part y, I
was not an activist in any armed gr o u p, a n d
my approach to work was more technical
than political or part i s a n .The fourteen poli-
tical groups invo l ved reached agreement and
I became the sole consensus candidat e .
You were 34 at the time. Why did the 14
political leaders choose a woman—and a
woman so young—to occupy such an
exposed position in such a violent city?
I don’t think I was nominated because
they thought that a woman could do some-
thing more to solve the confli c t ; it was more
a question of their evading their political res-
ponsibility. In Latin America, a woman in
p ower is still regarded as inoffensive . She is
not expected to bring about fundamental
changes.A woman in a position of respon-
sibility is a figurehead rather than a political
d e c i s i o n - m a k e r. My election was therefore
more the outcome of a special situat i o n
than a planned gesture.When I started to
take a stand on certain issues, within a
month those 14 men left me stranded.
What sort of issues?
I had said that if I accepted the post of
m ayor I would do so without weapons or an
e s c o rt and that I would talk with all the
a rmed gr o u p s , whether they were guer-
ri l l a s ,p a r a m i l i t a ri e s , the army or the police.
This sparked off a reaction nat i o n w i d e
because mayors were not supposed to talk
with armed groups. I started out from the
p rinciple that you do not choose the people
you gove rn , you have to accept them for
what they are, even if they include people
who live beyond the frontiers of society.
There is no such thing as an ideal commu-
nity;every community has its conflicts.
As mayor, you took the lead in the ‘women
against violence’ movement.Did you
decide to surround yourself with women or
didn’t you find any men prepared to take
on the responsibility?
I didn’t recruit wo m e n : they were already
t h e r e ,but they could not express themselve s
because of the confli c t . It is not enough for
women to occupy key posts. E ve ry t h i n g
depends on our attitude to the roles society
e n t rusts to us. In Uru b á , the women used
to be silent. In those three ye a rs ,we began to
mobilize and recover our dignity, our vo i c e s
and our love for our land. But there was so
much death and violence that it was diffi-
cult for us to work out a political agenda.
W h at we could do was get together and, i n
the face of a war devised by men for control

of the country and the economy, m a k e
alliances to halt the killing of our menfolk.
And when I say “our menfolk”, I mean not
only wo r k e rs ,p e a s a n t s ,s o l d i e rs and police,
but also men in the armed groups operat i n g
outside the law, who are also sons,h u s b a n d s ,
l ove rs , men of the people.
During your term of office, 1,200 people
were assassinated and your life was
continually in danger. Were you ever
tempted to give up?
When they killed 17 of my colleagues,
when they slit the throat of a child in school
before my eye s , when I could feel death stal-
king the streets at night and I received threat s
by telephone, when I realized that eve ry b o d y
was a prisoner of fear, I did ask myself whe-
ther it was wo rth risking my life eve ry day.
There were two possibilities: either I could
run away and let all the people be engulfed in
t e rr o r , or else I could tell them: “The only
way out is for us to unite.”When someone
telephoned me and said “ We are going to
kill you at nine o’clock tonight,” I replied:
“ T h at still leaves me seven hours.”This wa s
not heroism. I preferred to live with my fear
r ather than burden the people with it and
let them go on enduring the violence of guns
with sadness and resignat i o n .
I believe in God. I also believe that we
must have sufficient strength to commit
ourselves. Such a commitment cannot be
made in words alone;we have to bear wit-
ness through our live s.The fact that I staye d
in A p a rtadó was not the act of a messiah
promising deliverance but an act of conv i c-
tion,so that my words matched my deeds.
What was your biggest disappointment
during your term of office?
In those three ye a rs , we sounded the
alarm. We used to say that if there was no
political reaction from the gove rnment and
if we did not obtain the support of the
i n t e rn ational community, the things that
were happening in Urabá’s 600 square kilo-
metres would spread to the whole of
C o l o m b i a . But denouncing the situat i o n
was not enough.
My main disappointment is that we did
not give more substance to our task, to all
the projects we started, especially in edu-
cation.Nor did we succeed in making eco-
nomic proposals for the region and in get-
ting the intern ational community more
i nvo l ved in local activities with children,
women and artists.
What is the situation in Apartadó like today?
The Urubá region is no longer a guer-
rilla stronghold but the paramilitaries are
present in considerable force.As long as an
illegal force controls public order,consoli-
dating the democratic process is a distant
p r o s p e c t . The state must regain its legi t i-
m a cy. Make no mistake: if this does not
come about,Urabá will collapse.
Are the government and the guerrilla
groups sincere in the current peace
negotiations?
We are living in a situation of mutual sus-
p i c i o n . The guerrilla groups mistrust the
g ove rn m e n t , the gove rnment mistrusts the
g u e rri l l a s , and civil society mistrusts both of
t h e m .
The defence of the terri t o ry is at stake.
Pa r a m i l i t a ry groups have managed to gain a
wide measure of control over a vast regi o n ,
while the guerrillas claim to be defending the
positions they now occupy, with more than
600 towns in their hands. H e n c e , we are no
longer witnessing guerrilla wa r fare but a tac-
tical struggle for position. In this sense, t h e
n e g o t i ations will invo l ve a new pat t e rn of land
d i s t ri bution and a far-reaching change in the
c o u n t ry ’s economic policies.
What can be expected of these
negotiations?
Neither the Revo l u t i o n a ry A rmed Fo r c e s
of Colombia ( FARC) nor the National Libe-
r ation A rmy (ELN) are talking of disbanding
or handing over their we a p o n s.Recent eve n t s
h ave shown the fragile nature of the peace
p r o c e s s. In October,70 people,most of them
c h i l d r e n , were killed in an ELN attack on an
oil pipeline running from Segovia to A n t i o-
q u i a .A few days later the paramilitaries ri p o s-
ted by marching into two villages that we r e
supposedly harbouring guerri l l a s ,m u r d e ri n g
30 people and abducting 40 others.T h e s e
were offences against humanity and viola-
tions of intern ational humanitarian law.T h e
a rmed groups are making it clear to us that
the negotiations in Colombia will take place
in a climate of confrontat i o n .
If the intern ational community does not
monitor this process in one way or another,
the Colombian conflict will get wo rs e .
Peace does not depend on President Pas-
trana or on the good will of isolated gr o u p s.
What impact has drug-trafficking had on
the situation?

48 The  UNESCO Courier - December 1998
T A L K I N G  T O …
The right to risk
■ “Apartadó’s La Pasionaria”, “Urabá’s
Mother Courage”, “the mayor of
peace”—these were some of the headlines
t h at were used in the Colombian and inter-
n ational press to salute Gloria Cuartas Mon-
t oya when she ended her three-year term as
m ayor of A p a rt a d ó .C u a rtas presents hers e l f
simply as a social wo r k e r. Her invo l vement in
community work began when she was a pupil
at a Carmelite school in Antioquia prov i n c e
and continued at unive rs i t y, where she stu-
died sociology. She says she has always been
“ d ri ven by the need to know what lies behind
the blood and death and to understand the
social and human reasons for the civil wa r.”
S u p p o rted by an unshakable faith in
God and a belief in humanity, G l o ria Cuar-
tas succeeded in making one of the wo r l d ’s
most violent cities known as an example of
civil mobilization for peace.As mayor she
m ay have disappointed those who expec-
ted her to inaugurate public gardens and
highways, but as she says,“the roads to be
built in Apartadó were roads of solidarity,
and the gardens to be planted were those of
tolerance.” In a region where an untimely
word can be paid for with a bullet she tal-
ked to all the armed groups and claimed
the “right to risk”. She put her life in the
balance by refusing special protection, i n
order to show “that weapons could not go
on being a symbol of power or authority”.
C o nvinced that politics is only valid if it
has a “social mission”, she encouraged
Colombian university teachers, professio-
nals and artists to develop educational and
cultural activities so that Apartadó’s  chil-
dren could gr ow up in a climate of tole-
rance and their parents could learn to live
together peacefully. In a city of recent
immigrants,she tried to develop a sense of
collective identity and civic responsibility.
G l o ria Cuartas also made her vo i c e
heard outside her country and won intern a-
tional support for her policies. She told the
world what women were doing in Colom-
b i a ’s conflict areas, denounced human ri g h t s
v i o l ations before the European Pa r l i a m e n t ,
and convened an intern ational meeting in
A p a rtadó attended by women from seve r a l
wa r - t o rn countri e s. She won backing from
UN E S C O and the collaboration of many
NGOs and anonymous vo l u n t e e rs.
All these activities brought her threat s
from guerrillas and paramilitary groups in
Urabá (the Colombian army tried to hinder
her work on several occasions) but also reco-
gnition from her own country (Woman of the
Year in 1995, the Simón Bolívar Medal from
the Ministry of Education) and intern at i o-
nally when the first Mayo rs for Peace Pri z e
was awarded to her by the Director General
of UN E S C O in 1996.She is currently in Cara-
cas (Venezuela) where she is heading UN E S-
C O’s Cities for Peace network (see box ) .H e r
ambition is to contri bute to the advance of the
c u rrent peace negotiations in Colombia by a
“ c o n s t ru c t i ve dialogue”.“ F r e e d o m ”she say s ,
“ b e gins with generosity and self-abnegat i o n .”
■
ployment, poverty and social imbalances,
drug-trafficking is a very important factor,
since it has penetrated to the very roots of
political life and of the guerrilla and para-
military groups. Many peasants live in an
economy based on coca production.I find
it very difficult to envisage any other local
crop replacing this activity and being com-
p e t i t i ve . The FA R C , for example, c l a i m
they could help to reduce illegal cultiva-
tion, but this is not possible in the imme-
d i ate future because powerful economic
groups have created a whole market sys-
tem out of the drug.The United States has
proposed to the Colombian gove rn m e n t
t h at a “peace fund” should be set up
through the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), and one of the key items on its
agenda is the eradication of illicit crops.
This is a long-term problem, h owe ve r.
Any drastic measures could lead to further
conflicts.
Attempts to broker peace are not new to
Colombia. . .
T h at ’s tru e ,but they have been disjointed
and scat t e r e d .They need to be welded toge-
ther in a common project,so that the voice of
civil society can be heard in a negotiated
social and political outcome to the confli c t .
We have to create a sense of awa r e n e s s.T h i s
is the only way to change our attitude to poli-
tics in Latin A m e ri c a . I put my trust not in
politics but in social movements that will pro-
vide education and will gi ve rise to cri t i c a l
t h i n k i n g .The fact is that politicians are not
m a gicians who can change things ove rn i g h t .
They need social movements to back them
u p. In Colombia we are scarcely begi n n i n g
and the current peace process may last five or
ten ye a rs. Our president is over-optimistic if
he thinks that eve rything is going to be sett-
led during his term of office.
When you speak of the support of the
international community, what do you
mean in practical terms?
There are several battle fronts in inter-
n ational solidari t y.There is individual soli-
d a ri t y, in which people contri bute their
k n owledge to back up the anony m o u s
s t ruggle of men and women in different
p a rts of the wo r l d , without robbing the
people of their voice.
There is also the presence of the inter-
n ational community through the United
N at i o n s , whether it is represented by UN I-
C E F,UN E S C O or UN D P,o r g a n i z ations whose
work is of fundamental import a n c e . I saw
this in A p a rtadó with UN E S C O’s support
through its Regional Adviser for Latin A m e-
ri c a . M o r e ove r , the mere fact that the
a m b a s s a d o rs of the European Union accre-
dited in Bogotá visit A p a rtadó or any other
r e gion of Colombia opens up a “ c o rridor of
p e a c e ” in which people can describe their
e x p e riences and ask for co-operat i o n , e ve n
though the conflict has not come to a halt. I n
s h o rt , there are many way s , r a n ging from
individual endeavo u rs to large-scale move-
ments of solidari t y, to let a region know that
it does not stand alone. For a region going
through a cri s i s , solitude is sometimes wo rs e
than having to contend with armed force.
What is your opinion of the more individual
form of solidarity provided by volunteers?
To my mind, it is all-import a n t . It is the
best way of breaking away from the double
moral standard whereby many of those who
attend diplomatic conferences and gathe-
rings moan about the “terrible things hap-
pening in that country ” , but ve ry few
actually go and see what is happening.
Behind every volunteer,there are a host of
N G O s , like the Colombia Support Net-
work (CSN) which grew up in the United
S t ates and has gi ven us invaluable backing.
Hardly a year and a half after you began
The fact is that politicians are not magicians who can
change things overnight. They need social movements to
back them up

T A L K I N G  T O …
Cross-fire in Urabá
Urabá is a fertile but sparsely-populated region
in the northwest of Colombia, on the Carib-
bean coast near the border with Pa n a m a . Since the
1 9 6 0 s, the region’s economy has been based
almost exclusively on banana plantations belon-
ging to big landowners, most of whom live abroad.
U ra b á , which stretches over three Colombian
provinces (Chocó, Antioquia and Córdoba), h a s
always harboured smugglers. It is also a base for
guerrilla movements whose power is largely
u n c h e c ked in an area where the authority of the
state is weak.But above all it is the most violent
region of a country with record-breaking levels of
criminality. Colombia,with a population of 38 mil-
lion,has a violent murder rate three times higher
than Brazil’s and ten times higher than that of the
United States.
U ra b á ’s economic centre is A p a r t a d ó , a city of
almost 100,000 inhabitants, over 1,000 widows
and 4,500 orphans. During 
the three years (1995-1997) when Gloria Cuartas
was mayor of Apartadó,1,200 of its citizens were
m u r d e r e d , including seventeen city officials.Why is
the level of violence so high?
After being kidnapped and ransomed by guer-
rillas extorting a “revolutionary tax” known as l a
v a c u n a (“the va c c i n e ” ) , the big landowners organi-
zed self-defence groups that soon became para m i-
litary militias. The army turned a blind eye to what
was going on. Left to its own devices for over a
decade by the Colombian government, the region is
today reaping the consequences of a war without
quarter between different guerrilla and para m i l i t a r y
f a c t i o n s.W h a t ’s more, the growing number of drug
t ra f f i c kers take sides either with the guerrillas or the
m i l i t i a s, with the aim of chasing peasant farmers
a way and appropriating their land.The civilian popu-
lation is paying a tragic price for these power
s t r u g g l e s. Systematically suspected of helping the
a r m y, the guerrillas or the paramilitary forces, f a r-
m e r s, farm workers and their families are being mas-
sacred by one or another of these groups.The spira l
of violence has produced a nightmare situation.
C o l o m b i a ’s new president,Andrès Pa s t ra n a ,w h o
took office on 7 August 1998,began negotiations
in October with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation A r m y
( E L N ) , the two main guerrilla movements still active
in the country.
In Urabá and other regions, women have spoke n
out to try to halt the killings. In 1996, women from
all over Colombia gathered in the village of Mutata
( U rabá) to take part in a “Road for Pe a c e ”d e m o n s-
t ration during which they proclaimed :“ We refuse
to bear sons and daughters just to watch them
d i e.” ■

meets once a month to analyse the situat i o n
in my country.
What message would you send to women
at the close of the millennium?
We women have succeeded in making
p r o gress as far as our civil, political and eco-
nomic rights are concerned.We have ente-
red the public sphere. However, there are
still many women who go barefoot, some in
the literal sense and others in the intellec-
tual and emotional senses too.
We women have to get ourselves orga-
nized and recover our voices, our dignity,
our intelligence and our role, and stop
being consigned to a role imposed by men,
and assume new social responsibilities.
L a s t l y, we must trust ours e l ves and our
ability to create and transform society
through intelligence and love . I sincerely
believe that this is what we are doing. ■
Interview by 
A. Ortiz de Urbina and L. Iglesias Kuntz
your term of office, you were awarded the
first UNESCO Mayors for Peace Prize. What
did this award mean to you?
Quite simply it saved my life! And it also
s aved the lives of children, wo r k e rs and
artists in Apartadó.The prize gave us the
opportunity to go on standing on our own
feet and to get together to show the armed
groups that in Apartadó there was a living
force which they had to respect.
Could the Apartadó experience be exported
to other regions in conflict?
It is a wo rthwhile experience which
should not be imposed but shared with
other regions that may have different pro-
blems,such as youth gangs,drugs,alcoho-
lism or unemploy m e n t , but which, l i k e
A p a rt a d ó , need to reinvest public life, t o
r e c over dignity and trust in democratic pro-
cesses.We need to publicize this and simi-
lar experi e n c e s , as we are doing through
UN E S C O’s Cities for Peace netwo r k , i n
order to demonstrate that the major crises
in Latin America can be solved with humi-
lity and intelligence, without resorting to
violence and arms.
Do you think there are universal
mechanisms behind violence?
At a meeting with women from
R wa n d a , Bosnia and Palestine and from
other countries in Latin A m e rica which we
organized in A p a rt a d ó , we saw that the dis-
tress inflicted by war is the same everyw-
here.The conflicts were different, but the
common denominator was that there had
been inadequate investment in education,
health and utility infrastru c t u r e .A b ove all,
in all these cases, there was an unfa i r
income distribution policy, which made it
possible for the rich to get richer and left
broad swathes of society in a state of dire
poverty.
You now live in Venezuela.Are you thinking
of going back to your own country?
I am not an exile and I don’t want to be
one. I am living in Venezuela because I am
in charge of a UN E S C O “Cities of Pe a c e
N e t wo r k ” p r o j e c t . But as soon as I can
return to my country permanently to take
part in the peace process,I shall do so.
My stay in Venezuela has also given me
the opportunity to relax mentally and to
“ d i g e s t ” the pain of wa r. The faces of so
m a ny people who disappeared and the
m e m o ry of so much spilt blood remain
engraved in my mind.
Are you still involved in Colombian public
life?
I keep in touch with my country

✒Straightforward language
I have been a reader of the C o u ri e r s i n c e
1 9 6 7 , and my response to the reva m p e d
ve rsion is that all the short but highly infor-
mative articles make good reading. It is a
pleasure,above all for manual workers like
myself, to read articles written in straight-
f o r ward eve ry d ay language. C a rry on along
the same lines and you will win many rea-
ders. At any rate I hope so.
Michel Juignet
President of the French Cobblers’
Association
✒Hope and belief
I and many of my friends are all in favour of
the new Courier.
It is just as interesting as before but it is
more feisty and dynamic. When an inter-
n ational organization professes to defend
and promote human progress and the
values of justice, e q u i t y, dignity and solida-
rity for all—above all the most needy—
within an economic system that tends to
d e s t r oy all these va l u e s , the completely neu-
tral presentation of information known as
journalistic “objectivity” is no longer rele-
vant . . .
This being the case,it is urgent to have
the courage to identify and clearly designat e
responsibilities rather than simply act as an
o b s e rve r.This  is what you have been doing
in your articles since July-August.
So I hope the Courier will continue to
gi ve us reasons to believe and hope in
human beings, something which is today
more vital than ever.

✒Keeping up with change
In our opinion,the new Courier continues
the magazine’s longstanding humanistic
tradition. It is pleasant to look at, easy to
read and its contents are va ri e d . T h e s e
changes undoubtedly match the changing
circumstances and problems covered in
your magazine.

✒L e t ’s hear about health . . .
The innovations introduced into the Cou-
rier show that the magazine is moving for-
ward with our moving planet. For that rea-
son the new format is highly welcome.
But I should like UN E S C O to pay more
attention to the health sector, not because I
am a health service professional but because
here in A f rica we lack fresh ideas in this fie l d .

. . . and sport
The C o u ri e r ’s new form at is extremely
at t r a c t i ve . I like the way the monthly dossier
is sandwiched between feature art i c l e s ,t h e
overall presentat i o n , the quality of the
r e p o rt s , b a c k ground art i c l e s , photos and
other documentary mat e ri a l .All this makes
the Courier an exceptional magazine, pro-
viding a unique window on the world.
As a long-time subscri b e r , I should like
to offer you my congr at u l ations and my
gr atitude for the inform ation and ideas yo u
provide each month.
PS.How about a dossier on sport?

✒Too much Internet
As a subscriber to the UNESCO Courier for
s e veral decades, I am ve ry glad that yo u
h ave changed the form at of your magazine,
which I had more or less stopped reading,
except for a few articles each month. I felt
t h at it was no longer adapted to curr e n t
problems and no longer told me the kind of
thing I want to know.
H owe ve r , I think it’s a pity that you devo t e
so much space to the Intern e t , forgetting how
