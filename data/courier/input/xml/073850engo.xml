Beirut Prepares to receive
Unesco Conference
PREPARATIONS are under way for the opening in Beirut, Le-banon, of the Third Session of Unesco's General Conference on
November 17.Following the decision of the Extraordinary Session of the Con-
ference in Paris on September 15 to maintain the original plan,
adopted in Mexico City last year, Unesco is carrying on its ground

work for the forthcoming discus-
sions in Beirut.
Material is already being turned
out in Arabic, which will be one
of the working languages, in addi-
. tion to English and French. At
least one special issue of the
Unesco Courier will also be pub-
lished in Arabic at the time of
the Conference.
In Beirut, the three halls for
plenary meetings and the meet-
ings of commissions are now com-
pleted, and the entire premises
will be fitted up early this
month.

French Government, and Unesco.
Since the beginning of the cen-
tury. much consideration has
been given to the International
Protection of Nature ; under
Unesco's sponsorship, practical
proposal are being drawn up and
will be given final shape at the

yet their need of it can
never be extinguished..."
In the words of Henry G. Mau-
rice, Secretary of the Society for
the Preservation of the Fauna
of the [British] Empire, man
"living in most unnatural cond.-
tions in crowded cities, has been
pillagin the world not only to
supply himself with the neces-
sities of a natural ex'stence, but
for the creation of the means for
and amenities of a wholly artifi-
cial existence".This way of life leads to reckless
exploitation of the g'fts of natu-
re. A campa : gn must therefore
be launched against the gradual
destruction of the beauty, wealtn
and spiritual values which this
nature lavishes on the human
race.
Two International Conventions
for the Protection of Nature are
already : n force : the London
Convention on African Nature
Protection (1933) and the Con-
vention on Nature Protection anc
Wild Life Preservation in the
Western Hemisphere (1942).
These precedents are a strong
foundation for future work. and
the efforts and achievements of
all community which have given
attention to the problem will
serve as a guide for the Fontaine-
bleau Conference.
At the Unesco General Confer-
ence in Beirut next month, the
Direc : or-General of the Organize-
tion will propose that Unesco
convene in the same place as.
and in co-ordination with, the
United Nations Scientific Confe-
rence on the Conservation and
Utilization of Natural Resources
(UNSCUOR-scheduled for 16
May-3 June 1949 in the U. S. A.)
an International Technical Con-
ference on the Protection of Na-
ture, from 3 to 11 June 1949.

Cheap Radio
Receivers
In Illiteracy Battle
The poss'bitity of producing
simplified radio receivers on
a large scale which would be
distributed directly through
governments at the manufac-
turer's selling price and at a
cost far below current market
prices, was seriously cons'dered
at a recent meeting in Paris
last August of Unesco's Com-
mission on Technical Needs of
Press, Radio and Films.
The proposal, one of the
most important and far-
reaching in the field of edu-
caConai radio, was strongly
recommended by the Commis-
sion as a practical means of
combating illiteracy in the
world today.
The radio experts voiced
their conviction that consid-
eration must be given to the
millions of people who cannot
read or write and whose stan-
dards of t'ving render the pos
session of a radio receiver au
impossibility under present
conditions.
Unesco w'l seek the collab-
ration of radio manufac-
turers to carry out Uhe neces-
say research in the develop-
ment, for example, of low-
cost valves and components,
and in the use of printed cir-
cu'ts calculated to give'satis-
factory performance under
tropical conditions.
Although it is as yet too
early to state the definitp
price of such receivers, the
Commission had in mind that
the selling price level of the
five recommended types of
receivers should be cf the
order of $4.00 00 to $10 and consid-
cred that there is a market
for several millions of recei-
vers which should make such
a project practical.
(See Central Page jor oth cr
details.)
Extraordinary Session, which was
under the chairmanship of Dr.
Francisco del Rio y Canedo, Mex-
ican Ambassador to France, voted
to"maintain the decision of the
Mexico Conference to hold the
Third Ordinary Session of the
General Conference at Beirut In
November unless prevented oy
grave obstacles."The voting was
34 in favour, three against (New
Zealand, Poland and Czechoslo-
vakia). with one abstention (Hun-
gary). Six countries, Boliv'a, EI
Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Uru-
guay and Saudi Arabia) were not
represented.
Another resolution had been
submitted by the Executive Board
as an alternative if the Beirut
choice was to be reversed. It
suggested the convening of the
Third Conference in November : n
Geneva, or the convening of the
Session in Paris in December and
the submission of a proposal that
the Conference adjourn to Beirut
at a later date.
In the debate that took place.
the prevailing view of the dele-
gates was that a change in the
original decision would cause con-
siderable moral prejudice to the
position of Unesco in the world.
and more especially so in the
Middle East. But were the Third
Conference to meet in Beirut, an
excellent opportunity would thus
be available to Unesco to make
itself better known in that part
of the world, and even to play a
conciliatory role in the present
delicate conjuncture.
Commenting on the view on
some-delegates that there were
no political implication in the
issue under review, the New Zea-
land representative. Dr. W. H.
Sutch, said that if this were the
case there would have been no
need for the Extraordinary Ses-
sion, and one had to face the fact
that there was a political element
in the decision.
Tensions No Obstacle
The Indian delegate, Sir Sarve-
palli Radhakrishnan. rejected the
idea that the state of tension pre-
vailing in the Middle East shoulj
prevent Unesco3 from holding its
Third Conference there. There
was, he said, no place on earth
where there was no tension.
"It is argued that the Middle
East today is a hot-bed of in-
trigues, suspicion, misunderstand-
ing and even physical hostilities.
But is it not our duty to go to
a place like that to proclaim our
ideal of humànity ?
"Whatever decision we may
take will be regarded as political
today. We have nothing tr do with
politics. If we are to avoid going
to places where there is political
tension, where is such a place
in the world today ?
"Beirut."he added,"may per-
haps be the meeting-ground of the
intellectual Arabs and Jews and
the General Conference may itself
contribute to the easing of the
tension."

A meeting or the represent-
atives oj twent-eight National
Commissions and of persons
concerned with the setting up
of National Commissions in
the other Member States oj
Unesco will be held on 15 and
16 November, 1948, ; mmedi-
ately before the opening of the
Third Session oj the General
Conference at Beirut.
Included in the Agenda for
this meeting are the following
subjects for discussion-the
role oj National Commissions
and National Co-operating
Bodies in relation to their
Governments and to the Se-
cretariat of Unesco; ; the effect-
iveness oj National Commis-
sions'participation in the 1948
programme oj Unesco ; co-
operation between Commis-
sions and the possibility of
direct exchanges oj visits and
publications between Commis-
sions, and the review of the
action taken by the Secretar-
iat to carry out the Resolu-
tions of the Second Session of
the General Conference on
National Commission.
A jurther meeting of the
representatives will be held
during the closing days oj the
Conference to enable them to
discuss the responsibility of
National Commissions in rela-
tion to the. 1949 Programme
of Unesco adopted by the

LATIN AMERICANS
CO-ORDINATE
SCIENTIFIC WORK
A T the ceremony on September10. in the Great Hall of Mon-
tevideo University, which brought
to a close the first Scientific Co-
operation Conference convened by
Unesco in Latin America, a prom-
inent Uruguayan scientist stated,
amid applause from the govern-
ment and university dignitaries
present :
"This is one of the most im-
portant moments in the history of
Latin Amer'can science."
That exclamation was a tribute
to the efforts of some of the most
distinguished representatives of
science in Latin America who had
come together to draw up plans
for the best ways Unesco coald
help scientific progress in their
countries.
The scientists reaffirmed the
great usefulness of the Unesco
Field Science Co-operation Office
in that region of the world and
agreed on the suitability of trans-
ferring the Office from Rio de
Janeiro, where it had been tem-
porarily set up in 1947. to Mon-
tevideo. Uruguay.

World Cultural Reviews
Brllssels Meeting
Extends Copyright
Convention
By
François HEPP
Head oj the Copyright
Division.
Note- : On the eve oj his departure
for Buenos Aires, where he is to
represent Unesco at the Inter-
national Congress of Authors'
Societieo to be held between 5
and 15 October, M. Franço8
Hepp has kindly recorded for
COURIER readers some or the
resuits at the important Diploma-
ic Conference for the revision of
the Berne Convention which met
in Brussels this summer, at which
he was present as a, Unesco
observer.
UNESCO'S interest in the workof the Brussels Conference
was dictated by the high import-
ance which this Organization at-
taches to unification of Copyright
as a means of dissipating many
international misunderstandings
ar. sing from insufficient know-
ledge among peoples. The Berne
Convention is the first, and an
enduring monument of Interna-
tional Copyr'g t, and a Conferene
for its revision could not fail to
b i, l Unesco's eyes, an event of
the first importance.
From the Brussels conference,
at which there were 35 Member
countries and observers from 18
non-members, the Berne Convent-
ion emergd considerably streng-
thened, and with a greater meas-
ure of unity.
The practical results obtained
may be summed up as foUows :
Inclusion of photographic, cine-
matic, and in cer. ain condit'ons,
"applied works of art,"among the
categories protected ;
agreement on the period after
the death of an author during
wh'ch the"moral rights"may be
exercised ;
important provisions regarding
press publications (including
news-reels) gramophone record-
ings. cinema, and particularly
broadcasting and tetevis'on ;
acceptance of the"continuin
participating right" (droit de
suite) in respect of resales of
works of art.
Finaly ther are three meas-
ures of major importance :
1. acceptance of the principal
that authors'rights be directly
protected by the instrument of
the Convention wihout previous
amendment of national legislat-
'on :
. unanimous acceptanc, of fifty
years as th period during which
an author's work continues to be
protected after his death ;
3. agreement on the long sought
principle that any difference
betwen Member countries regard-
ing the interpretation of the
Convention's provisions be re-
ferred to the Internatonal Court
of Justice.
In addition it was decided that
the text of the Convention be
henceforth drafted in two lang-
uages, French (formerly the
sole language) and Engl'sh,
though the French text shall
be authoritative in cases of dis-
pute.
Furthermore all Member States
may require the Berne Office to
publish an"authoized"text in
heir several languages.

II T is somewhat disappointing to think of thedisproportion between the constant improve-
ment in the facilities for conquer ing space
offered by modern life and the fallure to sur-
mount the barriers to thought presented by diff2r-
ences of language
We can hear the wireless words spoken at the
other end of the world ; we can pass in a few
hours from Europe or America to China, and
admire new countries and works
of art. And yet, if we do not know
the language, we remain almost
as unfamiliar with'the real life,
of a country as if we had never
passed its borders.
What more insoluble mystery is there for a
Frenchman than a book printed in Chinese or
Swedish, or one in Dutch for an Egyptian or an
Indian ? How many fundamental works consist
of nothing more than incomprehensible signs
for people living only a few miles from the place
where they were written ?
Intellectual Exchange
Through Contemporary
Periodicals
And If this is true of the masterpieces of the
past. with names and characteristics of which
we are at least familiar by hearsay, how much
truer is it of contemporary thought, which
nevertheless already contains the embryo of the
future ?
This great problem has not been overlooked
by Unesco, and while the Philosophy and Human-
istic Studies
Division has
oncentrated
on finding
the best
means of
translating
the master-
pieces of the
past. the Arts
and Letters
Division has
undertakes
to bring liv-
ing civiliza-
tions into
touch with
one another,
by concen-
trating on
the form in
which con-
temporary
thought most
readily finds
expression-the review.
That is how the International Literary Pool. was
conceived. Its principal purpose is to establish
an active two-way flow between reviews in all
countries and to serve as an international source
of information and mutual understanding. In
order. to achieve this aim. the Literary Pool
endeavours to offer reviews in different countries
articles which have already been published in
others reviews and which may help them to inform
their readers about artistic or literary movements
in countries of which little or nothing is known.
It was first necessary to obtain an accurate list
of the literary reviews, or those reviews which had
a literary section, in each country. In many
countries almost all the reviews which were
published before the war have ceased, or changed
their character. These lists also have to be
constantly kept up-to-date, as one of the char-
acteristic featurs of our time-and not the
least regrettable-is the uncertain fate of re-
views.
Scheme Enthusiastically
Welcomed by Reviews
In Many Countries
When the lists had been obtained, Unesco
wrcte to each review, asking it to take part in.
the project. Over 300 were approached and 160
have replied. The scheme was enthusiastically
welcomed by 140. who, in their first reply, also
indicated the countries with which contact in
the literary sphere had prover most difficult.
and mentioned the general subjects and the
countries which interested them most.'
In order to understand the interest displayed
by the reviews, the circumstances of literarv
life throughout the wortd and the difficulties of
arranging exchanges must be borne in mind.
People are sometimes inclined to think that
intellectual contacts between
countries are easy ; that is not
by any means the case. Ever-
growing barriers have been built
up by the war and by customs
restrictions. Furthermore, the
interest in the literature of
Jester-known countries-appa-
rent for some 50 years-his
gradually decreased.
These difficulties, which are
By
Gabrielle CABRINI
Arts and Letters Division
Of Unesco
almost insuperable for the reviews themselves,'
may not be so for an international organization.
Reviews have been "paired off"according to
their character and their readers. Literary reviews
offer many diverse nuances in content and
approach. Philosophic, technical and medical
periodicals appeal to a well-defined audience. The
appeal of literary reviews, on the other hand,
ranges from avant-garde readers to the man in
the street, and covers a wide
field from the short story and
the essay to criticism or poetry.
In suggesting the first articles,
the Literary Pool took acount
of the space available in the
reviews, since long articles were for all practical
purposes, unusable in certain countries whicn
had been particulary hard-hit by the war.
The intellectual and practical independence
of almost all literary or artistic reviews is well
known. What is therefore required, first and
foremost, is to offer them articles which do not
represent a particular form of propaganda, but
show what critics,
artists and writers
think of the special
problems of their own
country, and of those
concerning some part
of the world or man-
kind as a whole.
The Pool endeavours
chiefly to concentrate
o n those countries
whose languages are
less familiar :
For example, an ar-
ticle by Rabindranatn
Tagore on the place of music in education and
culture, originally published by the Indian review
"Visva Bharati", was offered to the Ecuador
review "Letras del Ecuador"which recently
published it. Another Indian review,"United
Asia", reproduced. a fine poem on Gandhi's death
by the Brazilian writer, Cecilia Meireles. This
poem was also published in the Lebanese review
"Les Cahiers de I'Est"of Beirut.
One of the principal Egyptian reviews in
Arabic,"EI Kitab", is publishing in its October
issue a long article on the literary unity of Eu-
rope. which originally appeared it the French
review"La Table Ronde", and has already been
accepted in Italy by the review"Rassegna d'Ita-
lia". A French review has published a. short
story by the Dutch writer. Crollius. wich had
appeared in the Dutch magazine"Apollo", The
editors of Turkish and Norwegian reviews have
been sent American and Indian poems.
Since April, some 60 articles have heen accepted
by reviews of differents types in various coun-
tries.
Pool Is Not
A Literary Agency
The aim of Unesco is not to act as a literary
agency, but rather to encourage the cross-
fertilization of ideas between the main cultural
areas of tbe world and thus to make it possible
latter. for reviews to carry out exchanges directly.
In some instances, articles are submitted
already translated and ready for printing, such
as articles in Chinese and Arabic intended for
the rest of the world, articles in Dutch or Polish
for Latin America, etc., etc. Reviews which have
published articles from magazines in another
country have already shown a desire to establish
direct contact with foreign reviews, in order to
consider the possibility of regular exchanges.
Others have asked for and received lists of
foreigh reviews similar to their own.
The problem of copyright, which so often
prevents exchanges, is solved, whenever possible.
in accordance with international commercial
agreement. Where that is not. possible because
of currency
or other duff-
iculties, re-
views ant
writers have
given ev-
dence of sin-
cere under-
standing :
they have
authorized
the transla-
tion and re-
productioa
of articles
without pay-
ment, in order that their thought, their culture
and henc hence their country may e. :establish spiritual
links with ther countries.
The International Literary Pool hopes in the
coming months, with the assis-
tance of other departments
and bureaux in Unesco, to
extend its system for exchang-
ing articles to other fields
which have not so far been
developed, such as films, philo-
sophy and all forms of expres-
sion of thought which are d
mature of periodicals in every
country.
Beirut,
Prepares
Conference
'.
(Continued from Page 1)
The Australian delegate, Col.
W. R. Hodgson, said that the ele-
ments of conflagration existed
when the Mexico decision was
taken and things had not radically
changed since.
"We are a cultural body,"ne
said,"and should not spire'0
handling political questions. Hav-
ing embarked on one course, we
should steer by that course firm-
ly and consistently.. and go to
Beirut."
Pole Favors Geneva
The holding of the Conference
at Geneva was advocated by the
Polish Delegate M. Henryk Bi-
recki, who recalled that when the
decision was taken at Mexico City
to go to Beirut, the United Na-
tions General Assembly was then
discussing the fate of Palestine.
He pointed out that delegates who
voted for Beirut at Mexico City
were unaware of the UN decision
regarding Palestine and could not
foresee that there would be States
which would not apply a decision
taken by the United Nations. The
necessity for the Conference to be
held this year and the fear of a
decision not to meet at Beirut
being interpreted as a demonstr-
ation against the peoples living
in that region vould be reconcil-
ed, he considered, by having the
Conference in a traditionally
neutral country.
The Lebanese delegate, Dr.
Charles Malik admitt8d that the
issue was a political one. But"al-
though it is a political question,
Unesco must be above politics.
"There is an English saying
that you cannot prevent birds
from flying over your head, but
you can certainly prevent them
from building their nests in your
hair. Thus only by being above
Jew and Arab can Unesco, in the
first place serve its own purpose.
and in the second place help
to serve as much as possible Jew
and Arab alike."
Amendment Voted
After the adoption of the reso-
lution two hold the Third Ordinary
Session of the General Confer-
ence in Be.'rur, the Extraordinary
Session unanimously voted an
amendment suggested by the Exe-
cutive Board to modify the rules
of procedure so that :
"In the event of grave obstacles
developing in the course of the
year which. in the opinion of the
Executive Board. render it impos-
sible to hold the General Con-
ference at the place fixed at the
previous Session, the Executive
Board may, after eonsultation
with Member States and if a ma-
jority of them concur. convene
the meeting elsewhere.
It was pomted out oy the Chair-
man of the Executive Board that
the Board regarded itself bound
by the decision taken by the Ex-
traordinary Session to call the
Third Conference in Beirut and
that the Board did not consider
the above resolution as implying
any reservations or any arriere-
pensée such as might give rise to
misunderstandings
The Session then adjourned
until the Third Ordinary Confer-
ence in Beirut. in November.

Vol. I.-No 9. UNESCO COURIER 3
Tiny Lebanon Offers'
'I
Great Cultural Wealthl
The choice of the Lebanonas the seat of Unesoo's
Third General Conference
is a specially interesting one at
a time when a veritable intel-
lectual renaissance is evident
in the seven Arab countries of
the Middle and Near East.
Since ancient t'mes the Leba-
non has been a centre of mter-
national exchange. Archaeologists
and ancient historians teach us
that the first international rela-
tions on a large scale-the
exchange of works of art, com-
mercial and cultural exchanges
were peacefully established by the
seamen and merchants of Byblos,
Tyre. Sidon, Beryte, etc.
These men were bold naviga-
tors who explored the wnole of
the ancient world and set up 600
trading posts from the Gulf of
Guinea to Scotland and from
Gibraltar to the Indies. Their
most certain title to a place In
history is their invention of the
alphabet of 20 consonants and 6
vowels, which has remained
unchanged since then and
which we use today. The first
inscription in this alphabet is on
the tomb of Ah'ram. King of
Byblos in the Lebanon.
Close Arab Ties
It is interesting to note that
even then the Lebanese were
most closely linked with the
countries which are today Arab :
Syria. Iraq, Egypt. Cyrenaica,
Carthage and Morocco.
Later the School of Law of
Beryte, where Ulpian of Tyre,
Papin'an and Justinian were
trained, and which was as impor-
tant as Rome itself in the crea-
tion of Roman law. was for long
the intellectual beacon of the
East.
In modern times the first Arab
printing press was set up at
Choueir : n the Lebanon by
Abdullah Zakher ; there, too.
were produced the first Arab dic-
tionary, the first Arabic daily
paper and play, and the first
grammar of Arabic syntax. The
literary revival which took place
in the Lebanon : n the 19th Cen-
tury spread so swiftly to Egypt
and Syria-indeed in all direc-
tions-that it was directly res-
ponsible for the major cultural
renaissance to which we owe the
polit'cal independence of the
majority of the Arab lands today.
,
Humanistic Revival
It is safe to forecast that the
presence of those countries will
be mcreasingly felt in interna-
tional assemblies. From the cul-
tural, scientific and educational
point of view, it was important.
therefore-indeed necessary-for
Unesco to make direct contact
with the Arab world.
Today there are 250,000,000
men, Arab in civilization, lan-
guage and customs, who seek to
revive the humanistic values
which flowered among them
some centuries back, when Eu-
rope was still sunk in the dark-
ness of the Middle Ages. At that
time the Arabs were the f rst to
translate and annotate the philo-
sophers of Greece : they had
invented algebra and had given
an impetus to geometry, astron-
omy. medicine and architecture
which served as the starting
point of modern science.
/Verve Centers
In the old world the Arab
countries lie along the nearest
marches of the non-European
continents. They are found at the
most sensitive geographical nerve
centres : Gibraltar, Suez, the
Straits ; on the turntable and
meeting place of Europe. Africa
and Asia. Nearly half their coasts
are washed by the Mediterranean
and they have a considerable
coast-line on the Atlantic and the
Indian Ocean.
Unesco, which seeks to encour-
age scient'fic, intellectual and
artistic expression, and a rich
cultural interchange among peo-
ples, underlines by this meeting
its interest n the culture of the
Arabs, just as Unesco's confe-
rence in Mexico last year marked
the importance of Latin Ameri-
can culture.
Much will be asked of the Arao
world because it has much to give
in a field whose spiritual climate is
that of ardour and of faitn that
is the most rewarding path in
these Eastern countries where so
many mystics and rel'ions have
been born. The Lebanon will give

Iran Extérid Its 
Educational Programme
by Dr. A. H. MALEKI,
Delegate of Iran at the Universities Conference, Utrecht.
fThe article printed below is the par-
tial text of an address given by Ur.
A. H. Maleki at the Utrecht Universities
Conference, called by Unesco and the
Netherlands Government early in
August.
RAN possesses a culture and
a history going back for
thousands of years. Evidence
has been found, dating from 30
centuries B. C., of a. ivilization
which extended to the fields of
science, art and architecture.
Iranian culture was profoundly
influenced by th com ! ng of Is-
lam, but at the same time it
spread to all the Islamic terri-
tories. Iranian writers and schol-
are, such as Avicenna and others,
provided Islamic civilization with
its scientific and cultural basis.
The Iranian language was rep-
resented at different times in
our history by celebrated philo-
sophers and writers, whose fame
became world-wide and whose
works were translated into
French, German and English. As
instances, we might mention
works of Khayyam, Haliz and
Nezami.
These men often dealt with
pedagogic problems, and devoted
important works to the education
of young people-Eight hundred
years ago Sahdi, the famous phi-
losopher and author, completed
a work on pedagogic methods. He
wrote :" Men are all members c/
the same body; when one memb-
er is wOunded, the whole body
suffers. He who gives no thought
to the relief of human suffering
is unworthy of the name of
man."
That idea was the soil from
which education has sprung in
our country. The university in
the modern sense of the term,
only came into being in our coun-
try in 1934, But it has existed
before that. Universities and
large schools, the cultural insti-
tutions of Iran, enjoyed immense
prestige in the Middle Ages. They
taught pedagogy, philosophy, lo-
gic, astronomy, medicine, litera--
ture, mathematics and the na
tural sciences. In the Middle Ages
it was the science and education
emanating from these institutions
which led the peoples out of
darkness mto light.
Iran suffered severely from the
war. She  placed her forces at the
disposal of the Allies, and there-
by earned the title of the
"Bridge of Victory". After the
war Iran Jelt the need or opening
fresh universities, chiefly for the
training of teachers and doctors.
Thus, when political order had
been rye-established in the coun-
try in 1947, the Government of
Iran caused a new University to
be epened at Tabriz,

RISSALAT EL UNESCO
Arabic Edition of"Courier"
Published this month
The Unesco Courier will be
published this month in Arabic.
A special edition of this news-
paper, bearing the title"Rissalat
EI Unesco", will be published at
Bart in the second half of
October in honour of the Third
Sesion of the General Confe-
rence. M. Wajdi Mallat, Lebanes*
man of letters and now a mem-
ber of the Bureau of Public Infor-
mation of Unesco, has been
charged with the preparation of
this spcial number.
The form of the Arabic"Cour-
ier"will be similar to that of
the French, English and Spanish
editions. Besides statements and
studies on Unesco's principles,
programme and achievments, it
will conta n articles specially
written for this particular edition
and signed by some of the most
eminent scholars of the Arab
world and the East.
The main purpose of thes* arti-
cles is, on the one hand, to make
the Arab peoples and countries
acquainted with Unesco, and, on
the other hand, to show the im-
portant part to be played by the
Arab civilization in world culture
and in Unesco's work.
Some of the articles will be
published in the November issue
of the French, English and Span-
ish editions, and is hoped that
they will help to strengthen
understanding and cultural co-
operation between the Orient and
the Western World.
only two faculties : letters and
medicine. It is hoped before long
to create. in addition, the other 
faculties which are normally in-
cluded in a university. This insti-
tution is temporarily housed in
buildings which were not desig>l-
ed for that purpose, but provision
has now been made for the con-
struction of special buildings on a
site havmg an area of 200,000
square metres. Th admmistra-
tion of the new university is on
the same lines as that of the
University of Teheran. Le Shahan
the Shah of Iran, has authorized
a grant of 10 million rials (350,000
dollars) for the construction of a
hospital attached to the faculty
of medicine, where students will
be able to engage in practicaf
work.
The foundation of the Univer-
sity of Tabriz has been applauded
by the whole nation, wltlch re-
gards it as a new and important
centre for the diffusion of science
and culture. Azerbaijan has al-
ways, from the most ancient
times, been the religions and
scientific centre of Iran.
It was Zarathustra, one of the
ancient prophets of Iran, who
kindled in the very heart of Azer-
baIjan the sacred fire from which
science and philosophy were dif-
fused throughout the whole coun-
try. This philosophy declared : :
"Darkness and light are in per-
petual conflict with each other; ;
but, in the end, light will triumph ;
truth will expel falsity ; science
will illuminate ignorance."
It is this philosophy which in-
spires our methods of teaching,
and we trust that, with the aid of
great cultural organizations, and
especially with the support of
Unesco, our young university will
attain its full development, and
will succeed in fully accomplishing
its educational mission ; it will
thus become an efficient member
of the world-wide organization of
Universities.

UNESCO SUMS
N 1947 and 1948
Press, Radio, Film Needs
II N 1947 and 1948 Unesco carriedout surveys in a number of
countries to disccver their
technical neads with regard to
the press, radio and film.
Following the spirit of the
Organization's Constitution the
first two sessions of the General
Conference of Unesco held that,
to ensure"full and equal oppor-
tunities for edu-
cation for all.
the unrestricted
pursuit of ob-
jective truth,
and the free
exchange of
ideas and know-
know-ledge"
should lend its ass'stance to"all
means of mass communication".
In 1947. surveys were carried
out in 12 war-devastated coun-
tries, and in 1948 in 6 war-devas-
tated countries and 11 countries
in which the technical means of
mass commun : cation are perhaps
not yet sufficiently developed (*).
By the term"tecrnical needs"
Unesco implies :
(a) Inadequate supplies of raw
materials (such as news-
print, raw film stock) ;
(b) Shortage of equipment
itself;
c) Inadquacy of professional
training.
Fifteen experts on mass com-
munication, invited in their per-
sonal capacity, constituted the
Commission, which met : n August
this year to consider the reports
prepared by the Unesco ecreta-
riat on the press, radio and film
situation in the seventeen coun-
tries covered by the survey.
As in 1947. the experts found
that"if the full capacity of in-
dustry were utilized, production.
throughout the world could, u'ith
the possible exception of news-
print, be sufficient to meet the
essential requirements of the coun-
tries considered"and that it was
"the shortage of foreign currency
which prevented the acquisition
of adequate quantities of raw ma-
terials and the equipment ne-
cessary for the press, radio and
films".
In its general, recommendations
the Commission stressed the vital
importance of cultural and in-
formation needs in the defence of
peace. It gave special emphasis to
the problem of newsprint, and
asked Unesco to draw the atten-
tion of Governments to the im-
portance of expanding the produc-
tion of raw materials and the
equipment necessary for the de-
velopment of the press, radio and

film, and to give such require-
ments a high priority.
The Commission emphasized
the value of developing co-opera-
tion between Unesco and the vari-
ous Specialized Agenc : es and Eco-
nomic Commissions of the Umted
Nations for the assistance of the
diferent countries covered by the
1947 and 1948 surveys. The Com-
mission request-
ed Unesco to ex-
tend such surv-
eys gradually to
cover the whole
world and to
keep them up to
date, so that in
*In 1947, the following countries
were surveyed : Belgium, China, Cz2cho-
slovakia, Denmark. France, Greece,
Luxembourg, Netherlands Norway, Phil-
ippines, Poland and Yugoslavia.
In 1948. the survey was extended to
the following 17 countries : Austria, Bur-
ma, Cuba. Dominican Republic. Ecuador,
Haiti. Honduras. Hungary. India, Italy,
Malayan Union. Mexico. Pakistan. Peru.
Singapore, Uruguay and Venezuela.
a few years
time a complete picture of the
production and development pass
ibilities of all the means of mass
communication could be obtain-
ed. It also requested that the
various plans for assiting coun-
tries where the press, radio and
film are still undeveloped be put
into effect.
In 1947. the three Sub-Commis-
sions-Press and News Agencies,
Radio and Film-had tried in
some cases to calculate the needs
of the surveyed countries, and to,
give a precise indication of the
measure of assistance that should
he carried out.
In view of the existing world
economic situation, and aware of
the financial obstacles to the im-
plementation of such projects, the
members of the second Commis-
sion on Technical Needs this year
indicated to the Unesco Secre-
tariat measures easier to apply
with limited financial resources.
The experts did not this time-try
to state the essential needs of the
countries in question in terms of
Quantities and prices, but emphas-
ized particularly the educative
function of the press, radio and
film, especially in a number of
countries where illiteracy is still
extremelv common, and indicated
a whole series of measures which
the Unesco Secretariat might con-
sider with a view to promoting
effectively, even if not with ma-
terial assistance, the development
of the press, radio and film.
The main points in the recom-
mendations of each of the three
Sub-Commissions will be found
elsewhere on this page.
In conclusion, it may be of in-
terest to mention that the various
reports on the Press and News
Agencies, Radio and Film were
prepared by sending specialists to
each of the countries covered by
the survey ; those specialists were
able to consult not only the offi-
cial services but also experts in
all branches of mass communica-
tion, and thus for the first time
assembled a complete body of
material which was entirely ap-
proved by the experts and govern-
mental representatives of the
countries concerned.
The Conclusions and Recom-
mendations of the Commis-
sion on matters dealing with
news agencies and the press dif-
fered in some respects from those
formulated by their predecessors
in 1947. This was because some of
the countries surveyed this year
were not sufficiently developed to
provide adequate and stable press
organization. In some cases, the
effects of the war were still evi-
dent. Furthermore, the press
being dependent upon the written
word and a number of the nations
under review having a high rate
of illiteracy, the problems of as-
sistance to the press were found,
in some cases, to be more of an
educational character than strictly
one of reconstruction or expansion.
News Agencies
The position of news agencies
was found to be more fluid than
that of the press itself and
generally differed between in-
dividual nations. It was seen
that the importance of these
agencies in the transmission of
foreign news could only be con-
sidered as an integral part of
the Press organization in any
one given country. It was recom-
mended that, in view of chang-
ing circumstances, regular revi-
sion of the factual reports
prepared by the Secretariat
should be carried out. In addi-
tion, the importance of training
journalists who were likely to
become editors In news agencies
was outlined, sine this work had
a considerable bearing upon the
character and scope of news and
information of an international
nature.
Newsprint
One of the most important
subjects dealt with by the Com-
mission was that. of the raw
material for the press, the supply
of newsprint. It was recom-
mended to Unesco that the only
practical method of increasing
the supply was by the restoration
to full production of existing
newsprint mills which are either
idle, operating at reduced rates,
or producing other grades of
paper.
Research and efforts to dev-
elop newsprint production should
be stimulated by Unesco in con-
junction with other international
organizations already active in
this field. There were also recom-
mendations to the effect that
Unesco should use its influence
to point out the importance of
newsprint and paper for other
reading materials. These should
not be considered as an ordinary
commodity, but one or great so-
cial importance in providing in-
tellectual lood for thought.
The provision of equipment to
print in many vernacular langua-
ges was found to be a technical
need zn Asiatic countries. It was
suggested that small, cheap, flat
bed presses would be or greater
utility in many countnes for the
small circulation press than mod-
ern high speed equipment.
Training of Journalists
The education and professional
training of journalists was con-
sidered by the Commission as an
important factor towards a more
responsible press playing a greater
part in removing barriers to it-
ternationat understúnding.
The Commission advised Unes-
co to assist the schools of jour-
nalism in preparing their pro-
grammes based on the experience
of older and well-establishefl ins-
titutions. It was suggested that,
not only by this training, but also
in arranging for interchanges of
working journalists between na-
tions, a more international out-
look might be fostered among
those writing, editing and select-
ing information and news.
The Commission underlined the
recommendation that Unesco
should establish an International
Institute of the Press and Injor-
mation which would help to car-
ry out many of the ideas and
recommendations resulting fro
the Technical Needs Survey. Fi-
nally, it was felt essential that
the three media of Press, Radio
and Film should be considered
together. since in areas with a
high rate of illiteracy, it might
be more effective and cheaper to
use audio-visual means for the
mass communication of ideas and
information, than an zmmediate
expansion of the press facilities.

newsprint consumption (in kilo-
grams) annually per capita of !

Sweden, for example, consume

Cheaper F
For Educa
The Recommendations of theCommission on the subject
of Films stressed the impo
tance of the educational fill
It was found that in the 17 com
tries surveyed in 1948 there w
little prcduction or use of suc
films, which could have suc
value in areas where a high rat
of illiteracy and little develo]
ment of radio facilities exist.
A general proposal was pi
forward that Unesco should co-
operate with governments to so
up regional film boards, whic
would provide a wider an
cheaper means for the produc-
tion, distribution and display (
educational films within eac
area. Proposals were made tha
the reciprocal exchange of film
should be undertaken, and in
order to make this poss'ble, de
tailed information and catalogue
of educational films would have
to be established.
It was further recommended
that Unesco should foster the dis
tribution of evaluated films by
asking nations to accept a con
vention facilitating exchanges by
every means, particularly the elim
ination of import duties.
It was suggested that in order
to use educational films to their
fullest extent, especially for pur-
poses of fundamental education
the us use of mobile un'ts should be
encouraged. Such units could
reach large audiences in outlying
districts, particularly in those
where no cinema nor electricity
exist at present.
An important series of recom-
mendations dealt with training
to provide a larger cadre of those
News Agencies
[Following is part of conclusions
of Technical Needs Commission
last August on question of news
agencies]
AUSTRIA, Hungary, Italy- e a c h has a national
agency dealing almost exclus-
ively, with collection of domes-
: ic news and through cor-
respondents and agreements
with other agencies provides
a foreign news Service.
In Central and South
America, position is reversed.
Only in Venezuela and Uru-
guay do small independent
agencies exist. In Peru an
agency exists, but serves only
one newspaper ; and is also
closely connected with a
foreign news agency. The
U. S. A. agencies are predomin-
ant in all the countries.
Only in Mexico is there some
competition from European
news services. The press of
Honduras, Cuba, Dominican
Republic and Ecuador is
almost entirely dependent
upon international agencies
for foreign news. In Haiti
there is no regular news ser-
vice.
In the Far Eastern coun-
tries, previously dominaed
by a British agency, there is
a tendency, with growing
independence, to set up na-
tional agencies.
Burma has already set up
an independent agency, and
same may shortly be true in
both India and Pakistan.
Radio transmitters, like one shown above need rebuilding in war-
devastated Europe.

who would produee and use edu-
cational films. Without such
training an increase in the num-
ber of films to less advanced
countries would be valueless. It
was urged that there should be
seminars for audio-visual educa-
tors in differnt regions in 1949,
so that the best use might be
made of educational films.
In addition, a recommendation
was made that Unesco should
approach governments and if
possible provide th means for
scholarships and travel so that
more technicians and students
should be able to study produc-
tion and developments in educa-
tional film work.
A first volume covering twelve
countries surveyed in 1947 was
published last year and proved
highly successful both for its
informational value and as a
guide to reconstruction activities.
A further recommendations pro
poses that Unesco should ask
each country with production fa-
ciiit'es to make a full length
film in 1949 destined for audien-
ces of children, and tetting one
of their own children's favourite
stories or nursery tales. These
films would be d'stributed all
over the world, and combine an
excellent theme for a basis of
international understanding at
an early age with a simple and
inexpensive method.

MASS SCHOOLING, TECHNICAL TRAINING
STRESSED BY RADIO EXPERTS'
IN 1948, unl'ke last year.Unesco's enquiry into techni-
cal needs in radio covered coun-
tries not directly hit by the war.
Because of this fact and be-
cause these surveys will oe
extended in the next years to
other regions of the world not
drectly affected by the war, the
Radio Sub-commission on Tech-
nical Needs, which met in Paris
last August to study the reports
of Unesco's field workers, form-
ulated conclusions and recom-
mendations aimed at eliminating
the most ou2standing general
problems of the radio industry.
Thus the commission did not
limit itself merely to a I'st of the
radio needs of the countries sur-
veyed but concentrated on such
problems as the use of radio m
schools, and in mass education
and the development of profes-
sional radio personnel.
This year's radio surveys
showed that the s'tuation in the
European war-hit countries IAus-
tria, Italy, Hungary) is substan-
tially the same as those consid-
ered in 1947 ; the posit on is par-
ticularly serious in the war-
devastated nat'ons of Asia (Bur-
ma, Federation of Malaya).
Except in Uruguay and Mexico,
the radio picture in countries
which did not suffer directly
from the war-whether in Asia
or in Central and South Amer'ca
- is not very satisfactory. Uru-
SURVEY SHOWS RADIO
Unesco's 1948 field surveys in radio
eovering. 3 European, 9 Latin American
and ã Asiatic countries showed that
the organization uf broadcasting in
these three regions and the equipment
available are very different. Their-
needs may be summed up brieUy as
follows :
RADIO ORGANIZATION
EUROPE.-In Austna and
Italy, broadcasting monopolies
have been granted to private
companies over v ; hich the State
exercises direct supervision. In
Hungary, radic is a State monop-
oly. All three countries broad-
cast advertising programmes. Re-
venue derived from this covers
only a part of expenses. Bulk of
radio budget in all 3 countries
comes from compulsory annual
licence fees receiving sets.
LATIN AMERICA.-Advertis-
ing permitted in all these coun-
tries makes up majority of finan-
cial resources of radio organiza-
tions. The considerable time taken
up by advertising inevitably re-
duces that devoted to cultural
programme.
In Haiti and Honduras there
are only private stations.
In Ecuador, State has part-time
use of"La Voz de los Andes"
(privately owned missionary sta-
tion). In Cuba and Venezuel the
official broadcasting organization
has only low-powered equipment.
Peruvian State network is rather
more important. In Mexico, the
Government and University of
Mexico. own 8 transmitters be-}
tween them, but power of the
official network is considerably
lower than that of a single one
of major private stations.
Only Uruguay has a powerful
and well-equiped official broad-
casting system.
SOUTH EAST ASIA.-Ail
broadcasting stations belong to
government. No advertising ac-
cepted. Annual license fee for
receiving sets.
In Burma, Federation of Ma-
laya, India and Pakistan the
respective governments have
available a radio network which
already enables them to make
educational and cultural broad-
casts, particularly necessary in
countries where illiteracy rate is
high. The position wil ! be still
further improved in the future,
when their schemes of expansion
have materialized. Government
broadcasts are also designed for
the information of rural popu-
lace. but latter own only a small
number of receiving sets.
DEFICIENCIES
RECEIVING SETS
See chart on right
EUROPE.-. Austria is one of
best equipped countries in Europe"
as regards receiving sets and has
one set per seven inhabitants
(this is the same as for France
and Noway). Hungary is less
well equipped : one set per 20 in-
habitants. Local industry cannot
meet country's needs, which is
the more regrettable as author-
ities are making a considerable
effort in school broadcasting.
Italy has one receiving set per 23
inhabitants.
LATIN AMERICA.-Propor-
tion of receivers each country
is related to magnitude of their
transmitting equipment. Thus
Uruguay and Cuba hare one re-
ceiver per 7 inhabitants, Venue-
zuela one per 28, M ? xico one set
per 32 inhabitants. Honduras one
per 61, Peru one set per 65. Ecua-
dor one per 111, Dominican Re-
public one per 164. and Haiti once
per 1, 000.
Except for Uruguay, where
there is a small local output of
receivers, quite inadequate for
the county's needs, there is no
radio industry capable of manu-
facturing sets in any of the coun-
tries surveyed. However, Mexico
is considering establishment of
such an industry.
SOUTHEAST ASIA. - In
Burma, there is one receiving
set per 3, 400 inhabitant ; in In-
dic one per 1, 490 ; Federation of
Malaya one per 207 ; Pakistan
one per 920.
With the exception of India,
where output is still low none of
these countries manufactures re-
ceiving sets and it may be said
that for the general population
in all these countries radio
remains a luxury. as the selling
price of sets is far beyond their
reach.
TRANSMITTERS
AND EQUIPMENT
EUROPE.-The most power-
ful Austrian transmitter was des-
troyed in 1945, but country hopes
to have its pre-war network
structed by next July. Austrian
radio industry comparatively
developed and lacks foreign ex-
change for necessary purchases
abroad.
Eighty percent of Hungarian
equipment was destroyed, but a
great effort has been made and
country has already re-formed
its pre-war network. By end of
1949. Italy will have reconstructed
its 1940 network and proposes to
improve it thereafter to cover
whole of its territory satisfactorily.
Italy has a considerable radio
industry, but the high cost price
makes export impossible.
LATIN AMERICA.-Both pri-
vate and official stations.
generally speaking, are inade-
quatelyequipped to meet needs of
their counties, as their popula-
tions are aften widely dispersed.
Transmitting licenses granted in
response to local needs have not
been issued according to any
coherent plan.
Honduras and especially Haiti
are the two countries where this
lack is most readily perceptible.
Uruguay is only one of nine
countries surveyed by Unesco this
year where there are manufac-
turing possibilities permitting
further improvements in an
already satisfactory network.
. SOUTHEAST ASIA.-Require-
ments in broadcasting equip-
ment in this part of world are
enormous, particularly in case of
Pakistan and Burma. Even India,
which owns a network of an
overall power of 350 kilowatts,
which it is developing according
to a very well thought out plan,
has in fact only one kilowatt per
million inhabitants,. whereas
Mexico, for instance, has 50
kilowatts per million inhabitants.
An even more striking comparison
perhaps is that India has only
one kilowatt power approximately
per 10. 000 square kilometres
whereas Mexico has six kilowatts
for the sam area.
None of the countries surveyed
manufactures transmitters or
spare parts. Principal difficulty
in purchasihg needed equipment
in the U. S. A. is lack of dollars.
guay and Mexico, however, have
satisfactory equipment and high-
grade staff and might provide
useful professional training cen-
tres for the staff of broadcasting
organizations in certain Latin
American countries-
Both in Asia and America, the
experts had to consider one
problem of exceptional seriousness
- the problem of illiteracy-which
in some cases concerns 85 % of
the population.
Education by Radio
For this reon, the radio com-
mission considered the use of
school broadcasting and mass
FILM & RADIO
education by radio of vital
importance for all countries and
especially so for those with large
ittiterate populations.
It urged Unesco to request
governments as well as national
and : nternational organizations
to step up radio education by
devoting a fixed portion of their
usual broadcasting time to school
broadcasts.
It specifically requested that a
maximum number of schools be
equipped with rece'ving sets and
that at least one receiving set
be provided for community listen-
ing in each village where illit-
eracy is high. Th use of mobile
radio equipments, providing tem-
porary service ; was also urged
along with mobile cinema pro-
grammes, as an effective means
of mass education.
The radio experts also sug-
gested that the Radio Division of
Unesco shculd co-operate in an
over-all joint study of the means
of combating ill : teracy by the
use of radio.
Professional Training
Turning to the problem of pro-
fessional radio training in the
countries surveyed this year, the
sub-commission concluded that
"the quest'on of professional
training is even more acute than
in 1947".
"In the great majority of the
countries covered by the 1948
survey", it said."there are no
establishments specializing in the
professional training of news and
programme personnel. In addition
many countries are suffering
from a shortage of specialized
staff, alike on the technical and
on the programme and news
side".,
Considering the composite pic-
ture presented by the two Unesco
surveys of 1947 and 1948, the
radio commission emphatically
confirmed last year's recommen-
dations for the training of tech-
nical personnel and rad 0 journ-
alists by the use of finishing
instructional courses and the
training of programme personnel
by instructors brought in from
other countries as well as the or-
ganization of practical courses
and professional training centres.
In addition, the commission
this year urged the creation of
special courses on broadcasting
techniqus and the inclusion of
radio courses 1n the curr'cula of
existing schools.
These courses would include
work on news broadcasts, in
schools of journalism ; producing
and broadcasting of radio plays.
in Conservatories ; the art of
broadcasting, in secondary schools
and universities ; and"broadcast-
ing as a social factor", in schools
of political and social science".
Publications Urged
In order to facilitate the organ-
ization and development of edu-
cational broadcasting, and publi-
cize the need for professional
training, the Radio comm'ssion
suggested that Unesco undertake
the publication of two books :
1) A WORK ON SCHOOL
BROADCASTING AND EDUCA-
TIONAL BROADCASTING, IN-
TENDED CHIEFLY FOR THE
USE OF GOVERNMENTS AND
BROADCASTING ORGANIZA-
TIONS.
2) A WORK ON THE PROBL-
EMS OF PROFESSIONAL
TRAINING FOR RADIO PER-
SONNEL.
The commission also recom-
mended that Unesco sponsor the
publication of technical, histori-
cal and sociological by Unesco
broadcasting.
Radio Summer University
The radio experts also called
for the orfanization by Unesco
each year, on a regional basis,
of Unesco summer universities
for the study of broadcast art and
information. The summer univer-
s'ty would be open primarily to
news and programme staff of
broadcasting organizations.

6 UNESCO COURIER Vol. l.-No..
Forty Agreements Signed
With Non-Governemental Bodies
FROM the very begnning jfits existence Unesco has been
aware of the essential part which
the voluntary international bodies
working in the fields of educa-
tion, science and culture can play
in carrying out its aims.
Format agreements between
Unesco and two international
voluntary organizations, the World
Federation of United Nations
Association (WFUNA) and the
International Council of Mu-
seums (ICOM) have been recent-
ly signed in Paris.
On 7 and 8 October an Interim
Committee representing some 70
international non-governmental
organizations having consultative
status with the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will
meet at Unesco House to study
the ways by which these volun-
tary international bodies can best
contribute to the. work pf the
United Nations and their Spe-
cialized Agencies.
The Executive Board's Com-
mittee on Relationships with
Non-Governmental Organizations
meets on 11 October to review the
present co-operative arrangements
of Unesco witn voluntary organ-
izations and to consider how their
resources could be, in the future,
most fully employed for Unesco's
objectives.
In more than one instance in
the past Unesco has been in the
fortunate position of being able
to benefit from an existing inter-
national network built up by long
years of voluntary efforts. This is
the case of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (1C
SUI, the chief non-governmental
body in the field of Natural
Sciences, established in 1919. By a
formal agreement with ICSU in
December 1946, ICSU became one
of Unesco's chief instruments of
scientific co-operation and ex-
change on a world scale.
. Through an agreement with the
Internaticnal Studies Conference,
in force since June 1947, the De-
partment of. social Sciences bene-
fits by the contacts in many coun-
tries of this international organ-
ization.
However, the bulk of non-gov-
ernmental organizations co-oper-
ate with Unesco under"consulta-
tive arrangements'. These arran-
gements include certain basic
privileges granted by Unesco to
the international voluntary bodies
satisfying certain criteria as to
the aims, structure, international
character and represlntativeness
of the organizations concerned.
Facilities offered by Unesco to
organizations approved for con-
sultative arrangements include in
particular : invitation to the Gen-
eral Conference and to other'
meetings convened by Unesco ; re-
ceiving of relevant documents
and publications ; a right to sub-
mit written statements concern-
ing matters of common interest.
At present. 69 international
non-governmental bodies have
been approved for this type of
arrangement. They include youth,
women's and relief organizations,
professional oodies of teachers,
lawyers and artists, and special-
ized scientific societies.
A considerable number of the
organizations enjoying"consulta-
tive arrangements"contributed
during the present year towards
the execution of Unesco's Pro-
World Political Science
Association Planned
The first international con-
ference of political scientists
called by Unesco took place in
Paris from September 13 to 16.
The conference agreed on the
establishment of an International
Political Science Association, and
. ! Preparatory Committee was set
up to draft the constitution of the
Asociation Late in 1949 or early
in 1950. it is hoped to hold a re-
presentative meeting of national
political science groups and other
interested bodies in order to de-
termine the structure, functions
and activities of the International
Political Science Association.

request of Unesco and against

basis, surveys, investigations, bib-
liographies or various stud es.

ful co-operation-which is so far

the Mexico City General Confer-
ence. As a result, 40 contracts of
this nature have been concluded,
for a total amount of more than
$100, 000, enablinl U esco to use
the experience and eompetence of
international non-governmental
bodies for a common purpose,
In several instances, Unesco has
requested these organizations to
hold international congresses with
a programme mutually agreed
upon, thus taking advantage of
the facilities which well establish-
ed international bodies have in
certain fields.
There is a third type of co-oper-
ative arrangement provided in
Unesco's policy towards interna-
tional non-governmental organ-
izations."Advisory Committees"
aim at grouping non-goverc-nent-
al organizations having similar
objectives or working in the same
field, such as TICER, grouping 28
independent international organ-
izations working in the field of
Educational Reconstruction. A se-
cond Advisory Committee group-
ing major international Univers-
ity Organizations is on the point
of being constituted.
The chapter of Unesco's co-
operation with non-governmental
organizations is at its very begin-
ning. The framework provided by
the Constitution and the direc-
tives adopted by the Mexico City
Conference, offer, however, a solid
basis for associating with Unes-
co's venture invaluable resources
of competence, experience and
goodwill accumulated in numer-
ous non-governmental organiza-
tions. Unesco'is well aware that
these organizations, representing
the actual"producers'and"con-
sumers"of education, science and
culture constitute an element
which is essential for the success
of the-Organization.
Latin American Science Coordination
(Continued from Page 1)
An opin'on which is to-day
widely held throughout the scien-
tific world, even outside Latin
America, is that on the day Latin
American scientists and techn-
cians pool their knowledge, a
fresh era of progress will begin
for that Quarter of the world.
Some thirty scientists from
eleven South American countries
outlined such a programme for
co-ordination in the five days of
the conference.
"I shall give only one example
of the importance of the problem

Office in Montevideo.
we have to solve which is of
practical and scientific interest."
said Dr. Eduardo Cruz Coke, Pro-
fessor of Physiological Chemistry
at the University of Santiago.
Chile, who was specially invited
to attend the conference convened
by Unesco and the Government
of Uruguay.
"In South America, on which
the world is becoming increasingly
dependent for its  food supplies we
we see vast stretches of parable
land being irreparably impoverish-
ed by erosion and lack of proper
care. It is the result of inadequate
knowledge of the nature of tie
land in America ; we can acqui1'e
such knowledge only if we are able
to co-ordinate our experiments and
supplement research carried out
in one of our countries by the
results obtained in others."
As early as 1946, Unesco pro-
posed that,. as a general solution
to the problem of scientific co-
ordination, a Field Science Co-
operation Office should be esta-
blished in LaCn America. Such
an Office was set up in Rio de
Janeiro the following year.
The South American experts
bought together by Unesco on
September 6 (under the honorary
chairmanship of Professor Ber-
nardo Houssay, eminent Argenti-
nian scientist and 1943 Nobel Prize
winner) approved Unesco's project
for extending the activities of the
Oficina Cientifica de Cooperacion
en America Latin. and advised
Unesco on the best ways the Of-
fice would aid sc : entists in Latin
America. The recommendations
on this subject transmitted to
Unesco, constitute one of the most
remarkable programme for scien-
tific co-ordination in South Amer-
ica so far proposed.
One cf the tasks which the ex-
perts would like Unesco to un-
dertake, with th support of the
governments concerned, is the or-
ganization of two SYMPOSIA,
one devoted to"the study of phy-
siological conditions iø high alti-
tudes" and the other (in co-ope-
ration with FAO) to"Physics,
Chemistry and Biology of Latin
American Soi)."
These two subjects for study
and discussion, which Unesco is
asked to suggest to meetings of
scientists convened by the Office
in Montevideo, are not only of
undoubted sc'entific interest but
also of considerable social im-
portance. Many South Americans
live in the mountains or on very
high plateaux. A problem of
adaptation thus arises-for the
indigenous population no less
than for the descendants of Euro-
peans-with numerous soc'al re-
percussion which demand tho-
rough consideration.
It was also decided that, in the
initial period, the main task of
the Montevideo Office should be
in the field of bibliography-to
organize a bibliographic inform-
ation service, distribute micro-
films, publish a South American
scientific year-book, etc.
The final recommendations of
the Montevideo Conference cover
no less than 15 pages of type-
script. In : hem, Unesco and the
Governments of South America
are asked to develop to the maxi-
mum exchanges of students and
teachers between the various
countries of Latin America and
between those countries and the
other great cultural centres of
the world. The experts also
stressed the need for increasing
the number of scientists and
technicians in Latin America and
recommended the establishment
of"National Funds for scientific
research in South America."

In view of this proposal,
advantage will be taken of the
Fontainebleau meeting to set up
a Regional Study Group (Com-
mission) for Europe and Africa
by means of a Technical Sympo-
sium to crystallize views on a
number of top'cs which will
come before the projected Inter-
national Technical Conference or
1949. It is hoped too that the
agenda for this Technical Con-
ference will be drafted at Fon-
tainebleau.
Nevertheless, the main object
of the Conference is to draft and
adopt the final constitution of
the Provisional International
Union for the Protection of
Nature.
In a paper written specially in
preparation for the Fontaine-
bleau Conference, and issued last
month by the Unesco Secretariat
for the French Government,
Dr. Harold J. Coolidge Jr., of the
National Research Council, Wash-
ington, D. C., writes :
"Unesco's function has
been defined as that of
'mobilizing ; the forces of
education, science and cul-
ture for the ultimate estab-
lishment of a free and
peaceful world-community'.
Such a community will de-
pend on the health and
vitaly of the individual
who compose it. Such a goat
can best be achieved not
only by the prevention of
disease, but also through
education and scientific
research directed at creat-
ing a fuller understanding
of the vital relation ships
between soil and water and
plant and animal life. In
other words, making man-
kind aware of the relation-
ship of living things with
each other and with their
environment, or the science
of ecology" (1).

Lastly a permanent intr-
governmental Committee of
twelve Members has been appoint-
ed to assist th Berne Office in
its task of informing Members
: nd making preparat'ons for
future revising conferences.
As can be seen, important de
cisions were taken, and thern
will be notable changes in the
contractual relations of the Mem-
ber States of the Union when th
instruments of ratification have
been deposited with the Swiss
Federal Government.
Although no account can be
given of the unofficial contacts
and the instructive exchange of
views which took place between
delegations and observers, it can
be said that they were lively and
important and undoubtedly con-
tain the germ of satisfactory fu-
tur action towards a unii'ed
system of protedion of literary,
artistic and scientific property
throughout the world.

material on this subject are requested
to write to the Unesco Department of
Natural Sciences for documents in the

For Humanities
World Council
The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organiza-
tion is to make a grant of $7,500
to help the Preparatory Commis-
sion for the International Council
for Philosophy and Humanistic
Studies in the early stages of its
work.
The grant, Dr. Julian Huxley,
Unesco's Director-General, ex-
plained, was being made in ac-
cordance with the usual practice
of Unesco of supporting a promis-
ing infant.
Delegates from five interna-
tional, non-governmental bodies
met in September at Unesco
House, Paris, to approve a pro-
visional Constitution and set up
a Preparatory Commission for the
Council.
Members of the Preparatory
Commission hope to be able to
call the first session of the Gen-
eral Assembly of the Council in
January 1949 in Brussels. They
expect that. through the different
International organizations which
will take part in the Council a
significant step forward will be
made in intellectual cooperation
throughout the world. The Coun-
cil will facilitate in many ways
the growth of contacts between
scholars of different counties
and will provide, for Unesco, a
working counterpart in the field
of philosophy, humanistic and re-
lated studies, to the International
Council of Scientific Unions.

tudes of youth concerning other
nations, peace and war.
Understandings and attitudes
formed in childhood persist into
adulthood, and the opin'ons and
attitudes of most literate adults
have been conditioned by the
textbooks and teaching materials
they studied in school.
This fact was recognized by the
First Session of the General Con-
ference of Unesco when it approv-
ed a nine point programme for
the improvement of textbooks and
teaching materials as aids in
developing international under-
standing. This programme was
continued by the Second Session
of the General Conference meet-
ing in Mex'co City in 1947, and
the Secretariat of Unesco is in the
process of putting in into effect.
Enquzry Sent To Member I
States
The first step in the improve-
ment of textbooks and teaching
materials as aids to peace is to
discover what has already been
done and what is being done to
achieve this end. Consequentiy
the Secretariat has been assemb-
ling and studying the materials
on textbook improvement pro-
duced in var'ous parts of the
world.
An enquiry has been sent to
Member States to discover what is
being done at the present time
and what is planned for the fu-
ture. In addition to informational
material, lists are be'ng prepared
of individuals and groups int'r
ested in the improvement of
textbooks and teaching materials.
These resources will enable Unesco
to serve as a clearing house in
th's veld.
Another aspect of Unesco's pro-
gramme is the preparation of
principles and criteria and a
model plan for the analysis and
improvement of textbooks and
teaching materials. The model
plan, including the principles and
criteria, is now in draft form and
will be submitted to Member
States in the near future. It will
be accompanied by a recommenda-
tion that Member States study
the treatment of agenc'es of I
international co-operation in their
own textbooks. At a later time
these reports will be studied at
Unesco House and a summary
report will be prepared.
Handbook Planned
On Improved Textbooks
The Unesco Secretariat is also
seeking to extend bilateral and
regnal agreements and enter-
prises. Information On such
agreements and enterprises is
being assembled and studied and
recommendations for future ac-
tion will be made on the basis of
past experience.
The Secretariat plans to bring
together its findings and recom-

standing and peace. Its ami
is to report on what has
been and is being done, to ma6e
recommendations, to provide
limited assistance on request,
and, above all, to provide an
opportunity for those interested
in the improvement of textbooks
and teaching materials in various
parts of the world to work to-
gether in a common cause.
Truth and justice in the content
of textbooks and teaching ma-
terials will contribute to a more
whoiesome and effective local and
national citizenship as well as to
the development of the under-
standings, attitudes, and skilh
necessary to world citizenship and
to peace.
NewZealand
Offers
Fellowships
The New Zealand Govern-
ment has set aside a sum of
£15.000 to finance a fellowship
scheme to provide study op-
portunities in New Zealand for
an initial group of five Far
Eastern stud ? nts.
The first grants being made
available include two in China
and one each to the Philip-
pines, Malay and Burma.
In approving the scheme,
the New Zealand Minister ('f
Education declared that the
needs of these Far Eastern
countries "for the kinds of
training and experience avai-
lable in New Zealand are more
urgent than those at the war-
devastated countries of Eu-
rope". It was pointed out,
however, that the programme
will be extended to other
Eastern countrie.  and event-
ually to European nation.
The governments of the
countries to which the fellow
ships are being offered are
being informed about the facil-
ities which New Zealand can
offer. Final selection of the
candidates will be made by the
Fellowships Committee set up
by the New Zealand National
Commission for Unesco.
Fields of study suggested for
the first five candidates in-
clude : agriculture, rural life
and education, Maori educa-
tion, education in the Island
Territories, social services,
miming, engineering, teactler
training and the technical as-
pects ot broadcasting.
At the conclusion of the fel-
lowship, each student will be
expected to return to his home
country to put his training
and experience to use in re-
construction work. The grants
lcill be generally of six months'
duration and will allow for
£ 450 including travel ex-
penses within New Zealand.

The late Ruth Benedict
When Unesco drew up its programme of
 work it stressed the need for"an enquIry
into the distinctive character of the various
national cultures and ideals, with the a : m of
stlmulating the sympathy and respect of nations
for each other's ideals and aspiration and the
appreciation of national-problems. One focus of
such an enquiry would be the study 0 : ways
by which the young are trained to become res-
ponsible participants in the national culture".
Unesco has in this statement of policy stated
its belief that recognition of cultural differences
among civilized nations can promote internation-
al co-operation. Usually in most nations, the
attitude has been qllite different. Usually people
who hope for world co-operation art the very
ones who minimize fundamental
differences among the nations ;
they emphasize the similarity
of human virtues and motives.
no matter what the differences
in cultural practice and behav-
iour.
Those who oppose interna-
tional co-operation, on the other
hand, Name the chaos of the
w c world on the presence of
these differences between
one nation and another
They stress that other nations
must accept the virtues and
practices with which they are
familiar in their own culture
before it will be possible to
make a peaceful world. This is
an attitude which is centuries
old. It has not made for world
peace.
Now Unesco proposes that
social scien : ists should take the
lead in promoting a new and
different attitude, studying na-
tional differences even down
into such fundamental things
as the way we bring up our
children.
Unesco is saying, in effect.
that it is part of wisdom to
recognize that human commun-
ities are not all alike, and is------.,
suggesting that we cultivate psycholog ; callv heal-
thy attitudes also among the nations and that by
greater study and understanding of national diff-
erences we could promote a more co-operative
world.
No Nation Can Live To Itself Alone
This programme of Unesco's  is especially neces-
sary in the world today. No nation any longer
lives by itself alone. In the modern world it is
absolutely  necessary that each nation take some
attitude about other modes of life than its own.
Any study of national differences is a study
of comparative cultures. This is the special field
of social anthropology, and it is necessary to
stress a few of the principal conclusions which
have been derived from such study.
The way of life among people, the virtues
they exhibit and the aggressiveness they show is
learned in their experience in that social order ;
it is not racial ; it is not instinctive in the sense
that human beings everywhere are born with a
set of instincts which account for their aggres-
sions and their cruelties.
The cultural patterns which men in all societies
invent for themselves and transmit down the
generations have in eact1 community a consider-
able degree of consistency w : thin them-
selves. These pattern of learned behaviour have
to be taught anew to each generation. No matter
how distinctively French France seems over
several centuries, or how Dutch Holland seems.
with each ne. generation the personnel of
France and Holland changes completely. One
generation dies and another is born. In the way
in which parents handle their babies, in the
way in which older children treat younger
children, in the way in which teachers reward
and punish their pupils, emotions are selected
and cultivated in them whict1 fit them to be
members of their own commuaity and nation.
Cultural study of national differences is just
beginning to be accepted. The members of this
seminar have therefore an opnortunity to con-
tribute to the research which is necessary, and
it is wcll to say a few words about methods of
training for such work.
Comparative study of human culture was not
possible before the development of certain eli-
mates of opinion, and no student of the subject
can do excellent work who finds this climate of
opinion personally distasteful.
Students of comparative cultures have usually
been trained by acquainting them with a wide
range of the diversities of possible social insti-
tutions which are traditional in various parts
of the world and then sending them to faIrly
small simple communities very different from
their own. These are often pre-
literate tribes.
Because the social arrange-
ments and motivations of
these communities are entirely
unfamiliar to the student, he
has to observe and record every
detail of their lives in order
to understand them. The"cult-
ural surprise"he experiences
gives him an education in patt-
erns of culture which it is hard
to give in any other way.
Genetic Study
of National Character
This Unesco seminar is de-
voted to the study of childhood
education, and Dr. Chen's study
group has as its subject"Child-
hood Education in Different
Nations". In line wi : h Unesco's
programme, seminar members
are interpreting their assign-
ment. not merely as the child's
school education, but as his
home and community exper-
iences as well,"the ways in
which the young are trained to
become responsible participants
in their national culture".
It is hoped that some of the
delegates to this seminar will----Çl-------
be stimulated by the discussions here, to go back
to their countries to record observations and in-
terviews, and thus contribute to mutual knowledge
among nations of the world.
Genetic study of different cultures is precisely
the study of how each generation is conditioned
"to become responsible participants", in the way
of life which is traditional in the community
into which it is born. The technical development
of such study is possible today because of
knowledge that has been acquired in several
sister sciences, all of which are mvolved in such
genetic studies : (a) the study of the physical
maturation of the child ; (by medical studies i : 1
the field of psychosomatics ; (c) psychiatry.
Training The Young
As Responsible Participants
In National Cultures
Aided by the development of these related
sciences, the time is ripe for the study of the
"ways in which the young are trained to become
responsible participants in national cultures". It
is only necessary to collect the observations and
record the attitudes upon which understanding
can be based.
Thus. when all European nations have made
systematic records of observations of child life
and have gathered data from pare : its and from
educators can adequate understanding be
obtained of the ways in which children in differ-
ent areas of Europe are fitted"to become res-
ponsible participants"in national life.
If we are to accept the different ideals and
alternative social arrangements of the nations of
the world, those of us who are professionally
concerned with childhood educatioa have a task
which extends far beyond problems of curricu-
lum revision. We need the clear-sightedness and
the tolerance which will help us to appreciate
the different kinds of strengths which different
nations could contribute to the world in which
we desire to live.

8 UNESCO COURIER Vol. I.-No 9.
AN EDUCATIONAL WEAPON :
The Museums
"ONE IN THE EYE!"
Exhibits''Bring Home
Unesco Message
"
THE stimulating and sugges-tive article by Mr. H. E. Wil-
liams, concerning the Unesco ex-
hibit ncw in the main hall of
Unesco House. Paris, emphasizes
not only the value of such exhi-
bits to the public generally, but
also the educational value to
those who may participate in
their preparation.
There remains however one
further question, which Mr. Wil-
liams does not discuss in his
article, and that is the means by
which such exhibits can most
effectively and most efficiently
be presented to a wide public.
The value of such educational
exhibits depends not only upon
their attractiveness and the edu-
cational message which they
present visually, but equally
upon their presentation in such
a place and in such a manner
to make their appeal to the
widest public possible.
Museums, organized as they
are as popular educational ins-
titutions, designed to reaoh
through their exhibits and edu-
cational programme masses of
people both young and old, are
amongst the most effective me-
dia for communicating educa-
tional information.
I doubt whether it is generally
appreciated that there are very
few population centres through-
out the world, where museums
are playing an active part in
educational life, in which the
combined annual attendance at
the museums does not exceed
the population of the city in
. which they are located.

CHAUNCEY J. HAMLIN
President, International Coun-
cil of Museums.
RECENT visitors to UnescoHouse have expressed keen
admiration for the Exhibi-
tion now installed in the spacious
Main Hall. Through a series of
large illustrated panels, and a few
Bymbolic modes, it outlines the
motives which animate Unesco,
reveals its relationship to UN and
the Specialized Agencies, and
activities in Unesco's programme.
Even its best friends often find
it difficult to describe, in plain
language, Unesco's role and pro-
cedures, and this Exhibition prov-
es once more that well-conceived

charts, diagrams. and photo-
graphs, assembled in a coherent
and progressive pattern, can illu-
minate a theme which is resistant
to verbal clarification.
Whenever I see an Exhibition
which, like this one tells a story
so graphically, I call to mind the
exhortation dinned into me, as a
hoy, by my boxing-instructor."Al-
ways remember", he used to say,
"that one in the eye is worth
three on the ear !"
Many visitors from Member
States, admiring the lay-out, and
(even more) the beautiful colour-
effects of this display, have de-
dared that replicas of it, sent on
tour among the nations, could do
much to familiarize people with
the work of Unesco. That, no
doubt,  is true, but I hope myself
that this attractive visualization
will not become a mere stereotype
of its kind.
What we want is not a stan-
dard Unesco Exhibition but an
assortment or such displays, each
one expresszng afresh the basic
aims and methods of the organiza-
tion. Unesco is always, and right-
ly endeavouring to scotch the de-
lusion that it is a universal pro-
vider, and constantly reminding
the world that its purpose is to
stimulate appropriate activities
and attitudes in the Member
States.

permanently installed in Unesco
House. then, will achieve a ma-

our strategy-with the winners

World's Fair of Culture which is
being mooted in Unesco nowadays.
Exhibitions of this highly-skilled
professional kind have an evident
publicity value, but I should like
to see them supplemented, in
every school, community centre
and similar strategic spot, by a
totally different kind of display
- by unpretentious, amateur,
home-made jobs, planned, and
put together as a group activity.
There is no morè effective me-
thod of"bringing home"Unesco

ance, the exercise of building a
Unesco exhibition for themselves.
partly by making their own maps,
charts and diagrams and partly
by ransacking albums, family
archives, books and periodicals for
illustrative material. The results
of these adventures in initiative
can be very good to look at but.
apart from their success as a
finished product, they represent
a process of the highest educa-
tive value.
As a G. H. Q. job the Exhibition
at Unesco House is appropriate
to its setting aid a most attrac-
tive show-piece. But the most
dynamic kind of visual aid is the
kind which communities invent
for themselves.

Further, most museums, accus-
tomed as they are to presenting
exhibitions have, through their
experience, competence to at-
tract large numbers of visitors.
The International Council of
Museums was organized to pro-
vide a suitable organization to
further international co-opera-
tion among museums, and to be
the co-ordinating and represen-
tative international body fur-
thering museums interests.
The museums of the world, as
custodians of much of the cul-
tural heritage of mankind, and
as dynamic educational institu-
tions, stand ready through this
Council to place their resources
and professional talent at the
disposal of Unesco in helping to
further Unesco's fundamental
objectives of promoting interna-
tional understanding and co-
operation.
In this connection this Council
has already taken action through
the adoption of Resolutions,

fato. New York, U. S. A., is President
of The International Council of
Museums. Mr. Hamlin has recently
retired from the presidenoy of the

offering its co-operation in the
preparation and circulation of
such exhibits.
To this end we shall indeed be
happy to collaborate in any way
that Unesco may desire, and we
take this opportunity of congra-
tulating Unesco upon the very
fine exhibit now appearing in
Unesco House. We hope that
ways and means can be found
whereby the same, or replicas, or
similar exhibits, can be circulat-
ed to museums throughout the
world, utilizing, as far as pos-
sible, the facilities of these
museums through the medium
of this organization.
