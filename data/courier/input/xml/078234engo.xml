The young king of Crete
In this 3,500 years-old fresco, the noble figure of a Cretan priest-king, wearing
a crown of flowers with an aigrette of peacock feathers, his slender waist
enclosed by a kind of collar-ring, walks across a field of lilies, sacred flower of
the ancient Minoan civilization. The work was recovered from the ruins of
Knossos, which seems to have been engulfed by some cataclysmic event, possibly
an earthquake, about 1400 B.C. Painted floors and walls were universal in
Minoan houses, and 3,000 years before the Christian era Cretan artists painted
remarkable frescoes on wet lime, depicting human figures, animals and flowers.

When the founding fathers of the United
Nations drew up the U.N.'s Charter at
San Francisco in 1945, they established
in the very first paragraph of the Pream¬
ble their fundamental objective: to save
succeeding generations from the scour¬
ge of war. In the next paragraph of
the Preamble they reaffirmed faith in
fundamental human rights and in the
dignity and worth of the human person.
It was in recognition of this interdepen¬
dence of human rights and world peace
that the United Nations took upon itself,
as one of its earliest tasks, the formu¬
lation of mankind's first Universal De¬
claration of Human Rights as a common
standard of achievement for all peoples
and for all nations, large and small.

The author of the first draft
of the Universal Declaration recalls
HOW THE CHARTER
ON HUMAN RIGHTS
WAS BORN
Twenty years ago on December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly
adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To mark this
event the U.N. General Assembly has unanimously designated the whole of this year,
1968, as International Human Rights Year.
In this issue, the Unesco Courier reviews the events which led to the final prepa¬
ration of the Universal Declaration and examines some of the significant devel¬
opments in the field of human rights during the past twenty years which have
made it "a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations". Much
has been accomplished since 1948, but no country in the world has yet fully imple¬
mented the rights affirmed in the Universal Declaration.
In the article below, Professor René Cassin, former president of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights, who prepared the first draft of the Universal Declara¬
tion, recalls how the historic document was drawn up and reaffirms the profound
significance of the Declaration today.
by René Cassin
HEN, in the name of racism
and bigotry, Adolph Hitler launched
his remorseless juggernaut against
the rights of man in Germany and other
countries, and against the principles of
Liberty, Equality and Fraternity pro¬
claimed in 1789, many were the voices
raised in angry protest.
When his acts of aggression plunged
the world into a new global war, still
more numerous were those who saw
the conflict as "a crusade for funda¬
mental rights and freedoms" and
vowed that, even before the war was
ended, the respect and protection of
human rights should be inscribed
alongside Peace itself amongst the
fundamental aims of the new world
organization already foreseen, thereby
eliminating the weaknesses of the
4
RENE CASSIN is one of the great names in
the modern struggle for human rights. He
drew up the first draft of the Universal
Declaration. French representative to the
League of Nations (1924-1938) and to the
United Nations (1946-1958), he took part in
the preparatory meeting in 1944 which led
to Unesco's foundation. Former president of
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, he is
now president of the European Court of
Human Rights (Strasbourg) Among his many
works is "La Déclaration Universelle et la
Mise en des Droits de l'Homme"
(The Universal Declaration and the Achieve¬
ment of Human Rights). He is a member of
the Institut Français and president of the
Académie des Sciences Morales et Poli¬
tiques, Paris.
Covenant of the former League of
Nations.
The San Francisco Conference,
convened in the spring of 1945 to
draft the United Nations Charter,
unanimously endorsed this view.
The discovery of Hitler's extermin¬
ation camps at that time aroused such
horror that governments were com¬
pelled, by the weight of public opinion,
not only to bring to trial and punish
those guilty of war crimes and crimes
against humanity, but to solemnly
pledge to draft an International Bill of
Rights. With this in mind, a special
organ of the U.N. the Commission on
Human Rights was established in
1946 as laid down in Article 68 of the
U.N. Charter. Charged with the task
of promoting human rights generally,
the Commission was asked, on a
priority basis, to prepare a draft
Charter of Human Rights for sub¬
mission to the U.N. General Assembly.
This was the atmosphere in which,
in 1946, a special Division of Human
Rights was set up under Henri Laugier,
Assistant Secretary-General of the
United Nations, and in which the views
and recommendations of various civic
and other non-governmental organiz¬
ations were first heard by a preparatory
group. They met under the chairman¬
ship of Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, widow
of the deceased American President,
and agreed to undertake the simul
taneous drafting of two documents
an International Declaration of the Prin¬
ciples of Human Rights, inspired by
famous precedents from many
countries; and an International
Covenant which would define human
rights in precise, concrete terms and
be legally binding.
An eight-member drafting committee
then called on me to prepare a pre¬
liminary draft Declaration, on the basis
of material assembled by Professors
John P. Humphrey and Emile Giraud,
and proposals submitted by certain
governments (Panama and Cuba). This
draft was presented to the Committee
on June 3, 1947.
The discussions at this stage made
good progress, especially in regard
to the fundamental rights and freedoms
of the individual, already incorporated
in the famous English, American and
French declarations, and later enshrin¬
ed in almost every national consti¬
tution drawn up during the 19th and
20th centuries.
It was at the second session of the
Human Rights Commission, held in
Geneva in November 1947, that the
definite decision was taken to draw up
the future Charter on Human Rights
in three sections : a central Declar¬
ation, a legally binding Covenant, and
Measures of Implementation, that is,
arrangements for international review
of the way in which States carried out

their obligations under the Covenant.
The most rapid progress, however,
was made on the Declaration itself,
and special attention was given, at the
suggestion of the Soviet delegate,
Ambassador Alexander Bogomolov, to
those Articles dealing with economic,
social and cultural rights, since these
had been accorded particular attention
in the new constitutions drawn up
during the first half of our century.
The third session of the Human
Rights Commission, in the spring
of 1948, was the really decisive
one. It was then that the Preamble
and the final Articles of the draft
Declaration were adopted, due account
being taken of the views of the U.N.
Commission on the Status of Women,
and most important of all, that the
Commission decided to give equal
emphasis to two sets of rights : civil
and political rights (often known as
"rights of option") on the one hand,
and economic, social and cultural
rights (or "rights of claim") on the
other. It further specified in a cover¬
ing Article (Article 22) that the realiz¬
ation of the economic, social and
cultural rights was dependent on the
organization and resources of each
State as well as on international co¬
operation.
Once the draft Declaration had been
prepared, it was up to the Economic
and Social Council (ECOSOC) to
decide whether it should be submitted
to the General Assembly at once, or
held up pending completion of the
draft Covenant, an initiative of the
United Kingdom. Lord Attlee, then
Prime Minister of Great Britain, rallied
to the majority view, realizing that if
advantage were not taken of the then
favourable international atmosphere,
neither the Declaration nor the
Covenant might ever be approved.
Accordingly, the Economic and Social
Council, without debating the draft
Declaration, forwarded it to the
General Assembly for consideration
at its regular session in 1948.
The session opened at the Palais de
Chaillot in Paris in the presence of
M. Vincent Auriol, the President of the
French Republic. The Social, Humani¬
tarian and Cultural Committee (known
as the Third Committee) examined the
draft Declaration, while the Legal Com¬
mittee discussed a draft Convention
then under consideration on the pre¬
vention and punishment of genocide.
The ensuing discussions often
reached a high pitch of emotion, with
every delegation taking part, includ¬
ing those from Asia, Africa and Latin
America. The debate continued for
87 sessions in the Third Committee
of the General Assembly, presided
over by Mr. Charles Malik, of the
Lebanon, and for 10 meetings in
special committee.
The general form of the initial draft
supported by Mr. Peng Chun Chang,
of the Republic of China was
maintained; so also was the balance
between the two sets of rights estab¬
lished by the Commission on Human
Rights in Article 22. The Declaration
was abridged, however, to 30 Articles
preceded by the Preamble and the
Introduction. But it was also improv¬
ed and completed, especially as
regards the condemnation of all forms
of discrimination (Article 2), the right
of everyone to an effective remedy
by competent tribunal (Article 8), the
right to asylum (Article 14), the right
to a nationality (Article 15), the right
to marry, the rights of intending

HOW THE CHARTER WAS BORN (Continued)
Two great Covenants to reinforce the Declaration
6
spouses and the right to found a
family (Article 16), and the right to
take part in public life (Article 21).
Toward midnight on December 10,
1948 the General Assembly formally
adopted the Universal Declaration.
There were 48 votes in favour,
8 abstentions and not a single vote
against. After the adoption delegates
went to the rostrum to speak on their
vote. Few were the delegations that
failed to point out that the Declaration
was not binding on States in the same
manner as a Covenant. Six of the
eight abstaining countries were from
the Socialist countries of Eastern
Europe. They explained that they
found the Declaration "inadequate",
and one even termed it "old-fashion¬
ed". Mrs. Roosevelt described it as
an act of historic significance. The
President of the General Assembly,
Mr. Herbert Evatt, of Australia,
declared:
"Millions of men, women and chil¬
dren all over the world will turn for
help, guidance and inspiration to this
document."
The author of this article also took
the floor and spoke of the nature of
the Declaration, and particularly its
universality.
To my mind, the dominant feature
that characterizes the universality of
the Declaration is its broad scope and
content. The Declaration embraces
all the rights and freedoms essential
for the dignity and development of the
human personality, the right to life
and to physical and juridical freedom;
to spiritual and political freedom such
as freedom of conscience, opinion and
information; the right to work, to own
property, to education, to leisure, to
the benefits of culture, and to engage
in intellectual and artistic creation.
Originally conceived as an inter¬
national Declaration produced by
States for the benefit of the citizens
of those States, the Universal Declar¬
ation focussed increased attention
directly on man's relations with his
fellows and on a wide range of social
patterns such as the family, religion,
employment and professions, the city
and State, and society as a whole.
All members of the family of Man are
consequently encompassed within the
Declaration insofar as they are directly
subject to international law (¡us
gentium), irrespective of their original
or present status, and without dis¬
tinction of race, sex, creed, language,
birth, fortune, social condition or opin¬
ion. The Universal Declaration applies
to all States or territories regardless of
the political, juridical, economic or in¬
ternational status of the country, or
whether or not it is a member of the
United Nations.
Although the authors of the Declar¬
ation in no way attempted to avoid
direct references to the contempt for
human rights that had resulted in
barbarous acts which had outraged the
conscience of mankind, they refused
to turn the Declaration into a document
of acrimony and bitterness harking
back to the past. Instead, they sought
to erect the foundations for the
building of a better future.
The Declaration voices the deep-
rooted, enduring aspirations of all men
for liberty, equality and at least a
measure of security, whether the
society people live in is more advanc¬
ed and provides certain basic rights,
or underdeveloped and deprives them
of proper food, liberty and education.
In short, the Declaration sets forth
an ¡deal of achievement and marks out
the guide-lines for a vast programme
of positive action.
But a glance at the realities of life
today is enough to show that they
fall far short of the ¡deal. No country,
not even the most advanced, can
pride itself on fulfilling all the Articles
of the Declaration. Once the memory
of a war fought for certain principles
has ended or new countries have
acceded to independence, govern¬
ments are inclined to settle internal
problems without due regard for
human rights.
Repeated violations of the right to
life, killings and massacres left
unpunished, the exploitation of women,
mass hunger and starvation, the
perpetuation of slavery, lack of proper
education, disregard for freedom of
conscience, opinion and expression,
widespread racial discrimination and
segregation, arbitrary government all
these and many other abuses are far
too frequent to be denied.
I ET the Universal Declara¬
tion clearly indicates, in the final para¬
graphs of the Preamble, the prin¬
cipal measures that can be taken to
counter such abuses. Foremost
amongst these are teaching and
education, not only of the young but
of persons of all ages. Here Unesco
has had a vital role to play.
But this is not the only road open
for action. There are national measures
that are the primary responsibility of
governments but which can be carried
out with the support and co-operation
of different agencies of the United
Nations Family; there are many inter¬
national measures measures of pre¬
vention, measures of review, and if
need be, measures of censure and
punishment.
It took the Commission on Human
Rights six years (from 1948 to 1954)
and the General Assembly a further
thirteen years (from 1954 to December
16, 1966) first to draft and then to
consider and adopt the two great
Covenants which complete the United
Nations Charter of Human Rights.
The provisions contained in these
Covenants are not only binding on each
State party thereto but provide for
international machinery to ensure that
all States live up to their obligations
under the Covenants, as well as
appropriate machinery for action on
violations following complaints by
States or individuals (1).
But here too it will certainly take
a long time before these Covenants
are ratified by enough countries to
enter into force (35 ratifications are
needed for each Protocol), unless
public opinion in each country is
mobilized to bring strong pressure on
governments to speed ratification.
Nor can the Charter of Human Rights
become a real force unless persistent
efforts are made by world public
opinion to render its application effect¬
ive everywhere.
Despite the many difficulties that lie
ahead of us, we must not allow our
faith in the Universal Declaration, as
an instrument of power and action, to
flag. In the course of the past 20 years
it has grown in stature with the
access of more than 60 countries to
independence and membership in the
United Nations. It has served as a
banner for all persons who have
suffered mistreatment or persecution
in any form, and for non-religious as
well as religious groups everywhere.
But the influence of the Declaration
will certainly continue to grow in the
years to come, for it is founded on the
principle of the unity of mankind and
the dignity of the individual person.
Though regarded by some as little
more than an adjunct to the United
Nations Charter, the Universal Declar¬
ation of Human Rights incarnates the
moral principles of our time, and as
such, stands as a lasting monument
towering above national constitutions
and the statutes of all international
agencies which must now perforce
evolve and change.
The birth of the Universal Declar¬
ation marks a turning point in world
history. No longer can we allow the
cries of the oppressed to be stifled by
brutality or be lost in a maze of red
tape. All the more reason why the
court of man's conscience, though
besieged by many appeals, must not
allow itself to turn a deaf ear to these
pleas, and must organize its counter¬
action with increased vigour.
Now that we possess an instrument
capable of lifting or easing the burden
of oppression and injustice in the
world, we must learn to use it. As two
Director-Generals of Unesco, Jaime
Torres-Bodet and René Maheu, have
said, the Universal Declaration invol¬
ves the responsibility of all of us and
the responsibility of each one of us.
(J) The author is here referring ta the
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, and the Covenant on Civil and Poli¬
tical Rights. Individuals can complain about
violations of their rights if their countries
have ratified another legal instrument adopted
at the same time as the two Covenants.
This document ¡s known as the Optional
Protocol to the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. Editor.

30 QUESTIONS
ON HUMAN RIGHTS
O What are human rights?
Human rights are based on mankind's increasing demand
for a decent, civilized life in which the inherent dignity of
each human being will receive respect and protection. This
idea reaches beyond the comforts and conveniences that
science and technology can provide. We do not speak
merely of biological needs when we talk about human
rights; we mean those conditions of life which allow us
fully to develop and use our human qualities of intelligence
and conscience and to satisfy our spiritual needs. Human
rights are fundamental to our nature; without them, we can¬
not live as human beings.
To deny human beings their rights is to set the stage
for political and social unrest wars, hostility between
nations and between groups within a nation and leads
to urgent demands for a better life in larger freedom.
Human rights, far from being an abstract subject for philo¬
sophers and lawyers, affect the daily lives of everyone
man, woman and child.
Broadly speaking, two kinds of rights are recognized in
the Universal Declaration. First there is the traditional
kind, civil and political rights, which gradually evolved over
centuries during the long development of democratic so¬
ciety. Then there are economic, social and cultural rights,
which started to be recognized more recently when people
realized that possession of certain political and civil rights /
would be valueless without the simultaneous enjoyment
of certain rights of an economic, social and cultural
character.

30 QUESTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS (Continued)
8
»3 What are civil and political rights?
First, we should all have the right to life, liberty
and the security of our persons. We must not be held
in slavery, or punished in an inhuman or degrading way.
All of us should be equal before the law. We must not
be arrested or exiled purely because of someone's whim.
We should be entitled to a fair hearing if someone charges
us with a crime, and we must be presumed innocent until
proved guilty.
Our privacy, family , home and correspondence must be
protected against arbitrary interference. If we are perse¬
cuted, we should be able to seek asylum in another country.
We should have the right to a nationality. We should be
able to marry and found a family, and our family should
be entitled to protection. We should have the right to
own property.
Then there are the well-known fundamental freedoms:
freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of
opinion and expression, and the freedom to join with others
in peaceful assembly and association. Also, everyone
should have the right to take part in the government of
his country, through elections and through equal access
with anyone else to jobs in the public service.
Q What are economic and social rights?
They include the right to work, to free choice of jobs,
to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection
against unemployment. Every man or woman should be
entitled to the same pay if he or she does the same
work. All of us should have the right to rest and leisure.
An adequate standard of living is another of our rights,
and this means enough food, clothing, housing, medical and
social services, and social security. Mothers and children
should be entitled to special care and assistance. Every¬
one should have the right to education, and the right freely
to participate in the cultural life of the community.
Q Who says these are our rights?
Philosophers and the greatest figures in world history
have been stressing and developing the concept of human
rights from the beginning of civilized life, and the United
Nations has reaffirmed them. All of the political, civil,
economic, social and cultural rights mentioned here are set
out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
the United Nations General Assembly adopted on Dec¬
ember 10, 1948, with not a single country voting against.
The Declaration itself states that it is a common standard
of achievement for all peoples and all nations, and not
a binding set of rules. But the mere fact that the
Declaration was solemnly accepted by so many countries
of such varying cultural, economic and political back¬
grounds implies that those countries are ready to promote
the rights they have themselves proclaimed. The Decla¬
ration has been incorporated in the constitutions of a
number of countries and its wording is reflected in many
other constitutions.
^ Why doesn't the United Nations go beyond the
Declaration and try to write these rights into law?
It has done just that, by drawing up two International
Covenants on Human Rights the Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and the Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights. Both of them were adopted unanimously
by the General Assembly on December 16, 1966.
Each Covenant will enter into force when 35 states
have ratified or acceded to it. The Protocol to the Cov¬
enant on Civil and Political Rights (see question 10)
requires 10 ratifications or accessions. As of November
1967, no government had yet ratified or acceded to
any of these three instruments. However, 19 states had
signed the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, 18 had signed the Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and eight of these had also signed the Protocol.
Once the Covenants come into effect, they will be legally
binding treaties between the states which ratify them.
They contain arrangements for international review of how
states carry out their obligations under the Covenants.
The Covenants define the various rights more precisely.
The article dealing with guarantees for the person charged
with a crime lists seven minimum guarantees, including the
right to a prompt trial and to legal assistance. A few rights
mentioned in the Declaration are not dealt with in the Cov¬
enants, while some rights not mentioned in the Declaration
are set out in the Covenants notably, the right of self-
determination, the right of all peoples to determine their
political status and to pursue their economic, social and
cultural development.
Q Are all of the rights set out in the Covenants to
be given effect immediately?
By and large, all of the obligations which a state assumes
under the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are meant
to be implemented as soon as that state ratifies the Cov¬
enant. The Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights, however, states that its provisions are to be carried
out progressively. There is a difference between a right such
as freedom of thought and expression, which can be put into
effect immediately by any country, and a right like the right
to education, which requires money, teachers and buildings
before everybody can enjoy it.
Q Isn't there too much stress on rights and too little
on duties?
Rights and duties are opposite sides of the same coin.
When the U.N. or anyone else calls for respect for human
rights, they mean not only that our rights must be observed
but also that we must respect the rights of others.
Q How can the United Nations be sure that all states
live up to their promises under the Covenants?
By obliging them to report to an international body
on the measures which they have taken and the progress
they have made. Both Covenants provide for such a
reporting procedure. In the case of the Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations
Economic and Social Council is the body which will study
these reports. It may rely on the Commission on Human
Rights and the specialized agencies of the United Nations
for expert assistance. In the case of the Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, a special Human Rights Commit¬
tee will be set up to deal with the reports.
Q What happens if two states disagree on whether
one of them is fulfilling its obligations?
The Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides for
a special procedure in case such a disagreement should
arise. Suppose State A thinks that State B is not allowing
an ethnic or religious minority to enjoy its own culture or
practise its own religion. If a solution cannot be reached
by direct negotiation, State A may contact the Human
Rights Committee about the matter, since such minority
rights are provided for in the Covenant on Civil and Poli¬
tical Rights. The Committee may look into the complaint
and take it up with State B to try to work out a settlement.
If no agreement is worked out, the Committee may report
on the facts of the case.
This procedure will apply only between two states which
agree in advance to allow the Human Rights Committee to
deal with such questions affecting them.
(¿) Will individuals be able to complain about
violations of their rights?
Only if their countries have ratified another legal instru¬
ment which the General Assembly adopted at the same

30 QUESTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS (Continued)
time as the two Covenants the Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The
procedure under the Protocol works this way: suppose
Mr. Smith, who lives in Country A, claims that his right
to freedom of expression has been violated by his own
Government. If his country is a party to the Protocol and
to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and if he
has tried without success to obtain satisfaction within his
country, Mr. Smith may complain to the Human Rights
Committee. The Committee may then take up the com¬
plaint and forward its view to the country concerned and to
Mr. Smith. The Committee is to report annually to the
General Assembly on its activities under the Protocol.
(P Will the United Nations be able to order a country
to comply with its human rights obligations?
Each country will have the final say in human rights
questions, and no international organ will be able to over¬
ride the authority of the supreme organs in each state.
It is logical and expected, however, that states will find
inspiration for their attitudes and actions, as regards the
human rights of their nationals, in the standards elaborated
by the international community as represented by the United
Nations.
(^ What use is the international machinery for imple¬
menting the Covenants if countries are. to have
the final say ¡n individual cases?
The main instrument at the disposal of the international
community and it can be a most effective instrument
is exposure to world public opinion. The reporting pro¬
cedure under the International Covenants Is designed to
publicize the progress made by each country in achieving
human rights, and the obstacles encountered by each
country. The conciliation procedure is intended to help
countries iron out disagreements in particular cases, and
governments will be able to make use of this procedure
in the knowledge that, if conciliation fails, an issue which
they consider important will be aired before the world.
True, the international machinery will be far from1 all-
powerful; but this should not obscure the fact that the
implementation of the Covenants will mark a giant step
forward in giving effect to international concern about
human rights.
(J) What other human rights conventions has the
United Nations adopted in the past 20 years?
Once the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was
proclaimed In 1948, the United Nations immediately set
out to adopt treaties on a number of specific rights. These
deal with genocide, racial discrimination, refugees, stateless
persons, the rights of women, slavery and freedom of
information. These conventions are in effect between the
states which have become parties to them.
(£) What has been done about genocide?
The crimes perpetrated against whole groups of innocent
people during the Second World War led the General
Assembly, in 1948, to adopt the Convention on the Preven¬
tion and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Genocide
is defined in the Convention as the committing of certain
acts with intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or
religious group. Genocide is characterized as a crime
under international law, whether committed in time of
peace or of war. Seventy states have become parties
to this Convention.
10© What about racial discrimination?
The United Nations has been especially concerned about
racial discrimination in recent years and has devoted much
of its action to its consideration. Many newly Independent
countries, with vivid memories of colonialism, have been par¬
ticularly concerned at the continuance in power of regimes
in southern Africa and elsewhere which are based on the
dominance of a white minority over a black majority.
In taking political action to try to change the policies
of the regimes in South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and the
territories under Portuguese administration, the United
Nations is aware that racial discrimination and theories of
racial superiority underlie many of the political problems
with which it has to deal. The General Assembly has
frequently condemned those racial policies.
In 1965, It adopted the International Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. When
states become parties to this Convention, they undertake
to pursue without delay a policy of eliminating racial discrim¬
ination in all its forms and promoting understanding among
all races. The Convention will come into force when
27 states ratify or accede to it. As of October 16, 1967,
16 countries had done so.
One of the most effective ways in which the United
Nations can combat racial discrimination is by exposing it
to world opinion. The United Nations cannot force govern¬
ments and peoples to comply with its wishes in this field,
but it can bring to their attention the evils and danger
of discrimination and suggest ways of eliminating it. This
is the objective of the International Day for the Elimination
of Racial Discrimination, which was commemorated for the
first time in 1967.
dp Is the United Nations concerned with other types
of discrimination?
Yes. The U.N. Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, set up in 1947,
has been studying discriminatory practices based on other
grounds than race and colour, including religion and political
opinion. The General Assembly took up a draft Conven¬
tion on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance
at its 1967 session.
Agencies related to the United Nations have also acted
against discrimination in their respective fields. Unesco
has adopted a Convention against Discrimination in Educa¬
tion. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has
approved a Convention concerning Discrimination in Em¬
ployment and Occupation. Both Conventions call for
periodic reports by governments on what they are doing
to carry out the provisions. There are also arrangements
for settling disputes.
(¡) What about discrimination against women?
The Commission on the Status of Women prepared a
draft Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women, which the General Assembly adopted on Novem¬
ber 7, 1967. But long before the idea of such a decla¬
ration arose, the United Nations began promoting women's
rights through a series of measures.
A Convention on the Political Rights of Women, adopted
by the General Assembly in 1952, provides that women shall
have equal rights with men in voting, election to public
bodies and the exercise of public functions. (As late as
1966, while women had equal voting rights with men in
114 countries, they were denied those rights in eight
countries.)
A Convention on the Nationality of Married Women,
adopted in 1957, provides that a woman's nationality shall
not automatically be affected just because she marries
a man of another nationality. Another United Nations
Convention, adopted in 1962, says that no marriage shall be
legal without the full and free consent of both parties,
expressed in person.
The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women has sought
to encourage the participation of women in vocational, tech¬
nical and training programmes, it has recommended steps
]]>

<![CDATA[
to promote the access of girls and women to higher educa¬
tion, and it has asked that mothers be given equal rights
with fathers in the upbringing of their children.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) and Unesco
have also actively promoted women's rights, ILO through a
Convention intended to ensure that, when men and women
perform equal work, they receive equal pay, and Unesco
through its efforts to promote equal access to education
for women.
(£) What has the United Nations done
to help refugees?
Some of the most practical work done by the United
Nations in the entire field of human rights is its assistance
to refugees. The fate of more than three million victims
of war, persecution and other upheavals concerns the
United Nations today. Some of these are fed from United
Nations rations mainly, hundreds of thousands of Arab
refugees from Palestine, who are cared for by the United
Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees
in the Near East (UNRWA). Many of these refugees
UNRWA had more than a million on its rolls at the begin¬
ning of 1967 are housed, clothed and educated by the
Agency, at least in part. A large number of them were
displaced for a second time by the Middle East fighting of
June 1967.
More than two million refugees elsewhere in the world
come under the mandate of the United Nations High Com¬
missioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The High Commis¬
sioner's Office was able to report the closing in 1966 of the
last refugee camps in Europe. However, more than half a
million new refugees in Africa are outside their home coun¬
tries, and the High Commissioner is helping to repatriate
or resettle them.
(£) Is anything being done about the problem of
stateless persons in general?
The 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless
Persons sets out the standards of treatment for persons
who do not have a nationality of their own. To deal with the
problem of reducing future statelessness, the United Nations
has adopted a Convention to help people acquire a nation¬
ality at birth and limit the circumstances in which they
lose a nationality without acquiring another. However this
Convention, adopted in 1961, is not yet in force. The
complexity and variety of nationality laws makes this a most
difficult subject to deal with.
^) What about freedom of information?
The General Assembly has recognized that this freedom
is the touchstone of all freedoms. However, efforts to
embody in a written text a precise definition of this free¬
dom have not yet been successful. One of the main
problems Is that different countries have different ideas
about the role of the Press in society. Nevertheless, the
Assembly keeps the question of freedom of information
constantly under review, including proposals for both a
declaration and a convention on the subject.
Meanwhile the Assembly has adopted a Convention on
the International Right of Correction. This Convention,
which came into force in 1962, is designed to enable states
to have publicized in another country corrections to news
dispatches published in that country which they consider
false or distorted. Eight states had become parties to
the Convention as of September 21, 1967.
Q) What is being done about the rights
of the worker?
This subject is the principal concern of ILO, which has
adopted more than 250 Conventions and Recommendations,
making up an International Labour Code that deals with
everything from hours of work and minimum wages to
maternity protection, from industrial accidents to night
work for women. Among its Conventions is one on the
abolition of forced labour and another to protect freedom
of association and the right of workers to organize trade
unions.
The ILO also gives advice to Governments on ways to
ensure that labour standards are adhered to by employers
and employees. It has special machinery for considering
violations of trade union rights. Almost all of the work
of ILO is concerned with safeguarding the human rights
of the worker.
ÇQ Does slavery still exist and is it still being fought?
Slavery and practices similar to slavery are still to be
found in some parts of the world, and the matter is still
actively before the United Nations. The parties to two
Conventions on slavery pledge themselves to prevent and
suppress the slave trade and bring about the complete
abolition of all forms of slavery. One of these Conventions
outlaws certain institutions and practices similar to slavery
such as debt bondage, serfdom, purchase of brides and
exploitation of child labour. Further measures to put an
end to slavery are being studied by several United Nations
bodies (see page 32).
^ Is special consideration being given to the rights
of children?
The rights and well-being of the world's children are
the prime concern of one of the best-known United Nations
agencies the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
which promotes the rights of the child by providing medicine
and medical equipment, jeeps and bicycles for public
health and community development workers, science kits
for pilot schools, tools for vocational training, pipes and
pumps for village sanitation, stipends to pay for the training
of teachers. UNICEF is the oldest of the post-war United
Nations agencies set up to provide direct assistance where
it is most needed and still working for the welfare of
mankind. To focus the world's attention on goals, the
General Assembly in 1959 unanimously adopted a Decla¬
ration of the Rights of the Child.
KQ What about youth and human rights?
The General Assembly in 1965 adopted by acclamation
the Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals
of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between
Peoples. The Declaration sets out the principles which
should guide not only young people but also the adults who
are concerned with their education and welfare to develop
attachment to the ideals of peace, liberty and the dignity
and equality of all men, and stresses the role of the
family in achieving these aims.
^) What about the right to education?
In a world where almost one child in two grows up
without any education because schools are lacking, and
where four out of ten adults cannot read or write, a massive
effort is needed to give substance to the right to education.
Unesco is helping the developing countries to plan their
educational programmes, train teachers, build inexpensive
schools, modernize their curricula and produce good text¬
books.
In 1965, Unesco launched an international literacy cam- *u
paign. With funds supplied by the United Nations Develop- I I
ment Programme and by the governments concerned, six
major pilot literacy projects are now under way. The
Director-General of Unesco has proposed that the world

30 QUESTIONS ON HUMAN RIGHTS (Continued)

set itself a target: to wipe out illiteracy, and assure every
child at least six years of education by the end of the
century.
^) Do means already exist for individuals to
complain to the United Nations if they consider
their rights have been violated?
The United Nations receives many complaints from
individuals and groups alleging violations of human rights.
However, it can take little action on such complaints.
These communications are made available every year,
for information purposes and on a confidential basis, to
the Human Rights Commission and its Sub-Commission
on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minor¬
ities. Specific complaints are brought to the attention
of the Governments concerned. There is a special proce¬
dure for dealing with petitions from individuals or groups
concerning conditions in United Nations Trust Territories.
Qf) What does the work of the U.N. Trusteeship
Council and the Committee on the ending of
colonialism have to do with human rights?
The Trusteeship Council, in overseeing the administra¬
tion of Trust Territories, looks into political, economic,
social and educational conditions in each one of them. It
may call for greater participation by the local people in
government, more job opportunities, improved welfare
schemes of better schools all concerned with human rights.
There are three Trust Territories left Nauru, New Guinea
and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Once there
were eleven; the eight others have already attained the
main goal of the Trusteeship System independence or
self-government. In a number of cases, this came about
as a result of referenda supervised by the United Nations.
Implementing the right of self-determination is the main
concern of the Committee on the ending of colonialism.
The Committee may call for general elections with universal
adult suffrage, the handing over of powers to an elected
government, the holding of a constitutional convention, the
organization of a referendum, or the granting of indepen¬
dence by a certain date.
^) What is being done to commemorate the twentieth
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights?
The General Assembly has designated 1968 as Inter¬
national Year for Human Rights. Many activities, ceremonies
and observances have been planned by the United Nations,
by regional organizations, by national governments and
by private organizations.
But the General Assembly wants the occasion to be
much more than a celebration of past events. It has
suggested that 1968 be devoted to national and internation¬
al efforts in the field of human rights and also to an
international review of achievements in this field. Speci¬
fically, it asked that states become parties to the existing
human rights conventions and it decided to hasten the
conclusion of other such instruments.
In April 1968, a world-wide meeting, the United Nations
International Conference on Human Rights, will be held
in Teheran, Iran, to review progress since the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948. It will
evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used by the
United Nations in the field of human rights, and prepare
a programme of further measures to be taken after 1968.
^) How will the U.N.'s human rights activities
develop in future?
First, the coming into force of the Convention on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and of the International
Covenants on Human Rights, when enough states ratify
them, will bring into existence new international machinery
and confer new responsibilities on existing United Nations
bodies.
Second, besides the important advances in setting human
rights standards, significant steps are being taken to
enable the United Nations to play a role complementary
to that of governments in extending respect for human
rights and in preventing gross violations. Recent decisions
of the Economic and Social Council permit a study by the
Commission on Human Rights of situations that reveal
consistent violations of human rights, such as policies of
apartheid and racial discrimination. The General Assembly
is studying a proposal to appoint a United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (see page 26).
This resurgence of activity in the promotion and defence
of human rights, coupled with the reassessment of United
Nations work in this field during 1968, could lead to ever-
greater responsibilities for the international community in
the protection and promotion of human rights. Whether the
United Nations will, in fact, be given this wider role depends
on the decisions of the governments and the support of
peoples.
© What can the individual do?
The first duty of the individual citizen with regard to
human rights may seem so simple and obvious that many
of us neglect it: it is to understand what our human rights
are, so that when they are violated, we can recognize the
act as a violation.
To take one example: when a youth of obvious ability is
unable to go to college because he lacks the financial
means, our reaction may be no more than mild sympathy.
When we recognize, however, that such a situation may be
contrary to the principle that higher education shall be equal¬
ly accessible to all on the basis of merit, as proclaimed in
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we may take
a more serious view of the situation and try to find
remedies.
Once we understand our rights, our next responsibility
is to promote them for others as well as for ourselves.
And that responsibility begins with the people around us,
for it is in our local communities that we have most influence.
Acting on our own and in concert with others in non¬
governmental organizations, we can remedy human rights
violations and promote respect for rights at home. We
can each strive to enable our own countries to set a good
example for the rest of the world. And we can learn from
the experiences of others by reading about what other
countries are doing to promote human rights for their
own peoples.
The problem of protecting and promoting human rights,
in the broadest sense, is the main concern of the United
Nations. Since rights cannot be enjoyed fully if a person
cannot earn a living and feed a family, all of the economic
and social development programmes of the international
community are essentially programmes to advance human
rights. Since a person cannot be free if the nation to
which he or she belongs is not allowed to decide its own
destiny through the exercise of the right to self-deter¬
mination, the efforts of the United Nations to promote the
granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples
are basically human rights efforts.
Our world consists of diverse political ideologies and
racial origins, various religious beliefs and different degrees
of economic development. When, out of this diversity, we
develop common standards of human rights and respect
for human dignity everywhere, we create a profound bond
between men which is essential for maintaning peaceful
relations among nations and for fruitful economic, social
and cultural co-operation.
These 30 questions on human rights are taken from "The United
Nations and the Human Person Questions and Answers on Human
Rights', a U N. pamphlet to be published this year in English, French
and Spanish.

UNESCO
AND
i,
RIGHTS
For a full report on Unesco's
work on behalf of human rights
the reader is referred to a study
prepared by the Director-General
of Unesco for the International
Conference on Human Rights
convened by the United Nations
in Teheran in April.
14
he purpose of Unesco, according to its Constitution, is "to contri¬
bute to peace and security by promoting collaboration among the nations
through education, science and culture in order to further universal respect
for justice, for the rule of law and for the human rights and fundamental
freedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world, without distinc¬
tion of race, sex, language or religion..."
Accordingly, all Unesco programmes are drawn up with these supreme
aims in view. In all sectors of its activity be it education or the natural
sciences, social and human sciences or cufture and communication
Unesco's ultimate purpose is founded on the defence of Human Rights
which is indissolubly linked with the defence of Peace.
Even those Unesco activities which are not aimed specifically and expli¬
citly at fostering one aspect of human rights or human rights in general,
nevertheless serve to create the material and intellectual, the moral and
cultural conditions which are indispensable if human rights are to become
a living reality for all human beings and not just principles and aspirations.
Unesco further believes that economic and social development must be
viewed as the achievement of those conditions that are essential to the
full exercise of human rights.
Education indirectly serves the cause of human rights as a sine qua non
of development, and promotes human rights directly by endowing every
human being with the faculties all men need in order to exercise and draw
benefit from these rights. Education, moreover, is one of the basic rights
specifically proclaimed in the Universal Declaration.
Modern scientific advances, adapted to the needs of development, are
radically transforming the material conditions of life today, and should
make it easier now to provide for man's everyday needs by increasing
government resources and thereby help to reduce many of the difficulties
that now hamper the achievement of economic, social and cultural rights
in many countries.
Moreover, as modern science and technology transform the face of our
planet and the conditions of life of its inhabitants, an understanding of
science and the scientific approach becomes a fundamental right for
everyone. An initiation into science is indeed indispensable if man is to
understand his world and his place within it, and to assess his own
potentialities and limitations.
The spread of culture, universal access to the literary and artistic master¬
pieces of all peoples, helps to promote mutual understanding and a keener
awareness of man's universal heritage with its rich diversity of cultural
treasures. Hence the immense value of cultural exchanges in fostering
international understanding and friendship.
Radio, television, films, newspapers, indeed, all the modern means of
communication are essential in promoting human rights, and are specifi¬
cally referred to in Article 19: "Everyone has the right to... receive and
impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of fron¬
tiers."
Unesco has striven to create or improve mass media channels in
countries where they are most needed. Of course, tha mass media can
be used to publicize all the human rights and the related principles laid
down by the United Nations.
The aid of the social sciences is often enlisted in the struggle to eradi¬
cate discrimination and racial or religious prejudices. These sciences facil¬
itate the study and analysis of the ideas which men may have concerning
their rights; and they can also help to overcome problems that arise in
securing certain rights, when local traditions and differing economic and
social conditions must be taken into account.
Thus, as much by its nature and the fields in which it operates as by its
aims and objectives, Unesco's entire activity is designed to promote the
whole range of human rights.

'ONLY
THE EDUCATED
ARE FREE'
EPICTETUS
by Louis François
I
HE road from the procla¬
mation of the right to education to its
achievement is long, arduous and beset
with obstacles of all kinds. Progress
has been slower and more difficult
than was foreseen. After 20 years of
effort, many nations are still striving to
attain" the goal of education for all
And it still seems remote, even to
those which have made the greatest
headway. Indeed, it is constantly
receding in the changing world in
which we live.
Let us look at some of the prob¬
lems created by the population explo¬
sion the Demographic Revolution as
it is often called. World population
reached 3,000 million in 1960; it may
exceed 4,000 million by 1980 and will
be close to 6,000 million by the year
2000. In the forefront of this surging
population increase are the develop¬
ing countries. Latin America and
Africa have the highest percentage of
population increase and are slightly
ahead of Asia, for which complete sta¬
tistics are not always available.
North America and the U.S.S.R. have
a rate of increase double that of
Europe, which puts them close behind
Latin America and Africa. But the
truly significant fact is that the deve¬
loping countries, which have the great-

THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION
Everyone has the right to education. Education
shall be free, at least in the elementary and
fundamental stages. Elementary education
shall be compulsory. Technical and professional
education shall be made generally available
and higher education shall be equally accessible
to all on the basis of merit...
Article 26 of the Universal Declaration

'ONLY THE EDUCATED ARE FREE' (Continued)
A global target:
every child in school by 1980
est needs in education, now comprise
two-thirds of the world's population,
and according to present estimates
will account for 70 per cent in 1980 and
nearly 75 per cent by the year 2000.
Moreover, as world population in¬
creases, its average age decreases.
Thus the first obstacle that education
must overcome is one of quantity. The
first task of any Minister of Education
Is to provide enough schools and
teachers for the rapidly-increasing
mass of young people.
The developing
countries
Needless to say, the countries of
Latin America, Africa and Asia did
not wait for the adoption of the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights
before dealing with their educational
problems. All of them, whether in¬
dependent states or colonial territories,
have long had educational policies and
programmes.
But only a certain number of the
children in each age group was being
enrolled in school each year so that
despite efforts to extend educa¬
tion, the educated section of the popu¬
lation actually diminished in proportion
to the far larger mass of uneducated
citizens. The situation was comparable
to that of a ship moving at a speed of
eight knots against a current flowing
at twelve knots and thus being push¬
ed back.
During the last ten years this move¬
ment has been reversed. The ship
now seems to be equipped with a
motor powerful enough to overcome
the current. The rate of school enrol¬
ment is increasing more rapidly than
that of corresponding age groups.
The number of teachers is also rising
though at a slightly lower rate, which
poses the question, "Can teaching
standards be maintained?"
At regional conferences organized
by Unesco, developing countries have
set the goals they wish to attain by
1980. The conference at Addis Ababa
in 1961, concerned with Africa's edu¬
cational problems, fixed the enrolment
target for primary education at 100
per cent, for secondary education at
23 per cent, and for higher education
at 2 per cent (1).
The Latin American countries have
been independent for 150 years. They
have absorbed a large number of
Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking im¬
migrants from Europe. And for ten
years they have been helped by
Unesco's Major Project, designed to
extend and improve primary educa¬
tion in Latin America. Greater edu¬
cational progress has thus been made
in this continent than in the other deve¬
loping regions.
But progress in primary education
has been far from uniform. Bolivia
with an enrolment of 40 per cent and
Brazil with 50 per cent obviously still
have far to go. Other countries
Colombia, where enrolment increased
from 42 per cent in 1950 to 80 per cent
in 1965; Panama with 85 per cent,
Uruguay and Argentina with 95 per
cent and Trinidad and Tobago with
97 per cent have fewer difficulties
to overcome.
While enrolment in primary schools
manages more or less to keep pace
with the general growth of population,
far more rapid progress has been made
in secondary and higher education, be¬
cause of efforts being made to train
supervisors and highly skilled workers
and to create a more balanced society.
An admirable feature of education in
Latin America is the absence of any
discrimination based on sex, race or
religion. On the other hand economic
and social conditions, favourable to a
small minority, but a crushing burden
to the rest, have far-reaching effects
on the spread of education.
These conditions are responsible for
many of the obstacles limiting access
to education: the low level of econo¬
mic development, the limited means of
many families, the lack of national re¬
sources, a widely-dispersed population
and a disdain for. technical and voca¬
tional education.
(1) Primary education is considered here
as elementary education for children between
6-7 and 11-12 years of age, secondary edu¬
cation as general or technical education for
the 11-12 to 18-19 age group; and higher
education as that given in universities and
technical institutes to students between
19 and 25 years of age.

South and South-East Asia, stretch¬
ing from Iran to Indonesia and the
Philippines, comprise vast sparsely-
populated territories and some of the
world's most densely populated areas.
Here live 25 per cent of the world's
inhabitants, 565 million of them in India
and Pakistan, interlocked in the Indian
sub-continent. In India alone 12 mil¬
lion children are born each year, and
schools and teachers for them will have
to be provided in the near future.
In this part of the world, 54 million
children were going to school in 1950;
by 1960, 92 million. Yet this enormous
figure represents less than half of
the school-age population of the re¬
gion. School enrolments had then
reached 90 per cent in Malaysia, 75 per
cent in Ceylon and the Philippines,
50 per cent in Viet Nam, 45 per cent in
Indonesia, 40 per cent in India, 35 per
cent in Iran, 25 per cent in Pakistan,
15 per cent in Nepal and 7 per cent in
Afghanistan. In the schools of India
and Pakistan boys outnumbered girls
three to one.
Meeting under Unesco's auspices at
Karachi (Pakistan) in 1960 (2), all these
countries adopted the Karachi Plan, as
it came to be called, whose aim is
to provide at least seven years of free
and compulsory education for all chil¬
dren before 1980. The number of
teachers will increase threefold and the
average cost of education per child
will rise from $8.00 to $20.00 a year
(it will still be only one quarter of
today's per capita cost of primary
education in some developed coun¬
tries).
Secondary and higher education will
also need to be vastly expanded to
provide more teachers, and also to
train skilled personnel for the economic
development programmes that are vital
to the success of the Karachi Plan.
A radical change of emphasis in edu¬
cation is also called for. Today, ten
million students in South and South-
East Asia receive a general education
while only one million take technical
and vocational training courses. In¬
dian universities each year turn out
116,000 arts graduates and 25,000 in
law, but only 8,000 in the sciences,
5,000 in engineering and 4,000 in agri¬
culture.
The Karachi Plan is imaginative and
far-reaching. But educational expan-

(2) That year, the General Conference of
Unesco unanimously adopted a Convention
and an International Recommendation con¬
cerning discrimination in education. These
aim to promote equality of opportunity and
treatment for all in education, and to abolish
discrimination based on race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political or other opinion,
national or social origin, economic condition
or birth. As of December 1967, 39 states
were parties to the Unesco Convention.

'ONLY THE EDUCATED ARE FREE' (Continued from page 16)
Can education outpace
the population explosion ?
sion will have difficulty in keeping up
with the runaway growth of population
in these regions.
There was no delay in putting the
plan into operation. Between 1960
and 1965 school enrolment rose
rapidly to over 30 million. The rates
are still rising everywhere: they have
reached 80 per cent In India, 67 per
cent in Viet Nam, in spite of the
war, 42 per cent in Iran, and 14 per
cent in Afghanistan, although this
country fears that by 1980 it may be
only half way to attaining the targets
set at Karachi.
A special effort is being made in
rural areas to render education more
accessible to girls and to provide tech-
20
nical education. But funds are still
too limited to make good the lack of
buildings, textbooks and audio-visual
teaching equipment.
Between 1965 and 1970 places will
have to be found for a further 40 mil¬
lion children in primary schools, 12 mil¬
lion more in secondary schools and
one million more students in universi¬
ties and institutes of higher education.
Over 1,154,000 more primary teachers
and 250,000 more secondary teachers
will be needed. These figures speak
for themselves.
In the Arab countries, great progress
has been made. Between 1960 and
1966 the population rose from 92 mil¬
lion to 105 million while the school and

However, it is estimated that 8 mil¬
lion children are not yet in school. The
Arab countries have a very high pro¬
portion of young people: those under
20 account for 50 per cent of the popu¬
lation and those between 5 and 11
years of age for 17 per cent. In Euro¬
pean countries the corresponding pro¬
portions are 30 per cent and 11 per
cent.
Educational development throughout
the region is still uneven. Country
children are less well provided for than
those in cities. Girls are still in the
minority in the classroom (1 in 3 in
primary schools, 1 in 4 in secondary
schools and 1 in 5 in institutes of
higher education). There are no
special arrangements for handicapped
children. Either they attend ordinary
classes (with scant benefit) or they
remain illiterate. Too few technical
and vocational courses are provided in
secondary schools (only enough for
1 pupil out of 8 today). And education
in general is badly handicapped by a

lack of buildings, equipment and
teachers, although the teacher shortage
is now being offset to some extent by
the recruitment of teachers from other
countries.
The Arab countries' main sources of
income are agriculture and oil. Land
reform and the improvement of agri¬
cultural methods, the development of
new resources and, in particular, the
expansion and modernization of
industry will depend to a large extent
on the education received by young
people at all levels. Increasingly, the
educated woman becomes the most
effective factor in the promotion of
children's education. Here, as else¬
where, the worth of the individual as
the means and the end in all things, is
the core and driving force in economic
development.
Africa, or almost all of Africa, is now
independent, after entering the inter¬
national scene in 1960. The year 1960
was indeed a crucial one. The newly
independent states faced immense
tasks In education. The average rate
of school enrolment in the African
countries as a whole was only 16 per
cent, varying between 2 per cent and
60 per cent from one country to an¬
other. In most countries, 4 out of
5 children were not in school; girls
accounted for less than 30 per cent of
primary school enrolments and less
than 22 per cent in the case of secon¬
dary schools. In some countries not
even one girl out of 10 was in school.
A MONG the states which
had emerged from the French
Community, Cameroon, in 1960, led in
terms of primary school enrolment.
The coastal states of the Gulf of
Guinea, which were the most
prosperous, had more firmly-estab¬
lished educational systems than
the less populated states to the north.
Mali for instance had only one techni¬
cal college with 600 places and a single
lycée. The few pupils who obtained
their baccalauréat (secondary leaving
certificate) from this school were the
only likely candidates for positions
of responsibility in a state with a popu¬
lation of 4,500,000 and covering an
area of 1,200,000 square kilometres
(480,000 square miles).
At the 1961 Unesco-sponsored Con¬
ference of Ministers of Education of
the African States in Addis-Ababa, the
whole of Africa, from the countries of
tropical Africa south of the Sahara to
those of North Africa, met and took
decisions similar to those made at
Karachi States undertook to achieve
the following targets over the next
twenty years:
six years of free and compulsory
primary education, given by qualified
teachers;
secondary education comprising two
cycles of three years, from which 30
per cent of primary school pupils would
benefit;
higher education for 20 per cent of
secondary school pupils, which would
9 African students out of 10 to
study in Africa instead of abroad;
complete equality of access to edu¬
cation between boys and girls.
Since then, progress has been rapid
and impressive. Between 1960 and
1965, primary school enrolment in¬
creased from 7 per cent to 20 per cent
in Mali, from 14 per cent to 21 per cent
in Chad, from 24 per cent to 52 per
cent in Senegal, and from 29 per cent
to 60 per cent in Togo.
Nigeria has extended primary edu¬
cation in its southern provinces. In
Algerian schools there are now almost
as many girls as boys; and in those of
Somalia, there is one girl for every
three boys.
An even greater effort has been
made in secondary education. In Se¬
negal, for example, where primary
school enrolments have doubled, those
In secondary schools have risen nearly
threefold from 9,000 to 24,000
(though so far only 2,500 in technical
schools).
As we have seen, all the developing
countries from Latin America to South
Asia face the same problems, are
fired by identical aspirations and have
launched similar projects. They are
developing compulsory primary edu¬
cation and extending it from 4 years
to 7 or 8; they are reinforcing secon¬
dary education and creating institu¬
tions of higher education to train spe¬
cialists and technicians for future pro¬
grammes of development.
To achieve all this they will have
to enrol, between 1965 and 1970, a
further 52 million children in primary
schools, 15 million in secondary
schools and 1,500,000 students in the
universities. They will also need to
tram a further 2,500,000 primary
teachers and nearly 1,000,000 seconda¬
ry teachers.
Everywhere, education is struggling
to keep ahead of the steeply rising
population. Two major obstacles are
slowing down the rate of progress:
shortage of funds and shortage of
teachers. Even if some countries were
to devote the whole of their national
budgets to education, they would still
be unable to provide universal school¬
ing for their children.
ANY countries are obliged
to recruit foreign teachers. Mali
employs teachers from France, the
USS.R., the U.K., the U.S A., Canada,
the United Arab Republic, Israel and
Viet Nam. Some 1,700 of Morocco's
27,000 primary teachers, 4,340 of its
7,120 secondary teachers and 279 of
its 450 teachers in higher education
have come from other countries. In
Senegal, only 9 per cent of the
teachers are Senegalese. In Uganda,
Kenya, Somalia and Cambodia, the
great majority of secondary school¬
teachers have come from abroad.
In their efforts to deal with the rise
in school enrolment, the developing
countries clearly need international
assistance and technical co-operation,
especially during the difficult initial
period of newly-launched educational
programmes.
Through their own efforts and with
the help of the international commu¬
nity, the developing countries hope to
build up a complete, sound and effi¬
cient educational system by the end
of the 20th century, thereby making
the Right to Education a reality for
their citizens.
The economically
developed countries
Requests by the developing coun¬
tries for funds and specialists have
become more pressing at the very time
when the economically-developed
countries themselves are at grips with
the problem of rising school popula¬
tions.
These countries have of course long
possessed well organized educational
systems and their resources in teaching
staff are, relatively speaking, very
great. However, the astounding in¬
crease in the number of school-age
children the "education explosion" as
it has been called has shaken the
existing educational systems, threaten¬
ing the soundest and giving rise to
demands for a reappraisal even of
those which have long proved their
worth.
An educational revolution is taking
place in these apparently stable coun¬
tries. Among other developments:
Primary school enrolments have in¬
creased at a normal rate, following
an increase in the birth rate and the
raising of the school-leaving age;
Secondary school enrolments have
everywhere expanded considerably,
owing to the combined effects of three
factors: the birth-rate increase; the
raising of the school-leaving age to 15
and even 16 years; and, above all, the
voluntary extension of schooling (see
tables on primary and secondary
school enrolment, page 31).
It has now become almost routine
for all children to go on from the
primary school to the first stage of
secondary education. Increasingly par¬
ents have the means and the desire
to keep their children at school for a
secondary education, since school-
leaving and technical training certifi- **
cates will give them a better start in /|
life. L

matters and is the author, with R.S. Moore,

immigrants from poorer and hungrier
lands; political leaders are imprisoned
for life for demanding that all races
should have the same political rights;
and even in the cities of the affluent
Western world the Negro ghettoes
burn, signalling to the world the blank
despair of their inhabitants.
The most striking instance of racism
in the world today is that of the sys¬
tem of Apartheid in South Africa.
Apartheid is not as some people may
still imagine a serious attempt to pro¬
vide equal though separate facilities
for all races. It is segregation carried
through by men with white skins to
their own advantage and to the disad¬
vantage of the black and coloured
populations.
Its viciousness lies not solely in the
fact that different "races" must live in
different areas, but far more in the fact
that the areas assigned -to the non-
White groups are the overcrowded
and eroded parts of the countryside.
Inevitably those assigned to living
there would face starvation unless
they went as migrants and transients
to seek work in the White areas. So
what the theory of Apartheid means
is this: that black men will work for
white so long as political power lies
where it does.
Such a system as this is the product
of conquest and of the monopoly of
political power by a conquering group.
The conquerors seize upon the fact of
skin colour in order to imply that the
inequality which they have created is
given by Nature, that it is the inevit¬
able consequence oí biological differ
ences,
God.
or even that it Is the will of
Such a political system could have
been established in many parts of the
colonial world, but the process of
decolonization set in train by the vic¬
tory of 1945 and assisted by United
Nations action succeeded in many
countries in opening equal opportun¬
ities to all. Hence today we see many
cases where those who govern a newly
independent country are the children
of peasants or of political prisoners.
But where White supremacy and
Apartheid prevail, coloured people
must either accept their inferior lot or
be condemned for life to an island pri¬
son. A similar future is inevitable in
other countries if their present politi¬

THE SHADOW OF RACISM (Continued)
Wiping out discrimination-
first step to exploding racist theories
24
based upon inequality of political rights
between races.
But racism and its social consequen¬
ces are evident not only in the former
colonial territories. They are an ever
present feature of the life of advanced
industrial countries. Increasingly in
some at least of these countries the
traditional political issues pale into
insignificance beside the problem of
racial inequality and men's attempt
to fight against it.
Inevitably in the post 1945 world,
with the advanced countries of Europe
and North America undergoing a
period of unparalleled economic pros¬
perity, immigrants have come to their
cities from the poorer countries, from
the rural areas and from the areas
where the old slave plantations were.
There is much evidence to suggest
that this migration has not represent¬
ed an uncontrolled and uncontrolla¬
ble flood, for the immigrants have
exercised their own immigration con¬
trol by going where the jobs are.
Nevertheless this is precisely how
this immigration has been perceived in
the countries concerned and they have
reacted by throwing up barriers either
to immigration itself or to full equality
of opportunity for the immigrant in
fields such as housing or employment.
Such barriers may not have an expli¬
citly racial form. They may affect all
newcomers. But there can be little
doubt that coloured people are most
affected by them and that the discrimi¬
nation involved is widely thought to be
based upon colour and race.
Hence what we see is the segre¬
gation of coloured people in squalid
lodging houses if not by themselves,
together with the down and outs and
outcasts of the host society, as well
as a denial of equal employment op¬
portunities so that the coloured unem¬
ployment rate is often several times
as high as that for the society as a
whole. Such trends as these are only
amplified as increasing technological
progress ensures that those who do
have good jobs are better housed and
better paid than they have ever been
before.
A majority in these circumstances
can fight for justice and equality
through the ballot box. For a minor¬
ity the problem is more difficult.
They may appeal to the courts, and
this they have sometimes done with
success. But where law is inade¬
quate in scope or too tardy in redres¬
sing grievances there seems to have
been no alternative open but riot, law¬
lessness, and civil disobedience.
In Europe's history the main themes
of political change have centred on
the struggle of classes, and Euro¬
peans, interpreting the politics of the
colonial world, have tended to see
there a retelling of their own story.
The most striking fact of the world
today is that colonial people and
coloured people reject these inter¬
pretations. They note that discrimina¬
tion and inequality are not the lot of
the employed classes as such, but spe-

cifically of the colonial and coloured
workers.
Less and less are they willing to
accept advice which tells them that
their problems are not racial ones or
that they should throw in their lot with
the international working class. In¬
stead they set alongside Europe's theo¬
ries of political change, of increasing
equality and welfare being achieved
through working class action, their own
theories of Black Power or the Colo¬
nial Revolution.
A number of recent writers have
seen the divisions which are arising
in the world in these terms. New divi¬
sions are opening up and new allian¬
ces are being formed. On a world
scale we have the sense of what Marx
saw within the nation state in the nine¬
teenth century: the division of men
into "two great warring camps". But
the camps are no longer the camps of
social and economic class. The "war"
which we face threatens to be a race
war.
In this headlong rush to disaster
those who oppose racism must
oppose it at its roots. They have, of
course, to expose its untruth and its
fallacy, but this of itself is not enough.
It is necessary to find ways of protect¬
ing people against discrimination and
it is necessary to understand the
social and psychological causes which
lead to false racial beliefs having the
wide acceptance which they do.
These are problems to which social
scientists as well as the United Nations
specialized agencies should be addres¬
sing themselves.
The declaration by biologists meet¬
ing under the auspices of Unesco
in Moscow in 1964 did much to ensure
that racist theories were denied any
kind of scientific support. The con¬
sensus amongst biologists is now per¬
fectly clear and it amounts to this:
the inequalities which we observe in
the world today do not arise from the
different genetic inheritance of men.
Men are not unequal because they
were born unequal. And this being
so, the justice or injustice of existing
inequalities is not a closed question.
It is a legitimate subject of political
debate.
In the fight against racism the Mos¬
cow declaration of the biologists
should be used to maximum effect.
Schools and the mass media can be
used to ensure that the facts about
the biology of race are known. Unfor¬
tunately they can also be used to
opposite effect as well and the prob¬
lem here is the one which always
faces those who hope for reform
through education. Who Is to edu¬
cate the educators? Clearly Unesco
must do whatever it can to see to it
that those who teach, either through
the schools or through the media, are
thoroughly educated.
Those who wish to secure justice
and the elimination of racist practice
cannot wait however until the whole
population is educated. Nor can they
await a universal "change of heart ".
It is precisely this notion, namely that
the ending of racism requires a univer¬
sal change of heart, which is used to
justify its continuance. So long as
there are people being deprived of a
fair opportunity in life, it should be the
duty of any government which truly
opposes racism, to use its power to
make law to prevent and to punish
all acts of a racist kind.
N
O ONE with any experien¬
ce of legislation against racial discri¬
mination imagines that it can be le¬
gislated out of existence. Most
usually the racist finds loopholes in
the law, or he proceeds to discriminate
on grounds which are not overtly racist
(e.g. he argues that the deprived group
is uneducated or has unacceptable cul¬
tural standards). Nonetheless law it¬
self has an educative role and the
effect of only a few court cases on
public opinion, especially among those
who have no strong racist views, can
be considerable.
It is precisely where law fails that
the deprived and underprivileged are
likely to take the law into their own
hands. Urban riots and theories like
that of Black Power are, more than
anything else, assertions that the law
has failed in its responsibilities. The
end to violence and lawlessness can
lie only in the law doing what violence
claimed to do, namely to guarantee
the rights of the individual.
Finally, however, racism must be
fought not merely by protecting people
from the consequences of racist acts,
but by eliminating those social sit¬
uations which cause racism. For if
we fail to do this the likelihood is that
it will only re-emerge in a disguised
form. The real hope in the fight
against racism lies precisely in the
fact that something can be done to
deal with the problem at its roots.
There Is no evidence that racist
behaviour itself has any k'ind of here¬
ditary roots. It Is true that it is asso¬
ciated in its extreme form with patho¬
logical personality characteristics and
there is scope here for action by psy¬
chiatrists in eliminating it. But the
fact is that the majority of those who
are susceptible to racist propaganda
are not sick or disturbed people in
this sense. The main problem which
we have to face is how racism arises
in this group and how it can be stop¬
ped.
What sociologists have shown from
the time of Gunnar Myrdal's great
study of the American Negro onwards
is that once discrimination starts, the
man who is discriminated against is
in fact in an inferior position and that
this inferiority is used as proof of
racist theory.
The problem then is to nip racism
in the bud by eliminating discrimina¬
tion itself. Thus discrimination in
housing leads to the coloured man
living in inferior conditions. These
conditions are then used as a reason
for not allowing him to move into
better houses. The only answer to
this problem is to stop the discrimi¬
nation and by ensuring that all men
have adequate housing remove from
the public mind the ¡mage of the
coloured man as a natural slum
dweller.
If the social roots of racism are un¬
derstood in this way there will be less
chance of the development of new in¬
stances of political regimes based upon
theories of racial supremacy. This is
the task to which most of us must now
address ourselves, a defensive task
to prevent racism from winning new
victories. It is a task of mobilizing
understanding and goodwill wherever
we can find it, in unofficial as well as
in governmental quarters.
This is the least we can do. Not to
do it means that the world will drift
more and more towards the situation
of two great warring racial camps. But
if we can do it and, as it were, hold
the line where it Is, it may yet be pos¬
sible to go on to deal with the most
serious problems of all, to find the
means of dealing with those cases
where governments themselves are
racist beyond redemption and where
international sanctions have to be em- äi-
ployed to bring them into line with the ¿J)
moral standards of the twentieth cen¬

THE NEW FRONTIERS
OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
by Sean MacBride
T

HE Universal Declaration
is, and remains, the most important
instrument and landmark in the recent
history of mankind. It Is the Charter
of liberty of the oppressed and down¬
trodden. It defines the limits which
the all-mighty state machine should
not transgress in its dealings with
those whom it rules. And, from the
lawyer's point of view, most important
of all, it proclaims that the rights of
human beings "should be protected by
the Rule of Law".
The Universal Declaration is no
abstract statement of general prin¬
ciples; it is specific and detailed.
Many of Its provisions have now been
embodied in national constitutions and
have been used for purposes of judi¬
cial interpretation in different jurisdic¬
tions. It has received repeated con¬
firmation in numerous international
conventions. The unanimous decision
of the General Assembly to mark its
twentieth anniversary by the Interna¬
tional Year for Human Rights is in
SEAN MACBRIDE, of the Republic of Ire¬
land, is chairman of the International
Committee of Non-Governmental Organi¬
zations for Human Rights Year. An emi¬
nent international jurist, he was president
of the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe (1949-50) and has been
a sponsor and signatory of a number of
international treaties, including the Geneva
Convention for the Protection of War
Victims (1949) and the European Convention
of Human Rights (1950). He is a former
member of the Irish Parliament and was
Minister for External Affairs for Ireland
from 1948 to 1951. Since 1963 he has
been Secretary-General of the International
Commission of Jurists.
itself a positive act of confirmation of
its provisions.
Indeed, there is a growing view
among international lawyers that some
of Its provisions, which are justiciable,
now form part of "customary interna¬
tional law; this conforms with what
the often forgotten Hague Convention
of 1907 describes as:
"... the law of nations, derived from
the usages established among civilized
peoples, from the laws of humanity
and from the dictates of the public
conscience."
The Universal Declaration does now
represent In written form the basis for
the law of nations, the laws of huma¬
nity and the dictates of the public
conscience as accepted in the twen¬
tieth century.
A S is fitting, the United
Nations does not regard 1968 as being
merely an occasion for paying empty
lip-service in grandiloquent speeches
to the Universal Declaration or to the
achievements of the United Nations in
the field of Human Rights If the Inter¬
national Year for Human Rights is to
have any real meaning, it must be a
stock-taking of the extent to which the
principles enunciated by the Univer¬
sal Declaration are applied in practice
at the national, regional and interna¬
tional level. In this view all the
international non-governmental organ¬
izations involved in the field of human
rights, concur fully. Action in 1968,
and a programme for action in the
immediate future must emerge; new
targets must be shaped and new fron¬
tiers must be breached.
It is, of course, in the field of the
practical application of the provisions
of the Universal Declaration that the
efforts should be concentrated; what
we term implementation. In protecting
human rights, it is not sufficient to
enunciate the rights involved: it is
essential to provide a remedy readily
accessible to those affected. In curb¬
ing cruelty and crimes against human¬
ity it is not sufficient to deplore them;
it is essential to pass judgment and
if necessary outlaw the individuals
responsible.
At national level, first priority must
be given to the provision of domestic
judicial machinery to ensure the effect¬
ive protection of all the rights enun¬
ciated in the Universal Declaration;
such judicial protection to be effective
must be exercised by an independent
and objective judiciary not subject to
political pressures, and not the object
of political patronage.
However, experience unfortunately
has shown that purely domestic reme¬
dies are not always adequate. In
times of political turmoil or ideological
passion, governments, and even jud¬
ges, readily impose their views without
regard to the rights of the individual
or of minorities. With the continued
advance of technocracy bureaucrats
also, in many countries, tend to ride
roughshod over the rights of those
they dominate. For these reasons, it
has been found that international
supervision of the mechanism for the
protection of human rights is essential.

NEW FRONTIERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (Continued)
Has the time not come

national level and at universal level;
ideally, it should be provided at both.
At the regional international level,
the only valid system which exists so
far is that provided by the European
Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Free¬
doms. The adoption of analogous
Conventions in other regions Latin
America, Africa, Asia and Eastern
Europe has repeatedly been urged.
Interest is not lacking, and even drafts
exist, but progress has been slow;
one of the 1968 targets should be the
formulation and adoption of such
regional systems for the protection
of human rights.
At the universal level the progress
in regard to implementation machinery
has been also extremely slow and
disjointed. The International Conven¬
tion on the Elimination of Racial Dis¬
crimination and the International Cove¬
nants on Human Rights do contain
some form of implementation machi¬
nery. This implementation machinery
is far from satisfactory but it does
represent a step forward. However,
none of these instruments is in force;
they are still awaiting ratification by
a sufficient number of states to enable
them to come into operation.
findings would certainly carry far more
weight than those of transient and
often ill-equipped part-time U.N. com¬
mittees or sub-committees, selected
on a political basis.
T
28
HE great defect of the
present efforts of the United Nations
to provide implementation machinery
is that it is piecemeal and disjointed,
and political rather than judicial.
Effective implementation machinery
should be objective and automatic in
its operation; it should not be ad hoc
nor dependent on the political exped¬
iency of the moment; it should also
conform with established judicial
norms.
Has the time not come to envisage
the establishment of a Universal Court
of Human Rights analogous to the
European Court of Human Rights with
jurisdiction to pronounce on violations
of human rights? Even if initially its
judgments were to be only declaratory,
they would be of considerable moral
value and would help to create stan¬
dards in the field of human rights. Its
a»NE of the obvious immed¬
iate tasks upon which all efforts should
be concentrated is the ratification of all
United Nations conventions and cove¬
nants in the human rights field. In
many cases governments which have
supported, and even signed, interna¬
tional conventions have failed to ratify
them. Sometimes this is due to bu¬
reaucratic inertia ; sometimes to poli¬
tical feet-dragging by governments or
parliaments. Whatever the reason, a
special effort should be made in 1968
to secure the ratification of these in¬
ternational conventions. Some of these
have been under discussion for close
on twenty years; some of them have
been adopted unanimously by the
General Assembly.
One of the factors that influenced
the adoption of the Universal Decla¬
ration was the determination of world
leaders in 1948 to ensure that the
world should never again witness the
genocide, the destruction of human
rights and the brutality that engulfed
humanity in the neo-barbarism that
accompanied World War II.
Yet, twenty years later, humanity
is again witnessing in many areas acts
of brutality which disgrace the present
era. Such acts create a momentary
horror which shocks the human
conscience but are only too easily
relegated to the "lost property" com¬
partment of the public conscience.
Brutality is nearly always contagious.
In a conflict, it engenders counter-
brutality. The fact that cruelty is
tolerated and even easily forgotten
tends to encourage others to resort
to ¡t.
Cruelty is a contagious disease that
leads to a degradation of human
standards. This is a serious problem
which has grave ethical implications
that require the urgent attention of
Church leaders, statesmen, sociolo-

gists, philosophers and lawyers alike.
Would not the International Year for
Human Rights be a suitable occasion
to launch a campaign to arouse world
opinion against brutality? Article 5
of the Universal Declaration must be
given reality. This is a field in which
Unesco has done much; it is hoped
that in the future it will continue in¬
creasingly to devise ways and means
to minimize the brutalization of man¬
kind.
Most countries have laws making
acts of cruelty and brutality criminal
offences. Should not such acts also
be made offences under international
law? After all, international law does
operate successfully in such rela¬
tively less important fields as extra¬
dition, communications, crime detec¬
tion, commerce, shipping and consular
relations. Has the time not come for
the United Nations to create an inter¬
national jurisdiction to deal with crimes
against humanity?
For a start, violations of the United
Nations and the Red Cross Conven¬
tions could be made indictable
offences before an International Tri-

bunal to punish crimes against human¬
ity. Such a Tribunal could, in addi¬
tion, be given general power to pass
judgment on crimes that violate "...the
law of nations, the laws of humanity
and the dictates of the public cons¬
cience". Gradually, later, a code of
Crimes against Humanity could be
evolved and embodied in an interna¬
tional convention, but the Tribunal with
the jurisdiction indicated could be set
up now.
At the end of World War II a bold
new concept of international jurisdic¬
tion was adopted under the Charter
of the International Military Tribunal
that dealt with crimes against human¬
ity. Accepting the principle upon
which this new jurisdiction was found¬
ed, Sir Hersch Lauterpacht (in the 7th
edition of Oppenheim) rightly says
that:
"... it affirmed the existence of fun¬
damental Human Rights superior to
the law of the State and protected
by international criminal sanctions,
even if violated In pursuance of the
law of the State."
This jurisdiction suffered from one
major defect: it was a trial of the
vanquished by the victors. If this was
a defect, is there any good reason for
not creating now a permanent judicial
tribunal to deal with all crimes against
humanity? Such a permanent judicial
tribunal would not suffer from the
inherent defect of being set up on
an ad hoc basis to deal with a partic¬
ular situation.
T HE decisions of such a tri¬
bunal might remain temporarily un¬
enforceable in some regions. But be¬
hind every act of cruelty there is an
individual who perpetrates or inspires
the act of cruelty. That individual
could at least be identified and brand¬
ed as an international outlaw. Such a
sanction would have a restraining
influence and would reduce the trend
towards the brutalization of mankind.
It is true that the creation of a
Universal Court of Human Rights or
of a criminal jurisdiction to deal with
crimes against Humanity would involve
an acceptance of some degree of
supra-national jurisdiction: the extent
of such acceptance could be regulated
by optional clauses.
In the world in which we live, the
old outworn concepts of "absolute
leave and licence" to rulers to act
as they wish without regard to the
rights of the human beings over whom
they rule cannot subsist. This concept
of "absolute leave and licence" is in
fact what governments glibly encom¬
pass when they euphemistically refer
to "infringements of national sov¬
ereignty". Every convention, treaty or
even trade agreement involves a
limitation on absolute national sov¬
ereignty.
In this connexion it is noteworthy
that some of the very sovereignty-
conscious states of Europe have ag¬
reed to limit their absolute sovereignty
in the domain of human rights by
adhering to the European Convention
for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms. An even
greater limitation of national sov¬
ereignty has been accepted by the
States that compose the European
Economic Community, which many
other European states now are seek¬
ing to join.

NEW FRONTIERS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW (Continued)
Despotic regimes no longer immune
from impact of world opinion
30
International jurisdictions of the kind
suggested must be "automatic" that
is, must be free to act and be capable
of acting on receipt of a complaint
without the intervention of a govern¬
ment. This is one of the defects of
the European Convention in regard to
those States which have not subscrib¬
ed to Articles 25 (the right of indivi¬
dual petition) and 53 (the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court) of the Con¬
vention.
¡N any international juris¬
diction which is created, it is essential
that the individual aggrieved should
have the direct right of petition or com¬
plaint to the instances created. It is
important to ensure that a complaint
will not be stifled by a government or
be made dependent upon the prevail¬
ing political alignments.
Some of those governments which
still cling to the old outworn doctrine
of "absolute leave and licence" for
themselves argue that the individual
can never have rights under interna¬
tional law. This is quite erroneous;
this concept was abandoned after
World War I, when the Upper Silesian
Treaties specifically gave individuals
the right of petition. The European
Convention as well as the Interna¬
tional Convention on the Elimination of
Racial Discrimination and two Interna¬
tional Covenants on Human Rights all
recognize the right of individual peti¬
tion under international law.
The composition of any international
court or tribunal set up must be above
suspicion of bias. Its members
should as far as is possible be select¬
ed on a non-political basis; they should
not be merely functionaries of their
governments but should be jurists of
high standing who would command
respect.
Independently of any international
judicial implementation machinery,
there is at the moment a vitally impor¬
tant proposal for the establishment of
a United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights with a status in some
ways analogous to the High Commis¬
sioner for Refugees.
This proposal, if adopted, will pro¬
vide the United Nations with a modest
but useful instrument for the fulfil¬
ment of its mandate, under article
13 of the Charter, to assist "in the
realization of human rights and funda¬
mental freedoms for all".
One aspect of the proposal which
is of considerable importance is the
power the High Commissioner would
have to render assistance and services
to governments when requested to do
so. Governments, particularly of
newly independent states, are fre¬
quently faced with complex problems
affecting human rights in regard to
which they require advice and assist¬
ance. At the moment there is no
United Nations body to which they can
turn. The result has been that non¬
governmental organizations receive
requests from governments for assist¬
ance, but non-governmental organiz¬
ations are not the ideal bodies to
carry out this sort of mission; they
have not the necessary resources to
undertake this work; nor are they
always politically acceptable.
This is a function which would be
much better performed by a High
Commissioner appointed by the Gene¬
ral Assembly, with all the moral author¬
ity that he would have as represen¬
tative of the General Assembly. There
is a considerable field in which, for
lack of an appropriate United Nations
authority, the non-governmental organ¬
izations are the only bodies to take
an active interest. The appointment
of an independent and objective High
Commissioner would provide a United
Nations authority able to perform
some of the functions now being dis¬
charged by non-governmental organiz¬
ations.
Modest though it is, the proposal
for the institution of a U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights would
make a useful contribution to the pro¬
tection of human rights. It in no way
can be said to encroach upon national
sovereignty.
As six non-governmental organiz¬
ations concerned with human rights
issues recently pointed out in expres¬
sing their support:
"The functions proposed for the
High Commissioner fall short of those
which the undersigned international
organizations would wish to have
assigned to such an independent
Office. They do, however, appear to
represent the maximum likely to be
acceptable to a number of governments
in the present circumstances."
It would be a great pity if this pro¬
posal were not adopted at least in
1968; it has now been under active
consideration for three years.
While there is every reason to feel
despondent at the slow progress which
is being made in the protection of
human rights and at the increase in
brutality, this is no time for apathy
or cynicism. On the contrary, inform¬
ed public opinion in the world is now
more than ever before in a position to
make its voice heard. And world
public opinion is ahead of governments
in its desire to minimize brutality to
ensure the protection of human rights.
T HE advent of higher stand¬
ards of literacy and the availability of
mass media of communication have
given a new dimension to the important
role of world public opinion. No dictator
or authoritarian regime can now remain
immune from the impact of world
public opinion. There is no centre of
power, be it in a democratic state or
in a totalitarian regime, which now can
ignore world public opinion for long.
Indeed, it can be said that a shift is
taking place ¡n the centre of power
a shift that makes governments more
subject to world public opinion than
ever before. The importance of this
new factor is not yet fully appreciated
even by governments.
In this article I have concentrated
on the practical measures which
governments and the United Nations
might take to protect human rights
more effectively. I cannot conclude
without paying a special tribute to the
work of Unesco in this field. At the
educational and cultural levels which
are all-important Unesco has system¬
atically emphasized the importance of
the spiritual and cultural aspects . of
safeguarding the rights that are
inherent to human dignity. Indeed, if
today there is a better appreciation on
the part of world public opinion of the
importance of human rights, it is in no
small measure due to the foresight and
work of Unesco.

cess of changing. The flood from the
secondary schools is spreading to the
universities, a particularly alarming
development, since higher education is
just beginning to be reached by the
first wave of the increased birth rate
which began in 1945.
In our modern society dominated by
science and technology, an under¬
standing of science and a knowledge
of technology are keys to many im¬
portant posts. More and more young
women especially are entering univer¬
sities. In the faculties of arts and
pharmacology there are even more
women students than men, though men
are still in the majority in the faculties
of science, law and medicine. Finally,
students from abroad are swelling
university enrolment In many countries.
In 1964, for example, the U.K. had
15,000 students from overseas, France
had 35,600, the U S.S.R. 21,000 and the
U.S A. 82,000.
How do the students manage to pay
for bed, board and studies? Some live
on allowances from their families; but
more and more receive state grants
or take part-time jobs to support them¬
selves.

tion has benefited from the largest

'ONLY THE EDUCATED ARE FREE' (Continued)
Production-line' teaching

centage accorded education, whether
in terms of the total budget or in
relation to a country's gross national
product, is steadily Increasing.
Education and quality
Progress in making the Right to
Education an everyday reality has
everywhere been hampered by the
multitude of children for whom there
are no schools and teachers.
But in education, more than in any
other field, quantity is often the
totality of quality. Once a school has
been built and the children have
crowded into the classroom, the real
task begins not only to find a capable
teacher, but also to ensure that each
child is able to use his intelligence,
receptivity and determination to the
best advantage.
Article 26 of the Universal Declara¬
tion of Human Rights declares: "Edu¬
cation shall be directed to the fulj
development of the human personality."
By making education available to
the largest number of children, the
possibilities of creating a large and
active élite are immeasurably increas¬
ed. Providing, of course, that children
are given competent teachers, pleasant
classrooms, suitable textbooks and
equipment and are able to work
an atmosphere that is strict yet
laxed, serious yet cheerful.
in
re-
Each child must also be given the
opportunity to develop his capacity
for understanding, his curiosity, ¡magi-
nation and memory and his desire to
do well, with the patient help, friendly
encouragement and active guidance of
a good teacher. Whether one con¬
siders children in thousands or in mil¬
lions, the basic unit after all is the
group of 30 to 35 children under the
charge of a capable teacher.
Reality often falls short of this ideal.
Quantity too often leads to children
being handed over to unqualified
teachers. In Norway, 14 per cent of
primary teachers are unqualified and
the percentage In secondary schools
is even higher; in the Netherlands,
24 per cent of secondary school
teachers are without diplomas; half of
Israel's secondary teachers are un¬
qualified and only 300 to 350 teachers
graduate from university each year
instead of the 700 to 800 that are
needed; 15 per cent of the posts in
Bulgaria's schools are vacant, and
22 per cent of those in the technical
schools; Denmark has 20 per cent
fewer primary teachers than it needs
and is short of teachers in literature,
mathematics and physics; in Finland
only 6 per cent of primary teachers
are without diplomas, but 45 per cent
of secondary teachers are under-
qualified; in Spain many posts in
technical schools are vacant.
These are facts acknowledged by
governments themselves in their yearly
reports to the International Bureau of
Education in Geneva. The situation is
far worse in the developing countries.
It might well be said that only too
often helpless teachers are handed
over to the children.
The consequences are overcrowded
classes (40 children and upwards);
"production-line teaching" (one group
in the morning, another in the
afternoon); teaching methods which
condemn children to listen, assimilate
imitate, learn by rote and repeat.
Unless he has the makings of a genius
the individual child is submerged and
lost in this anonymous mass.
Nearly half the pupils in the primary
schools of the developing countries
drop out in the first or second years.
Scarcely one quarter of those who
start school complete the course.
What they learn is thus likely to be
quickly lost.
In the economically developed coun¬
tries the most harmful effects are a
lowering of the general level of educa¬
tion, too much repetition, classes
swollen by the children who stay an
extra year in the same grade, the over¬
burdening of children with work and,
far worse, the turning out of mal¬
adjusted children, mentally maladjusted
because their minds have been badly
trained and socially maladjusted be
cause they have become "rebels"
against their environment, and have
learned nothing that can be of use to
them in their adult life.
These evils extend to the top levels.
In the United States only one-quarter
of university students complete their
courses; in French universities only
one student in five obtains a degree.
Such are the results of sacrificing
quality to quantity unless energetic
measures are taken to find a remedy.
Quality and quantity can well go hand
in hand providing educators are vigil¬
ant and prepared to act in time.
And such action must be directed both
to the structure and content of
education.
Confronted with all these problems,
Unesco acts as a catalyst of creative
ideas. Open to the whole world,
understanding the needs of different
countries, Unesco is well placed to
note the genesis of such ideas, to
follow their evolution and at the appro¬
priate time to make them widely
known. It has already done so in
many ways, particularly with regard
to functional (^ literacy, educational
planning, continuing education for
adults, education for international
understanding and the status of
teachers.

SURVIVAL IN
THE NUCLEAR AGE
Sir,
I had never realized the gravity of
the threat that hangs over us until I
read Philip Noel-Baker's article (War
or Peace?, Aug.-Sept. 1967). Is our
education to blame? I am sure of it.
We are always hearing about the
atomic bomb, but not the facts that
would bring home to us the horror of
nuclear warfare.
Could not, indeed, "Survival in the
Nuclear Age" replace "The Wars of
the Roses" in the history syllabus of
secondary schools, as your article
suggested?
Is it considered shameful for us to
learn the true facts about a current
problem of far greater significance to
us than say "The Coronation of Char¬
lemagne"?

The answer is "Yes". The atomic
energy piled up in nuclear weapons
can be reverted and made useful for
peaceful purposes. Indeed, all nuclear
fuel at present stored in bombs, could
be transformed and used as fuel for
nuclear ships, nuclear power houses,
etc. Modifications would have to be
made in the nuclear fuel, but this
would entail only a relatively minimum
cost. An Issue of the Unesco Courier
on the peaceful uses of atomic energy
is planned for later this year Editor.
DISARMAMENT
IN THE TOYSHOP
Sir,
What about taking the .first steps to
disarmament in the shops that sell
children's toys?

SUPERIORITY COMPLEX
Sir,
The letters protesting against your
issue on Apartheid (March 1967) clear
ly show that you need to devote fur¬
ther time and effort to helping more
people view the problem clearly and
rationally. What surprises me is that
such racial superiority complexes
persist in the so-called civilized coun¬
tries (France, U K., etc ). Neverthe¬
less, the increasingly enlightened
public view of problems such as
Apartheid and War over the past
twenty years is an encouraging sign.

A PRACTICAL RESPONSE
Sir,
For Fascists, Nazis and other fana¬
tical "civilizers" to be outraged by
your issue on Apartheid is not unex¬
pected But when I read that one of
them is disgusted to the point of can¬
celling his subscription (Letters to the
Editor, June 1967), my immediate reac¬
tion is to take out another subscription
to the "Unesco Courier".

NO COMMENT!
Sir,
My daughter has received a sub¬
scription renewal form for the "Unesco
Courier". I wish you to know that I
have forbidden her to read your maga¬
zine since you published your infa¬
mously biased issue on Apartheid.
The only ideas it expressed were
those of a few exiled Negroes. What
about the viewpoints of the whites
who alone created the Republic of
South Africa and of the Negroes and
other non-white peoples who live on
good terms with the whites?
Your idea of art seems to be limited
to a blind admiration for the faltering,
groping efforts of primitive peoples
We are quite willing to help them to
become civilized, but we categorically
refuse to have the descendants of
cannibals held up to us as examples

SOUTH AFRICAN
STUDENT SCHOLARSHIP
Sir,
The problems of racialism in
Southern Africa are manifold and
complex, and will not be solved over
a short period. However, the students
of the University of East Anglia, U.K.,
have set up a fund, which they hope
will make an active contribution to
the efforts being made by a few
other student bodies in this country
by providing money for a scholarship
at this University for a non-European
student from South Africa
The scheme has the support of the
University Senate, who have agreed
to waive the student's fees and half
the cost of residence. We also have
contacts in South Africa, and a
system for the selection of the student.
Although the student body is still very
small, a fund has already begun, and
a good proportion of the money still
needed is expected to come from a
voluntary levy on students.
It is hoped that many people will
be interested in helping actively to
provide a University education in this
country for a non-European student.
We feel that there is a necessity for
a substantial pool of non-Europeans
with training and higher education in
South Africa, to which we would like
to contribute.
Contributions will be gratefully
received by the Treasurer, South
African Student Scholarship Appeal
Fund, c/o The Students' Union, The
University of East Anglia, Wilberforce
Road, Norwich, U K.

ODE TO A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
Sir,
I have occupied myself thoroughly
with the problem of "Man and Noise"
so particular thanks are due to you for
your issue on Noise Pollution (July
1967)
As an answer to Prof. Beranek's
article, which states: "The clip-clop of
horses and the rumbling of carriages
in an earlier day were quiet enough
to be romanticl" and that of Prof.
Lehmann ("Though we have no precise
information on the intensity of noise
in, say, a Roman city...") let me quote
the Roman poet Juvenal (born about
50 A D.) in a translation I found in
Roman Readings, edited by Michael
Grant (Pelican Book A 393)-
"Most sick men here die from m-
[somnia (of course
Their illness starts with food un¬
digested, clogging
The burning stomach) for in
[any rented room
Rest is impossible. It costs money
[to sleep in Rome
There is the root of the sickness.
[Movement of heavy waggons
Through narrow streets, the oaths
[of stalled cattle-drovers
Would break the sleep of a deaf
[man or a lazy walrus."
One may imagine the clatter of the
iron rimmed wheels on the cobbles
of the narrow streets and the insolent
drovers shouting without restraint, and
no police available to silence them and
no anti-noise law in force! You see,
the noise nuisance is already of long
standing!

Sulphuric acid
from the sky
About one million tons of sulphuric acid
are inundating Sweden annually, accord¬
ing to Prof. Sven Brohult, head of the
Swedish Academy of Engineering Scien¬
ces. Though much of this pollution comes
from smoke-stacks in Sweden, a great deal
is brought in from the British Isles . and
the big industrial centres in northern
France, Holland, Belgium and the Fed.
Rep. of Germany by westerly and south¬
west winds.
Newspapers
via satellite
Journalism history was made recently
when the front page of a London newspa¬
per was transmitted via satellite to San
Juan, Puerto Rico. During a transmission
lasting 15 minutes the page was received
as a film negative, from which a printing
plate was made. The method is likely
to be used increasingly in the future for
speeding newspaper distribution over long
distances.
World's oceanographers
expand joint research
Two major co-operative international
studies in the Mediterranean in 1969 and
in the Caribbean in 1970 have been adopt¬
ed by the Intergovernmental Océanographie
Commission, founded by Unesco. Among
other projects in an expanded programme
of océanographie research, the Commission
voted to take preparatory steps for a
global Ocean Station system to co-ordinate
and speed the collection of data.

This announcement cancels
the previous notice published in
our December issue.
Microbiology under
the microscope
Microbes play such universal and increas¬
ingly important roles in human life as
causers of disease, guinea pigs that give
insights into man, manufacturers and pro¬
cessors of food and drink, even as factors
in national development and in political
and economic decisions that Unesco's
reflective quarterly, "IMPACT of Science
on Society," has devoted an entire number
to these microscopic giants. (Vol. XVII,
N° 3, 1967).
"IMPACT" is published in English, French
and Spanish editions. Annual subscrip¬
tions: $3 50; 21/-; single copies: $1 00; 6/-.
Order through any bookseller or through
Unesco National Distributors (see inside
back cover).
World snow and ice census
Glaciologists are to make a global
survey of the quantity of snow and ice on
the surface of the earth as a contribution
to the International Hydrological Decade
(launched under Unesco's auspices in
1965). The president of the International
Commission on Snow and Ice, which is
supervising the survey, recently stated that
of the 1,360' million cubic kilometres of
water in all its forms on earth, only
35 million cubic kilometres consists of
fresh water, 80% in the form of ice or
snow.
'Flying squad' control
of traffic noise
Mobile police control of traffic noise
will begin on a trial basis in Sweden this
year. Noise meters compact enough to be
carried in police cars will first be used in
the big cities and later in all parts of the
country.
Flashes...
A New Unesco film, "Return to Flo¬
rence", pays tribute to experts and volun¬
teers from many nations who helped to
restore the city's art treasures damaged
in the flood of November 1966.
The Welsh United Nations Association
has commissioned Dr Alun Hodinott, a
Welsh composer, to write a Human Rights
Sonata. Its première will be at the 1968
Cardiff Music Festival.
M U.S. schoolchildren have raised enough
money in the past two years to build
150 two-room schools in 24 developing
