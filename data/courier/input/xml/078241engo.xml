Piazzetta di San Marco (detail)
Apart from the tall-masted sailing ships and people in the dress of byegone days, the celebrated
square of St. Mark, in Venice, looks today exactly as it did in the 18th century, when this scene
was painted by the Venetian artist Canaletto the Younger (Bernardo Bellotto, not to be confused
with his uncle, the great Canaletto, Giovanni Antonio Canale). On left, one of two ancient
columns of Egyptian granite which dominate the marble-paved Piazzetta di San Marco, leading
from the square of St. Mark to the sea. Column seen here is surmounted by a bronze winged
lion, emblem of St. Mark the Evangelist, patron of the city (close-up of lion is shown on front
cover). The painting hangs in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Pallazzo Corsini, Rome.

ITALY ¡s renowned not
only for the monuments and works of
art she has inherited from the peoples
and cultures of her historic past, but
also for the care she takes of them.
Authorities and individuals who, even
in normal times vie with one another
in caring for their country's art and
monuments, compel the admiration of
the world by the energy with which
they react whenever disaster strikes
their artistic heritage.
As the Italian Government is not in
the habit of appealing to others for
help in dealing with its own problems,
it must have considered the cir¬
cumstances to be truly exceptional,
when, on November 4, 1966, it asked
Unesco to appeal for international aid
for the relief of Florence and Venice,
victims of unprecedented floods.
Help did in fact come from all parts
of the world, enabling the cities to
overcome their immediate difficulties.
In Venice, however, it became clear
that the problems went beyond those
usually encountered in the restoration
and conservation of works of art, and
that the preservation of this ancient
city called for a special kind of co¬
operation. Why was this so?
One is tempted to reply simply that
Venice is unique, both in being a
microcosm of another age, paradoxi¬
cally surviving in our times, and
because of the profusion and richness
ALI VRIONI is Special Assistant to the
Director-General of Unesco. From 1961 to
1965, he was director of Unesco's Service of
Nubia Monuments, and from 1965 to 1967,
Director of Operations In the Department of
Culture.
of its art treasures. But is not this
more or less true, in all fairness, for
all great cultural centres, and can there
be any question of establishing a
hierarchy among them?
Consequently, it is not only because
of its aesthetic merits, nor because
of any sentimental leanings that the
national authorities and Unesco con¬
sider Venice to be exceptional: it is
because of the extreme complexity of
its situation.
In point of fact, the fate of Venice's
buildings and artistic heritage does not
depend solely on physical factors,
which, for the works of art to be
protected, would only have to be
modified by appropriate techniques.
A S is well known, the sur¬
vival of this heritage is threatened by
the storms which are causing more and
more flooding in the city; by the
currents which eat at the city's
foundations when they are too swift
and endanger its salubrity when they
are too slow; by the gradual and
apparently inexorable rise of the sea-
level, combined with the slow sub¬
sidence of the islands; by the micro¬
organisms which attack the wooden
piles on which the foundations are
laid (see article page 10); by humidity
and air pollution which eat into marble
and cause paintings to deteriorate.
But it is not a deserted city, in a
remote part of the world, that is
suffering from these ills. It is an
actively developing urban community
undergoing economic, social and
cultural changes which are, in many
respects, critical, and which in some
cases actually cause or at any rate
aggravate these troubles.
Technology is almost always able to
deal with problems when required to
do so by a healthy body in the process
of expansion. Experts are perfectly
capable of designing and constructing
dikes, sluices, meteorological warning
systems, systems for controlling the
flow of water in the canals and at the
entrances to the lagoons, for strength¬
ening the foundations, raising streets
and houses, protecting buildings and
their artistic treasures against damage
from air and water all things that
Venice needs urgently.
But in order to do this, it is essential
that the members of this community
should agree on the future they want
for the city and have the necessary
vitality to make such undertakings
possible.
Social and demographic studies
show, however, that the population of
the historic centre of Venice has been
steadily declining over the past
18 years, though factories and ultra-

STILL TIME TO SAVE VENICE (Continued)
The first full inventory of Venice's art treasures
modern harbour facilities have been
set up and are increasing in the part of
Venice situated on the mainland.
But this industrial expansion has not
so far led to any economic revival in
the historic centre. Some Venetians
indeed consider that it is detrimental
to the old town, and that the growth
of the new Venice threatens to destroy
the artistic and cultural values of the
old. Is this true?
No one can yet reply to this
question. One view is that the incom¬
patibility which some people see
between the modern spirit of industrial
enterprise and the old magic of Venice
is as real and irremediable as the
contrast between the factory chimneys
and cranes at Marghera and the
churches and ornamental façades that
give the islands in the lagoon their
poetry. If this is so, the Venetian
community will be split in two, and the
two parts will grow indifferent and
even hostile to one another.
The industrialization of the mainland,
which will proceed without being sub¬
jected in any way to the influence
of the traditional Venice we know,
will probably attract an increasing
proportion of the younger, more active
people from the historic centre. The
old city will find its intellectual and
spiritual life radically transformed, and
its possibilities of physical survival
affected: for it is not at all certain
that a city which has become a
museum, which is partially depopulated
and whose economic resources are
problematic, will be able to defend
itself against nature and the harmful
effects of human activity, as success¬
fully as a rapidly expanding city may.
The other answer is that economic
development is not a threat to Venice,
but its hope of salvation. The
inventive spirit, the knowledge, the
financial and technical resources that
it implies may be used to save the
Venetian heritage and generate a lively
upsurge of fresh ideas and initiative,
a new artistic movement in other
words, all the elements of the cultural
fertility that was for long the attraction
of Venice, and that may well return
(see article page 35).
The same big industrial and commer¬
cial concerns which are today digging
channels to make it easier for ships
to cross the lagoon, and which have
it in their power gradually to destroy
the beauty and atmosphere of Venice,
can, if they find it worthwhile, put
just as much imagination, energy and
money into protecting from floods and
damage by large-scale public works
and the regular maintenance of what
is to be kept from the past the noble
dwellings of the historic centre which
they could have chosen for their
impressive head offices.
Yc
OUNG people would no
doubt find life in an expanding city
attractive and would therefore be en¬
couraged to settle there and take part
in its activities, instead of leaving it
as they are doing at present. Provided,
of course, that they could live there:
economic and financial vitality, com¬
bined with appropriate legislative
measures, can assist in improving
residential zones and in providing
comfortable homes in an architectural
setting that has all the' charm of a
former age.
It is therefore probable that the fate
of the "historic monument" that is
Venice itself, and the art treasures
which enrich its chapels, salons and
narrow streets, will depend, in the last
resort, on the choice made between
these two opposing views.
But how will it be made? By
chance? By the luck of the draw?
When we consider the value of what
is at stake, would it not be more
worthy of our civilization that such a
decision should be taken well-
advisedly, on the basis of a sound and
thorough knowledge of the problems?
This is obviously the line that the
Italian authorities are following, by
setting up, among other things, various
national and local bodies to conduct
research, co-ordinate measures and
take action. And because the results
of this research are of interest to the
whole human race, which would lose
a dream if Venice were to perish,
Unesco has been asked to assist in
this long and complex task.
The first step taken by Unesco was
to make a systematic study of all the
work being carried out in Italy that
could throw light on the nature and
interrelationship of the problems, both
physical and human, which have arisen
in Venice. Out of this analysis and
reflection there emerged a voluminous
report, and, what is more significant,
a conviction the conviction that the
problems of Venice are so closely
linked one with the other, so totally
interdependent, that it is impossible
to understand one without knowing
the others, and impossible to solve one
without dealing with them all.
Experience has shown that satis¬
factory results in such circumstances
can be obtained only by using inter¬
disciplinary methods, and that to solve
the problems a comprehensive plan of
action is needed.
The possibility of carrying out such
a programme is in fact the problem of
Venice, whose technical problems
are only facets often deceptive in
appearance of this main difficulty.
Naturally enough, considering its

This remarkable map of Venice was engraved
in 1500 by Jacopo de Barbari. Displaying a
consummate sense of artistry, the engraver mingled
geographical detail and poetic fancy on the
six plates (each measuring no less than
27 by 33 inches) that make up this giant map
of the City of the Sea. Top of map, left, shows

aims and the means at its disposal,
Unesco has offered to help the Italian
Government in drawing up and
carrying out a plan for the preservation
and restoration of Venice; this was
decided by Unesco's Executive Board
at its meeting in Siena, on August 30,
1968.
But a lot more information is needed
before realistic plans can be made for
useful measures. For example, until
now there has been no complete
record of the historical monuments,
palaces and works of art. Unesco has
therefore assisted, in agreement with
the Italian Council for Antiquities and
Fine Arts, in compiling the necessary
inventories.
At the end of the first survey, some
16,000 index cards had been drawn up,
complete with photographs specifying
the state of preservation of each
work of art, the restoration required,
and what this would cost. A second
survey produced similar files relating
to palaces and religious buildings.
A third survey is in progress, on
housing conditions in the historic
centre and ways of improving them.
Another is dealing with the structure
of the Venetian metropolis in 1980 and
the problems of communication.
Finally, Unesco is preparing to put
its scientific services at the disposal
of the Italian authorities, in order to
reach a better understanding of the
hydrography of the lagoon, the sea
currents, the phenomena of soil
mechanics and hydrobiological in¬
fluences all of which are indis¬
pensable to any protective action.
If Venice were content merely to
study its problems and Unesco to join
in that study, irremediable catastrophes
might well occur before the scientists
had agreed on their causes. While
paying due attention to the need for
research and objective thinking,
Unesco is therefore principally con¬
cerned with taking practical measures.
Yet another example of the com¬
plexity of the problem of Venice is
that treatment must be started while
the laboratory analyses are still being
carried out. This undoubtedly pre¬
sents risks, but is it not often the
same when the patient is a human
being, whose breathing might stop at
any moment? The historic monuments,
statues and altars which are being
attacked by "stone disease," the
frescos which are disappearing, the
paintings which are losing their
colours, cannot wait either: and the
sooner the deserted palaces are lived
in once more, the better (see article
page 20).
Unesco's campaign is therefore
designed, from now on, to present
these problems to people and insti¬
tutions all over the world, who
do not wish to see Venice disappear.
Universities, foundations and large
business concerns can purchase or
rent a palace, restore it and use it to

house branches of their activities, thus
enjoying the incomparable setting that
Venice offers, and at the same time
helping to restore the city to its
original splendour. All people, even
those with little money at their
disposal, can share in saving the works
of art by sending their contributions,
however modest, to the special fund
opened by Unesco for the protection
of the Italian cities stricken by the
flood disaster of 1966.
Help is coming already from all
quarters: more and more . will be
received, and will become increasingly
effective, as plans for the protection
and cultural development of Venice
take form and are carried out.
Obviously the final decisions must
rest with the Italian authorities them¬
selves and Unesco can give only
limited assistance in devising plans and
carrying them out.
Nevertheless, this assistance does
not only involve Unesco's committees,
its experts and consultants and the
services of its secretariat. It brings
into play the many powerful inter¬
national associations, both govern¬
mental and non-governmental, with
which Unesco co-operates, and the
learned institutions upon which it can
call for help in short, all the means
of communication and co-ordination at
its disposal, not to mention those in
whose establishment it has been
specially concerned.
One such example is the committee
that the Italian Government and the
Director-General of Unesco agreed to
set up to advise on what should be
done to save Venice. Outstanding
figures from Italy and other countries
have agreed to .take part in its work,
so that the knowledge and wisdom of
the whole world may serve the
threatened city.
Venice may perish: not perhaps as
in the apocalyptic predictions that
some people like to make, by sinking
beneath the waves but, just as tragic¬
ally, by succumbing to the complex,
insidious, hidden ills which sap her
strength and energy.
But Venice may also survive. It is
possible to save her: Unesco would
not devote itself to a hopeless cause.
Venice can only be saved, however,
on one condition: that its rescue is
conceived as a collective task, a great
common venture requiring organization
and concerning everyone.
The Venetians first of all: those who
love ancient things, as well as those
who are concerned for the achieve¬
ments of tomorrow.
And the people of all other
countries too so that in these islands
far from their own frontiers, yet near
to them in spirit, they may continue to
find not only a sanctuary of the past,
but the outpost of a world which,
despite the disillusions of history,
seeks to be truly universal.

THE THOUSAND PARADOXES
OF VENICE
In this issue, the UNESCO COURIER presents the salient findings of a
comprehensive study on the problems of Venice recently completed by Unesco.
The study makes the first systematic assessment of the complex ensemble
of problems, physical and human, that face Venice today, and reviews the solutions
proposed by Italian specialists and other authorities. The article below describes
the struggle waged by the island city against the tides and currents eroding its
foundations, and a second article (page 35) examines the problems encountered
by Venice in its adaptation to the needs and demands of modern life. In a
third article inspired by the Unesco study (page 20) Louis Frédéric surveys
the ravages suffered by the city's unique heritage of art and monuments.
D ESPITE all her splendid
achievements, perhaps Venice's great¬
est triumph has been the ability to
survive. Even the facilities of her
lagoon, so advantageous to Venice,
were not a gift from nature. If the
ancient Venetians had not wrested it
from its natural course, the lagoon
would long ago have silted up and
leveled out to form a plain.
Its mirror-like waters, immortalized
by so many poets and painters, would
have long since given way to rising
land, and Venice herself would have
become another Aigues-Mortes (the
medieval French port now isolated
from the sea by marshland), if the
immense work carried out through the
centuries had not saved it from the
fate of other great lagoons, described
by Pliny, Strabo, Vitruvius and Livy,
which have disappeared along the
Adriatic coast, north of Ravenna.
The Venetians had to be exception¬
ally perceptive to calculate what
steps to take, and to avoid errors in
judgement or rash moves that would
allow the sea to take its revenge
on the haven they so tenaciously
defended against the fatally soft river
mud.
Of course, their ingenuity and
wisdom were not always as infallible
as their respectful descendants would
like to believe. Yet, despite the fact
that they have not been able to assure
their successors an entirely secure

genius of Venice, St. Mark's is the illustrious
symbol of the art and culture that flowered

seas and the link between East and West.

and was rebuilt in 1912.

domain, they have at least been able
to show them how to use their own
skills to turn nature's "bulldozer"
leveling power to their advantage.
The Venetian lagoon, formed from
an ancient sea marsh, is Italy's largest
inland sea water system. Shaped like
a shallow crescent running north-east
to south-west, it is approximately
55 kilometres long while its width
varies from 8 to 14 kilometres; its
total area, including all its islands, is
approximately 550 square kilometres.
This salt water lake is separated
from the open sea by a broken
offshore barrier, consisting of flat,
elongated islands and peninsulas of
glacial and alluvial origin, dating from
the Quaternary Period, and therefore
relatively recent and soft. The
hundreds of tiny islands dotted over
the lagoon are of the same origin and
substance: clay and sand.
The rivers which had helped to
form the lagoon might eventually have
filled it up with mud. In fact, they
did carry a profusion of rushes and
reeds to the populated islands,
which slowed down the currents and
hindered the free passage of boats.
The Anopheles mosquito thrived in
the river waters, spreading disease
which, in the 17th century, gradually
decimated the population of Torcello,
the "first Venice".
It is not at all surprising that one
of the main concerns of ancient Venice
was to protect herself from the
capacity of the rivers to spread
disease. People often said, forgetting
all that it owed them, that the lagoon
had three enemies: the land, the sea,
and man.
The formidable task of mastering
the rivers was not accomplished
without intellectual and physical diffi¬
culties. Experts disagreed on the
nature and urgency of both the
problem and its solution. Many
engineering works had to be
abandoned, dismantled or completely
remodelled, when they proved to have
a disastrous effect on some aspect of
the lagoon's economy.
But seen as a whole, in the
perspective of time, the Venetian
Republic's defensive system against
the rivers is nonetheless an im¬
pressive achievement. They succeed-

THE THOUSAND PARADOXES (Continued)
See-saw battle of sinking land and rising waters
ed in taming the Po and turning it
southward, as well as diverting the
Brenta, the Piave, and the Sile away
from the lagoon. And, although the
contermmazioni (trenches or canals
built on the outskirts of Venice) did
not prevent the areas nearest the sea
from gradually turning into marshland,
they did at least succeed in regulating
the salt content of the water, thus
eliminating malaria.
Some maintain that these measures,
necessary though they were, may have
been too radical, and have deprived
the lagoon bed of the supply of fluvial
sediment which would have com¬
pensated for the loss or settling of
its original alluvium, thereby speeding
up the subsidence process. A
secondary and less hypothetical result
of the diversion of the rivers is that
the bottom and banks of the lagoon
have become more exposed to the
effects of erosion by sea currents,
whose force is no longer absorbed by
a cushion of silt.
The Venetian lagoon is connected
to the open sea by three porti, or
channels, in the narrow off-shore sand
bar. From north to south, they are
the pgrti of the Lido, Malamocco and
Chioggia.
E
14
VEN before 1,000 A.D., the
Venetians were studying possible ways
of preventing the mouth of the Lido
channel from silting up. One of the
first steps was to close the channel
which existed at that time north of
the island of San Erasmo, while at
the same time, digging a new channel
to connect the basins of the northern
lagoon, the waters of which were
quite distinct. This made the Porto di
Lido the main entrance to the lagoon,
despite the ancient naval supremacy
of Malamocco, once the seat of the
Byzantine suzerainty.
Chioggia, the third porto, was
improved recently, as were the very
long parallel breakwaters, built under
the Austrian and Italian governments
to guide the tide through the three
porti, and protect them from silting up.
These channels have many advan¬
tages, one of which is to allow ships
access to the lagoon, enabling Venice
to continue to be an important
passenger and cargo port. But their
most important function is hydro-
dynamic: the purifying tides which
move through the porti twice a day,
assure that the Venetian lagoon
continues to be a living, dynamic part
of the sea.
Tides move in a vertical direction:
if the lagoon were an open bay, the
water would rise and fall along the
embankments of the city without
running through the rii, the city's
narrowest canals. Because it is
connected to the sea only through the
narrow bottlenecks of the porti, there
is a time lag between the level of
the lagoon and that of the sea. Here
we see the scientific principle of
communicating vessels at work one
of which is small (the lagoon) and the
other infinitely larger (the sea).
As the tide rises, the sea water
spreads horizontally inside the lagoon,
its movement helped or hindered by
such factors as the season, time of
day, direction and speed of wind, and
atmospheric pressure. The water
forms into currents at each porto,
which then flow across the lagoon
and through the channels between the
islands, until they reach the mainland.
The speed of the currents is deter¬
mined by the size of the lagoon basin
in relation to the size of the entrance.
The larger the basin, the faster the
current entering it; conversely, the
smaller the basin, or the greater the
proportion of land above water within
it, the slower the rate of flow. By
altering the size of the port/, this flow
can be corrected. Unlike its speed,
however, the height of the tide is
decided by lunar and meteorological
factors.
The latest measurements of the
tidal flow at the entrance to the Lido
channel show that its speed can be
as much as two metres per second.
Usually, it is not more than one metre
per second and naturally loses its
impetus as the current crosses the
lagoon, especially slowing down after
entering the maze of canals within the
city, and coming to a complete stand¬
still in some of the small rii.
As the tide goes out, the lagoon is
momentarily at a higher level than the
sea: its waters spill out into the open
sea through the same porti at about
the same speed and volume at which
they entered, six hours before.
IHIS ebb and flow of salt
water plays an essential rôle in the life
of Venice. It allows the lagoon and
the urban canals, at present the only
sewer system the city and the islands
have, to be cleaned, or "swept" (as the
ancient Venetians used to say.) And
its oxygen content is almost sufficient
to purify the water. In those interior
canals where the flow is strong, the
current carries away silt, keeping the
waterways open, but where it is weak,
they become blocked by silt deposits
which build up at the rate of seven
centimetres per year.
Obviously, the movement of the
lagoon - waters is not beneficial in
every respect. The same currents
that "sweep" the canals, eat into the
foundations of the buildings which line
them. Dramatic examples of the
damage that can result from this
insidious erosion occurred in June,
1950, and again in January, 1952, when
an entire wall of the ancient Fort of
Sanf Andrea and an abutment of the
San Nicolo bridge collapsed into the
waters of the canals near the mouth
of the Lido.
Moreover, in addition to the shores
of the islands, the currents erode the
porti themselves, gradually increasing
their size and allowing more water to
pass through them at greater speed,
a phenomenon that gives rise to other
dangers.
These currents, accused of being
much too weak when they are needed
to clean out sluggish canals, and of
being too strong and destructive in
other respects, constituted a problem
over which the Venetian Republic
laboured with great difficulty in its
search for satisfactory and permanent
solutions.
V.ENICE must certainly pay a
high price for the advantages of her
porti in calm weather. When the sea
and the winds beat against the city,
they leave the lagoon exposed to the
onslaught of the acqua alta, or "high
water" (a temporary but critical
increase in the level of the lagoon),
and prompt many a Venetian to wish
that it were completely cut off from
the seal But once fine weather
returns, they need only think of the
stagnant, fetid pond that it would
become, if it were not connected to
the sea, to be grateful for the regular
irrigation of the salt water which has
determined the rhythm of their life and
culture for 15 centuries.
It would be reasonable to suppose
that the waters which pour into the
lagoon at high tide through the narrow
gaps in the off-shore barrier would
blend together into one great body
of water, which would then ebb away
at random through one or other of the
entrances, i.e. the water that entered
at Malamocco would depart from
Chioggia, and vice versa. In fact,
such is not the case.
The waters sweep in through the
three porti at the same time, and
spread out into the lagoon at different
speeds. Although they draw close
together, they do not merge, each
staying within its invisible boundaries:
horizontal movement is theoretically
nil. As the tide ebbs, the waters
retreat back to the sea along their
same course, and leave the lagoon
through the same porti by which they
entered.
These "watersheds" divide the
lagoon into three basins of unequal
size. The northern (Lido) basin, which
contains the city itself, takes up
nearly- half the area of the lagoon.
The two others (Malamocco and
Chioggia) respectively account for
approximately 30 and 20 per cent of
the area, including land, water and
barene (islets and sand-banks, both

Below, Venice as depicted on a map made in 1534. Located on its
archipelago of islands in the centre of the lagoon, the city is
protected from the Adriatic only by a narrow cordon of islands and
peninsulas bisected by channels through which flow the tides that
clean and refresh the lagoon waters. Venice was formerly well
protected from the sea, but today its safety is dangerously
threatened by high water levels. Photo right shows the little
island of Burano, in the north-eastern part of the lagoon. Around
Burano spread the "barene", marshlands which the sea covers
at high tide, daily in certain places, from time to time in others.
Many of these marshes have now been drained and consolidated
to create new land for the development of industrial complexes.
above and below the water.) But the
dividing lines between these basins
are often temporarily shifted by winds
and other sources of instability.
Movement through the lagoon, both
for ships and sea currents, follows the
channels between the shoals created
by nature or dug by man. A look at
a hydrographie chart shows how many
there are and how tortuous are their
courses. Those which follow a
straight line, like the Vittono Eman-
uele III channel joining the western
end of the Giudecca Canal to Port
Marghera, are artificial and mostly of
recent construction.
A potential danger for the historic
city of Venice was created when large
oil tankers started to take this route,
via the Porto di Lido. It became clear
that a more suitable approach had to
be found for these cumbersome ships
whose cargoes could catch fire,
explode or leak out into the water.
In 1953, the maritime section of the
Ministry of Works proposed that a
new navigable channel be opened
between the Porto di Malamocco
(further away from the city), and the
industrial zone on the mainland.
This new channel is nearing
completion. Eighteen kilometres long
and 180 metres wide, it begins in the
open sea, five kilometres beyond
the lagoon, at a depth of 14.5 metres
below sea level, from where it slopes
up to 12.5 metres at Marghera: it will
allow ships of 65 thousand tons to
pass through to the oil port, and ships
of 40 thousand tons to the industrial
port. The channel project is part of
a programme of economic expansion
for reclaimed areas on the mainland.
Misgivings have been voiced about
what effects this interference with the
basic structure of the lagoon could
have on its hydrological conditions,
and ultimately its ecology (the inter¬
relation of living organisms and their
environments) and the security and
preservation of historic Venice itself.
According to experts from the
Netherlands, a new deep channel
between Malamocco and Marghera
will certainly make the tides in the
lagoon correspond more closely to
sea tides; Venice would be nearer
to the sea, so to speak, and there
would be less difference between the
high tide levels in the city and those
in the open sea.
An "Old Venetian" commenting on
the matter, said that he could see
other things besides advantages in
the prospect of the waves breaking
against the Doge's palace with the
same violence as they lashed the
embankments. Certain experts are
afraid that the freakish force of
the waters and their power to erode
the foundations of the city would only
be strengthened by such changes,
not to mention the probable increase
in the occurrence of "high water."
They also feel that the new currents
which are formed might gradually suck
away the original river mud in which
the piles of Venice are embedded, thus
making its buildings even more
unstable.
There are other experts who declare
that if the Malamocco tidal basin were
enlarged, the Lido basin would auto¬
matically become smaller, reducing
the force of the currents entering the
Lido channel, and making them less
erosive. But the capacity of these
currents to "sweep" and purify their
part of the lagoon and the canals of
Venice by renewing their water, would
also be reduced.
The choice between sacrificing the
city's salubrity to its solidity, or vice
versa, is a dilemma on which experts
have disagreed to the point of
questioning the fundamental data of
the problem. Some think that the
ground and the walls are firmer than
they are said to be, and that the main

thing is to promote the hydrodynamic
exchanges which can cleanse the
waters. Others consider that the
speed of the currents pose a threat so
serious that sooner or later, it will
cause Venice to collapse.
The pessimists also fear that the
changes in the hydrodynamic structure
of the lagoon, brought about by the
large-scale projects in progress, will
render Venice even more vulnerable
to "high water."
Located off the north-south mainland
shore are tiny islands caught in a
network of micro-canals; they are
covered by flowers which blossom
into lilacs in summer and autumn, and
provide a desolate haunt for sedentary
and migratory birds. Some of these
islands (the humid barene) are
submerged at high tide while others
(the dry barene) are permanently above
water, except at times of "high water."
This landscape is gradually giving
way to thermoelectric installations, oil
and chemical factories, harbour
facilities, residential districts, airports,
and agricultural areas, as new sections
of this "dead lagoon" are drained to
meet the requirements of economic
development.
Earth dredged from the deep Mala-
mocco-Marghera channel is brought
by pipeline, and used to create
1,200 hectares (almost 3,000 acres) of
solid land. Destined to become the
"Third Industrial Zone" of Venice-
Marghera, this new area will rise from
the lagoon bed to a height that will
assure its safety, even from the most
exceptional tides.
This industrial development and the
alterations to the lagoon's morphology
are not looked upon with favour by
those who, relying on the theories and
experience of past centuries, advocate
the preservation of the natural move¬
ment and equilibrium of the lagoon.
In fact, where the Venetian Republic
sought to protect the lagoon from
encroachment by the mainland, the
trend today is in the opposite direction.
The determination of the ancient
Venetians to preserve the barene, was
based on the belief that these
shallows, combined with the capillary
attraction of water to the mainland,
acted as a "regulating valve" in the
complex dynamics of the lagoon tides.
Today, the decrease in these natural
overspill areas is generally regarded
as one of the factors responsible for
the increasingly severe floods suffered
by Venice.
IHIS situation could de¬
teriorate even more if the Malamocco
currents their speed increased by the
depth and straightness of the new
channel are no longer absorbed by
the buffer zone of the barene, but
instead hit an earthbank which could
turn them back to the north, and
possibly direct their force on Venice.
Any increase in the proportion of
land to water (two examples are
Tronchetto, and other new islands,
and the Liberta Bridge, linking Venice
to the mainland), and even the
installation of fish preserves, might
compromise the security of Venice.
Altering the shape of the lagoon
would, of course, affect the movement
of the tides and their currents (about
which little is known even today), so
the reclamation of the barene poses
a definite problem.
The authorities responsible for the
monuments and historic buildings of
Venice have stressed that if more
marshy areas are dried out, the
preservation of the cultural heritage
of the city would be in potential
danger. They have asked the
appropriate ministries to re-examine
the implications both of the work in
progress and future projects.
The ancient defences earth and
stone embankments, palisades and
breakwaters which the Venetians
built to protect the eastern shores of
the coastal islands, did not stand up
for long against the repeated assaults
of the great waves. And what
remained of them were swept away
by the tidal waves of 1686 and 1891.
With their shore-lines their only
defence, these sentinels, comprising
from north to south the lido of
Cavallino, the islands of San Erasmo,
Vignole, Certosa and San Andrea, the
off-shore regions of the Lido and
Pellestrina, and the Lido of Sotto-
marina, became more and more vul¬
nerable as the waters ate into their
banks, and their populations increased.
To forestall the effects of the sea,
the Venetian engineers conceived the
Murazzi which, it was hopefully
claimed, would "last longer than
brass." The project was completed
WAVE-SMASHERS.
These massive
tetrahedral-shaped
blocks of concrete
are used to
reinforce the
bastions which
Venice has raised
against the sea.
Sunk along the
shores of the
Adriatic, they help
to break the force
of the waves and
tidal currents that
surge across the
lagoon and smash
against the
unprotected city
buildings.

in 1782, after 38 years of work (the
swan song of the republic, which only
15 years later would surrender its
sovereignty.)
Built of Istrian stone and consisting
of embankments, levees, and walls,
these dikes protect over four
kilometres of the shore of Pellestrina
and more than one kilometre of
Sottomarma's shore. They held firm
until 1825, when a tidal wave damaged
them.
They were repaired but during the
catastrophe of November 4, 1966, they
were breached in several places.
They are in the process of being
rebuilt according to improved plans,
and with the help of a government
credit of 9,000 million lire to the muni¬
cipality.
Another project that has been
approved calls for the construction of
sea defences on the islands in the
mouth of the Lido channel. The Lido
is not defended by the Murazzi.
Although its wide beaches ought to
help protect it, the sand is carried
away by the strong tides, and the
which once helped to replace
the sand have been greatly decreased
by man-made river embankments.
Other impediments , are the upper
breakwater of the Porto di Lido and
the lower breakwater of the Porto di
Chioggia, which stop sand from
drifting in from the north and the south.
Consequently, the beaches of the
Lido and Pellestrina "loosen up" more
each year and shrink, despite fresh
loads of sand brought in at great
expense by hotelkeepers. Even the
ground supporting the Murazzi may be
threatened eventually by subsidence,
due to this loss of sand.
In an effort to retain the sand, small
jetties perpendicular to the beaches,
called pennelli, have been built. The
same idea was unsuccessfully tried
centuries ago by the Venetian
>Republic; unfortunately its effec¬
tiveness does not seem to have
improved with time.
A FTER the Murazzi have
been rebuilt, the "sentinel islands"
protected, and the beaches streng¬
thened, it should be possible at least
to hope that the coast and the lagoon
will be safe for a time from the fierce
onslaughts of the sea, although it will
still be able to enter the lagoon through
the three port; of the Lido, Malamocco
and Chioggia.
The floods of November 4, 1966,
which damaged Venice and the
coastal islands, aroused the attention
and sympathy of the world, and the
concern of Unesco. Although a
dramatic catastrophe, it was not
unique; simply the most spectacular
example of a recurring phenomenon
the aqua alta, or "high water."
"High water" is caused by the
chance combination of lunar, meteor¬
ological, and hydrodynamic factors,
and its nature is fairly well known.
Less is known about what causes it.
The effects of "high water" are
increased by a permanent geophysical
condition which, although not unique
to Venice, takes on grave significance
in the lagoon: the gradual settling of
the lagoon bed, combined with the
world-wide rise of the sea level, is
causing the Venetian water level to
rise at the rate of three centimetres
every ten years.
If all the "high water" factors were
present at the same time, and at
maximum strength as could happen
any autumn or spring it has been
calculated that the level of the lagoon
would rise by 2.5 or even three
metres, and Venice would drown.
According to mathematical prob¬
ability, such a disaster could occur
only once every ten thousand years.
But a repeat of the November 4, 1966
flood, which submerged Venice for
24 hours under almost two metres
of salt water, oil and mud, could
happen every 250 years. And "high
water" with levels only 50 centimetres
less than that of the flood, can come
much more often: in fact, on
November 5, 1967, a year and a day
after the 1966 flood, such high water
conditions did occur, without making
much impression on public opinion.
Such calamities have always been
frequent in Venice's history. But
statistics show an extraordinary
increase in the number of heavy floods
in the last 25 years. None of the
aforementioned crisis factors, or even
the chronic condition which is causing
Venice to sink, can explain this
process. One theory is that the
recent work carried out in the lagoon,
which has led to changes in its
original structure, could be partly 1 |
responsible for this alarming develop- I '
ment.

THE THOUSAND PARADOXES (Continued)
The missing steps in Canaletto's paintings
nor is it a freak tide, nor even a
freak high tide: it is the result of the
more or less normal phenomenon of
the tide coming in on top of an
abnormal and exceptional rise in the
level of the sea.
However, this exception is enough
of a rule in Venice for the local
language to distinguish between a
normal, reasonable overflow from the
sea, and the "exceptional" high water
which exceeds the usual level and
sweeps through the traditional de¬
fences, invading the countryside and
flooding the ground floors of houses.
When . the flooding assumes cata¬
strophic proportions, the Venetians
ask many anxious questions about how
to preserve their city and culture.
According to scientists geogra¬
phers, oceanographers and meteor¬
ologists "high water" has numerous
causes, and they must all be present
to create a catastrophe.
This confluence of unfavourable
factors can only be attributed, in the
light of present knowledge, to the
hazards of nature: it is impossible, at
least for the present, to forecast when
it will occur. As knowledge of the
maritime, lagoon, lunar, atmospheric,
and hydrodynamic laws grows, it
should be possible to predict
dangerous levels of "high water"
several hours in advance and, with
the help of technology, avoid its more
harmful effects.
There is another phenomenon, which
in its relentless development, con¬
tributes to the insecurity of the inhab¬
itants of the Venetian coastal area.
It is caused by a general disturbance
of the world's seas in combination
with a specific disturbance of the
lagoon bed.
I
18
HE gradual rise in the
earth's temperature about one-tenth
of a degree centigrade per century is
causing a general increase in the level
of the world's seas. As the glacial
masses melt, the volume of the oceans
grows, and raises the sea level along
the coasts.
In Venice, the speed of this
increase has varied throughout the
years; at present, it is estimated to
rise 11 millimetres ever - ten years.
At the same' time, certain parts of the
Venetian lagoon are settling. Marine
tide-gauges show that the rise in the
level of the lagoon always exceeds
the readings taken elsewhere in the
world: in other words, the lagoon is
steadily sinking.
The readings have revealed that
in 53 years (1908-1961), the officially
measured sites had settled between
eight and 18 centimetres, depending
on where they were located.
Certain archaeological discoveries
point .to the possibility that the rate
of subsidence in Venice has recently
increased: old paving stones have
been found in the Piazza San Marco
which, in relation to the present
pavement, show an average subsid¬
ence of only about 11 to 12 centi¬
metres per century, instead of the
present 30 centimetres.
A study of the works of Venetian
landscape artists supports ' this evi¬
dence. In paintings by Canaletto and
Bellini, the number of steps showing
above the water in front of churches,
as well as the tide marks which they
reproduced as a greenish trace in the
mud on the walls, indicate an average
rate of subsidence of 12.5 centimetres
per century, when compared to the
present position of these marks.
I F, every ten years, the sea
rises about one centimetre and Venice
sinks by two centimetres, then the
water comes closer to the inhabitants
at the rate of about three centimetres
per decade, or more than 20 centi¬
metres during a normal lifetime. At
this speed, the buildings are sinking
one storey each thousand years.
Natural and artificial causes are
equally blamed for the subsidence of
the city and lagoon. The natural
causes include deep tectonic phenom¬
ena, and the settling of the alluvial
and marine deposits on which Venice
is built.
The artificial causes excite more
discussion, although there is a great
deal about them which we do not
know. The first cause concerns the
diversion of the rivers, blamed for
depriving Venice of new alluvial
deposits, which could offset the na¬
tural settling process.
The second cause involves the
excessive weight of the new build¬
ings, which may have accelerated the
settling process: ancient Venice was
built mostly of wood, but the pros¬
perous Republic was able to import
Istrian stone, marble, etc. This
"overweight" theory is reinforced by
the fact that Marghera, at the height
of its industrial development, settled
more quickly than San Marco, possibly
due to the heaviness of the factories
which were built there.
Excessive drainage of ground water
from under and around Venice is also
a possible cause of subsidence.
Water from artesian wells has always
supplied the city and the nearby
region. But now infinitely greater
quantities are being extracted to meet
the recent needs of industry on the
mainland.
Settling may have also been pro¬
voked by drilling for methane gas in
the Venice region. This possibility
is based on experience in the Po
valley where drilling for methane was
prohibited after the surface had sunk
in some places at the rate of 40 centi¬
metres per year. Similar situations
have occurred in the United States
and Japan.
The aqua alta has been a part of
Venetian life since its earliest history.
The ancient chroniclers bear witness
to the fact that no century was spared
its effects:
589 "We live neither on water nor
land", said the people of Venice,
quoted by Diácono in his Historia
Langobardorum.
circa 782 "There was so much
water that almost all the islands
were submerged".
875 "The water flooded the entire
city, penetrating the churches and
the houses".
1102 "Earthquake and heavy
flooding".
The floods of medieval Venice have
been more than matched by those of
recent times: in 1960, the water
reached a height of 1.45 metres; in
1966, 1.95 metres; in 1967, 1.45 metres.
Fifty-eight times in the last century,
the waters in Venice have flooded to
over one metre above their average
level. Of these 58 floods, 48 occurred
in the last 35 years, and 30 in the
last ten years, alone.
These almost chronic inundations,
which Venetians have been compelled
to accept as one of the less pictur¬
esque aspects of their city, are
definite cause for alarm, especially
because of their effects on the eco¬
nomic and social life of the city.
With the ground floors of houses
uninhabitable, constant dampness and
interrupted communications, Venetians
are gradually moving away from their
historic city. And they are not leaving
Venice for fear that they will be
drowned within the next ten thousand
years. They're simply tired of getting
their feet wet every day.

THE CITY OF TEN THOUSAND
by Louis Frédéric
V,_ ENICE is falling prey to the
harsh fate awaiting all old cities. It is
slowly dying of precisely those things
it gives life to. The past is being
sacrificed to the present to satisfy the
requirements of modern life. In place
of XVIth century Venice, the Venice
Sansovino knew with its orchards and
kitchen-gardens, Venice is already
little more than a heterogeneous
collection of lovely buildings, slums,
factories in other words, a mixture
of the sublime and the hideous.
Unless we are watchful, the
ceaseless struggle nature wages
against the works of men looks like
leaning in the former's favour and
depriving mankind soon of part of his
artistic and cultural heritage.
On a site that was unhealthy at the
outset' but admirably well-protected,
lying between sky and sea, arose' the
most harmonious artistic and archi¬
tectural entity in existence, even
though this underlying unity may not
be immediately apparent at all levels
to the hurried traveller.
There is a critical tradition which
complacently stresses the variety to
be found in Venetian architecture.
The fact that whole dynasties ' of
sculptors and builders, such as the
Bons or the Lombardis, linked their
genius- and combined . their craft
traditions when working in the white
stone of Istria or in marble, and that
certain complete units were left to
the care of a single creative genius
such as Sansovino, who designed the
Piazzetta di San Marco at the
beginning of the XVIth century is not
adequate to explain the profound unity
of Venice.

by time and the arts" and to identify
at a glance' nine centuries of archi¬
tecture to which all the regions of
Italy had contributed.
And, indeed, Venetian architecture
may be seen as being made up solely
of compromises, of an accumulation of
elements from the Italian, Arabic,
Byzantine, Gothic, Renaissance and
Baroque styles. But therein lies the
miracle; Venice as a .whole has
succeeded in reconciling the apparent
contradictions in these various styles.
The disparity, which is particularly
noticeable in the uneven lines of the
façades, vanishes in the overall
prevailing light and in the reflexions
of the canal waters that flow beside
palaces and houses; a rhythmic
repetition of a single theme which, in
terms of the city as a whole, restores
the unity which may not be found in
buildings taken singly.
This basic pattern, founded on three
constantly recurring elements the rio,
the ponte, and the calle (1) by
repeating itself over and over and
spreading concentrically out from the
original nucleus of the Rialto bridge,
has conditioned the shape of Venice,
and is further emphasized and made
more harmonious by restrictions on
the height of buildings. This pattern

element of water with the 180 canals
spanned by 378 bridges. Nowhere
else in the world is the marriage of
stone, sky and water so pronounced.
Whether you are entering the
Palazzo Ducale, the Ca d'Oro, a little
church or an old house, the impression
is the same, though naturally on
differing scales. One feels that if a
carving were missing from a façade,
a fresco from a church, or a balustrade
from a house, we should sorely feel
the loss, for the absence of a single
detail, however small, would destroy
that unity that delights us.
And the same applies to the interior
decoration, which goes, logically and
inevitably, hand in hand with the
outside, and is indispensable to the

artistic balance of the city. Inside we
have a series of frescos covering walls
and ceilings, stucco motifs along the
overhang of upper storeys, trompe-
I'ceil painting carrying on where stone
architecture leaves off, works of
Veronese at San Sebastiano, Tintoretto
at the Scuola di San Rocco, Tiepolo
at La Pietà and the Gesuati, religious
paintings as well as decorative friezes
all this is subordinate to the
architectural effect and, like it, has
a unity and coherence that springs
from its very diversity.
Spiritual heir to the San Marco
mosaics, the interior decoration of the
buildings has always retained some¬
thing of the ornamental role it had
played from the start. This goes back
to the rich splendour of the Venetian-
Byzantine style, with its brilliant
display of marble and gold, for the
Venetians held the view that painting
should be "above all decorative, a
thing for the eye, an expanse of colour
on the wall," as English novelist and
critic Walter Pater said.
This decoration emphasizes the
continuity in the overall look of Venice.
Even the pieces of interior decorative
art statues, easel-paintings, pyxes or
lecterns form an integral part of the
buildings to which centuries of
common history have indissolubly
associated them.
The Venetians have, from the earliest
times, been concerned with the moods
of the lagoon and the periodic
variations in the level of its waters.
However, as time passes, the cumu¬
lative effects of high water result
in increasingly great disasters with
each successive "flood." Sooner or
later, they are bound to affect the very
existence of Venice.
Humidity, which was further in¬
creased and became more penetrating
as a consequence of the "high water"
of November 4, 1966, is directly or
indirectly affecting all Venice's works
of art. In the church of San
Sebastiano, containing masterpieces of
Veronese, seepage has occurred
through the walls up to more than

twelve feet above the paving, as well
as in the church of the Terese.
The fate of works of art and the
future of architectural structures are
further threatened by the eroding
action of the canal waters which are
laying the foundations of buildings
bare and submitting the walls to slight
but continual vibrations. The living
organisms in the water eat away at
the piles: salt, which is a strong
corrosive, attacks all stonework and is
now gradually wearing down what
was once raised thanks to the pros¬
perity of the salt industry. Salt crusts
that form on the surface of façades,
of murals, and of easel-paintings, are
a constant worry to curators. But this
is not the only threat to Venice's art.
As in all modern cities, there is a
great deal of atmospheric pollution,
which causes "stone disease" and
affects pictures badly. We need only
reflect that each year, simply in
the nearby small industrial town
of Marghera, the quantity of fuel
burned releases over 15,000 tons of
concentrated sulphuric acid into the
atmosphere, from which it returns in
the form of rain.
Again, while the pigeons are one
of the attractions of the Piazza San
Marco, they are also a mortal danger
to the city's works of art. Without
mentioning the damage caused by their
droppings to façades and sculptures,
these droppings have throughout the
years accumulated dangerously in the
roof timbers of the palaces, whose
floors are sagging beneath the weight
of layers of guano inches thick. At
San Moise, whose roof was blown off
by the high winds that accompanied
the floods in November 1966, more
than ten hundredweight of droppings
were found on the back of Nicolo
Bambini's "Moses and the Eternal
Father" when the picture was taken
from the ceiling for restoration.
These are the more obvious kinds
of damage that anybody can see.
Although their importance should not
be underestimated, they should not
cause us to overlook a number of

WHEN

Venice at the peak of
its wealth and renown
could call on the
greatest artists to
embellish its palatial
buildings. Master
painters such as Titian,
Giorgone and Veronese
did not consider it
beneath them to
decorate the outside
walls of these noble
structures. But today
most of these outdoor
paintings are damaged
or completely effaced.
Atmospheric pollution
is increasingly
responsible for their
deterioration (15,000
tons of sulphuric acid
are showered over
Venice annually by
factories at nearby
Marghera). This 16th
century work by Titian
in the courtyard of the
Fondaco dei Tedeschi
was removed for
preservation in 1967.
Forty years earlier it
could have been saved

insidious, almost invisible even.
In Venice nothing is spared, not
even the bronze horses above the
central entrance of the basilica of San
Marco. We need only mention certain
names, representative of many other
similar cases of diseases affecting
the whole of Venice:
there are cracks in the Porta
dei Fion of the basilica and the
columns and capitals are liable to
collapse any day;
the Contarini column (XVIIth
century) on Murano is crumbling;
the Gothic sculptures of the
Frari are weathering as a result of
atmospheric corrosion and are dis¬
appearing beneath pigeon droppings;
mould is growing on the mural
paintings (by Fabio Canal) in the
church of San Martino di Castello;
the overhanging triptych and
the angels of the Tulho Lombardo
altar (late XVth century) and the
panelling in the chapels are falling
into decay;
the paintings displayed in church
sacristies are blackened and in a
pitiable state:
The San Canciano altar-place,
Giovanni Bellini's "Madonna" (1507),
the "Virgin Enthroned" by Negroponte
(c. 1450), the "Saint Nicolas in Glory"
at San Giovanni in Bragora (XVth
century), the "Scene from the Hebrew
Passover" by Pietro Malombra and
Antonio Vassilacchi (I'Aliense, XVth
century) at San Pietro di Castello, the
painted ceiling by Antonio Fumiani
(some thirty years' work, from 1680
to 1704) at San Pantaleone, the paint¬
ings of Veronese at the Palazzo
Trevisano, on Murano, those of Tie-
polo, the San Sebastiano frescos.
the monumental sculptures of
the Salute are liable to fall at any
moment (one broke away in 1966);
the Ca d'Oro, Santa Maria dei
Miracoli (late XVth century), the
church of the Terese...
And the list is far from complete:
there are more than. 10,000 mon¬
uments and works of art in Venice
classified as being of historic interest.
Each of these sets a problem of its
own sometimes several at once
which must be solved. Nowhere else
in the world is there such a high
concentration of masterpieces or
works characteristic of a particular
period or style.
Behind the mask of its charming
façades, Venice, when examined
closely, is severely disfigured. Cor¬
rosion and pollution which may either
have begun long ago (when the city
was founded in fact) or have started
recently, and now often progressing
at an alarming rate, are attacking the
city's walls and decorative elements.
The unfortunate thing about Venice
is that it contains all the conditions
bound to bring about rapid and ines¬
capable decay. Venice is gradually
subsiding into the mud of its lagoon.
Protected from the sea as it is, by
its offshore bars, this would not be
too serious: a thousand years from
now Venice would still be afloat.
But even so the hydrographical be¬
haviour of the lagoon must be
watched and not disturbed by breach¬
ing the bars without proper precaut¬
ions (as has already been done for the
improvement of the Malamocco
channel) and an attempt should be
made simultaneously to lower the
water level by erecting dams.
A, S regards structural decay
and the diseases of stone, the causes
have been scientifically identified and
the appropriate treatment is known.
We have learnt how to fight the for¬
midable "thiobacillus" and the nitri¬
fying bacteria, how to treat the
leprosy of marble and granite, how
to clean and protect paintings and
how to dry and restore frescos.
And yet in spite of that, each year
Venice loses 6 per cent of its marble
works, 5 per cent of its frescos, 3 per
cent of its canvas paintings and
2 per cent of its wood paintings.
This is an enormous proportion. At
this rate, in thirty years' time there
will remain barely half of what makes
present-day Venice a "peerless gem."
This does not include libraries, arch¬
ives and craft products or church
collections, which are disappearing at
a similar rate.
The preservation and restoration of
all Venice's works of art set many
problems for experts, whether archi¬
tects, hydrographers or town-planners.
Many works have already been saved
(canvases have been removed from
their supports, rolled and restored,
frescos have been dried, houses
consolidated, and so on) by the
Departments of Monuments and Fine
Arts. But there is still an immense
amount of work to be done: more
than 450 palaces or old houses, more
than 200 places of worship and
churches are in jeopardy.
Apart from the purely technical
aspects of saving this artistic and
cultural heritage, there are problems
of finance, expropriation, rehousing,
taxation, town-planning and admin¬
istration.
Venice, however, has no wish to
be merely a museum. Its population
is not made up solely of aesthetes
and museum curators. The needs of
modern life call for constant improve¬
ments in housing, in the setting up
of industries (to provide work for the
people and to keep the city alive),
in transport and communications.
This museum-city, the "città nobi-
lissima e singolare" of Sansovino,
does not wish to be behind the times.
There can be only one answer to the
proposed alternative of saving the
stones or saving the inhabitants:
Venice must remain true to itself and
develop without disowning its past.
Venice without its inhabitants would
no longer be Venice. Venice without
its monuments and its setting would
no longer be Venice. Neither alter¬
native is acceptable. But how can
its heritage be saved while respecting
the requirements of development?
This is the greatest and most impor¬
tant problem for Venice to overcome.
Looked at from a narrow viewpoint,
the problems that Venice has to face
might appear to be a painful accu¬
mulation of natural factors and of
human failings. Yet in fact they are
simply the result of the gradual evol¬
ution of an environment. Man's action
takes place against the background of
this evolution. To attempt to solve
these problems, all the elements of
Venetian life must be analyzed, and
the skills of specialists in all the
necessary branches be combined
with those of the Venetian experts.
But co-operation is not only of value
for the purposes of study and
research: it is also essential in
reaching decisions and in making use
of the resources made available.
Imagination will likewise be needed,
for new techniques will have to be
found: techniques to harness the
currents without letting the lagoon
silt up; to kill the micro-organisms in
the water without poisoning it; to
counteract the effects of storms
without disfiguring the city or the site;
to consolidate Venice without having
to demolish and then rebuild it; to
preserve it for dreamers without there¬
by losing touch with reality. This
will need something more than know¬
ledge or imagination it will require 0 |
positive genius. It would be too much '
to expect this from one man or even
from a single group of experts.

10,000 MASTERPIECES (Continued)
More than 4,000 square metres of the domes, vaults and walls of
St. Mark's Cathedral are covered by brilliant mosaics (see also
pages 10 and 11). Mosaics, some dating from the early 11th century,
are the dominating form of decoration throughout, picturing the story
of the Creation, the fall of man and the Redemption, the miracles of
Christ and the legends of the saints, all enshrined in a glowing
golden background.
Nor is it any use saving marbles
and frescos if they are condemned to
disappear beneath the waters; nor
building sluices without first setting
up a meteorological station able to
forecast squalls and to close the
gates; nor damming the approaches
to the lagoon without also building
sewers; nor reinforcing foundations if
walls are allowed to collapse; nor
improving the housing without provid¬
ing adequate communications; nor
building an underground railway sys¬
tem if nobody wants any longer to
come to Venice the Venetians be¬
cause they find the city uninhabitable
and old-fashioned, others because it
has been "over-renovated."
If the choice of measures is left
solely to curators, they would, no
doubt, consider it safer to turn the
historical centre into a museum, which
will mean the end of Venice, since
Venice, for those who love it, is not
a lifeless record of a vanished civiliz¬
ation but a place where they like to
come and live out their dreams. If,
on the other hand, the choice is left
to the technocrats, they will rely on
"decision theory" and choose the
most economically viable solution.
And they may not be too far wrong,
either, if it costs a fortune to build
dikes, and Venice does not have, or
is unable to raise the necessary
money. Loans are made only to the
rich. The ancient city of Venice must
be able to recover its former prosper¬
ity if is to avoid the risk of being
abandoned to its fate.
Modern constructions must not be
condemned, however sacrilegious they
are, if they bring prosperity to Venice.
Modem civilization is without doubt
disturbing the behaviour of the lagoon
itself, poisoning the water, filling the
air with smoke and spoiling the beauty
of the site. ' But it is also providing
the resources necessary to remedy
the very damage it causes, though
perhaps not in the immediate future,
or even perfectly. But the situation is
the same the whole world over.
Saving Venice means keeping it
intact for the happiness of the men
of our time, to ensure that the men
of the future can, in their turn, dream;
it does not mean relegating it to the
realm of mythology.

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS
OF TOMORROW
VE
ENICE is dying and not
only because the ground is sinking
and the sea rising, the trees decaying
and the frescos fading. The buildings,
too; are'slowly falling into ruin, exuding
the death smell of places long un¬
inhabited.
The insular situation that was once
the strength of Venice has become,
with time, a serious handicap. Over
the last two centuries the city has
gradually been deprived of its func¬
tions, first as a State capital, then
as the regional capital. While its
rivals in northern Italy were develop¬
ing with extraordinary speed, the
former Queen of the Adriatic seemed
to have missed the turning that led
to a modern economy, and to have
been immobilized within the confines
of an island grown too small. From
being a community of big land owners,
merchants and lawyers, it gradually
became a city of clerks and civil
servants.
Losing their importance in a world
where industrial production' is a prime
requisite, yet without becoming really
impoverished, the old aristocracy has
suffered, since the fall of the Republic
right up to the present day, from a
sense of having come down in the
world. Hence the temptation to
withdraw more and more, system¬
atically keeping up the traditions of
an illustrious past and rejecting
everything new.
"Venice," wrote Mary McCarthy,
"has always been a foster-mother to
the old." People might go to Venice
to die, but they die at an advanced
age. Titian was a hundred years old
at the time of his death, and even
then he succumbed only to the plague.
Even today, "it's a good place to
grow old in," say the senior citizens
of Venice, whose age it is impossible
to guess.
Venice's population statistics show
that, between ,1871 and 1951, the
In the last ten years the population of
Venice has dropped by 40,000. One
explanation for this exodus is that
Venetians "are fed up with getting their
feet wet every day" as a Unesco report
states. Left, pedestrians make their
way over a causeway of planks laid
across the flooded Square of St. Mark's.
population doubled. But it should be
noted that these figures refer to the
whole commune of Venice, which
includes not only the historic centre
and the islands of Murano and Burano,
but also the estuary and the mainland,
with Marghera and the old neigh¬
bouring communes attached to the
former Venetian Republic. During
this same period, while the population
of the mainland rose by 481 per cent,
and that of the Lido and Malamocco
by 654 per cent, the population of
the old historic centre rose only at
the modest annual rate of 1.2 per cent.
But from 1951 onwards the situation
altered completely. While the popu¬
lation of the mainland and the
estuary has continued to rise, that
of the islands is steadily falling. The
area comprising Venice proper and
the islands of Murano and Burano
shrank from 191,200 inhabitants in
1951 to 135,900 in 1966, representing
an average loss of 3,500 inhabitants
a year.
0
VER the last ten years the
total population of the commune has
increased by 31,000 while the old town
has lost nearly 40,000 inhabitants.
Were this loss of population to
continue at an average rate of
2,000 inhabitants a year, the old part
of Venice would have no more than
97,800 inhabitants by 1981in other
words it would have lost over half
its population in thirty years. There
would be more old people than
children and more women than men.
Forty-four per cent of those leaving
the city centre are under thirty and
71 per cent under forty-five. The
emigrants therefore come mainly from
the younger sections of the population.
The effects of the aging of a commu¬
nity on its economic capacities are
only too well known. The proportion
of inactive old people to those gain¬
fully employed was 13 per cent in
the island centre in 1951. Today it
has risen above 19 per cent.
Where do the Venetians go when
they leave the old city? Seventy-eight
per cent stay in the commune and
settle on the mainland or at the Lido.
Today in 1968 about two out of three
Venetians live outside the island
centre either on the mainland or on
the coast.
The number of jobs in the islands
has not decreased in the last fifteen
years. Whereas there has been a
falling off in employment in all bran¬
ches of the primary and secondary
occupations (agriculture, fishing, in¬
dustry and the building trade), the
tertiary sector (commerce and ser¬
vices) has increased in importance.
The most noticeable development has
been in the retail trade, the hotel
industry, banking and insurance, and
various types of services. This in¬
crease is due mainly to the develop¬
ment of the tourist industry.
More foreigners go to Venice in
July, August and September than
during all the other nine months put
together and this seasonal concen¬
tration necessarily has a prejudicial
effect on its economy.
Moreover, as is well known, Venice
has to contend with serious com¬
petition from neighbouring resorts. The
city has too few hotel rooms in
summer; more than half its hotels are
closed in winter. The improvement
of hotel accommodation obviously
depends on the flow of holiday makers
being spread over the whole year.
And it is unrealistic to hope that
investments will be made while the
hotels are full only three months in
the year.
Contrary to popular belief, the
tourist trade is not Venice's mam
source of income. Its traditional crafts,
and the activities of its commercial
port have an equally important place
in its economy.
At first glance, the development of
sea traffic gives no reason for
concern. But the prospects are not
very reassuring. For 1,000 years,
Venice has been one of the most
active ports in the world. But today
the port of Marghera, on the mainland,
is the principal industrial port. Where¬
as the capacity of the old city's port
is 1,800,000 tons, that of the new town
is 15,000,000 tons.
Half the economic activities of the
Venetian commune as a whole are
linked with port activities. In the old
city itself, the livelihood of 20 to
30 per cent of men with families
depends on jobs connected with the
port. If the future of the historic
centre as a port were to be endan¬
gered, its demographic and social ^_
future would surely suffer, for a very jh
large proportion of its population *'*'
would be affected by this economic
transformation. So it is understand-

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS OF TOMORROW (Continued)
Behind the lovely facadea mass exodus
able, that many Venetians choose
to make their living on the mainland.
As the number of jobs in the island
centre has increased since 1951, and
the number of "employable" people
has gone down, there are at present
more jobs in the city (about 12,000)
than there are people to fill them. It
is the first time in their history that
the islands have been short of
manpower.
It is not therefore because they
cannot find work that Venetians are
leaving their ancient home. Nor is
it because they earn less there than
elsewhere wages are higher in the
old town than on the mainland, which
is why Venice manages to bring in
from outside, every day, the 12,000
extra workers that it needs. The main
reason for the gradual depopulation
of Venice is the housing situation.
When the exodus began in 1951, it
was estimated that Venice needed
16,500 new dwellings, apart from the
renovation of existing buildings. In¬
stead, only 2,700 homes were built
between 1951 and 1961. In the
meantime, over 6,000 families, tired
of the conditions in which they were
living, left Venice.
While the rate at which habitations
were being put up grew steadily
slower, the depopulation of Venice
continued. Repairs and improvements
to old dwellings practically ground to
a halt.
By 1966, the situation was com¬
pletely reversed: only 40,000 families
remained in Venice, and there were
too many flats. Venice became, in
this respect, one of Italy's most
privileged cities. One would think that
people would be glad to live there
but they are not. For, compared with
the general European standard of
housing, Venice is definitely under¬
privileged.
A survey made in 1957 showed that
conditions were as deplorable as
regards both the structural repair of
the houses and their sanitation and
habitabihty. Sixty-six per cent of the
housing blocks required major repairs.
Nearly 40 per cent of the dwellings
were either uninhabitable or over¬
crowded. Seventy-five per cent of
the flats had no bathroom. Central
heating was practically non-existent,
and in 60 per cent of the dwellings the
kitchen was the only source of heat.
Besides all this, there were the
disadvantages of poor natural lighting,
dampness and the general incon¬
venience of the premises. Rents are
also higher than anywhere else in Italy,
and maintenance and repair services
are very costly because of the city's
communications problems and diffi¬
culties in transporting materials.
All this is not calculated to en¬
courage people to remain in the old
city. The young complain about the
lack of recreational facilities, when
the space for sports grounds could
easily be found. Venetians accepted
such living conditions for centuries,
because they were no worse than
elsewhere. But they are worse now,
since new towns have sprung up
everywhere and the discrepancy
between housing facilities in island
Venice and on the mainland has re¬
cently become greater. It is the
houses of Mestre and the Lido,
commonplace but comfortable, which
for fifteen years have been attracting
so many Venetians.
The basic problem, therefore, is
that of restoring, improving and mod¬
ernizing existing dwellings. It is not
enough merely to save the palaces
and mansions from destruction; it is
equally urgent to make the town

problems of Venice and
its people. According to
the special study made
by Unesco, 47 per cent
of Venice's buildings are
in need of repair,
16 per cent are gravely
dilapidated and 50 per
cent are damp-infested.
The renovation of
housing in Venice is an
urgent task, but the
cost will be enormous.

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS OF TOMORROW (Continued)
Building the new image of Venice
habitable, not only for its citizens,
but also for the visitors it is seeking
to attract.
For several centuries Venice has
been a weary city, but she has never
given up the struggle. The people
are used to seeking for ways and
means of making up for the loss of
traditional sources of income wherever
they are to be found.
Obliged to offer services which
could not be found elsewhere Venice
finally adopted, in 1917, a formula
which was then new to Italy: that of
the industrial port. The idea, to quote
the originator of the project, was "to
bring ships to the factory doors."
Instead of being, like a merchant
port, a place where goods are kept
in bond or in transit, the new port was
to be a vast complex of factories.
And so Marghera was created. This
new Venetian town was not built on
the mainland proper, but on 550 hec¬
tares of barene (sand-banks) rein¬
forced with soil from the lagoon bed
and raised to a height of some eight
feet above sea level. Factories were
being set up even before the port
was finished.
The pressure of expanding industry
soon forced Marghera to breaking
point, and a second industrial zone
was begun, now to be followed by a
third, much more ambitious than the
other two. The ground on which the
third zone will be built is still being
consolidated. The new industrial,
commercial and oil ports will not be
functioning fully until 1980. But there
are already 21 1 companies in Marghera
employing 40,000 workers.
HI AS the old town benefited
appreciably up to now from the pro¬
gress made by industry on the main¬
land? The increase of traffic in the
port does not affect it, as this consists
mainly of supplies for industry itself,
and of oil, the unearned increment on
which goes to foreign investors. The
municipal budget has derived hardly
any wealth from the mainland.
The new town costs the municipality
more than it brings in, and improve¬
ments needed to schools, the road
system, public transport and cultural
amenities would cost quite as much
as the restoration of the historic part
of the city.
As a result, Venetians on both sides
of the lagoon complain of having to
pay heavier taxes than the inhabitants'
of other large towns. The modern
town was to be a fine example of
town-planning. It is nothing of the
sort. The traffic jams and parking
problems in Mestre are enough to
make the inhabitants pine for the quiet
calli of historic Venice. Water and
electricity supplies and the drainage
system present problems as complex
as those of purifying the water of the
lagoon, and the mainland itself is
periodically threatened by floods. The
destiny of Venice is indeed difficult
to shake off!
Legislation has it that the islands
and the mainland form a single
commune. But the necessary inter¬
communication between the old city
and the mainland still has to be
established. The Venetians hardly
know where their city begins and
ends. When we speak of the
depopulation of Venice, we are not
thinking of the commune, since its
population is increasing; and when
the inhabitants of Venice go to live
in Mestre, they have the feeling of
moving, not to another district, but
to another town. The mainland is
another country, another way of life,
another society.
Business concerns recognize this
Banks, insurance companies and
department stores know they would
lose customers among the mainland
population (that is, two Venetians out
of three) if they did not open branches
in Mestre, pending the transfer of their
headquarters there.
It is not only the people on the
mainland who feel they belong to a
different world. Most of the Venetians
in the old town feel that the industrial
development of Marghera does not
concern them. The initiative of the
money, the organization and the staff
of this industrial complex come from
Milan, they say, and the products are
not sold in Venice to the Venetians
but in Milan to the Milanese. Nothing
can convince Venice that the develop¬
ment of the mainland will not in the
end continue independently of the old
city, and even at its expense.
However much goodwill they show,
Venice and the mainland are bound
to separate sooner or later, unless
the island centre really needs
Marghera, and vice versa.
Cities everywhere in the world are
trying to decentralize their activities
and divide up work among their
different districts, so as to solve
zoning problems. They all aim at
becoming "polycentric." Venice al¬
ready is.
Better housing and easier and faster
means of communication are what the
Venetians most often demand. Some
innovators have proposed various
solutions to the water-traffic problem-
"waterbugs" (silent, electric mini-
taxis), amphibious buses and hydro¬
foils; but the effect of the waves
set up by such powerful craft would
probably be disastrous for the city's
ancient buildings.
Land transport has been, and still
is, the subject of heated argument.
Some say that a new bridge must be

Problems of urban
communication and the high
cost of transporting building
materials are serious
obstacles to the upkeep of
buildings in Venice, which are
falling into disrepair (right,
portico of a house which has
tumbled into the San Severo
canal, now closed because of
such hazards). The
40,000 families who live in
Venice would like to see an
improvement in their housing
and also a modernization of
communications within their
city and with the mainland
(above, a boat follows the
twisting channels between the
marshy banks of the lagoon
which appear at low tide).
Plans are being studied for
an underground railway to
link the various parts of the
city and to connect with the
mainland (top left, model of
the underground as it would
run beneath the Grand Canal).

VENICE
LINK BETWEEN
ORIENT & OCCIDENT
by Marcel Brion
of the Académie Française
On the façade of St.Mark's
Cathedral, four colossal
bronze horses (detail right)
stamp their hooves on a
platform overlooking the great
square. They have reached
Venice after a long Odyssey.
Probably Greek in origin,
they once surmounted the
triumphal arch of Nero
and later that of Trajan in
Rome. They were taken to
Constantinople by the
Emperor Constantine in the
4th century and brought from
there to Venice by the Doge,
Enrico Dándolo, in 1204.
Napoleon Bonaparte installed
them in Paris in 1797, and
in 1815 they were returned
to Venice.

THE GREAT DOGE LOREDAN. Several versions exist of this
famous portrait of Leonardo Loredan (1438-1521), Doge of the
Republic of Venice. One painting hangs in the Museo Correr in
Venice; another in the Academia Carrara at Bergamo; a third in the
Dresden Art Gallery; and a fourth in the Museum of San Francisco,
U.S.A. Painted in 1501, the work has been attributed to Carpaccio
or to Giovanni Bellini. But there can be no doubt that it was
painted by a great Venetian artist.
iT the time when the Huns,
following their unsuccessful attempt
to invade China, were turning their
predatory ambitions westward, abrupt
and violent movements of peoples .
occurred, setting off what is known in
German as the "Volkerwanderungen",
the Great Migrations.
From Central Asia to the Danube
and the Rhine, Teutons and Slavs,
retreating in confusion before the on¬
slaught of the Huns, drove one another
from the lands of their ancestors
and, drawn by the fascination of the
South which has always stirred Nor¬
dic peoples, crossed the great river
barriers and made their way down to
France and Italy.
The shores of the Adriatic and the
hinterland, which was linked to them
politically and economically, were
inhabited by the Veneti, who had
begun to take advantage of their easy
access to the sea by fitting out small
fleets of merchant vessels, and when
necessary, of warships.
When they were overtaken by the
influx of migrating Teutonic and Slav
tribes, who had been driven from their
homelands by the Huns, the Veneti
found that their best hope of safety lay
in retreating to the thickly-scattered
islands in the lagoon formed by the
delta of the Po.

MARCEL BRION, member of the Académie
Française and art historian, has written autho¬
ritative works on the Italian Renaissance and
German romanticism. His work "La Résurrec¬
tion des Villes Mortes" (Ed. Pion, Pans,
1959), translated into most European languages,
:s considered one of the great classics of
archaeology. Its English edition, "The World
of Archaeology,", was published by Elek,
London (two volumes, 1962), and by Mac-
Millan, New York (1962). Other works by
Marcel Brion in English translation, are :
"Romantic Art" (Thames and Hudson, London,

LINK BETWEEN ORIENT AND OCCIDENT (Continued)
City of mariners, traders and artists
wedded to the sea
The ship carrying St. Mark
the Evangelist reaches Venice,
depicted as two,, tiny islands
with four trees in this 12th
century Byzantine mosaic from
the Cathedral of St. Mark.
Down the centuries the master
glass-makers of Venice have
won renown for the technical
and artistic perfection of their
work. In 1292, owing to the
danger of fire, the glass furnaces
in the Rialto district were
removed to the island of Murano,
still a flourishing centre of the
art today. This eleventh century
engraving shows a Venetian
craftsman blowing glass.
The "barbarians," excellent horse¬
men but not seafarers, out of their ele¬
ment when they were not in the
saddle, were forced to abandon the
pursuit and leave the Veneti at peace
in their island retreats. The lime¬
stone mountains walling in the hinter¬
land of the Venetian States had been
no obstacle to the hordes of Attila or
his Teutonic and Slav allies; but water
was an impassable barrier to peoples
who could neither build nor handle
boats.
Thus, secure from invasion in their
new homes on the islands of the
lagoon, the inhabitants of Aquileia,
Altinum, Concordia, and Heracleia
energetically developed a civilization
based originally on trade in salt
abundantly provided by the still waters
of the lagoon and on fishing.
New towns such as Torcello, which
had a population of 20,000 but flour¬
ished only for a brief period, and
Venice, smaller but destined to a glor¬
ious future, acquired economic im¬
portance from the advantages of being
situated on islands, free from trouble¬
some neighbours, and able to devote
themselves to trade at a time when
the major mainland States were contin¬
ually being shaken by serious politi¬
cal crises.
ISLAND civilizations born
and developing under such conditions
rapidly rise to prosperity and fame
which, because they are impregnable
to threats from any quarter, enable
them in turn to impose their pre¬
ponderant power and influence.
Crete, the centre of the great
Aegean civilization, acquired the mas¬
tery of the Mediterranean and impart¬
ed her culture to the peoples living
around it; England, never invaded
since the Battle of Hastings, when the
Normans established their footing on
English soil, early developed an imper¬
ial rôle; Venice became Queen of the
Adriatic in the early Middle Ages, first
with the consent of, and later in oppo¬
sition to, Byzantium.
All these are examples of what can
be achieved given the two balancing
factors of favourable geographical
"isolation" and considerable overseas
expansion by nations of bold sea¬
farers, astute traders, and statesmen
skilful both in using strong trading links
as a basis for building up the diploma
tic relations which help to stimulate
trade, and in using trade itself, with
the wealth it commands and confers,
to establish trading posts, open up
spheres of influence, and impose overt
or hidden forms of protectorate and
colonization on nations which earlier
had opened their doors to them
and become their trading partners.
Within the narrow limits of her archi¬
pelago, with its little islands linked by
bridges, Venice soon grew rich through
her self-conferred monopoly in salt.
Later she spread a network of sea-
routes throughout the Mediterranean,
conducting an active import-export
trade between the European States,
Africa, and Asia Minor.
E,VEN after she acquired
prosperity through the glass and silk
industries, her rôle remained essentially
that of an intermediary; she had agents
in Bruges, Antwerp, Amsterdam,
London, Bremen, Florence and Genoa;
she received manufactured goods from
France, Germany, the Low Countries
and England, and carried them to all
the Mediterranean ports, where her
merchants had special concessions
and even districts reserved for them,
enjoying privileges of self-government
and extraterritoriality.
Steadily pursuing this policy,
governed solely by considerations of
free and fruitful trade, Venice interven¬
ed in the quarrels of the Italian States
and their neighbours only so far as
necessary to prevent the free circula¬
tion of goods and money from being
impeded by wars, profitable only to
arms-makers and the condottieri, or
professional military captains, and pro¬
ducing catastrophic disturbances for
importers and exporters.
Her own overseas trading posts
were miniature Venices, forrrjing
enclaves in other countries, and the
Venetian Republic likewise placed at
the disposal of Turkish, Greek, and
German merchants trading near the
Rialto, buildings, known as fondachi,
from the Arab word fondouk, where
they had their dwellings, offices, and
warehouses, all free from local police
jurisdiction. The Greeks and Dalma¬
tians similarly had their scuole, or guild
halls in which to hold meetings, per¬
form their religious rites, and admin¬
ister the property of their trade-
guilds, which remained entirely inde¬
pendent.

The constant osmosis thus going on
between the Venetian Republic and the
European and oriental nations with
which she traded made Venice the
most cosmopolitan city in the world,
where every language could be heard
in banks and shops, and where any
traveller could walk about in his
national dress without surprising
anyone.
Art and culture also benefited from
the fruitful contributions lavishly be¬
stowed by foreign civilizations: first
Byzantium, which long dominated
Venice both aesthetically and politi¬
cally, then Pisan and French sculpture,
German, Dutch and Flemish painting,
with that piquant touch of the exotic
which was also to be found in Aegean
art at the period when the Sea Peoples
were settling in Egypt and the influ¬
ence of Crete was beginning to be
felt on the mainland at Argos and
Mycenae.
The symbolic "wedding of the sea",
renewed year by year by the Doge on
Ascension Day, significantly perpetu¬
ated this long-standing alliance, im¬
posed by geography, between the
great merchant city and the element
which favoured the movement of trade.
Casting his gold ring into the sea
from the gilded State barge, the
Bucentaur, the Doge would say, in
Latin, "Desponsamus te, Mare, in
Signum veri perpetuique dominii." (We
espouse thee, oh sea, in token of our
real and everlasting dominion.)
A S with everything subject
to the vicissitudes which affect the
lives of States, this everlasting do¬
minion over the sea, celebrated by the
yearly marriage, dwindled through the
centuries into a mere fiction. Increas¬
ingly frequent European wars severed
the trade relations between the Adriatic
and the northern countries; in Italy
itself, ports such as Genoa or Pisa
contested and tried to wrest from the
Venetian Republic her ancient hege¬
mony; pirates, fitting out whole fleets,
attacked and pillaged the squadrons
of Venetian merchantmen, in spite of
their convoying warships.
The growing power of Spain, France,
and the Holy Roman Empire gradually
eroded Venice's political prestige until
she no longer held her former place
of honour in the concert of great
powers. The French invasions cost
her the Romagna region, Apulia, and
the control of the southern Adriatic,
which passed to the Pope. She had
no territorial ambitions in Italy and
true to her trading interests, she inter¬
vened in European affairs only to keep

MARCO POLO
VENERATED
IN THE TEMPLE
OF THE 50 GENIUSES
Marco Polo's epic journey lasting 24 years, which took
him across the face of Asia and back again to Venice,
and the account he wrote of the kingdoms and marvels of
the East in "The Book of Ser Marco Polo" have won
for this enterprising Venetian a place in history as one of
the most illustrious travellers of all times. He left Venice
in 1271 and arrived back in 1295 (above, an impression
of Venice at that time), after making known in the heart
of China the renown and splendours of his native city.
Below right, an 18th century copy of an effigy of Marco Polo
venerated in "The Temple of the 50 Geniuses" in Canton
(China). The first printed edition of Marco Polo's book
was published in Nuremberg in 1477. Below left,

To thine own self be true...
open her mercantile communications by
land and sea.
One by one her Mediterranean pos¬
sessions slipped from her grasp during
the sixteenth and seventeenth cen¬
turies: the Morea region of Greece,
Cyprus, Crete and her other key island
possessions. Islam and Spain rerout¬
ed the trade in spices and other
oriental merchandise which had
brought wealth to Venice.
T.HE Portuguese were also
dangerous competitors, and it was
with the idea of resisting them that an
ingenious Venetian suggested to the
Senate that a canal might be cut
through the Isthmus of Suez to link
the Mediterranean directly with the
Red Sea and India, thus securing the
"route to the Indies" which in later
times was to be one of the major aims
of British policy. But, as a magistrate
sadly acknowledged at a meeting of
the Senate on July 5, 1610: "We have
lost all our trade, and the sea routes
of the western Mediterranean, and the
routes of the Levant are now used
only by a few companies, liable to
financial loss, short of ships, and
steadily growing weaker."
How was it that Venice, notwith¬
standing her political and commercial
decline, preserved her rôle as a great
international city, a focus of world
intellectual activity? At the risk of
appearing paradoxical, it must be
admitted that what saved Venice was
her carnival. The Venice carnival last¬
ed six months, from the first Sunday
in October until Lent. Unbridled plea¬
sure reigned, with disguises and masks
providing cover for every kind of
licence and extravagant behaviour.
When Voltaire describes the meet¬
ing, in a tavern, of exiled kings come to
Venice for the carnival, he gives a
farcical but true example of the extra¬
ordinary attraction exercised on the
whole of European society by a city
where pleasure was so easy to come
by and so benevolently authorized by
custom and law.
Taking part in the Venice carnival
had become almost a social obligation
for distinguished society; as also for
the less distinguished, and indeed
doubtful, company of adventurers of
every race and colour, who thronged
to Venice and under cover of the
mask, committed their misdeeds with
impunity.
There too were the charlatans,
magicians, esoterics and cabalists who
swarmed the capitals of all countries
in the eighteenth century. Represen¬
tatives of every nationality, including
turbaned Arabs and brightly robed
Moors, jostled each other in the gam¬
ing rooms, or ridotti, which were decor¬
ated with the utmost refinements of
splendour by the fashionable artists
of the Republic.
Foreigners in search of subtler
With the start of the 14th century, the genius and character of the arts which
had always been an Inherent part of and profoundly Influenced the life of
Venice flowered anew. The traditional association of Venice with the arts is
reflected in this detail of an 18th century painting by the great Canaletto
(Giovanni Antonio Canale). It depicts the crowds of Venetians who each year
flocked on Ascension Day to the Fair of St Roch, where artists displayed
the works they wished to sell.

entertainment found it at the theatre:
every evening there were performances
in seven theatres of opera, tragedy,
comic opera, and the commedia
dell'arte, plays without written lines
in which the actors showed dazzling
virtuosity in improvising new words
every time from a simple one-page
scenario posted in the wings.
Music lovers listened to sublime
concerts in the charitable institutions,
nicknamed "nightingales' cages,"where
orphan girls were brought up, being
taught to sing and play musical
instruments by the foremost masters
of the day. Out of doors one could
listen, as Goethe loved to do, to gon¬
doliers singing Tasso's poetry, taking
up the melody along the canals.
V.ENICE thus offered the
traveller an unending festival: in the
streets and squares there were fetes,
acrobats, mountebanks, minstrels,
trainers with their performing animals,
charlatans offering their wares; on the
canals, regattas were held, the first
competitor to arrive winning a purse of
gold and the last a young pig, and
there were processions of boats
decked out as mythological palaces.
The aristocrats and their noble
foreign guests gave exquisite con¬
certs for one another in the enchant¬
ing gardens of Murano, and balls in
their palaces, so sumptuously decorat¬
ed that Gustavus III, king of Sweden,
dazzled by their splendour, confessed
that such luxury was beyond him.
Eighteenth century Venice, whose
arsenals no longer employed more
than a few workers, and whose once
flourishing silk and glass industries
were almost dead, seemed, in this final
blaze of her old opulence, to be cele¬
brating for the last time her glory and
prosperity.
Fortunately Venice remains Venice,
that is to say a city unique for her
grace, beauty, and strangeness, the
silence of her canals, where the black
prows of gondolas thread their way,
the palaces resembling some fairy
construction in the Arabian Nights,
with the reflection of their dream-like
façades quivering in the water.
Around Venice still lies the garland
of islands of the lagoon: San Lazzaro
of the Armenians, where Byron lived
in an eastern monk's cell; Torcello,
now fever-ridden and deserted, its
gardens overlooked by its campanile,
which the Huns saw long ago rising
like a mirage from the sea; Murano,
where glass is heated and shaped in
the furnaces; Chioggia, where the red
and yellow sails of fishermen's barques
With its festivities,
concerts, theatrical
performances, and
particularly the
famous "Commedia
deirarte" whose
actors displayed an
astounding
virtuosity in
improvising their
lines, the Venice
Carnival was an
unending feast of
pleasure and
amusement,
attracting visitors
from many
countries. Beneath
this engraving
of 1610, depicting
actors "treading the
boards" in

the artist, Giacomo
Franco, has noted

and English.
painted with stars and pictures of the
saints, dance over the water; Burano,
where the magic bobbins click in the
deft hands of the lace-makers.
The incomparable charm of Venice
lies in the combination of all these
beauties and marvels, unrivalled by
any other city in the world, filling the
tourist with wonder and captivating the
art lover.
|N the Romantic period,
Venice became a peaceful retreat
where lovers came seeking conceal¬
ment, blissfully happy, or luxuriating in
despair. Venice used to be called a
dead city to render it still more ro¬
mantic and alluring. In reality it is a
bustling town, with countless ships
berthing, coming and going; where the
passers-by in the street have a quicker
and lighter step than anywhere else;
where there is tremendous intellec¬
tual activity; a town whose music fes¬
tivals attract the elite of music lovers
from all over the world, whose Film
Festival selects and awards prizes to
the best films from the five continents,
and whose Art Biennale has for almost
a century brought together, every two
years, the boldest and most outstand¬
ing works of painting, sculpture and
the decorative arts.
In this way Venice is perpetuating
her international calling, a calling
which goes back to the early Middle
Ages and which has been carried on
throughout the centuries in varying
forms that have always maintained the
same level of vitality and inspiration.
How can this vocation be followed in
the future? Venice should remain as
she now is, receptive to all new intel¬
lectual trends; but she should also
preserve the appearance and character
of a town which is unique the beauty
of her scenery and architecture, and
the picturesque quality of the life of
her streets, all cast their spell on the
sightseer.
She should not strive to modernize
herself; this would destroy the match¬
less harmony of the shell in which she
dwells, with its network of countless
canals; and it would obliterate that
wonderful unity of spiritual essence
and harmonious forms successive cen¬
turies have left intact Byzantine, Go¬
thic, Renaissance, Baroque, each in its
turn falling under the irresistible sway A»\
of the spirit of the place, which has
always been so happily wedded to
the spirit of the time.

PHILAE
AN APPEAL BY THE
DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO
NOVEMBER 6, 1968
46
E, years after the international
appeal launched on March 8, 1960, by my
distinguished predecessor, Mr. Vittorino Vero¬
nese, the Government of the United Arab
Republic and Unesco, on September 22, 1968,
solemnly inaugurated the reconstructed temples
of Abu Simbel on their new site in the heart
of the Nubian Desert. Removed block by block
from the sandstone cliff out of which they had
been carved, the temples had been raised more
than 180 feet and reassembled exactly as they
had stood in the past.
The success of this unparalleled enterprise,
which bears striking witness both to the extra¬
ordinary potentialities of modern technology
and to the effectiveness of international co¬
operation, should not blind us to the fact that
the Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia
is not yet finished.
Spectacular as the results already are,
success will not be complete until the temples
of Philae are also saved. It has been possible
to defer this operation until now because, owing
to their position between the old and new
Aswan Dams the final immersion of these tem¬
ples has so far been delayed. But work must
now go forward as quickly as possible.
On the basis of a study carried out by a
group of Egyptian consulting engineers and
architects, the Government of the United Arab
Republic has selected a project whereby the
temples will be dismantled, removed and
reconstructed on a nearby island. The work
will take four years and should start in the
spring of 1969. The operation will be partly
financed by the United Arab Republic, but to
guarantee its completion, Unesco must collect,
before the end of 1972, at least six million
dollars, representing about one-third of the
contributions made by the international com¬
munity to save Abu Simbel.
I cannot imagine that the member states of
Unesco, which have given such abundant proof
of their generosity, should fail, when so near
the goal, to make the final effort necessary
to save this wonderful group of monuments,
justly called "The Pearl of Egypt", from dis¬
appearing forever beneath the waters. Such
a failure would be all the more incomprehensible
to our own and future generations because the
temples of Philae are probably the best known
of all the Nubian monuments, and geographically
more accessible than many others for the
increasing number of visitors who will un¬
doubtedly be attracted to them.
It is therefore with confidence, and in
accordance with the unanimous wish expressed
by the General Conference of Unesco, that I
solemnly call upon governments, institutions and
foundations, both public and private, and upon
all men of good will to contribute, as the means
of each allow, to the success of the final stage
in a cultural undertaking whose high signi¬
ficance is obvious to the whole world.
May the intellectual and moral solidarity of
mankind, which it is Unesco's mission to
promote, be further strengthened on this
occasion in the saving of this precious treasure,
thus vindicating the worth of the human spirit
and advancing the cause of peace.

THE SURVIVAL
OF PHILAE
by Louis A. Christophe
"IHE Death of Philae," by the
French author, Pierre Loti, created a
sensation when it was published just
sixty years ago. Yet the noble monu¬
ments on this island in the Nile have
thus far escaped the death which Pierre
Loti predicted for them, although the
Aswan Dam downstream has 'been
raised on two occasions.
Moreover, the leprosy of salt de¬
posits which was eroding the löwer
foundations of the structures has long
since disappeared, washed away by
the waters which submerged the monu¬
ments after 1934, during nine months
LOUIS A. CHRISTOPHE, French Egyptologist,
is head of Unesco's Section of Nubia Monu¬
ments, and from 1960 to 1967 was Special
Representative of Unesco in Cairo for the
International Campaign to Save the Monu¬
ments of Nubia. He has written many stud¬
ies on Egyptology and is the author of a
fascinating book on the discovery of Abu
Simbel by the Swiss explorer Johann Burck-
hardt, entitled "Abou Simbel el l'Epopée de
sa Découverte" (Editions P F. Merckx, Brus-
sels, 1965).
of the year (see the "Unesco Courier,"
February 1960). And archaeologists,
artists and travellers who, until 1964,
braved the rigours of the Nubian sum¬
mer to land on Philae during the brief
period when it emerged from .the
waters, were stirred by the same emo¬
tions felt by their predecessors of the
19th century.
The harmonious ensemble of monu¬
ments whose massive forms of tradi¬
tional Pharaonic' architecture blend
with the elegance and grace of Grecian-
style colonnades, the diversity of
reliefs which transform the temples
into a colossal "library" on the reli¬
gion of ancient Egypt and particular-
_ ly the cult of the goddess Isis and
the sandstone blocks whose colour
changes with every shift and play of
the desert light, all helped to make
the visitor forget the losses that Philae
had suffered in modern times.
Few remembered that until the turn
of the century the inner walls of. the
sanctuaries were adorned with splen¬
did paintings, and that on the "Pearl
of Egypt," as Philae was known in
ancient times, long palm fronds rip¬
pled in the northern breeze, clumps
of tamarisk trees were filled with the
songs of birds, and swallows, beloved
by Isis, returned unfailingly each year
to their immemorial haunts.
But the annual spectacle of Philae
risen from the waters was seen by a
privileged few for whom neither the
overpowering heat of Aswan in August,
nor the slippery mud in July, neither
the deep and dangerous cracks in the
earth in September nor the awe-inspir¬
ing solitude of the abandoned island
were daunting obstacles. Far more
numerous were the visitors who came
in more clement months, when the
approaches to the First Cataract of the
Nile unexpectedly recall the vistas of
some mythical paradise.
To dream of Philae, the enchant¬
ress, and then to discover only the
mutilated reliefs on its monumental
pylons, or to search, often in vain, for

THE SURVIVAL OF PHILAE (Continued)
traces of the submerged colonnades
in the calm but cloudy waters is enough
to make one regret that the builders
of the Aswan Dam, and those who
twice increased its height, failed to
give the archaeologists of the Egyptian
Antiquities Service the opportunity to
rescue the island and its monuments.
A plan to save them had indeed been
drawn up, but could not be undertaken
through lack of national resources.
Then, in 1960, a great hope was
born. Specialists sent to Nubia by
Unesco in the autumn of 1959 to study
the problems of safeguarding its sites
and monuments, supported by a vast
wave of international solidarity, in¬
corporated the preservation of Philae's
monuments into the overall plan for
the Nubian campaign. And when the
Director-General of Unesco made his
solemn appeal on March 8, 1960, it
was Philae he had in mind, second
only to Abu Simbel, as a majestic en¬
semble to be saved by the Interna¬
tional Campaign he had just launched.
s,
52
UNCE the island of Philae
is located between the old and new
Aswan Dams, there was no need to
put a rescue operation into effect for
several years, which gave time to pre¬
pare the project (see the "Unesco
Courier," October 1961). A target date
was set for 1968, by which time it was
estimated that the High Dam would be
nearing completion and its turbines,
built to provide electricity for the in¬
dustrial development of the United
Arab Republic, would be in service.
These years of respite were use¬
fully devoted to the launching and
completion of a major operation in
Nubia the removal to safety of the
temples of Abu Simbel (see pages 52-
53) and to the study of projects for
the preservation of Philae.
In 1955, when plans were being
drawn up for the construction of the
High Dam, the Egyptian Antiquities
Department published a study entitled
"The Salvage of Philae." Its author,
Osman R. Rostem, proposed to isolate
Philae from the rest of the Aswan Lake
by a series of small dams or dikes.
This idea, put forward at a time when
the High Dam was still a theoretical
project, seemed perfectly feasible to
the Unesco specialists as an opera¬
tion that could be carried out in the
more or less distant future, since the
flooding of the High Dam would reduce
the water level at Philae in comparison
both with the former level of the Aswan
Lake and the waters of the High Dam.
Therefore a more elaborate study
of the Rostem proposal, commissioned
by the Government of the Netherlands,
was carried out by NEDECO, a Nether¬
lands firm of consulting engineers.
This proposed the construction of three
dikes between the right bank of the
Nile and the islands close to Philae,
thus creating a new lake in whose
centre the monuments of Philae would
stand in their original setting and
splendour. The level of this lake was
to be controlled by a pumping station.
But further studies showed that this
would be too costly, and an alternative
solution to carry away surplus water
via a drainage tunnel was proposed.
Though endorsed by the majority of
archaeologists and landscape archi¬
tects, since it preserved the monu¬
ments of Philae on their original site,
the Rostem-NEDECO project had cer¬
tain drawbacks. Some problems, such
as water seepage, could be solved;
other were likely to prove more diffi¬
cult. For example, might not the monu¬
ments in their hollow be isolated from
the wild landscape of the First Catar¬
act of the Nile by the high rectilinear
walls of the three dams? But the
main obstacle that remained was the
steadily rising cost of a project of
this type.
By 1965 the threat to Philae was
greater than ever before. It had been
decided that the hydro-electric power
station near the old Aswan Dam would
be used to supplement the turbines of
the High Dam. Thus, the water in the
lake between the two dams would
have to be kept at a sufficiently high
level and also raised and lowered by
from plus to minus three metres daily.
By now the foundations of the monu¬
ments were submerged throughout
the year, while some ten metres above
them the daily rise and fall of the
waters first submerged the sandstone
reliefs and then exposed them to the
open air, thus weakening their resis¬
tance to corrosion by the atmosphere.
IHE rescue of the monu¬
ments on Philae was thus becoming
more and more urgent and called for a
rapid decision. From new studies by a
group of consulting architects and en¬
gineers in Cairo came a second pro¬
ject, designed to take account of ar¬
chaeological requirements and finan¬
cial resources.
The new project proposed dis¬
mantling the monuments of Philae,
stone by stone, a method already used
to save most of the other threatened
monuments in Nubia, notably the
temple of Kalabsha, and reconstructing
them on the island of Agilkia, 300
metres downstream from Philae.
The operation would be carried out
as follows. First, the level of the
water around the temples would be
lowered to ground level long enough
to permit measurements and recordings
to be made, so that the monuments
could be reconstructed in their proper
symbolic orientation, each in correct
relation to the others and with every
architectural feature replaced exactly
as before.
To lower the water level around
the monuments for a long period would
obviously be impossible for economic
reasons. It would thus be necessary

THE FATE OF PHILAE
IN THE 20TH CENTURY
Before 1902
Taken just before the turn
of the century, this photograph shows
the site of the temples of Philae
high and dry above the First Cataract
of the Nile. The building of the
first Aswan Dam (1899-1902) created a
lake which flooded the island for
part of the year. The dam was later
raised on two occasions, between 1907
and 1912 (after which it was necessary
to tour the monuments by boat),
and again between 1929 and 1934,
when it inundated the temples for
nine months of the year.
The monuments suffered the irreparable
loss of their many-coloured frescos
which had survived intact for 2,000 years
down to the 19th century.
Before 1965
For thirty years (1934-1964),
Philae and its temples were engulfed
by the Nile from October to July.
Only the tips of the first pylon
of the Great Temple of Isis
were visible above the waters (right).
In July, after the opening of the sluices
of the first Aswan Dam,
the temples emerged in their entirety,
a magnificent spectacle (far right)
for those who braved the midsummer heat
During these three decades,
the water dangerously attacked and
weakened the sandstone, but the
monuments survived because their
foundations had been .consolidated
in 1900 by the Egyptian
Antiquities Service.
Today
The construction of the new
Aswan High Dam, upstream .from Philae,
will doom the "Pearl of Egypt"
to certain death unless efforts
are made to save it
The rise in the water level of the
Aswan Lake since 1965 now floods
the sanctuary of the goddess Isis
to about half its height, and the
foundations of Philae's monuments are
gradually being eroded by daily
fluctuations of up to six metres (19 ft.)
in the water level. Right, Philae in 1968.
It is now proposed to save Philae
by dismantling its temples
and re-erecting them on the island
of Agilkia, beyond the reach of the Nile.

THE SURVIVAL OF PHILAE
(Continued)

to build a coffer-dam around the prin¬
ciple monuments which could then be
safely dismantled. Other monuments,
of which only the lower foundations
remain, could be recovered by simpler
and less costly techniques.
While the blocks of stone (estimat¬
ed at between, 15,000 and 20,000) were
being moved to a storage area in the
plain of Chellal on the right bank of
the Nile, a new site for the monuments
would be prepared on the island of
Agilkia.
Far higher than Philae, Agilkia has
peak levels of 150 metres and thus
rises well above the level of the Aswan
lake. But to accommodate all the
temples in an area equivalent to their
former site, its pinkish granite surface
would need to be levelled and parts
of the island extended in width and
length by the addition of terraces

built up of rockfill covered with sand.
The final phase would be the re¬
construction of the temples, kiosks and
pylons on Agilkia, a task facilitated
by experience gained during similar
operations on several Nubian sites,
such as Kalabsha, Kertassi, Dakka and
Amada. The monuments would once
again stand in their respective places,
each facing in its original direction: the
temple of Isis looking south; the kiosk
of Trajan greeting visitors arriving from
the east bank of the Nile; the kiosk
of Nectanebo, those landing on the
southern shore of the island; and the
gate of Hadrian opening on the west.
But through its portals the vestiges
of the temple of Osiris will no longer
be visible. The temple will be left on
the island of Biga, a prey to the rise
and fall of the waters in the Aswan
lake.
The Government of the United Arab
Republic finally chose the project to
dismantle, transfer and reassemble the
monuments of Philae, in preference
to the Rostem-NEDECO project, for
financial reasons. The cost of trans¬
ferring the monuments is estimat¬
ed at 5,350,000 Egyptian pounds
($12,305,000) as compared to an
estimated cost of 6,450,000 Egyptian
pounds ($14,825,000) for preserving
them on their original site. Further¬
more, the proportion of hard currency
needed for the transfer project is only
40 per cent of the total as against
60 per cent for the project to build
dikes around the temples.
Work is scheduled to start in the
spring of 1969 and will take four years
to complete Early in 1973, the monu¬
ments of Philae, unchanged in every
respect, will have become the monu¬
ments of the "new" island of Agilkia.
Philae, engulfed by the Nile, will have
been irrevocably deprived of its crown
of buildings, and a shroud of river silt
will soon hide the wounds inflicted
by the tools of modern technology.
In compensation, the once desolate
island of Agilkia will have been garbed
in an array of sculptured stone and
its barren surface covered by kiosks,
colonnades, pylons and sanctuaries to
which the swallows of Isis will return
once more.
Tamarisk trees and palms may flour¬
ish again and beneath their shade,
throughout the year, visitors will try
to visualize the splendours of the festi¬
val in Greco-Roman Egypt, when the
shrine of the goddess, followed by a
cortege of her priests, musicians and
dancers, and acclaimed by the host
.of pilgrims, completed its journey on
the Nile and was restored, until the
next year's flood, to its chosen sanc¬
tuary.

VENICE AND THE VENETIANS
OF TOMORROW (Continued from page 38)

built to take the increasing traffic
between Venice and the mainland.
Others say, on the contrary, that all
road and rail links ought to be cut,
so that Venice may preserve its island
character.
Plans for a motorway which would
run the whole length of the old city
have already been turned down by the
authorities. Instead, it has been
proposed that an overhead railway
be built on pylons almost 100 feet
(about 30 metres) high, with some parts
of the track disappearing discreetly
underground. However, the pylons
would still mar the beauty of the
lagoon.
For aesthetic reasons, consideration
has been given to a possible system
of underground communications:
tunnels under certain canals, dup¬
licating bridges and ferry-crossings,
and, the most ambitious project of all
an underground railway linking the city
centre to the mainland, with a possible
extension to Padua and Treviso.
The Italian authorities have closely
studied this project. It would, of
course, take years to carry out, but
it would help to save Venice by
reducing the congestion of water
traffic, particularly on the Grand Canal
and the Rio Nuovo, and would, at the
same time, do away with the water
turbulence that threatens the city's
buildings.
An effort to restore to Venice the
kind of vitality it enjoyed at other
periods in its history, and which would
satisfy the demands of the modern
world, should not merely seek to
preserve its population by providing
up-to-date housing and commu¬
nications, or to develop its commerce
and industry. Such a Venice would no
longer be Venice.
Development everywhere is as much
a cultural as an economic and techno¬
logical problem. The cultural life of
Venice will be significant and command
respect only if it reflects a genuine
physical, economic and social vitality.
Cultural development must always
set the pace.
For centuries now, the University of
Venice has been situated in Padua.
However, a number of people actively
concerned with cultural development
want to make the old city of Venice
an international centre of higher
education.
Such a project would involve the
setting-up of a number of univer¬
sity institutions; faculties of social
sciences, arts, the history of art, mari¬
time studies, institutes of town
planning and architecture and an
international university of traditional
crafts. The Venice city council has
already adopted a scheme for sett¬
ing up an international Centre for
Engineering Sciences, which would
occupy the Palazzo Fortuny.
The idea would be to make Venice
a modern version of ancient Athens,
where students, research workers and
thinkers from all countries would find
a place for reflection, work and
discussion. It is with this in mind
that 500 students from universities in
Canada and the United States are
being invited to study in Venice in
1969. This movement ought to develop
and spread, but if it is to do so,
young people from all over the world
must find in Venice young people to
welcome them.
The Venice Biennale illustrates the
city's traditional concern with cultural
enrichment. As early as 1895, the
International Exhibition of Modern Art
was revealing avant-garde talent, as
well as organizing retrospective
exhibitions of painting and sculp¬
ture. Since then the Biennale has
expanded to include an impressive
programme of events: international
drama and film festivals, concerts and
so on. There is obvious scope for the
development of such programmes in
the future.
As for the tourist trade, who can
deny that Venice needs it? And yet,
Venetian students have angrily
denounced tourism as an evil. There
is undoubtedly a form of tourism which
is scarcely more profitable to Venice
than to the tourists themselves.
Hordes of tourists invade Venice each
summer and take away little more
than photographs of pigeons.
Cultural development plans would
therefore aim to change the image
of Venice, to enable the city to give
of its best to all its visitors and not
only to a few sophisticates or to the
"jet set" members of international
society who seek amusement at balls
and in the casinos.
The cultural development of Venice
as a factor in the preservation of this
irreplaceable city will fail unless full
advantage is taken of future promise
as well as past glories.
Nothing is as yet settled; everything
is still possible even that Mestre may
one day become the regional capital,
with Venice as a dying suburb. Then
perhaps the very people who fought
for this isolation, and who resisted
change, will leave it in their turn.
And the work of men who chose to
consider man a danger will be handed
over to the old enemies, salt and
water, which will inexorably gnaw
away at the city's already crumbling
stones.
This is what would happen if daring,
ambition, eagerness to move onwards
in a word, youth were to leave
Venice and settle on the mainland,
as if in a foreign country. It will not
happen if Venice remembers what she
has been for the last 1,000 years an
incomparable centre of culture, a city
invigorated by its lust for life and
confidence in the future.

Audible traffic lights
An acoustic signalling device designed
in Sweden helps the blind to distinguish
between "stop" and "cross" at pedestrian
crossings. When the light is red, the
device ticks at a frequency of 75 pulses a
minute which rises to 750 pulses when the
light turns green. The device is audible
nine metres away.
Teachers in knee pants
Chlld-to-chlld tutoring in some American
schools Is helping ease the serious short¬
age of teachers. The technique is new but
the theory is old and very sound, according
to some U.S. educators. They maintain
that the most effective teachers of children
are often other children, and that many
children who fail to learn from teachers
(or whose teachers fail to teach), learn
from each other.
Computers in the hospital
Staffs of several London hospitals will
soon be relieved of some of their routine
work by two new computer systems. At
King's College Hospital, a computer will
process admissions, nurse and bed allo¬
cation, drug and diet control and the analy¬
sis of laboratory and other tests. The
other computer will aid London's teaching
hospitals and two major hospital regions
by tackling one of the most varied and
complex payroll structures ever dealt with
by computer.
'Flying squad' control
of traffic noise
Mobile police control of traffic noise
will begin on a trial basis in Sweden next
year. Noise meters compact enough to be
carried in police cars will first be used in
the big cities and later in all parts of the
country. So far no decibel standards for
acceptable engine noise have been
established in Sweden, but a special
committee investigating traffic noise prob¬
lems is expected to recommend per¬
missible decibel figures.
Pakistan's targets
in education
By 1970, more than 13 million Pakistani
children will attend primary school, com¬
pared to just over five million in 1960.
The target for secondary enrolment in 1970
Is 2,800,000; in 1960, there were only
140,000 children in Pakistan's secondary
schools.
All about libraries
Unesco's programmes and current Inter¬
national developments in library, documen¬
tation and archives services are regularly
reported in the Unesco Bulletin for Libra¬
ries, now in its 22nd year. Topics for
1968 include: international standards for
hospital libraries, libraries and International
Year for Human Rights, abstracting prob¬
lems in developing countries, training
qualified staff, particularly in developing
countries, and audio-visual materials in
libraries. Subscribe through Unesco na¬
tional distributors (see page 59). Annual
rates (six Issues): $4, 24/-, 14 F, or equiv¬
alent in local currency.
Venezuela's farm schools
pay their way
Farm schools in Venezuela are self-
supporting, being financed through the sale
of farm produce raised on their land by
students. On leaving school, students
receive a loan of $1,200 which enables
them to farm plots with the help and
supervision of school staff members.
Flashes...
Unesco now has 125 member states,
following the recent entry of Barbados and
Mauritius.
Although the world will need 70 million
primary teachers by the year 2000, present
training facilities could produce only 20 mil¬
lion qualified teachers by that time, accord¬
ing to recent Unesco estimates.
World Bank loans of $17.2 million for
road improvements and $18 3 million for
railway modernization are expected to sti¬
mulate agriculture and industry in Colombia.
Recent estimates indicate that the Indian
Ocean Is "under-fished," and that annual
catches could be increased from 2 million
to 20 million tons without damaging stocks.
Mexico has become the first nation to
place its entire nuclear programme under
the supervision of the International Atomic
Energy Agency to ensure that the work is
entirely for peaceful purposes.
The golden rule
International Year for Human Rights
1968 marks the 20th anniversary of
the adoption and proclamation of the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights by the U.N. General Assembly
on December 10, 1948. The Decla¬
ration embodies ideals which have
been the inspiration of the faiths,
philosophies and laws of many
nations. Its expression of the,
common brotherhood of man has
been proclaimed in the sacred
writing of many faiths. The following
are a few such examples.
Christianity: All things whatsoever
ye would that men should do to you,
do ye even so to them : for this is
the Law and the Prophets. Matthew
7:12.
Judaism: What is hateful to you,
do not to your fellowmen. That is
the entire Law; all the rest is com¬
mentary. Talmud, Shabbat, 31a. '
Brahmanism: This is the sum of
duty; Do naught unto others which
would cause you pain if done to you.
Mahabharata. 5. 1517.
Buddhism: Hurt not others in ways
that you yourself would find hurtful.
Udana-Varga, 5, 18.
Confucianism: Surely it is the
maxim of loving-kindness; Do not
unto others that you would not have
them do unto you. Analects, 15. 23.
Islam: No one of you is a believer
until he desires for his brother that
which he desires for himself. Sunnah.
Taoism: Regard your neighbour's
gain as your own gain, and your
neighbour's loss as your own loss.
T'ai Shang Kan Ying P'ien.
Zoroastrianism: That nature alone
is good which refrains from doing
unto another whatsoever is not good
for itself. Dadistan-i-dinik, 94,5.

Letters to the Editor

PERILS OF DRUGS, DRINK...
Sir,
Congratulations on your special
Issue dealing with the abuse of drugs
(May, 1968). I attend meetings of a
group of former alcoholics, and among
them I have observed many of the
characteristic traits you describe in
your articles on drug addiction. I
would like, to see an issue of the
"Unesco Courier" devoted to the
problem of alcoholism.
Robert Dauteuil
Wissous, France
...AND TOBACCO
Sir.
In your Interesting issue, "Abuse of
Drugs", why was there no mention
of a drug that has done more harm
to human beings in the past five
centuries than all the hallucinogenic
drugs taken throughout history. In
France it claims as many victims as
road accidents; In Great Britain,
three times as many ; and in the
United States five times as many.
How was It that the beautiful Nico-
tiana Tabacum was not included
among the drug producing plants
whose pictures you published?
Few of us are personally acquainted
with addicts of opium or the hallucino¬
genic drugs, but we all know heavy
smokers whose vice causes them to
waste money and shorten their lives
by falling victim to the ills produced
by smoking : heart attacks, peptic
ulcers, bronchitis, emphysema and
lung and throat cancers.
Narcotics are not yet sold on every
street corner, but cigarettes are; while
costly publicity campaigns urge us
to smoke more and more,...
A. Sonnier
Nice, France
THE RIGHT TO
SELF-DETERMINATION
Sir,
The fact that certain people, of
whom one Is Jean Jordan (Letters to
the Editor, July-August 1968), are even
aware of the existence of publications
like the "Unesco Courier" is a
constant source of wonder to me.
Rather one would have thought its
readers would be from the forward-
thinking, humanistic sector of the
community. Surely the Important
issue at stake Is what is happening
now and why is it happening now?
The positive or negative aspects of
white colonialism In Africa or else¬
where have been but an obstacle to
each country's right and desire for
self-determination in Its own fashion.
Any advance of the human rights of
either individuals or nations can only
be commended; this is a world of
developing countries, on the equal
footing which provides the truest
basis for international understanding.
John Pulsford
University of Melbourne
Australia
UNESCO AND YOUTH
Sir,
The idea to make Unesco an
organization for youth, expressed by
its Director-General, Mr. René Maheu
("Unesco Courier", July-August 1968),
has come at the, right moment.
I spent part of this past summer
in an international work camp compos¬
ed of young people from twelve
nations, including Japan, Ghana, and
Czechoslovakia. We became fast
friends, working together, sweating in
the sun, joking, teaching each other
songs and phrases in our own
languages.
However, this solidarity, which
might be the basis of valuable co¬
operation in the future, is being
undermined in many international
meetings or is ignored by those who
officially represent their country
abroad.
Conny Arkenbout
Haarlem, the Netherlands
Sir,
Why not devote an issue to the
worldwide revolt among students and
workers? Even as an attempt to
resolve the conflict between the
generations this would be a worth¬
while enterprise. Show youth that the
ideal Unesco stands for is the ideal
of young people In all countries. Help
to restore, the confidence of parents
in the younger generation, since the
older generation is alarmed by youth's
attitude towards the civilization it will
one day inherit. Perhaps then Unesco
can hope to become the organization
of youth.
Jean Paul Le Roux
Señé, France
FIRST THINGS FIRST
Sir,
I am sorry but I don't agree to
Unesco's aid to archaeological re¬
storation (in search, amongst other
things, of "tourist development"), out¬
lined In your June 1968 Issue. Man
has no need to clutch at the past.
This money should go first and
foremost to alleviate problems of
hunger etc.
Richard Fairclough
Paris, France
THE WORLD YOUTH
HOPES FOR
Sir.
I imagine I am not alone In my
appreciation of the scope, idealism
and competence, of the prize-winning
essay from Uruguay on "The World
We Hope For" , written by Maria
Cristina Costa Diaz ("Unesco Cou¬
rier", February 1968). Now we should
like to see a symposium of extracts
from essays by similarly thoughtful
young people,, offering suggestions as
to how they think these ideals might
eventually be achieved. We older
folk have wanted this kind of world
for decades, but we have not been
able to be sufficiently creative and
adventurous in finding ways to put the
ideals into practice. We must be
ready to help and encourage, the
younger folk who have perhaps more
vision.
M. E. B. Johnson
London, U.K.
SLAUGHTER OF BABY SEALS
Sir.
I would urge you to use your
influence in Canada and in other
countries where young seals are being
massacred, to help put an end to
this revolting and shameful carnage.
The suffering of helpless animals is
perhaps even more horrible than that
of human beings, who at least can
defend themselves. An article in the
"Unesco Courier" would help to alert
people in all countries to this tragic
problem.
Sella Achedjian
Brussels, Belgium
'THE WAR GAME'
Sir,
The Unitarian Extension Movement
in Australia is gravely concerned at
the action of the British Broadcasting
Corporation in suppressing the tele¬
casting of "The War Game." a film
produced for the BBC and designed
to show the full Impact of nuclear
warfare.
The BBC action In allowing the film
to be shown only in cinemas and under
certain conditions has meant that the
bulk of the world population Is ef¬
fectively stopped from seeing It. This
situation is compounded by the fact
that the BBC will not allow the film
to be telecast anywhere in the world.
There is no doubt whatever that
the frequent telecasting of this film
would make millions of people through¬
out the world acutely conscious of
the dangers of nuclear war and
would therefore harden public attitudes
against any policies which may result
In a nuclear war breaking out.
The virtual suppression of this film
by the BBC may well have inhibited
something which could have profoundly
affected future attitudes to and an
awareness of this important question.
This would be a major tragedy.
