NEW TREATY TO COMBAT
ILLEGAL ART TRADE
A big step forward in the struggle against
art trafficking has been taken with the
adoption of a new international Convention
designed by the Rome-based International
Institute for the Unification of Private
Law (UNIDROIT). The Convention, which
was adopted on 24 June 1995, comple¬
ments UNESCO's 1970 Convention on the
Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the
Illicit Import, Export antl Transfer of
Ownership of Cultural Property. Whereas
the UNESCO Convention is applicable at
the intergovernmental level, the
UNIDROIT Convention is directed at the
art market. It requires, for example, art
dealers to enquire fully about an object's
past ownership and also fills a legal
vacuum which hindered the restitution of
stolen properties to their owners. The
Convention was approved by delegates
from 70 countries and will enter into force
6 months after ratification by 5 countries.
ECOTECHNOLOGIES FOR
TOMORROW
From 4 to 8 February 1996, UNESCO orga¬
nized an ecotechnology workshop in
Madras (India). Among the participants
were the American agricultural scientist
Norman Borlaug, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1970, and the Indian
agronomist M.S. Swaminathan. The ques¬
tions discussed included the conservation
of natural resources and the development
of ecotechnologies.

APPEAL BY THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF UNESCO
FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE PEACE PROCESS
IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Peace is proclaimed in treaties but made in the hearts and minds of peoples. The
premise on which UNESCO is founded remains as true as when it was affirmed fifty
years ago following "the great and terrible war . . . made possible by the denial
of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men,
and by the propagation in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the
doctrine of the inequality of men and races."
The Israeli and Palestinian peoples, sustained by the political vision and
courage of their leaders, are engaged in an historic process of reconciliation
aimed at bringing to an end long years of bloodshed and injustice and laying the
foundations for the construction of a culture of peace within their societies,
their territories and their region.
At this time when their commitment to peace is being so cruelly tested, I
appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian peoples not to be deflected from their course
by the terrorist's blind savagery. Let the actions of the extremists be seen for
what they areimpotence in the face of the peace process, an attack on peace
itself that is a challenge not only for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples but for
all the countries concerned.
Such outrages must not be allowed to prompt a return to the vicious circle
of retaliatory violence. The firmest measures must be taken to stamp out ter¬
rorism which is why I strongly support current initiatives to co-ordinate action
against terrorism in the region. We must show that our vision of peace with jus¬
tice is stronger and more enduring than any sectarian doctrine of hatred and
exclusion. Let peace be our common combat and shared victory.
I invite all those men and women who share the conviction expressed in this
Appeal to manifest their steadfast commitment to the peace process in the Middle
East by writing to me at UNESCO.

Education for tomorrow
by Jacques Delors
JACQUES DELORS,
former French Minister of the
Economy and Finance, was
President of the Commission of
the European Communities from
1985 to 1995. His published
works include /le nouveau concert
européen (1992) and Our Europe:
France and the European Future
(1994).
In 1993, UNESCO set up an independent International Commission on Education for
the 21st century, chaired by Mr. Jacques Delors. The Commission, whose members
(see inside back cover) and advisors were drawn from the major world regions, has
now completed its work. Here Mr. Delors presents for Courier readers a roundup of
the main issues studied by the Commission and previews some of its conclusions.
I On the eve of the twenty-first century,
I intense thought and discussion are being
devoted to the future of human society.
Whereas advances in knowledge, especially in
science and technology, bring hope of
progress for humankind in the future, events
each day remind us how the contemporary
world is liable to drift off course, how exposed
it is to dangers, in some cases extreme dangers,
and how vulnerable it is to conflicts.
The increasing interdependence of peoples
and nations, which is the hallmark of our time,
is providing scope for unprecedented interna¬
tional co-operation. But the emergence of this
global consciousness also reveals the extent of
the disparities that beset our world, the com¬
plexity of its problems and the number of
threats that are liable at any time to jeopardize
the stock of human achievement.
Great demands are consequently being
made on education, whose contribution to
human progress is so vital. The idea is gaining
ground that education is one of the most
powerful tools with which to shape the
future or, to use more modest terms, to
steer us into the future by taking advantage of
constructive trends and trying to avoid pit¬
falls. What is education doing today to pre¬
pare the active citizens of tomorrow?
UNESCO has taken the initiative of bringing
the light of its international experience to bear
on this issue. Its Director-General, Mr. Fed¬
erico Mayor, asked me to chair an International
Commission on Education for the Twenty-
first Century, mandated "to study and reflect
on the challenges facing education in the
coming years, and to formulate suggestions and
recommendations in the form of a report that
could serve as an agenda for action for policy¬
makers and officials at the highest levels".
The following question from the Com¬
mission's terms of reference formed our
point of departure: "How can education play
a dynamic and constructive role in preparing
individuals and societies for the twenty-first
century?" We were asking it some twenty
years after another Commission, chaired by
Mr. Edgar Faure, had published a report
which is still topical under the significant
title Learning to Be.
Four crucial issues
The Commission did its best to project its
thinking on to a future dominated by global¬
ization, to ask the right questions and to lay
down some broad guidelines that can be
applied both within national contexts and on a
global scale. Here I shall examine four issues
which I believe are crucial.
The first issue is the capacity of education
systems to become the key factor in devel¬
opment by performing a threefold func¬
tion economic, scientific and cultural.
Everyone expects education to help build up
a qualified and creative workforce that can
adapt to new technologies and take part in the
"intelligence revolution" that is the driving
force of our economies. Everyone in
North and South alike also expects educa¬
tion to advance knowledge in such a way that
economic development goes hand in hand
with responsible management of the physical
and human environment. And, finally, edu¬
cation would be failing in its task if it did not
produce citizens rooted in their own cultures
and yet open to other cultures and com¬
mitted to the progress of society.
The second crucial issue is the ability of
education systems to adapt to new trends in
society. This brings us to one of the funda-

mental responsibilities of education having to
prepare for change despite the growing inse¬
curity that fills us with doubts and uncertain¬
ties. Education must take into account a whole
range of interrelated and interreacting factors
that are always in a state of flux, whether it is
dealing with individual or social values, family
structure, the role of women, the status
accorded to minorities, or the problems of
urban development or the environment.
The third crucial issue is that of the relations
between the education system and the state.
The roles and responsibilities of the state, the
devolution of some of its powers to federal or
local authorities, the balance to be struck
between public and private education these
are just some aspects of a problem which,
moreover, differs from one country to another.
The fourth issue is the promulgation of
the values of openness to others, and mutual
understanding in a word, the values of
peace. Can education purport to be uni¬
versal? Can it by itself, as a historical factor,
create a universal language that would make
it possible to overcome certain contradic¬
tions, respond to certain challenges and,
despite their diversity, convey a message to
all the inhabitants of the world? In this lan
guage which, ideally, would be accessible to
everybody, all the world's wisdom and the
wealth of its civilizations and cultures would
be expressed in an immediately comprehen¬
sible form.
The creation of a language accessible to
everyone would mean that people would
learn to engage more readily in dialogue, and
the message that this language would convey
would have to be addressed to human beings
in all their aspects. A message that claims to
be universal one of education's lofty ambi¬
tions must be conveyed with all the subtle
qualifications that take full account of human
beings' infinite variety. This is no doubt our
major difficulty.
Lines of enquiry
Three current crises the economic crisis,
the crisis of the ideology of progress and a
certain form of moral crisis formed the
backdrop to the Commission's work.
With them in mind, I tried to trace out a
few lines of enquiry, taking account of cultural
diversity, the specific nature of different
problems and experiences, and the diversity
of the political and social objectives of
UNESCO's Member States, so as to gain a better

Lifelong education must be rethought and broadened. It should be a
continuous shaping of the personality, of knowledge and aptitudes, but
also of the critical faculty and the ability to act.

organization, T.R.A.C.K.S.
( "Training Resources and
Care for Kids"), helps to care

understanding of a number of fundamental
relationships: the connections between edu¬
cation and culture (culture being seen as a
factor in greater self-knowledge and knowl¬
edge of others); between education and citi¬
zenship and, more generally, the sense of
belonging (so that our contemporaries and
descendants do not feel isolated in the world
of exceptionally rapid change which they see
on their television screens); between educa¬
tion and social cohesion (which is weaker than
it was fifty years ago in the countries of both
North and South). And then, of course, the
connection between education, training,
work and employment; the connection with
development; and, lastly, the essential role
which education must play in the progress of
research.
If the proposals that emerged from the
Commission's work were to have a real
impact on education policies, three trans¬
versal problems also had to be tackled. These
were: the effect of modern communication
media on contemporary education systems;
the future of the teaching profession; the sys¬
tems to be set up and the funding to be found.
The pillars of education
The four main pillars that the Commission has
presented and illustrated as the bases of edu¬
cation are: learning to know, learning to do,
learning to be and learning to live together.
The first of these is learning to know.
Bearing in mind the rapid changes brought
about by scientific progress and new forms
of economic and social activity, there is a need
to combine a broad general education with
the possibility of working in depth on a
selected number of subjects. In a sense, such
a general education is the passport to learning
throughout life, insofar as it should teach
people to enjoy learning and also lay the
foundations that will enable them to carry on
learning throughout their lives.
Learning to do is the second pillar. In addi¬
tion to learning to practise a profession or
trade, people need to develop the ability to
face a variety of situations and to work in
teams, a feature of educational methods that
does not receive enough attention at present.
These skills are more readily acquired if pupils
and students have the opportunity to develop
their abilities by becoming involved in work
experience schemes or social work while they
are still in education. Increased importance
should thus be attached to all schemes in
which education alternates with work.
Learning to be was the theme of the Edgar
Faure Report published under UNESCO's aus¬
pices in 1972. The Report's recommendations
are still extremely relevant, for in the twenty-
first century everyone will need to exercise
greater independence and judgment combined
with a stronger sense of personal responsibility
for the attainment of common goals.
Learning to live together, finally, by devel¬
oping an understanding of others, of their his¬
tory, their traditions and their spirituality. This
would provide a basis for the creation of a
new spirit which, guided by recognition of
our growing interdependence and a common
analysis of the risks and challenges of the
future, would induce people to implement
common projects or to manage the inevitable
conflicts in an intelligent and peaceful way.
Some might say that this is Utopian; and yet it
is a necessary utopia, indeed a vital one if we
are to escape from the dangerous cycle sus¬
tained by cynicism and complacency.
Learning throughout life
The concept of learning throughout life advo¬
cated in the Faure Report is one of the keys
to the twenty-first century. It meets the chal¬
lenge of a rapidly changing world, and it is
necessary because of its advantages of flexi¬
bility, diversity and availability at different
times and in different places. It also goes
beyond the traditional distinction between
initial schooling and continuing education.
The idea of lifelong education must be
rethought and broadened. As well as adapting
8

<![CDATA[
to changes in working life, it should also com¬
prise a continuous shaping of the personality,
of knowledge and aptitudes, but also of the
critical faculty and the ability to act.
The truth is that every aspect of working
life and social life offers opportunities for both
learning and doing. There is a great temptation
to make too much of this, and stress the edu¬
cational potential of the media, the world of
work, and cultural and leisure pursuits, even
to the extent of forgetting a number of funda¬
mental truths. Although people need to use all
these opportunities for learning and self-
improvement, they will not be able to make
good use of all their potential unless they have
received a sound basic education. School
should impart a desire for and pleasure in
learning, the ability to learn how to learn, and
intellectual curiosity. One might even imagine
a society in which each individual would be in
turn both teacher and learner.
The basis for a learning society is a formal
system where each individual is introduced
to the many different forms of knowledge.
There is no substitute for the teacher-pupil
relationship based on authority and dialogue.
This has been said time and again by the great
classical thinkers who have studied the ques¬
tion of education. It is the teacher's responsi¬
bility to impart to the pupil the knowledge
that humankind has acquired about itself and
about nature, and the essence of human cre¬
ativity and inventiveness.
Education should therefore constantly be
adapting to changes in society, and also pass
on the attainments, foundations and benefits
of human experience.
The stages and bridges of learning: a
fresh approach
By focusing on the concept of learning
throughout life, the Commission did not
intend to convey the idea that one could
avoid reflecting on the different levels of edu¬
cation. The fact is that learning throughout life
makes it possible to reorder the sequences
and itineraries of education, ease the transi¬
tion from one stage to another and recognize
the value of each.
The "three Rs" reading, writing and arith¬
metic get their full due. The combination of
conventional teaching and out-of-school
approaches should enable children to experi¬
ence the three dimensions of education the
moral and cultural, the scientific and techno¬
logical, and the economic and social.
Basic education should be provided
worldwide for 900 million illiterate adults, 130
million children not enrolled in school, and

more than 100 million who drop out prema¬
turely. This vast undertaking is a priority for
technical assistance and partnership carried
out through international co-operation.
One major problem area in any reform
concerns the policies to be adopted for young
people after primary education. One might go
so far as to say that secondary schools tend to
be neglected in educational thinking. They are
the target of considerable criticism and pro¬
voke a considerable amount of frustration.
One source of frustration is a demand for
expansion and diversification of secondary
education, leading to rapid growth in enrol¬
ments and congestion in teaching pro¬
grammes. This gives rise to some classic prob¬
lems of mass education which developing
countries cannot easily solve either financially
or in terms of organization. Furthermore,
there is the discouraging problem of school
leavers who face a shortage of opportunities,
their distress increased by a widespread all-or-
nothing obsession with access to higher edu¬
cation. Mass unemployment in many coun¬
tries has exacerbated this malaise.
The only way out of this difficult situation
seems to be a very broad diversification of
types of study available. The latter should
include both conventional education, which
focuses more on abstraction and conceptual¬
ization, and approaches that combine school
and job experience in a way that brings out
other abilities and inclinations. In any event,
there should be bridges between these
approaches so that errors in choice of direction,
which are far too widespread, can be corrected.
Furthermore, the prospect of being able
to go back to education or training would
alter the general climate by assuring each

young person that his or her fate is not sealed
between the ages of fourteen and twenty.
Higher education should be seen from the
same angle.
In many countries, other types of higher
education institutions exist side by side with
universities. Some are highly selective, while
others were set up to provide specifically tar¬
geted, quality professional and vocational
training. This diversification obviously meets
the needs of society and the economy, both at
the national and regional levels.
Increasingly stringent selection in order to
ease the pressures brought about by mass
higher education in the wealthiest countries
is neither politically nor socially acceptable.
One of the main flaws in such an approach is
that many young people are expelled from
the educational process before they have
been able to obtain a recognized diploma and
find themselves in the desperate predicament
of having neither a degree nor training appro¬
priate for the job market.
There is a need to manage increasing uni¬
versity enrolment in tandem with reform of
secondary education.
Universities would contribute to this
process by diversifying what they offer: as
scientific establishments and centres of
learning leading to theoretical or applied
research or teaching; as establishments
offering professional qualifications, with
courses and content tailored to the needs of
the economy; as one of the main crossroads
for learning throughout life; as leading part¬
ners in a form of international co-operation
favouring exchanges of teachers and students
and promoting the wider availability of first-
class teaching through international profes¬
sorships.
These proposals have a special significance
in poor countries, where universities have a
decisive role to play.
Long-term strategies for reform
Without underestimating the obligation to
manage short-term constraints or disregard
the need to adapt existing systems, the Com¬
mission emphasized the need for a longer-
term approach if necessary reforms are to
succeed. By the same token, it stressed the
fact that reforms introduced in rapid succes¬
sion cancel each other out, since they do not
allow the system the time needed either to
absorb change or to involve all those con¬
cerned in the process.
Three main protagonists contribute to the
success of educational reforms: the local
community (parents, school heads and
teachers), the public authorities and the inter¬
national community.
Local community participation in assessing
needs by means of a dialogue betweens the
public authorities and social groups concerned
is a first essential stage in broadening access to
education and improving its quality. Contin¬
uing the dialogue by way of the media, com¬
munity discussions, parent education and
training, and on-the-job teacher training usu¬
ally arouses greater awareness, develops judg¬
ment and helps build local capacities.
In any event, no reform can succeed
without the co-operative and active participa¬
tion of teachers. The Commission recom¬
mended that the social, cultural and material
status of educators should be considered as a
matter of priority, along with the tools required
to deliver education of a high standard: books,
modern communication media, and suitable
cultural and economic support for the school.
This being so, one requirement for the
improvement of education systems is respon¬
sible public policy. Policy-makers cannot
assume that the market can compensate for
the failures in the system or that laisser-faire is
sufficient. The public authorities must pro¬
pose clear options and, after broad consulta¬
tion with all concerned, choose policies that
set guidelines for the system and lay its foun¬
dations, and regulate it by making the neces¬
sary adjustments.
All the choices to be made should be pred¬
icated upon the principle of equal opportunity.
During the Commission's deliberations, I
put forward a proposal that may be regarded as
radical. As education throughout life gradually
becomes a reality, all young persons could be
allocated an education voucher at the start of
their education. This would entitle them to a
certain number ofyears of education. Their enti¬
tlement would be credited to an account at a
bank which would manage a capital of time avail¬
able for each individual, together with the appro-
10

priate funds. Everyone could use their capital
for schooling, on the basis of their own choices.
Some of the capital could be set aside to enable
people to receive continuing education during
their adult lives. Each person could increase his
or her capital through deposits at the bank under
a kind of educational savings scheme.
The Commission supported this idea,
though it was aware of potential deviations
that might prejudice equality of opportunity,
and considered that vouchers might be allo¬
cated not at the beginning but at the end of
compulsory schooling so as to enable adoles¬
cents to choose a path without jeopardizing
their future choices.
As far as the international community is
concerned, as agent of the success of educa¬
tional reforms, the Commission framed a
number of suggestions concerning: a policy
of strong encouragement for the education of
girls and women; the allocation of a minimum
percentage of development aid (a quarter of
the total) to fund education; the development
of debt-for-education swaps to offset the
adverse effects on state education expendi¬
ture of adjustment policies and policies for
reducing internal and external deficits; the
widespread introduction of the new tech¬
nologies of the "information society" in all
countries, to prevent the growth of yet
another gap between rich countries and poor
countries; enlisting the outstanding potential
of non-governmental organizations.
These few suggestions should be seen in
the context of partnership rather than aid.
After so many failures and so much waste,
experience militates in favour of partnership.
Globalization makes it inescapable.
Conclusion
The interdependence of nations provides
scope for and requires international co¬
operation on a new scale and in all fields. The
International Commission on Education for
the Twenty-first Century is one of the ways
of asserting the will to achieve this as the turn
of the century draws near.
Without conducting a purely descriptive
exercise or outlining a philosophy of education
systems, its goal was not to construct "sce¬
narios for the future" resulting in a set of pre¬
cepts for educational policy-makers, but to
provide decision-makers with facts to help
them draw up educational policies and to spark
off a debate that would go beyond the world of
education and teachers, and involve parents,
children, business leaders, trade unionists and
associations engaged in giving education a
more effective role.
UNESCO AND UNICEF:
A JOINT CAMPAIGN
FOR
BASIC EDUCATION
In September 1992, Unesco and Unicef (the United Nations Chil-
dren's Fund) launched a joint "Monitoring Learning Achieve¬
ment (MLA) Project", as part of follow-up activities to the
World Conference on Education for All held at Jomtien (Thai¬
land) in 1990. The Project, which focuses on three main fields-
literacy, numeracy and basic life skillsseeks to provide policy¬
makers with analytical tools and indicators which will help
them to raise the quality of basic education. It also helps coun¬
tries to set up, train and support their own permanent moni¬
toring teams.
In 1993, five "pioneer countries"China, Jordan, Mali,
Morocco and Mauritiustook part in the first phase of the pro¬
ject. In addition to an intensive training workshop held at
Unesco's Paris Headquarters, 86 other workshops have been
organized in the pioneer countries and in Slovakia, providing
training for over 7,000 persons and some 250 "core trainers".
The target of 80 per cent of pupils attaining or surpassing a level
of minimum learning achievement is now being met in all par¬
ticipant countries and in the main basic learning competencies.
Analysis of the data collected through the Monitoring Project
and interpretation of the findings have enabled the specific edu¬
cational needs and priorities of each country to be identified.
A second group of 13 countries joined the project in 1994,
and after these two years' experience, an international work¬
shop was held at Unesco Headquarters from 17 to 19 May 1995
on the theme Monitoring Learning Achievement: towards
capacity building. A report on the workshop, bearing the same
title, has now been published for teachers, planners and policy¬
makers.

A WORLD EDUCATION REPORT OF 25 YEARS AGO
learning to be' in retrospect
by Asher Deleon
Almost a quarter of a century ago, Unesco published the findings
of a world enquiry into education in a report entitled Learning to Be.
How does this landmark study look today?
Above, lesson in a Brazilian
school north of Salvador,
capital of Bahia state.
I In 1972, the International Commission
I on the Development of Education
chaired by the former French prime minister
Edgar Faure published a report entitled
Learning to Be. The title reflected the climate
of euphoria and optimism of the times, gener¬
ated by economic and social achievements, the
ideology of steady progress, the official process
of decolonialization then being completed, the
positive consequences of "peaceful coexis¬
tence", and an enduring faith in international
co-operation. It is true that student revolt and
the "events" of 1968 had revealed a certain dis
enchantment, but the Report was based on
data from the previous decade. The first signs
of what later came to be regarded as an "edu¬
cation crisis" were just beginning to appear.
The key ideas
"Lifelong education" and "the learning
society" were the Report's two key ideas.
The former was considered as the "key¬
stone" of educational policies; the latter as a
strategy aimed at committing society as a
whole to education. The approach was based
12

<![CDATA[
on the idea of osmosis between education
and society, and sought to steer clear of a
number of misconceptions such as the ideas
of education as a "sub-system" of society, of
instruction as a tool for solving all individual
and social problems, and of the compartmen-
talization of life into "learning time" and "time
for living".
As its title indicates, the Report focuses on
learning, a process that goes beyond educa¬
tion and, a fortiori, teaching. Education and
teaching are described in it as dimensions that
are subordinate to the learning process.
School and out-of-school activities (formal,
non-formal and informal education) are
treated without hierarchical distinction, and
the importance of basic education for all and
of adult education is taken as a premise:
"learning is a process that lasts a lifetime, both
in its duration and in its diversity."
However, the Commission did not regard
lifelong education as a process of permanent
schooling, adult education or continuous
vocational training. It was seen neither as an
educational system nor an educational field,
but rather as "a principle on which the overall
organization of a system and hence the elabo¬
ration of each of its parts, are based". Lifelong
education is a need that is common to
everyone.
Learning must be redistributed not only
in time, but also in space. Thus the Faure
Commission called into question the
monopoly of institutionalized education. All
institutions, whatever their field of compe¬
tence (economic, social, cultural or informa¬
tional) can be used for educational purposes
and thereby help to build "a self-aware
learning society".
The Report focused on personal develop¬
ment and put learners, not teachers or edu¬
cational institutions, at the core of education.
The important thing is not the path followed
by the learner, but the outcome of the
learning process. Each one of us must be free,
as our judgment grows stronger and our
experience becomes richer and more varied,
to choose the ways best suited to our own
needs, expectations and abilities.
Learning

a lifetime, both in its
duration and in its
diversity.

or unjustified barriers and to rid traditional
structures of their excessively formal nature.
I am convinced that the basic ideas of the
Faure Report are still relevant in the final
decade of the twentieth century and that
from their standpoint the education gap the
backwardness, dysfunctions and shortcom¬
ings of education in relation to human
needs can gradually be overcome. The
theory behind these general guidelines is vir¬
tually never contested nowadays. Thousands
of experiments in recent decades have been
carried out along these lines. At the same
time, a battle still has to be waged against con¬
servatism at national level, the inadequate
commitment of international organizations,
external interference in the domestic affairs
of many states, and the rigidity of administra¬
tive, productive and other structures,
including the teaching profession.

Japan, Sweden, Norway and Argentina) have
taken their cue from the Faure Report's sug¬
gestions at the national level. Most experi¬
ments, although frequently interesting and
bold, carried out by local authorities, business
firms, educational establishments and associ¬
ations have been fragmentary and sporadic,
with limited resources. Even countries that
have long-established democratic and educa¬
tional traditions and achievements as well as
substantial financial resources hesitate to stray
from the beaten track and integrate changes
in the overall context.
Utopian leanings
One criticism that could be made of Learning
to Be is that it expected too much of educa¬
tion and did not take sufficient account of
economic and political conditions. It also
overestimated the material resources of the
developing countries and the extent to which
the industrialized countries were really
willing to provide them with substantial aid.

THE EDUCATION OF PRISONERS
BY STEPHEN DUGUID
Prison education may seem to be a contradiction in terms. Prisons
are authoritarian, coercive institutions. Education, on the other
hand, is generally seen as liberating, dependent on the free flow of
ideas and, in the case of adults, on opportunities to put into prac¬
tice ideas and skills learned in the classroom.
Despite these apparent contradictions there has grown up over
the past century or more a branch of adult education known as
"prison education". In developing countries the provision of edu¬
cation in prisons is a low national priority. Educational resources
are scarce and teachers are poorly trained.
In the nations of the former "socialist bloc" prison education
has been a formal partner in the reformative mandate given to
prison systems based on the premise that crime must be a devia¬
tion caused by ignorance rather than by social or cultural depri¬
vation. Education in prisons is an important tool in the effort to
have prisoners come to see the "error of their ways".
In the countries of the West the practice varies according to
political choices, available funding and the state of research. In
the past the dominant role for prison education was "schooling"
based on literacy, secondary school and vocational education pro¬
grammes. The rationale for such programmes lay in a complex
series of explanations for crime, largely based on sociological foun¬
dations. More recently the rationale has begun to shift back to
psychological causes for crime, and hence education programmes
are being asked to serve more specific ends such as addressing
addiction, violence, anger and sexual deviation.
Prison educators are constantly called on to justify them¬
selves, and in doing so have reached divergent though sometimes
complementary positions. Many educators focus on the ameliora¬
tive effect of education on the management of the prison. Others
have made a strong case for schooling in prison as a response to
the educational and cultural deprivation of the imprisoned or have
advocated the economic advantages of vocational training. The
most optimistic assert that education should play the leading role
or at least have an important place in the prison's rehabilitative
and reformative agenda.
In the past decade, prison educators around the world have
emerged from their isolated and isolating institutions and discov¬
ered a common vocation amongst divergent theories and praxis.
Teachers, administrators and researchers have taken part in a series
of international meetings in the U.S.A., Canada, the United
Kingdom, Sweden, Estonia and the Netherlands and taken the first
steps towards defining some common standards for education in
prison.
STEPHEN DUGUID,
of Canada, is associate professor of humanities at Simon Fraser University in
British Columbia and a specialist in adult education. He has written many
articles on education in prisons and participated in the work of Unesco's
International Commission on Education for the 21st Century.

between individuals, and between ethnic
groups, social classes and nations also reflect a
lack of realism that has given rise to disap¬
pointments.
The results achieved in the different
branches of education are far from satisfac¬
tory. The tiny percentage of young children
enrolled in pre-school education (a per¬
centage that is declining in several countries),
the enormous numbers of children who
receive no schooling at all, the figure of one
billion illiterates by the end of the century,
and the almost universal erosion of adult edu¬
cation these are facts that make it impera¬
tive to radically revise objectives and strategic
forecasts in these fields. Although the pri¬
mary responsibility lies with the national and
local authorities, the responsibility of the
international community, and particularly that
of UNESCO, should not be minimized.
Indeed, it might well be asked how far and
with what success UNESCO communicated
the message of the Report.
New parameters
Clearly, at the end of the 1960s it was impos¬
sible to predict the collapse of the Berlin Wall
and the failure of the communist experiment,
and the Faure Commission did not have the
means to study the issues connected with the
problems of indoctrination, education subject
to censorship, and manipulation of and by
education. However, the speed with which
political regimes have collapsed, the slow
progress of the necessary reforms, the
domestic conflicts, both political and armed,
inter-ethnic and religious, and the subjective
obstacles to the establishment of a market
economy cannot be understood without ref¬
erence to the distortions suffered by educa¬
tional practices in previous decades. The
International Commission on Education for
the Twenty-first Century chaired by Jacques
Delors may fill this gap, especially since the
international climate is favourable to it. The
failure of totalitarian regimes has encouraged
the growing ascendancy of the philosophy of
human rights, and it is increasingly clear that it
is in the link between education and democ¬
racy or, better still, between education and
freedom, that we should seek the guiding
principle of our educational policies.
In the field of economics, the Faure
Commission was able to benefit from the
auspicious situation created after three
decades of post-war efforts and the first two

decades of decolonization. The Delors Com¬
mission has had to confront a far gloomier
and more disturbing economic picture: crisis
affecting the South, the debt burden, the col¬
lapse of terms of trade for the main raw mate¬
rials, the ever-widening gap between indus¬
trialized and developing countries (with the
exception of a few Asian countries at an inter¬
mediate stage of development), unemploy¬
ment, the social and economic marginaliza¬
tion of a section of the urban and rural popu¬
lations in the industrialized countries.
Another question concerns the role of the
state. Disenchantment about the principle of
total, and even sometimes partial, state control
over education, budget austerity and the gulf
between educational supply and demand, as
well as dangers arising from the "commercial¬
ization" of education, have sometimes led to
questioning of the role of the state as the sole
manager of education and its main source of
funding. Some have suggested that it should
become a mere regulator, responsible for
maintaining an equitable system for distributing
resources and enforcing national standards for
examinations and qualifications. Others go
even further. The Delors Commission was
bound to take these problems into account.
The changes that have occurred in the edu¬
cational sciences in the last quarter of a century
are so far-reaching that they can be called rev¬
olutionary. The Faure Commission saw the
new educational technologies as a prerequisite
for bringing about most of the innovations.
Today, however, after the explosion of com¬
puter technology, multimedia and interactive
systems, the Delors Commission has had to
pay great attention to what Henri Dieuzeide, a
French authority in this field, has called "a new
visual order". "The audiovisual media present,
information technology organizes, telecom¬
munications brings closer," he notes in Les
Nouvelles Technologies, Outils d'Enseigne¬
ment (UNESCO/Nathan, Paris, 1994). "What is
going to happen when any educational activity
or exercise can be undertaken on a single piece
of hardware containing messages that in the
past were transmitted by an array of different
media? . . .The result will be to force different
and frequently antagonistic educational
approaches to draw closer together and to
work out common strategies for purposes of
presentation, structuring and manipulation."
Finally, humankind has entered a phase of
historical transition marked by the conflict
between human activities and environmental
constraints. We must invent a new paradigm
of development geared to the concept of sus-
tainability and define the ethical rules per¬
taining to it. We have no choice but to build
up new modes of production and consump¬
tion. Far from being masters of the universe,
we must understand that we are but the
guests or stewards of nature. It is through
education that we must "learn to be" nature's
partner and co-pilot.

Opening new doors in science

Science teaching must be rethought from primary
school to post-graduate level
Above, young visitors to the

Kingdom) peer into

place where people can learn
about science through "hands
on" experience.
In the twenty-first century, humanity
will have an opportunity to achieve an
ambition that has moral as well as technical
implications: it will be able to attain an all-
encompassing view of planet earth. Modern
communication technology, modern means
of transport and satellite-based observation
are already bringing the various parts of the
world closer together, and there are good
grounds for believing that, as a result, there
will be far fewer remaining pockets of polit¬

The planet-wide view thus made possible
by scientific and technological progress
nonetheless raises a problem of principle,
indeed almost a philosophical problem:
unless a very lofty purpose is assigned to sci¬
ence, unless the science we produce is more
than merely utilitarian, there will be no means
of surmounting a major cultural conflict that
we have seen developing at the end of this
century, one that is in fact much more serious
than is generally realized.
Decompartmentalizing science
The benefits of science and technology no
longer seem so obvious as they did in the last
century. Before the major conflicts of our

most of humankind's individual and general
problems. War has demonstrated that science

that barbarism still lurks beneath the surface
of civilization. Current debates over envi¬
ronmental issues and bioethics also reflect a
certain "culture gap" between science and
society. The ecological movement has not
only put science in an awkward position, it
has put it on trial. In order to overcome the
disenchantment now felt towards it, science
needs to be set within a far wider cultural
context.
One of the main dangers threatening sci¬
ence teaching comes from overspecialization.
Although specialization is undoubtedly a nec¬
essary condition for the improved training of
engineers and technicians, overspecialization
is in danger of alienating science from the
general public because it makes communica¬
tion more difficult and raises a serious
problem of social "acceptability". It is already
becoming evident, for instance, that research
in biology is likely to be held back more by
ethical and cultural considerations than by
economic ones.
Overspecialization may also lead to a lack
of "culture". Scientists must learn to respect
and practise other forms of language and
communication, while conversely, it would
be extremely dangerous to reject science on
the pretext of getting back to humanitarian
values. Science is part and parcel of culture,
and the practice of science should lead natu¬
rally on to the idea of international solidarity
and tolerance.
Science teaching is at present in a rut and
needs to be re-examined. This applies partic¬
ularly to textbooks. Physics is taught from
books on physics, and biology from works
on biology, whereas science teaching should
be much more cross-disciplinary. Why not
refer to the underlying problems of physics
when teaching molecular biology or, when
teaching biology, to the ethical questions that
are soon sure to come up?
The problem needs to be tackled both in
general and in specific terms. Due regard
must be shown both for the different cul¬
tures of different countries and for the uni¬
versality of science. This is the only way to
avoid fragmentation of knowledge, which is
harmful in every way. Science education will
SCIENCE AND THE
MARKET
The market plays a paradoxical role in the
spread of scientific knowledge. On the one
hand, more and more databases are being cre¬
ated and their information-processing capacity
is growing. This should facilitate the dissemi¬
nation of scientific data worldwide. On the
other hand, the high cost of accessing these
databases is a serious drawback. The data¬
bases are highly centralized, and are in danger
of becoming the exclusive property of a
restricted number of major scientific or tech¬
nical groups, large industrial organizations
wishing to preserve their market.
Cases in which the possessors of informa¬
tion keep it to themselves for commercial rea¬
sons are also starting to cause problems. The
ferocious competition in the pharmaceutical
industry, however useful it may be in stimu¬
lating research, is open to criticism insofar as
it works against the interests of countries
lacking the resources to participate in it. Here,
as in other fields, the right balance has not yet
been achieved.
Information should be regarded as part of
the common heritage of humanity, and clear
rules as to its dissemination should be estab¬
lished. F. G.

education literary, artistic, political or even
economic in order that the citizens of the
twenty-first century may see science pri¬
marily as an ally in achieving what they want
done for the good of their country or of civ¬
ilization as a whole.
More open, more diverse higher
education
After going through a period of crisis, in
Europe especially, universities can now aspire
to provide both a general culture and a prac¬
tical training for various occupations. It is,
however, increasingly true to say that the
training of scientists cannot be confined to a
single location.
First of all it will probably be necessary to
rethink the transition from secondary educa¬
tion to higher education. The former sharp
break between them is becoming less abrupt.
Much still remains to be done, however,
because in a way school students today are
more mature than their predecessors. In my
opinion they are far more receptive to sci¬
ence, technology and discussion about social
problems than is generally believed.
They first go to university to learn the
basics, then to laboratories to round out what
they have learned, then into industry to study
the technical applications, and in some cases
to museums or science parks to acquire a
broader overall view of science. This form of
networking, linking the university with other
professional institutions, will need to be rein¬
forced in the future. Perhaps we should also
rethink and diversify the traditional linear
progression from school to university, labo¬
ratory or business.
Furthermore, universities should not all
necessarily teach the same thing nor attempt
to cover all the ground. Although a common
core must be established, i.e. a basic scientific
culture without which studies cannot be car¬
ried forward, universities nevertheless have
to find their own specific roles in keeping
with the aspirations of the societies (and
regions) within which they operate. The
evaluation of universities should, however,
be carried out at international level: while cul¬
tural traditions and national goals vary from
country to country, science is preeminently
universal in character.
The growth of the student population in
universities raises considerable problems, since
it necessitates the training of adequate numbers
of specialist teachers in various fields. Univer¬
sities should therefore have an open-door
policy and should allow scientists great
freedom of movement, both within their "own
country and internationally. Although this
means that they should set their sights high and
have plentiful resources, they cannot restrict
themselves to training an elite. The French
"Grandes Ecoles", for instance, provide an
excellent education and produce some remark¬
able people, but perhaps they fail to take

account of the diversity of individual talents.
The Grandes Ecoles, in my view to their credit,
are making a real effort to open up to the wider
university system and to the business world.
Thought should also be given to the pos¬
sibly disproportionate importance attached to
mathematics in the selection of students.
Mathematics is one of the highest forms of
intellectual activity and can be used to assess
an individual's capacity for abstraction and
rapid thinking, but it is going too far to take it
as the sole criterion.
Teaching students
to be team players
If we are looking for a system that is fully
appropriate to the needs of the coming cen¬
tury and as receptive as possible to all forms
of cultures, we need to prepare the ground in
primary and secondary schools. By the uni¬
versity level it is already too late. I believe it is
essential to introduce the teaching of the his¬
tory of science from the primary level on, so
as to situate science within a cultural context.
Science would then be gradually integrated
into the teaching process in a pluralist way,
with efforts being made to maintain a balance
with other subjects and outlooks.
In secondary school, hands-on scientific
experiments should be introduced at a very
early stage. This is crucial, since such activi¬
ties bring students face to face with their
responsibilities, teaching them that they must
be able to work as members of a team, must
have an acutely critical outlook and must
realize that there is not just one, but several
possible approaches to the solution of prob¬
lems in short, that life itself puts us in situa¬
tions that constantly require us to solve diffi¬
cult practical problems.
There have long been calls for secondary-
level science to be taught in this way, but it is
not easy to set up. The logistics are expensive,
and teachers are not always adequately
trained for this kind of work. This is one of
the reasons why France has established uni¬
versity-level teacher education institutes
(Instituts Universitaires de Formation de
Maîtres), whose students have the opportu¬
nity to take training courses in laboratory
work. The institutes aim to provide an inter¬
disciplinary training course, showing how
problems are linked to one another, not only
across subject boundaries but also within
society as a whole, while enabling trainees
from different backgrounds to establish a
close relationship with experimental science.
It is, however, too soon to pass judgment on
the effectiveness of these institutions.
The acquisition of knowledge in the
twenty-first century will probably be a
halfway house between computerized mes¬
sages of the highest level of abstraction at one
end of the spectrum and highly specialized,
sophisticated technologies at the other: scien¬
tists will therefore have to be able to move
freely between these two extremes.

Sharing knowledge
by Pierre Lena

most recent published work

At a time when there is a
worldwide trend for knowl¬
edge to become the pre¬
serve of the most highly developed
countries, one of the major prob¬
lems facing the university system is
that of sharing the information
accumulated by the major scien¬
tific research centres.
The critical point for the
transfer of knowledge comes
when students from the devel¬
oping countries who have
obtained their doctorates in the
industrialized countries return
home to put their knowledge to
use. They find that there are few
satisfactory job opportunities
and in many cases are isolated in
their research. Even students
from the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics established
by Professor Abdus Salam in Tri¬
este (Italy) find themselves in a
similar situation. The problem is
that there is at present no real
concerted policy which would
allow scientific centres to come
into being outside the industrial¬
ized countries.
Chile is an especially inter¬
esting case in this respect. It has
some of the best sites in the
world for astronomy, and the
United States, Europe and Japan
a re all interested in them. For the
country's own scientific develop¬
ment to benefit from this natural
asset, now being exploited by
others, it would be fairly logical
to envisage a kind of "levy" on
telescopes installed by foreign
countries, i.e. by making them
available for part of the time to
Chilean scientists. Negotiations
on these lines are being carried
out with Europe and have already
been concluded with the United
States.
But opportunities for access
to technical equipment, however
powerful the equipment may be,
are not in themselves a guarantee
of sustainable scientific develop¬
ment. Building a scientific com¬
munity is a long process that,
even when conditions are
favourable, does not always pro¬
duce immediate results. A reason¬
able aim for Chile would be to set
up an International Centre for the
Sciences of the Universe, possibly
to be shared by the whole of Latin
America, playing a similar role to
that played for physics in Europe
by the Trieste Centre.

SCIENCE MADE
SIMPLE
BY JAYANT V. NARLIKAR
The challenge of popularizing science and helping people to
appreciate science as part of their culture can be approached
on four levels.
At primary school the first thing to do is encourage
curiosity about nature. Children generally start with this
curiosity, but educational systems often stifle it. Next they
must be taught the concept of a pattern in natural phenomena,
and then be gradually introduced to the mathematical or quan¬
titative aspects of nature. The teacher should then show how
nature follows certain laws and that therefore predictions can
be made about it. If these aspects are incorporated into pri¬
mary education, children will begin to appreciate the sciences
as an important part of their education.
The main goal of secondary education should be to empha¬
size the experimental verification of scientific laws. Children
should be made aware of the historical development of science
through the interplay of theory with experiment. The history of
science should be taught in a way that shows how scientists
actually learnby making mistakes and correcting them.
The aims of higher education should be to provide students
with access to source material that will supplement classroom
teaching and work with textbooks, and to make sure they have
opportunities to discuss, ask questions, argue and interact
with their teachers. Students should be made aware of the fron¬
tiers of research and should see research being done around
them. They should do projects to find out what interests them
and to add to the content of science. Students often do not dis¬
cover what they really like until it is too late.
One of the chief purposes of science popularization for the
general public is to help people learn to live comfortably with
science and technology. The limitations as well as the powers
of science should be appreciated. Scientists often get carried
away and give the impression that science is a panacea. This
provokes a backlash from those who say: How can you offer
answers to everything when you know that science is incom¬
plete? The solution is to share the failures as well as the tri¬
umphs. These things can be conveyed in books, lectures and
films made for the general public.

I Although education in the United States
I has not traditionally been regarded as a
matter for the Federal Government, in recent
years the latter has set about transforming the
education system on a national scale by setting
minimum standards and common objectives
for all schools, thus creating a general frame of
reference.
There are three essential aspects to these
standards and objectives: they lay down what
young Americans should have learned by the
end of a certain number of years of schooling;
they describe relevant and effective methods
to be used for the teaching, in three- or four-
year instalments, of the various subjects; and
they set forth methods of evaluation adapted
to these new criteria. They also list the condi¬
tions to be met for putting this new frame of
reference into effect.
A flexible, open system
These measures bear certain resemblances to
those relating to the establishment of school
curricula in France in the late nineteenth cen¬
tury by Jules Ferry, except for the fact that
they allow local institutions wide freedom of'
choice as to the methods and resources used
to attain the objectives.
In the case of mathematics, the standards,
drawn up with the help of all the parties
involved in the changes chiefly high-school
and college teachers, but also businessmen,
parent-teacher associations and politicians
have already been promulgated. This process,

alchemy, was carried out with the co-opera¬
tion of all those competent in the subject, thus
avoiding the mistakes made thirty years ago
when modern maths were introduced. Similar
standards are now being prepared for science
teaching and will soon be brought into force
for all subjects.
This idea of a "wide-mesh" education system
creates favourable conditions for a genuine
debate among the various people and institu¬
tions actively involved in the system. It also
makes it possible to take specific local condi¬
tions into account and to optimize the manage¬
ment of each community's resources. The greater
the scope for initiative, and hence autonomy, at
the local level, the more necessary it becomes to
lay down a general framework that is flexible
enough to let such initiatives be put into effect.
In the next century we shall very likely all
have to come to terms with the definition of
objectives on a national, or even international,
scale and, on the other hand, the need for ini¬
tiatives at the local level.
The educational role of museums
There is, however, a risk that such initiatives
will come to nothing unless schools them¬
selves undergo a transformation at the same
time. The substantial rise in the numbers of
schoolchildren brought about by population
growth will bring the whole education system
to a standstill unless it is reorganized.
The experience of my own institution, the
San Francisco Exploratorium, may be of some
interest in this respect. An experimental

centre, founded in 1969, its purpose is to bring
basic scientific knowledge to a wide audience,
parents and teachers as well as students. It is
open to all comers and provides learning aids,
access to on-line services (Internet, for
example), teachers and guides, all with the aim
of putting users in the frame of mind to go on
asking more questions and allowing constantly
changing new learning techniques and
methods to be tried out.
These techniques, worked out jointly by
the teachers and engineers with the help of the
learners themselves, aim to stimulate debate
on science, its social applications and the ethical
problems it raises, and also on the processes
(metacognition) at work in science.
The Exploratorium is also a meeting-place
for prospective teachers, where they can
acquire a foretaste of their future job. The ini¬
tial training it provides, though by definition
insufficient for a proper vocational qualifica¬
tion, aims mainly to put across the idea of con¬
tinuing education as something quite natural.
In science, this initial training consists chiefly
of familiarizing trainees with the experimental
approach and with how to give lessons, but it
also teaches them how to learn by instilling in
them a capacity to stand back and examine
their own methods objectively.

reconsidered in the United States. These cen¬
tres are in the process of changing, from being
mere adjuncts to formal education to
becoming experimental logistical bases for the
transformation of the whole educational
system. Excellent as the universities are as
regards research and academic knowledge,
experience has shown that they are often ill
suited to providing trainee teachers with the
sort of skills an appropriate professional
training requires, whereas the scientific cen¬
tres possess, as compared with the universi¬
ties, a remarkable degree of freedom in terms
of their timetables, programmes and organiza¬
tion and the use they make of their premises
and of available technologies.
A move towards
school autonomy
As well as to the part that scientific centres
could play in education in general, considera¬
tion needs to be given to the future of schools
themselves.
The fact that schools do not at present
enjoy real autonomy in the management of
their resources reduces their power of initia¬
tive and hampers the adaptation of the educa¬
tion system as a whole to the changes made
necessary by its own expansion. Schools
operate on the basis of directives given to
them rather than agreed objectives that would
leave them free to allocate resources in such a
way as to produce results best suited to local
conditions. This makes it particularly difficult
to create a learning environment that would
enable any substantial improvement in pupils'
performance to be obtained and would be
conducive to equal opportunity while taking
account of local factors.
A move towards autonomy for schools has
started in the United States as a result of pres¬
sures from parents, learned societies and
industry, but schools have still received no
indications as to the most suitable types of
organization and management required. Guid¬
ance from outside experts is therefore essential
for the gradual implementation of the changes
foreseen. This alone will enable serious mis¬
takes to be avoided.

Schools at the
crossroads
by Robert Bisaillon
Schools often seem to be standing still
I while the rest of the world moves on.
However, a number of social changes now
look set to challenge educational systems and
the functions of education.
Schools are at a crossroads. On the one
hand, the state seems unwilling to go on
financing and directing education; on the other,
schools and local authorities would like to have
more of a say in these matters themselves.
In these circumstances, the role of
schools and their place in society become less
straightforward than they were. In competi¬
tion with other institutions such as the family

and the workplace, which are themselves in
the throes of change, schools no longer have
a monopoly on the dissemination of knowl¬
edge. New information and communication
technologies are putting teachers to the test
and making them re-examine their approach
to education.
The ways by which young people acquire
knowledge have changed. Acquisition by
absorption, a process encouraged by the media,
is taking over from the traditional process in
which the family and the school acted as the
intermediaries. But the media appeal to young
people's curiosity and emotional responses in a
random fashion, and schools find it very hard
to put knowledge acquired from the media into
some sort of order so that schoolchildren can
benefit from it.
The concept of skills has also taken on a
broader meaning. As well as transmitting
knowledge and know-how to their pupils,
teachers must train them to find information
for themselves and to make use of it. Pupils'
skills are now defined in terms of their self-
reliance and their ability to adapt to different
types of training and jobs.
In a society where there is more and more
cultural intermingling and where there are

fewer and fewer fixed points of reference,
teachers are expected to show children how
to form their own values.
Lastly, the phenomenon of students
"working their way through college" is a typ¬
ical feature of life in North America, where
the school population is drawn from mixed,
multiethnic backgrounds. All these factors
have a strong influence on thinking about
what is required of schools and about ways of
achieving integration.

of Canada, has been President of
Quebec's Conseil Supérieur de
l'Education ("Education Board of
Governors") since 1989.
Education and politics
The situation raises a number of socio-polit¬
ical questions, such as how to reconcile
elitism with democracy without widening
social cleavages or how to expound a uni¬
versal culture respectful of national identities
without encouraging racism and intolerance.
In this context, how should the roles of the
state, the school and the individual be defined?
A definition of a "common public culture",
encompassing a set of non-negotiable values
that are necessary to social cohesion, is perhaps
called for. This set of values could serve as a
common core for the education of all groups,
minority or majority, sedentary or nomadic,
without infringing the basic rights of any of

them. These consensual values could justifiably
be invoked to challenge the authority of
schools designed to emphasize religious or
ethnic differences. Again, instead of intro¬
ducing new subjects into syllabuses, would it
not be better to reorganize existing syllabuses
transversally to encourage knowledge and
understanding of other languages and cultures ?
Education could in this way become truly a
factor working for peace.
On a matter more directly related to the
social and economic context, the kind of gen¬
eral knowledge that opens pupils' minds to
the world around them needs to be com¬
bined with vocational qualifications enabling
them to find a place in economic life. Since
one of the aims of education is to provide
. young people with the means of changing the
society in which they live, they should first
understand how it works and how it can be
improved.
In all these respects teachers have a leading
role to play, which is why one of the most
basic changes to the system concerns the
teaching profession. More emphasis in pre-
service training should be attached to teachers'
individual and collective responsibility, i.e. the
development of professionalism should be the
guiding principle. Next, in view of the length
of teachers' careers, pre-service training, prac¬
tical experience and in-service training should
form a continuum. Success depends on
responsible commitment, by each according
to his or her role and competence, on the part
of all those who determine educational poli¬
cies, who are in charge of schools and whose
daily business is education.

THE PROSPECTS
FOR TEACHERS
BY BILL RATTEREE
The training of what may well be more than 50 million teachers
worldwide by the year 2000 and payment for their services-
representing from 50 to 80 per cent of current public educa¬
tional expenditure in almost all countriesconstitute an enor¬
mous investment.
For this investment to be fully realized, the training, recruit¬
ment and career prospects of teachers must be interlocked in
such a way as to favour a dynamic and creative schooling envi¬
ronment. Recruitment criteria will need to favour aptitude and
motivation to teach, not just the acquisition of credentials.
Career structures will need to provide instructional rather than
administrative paths for highly skilled teachers. There must be
equality of opportunity and treatment between men and
women.
As far as salaries and other material benefits are con¬
cerned, the evidence suggests that with a few exceptions in
high-income countries, teachers' salaries have not maintained
comparability with professions requiring similar qualifications.
The consequences include: a decline in the quality of individ¬
uals recruited into teaching, the loss of qualified and experi¬
enced teachers who are attracted to other jobs, and general
lack of interest in sustaining creative performance. The impact
is most dramatic in low-income countries subject to economic
and fiscal restrictions, where multiple job-holding, teacher
absenteeism and recourse to private teaching schemes are
becoming the rule.
It is thus indispensable to ensure salaries comparable to
rates of equivalent professionals and to formulate strategies
to establish material incentives broad enough to motivate all
teachers. The alternative is that schooling in many countries
will inexorably decline, as basic skills are not taught or taught
poorly, student dropout levels among low-income families will
increase and the education system will fail to carry out its basic
mission.

Distance education in the
high-tech era
Menahe 111 YaarI, President of the Open University of Israel,
talks to Jasmina Sopova
How does distance education fit
into current educational practice?
Menahem Yaari: Several kinds of institu¬
tions in the world practise it, notably a large
number of traditional universities that are
gradually opening departments of this kind.
They are, you might say, "mixed" institu¬
tions. There are also institutions like the
National Technological University (NTU)
in the United States that operate uniquely
as distance education entities but by using
the traditional course material of other
leading universities. They act as an agent, as
it were. There are also about twenty uni¬
versities like ours that develop their own
course material and broadcast it via satellite,
thereby using the most up-to-date com¬
munication technology.
What is special about the Israeli
version?
The control room of the Open
University of Israel's satellite
studio.
M. Y.: We have based our system exten¬
sively on the one developed in Britain
twenty-five years ago. But we've taken it
even further. The British Open University
is mostly concerned with the social sci¬
ences, while Israel's covers a broader
range of subjects, particularly the sciences.
Its teaching is much more diversified.
For each subject there are at present
about 400 we set our own course mate¬
rial and ask the most qualified experts
Israel has to offer to develop the course.
This ensures a very high standard. We can
boast of the fact that our courses are used
as working documents by a large number
of students and professors in other Israeli
universities.
From its inception the University used

Established in 1974, the Open University of Israel
is one of the world's few nationwide distance edu¬
cation universities. It has a study centre in
Jerusalem and almost 90 more scattered
throughout the country. In addition to an impres¬

studies, the university offers nearly 400 courses (in

ences, the life and natural sciences, mathematics,
computer science, music, humanities and art.
able video, cable television and com¬
puters but we took a revolutionary step
in 1994 when we introduced multimedia
and interactive studies by satellite.
How does a course by satellite
work?
M. Y.: Unlike other courses, courses by
satellite take place live. The professor is in a
studio at our broadcasting centre in Tel
Aviv. A satellite dish connects him to some
sixty receiving centres scattered
throughout the country. The studios in the
Tel Aviv centre are equipped with a video
camera, facilities making it possible to pre¬
sent transparencies and slides directly on
the video, a colour scanner, a personal com¬
puter for graphic presentation of informa¬
tion and a console enabling the teacher to
communicate directly with the students.
The teacher also has at his disposal all the
relevant information about his students:

how many there are, their names and their
academic background. The classrooms are
equipped with a large screen, personal
computers and telephones so that students
can dialogue with their teacher.
All this must demand high-level
organization. . .
M. Y.: Yes. As well as the experts we ask to
develop our courses, the Open University
of Israel employs its own faculty (teaching
assistants, lecturers and professors), like any
other university. But instead of giving
courses, the professors provide course
follow-up by supervising their content.
They also have to make sure that assess¬
ments, final examinations and teaching
materials are up to an acceptable standard.
We are also on the cutting edge of self-
evaluation. We are perfectly aware of each
course's contents and each student's
results. All these data enable us to assess
the quality of our teaching. We have direct
access to courses, and if something goes
wrong, we know about it at once and can
rectify it from one day to the next.
Does this kind of organization
make the system complicated and
costly?
M. Y.: Just the opposite. The experts who
develop our courses work for other insti¬
tutions. We pay only fees, which consid¬
erably reduces our overheads without
diminishing the quality of our teaching.
The Open University of Israel now
pays for itself. For the first fifteen years of

Conquering time
and space
One message that Unesco is trying to get
across is that education does not neces¬
sarily mean going to school. Continuing
education and distance education are the
two key concepts for broadening the scope
of traditional education.
Continuing education means giving
those who have "outgrown" school-going
age a chance to improve their skills or to
retrain according to their needs or job-
market demands. It also encourages the
social reintegration of marginalized young
people, like those, for example, who have
been demobilized after a war. Unesco has
established a training programme of this
kind in local languages for young Haitians,
its existence it was sponsored by the
Rothschild Foundation, which was its ini¬
tiator. But for the past few years enrol¬
ment and the sale of our own books (some
450,000 per year) provide for 75 per cent
of our budget, with the rest coming from
the state. By way of comparison, govern¬
ment financial support for other institu¬
tions is about 75 per cent. It's true, how¬
ever, that they are more heavily engaged
in research than we are.
Moreover, we don't need a campus.

Palestinians, Rwandans and Mozambicans,
and several scientific, technical and profes¬
sional training projects for women in sub-
Saharan Africa are also on the drawing
board.
Distance should be no obstacle to educa¬
tion. China, India and Brazil, which rank
among the world's nine most populated and
least literate countries, are planning to over¬
come the problems of distance by using satel¬
lites to televise educational programmes.
Studies have shown that although this kind
of teaching is initially very costly, it may be
more economical in the long run than tradi¬
tional schooling. Unesco is doing all it can to
promote effective partnership between gov¬
ernments, non-governmental organizations
and business so that these countries can ben¬
efit from quality programmes and broad¬
casting technology.
Our study centres are mostly located in
the country's primary or secondary
schools, which we are able to use when
they are not occupied at specific times of
the day. In this way distance education
becomes one of the least costly educa¬
tional systems that exist.
What are the other advantages of
distance education?
M. Y.: Apart from the fact that it enables
working people or students living far from
university towns to continue their studies
near home, it offers the possibility of
teaching beyond the borders of any given
country. In this regard distance education
can become a basic tool for building peace,
especially in the Middle East where bor¬
ders have begun to open up. But opening
borders isn't enough. For people to cross
them, education is essential. And when I
talk about crossing borders I'm not refer¬
ring only to the physical sense; I mean
exchanging ideas and establishing a real dia¬
logue. It is clear by now that with the
advance in technology that enables us to
reach the remotest villages distance edu¬
cation is the best way to establish this dia¬
logue. It is even likely that this form of
teaching will gradually replace the more
traditional form, which is for the moment
at least still dominant just about every¬
where in the world.

I needs to rethink its education systems.
All too often, the systems of education inher¬

Africa more or less intact, generally on the
grounds of "maintaining standards". What
this actually means is that a very small elite
enjoys exactly the same kind of education as it
would have in Europe, while the vast
majority are deprived of any form of modern
education whatever.
The failure of these educated elites to
transform their countries from feudal social

the East Asian elites who have managed to
make their economies more efficient than the
Western economies that they began by imi¬

The Japanese model
East Asia has been strongly influenced by the
Japanese model. In the nineteenth century,
the Japanese realized that it was essential for
their survival as a nation to appropriate
Western mathematics, science and tech¬

and social values. Compulsory primary edu¬

quently achieved, and after the Second World
War access to post-secondary education
became available for the majority. But while
they sought to imitate, and later to surpass,
Western science and technology, the
Japanese insisted on the primacy of their own
language, literature, culture and religion.
Africa has not made such a conscious
choice. The introduction of Western education
into Africa by Christian missionaries meant that
the educated elite was more steeped in Chris¬
tian theology, history, literature and culture than
in science and technology. This strong bias
towards the humanities still exists today.
Probably the most visible symptom of
this Western orientation was the rejection of
African languages in the education system.
Even now African languages are not taught in
most French- or Portuguese-speaking coun¬
tries, and even some English-speaking coun¬
tries have denigrated the use of African lan¬
guages as "divisive" and "tribalistic". To the
African Christian convert African culture
was synonymous with superstitition and

backwardness and was generally rejected as
"uncivilized". In other words, the educated
African adopted the European conception of
' kM traditional African culture.
Redefining the purpose of education
Very few African countries have attained pri¬
mary education for all, despite the fact that
many have been independent for some thirty
years. At the secondary level, the record is
even worse. Many African countries only
provide secondary education for 4 or 5 per
cent of the appropriate age group. In most
African countries, less than one per cent of
the relevant age group goes on to any form of
post-secondary education, compared to
between 25 and 75 per cent in the industrial-,
ized countries. Those who do are unlikely to
specialize in science or technology.
It is within this context that we need to re¬
examine the connection between education
and economic development on the one hand,
and education and cultural values on the other.
"Development" must be defined more
clearly. At present Africa's development
strategy appears to be based almost exclusively
on structural adjustment, although this is
clearly a far too narrow and economist con¬
ceptualization of development, which does
not take into account such extremely impor¬
tant factors as a country's level of human-

resource development or its level of eco¬
nomic diversification and industrialization.
Education also needs to be redefined. The
systems and structures of the past should not
be retained uncritically. Education must serve a
purpose, and Africa needs to decide what that
purpose is. While it has a critical role to play in
economic development, it has an equally
important role in creating and defining the
values that will make Africa politically and cul¬
turally united, coherent and forward-looking.
Only when the purpose of education has been
clearly defined can Africa decide what type of
education is suitable for its development.
In deciding on that purpose the global vil¬
lage and the global market must be kept in
mind. It is no longer possible for Africa to
perpetuate its colonial and feudal heritages by
continuing with the educational systems and
structures of the past whilst ignoring the
transformation of the rest of the world into
technologically advanced industrialized
economies. On the other hand, Africa is the
least polluted and least environmentally dam¬
aged continent. As the latest entrant into the
modernization process, it may be able to
avoid the terrible environmental and human
damage caused by that process.

Education has played a central role in Asian tradition ever
since the time of Confucius
Ibove, on the way to school.
ZHOU NANZHAO,
a Chinese educator, Is Vice-
President and professor at the
China National Institute for
Educational Studies in Beijing.
32
I In Asia learning has been cherished
I ever since the time of Confucius, who
believed that human beings are perfectible
and can be led along the right path through
education. He emphasized the power of edu¬
cation to improve society and to teach citi¬
zenship, and for centuries education was the
foundation of the political, social, economic
and cultural life of Asian peoples.
Attention has often been drawn to this pro¬
found appreciation of the value of education.
Working Asian mothers, bending low in the
rice fields, have always hoped that education
would enable their children to escape from
poverty. Stories and images from many coun
tries record Asian women's aspirations for their
children, ranging from the well-known figure
of the Japanese mother who regards educating
her offspring as her prime duty, to the Chinese
mother who for years travelled long distances
to evening classes and taught her disabled son
with the notes she took, and Korean mothers
who would sell their cows to pay for their chil¬
dren's schooling. The writings of Mahatma
Gandhi and the great Indian poet Rabindranath
Tagore offer further testimony of the value
attached to education by Asians.
Not surprisingly, therefore, Asian parents
and teachers have high expectations of the
young, and studies have shown that these
expectations go hand in hand with high cur¬
riculum standards, long hours spent on
learning, strict training in intellectual skills, a
high degree of parent-children interaction at
home, close teacher-pupil relations at school
and high educational achievement, especially
in such intellectually demanding courses as

mathematics. Since there is no substantial dif¬
ference in the intelligence quotient of most
children and no children are ineducable, it is
clear that this cultural factor helps to account
for the relatively high scholastic achieve¬
ments of many Asian students.
Learning to be team players
Traditionally, collectivism has taken prece¬
dence over individualism in Asian cultures.
Confucianism emphasized the development
of the individual as a member of the family
and of society at large, and learning the rules
of social relationships was considered an
essential step towards becoming a mature and
responsible person. For centuries Chinese
intellectuals upheld the moral ideal of
"bearing the worries of the world before
anyone else and enjoying the pleasures of life
after all others". This group-oriented attitude,
classically displayed in the "team spirit" of the
Japanese, has been conducive both to eco¬
nomic productivity and social cohesion. It
partly explains why many Asians tend to dis¬
like the concept of competition among indi¬
viduals yet display a high degree of competi-
tivity in a collective setting.
Another cultural tradition that has shaped
the Asian approach to education is an
emphasis on the spiritual rather than the
material dimension of development. Tradi¬
tional Chinese culture, for example, was
essentially based on ethics, stressing the
moral cultivation of the personality. Today it
is still widely recognized in Asia that educa¬
tion cannot be value-free, and in many coun¬
tries the building of both "spiritual" and
"material" civilizations is the twin goal of
national development.
The idea of a meritocracy based on per¬
formance in state examinations rather than on
inherited wealth has long been accepted in
Asia. Whereas the theoretical goal of Confu¬
cian education was the cultivation of the
person in the ethical sense, in practice it
tended to be more concerned with the
preparation and selection of a ruling elite. For
Confucius, education was a powerful instru¬
ment which this elite could use to govern the
state. By education the ruler should "learn to
care for the people" while the ruled "learned
to be obedient". Care from above and obedi¬
ence from below were supposed to lead to a
stable social order. The authority of the
parent at home and that of the teacher at
school went a long way to explain the disci¬
pline of most Asian students.
Extended to the political and economic
sphere, the authority of the state favoured a co¬
operative, harmonious relationship between

business and government and facilitated the
implementation of government policy.
Authoritarian modern government has been
said to be one of the factors accounting for the
economic miracles of East Asian countries.
But if this is so, why have economies with
cultural traditions that are supposedly so con¬
ducive to development only recently
embarked on rapid growth? Some scholars
have seen Confucianism as a conservative,
anti-modernizing force. This might be an
exaggeration, but it is safe to say that, apart
from more fundamental economic and polit¬
ical factors that have hampered development,
some features of traditional cultures partly
explain why an industrial economy was so
slow to take off in many Asian countries.
These features include:
the "politicization" of educational- cul¬
tural values and lack of governmental com¬
mitment to economic modernization. Educa¬
tional institutions were used as mere instru¬
ments in political strife and as an appendage
to the government apparatus;
neglect of individuality. The collective
interest was grossly over-emphasized and the
individual was reduced to the status of an
instrument;

over-emphasis on classics-oriented exami¬

contempt for pragmatism, utilitarianism
and business. Confucian idealism neglected
science and technology. It separated brain
from hand and scholarship from craftsman¬
ship. The educated elite were entitled to rule
simply by virtue of their "superior morality",
without having to acquire practical knowl¬
edge or skills. Matters of utilitarian value were
despised, and business was regarded as an
occupation of low social status. It is partly due
to these cultural attitudes that vocational and
technical education are neglected even today
in many developing Asian countries.
gender bias. For centuries women were
relegated to household drudgery and played a
negligible role in society. This explains why
girls received much less schooling than boys
and also helps to account for the persistently
high ratio of girls in the numbers of school
dropouts in Asia (two-thirds during 1985-
1992). Low educational levels among Asian
women have resulted in high infant mortality,
high population growth in rural areas, worse
conditions for children's nutrition and health
and a stagnant economy.

globalization their educational systems have
begun to advocate the teaching of a core of
universal values. These values include: aware¬
ness of human rights combined with a sense
of social responsibilities; social justice and
democratic participation in decision-making
and government; understanding and tolerance
of cultural differences and pluralism; caring
and co-operation; a spirit of enterprise, cre¬
ativity,' sensitivity to equality of the sexes,
open-mindedness to change and a sense of
obligation to environmental protection and
sustainable development.
Most of these values are rooted in time-
honoured cultural traditions. The "spirit of
caring" is embedded in Confucian "benevo¬
lence" and Buddhist "mercy". Sensitivity to
environmental protection was expressed in
ancient China by the Taoists' concern about the
destructive consequences of technology on
natural resources. Altruism has been respected
as the highest human value in Asia for hundreds

may find that elements of the wisdom of Con¬
fucianism are as relevant as they were long ago.
One way of fostering universal values for
future centuries, therefore, is to educate the
young with great books of the past.
Another approach that should be fostered
is educational bridge-building between East
and West. Culturally East and West are com¬
patible and complementary. The Confucian
scholar-official selected according to merit
rather than hereditary privilege is close to the
ancient Greek idea of "government by the
best". If East and West can learn from each
other and integrate each other's cultural
strengths individual initiative with team
spirit, competitiveness with co-operative-
ness, technological skills with moral quali¬
ties then universal values and a global ethic
will gradually develop. This renewal of cul¬
tures is a great contribution that education can
make to humanity.

This dossier provides a brief glimpse of Unesco's activities in education, which are at the heart of its
mission to construct "the defences of peace in the minds of men". These activities have two fun¬
damental aims. The first is to make the right to education a reality for everyone on earth. The
second is to help Unesco's Member States construct and renovate their education systems to meet
the challenges of the 21st century.
WORLDWIDE ACTION FOR EDUCATION
Unesco's work is underpinned by three separate institutes: IBE and HEP deal with comparative
education and educational planning respectively. Lifelong education, literacy and adult education are covered by UIE.
THE INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF EDUCATION
(IBE)
P.O. Box 199, 1211 Geneva 20, Switzerland
Tel. (41 22) 798 14 55
Fax (41 22) 798 14 86
Internet: http://www.unicc.org/ibe
The International Bureau of Education is a
study and information centre in comparative
education. Founded as a private organization in
Geneva in 1925, the IBE became the first inter¬
governmental organization in the field of edu¬
cation in 1929. In 1969, the IBE changed its
status and became an integral part of UNESCO,
while retaining broad intellectual autonomy.
The IBE prepares and organizes the Inter¬
national Conference on Education (ICE), which
is convened every two years in Geneva by the
Director-General of UNESCO. Each session of
the Conference deals with a specific theme and
leads to the adoption of an international recom¬
mendation on that theme addressed to Minis¬
ters of Education worldwide. The forty-fifth
session of the Conference will be held in 1996
on the theme "Strengthening the role of
teachers in a changing world".
The Bureau houses a documentation centre,
which contains more than 100,000 books, docu¬
ments, periodicals and microfiches. There is a
large collection of national reports on educa¬
tional developments and innovations.
The IBE organizes training activities in the
form of a scholars-in-residence programme,
workshops and brief courses on the tech¬
niques of librarianship.
It also publishes education studies and ref¬
erence works, such as the International Year¬
book of Education and the UNESCO: IBE Edu¬
cation Thesaurus, as well as newsletters and
periodicals. UNESCO's quarterly Prospects is the
IBE's main international review of comparative
education.
THE UNESCO INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATION (UIE)

The UNESCO Institute for Education was estab¬
lished in 1951 in Hamburg, Germany. It
focuses on adult and non-formal education
within the framework of lifelong learning, and
specifically on adult literacy and continuing
education. UIE's activities include research,
training and documentation dissemination on a
worldwide scale.
Decisions on programme activities and the
budget are made by the UIE Governing Board
and UNESCO's General Conference. The Insti¬
tute's financial resources are provided by
Unesco, the German government, the author¬
ities of the Hanseatic City of Hamburg and
other funding sources.
Currently, the Institute's main tasks include:
*" collecting and analysing information on
research in the field of adult education. Partic¬
ular attention is given to educational opportuni¬
ties for migrants, minorities and other under¬
privileged communities, to women and literacy;
conducting co-operative research projects
related to non-formal basic education for adults
and out-of-school youth, including projects on
the development of alternative learning
approaches for the latter, the use of mother
tongues and national languages in literacy and
post-literacy work in industrialized countries;
*" strengthening information exchanges and
the extension of networks in the field of adult
and continuing education.
The Institute houses a documentation
centre and a library specializing in literacy and
continuing education, containing over 50,000
publications and documents.
UIE publications include the International
Review of Education, handbooks and refer¬
ence works, studies on literacy in industrialized
countries, reports and a newsletter.
THE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE
FOR EDUCATIONAL PLANNING
(HEP)

The HEP, which was established in 1963, is a
centre for advanced training and research in the
field of educational planning and administra¬
tion. It contributes to the development of edu¬
cation throughout the world, by expanding
knowledge and training professionals. It acts as
a focus for the exchange of ideas and concepts
in educational planning and administration.
It is financed mainly by a UNESCO grant-
in-aid, voluntary contributions from UNESCO
Member States and contract resources.
Training is the cornerstone of IIEP's oper¬
ations. The number of participants in its nine-
month Annual Training Programme has passed
the 1,000 mark, while over 3,100 people have
attended the intensive courses and workshops
which HEP organizes in a number of countries
and sub-regions.
IIEP's research and study programmes are
relevant to UNESCO's main priorities on basic
education for all and human resource develop¬
ment, and lead to the production of training
materials and modules.
Topics covered in the 1990-1995 period
included improvement of the quality of educa¬
tion; access to education for disadvantaged
groups and ways of reducing inequalities; man¬
agement of the transition from school to work;
planning science education for secondary
schools; new trends in technical and vocational
education; institutional management of higher
education as well as educational financing, man¬
agement and administration.
HEP disseminates new technical concepts
in educational planning through a large-scale
programme of publications and documenta¬
tion. Some 700 titles have been published so far.
The HEP Documentation Centre has a
stock of some 37,000 books and documents,
and subscribes to around 500 periodicals
dealing with educational planning and related
subjects.

REGIONAL ACTION
Two regional centres play an important role in the field of
post-secondary education: CRESALC for Latin America
and the Caribbean and CEPES for Europe.
CRESALC

Established in 1978 in Caracas (Venezuela), CRESALC pro¬
motes regional co-operation in higher education and assists
UNESCO Member States in Latin America and the Caribbean
in their efforts to develop and improve national systems of
higher education.
It also promotes the mobility of academic personnel,
serving as the secretariat for the application of the Regional
Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and
Degrees in Higher Education.
CRESALC is closely involved in the implementation of
UNITWIN (see this page). A UNESCO Chair in Human
Rights has been established in co-operation with the national
Council of Universities in Venezuela. It publishes a bi-annual
journal, Revista Educación Superior y Sociedad, and a quar¬
terly bulletin, Boletín CRESALC.
CEPES

The European Centre for Higher Education (CEPES) was
established in Bucharest (Romania) in 1972. It serves as a hub
for the collection and exchange of information and experi¬
ence, a forum and a centre for the promotion of research and
development in UNESCO's European region (which includes
Israel, Turkey and North America).
It is also a focal point for several specialized networks
connected with such issues as higher education research, staff
development and women's studies.
CEPES houses a library and documentation centre which
contains some 27,000 documents. Its capacity for co-opera¬
tion has been enhanced by the setting up of the UNICOM
electronic network.
CEPES publications include a quarterly, Higher Educa¬
tion in Europe (in English, French and Russian).
EDUCATION FOR PEACE
The Associated Schools Project (ASP) -
Since it was launched in 1953 the ASP network has sought to
strengthen the commitment of children and young people to
international understanding and peace.
Participating schools are invited to organize programmes
relating to education pilot projects on one of four main themes:
the study of world problems and the role of the United Nations
system in solving them; human rights; other peoples and their
cultures; the environment.
Associated Schools act as a springboard for the inclusion of
UNESCO's ideals and concerns in school curricula.
As of February 1996 more than 3,638 educational institutions
on all age levels in 129 countries belong to the network, with
numbers increasing every month.

THE REGIONAL PROGRAMMES
Expanding and reforming primary education
and promoting adult education
The building blocks of UNESCO's global action in favour of literacy and education for all are its
regional projects and programmes for literacy: the Major Project in the field of Education in
Latin America and the Caribbean; the Regional Programme for the Eradication of Illiteracy in
Africa; the Asian and Pacific Programme of Education for All; and the Regional Programme
for the Universalization and Renewal of Primary Education and the Eradication of Illiteracy in
the Arab States by the year 2000.
In addition, an information-exchange network based at the UIE facilitates co-operation
between industrialized countries faced with problems of "functional illiteracy", i.e. an inability to
read and write sufficiently well to cope with the challenges of life in complex modern societies.
The regional literacy programmes are based on two fundamental principles: technical co¬
operation between developing countries and the need to combat illiteracy through a global
approach combining the universalization and renewal of primary education with stepped-up
literacy work among out-of-school youth and adults.
All programmes give special attention to the education of women and girls and to literacy
follow-up activities designed to encourage the reading habit.
Progress towards regional goals evidently depends upon the success of national efforts,
but in many countries these efforts are faltering because of the economic crisis which has
severely restricted the development of education.
Fortunately, there is a growing realization that education is the key to development, and
the commitment of the international community has increased since the World Conference
on Education for All held in Jomtien (Thailand) in 1990.

A SPEARHEAD FOR HIGHER
EDUCATION
The UNITWIN/Unesco Chairs Programme
The key objective of this programme
launched in 1991 is to develop a spirit of
solidarity based on twinning, networking
and other linking arrangements among uni¬
versities throughout the world. More
specifically, it is designed to make full use
of North-South and East-West co-opera¬
tion in order to set in motion a process
leading to strong and durable links between
higher education and scientific institutions
worldwide, especially along the South-
South axis.
UNITWIN helps to establish sub-
regional, regional and inter- regional net¬
works of higher education and research
institutions (there are 46 inter-university
networks). The UNESCO Chairs (215 in
over 80 countries) are intended to provide
postgraduate students from the devel¬
oping countries with enhanced opportu¬
nities for advanced training and research
at centres of excellence in key disciplines
related to sustainable development.
Partnerships have been established
with other United Nations agencies, in
particular with the United Nations Uni¬
versity (UNU), inter-governmental orga¬
nizations, development aid agencies,
foundations, industry and non-govern¬
mental organizations in the higher educa¬
tion and scientific fields.

Education for all: making it work
At the World Conference on Education
for All (Jcrnticn, Thailand, 1990) 155
countries pledged to provide basic educa¬
tion for all children and adults.
The search for innovation and fresh
ideas has led UNESCO and UNICEF to
launch a joint project: "Education for All:
Making it Work". The project identifies
the latest innovations in school systems
and practice in Africa, Asia, Latin America
and the Arab states by a continuous on-
thc-ground search using networks and
partners in education ministries, teachers'
associations, the research community and
local educational authorities.
The project provides wide access to
these new ideas in education and shows
how they work, through booklets,
videos, databases, thematic portfolios and
workshops.

COMMENTARY BY FEDERICO MAYOR
1996:
INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR
-3 THE ERADICATION OF POVERTY
For there to be peace, there must be
knowledge and acknowledgment of
others. Peace means lasting respect for
differences; peace means never threatening
tjiat most important possession of all: life itself.
At the" dawn of the third millennium, I call
on each and every one of us to make a public
announcement in the schools, in the worlds of
sport and the arts, in the media and within
government administrations: human life must
no longer be threatened. The act of killing has
no justification and above all no religious vin¬
dication religions are founded on love and
generosity nor can there be any cultural,
nationalistic or ideological justification. If we
really wish to leave a peaceful world to our
children, we must with the greatest firmness
forbid all threats to human life.
values can humanity enjoy peace, peace lived
every day which means happiness.
Dialogue and tolerance are not to be
equated merely with docility and acceptance
of the opinions of others. On the contrary,
dialogue and tolerance mean choosing a new
way of life, a new way of reaching agree¬
ment with no bloodshed, no loss of life, no
violence, none of war's perversity. Dialogue
and tolerance mean pursuing with both deter¬
mination and compassion the non-violent set¬
tlement of conflicts.
Dialogue and tolerance
This is the one essential condition whereby a
culture of war of force, constraint, oppres¬
sion, inequality can be transformed into a
culture of peace. A culture of peace requires:
dialogue, tolerance and awareness of the infi¬
nite diversity of humanity. The ethical values
embodied in UNESCO's Constitution: justice,
freedom, particularly freedom of speech, "the
free flow of ideas by word and image"
equality, solidarity "the intellectual and moral
solidarity of mankind" only through these
Peace and development
There can be no lasting peace without sustain¬
able development, without endogenous devel¬
opment, through the uprooting of frustration,
poverty and exclusion. Only by conferring on
each person the possibility of deciding for him
or herself and thus being in charge of his or
her own destiny can we hope to reduce pop¬
ulation growth, reduce migration, improve the
quality of life in rural settings, understand and
help those who govern to understand that
peace and the environment are the concerns of
each and every one of us.
Sustainable development has one essential
key word: sharing. We should share all
resources starting with knowledge. At both
international and domestic levels, land, finance,
knowledge and know-how are the preserve of

<o TALAMANCA- LA AMISTAD
^r- ru«. v VV£*«
Bestriding Costa Rica and Panama,
the Talamanca-La Amistad Cordillera
is a patchwork of natural parks and
reserves covering more than 800,000
hectares. It was registered on
UNESCO's World Heritage List in 1990
FROILAN ESCOBAR GONZALEZ
is a Cuban journalist who has twice won the National
Critics' Award of Cuba, for his books Marti a flor de
labios ("Marti, On the Tip of the Tongue", 1993) and La
vieja que vuela ("The Old Woman with Wings", 1994).
According to an ancient legend of
the Bribri and Cabecar Indians,
the huge platform formed by the
Cordillera de Talamanca, whose peaks
between Costa Rica and Panama rise to
an altitude of almost 4,000 metres
above sea level, was the site where the
god Sibú decided to set up house and
sow the maize seeds that would give
birth to humankind.
According to this legend, the cre¬
ation took place at the source of the
Lari River in Surayum, where Sibú orga¬
nized great festivities, handing out
lavish quantities of cacao to each person
who had helped him. When they were
over, he brought forward young Iriria,
the Earth, so that she could cover the
rock with her fertile bridal train, and
the world began to turn green. Then
Sibú fell asleep after asking the cuyeo
bird to sin" for him that night.
Science, on the other hand, tells us
that this imposing mountain range rose
up some 30 million years ago. The enor¬
mous pressure exerted by tectonic and
volcanic movements caused uplifts
during the Pliocene epoch which even¬
tually filled in the oceanic basin then
separating North America from South
America, and which took on their pre¬
sent shape about 7 million years ago.
So it was that a narrow strip of land
(its width between the Pacific and
Atlantic Oceans is barely more than 150
km) came into existence and formed a
veritable bridge between two biologically
different continents. The abundance and
variety of its endemic species can be put
down to this genetic convergence of flora
and fauna from two distinct regions.
Others factors include the region's
geographical position and its topograph¬
ical and climatic diversity. The proximity

of the Atlantic and the Pacific tempers
the fierce tropical heat. But variations in
altitude from sea level to the 3,820-
metre-high Mount Chirripo, the
Cordillera's highest point mean that the
climate displays wide temperature dif¬
ferences (from a maximum of 25° C to a
minimum of- 9° C.
A FOREST IN THE CLOUDS
Because of these climatic features and
the richness of its soil, the region offers
a wide palette of different landscapes
and biotopes.
The very humid forest found at trop¬
ical level has a varied, complex and het¬
erogeneous flora, which includes tall
bushy trees covered with epiphytic
plants such as liana, which can grow as
thick as a human torso. Its fauna is
equally varied, and comprises snakes,
deer, felines, vampire and other bats,
capuchin and howler monkeys, tree
frogs, sloths and anteaters. There is also
a huge variety of birds and butterflies

whose colours enliven an impenetrable
environment more luxuriant even than the
jungles imagined by Wifredo Lam or
Douanier Rousseau.
A LILLIPUTIAN LANDSCAPE
Above 3,000 metres, the forest gives
way to a damp and inhospitable zone
known as the páramo. The reddish,
dwarfish vegetation, no more than two
metres in height, found on this shrubby
steppe consists mainly of bamboo,
grasses, ferns and myrtle whose
branches have twisted under the effect
of wind, frost, drizzle and the abrupt
temperature changes characteristic of
this subalpine biotope, which is not
found elsewhere in the region.
This is the point where the range of
many plant species of Andean origin
comes to an end. The fauna includes
two species of bird, lizards, one species
of salamander, insects and spiders
which adapt their activity to tempera¬
ture variations during the day and fall
into a state of lethargy at night to slow
down their metabolism. Certain species
of rodent as well as rabbit are also
found in this area. They are hunted by
forest felines such as the jaguar (Pan¬
thera onca), the ocelot (Felis pardalis),
the tiger cat (Felis tigrina) and the
jaguarundi (Felis eyra).
VALLEYS OF
DESOLATE BEAUTY
The Talamanca-La Amistad reserve is the
only site in Central America where the
Quaternary glaciations left an indelible
mark. The visitor venturing up to the
summits of the mountain range can
observe almost intact glacial forma¬
tions deep U-shaped valleys, moraines,
lakes, cirques which testify to the exis¬
tence of great glaciers during the Pleis¬
tocene epoch some 25,000 years ago.
The many valleys fashioned by the
glaciers have a desolate beauty. They
include the Savannah of the Lions,
named after the mountain lions (Felis
concolor) that live there; the Valley of
the Rabbits, a vast expanse of sand sur¬
rounded by rocky peaks and inhabited
by rabbits; the mysterious Valley of the
Ridges, where the soil's high iron eon-
tent causes magnetic disturbances
which disorientate compass needles;
and the Valley of the Moraines and the
Valley of the Lakes, which are dotted
with some 30 crystalline lakes. It is here
that you may catch a glimpse of Baird's
tapir (Tapirus bairdii) as it swims in one
of these often ice-covered lakes, or as it
races along it is a powerful 200-kg
animal two metres long in an attempt
to escape its main enemy, the jaguar,
one of six big cats found in Talamanca,
but now almost extinct.
A BIRD WORSHIPPED
BY THE AZTECS
The sighting of a quetzal, a bird of leg¬
endary beauty, as it takes off, leaving a
golden-green streak in the air, is a par¬
ticularly rare privilege, since the virgin
forest above 1,200 metres where it lives
is steadily being destroyed.
The bird gets its name from the
Aztecs, who called it quetzaltototl and
worshipped it. They used its feathers
to decorate the god Quetzalcoatl, who
was represented as a feathered serpent.

Two subspecies of the bird are found
in the area between Mexico and Panama,
but only one (Pharomachrus mocinno
costarricensis) inhabits this steep
cordillera. The female lays two eggs in a
nest in the hole of a tree, and takes it in
turns with the male to brood. When quet¬
zals breed, which is twice a year, the male
damages its magnificent plumage by flying
in and out of the nest, and after the young
birds have left the nest it moults and
grows its feathers again.

8. The double-crested harpie eagle preys

9. A puma, cougar or mountain lion, the
largest of the cats found in the Americas.
Another interesting sight is the flight
of hummingbirds, tiny creatures capable
of flying in any direction (including back¬
wards) or remaining in stationary flight as
they gather nectar from flowers. Their
wings beat sixty times a second and their
heart up to 1,440 times a minute. One of
the most picturesque of these birds is the
fire-breasted hummingbird (Panterpe
insignis), which is endemic to the high
areas in this region. It is 11 cm long and
weighs 5.7 g.
Avery different sight is the majestic
flight of the harpy eagle (Harpia
harpyja), which is in danger of
becoming extinct because of the exces¬
sive use of pesticides and uncontrolled
deforestation.
But these are only a few of the 600
bird species that have been identified
in the Talamanca cordillera (as many as
all those found in North America).
SIBÚ'S CHILDBEN
In addition to its natural wonders, the
region contains a great many archaeolog¬
ical remains. Over 200 sites have been dis¬
covered (tombs, stone columns, petro-
glyphs) which cover more than 12,000
years of history, from the preceramic
period to the tribal societies encountered
by Europeans in the sixteenth century.
Study of them will reveal more informa¬
tion about the pre-Columbian cultures of
the region and the links between Meso-
American and South American cultures.
The indigenous peoples of Panama,
the Guaymi and Teribe, like those of
Costa Rica, the Bribri and Cabecar, are
descended from tribes which peopled
the valleys of Central America's mountain
ranges at the time of the Spanish con¬
quest. Despite being in contact with "civ¬
ilization" for almost five centuries, they
have managed to preserve their language,
beliefs and lifestyle. They have a thor¬
ough and detailed knowledge of natural
resources and have succeeded in
exploiting them through farming (maize,
haricot beans, bananas, rice), an activity
which they pursue in conjunction with
hunting and fishing without endangering
the region's ecological balance.
These indigenous communities,
which number about 10,000 people,
currently live in reserves. They not only
suffer from high mortality, mulnutrition
and illiteracy, they are also threatened
by the considerable pressure put on the
ecosystem by the activities of farmers
and ranchers, who are moving closer and
closer to their territories. M

FRANCE BEQUETTE
¡s a Franco-American
journalist
specializing in
environmental
questions.
In the aftermath of the explosion
of reactor no. 4 at the Chernobyl
(Ukraine) nuclear power plant on
26 April 1986, more than 4 million
people living in Belarus, Ukraine
and Russia were exposed to radia¬
tion. "The Chernobyl disaster is
now recognized as having been the
greatest technological catastrophe
in human history," writes Belaru-
sian geneticist V. K. Savchenko in
his recently published study The
Ecology of the Chernobyl Cata¬
strophe (see bibliography at end of
article).
More than 1.7 million persons
are estimated to have been exposed
to higher than normal levels of radi¬
ation; 850,000 of them still live in
the contaminated areas, and
280,000 should be relocated but
have nowhere to go. For ten days on
end burning graphite in the reactor
spewed radioactive gas and aerosol
particles into the atmosphere.
Nearly 50 million curies1 in all, or
77 kilograms of various radioactive
substances (the most lethal being
iodine-131, caesium-134 and -137,
stronlium-90 and pIutonium-239),
were cast over extensive distances
(from 300 to 400 kilometres),
while lighter air-borne particles
drifted to countries as far away as
the United States, India and
Kuweit.
'HALF-LIFE' WORSE
THAN 'NO-LIFE'
The full impact of the ecological
disaster can be measured by
studying the half-life2 of iodine-
131 (8 days), caesium-134 (8 days),
strontium-90 (28 days), caesium-
137 (30 days) and plutonium-239
(24,100 years!). The half-life of a
substance has to be multiplied by
an average of 10 or 15 to under
stand how long it will take for
radioactive substances to disappear
entirely from the environment.
Despite its short half-life,
iodine-131 is the most harmful ele¬
ment for the moment. The human
organism needs iodine, but unfor¬
tunately it does not distinguish
between the stable clement and the
radioactive one. Merely inhaled or
lodged in the food chain, it settles
in the thyroid gland where it can
cause cancer. Children and babies
arc especially vulnerable.
Because of their high solubility,
caesium-137 and strontium-90 are
the principal culprits in contami¬
nating soil and plants, which they
enter via the root-system. Concen¬
trated in the food chain, they settle
in the muscles (caesium-137) and
on bone surfaces (strontium-90).
Strontium-90 replaces calcium in
the bone marrow, thereby opening

the door to blood diseases such as
anaemia and leukemia.
Plutonium is, however, the most
dangerous element by far (the
intake of a single microgram is
lethal to human beings). The heav¬
iest of the elements released by
Chernobyl, it is not easily absorbed
by plants and is radioactive only
over a short distance. Its fallout
was minimal and affected the
immediate vicinity of the power
station, an area thereby condemned
to several tens of thousands of years
of dangerous sterility.
SURVIVING IN THE
CONTAMINATED AREAS
The disaster's ecological effects
apart from the harm done to human
life are still largely unknown.
Grassy plains and fields and flat, bare
ground are the kinds of terrain that
are most seriously contaminated.
Some 144,000 hectares of agricul¬
tural land and 492,000 hectares of
forest have 'been withdrawn from
normal use over a long period.
Radionuclides concentrated in the
sediment at the bottom of standing
water (lakes, swamps, reservoirs and
the like), are absorbed by animal and
plant life. In the forest radioactivity
concentrates in tree bark, moss,
lichen and mushrooms and in leaves
and pine needles, which contaminate
the soil when they fall to the ground.
In some areas it is forbidden to
gather firewood. When burned, the
wood contaminates ovens, and its ash
used as fertilizer contaminates soil
and crops.
A lot of pastureland is unusable.
Forage from the wet plains, which
is extremely contaminated, can only-
he used as a last resort. Dairy prod¬
ucts must not be consumed before
being specially processed. Around
Chernobyl milk is used as an indi¬
cator of the contamination level;
when milk is acceptable for con¬
sumption, other products from the
same farm can also be consumed.
In response to the thousand and
one questions asked by the stricken
populations, Belarus has produced
a 55-page booklet entitled Radia¬
tion: How to Survive in the Radia¬
tion Contaminated Areas. Potatoes
and grain crops are the food crops
least prone to contamination.
Among fruit and berries red and
black currants are more liable to
contamination than apples and
pears. The booklet strongly urges
people who grow their own produce
to use mineral (phosphorus and
potassium) and organic (manure,
guano and humus) fertilizers in
their gardens and orchards because
these seem to prevent the plants
from absorbing radionuclides.
The booklet gives a lot of down-
to-earth advice on the best
methods for washing, cooking and
preserving food. Salting and mari¬
nating meat, for example, is one of
the best ways to rid it of caesium-
137, which stays in the brine. Gen¬
erally speaking, poultry and cattle
may be consumed if they have been
penned in and fed only uncontami-
nated (imported) food for a month
or a month and a half before being
slaughtered. Meat and animal by¬
products must undergo a radiolog¬
ical test. A network of labs and
monitoring centres has been devel¬
oped for this purpose.
It is strongly recommended to
keep houses dust-free, to leave
working clothes outdoors, to wash
often with soap, not to wash clothes
in rainwater, to wear face-masks for

certain activities, to drink plenty of
diuretic and laxative infusions and
eat food rich in protein, vitamins
and mineral salts in order to
strengthen the body's defences. It
takes several months for the human
body to eliminate caesium.
MENTAL HARDSHIP
Obeying this advice is unfortunately
not possible for the 400,000 dis¬
placed persons who are now penni¬
less and jobless in a region they do
not know. They are tortured by the
fear that they are harbouring some
terrible disease caused by radiation.
Is their pessimism justified? Are
they right to fear the worst?
UNESCO'S CHERNOBYL PROGRAMME
Unesco has an ongoing programme to aid the countries
affected by the Chernobyl disaster by means of operations to
remedy its consequences and to promote economic and social
development in the areas concerned.
Twenty-nine Unesco Member States are taking part in the
programme, which has some 150 full-time employees working
in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The programme's financial
resources currently amount to more than $9 million.
In consultation with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, Unesco
has proposed more than 70 projects in its fields of compe¬
tence (education, science, culture, communication and social
science), some thirty of which are underway or have already
been completed.
Nine community development centres for social and psy¬
chological rehabilitation have been set up in the worst-hit com¬
munities. Since they were opened in 1993, they have received
nearly 160,000 visitors, the vast majority of whom have been
children (90,000) and young adults (almost 40,000).
Teaching materials on the themes of energy, the environ¬
ment and development incorporate lessons learned from the
Chernobyl disaster and highlight alternative energy sources.

To help Chernobyl victims cope
with psychological and social disor¬
ders triggered by the disaster, since
1991 UNESCO has opened nine com¬
munity centres for children and
adults in the resettlement areas
near the stricken region. A World
Health Organization (WHO) Con¬
ference on the health consequences
of Chernobyl, held in November
1995, noted that the increase in
psychological problems has been
accompanied by a marked rise in
thyroid cancer in children under-
fifteen in Belarus, (a thirty-fold rise
since 1986), and in Ukraine, where
the numbers of such eases have
increased at least ten-fold.
Scientists believe that the rates
of leukemia and other blood ail¬
ments, as well as breast cancer,
bladder cancer and kidney diseases
could also increase over the next
few years. Studies carried out in
Japan ten years after the atomic
bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki showed a sharp rise in the
incidence of these diseases.
Although preliminary reports on
the state of health of the workers
(some 600,000 "liquidators")
brought to Chernobyl in the first
weeks after the accident show no
increase in death-rates, they do
reveal a big jump in the incidence
of common ailments, a high rate of
neuropsychological disorders and
premature aging.
GLACIERS: NATURE'S ARCHIVES
OF NUCLEAR ACTIVITY
The psycho-social effects experi¬
enced by the affected populations
were singled out for priority at the
WHO conference. "In particular,"
noted Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima,
Director-General of WHO, "these
have included anxiety over the pos¬
sible ill effects of radiation on their
health in the long term. Originally,
much fear and mistrust had
occurred because of the lack of
information immediately after the
accident, which caused many psy¬
chosomatic disorders". Headaches,
chest pains, intestinal disorders,
sleep disturbance, loss of concentra¬
tion, and alcohol abuse are common¬
place. Similar psycho-social effects
can be observed in the wake of
earthquakes, fires, floods and other
natural and man-made disasters.
According to psychologist Lubow
Ilorich, co-ordinator of the nine
rehabilitation centres, "People . . .
continue to be suspicious of most
information available". Fact-gath¬
ering in the nuclear field is hard;
tempers flare quickly; fact and fic¬
tion intertwine. Some people
believe, for example, that radioac¬
tive contamination is contagious;
others believe that red wine and
vodka neutralize radiation!
Chernobyl is the eighth nuclear
accident of which glaciologists have
found undeniable traces in glaciers.
Glaciers have also recorded all the
atmospheric nuclear tests carried
out by the major powers between
1954 and 1963. Snow and ice
imprison all radioactive elements
carried by air currents. Moreover, it
is impossible to confuse natural and
artificial radionuclides. Radioactive
fallout acts as a reference level for
glaciologists, enabling the different
layers of snow to be accurately
dated. This means that it is futile to
try to hide or minimize the facts:
nuclear safety goes far beyond mere
national boundaries.
1. Curio (Ci): a classical unit of
radioactivity equal lo .'i7 billion
becquerels; 1 becquerel (lîq) is a unit of
radioactivity equal to the disintegration of
one radionuclide per second.

decrease by half in the activity of a

In virtually every city in the world, wedges of land are used for
vegetable gardens. New York City, for example, has more than
1,000 community gardens, and Berlin some 80,000. In the
developing world, urban farming is a source of income for about
100 million people, and a food source for nearly half a billion.
The most comprehensive global research on urban food pro¬
duction to date has been conducted by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) with assistance from The
Urban Agriculture Network (TUAN), which Is based in Washington
D.C. TUAN has documented urban farming practices in more
than 20 countries In Asia, Africa and Latin America and has dis¬
covered that between 25 and 75 per cent of urban families world¬
wide are engaged in food production at least part of the time.
Farmers in 18 of China's largest cities meet 85 per cent of the
urban demand for vegetables and more than half the demand for
meat. In the United States farms in metropolitan areas account
for more than a third of all crop and livestock sales. In Java,
urban home gardens supply an estimated 18 per cent of the
calories and 14 per cent of the protein consumed in the island's
cities. Some 20 per cent of the food needs of Buenos Aires are
met by urban gardens. It is generally estimated that these prod¬
ucts are from 30 to 60 per cent richer in micro-nutrients than
those found In supermarket stock.
Community gardens are also the ¡deal place for recycling
sewage and solid waste. But air pollution is a problem: food
grown along roadsides can be contaminated by lead from
exhaust emissions. When the air is polluted, it Is better to
grow tomatoes and fruit rather than lettuce. It would appear,
nonetheless, that lettuce concentrates less lead If ¡t grows In
soil with a high content of rubbish-based compost.
In the poor neighbourhood of Jerusalén, in the southern
suburb of Bogota, a local non-governmental organization (Las
Gaviotas) uses hydroponic techniques, i.e. growing is done
either in a 15-centimetre-deep mixture of rice husks and coal
chips or entirely in water. With support from the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) over 100 people learned to
grow high-quality vegetables on rooftops and in other unused
spaces. The crops provide families with additional income and
fresh vegetables. Even the local school has Its own rooftop veg¬
etable patch, where students and neighbourhood inhabitants
take courses in hydroponic agriculture.

VANUATU, THE LAND
OF FRUIT TREES
There are some 40 species of fruit and nut trees in
Melanesia's Vanuatu Islands. Some are endemic,
while others were introduced by the first migrants
more than 2,000 years ago. It is now hard to dis¬
tinguish endemic from Imported species. Yet a very
rare variety of the sapotaceae (Burckella) family,
mentioned for the first time in 1892, has never been
seen elsewhere. The copious amounts of fruit and
nuts harvested from the wild and cultivated trees
are an important and much-appreciated addition to
the local diet. According to France's Institute of Sci¬
entific Research for Development through Co-oper¬
ation (ORSTOM), arboriculture may have been
invented in Melanesia, an important region for the
diversification of fruit-tree species.
LAND DEGRADATION
Degradation of the world's agricultural land Is
increasing, reports the Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization of the United Nations (FAO). Some 305 mil¬
lion hectares have already been destroyed by
human activity, and In the next 20 years another
140 million hectares (an area equivalent to almost
half the surface of Western Europe) will lose much
of their value as farmland. Degradation Is most wide¬
spread in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The situa¬
tion is particularly serious in Africa, where only a
quarter of cropland was used in 1990, because
farmers lack the means to replace lost soil-
enrichening substances with fertilizers. Soil is a rare
and non-renewable resource, and a mere 11 per cent
of the earth's land surface can be used unrestrict¬
edly for farming.
NEW FROM UNESCO
In collaboration with the United Nations Develop¬
ment Programme (UNDP), Unesco's International
Environmental Education Programme has recently
published three modules for students and
teachers: Freshwater Resources, Biological Diversity
and Global Change. So far they are available in Eng¬
lish only. For further information, please contact:

COLOURFUL RICE
The colours of plants, a phenomenon linked to their
genetic diversity, is determined by the wave-length
of the sun's rays that they absorb during photo¬
synthesis. In the last ten years a Chinese agrono¬
mist from Zhejiang, Li Mlnzheng, has developed
some 120 varieties of coloured rice, ranging from
black and green to red, yellow and purple. Flowers
are a striking example of the coloration process, but
it also applies to plants such as cotton, of which,
oddly enough, only the white variety is cultivated.
The production of coloured cotton would reduce
dependence on chemical pigments, a major source
of water pollution.
ANCIENT CAVE-DWELLERS
American and Romanian researchers have discovered
33 hitherto unknown animal species in the pitch dark¬
ness that has reigned for 5.5 million years at the
bottom of the Movile cave on the shores of the
Black Sea. The finds include spiders, a centipede, ter¬
restrial isopods, a leech and an unusual little insect
called a water scorpion. Biologist Thomas Kane sur¬
mises that these creatures lived in a tropical climate
and that they fled to the cave during a big climatic
upheaval. Deprived of sun, thus of photosynthesis,
like the animals living at the bottom of the sea, these
small sightless organisms derive their energy from
the oxidation of hydrogen sulphide dissolved in the
water. According to the team's microbiologist, Brian
Klnkle, no other cave In the world contains so many
interdependent species. Moreover the similarity of
conditions enables researchers to carry out experi¬
ments that would be impossible or too costly in the
ocean depths.
FOR THE LOVE OF PEAT
Peat bogs are the result of a long process that
began with the retreat of the glaciers some 12,000
years ago. They form in temperate humid climates
by an accumulation and partial decomposition of
vegetable remains under conditions of poor
drainage. Immersion excludes air and prevents com¬
plete decay. The peat layer may be several metres
thick in places. When drained, shallow peat bogs
can become very fertile soil, and thick layers of peat
provide fuel. But to destroy peat bogs Is to plunder
a heritage that has taken thousands of years to
form and is valuable because it sustains unique
plant- and animal-life and is our main source of infor¬
mation on the flora and climatic conditions of the
Quaternary era. Bogs in Denmark and Germany have
even delivered up 700 excellently preserved bodies
of our Bronze- and Iron-Age ancestors.
LONG LIVE THE COELACANTH
When requested by the Fondation Nicolas Hulot in
France and Germany's Max Planck Institute, biolo¬
gists Hans Frlcke and Raphael Plante travelled in
November 1995 to the Comoro Islands in the Indian
Ocean to assess the status of the last surviving
coelacanths [Latimeria chalumnae). A living fossil
that was thought to have disappeared at the end of
the Cretaceous period, this deep-sea fish was dis¬
covered alive and well in 1938. Today only some 150
are left. A number of International organizations
have joined forces to try to prevent the extinction
of this fish that cannot be kept in captivity.
KEEPING TABS ON TUNA
Researchers at France's Institute of Scientific
Research for Development through Co-operation
(ORSTOM) are following the movements of tuna
fish via tiny emitters fitted with temperature and
depth sensors attached to the fishes' backs. They
have discovered that the tuna, a migratory fish, has
a strong sense of direction, but do not yet know
how the fish can find Its way so accurately in an
environment which seems to be so lacking in "land¬
marks". When computerized, data on the tuna's
movements could not only lead fishermen to fish-
abundant waters but also regulate access to them
so as to prevent over-flshlng. Another bad-
news/good-news story for fish.

A mere $13 dollars is all it takes
to protect a child from the six
most deadly diseases (diph¬
theria, measles, whooping cough,
poliomyelitis, tetanus and tuber¬
culosis). It costs $150 to equip a
well that provides a family with
drinking water. To provide a pri¬
mary school with a year's sup¬
plies costs $957. Amazingly
small sums can help to solve most
of the health, nutrition and edu¬
cational problems faced by the
world's children.
Measles alone kills a million
children each year. In the devel¬
oping countries one child out of
three goes hungry. Almost 10
per cent of the world's children
die before turning five. The toll
of wars and conflicts adds to this
grim litany: one and a half mil¬
lion children killed in the last
decade, four million maimed
and twelve million left homeless.
Yet the world has the tech¬
nological and financial resources
to palliate much of this suf¬
fering, if not eradicate it
entirely. Many developing coun¬
tries have succeeded in
reducing the malnutrition rate
to 10 per cent of the child pop¬
ulation: 17 countries have taken
nationwide steps to eliminate
vitamin A deficiency, which
leads to blindness; 20 countries
iodize more than 75 per cent of
their salt. Since the United
Nations World Summit for Chil¬
dren held in New York in Sep¬
tember 1990, 158 countries
have officially committed them¬
selves to attaining the goals set
on that occasion for the year
2000.

1 CONVENT»^	ï
The International Convention on
the Rights of the Child, which
was unanimously adopted by
the United Nations General
Assembly in 1989, has been rat¬
ified by 187 countries, an
unprecedented figure in the his¬
tory of human-rights-related
treaties. Only five UN Member
States have not yet ratified it.
The Convention is the first
international treaty to combine
civil and political rights with eco¬
nomic, social and cultural rights.
Signatory countries agree to halt
child slavery, protect children
from sexual abuse and give them
the possibility of speaking out
and being heard. The Convention
contains 54 articles covering
rights to education, nutrition,
primary health care and leisure
time. Many countries have
changed their domestic law to
bring it into line with this inter¬
national legal document.

Fifteen million human beings
are now HIV-positive. One and a
half million of them are chil¬
dren. For babies the risk of Aids
is linked to the presence of the
II IV virus in the mother. An
adult can remain IllV-posilive
for more than ten years, but the
length of time before the dis¬
ease reaches its final stage is
considerably less in a small
organism that has not had time
to develo]) its system of defence.
Third World children are
the worst affected: 80 per cent
of infected children die before
the age of five, but half of them
do not reach age 2. The figures
are much less dramatic in the
industrialized countries, where
HIV-positive pregnant women
receive follow-up medical care.
The prospects for developing
a vaccine are still remote. For
the moment the struggle against
Aids depends largely on edu¬
cating for responsible sexual
behaviour. Most countries that
have taken action via sex educa¬
tion through school programmes
and the media (pop music, the¬
atre, radio and television), have
made some headway. Where
active promotion of condom use
has been accompanied by an
effective campaign against sex¬
ually transmitted diseases, the
incidence of IIIV has dropped
by about 50 per cent.

fi> jssa nova,
Isabelle Leymarie talks to
JOCELYNE BEROARD
singer with the zouk group KASSAV
How did you get into music?
Jocelyne Bernard: My parents loved
music and had pretty eclectic tastes, like
many people in the West Indies. My
brothers and I listened to everything:
opera, jazz, bossa nova, Myriam Makeba,
Edith Piaf. . . . My mother played tangos
and béguines on the piano. Wc listened to
her religiously. But I particularly liked
the songs with words. I studied classical
piano for seven years, but I was lazy; I
would have liked to know how to play
without having to work at it. My brothers
studied the piano too, then one of them
started in on the drums and another on
the guitar. One of them composed and
played béguines and jazz on the piano,
and once in a while I would sing with him
for the fun of it.
How did you get started?
J. B.: The first time I sang in public was
quite spontaneous, at the year-end fes¬
tivities at my high school. I sang a song
I liked the tunc of; in creóle it was
called Maman, la grèv bare moin
("Mom, the strike blocked my way"). It
was a kind of protest song. Strikes
weren't very popular at the time in Mar¬
tinique. I didn't realize it then, but my
mother and teachers were very upset.
Later I settled in Paris, and one of my
brothers introduced me to the music
scene. I worked with several groups
before joining Kassav'.
What kind of music did people
listen to in the Antillesthe French-
speaking West Indieswhen you
were a teenager?
J. B.: Mini-jazz or the compas, styles
that came from Haiti and were imitated
by all the local groups; túmbele too, a
48
Zaire beat imported by the African band
Rico Jazz. Other groups played calypso.
There was even a group that did Otis
Redding slows, imitating his voice with
an awful American accent! And of course
older rhythms like the tango, the
mazurka or the creóle waltz. Rut this
kind of music is no longer played at
young people's zonks (dances) nowadays.
Where does the zouk come from?
J. B.: In the Antilles you first had the
traditional styles of African origin, born
at the time of slavery the belair and
other drum rhythms, as well as music
played by slaves to imitate their mas¬
ters, like the quadrille. . . .
What about city music like the
Saint-Pierre beguine?
J. B.: Far be it from me to put down the
beguine I love it but that's not all
you hear nowadays. While other
Caribbean and Latin American countries
were honing their own styles, music in
the Antilles stagnated, simply copying
salsa, calypso, jazz, the Dominican beat
and other foreign rhythms. Then Pierre-
Edouard Décimus, Georges Décimus
and Jacob Desvarieux, the core of the
Kassav' group, started thinking about
the weaknesses of Antillean music. The
inspiration was there, but the record¬
ings were poorly produced, poorly bal¬
anced and technically defective. What's
more, most of the musicians were self-
taught, and talented though they were,
they needed time to acquire certain
skills. The Antilles still suffer from a
lack of top-flight music schools and con¬
servatories. So Pierre-Edouard decided
to form a really professional group with
a typically Antillean style that corre
sponded to our temperament, and to
concentrate particularly on making
recordings and performing on stage.
With its innovative arrangements
based on traditional rhythms, zouk
has managed to unify Guadeloupe and
Martinique, musically speaking	
J. B.: Yes, maybe because Kassav' was
created in Paris, where the Décimus
brothers and Jacob Desvarieux, who all
come from Guadeloupe, were living at
the time. They wanted to play with the
best Antillean session musicians and so
they joined forces with musicians from
Martinique. Kassav' came out of that
encounter. Some Martiniquans ask me
occasionally why I use words from
Guadcloupian créole, but that's part of
my personal contribution to the group.
Does the use of creóle make it
more difficult for this music to get
an international hearing?
J. B.: No. A lot of people including
me don't understand everything
Michael Jackson sings. Rut that doesn't
stop him from being a hit in non-English-
speaking countries. Our music is strong
enough in itself to reach audiences of
different nationalities. You just have to
know how to listen.
In which countries, apart from
those of the Caribbean, is Kassav'
most successful?
J. B.: In Africa. Throughout the French
and Portuguese-speaking regions of
Africa. Angolan music, for example, is
close to the music of the Antilles, and at
one time the music of the Cape Verde
Islands was inlluenccd by zouk. Some
Cape Verde momas are reminiscent of

invented zouk (from mazouk or mazurka, a
creóle uord meaning a village dance), a musical
genre that now has fans in many parts of the
world. The group recently made a recording
entitled Difé1, featuring Stevie Wonder and Ray
Barreño as guest artistes. Left, Jocelyne Bernard

slow béguines. Rut even in New York,
where we played at the Africa Fest, or
in Japan and Russia, the audience gets
swept up in the joie de vivre of our music.
In New York we had the Haitians
jumping for joy.
Are the different islands in the
Caribbean receptive to one another?
J. B.: If you listen closely, all their music
is similar. All you have to do is slow down
some rhythms and you recognize others.
Jamaican ragga isn't very far from zouk;
nor is bossa nova. I don't think it is pos¬
sible to invent a new rhythm these days.
It's become a matter of combining
rhythms and making arrangements.
Are the words very important for
your fans?
J. B.: Yes, because people who like a
song, like to sing it. When we perform in
the Antilles, the audience sings along
with us. The same thing happens in
Africa; the people don't speak creóle,
but they learn the words phonetically.
That's why it's important not to write
just any old thing.
How does the group get its ideas?
J. B.: Everyone brings along their own com¬
positions. Sometimes they are greeted
enthusiastically, sometimes they're criti
cized pretty severely. We work as a group,
though, even when we're doing arrange¬
ments. Everyone makes a contribution,
and we talk it all through.
Whereas calypso and other forms
of Caribbean music have long
reflected the rivalry between the
sexes, your lyrics are more
conciliatory. Do women in the
Antilles today express their
sensuality more freely than before?
J. B.: Certainly. Even just a short time
ago it was rare in traditional songs for
women to present themselves as "mata¬
dors". All they did was cry over lost
love. A woman who sang late at night at
dances and hung out until all hours
with musicians was looked down on. In
the West Indies there are still men who
don't think much of women. But if I
tease men in my songs and try to make
them understand certain problems, it's
because I want to promote a better
understanding between men and
women. I always try to bring hope and
not to dwell on the negative side of life,
even in the greatest distress. Even in a
small way, it's better to contribute to
happiness and peace in the world,
heartbreaking though it is to see how
violence is spreading everywhere.
Through music we can say what other
people do not always dare to express
but we have no right to fan the flames
of hatred.
Do you agree with certain
Antillean musicians who say that
zouk today is too commercial?
J. B.: Antillean music is in an awkward
position. Many "fake" groups con¬
sisting of a single person playing and
composing on a computer have recently
appeared on the scene, and the public
has heard a lot of mediocre stuff. When
we began, Kassav' disks flooded the
market. The craze, for our disks and
zouk in general was incredible. When
people saw that the formula was suc¬
cessful, everybody jumped on the band¬
wagon. Today the public is spoiled for
choice, but Kassav' still leads the field
for this kind of music. The flame dies
down if we go a long time without
recording, but it comes back to life as
soon as we bring out a quality disc. A lot
of instrumentalists and singers admit
that they wait for a Kassav' recording to
come out and bring them inspiration. H

The rarest, most precious vital force
by Marie Curie
This text by Marie Curie (1867-1934), who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903 and was sole winner
of the 1911 Nobel Prize for Chemistry, is the preamble to a memorandum on international scholarships for
the advancement of science which she presented in Geneva in 1926 as a member of the Committee on
Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations.
IL
I shall devote but few words to an affirmation of faith in
the importance of science for mankind. If at times this
importance has been questioned and if the words "the
failure of science" have been pronounced in moments of
bitter discouragement, it is because man's endeavours to
achieve his highest aspirations are never perfect, like
all that is human, and because these endeavours have
too often been diverted from their path by forces of ego¬
centric nationalism and social regression.
Yet it is through the constant effort to expand sci¬
ence that man has risen to his present pre-eminent place
on our planet and that he is also winning increasing
power over nature and a larger measure of well-being.
We should join with those who, like Rodin, pay homage
to the devoted efforts of scholars and thinkers and with
those who, like Pasteur, "believe indomitably that sci¬
ence and peace will triumph over ignorance and war".
If, to judge from the experience of the recent world
conflict, the aspirations of the elites in different lands
often appear less exalted than those of the great mass of
less well educated persons, it is because of the perils
inherent in all forms of intellectual and political power
when these are not controlled and channeled toward the
high ideals which alone justify their use. No enterprise
can therefore have greater importance than those which
seek to promote international ties between the dynamic
thinkers in all countries and especially between the
young in whose hands lies the future of mankind.
I am sure that no one will deny that even in the most
democratic of countries existing social systems offer a
considerable advantage to the wealthy and that the
roads to higher education, open so freely to children of
families with ample means, are still difficult of access to
children of families with limited resources.
As a result every nation each year loses a large part of
the rarest, most precious vital force. While waiting for
reforms in education to resolve this problem once and
for all, the democratic response in various countries has
hitherto consisted of a partial remedy, the creation of
national educational scholarships, thus enabling higher
education to retrieve some of the young people of whom
it would otherwise he deprived.
These national efforts, highly commendable though
still far from adequate, are not our concern here, but I
would like to point out that the same problem exists
with regard to post-university studies for the young
people who have managed to surmount all the obstacles
encountered up to that point.
At this post-university stage of their lives, young stu¬
dents who contemplate careers in science are brought face
to face with pressing demands. In most cases the family
has done its utmost to help the young man or woman to
come this far and, unable to make further sacrifices, it
now asks them to become self supporting. And even in well-
to-do families the wish to take up very advanced studies
may encounter a lack of understanding, such studies being
considered as an extravagance or a mere whim.
Yet what in fact are the best interests of society in
this matter? Should it not give every encouragement to
those called to a scientific vocation? Is it really so well-
endowed that it can afford to reject the vocations it is
offered?
I believe, on the basis of personal experience, that
the sum total of the aptitudes called for by a true sci¬
entific vocation is an infinitely frail and precious thing, a
rare treasure that it is both absurd and criminal to
throw away, a gift to which great care must be devoted
so that it may grow and fructify.
What, in reality, are some of the qualities required
of the person who aspires to success in the field of inde¬
pendent scientific research? The intellectual qualities
are an intelligence capable of learning and under¬
standing; a sure judgment capable of appraising the sig¬
nificance of theoretical and experimental demonstra¬
tions, an imagination capable of creative effort. Equally
important are the moral faculties: perseverance, zeal
and above all the unselfish dedication that guides the
novice along a path which, inmost cases, will never lead
him to material rewards comparable to those offered
by careers in industry or business.
Thus to foster and safeguard the scientific vocation is a
sacred duty for each society which has the interests of its
future at heart. It is gratifying to sec that public opinion
is becoming increasingly conscious of this duty. I

ARNING: THE TREASURE WITHIN
PORT TO UNESCO OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON EDUCATION FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
Unesco Publishing, 266 pages, Paris, 1996, 150 French Francs
This report is the result of a three-year process of consultation and analysis carried out by a distinguished panel of
specialists chaired by Jacques Delors, former President of the European Commission.
It is a thought-provoking book that proposes ideas that go far beyond mere educational reform. It examines
the place and functions of education in relation to individual achievement and social development in a changing
world.
The report closes with a strong plea for more resources to be devoted to education, both nationally and inter¬
nationally, and for strengthening international co-operation in education, with Unesco as a key player.
