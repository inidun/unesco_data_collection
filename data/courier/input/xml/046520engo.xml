Mask with half moon eyes
The face of this African mask is reduced essentially to the eyes, shaped like half moons with slits
and set on white oval backgrounds. It is a ceremonial mask of the Bembe (or Wabembe) people
of north-east Zaire, near Lake Tanganyika. Like most other African peoples, the Bembe use a great
variety of masks for initiation ceremonies and other rituals.

An Italian archaeological mission,
working in Syria in collaboration with
the Syrian Arab Republic's Department
of Antiquities, has discovered the site
of Ebla, an ancient metropolis whose
location was completely unknown.
The excavations have thrown new light
on the history of Syria 4,000 years ago,
since archaeologists have' also unearthed
the city's archives, written in an
unknown language that is now being
deciphered. Professor Paolo Matthiae,
who directed the excavations, describes
the extraordinary finds in an article
specially written for the Unesco Courier
(published on page 6). Cover shows
detail of a lustral bowl from Ebla:
a double frieze depicting warriors
and lions. (See also page 7.)

<![CDATA[
During a ceremony which took place
on 10 January 1977 at the Acropolis
in Athens. Mr Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
Director-General of Unesco, (below,
with Mr Constantine Trypanis, Greek
Minister of Culture and the Sciences),
launched an appeal for an international
campaign to save the monuments of
the historic Acropolis site which have
seriously deteriorated in the past few
years. We publish here the text
of the appeal.
The Greek government has already taken
important measures to help preserve
the threatened buildings and statues.
Castings have been made of the
Caryatids, for instance, with a view
to removing them to a national museum
until a solution can be found for the
problem of stone disease.
In addition to damage from water
and frost, from the rusting of metal
construction frames, from erosion
and from the consequences of intensive
tourism, the Acropolis is now suffering
from the terrible effects of atmospheric
pollution on stone.
The magnitude, complexity and urgency
of the problem has led to the drawing
up, at the request of the Greek
authorities and in collaboration with
them, of a plan of action to be carried
out within the framework of an
international campaign approved by the
Unesco General Conference at its
last session in Nairobi (Kenya) in
October-November 1976. The goal
is to preserve a great cultural heritage
which, although essentially Greek, is
nevertheless the concern of all mankind.
According to joint Greek-Unesco
estimates the operation will cost
$ 15 million and take between five
and ten years to complete.
The "Unesco Courier" intends to devote
a future issue to the history of the
Acropolis and the problems posed
by its preservation.
To enable readers to respond to this appeal
we publish on page 34 details of how and
where to send contributions.
THE ACROPOLIS IN DANGER
An appeal by the Director-General
of Unesco
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
The Acropolis is in danger...
After resisting the onslaughts of weather and
human assailants for 2,400 years, this magnificent
monument, on which Ictinos and Phidias left the
imprint of their genius, is threatened with destruction
as a result of the damage which industrial civiliza¬
tion has increasingly inflicted on it for a number of
years past.
So far, thanks to the restoration work carried out
since the 19th century by the Greek Department of
Archaeology, supplemented more recently by special
conservation measures, the three million or so visitors
who now throng to the Acropolis each year have still
been able to admire, in the splendour of the incompa¬
rable Attic light, the glorious testimony to that excel¬
lence which characterized the Golden Age of Pericles
and which has remained, throughout the centuries,
for so many countries of the world, a unique source
of inspiration in the field of art and thought.
Today, however, the dilapidation has reached such
proportions that the temples, sculptures and foun¬
dations can no longer be preserved unless a vast
and complex programme- of conservation work is
put in hand without delay. From the technical and
scientific point of view, this calls for detailed studies,
for which it would be difficult for the Greek Govern¬
ment to accept sole responsibility, despite all it is
doing already.
Some of the damage is caused by water seeping

into the cracks and by frost. Elsewhere, the marble
is splitting because of the rusting of the iron bars
and ties used in the past to keep the stones safely
in position. Steps, pavements and rock are being
worn away by the feet of countless visitors. But
to all this has been added another cause of damage,
far more serious even than these. This is atmo¬
spheric pollution, the price we pay for industrial
progress, which is causing the rapid deterioration of
the stone by the action of factory gases and smoke
from domestic hearths.
Until such time as a suitable zone of purified air
can be established round the Acropolis, simultaneous
action is needed so that on-the-spot protection can
be provided for whatever sculptures can be so pre¬
served, so that the remainder can be removed and
transferred to the Acropolis Museum, being replaced
for the time being with plaster-casts, and so that
rusting trusses can be replaced with a non-rusting
alloy, improved paths and intersections provided in
order to channel the flow of visitors, and the rock
strengthened where landslides and subsidence occur,
and the necessary restoration work put in hand
wherever this is possible.
The work needing to be done is, by its very extent,
a challenge to the international community which
cannot accept with resignation the catastrophe
threatening the Parthenon, the Erechtheum and its
caryatids, the Propylaea and the temple of Athena
Nike. For this reason, and in response to the
appeal made to it by the Greek Government, the
General Conference of Unesco, at its nineteenth
session recently held in Nairobi, by acclamation
declared itself in favour of a world-wide campaign,
to be conducted under the Organization's auspices,
to rally public and private support with a view to
safeguarding the Acropolis.
Unesco, whose Constitution lays upon it respon¬
sibility for the conservation and protection of the
world's inheritance of works of art and monuments
of history and science, is thus called upon to encou¬
rage the international community to make common
cause in order to save cultural treasures which,
although they belong to the heritage of Greece, are
also part of the shared inheritance of mankind. In
doing this, its intention is, by publicizing needs,
co-ordinating offers of help, soliciting external contri¬
butions and seeing that they are made available as
and when most effective, in agreement with the
Greek authorities, according to needs and possibi¬
lities, to support the work of the many friends of
Greece throughout ^he world who are ready to pro¬
vide direct assistance and co-operation.
This is why I am launching here a solemn appeal
to the conscience of the world so that the Acropolis
may be saved, just as my -predecessors appealed for
the monuments of Nubia in Upper Egypt, for Venice,
for the temple of Borobudur in Indonesia, for the
archaeological site at Mohenjodaro in Pakistan, and i
for Carthage in Tunisia. I

, In the name of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, I invite govern¬
ments, the National Commissions for Unesco, public
and private institutions and the general public in the
Organization's 141 Member States to be generous
in providing the assistance, whether money, equip¬
ment or services, needed to carry out the great task
on which the Greek Government has embarked.
Though the resources with which it has done so are
considerable, they are insufficient to complete a
project which will necessarily last several years.
I invite the intergovernmental organizations of all
continents, and in particular those of Europe, as
well as all foundations whose activities contribute
to cultural progress, to join in the immense task
which the Greek Government is undertaking in co¬
operation with Unesco.
I invite the international specialist organizations
which participate with Unesco in safeguarding
mankind's cultural heritage, such as the Interna¬
tional Centre for the Study of the Preservation and
Restoration of Cultural Property, the International
Council of Monuments and Sites and the Interna¬
tional Council of Museums, to support the activities
undertaken as part of the world campaign and to
encourage further steps to the same end.
I invite museums, art galleries, libraries and
theatres, in which the resplendent genius of Athens
is reflected, to arrange exhibitions, performances and
displays devoted to safeguarding the Acropolis, the
proceeds being paid into the funds set up in Member
States or the International Fund established by
Unesco.
I invite artists, writers, critics, historians and
composers the well-springs of whose work are in
Ancient Greece, and all those whose task is to pro¬
vide information, such as newspapermen, coluprtnists,
press, radio and television journalists and film¬
makers, to assist us with their knowledge and their
talents in arousing the support of the general public
in all countries.
I also invite schoolchildren, students and teachers
in all schools and universities to organize collections,
especially in conjunction with the National Com¬
missions for Unesco in their countries. The pro¬
ceeds from these collections will go towards preser¬
ving the crowning glory of a civilization to which art,
science and philosophy, even in our modern world,
still owe an immense debt of gratitude.
Finally, I invite all those millions of people who
have already visited or who intend to visit Athens,
as well as those who perhaps will never have that
opportunity but who sense clearly, whatever the
cultural area to which they belong, that the treasures
of the Acropolis testify in the highest degree to the
creative genius of man, to make a contribution,
however modest, which will enable them to give
a little of themselves to the collective effort.
I do not doubt that mankind will once more rise
to the need and prove equal to the task of saving
its heritage, and that in this way, over and above
the diversity of ideologies and systems, further
progress will be made in realizing that spiritual unity
sought by the nations of our world, in their growing
awareness of interdependence and a common
destiny and their desire to establish a new order
founded on the brotherhood of their peoples.

lost metropolis

4,000 years ago
discovered
in Syria
by Paolo Matthiae
PAOLO MATTHIAE, Italian archaeologist, is director of the Insti¬
tute of Near Eastern studies and professor of Near Eastern
archaeology and art history at the university of Rome. Since 1964
he has directed the work of the Italian archaeological mission to
Syria whose excavations led to the discovery of the city of Ebla.
This research was carried out in collaboration with the Syrian Arab
Republic's department ofantiquities (Damascus). The author ofmany
studies on art and archaeology, he is currently working on a critical
revision of the history of art in the ancient Near East in the light
of his discoveries at Ebla.

This ceremonial limestone vessel with a double basin was recently unearthed
in a temple at Ebla, capital of a powerful kingdom in Syria 4,000 years ago.
A lustral bowl used in religious ceremonies, it held purifying water offered
to the faithful. The two friezes embellishing the bowl depict, at top,
bearded figures wearing fringed skirts and below them the heads of crouching lions.
Dating from 1900 B.C. the bowl is one of the oldest examples of Syrian
sculptural art. (See also page 12).
THE recent discovery in Syria,
not far from Aleppo, of the
4,000-year-old royal archives
of the kingdom of Ebla is an event
that could revolutionize historical
studies of the ancient Near East.
The remains of Ebla were brought to
light by the Italian Archaeological
Mission of the University of Rome.
It will require several decades to
evaluate the full significance of the
finds made in this Mesopotamian
metropolis of Antiquity. This is
because the texts inscribed on the
clay tablets unearthed by the Italian
archaeologists concern many sectors
of the social and cultural life of the
Near East during a period of great
splendour (2300-2000 B.C.) about
which only tenuous and fragmentary
evidence has so far been available.
The value of the Ebla discovery
extends far beyond the horizons of
northern Syria and opens a window
on the world of the Near East as a
whole in ancient times.
Urban civilization began to develop
during the later centuries of the
fourth millennium B.C. in southern
Mesopotamia where the number of
cities progressively increased. Uruk,
on the left bank of the Euphrates, was
one remarkable example.
But the way in which this urban
civilization spread through the Near
East during the 3rd millennium B.C.
is still shrouded in mystery, and parti
cularly so' in the region of Syria.
The evidence for the sequence of
cultures comes from secondary
sources such as archaeological
remains unearthed around Antakya
in Turkey or at Hamma in northern
Syria.
Written records, in Mesopotamian,
Sumerian and Akkadian texts are
limited to the mention of a few cities
conquered by the great kings of the
dynasty of Akkad (2340-2220 B.C.),
or tributaries of the kings of the third
dynasty of Ur (circa 2120-2000 B.C.).
In the absence of any detailed
archaeological or written evidence,
historians have believed that the i
great Mesopotamian urban culture f !

(of the third millennium B.C., located
in the region of the lower Euphrates
and the Tigris, had provided a model
from which all the forms of urban cul¬
ture in the Near East were derived.
Research by the Italian Archaeolo¬
gical Mission of Rome University,
begun in Syria in 1964, aimed to
throw some light on the origins and
the development of Syrian urban cul¬
ture in relation to the Mesopotamian
world.
The Italian Mission, under my
direction, therefore planned a syste¬
matic archaeological excavation of
Tell Mardikh, a large man-made
mound lying about 60 kilometres
south of Aleppo in Northern Syria.
The mound was thought to cover the
vestiges of an important urban centre.
Permission to excavate was granted
by the Syrian Arab Republic's Depart¬
ment of Antiquities, which gave the
Italian mission constant support and
close collaboration.
Excavations carried out between
1964 and 1972 on the uppermost
part of the mound and at its centre
revealed the existence of a major city.
This metropolis is believed to have
flourished between 2000 and 1700
to 1600 B.C., during the period of
the Amorite dynasty in Mesopotamia,
to which the great king Hammurabi
of Babylon belonged.
Extending over 56 hectares and
dominated by the acropolis built at
the summit of the site, the city was
protected by strong ramparts raised
on earth platforms 60 metres thick.
Along the line of the ramparts were
four monumental gates each defen¬
ded by jutting fortifications and
flanked by wide bastions topped by
towers. Each gateway had two or
three adjoining entrances spanned
by an arch and supported by piers
covered with plaques of limestone
and of basalt.
From these gateways radiated the
streets which divided the lower city
into quarters where the private
dwellings were built. Around the
acropolis (whose slopes must have
been terraced) stood the administra¬
tive and religious buildings.
Each temple was dedicated to a
different divinity and in most cases
consisted of a single central hall
whose massive towering walls domi¬
nated the city's single storey dwel¬
lings made of sun-dried brick.
On the acropolis stood the royal
palace. It was unearthed in a badly
damaged state, owing to repeated
sackings over the centuries and to the
fact that its stones, perfectly squared
and smoothed, had been used for the
construction of later buildings.
Near to the palace stood the
Great Temple which, unlike the
smaller temples, had a series of
rooms: a long chamber ending in a
deep niche for the worship of the
god, a small ante-chamber and an
open frontal vestibule at the opposite
end, approached by a short staircase.
A decisive discovery made during
the 1968 excavations finally revealed
the name of the city as Ebla. A
statue found in one of the temples
bore an Akkadian cuneiform inscrip¬
tion on its torso with the name of
a prince, Ibbit-Lim, son of a king,
Igrish-Khep, who proclaimed him¬
self lord of Ebla. The statue dated
from about 2000 B.C.
Ebla had been mentioned in
earlier Sumerian and Akkadian
inscriptions of the 3rd millennium
B.C. as a powerful city that submit¬
ted to the great Sargon of Akkad
around 2340-2300 B.C. and sub¬
sequently fell into the hands of this
monarch's grandson, Naram-Sin
of Akkad, between 2250 and 2225
B.C. Later the city regained its
independence and between 2120
and 2000 B.C. rose again to major
importance.
After 2000 B.C., few texts men¬
tioned Ebla, although according to
one text there was a king of Ebla
around 1700 B.C. After 1600 B.C.
the city had probably become a
heap of ruins. That is what it must
have seemed around 1500 B.C. to
the great Pharaoh Thutmoses III,
who recorded on a monument at
Karnak that Ebla was one of the
places through which the Egyptian
army passed on its victorious march
to the Euphrates.
After this Ebla became a forgotten
city. The Italian excavations re
vealed, however, that during the 9th
and 8th centuries B.C., a small
Aramaic fortification stood on the
acropolis of Ebla. One or two
centuries later, in the Achaemenid
period, there was a modest village
there.
Then even these traces of set¬
tlement disappeared from Tell
Mardikh. The mound was complete¬
ly abandoned and its surface became
ploughed land. Only for a short
whileperhaps just one seasonwas
the acropolis used as a military camp
site, possibly in the campaigns that
devastated the region during the
Crusades.
The picture of Ebla, as reconsti¬
tuted by the excavations of the Italian
Mission, makes a major contribution
to the history of ancient Syria. Ebla
is seen to have been a leading poli¬
tical centre of northern Syria between
2000 B.C. and 1850 to 1700 B.C.
After the later date the city must
have become a vassal of Aleppo,
one of the leading states at the time
of Hammurabi of Babylon.
The Italian archaeologists estimate
that at its most flourishing period
Ebla had between 20,000 and
30,000 inhabitants (an extremely
large population for that time).
Ebla remained a vassal of Aleppo
until about 1600 B.C., when it must
certainly have fallen to the Hittite
invaders who under Khattushili I and
Murshili I overcame' first Aleppo
and then Babylon.

Our discovery of Ebla as it was at
its zenith, and in particular the disco¬
very of artistic and architectural fea¬
tures of the period between 2000 B.C.
and 1700 B.C., give an entirely new
historical valuation to Syria, greater
than the one usually accepted in
historiography.
Syria, a land with an ethnically
diverse population, often subjected
to outside domination and varied
cultural influences, had hitherto
seemed to be a meeting ground for
other peoples rather than the centre
of an autonomous cultural develop¬
ment.
The systematic exploration of Ebla
as it existed ' from 2000 to 1 600
B.C. during the Amorite dynasties has
produced evidence to refute the
traditional interpretation. For the
period of the Amorite dynasties, or
more correctly the paleo-Syrian
period, saw the formation of a speci¬
fically Syrian culture, with an urban
organization, architecture and artistic
vision of striking originality.
Moreover, the most fruitful aspects
of this paleo-Syrian culture are to be
found in other centres of Northern
Syria even as late as the first millen¬
nium B.C. They testify very clearly
to the continuity of the tradition,
showing that the originality of Ebla
was no mere transitory process.
However, the very originality of the
paleo-Syrian culture shown at Tell-
Mardikh raised the problem of the
historical roots of this culture, and it
was on this question that the Italian
Archaeological Museum focussed its
research from 1973.
Its studies were concentrated on
the remains of Ebla dating from the
third millennium B.C. to find evidence
of the city destroyed by Sargon and
by Naram-Sin of Akkad. Ebla was
mentioned by Gudea, governor of
the Sumerian city of Lagash, as a
source of timber, and documents of
the great kings of the third dynasty of
Ur describe Ebla as a centre produ¬
cing highly prized textiles.
So in 1973 our mission began the
systematic exploration of the western
slope of Tell Mardikh, hoping to
discover traces of an important
settlement dating from the third
millennium B.C.
After three years of excavation, we
have brought to light part of the royal
palace whose period of greatest splen¬
dour must have been between 2400
and 2250 B.C. Archaeological and
epigraphic evidence indicate that this
was indeed the palace destroyed by
Naram-Sin of Akkad in 2225 B.C.
The section of the palace now
unearthed has proved to be a striking
monumental achievement of proto-
Syrian architecture. So far the only
part explored is the monumental
audience court surrounded by
porticoes with tall wooden columns.
On one side of the court lay a
raised podium where the king satk
during official audiences. On ano-r
Excavation of the remains of the city
of Ebla, at Tell Mardikh near Aleppo,
has revealed striking monumental
architecture of ancient Syria.
Opposite page, ruins of the "celia"
(the sanctuary enshrining the statue
of a god) in the great temple which
dominated the city in the 19th
and 18th centuries B. C. Sturdy
walls of sun-dried brick (left) are
vestiges of single-storey houses in a
residential quarter of the lower city.
They date from the period
(1700-1650 B. C.) when Ebla was a
wealthy settlement of some
30,000 inhabitants. Wooden figurine
above came to light in Ebla's royal
palace. The statuette (20 cm high),
which may depict a king of Ebla. is
in a remarkable state of preservation
although carved some 4,300 years ago.

An archaeological
triumph: the discovery
of an unknown language
In 1968 Italian archaeologists made a decisive discovery which proved
that the mound of Tell Mardikh hid the vanished city of Ebla,
a major commercial centre of Antiquity whose location was completely
unknown. They unearthed the broken torso of a 2000 B.C. basalt statue
(above) which bore among its cuneiform inscriptions in the Akkadian
language the word "Ebla". A few years later came one of the most amazing
archaeological finds of modern times, the discovery of thousands of baked
clay tablets (right) on which the royal archives of Ebla were inscribed.
Many of the tablets, dating from 2350 to 2250 B.C. had survived intact (below).
They were scratched with notches in cuneiform writing in a hitherto unknown
language, since renamed Eblaite. Scholars are now deciphering the Eblaite
inscriptions, since in addition to accounts, inventories and price-lists the texts
contain some equivalent expressions in Eblaite and Sumerjan, a Near Eastern
language of Antiquity.

, ther was a great doorway giving
access to the palace. Of the palace
itself only two rooms have so far
been excavated, plus a great ceremo¬
nial staircase with four ramps. The
steps were decorated with jewelled
incrustations now lost. Apart from
this a few smaller spaces have been
cleared, including some used as small
storerooms.
With walls sometimes reaching
2.80 metres thick, the structure has
a very impressive appearance. This
and the refinement of certain
building details express an original
architectural concept, some of
whose characteristics were handed
down and later influenced the Ara¬
maic palaces of northern Syria of the
first millennium B.C.
But the most astounding find at
Ebla is undoubtedly that of the palace
archives, inscribed with cuneiform
writings on clay tablets. The tablets
were arranged in two small closed
rooms, in corners of the court of
audience. The smaller room contain¬
ed a collection of about 1,000 clay
tablets or fragments of tablets. In
the bigger room we discovered about
1 5,000 tablets or fragments of
tablets.
These two sets of archives escaped
destruction by Naram-Sin's soldiers
because they were not considered of
any value. The smaller collection
(about 1,000 tablets) was strewn in
heaps between the ruins- of the col¬
lapsed ceiling and of the masonry.
In the larger collection, the thou¬
sands of tablets must have been
stored on wooden shelves running
along the walls and held by vertical
wooden poles fixed to the floor. The
tablets were found piled up still more
or .less in order on the floor where
they had fallen when the shelving
burned.
The cuneiform tablets are written
in Sumerian and in the Eblaite
tongue, a Semitic language that
shows strong resemblancesthough
it is older by more than a thousand
yearsto the Semitic languages of
the "Canaanite" group of the first
millennium B.C., and especially to
Phoenician.
Professor Giovanni Pettinato, the
epigraphist of the Italian Mission
and professor of Assyriology of the

, discovered in one of the rooms of the
palace in 1974 before the great col¬
lection of archives was brought to
light.
An examination of the huge mass
of texts discovered in the palace in
September and October 1975 has
fully confirmed his interpretation.
The Eblaite texts of the royal archives
of Ebla thus represent extraordinarily
rich documentation that will advance
the deciphering of the texts and the
reconstruction of this language,
along with the study of Semitic
languages in general.
The majority of the Eblan texts are
bookkeeping statements concerning
an international trade in textiles and
metals. Ebla was famous for both
these items of merchandise in the
Mesopotamian world of that time.
The palace itself kept the files on
what we would call registers of con¬
signments.
An interesting detail is that the
texts mention, among the various
qualities of cloth, some which were
"lined with gold". These must have
been high quality textiles which even
today are known as "damask" (from
the Syrian city of Damascus where
they were first produced.).
The tablets provide detailed infor¬
mation on trade in the Near East in
the third millennium B.C. and also
much data on the historical geography
of that period. They name many
cities to which goods were sent.
They show that this trade had very
wide horizons, because it extended
from the Mediterranean coast to the
east of Mesopotamia, and from Ana¬
tolia to Palestine.
The archives also contain many
texts made up of lists of Sumerian
words and phrases, and of bilingual
vocabularies with indications of the
Sumerian pronunciation.
In addition to giving linguistic
information of the greatest impor¬
tance, the tablets also provide valuable
information on the organization of
education at that time. They show
that all instruction was strictly con¬
trolled by the state, (as in Mesopo¬
tamia during the same period) and
was designed to train students to
become state administrators. The
archives contain school exercises
written by students whose names
appear in later official documents as
leading civil servants.
The archives also contain adminis¬
trative, legal and diplomatic docu¬
ments. Some deal with budgetary
aspects of the administration and
throw light on the internal organiza¬
tion of the state, at the "ministerial
level", on the organization and govern¬
ment of the provinces and on the
financial structures of the state, inclu¬
ding the collection of taxes.
There are also facts on the popula¬
tion of Ebla, on administrative and
juridical problems, such as questions
of inheritance or the dividing up of
booty. Diplomatic documents in¬
clude three international treaties, one
of them being a pact between Ebla
and Assur, of particular interest
because of the complexity of its
clauses and the political relation¬
ships it reveals.
A certain number of literary texts
are of exceptional value. One seems
to be an Eblaite version of a passage
from the Mesopotamian saga of
Gilgamesh, the great Assyrian hero
who according to legend was king
of Uruk.
Other literary texts include myths,
hymns and exorcist spells and are
most probably translations into the
Eblaite tongue of Sumerian works
whose originals have previously
reached us only in relatively late
Mesopotamian versions, written
down about 1800 B.C. when Sume¬
rian was no longer a spoken language.
From this rich harvest, one more
example can well illustrate the revolu¬
tionary character of the discoveries.
The texts tell us about a complete
dynasty of at least five kings of Ebla
who appear to be contemporaries of
the kings of Akkad, from Sargon to
Naram-Sin.
This Eblan dynasty, of which writ¬
ten tradition had lost the record,
appears to have dominated the Near
East from Northern Mesopotamia to
the Mediterranean, and to have been
inspired by a universalist ideology.
It is now almost certain that in
order to express the Eblaite language
in writing, the royal chancery of Ebla
successfully undertook the complex
adaptation of the cuneiform syllabic
script (invented in Mesopotamia to
write Sumerian).
With the findings at Ebla, Syria
has rediscovered one of the most bril¬
liant pages of its long history, and
thus takes its place alongside Meso¬
potamia and Egypt in the early pro¬
gress of mankind towards civilization.

Slaughter
of the innocents
The church of Rema Medhani
Alem, on the now-uninhabited
island of Rema, is traditionally
thought to have been founded
by a monk, the brother of a king
of Ethiopia. On the walls of the
"maqdas", the square sanctuary
characteristic of Lake Tana's
churches, an unbroken expanse
of paintings narrate the life of
the Virgin Mary, as well as
depicting saints, martyrs and a
dream which revealed to Herod,
slaughterer of the innocents,
his own true nature (left).
The dream (enlarged detail at
right) is a symbolic representation
of Herod as a serpent, symbol of
evil, crushing a mass of human
beings in its coils. The pictures
are executed in the traditional
colours of Ethiopian painting:
yellow, red, green and black.

^ After the Second World War the
art and monuments of this immense
country, situated like a wedge on the
eastern flank of Africa, increasingly
aroused the curiosity of a growing
number of visitors. However, much
of its age-old heritage of architec¬
ture and paintings had seriously deter¬
iorated and the task of preserving it
was all the more difficult since these
cultural treasures were scattered
over a vast area. About ten years
ago the Ethiopian government asked
Unesco for help in saving these pre¬
cious works of art.
In 1968 the Ethiopian government
and Unesco began to work out a pro¬
gramme of preservation and restora¬
tion of sites and monuments along
the "Historic Route". This runs
through Axum (capital of ancient
Abyssinia at the beginning of the
Christian era) to the holy city of
Lalibella with its 13th-century mono¬
lithic churches hewn from the natural
rock, and the city of Gondar, founded
in the 17th century when it became
Ethiopia's capital, finally reaching the
falls of the Blue Nile and Lake Tana.
The "Historic Route" thus in
itself offers a voyage of cultural dis¬
covery through Ethiopia, a country
which was a great African empire
before the Christian era and where
in the 4th century Christianity brought
an element of unity to peoples of dif¬
ferent ethnic origin and cultures. Over
the centuries Ethiopia was exposed
to a wide range of influences, through
its contacts with southern Arabia,
Byzantium and Coptic Egypt, mo¬
nastic Syria, Armenia and Jerusalem,
medieval and Renaissance Europe
and eastern Asia, particularly India.
And yet a totally original art flower¬
ed in Ethiopia, finding expression
in both painting and architecture, the
most outstanding examples of which
are the churches and monasteries of
Lake Tana.
Lake Tana, Ethiopia's biggest lake,
through which flow the waters of the
Upper Blue Nile, is located in the
west of the rugged Ethiopian
highlands, over 1,800 m. above sea
level. The heart-shaped lake (some
80 km long and almost as wide) is
dotted with 38 islands some of
which were for centuries important
centres of art and culture.
The churches of Lake Tana are
circular in form, with a square sanc¬
tuary in the centre. They have doors
corresponding to the cardinal points
of the compass and conical roofs
covered with thatch. Their walls
are covered with paintings stretching
over dozens of square metres. In
the 18th-century monastery of Narga
Selassie paintings embellish an area
of no less than 350 square metres.
The ornamental paintings of Lake
Tana, none of them older than the
1 7th century, have a style, in terms
of composition and colours, that is
quite unique. Their subjects are the
traditional images of Christian icono
graphy, depicting Christ, the Virgin
Mary, the saints, the apostles, the
archangels and the serpent in the
Garden of Eden. Their vivid hues,
geometric forms and haloed faces
with wide staring eyes have an
obvious affinity with the 14th- and
15th-century illuminated manuscripts
in the same Lake Tana monasteries,
to which Unesco devoted an out¬
standing album of colour reproduc¬
tions in 1961 (1).
No less than 3,000 figures from the
scriptures are depicted in one church
on the island of Zeghie. But many
churches of this period contain, in

by the New York Graphic Society by arrangement

Leroy; texts by Stephen Wright and Otto
A. Jäger.
addition to such vast compositions,
smaller pictures in some cases no
bigger than playing cards, but exe¬
cuted with the same wealth of artistic
virtuosity.
Many of these art treasures are
today in urgent need of restoration.
Water seeps through dilapidated
thatch roofs. The paintings are
fading and in some cases virtually
hanging in rags. In some churches
pigeons are destroying paintings by
pecking to pieces the mud and dung
plaster on which they are mounted.
A systematic inventory of Ethiopian
works of art has still to be completed.
Theft and vandalism are rife in aban¬
doned churches and monasteries
where for two centuries monks
created the outstanding composi¬
tions which make the islands of Lake

Intricate geometric and floral designs on the plaster foot and hand
seen here are typical examples of the art of mehndi (henna) painting,
a form of body decoration that holds an important place in Indian art
and culture. Powder from ground henna leaves is made into a
coloured paste which women, particularly those of the Vaishya community
in Rajasthan, use to paint symbolic designs on their hands and feet.

A FOR HAPPINESS
idi" art of symbols for all seasons
IN India, religious beliefs often
inspire traditional folk arts. In
Rajasthan State, southwest of
Delhi where the famed Rajput forts
and palaces dot the fertile plains, the
art of Mehndi or hand painting for
women is integrated with the region's
festivals and ceremonial occasions.
For centuries, women in India and
the Middle East have used mehndi or
henna for decoration, but the women
of the Vaishya community in Rajasthan
are noted for using it to cover their
palms, fingers and feet with artistic
designs. These decorations vary
according to the occasion, whether
it is a marriage, childbirth, or festi¬
vals such as Holi and Gangour.
Mehndi or henna is widely culti¬
vated in Africa and southwest Asia
as an ornamental and dye plant. Its
uses include dyeing hair and some¬
times animals and hides. It is also
used as an astringent against skin
diseases, burns and bruises.
From Biblical times, Egyptian and
Indian women dyed their fingernails
and parts of their hands and feet an
orange red colour with henna paste
in order to enhance their beauty.
The colour would last three or four
weeks.
Mehndi art holds an important
place in Indian art and culture and
is described among the So/ah Sringar
(sixteen adornments of a woman).
Maharisi Vatsyayan also included
mehndi as one of his 64 arts for
women, which include painting the
teeth, dyeing cloth and staining the
body with sandal wood, saffron and
myrtle.
It was believed that mehndi pain¬
ting came to India with the Muslims,
but it actually began long before the
Gupta period (350 A. D.). The
ancient Ajanta-Ellora cave murals
depict scenes relating to mehndi
decoration. In one mural, a princess
of Pataliputra reclines half-asleep
under a tree while her girlfriends
busily paint her hands and feet with
mehndi designs.
But the use of mehndi became
common at the beginning of the
Mogul period during Muslim raids on
villages to kidnap young virgins. The
raiders would also often take young
married women. In order to distin¬
guish themselves from unmarried
women, married women used mehndi
because it faded much more slowly
than the tumeric or saffron with which
they were usually anointed.
Today this body adornment has
evolved into intricate geometric and
floral designs, which still flourish as
an essential decoration that has be¬
come lost and forgotten in other
countries.
Mehndi in the form of henna leaves
is ground into a powder and mixed
with lemon juice, candy water and
a few drops of kerosene to produce a
paste of deep, long lasting colour.
Hands and feet are washed well with
besan (gram flour) or soap.
A matchstick or thin wire or even
just an index finger is used to apply
the beautiful patterns. The paste is
put on in the form of a thin thread
without allowing the applicator to
touch the skin. When the design is
completed, it is left to dry and stain
the palm.
Etching lime paste on the red
mehndi produces the "batik" method,
or white designs on red background.
To maintain the deep red colour,
sesame or mustard oil is rubbed on
the hands and then washed off with
water. The designs can last two or
three weeks. Although ready-made
designs also exist and can be applied
quickly, they fade much more
rapidly. Both time and devotion are
required for the task involved in
applying these designs (four to eight
hours in the case of brides).
Mehndi is a symbol of good luck
in married life. It is believed that the
deeper the red colour of mehndi on a
woman's palms, the more herhusband
loves her. As a symbol of lasting
love between husband and wife, only
married women are permitted to
practice the art of mehndi and women
consider it a sign of wifehood.
Unmarried women and widows are
not allowed to wear mehndi designs,
although dead women are decorated
like brides with mehndi. Unmarried
girls and boys are not allowed to stain
their feet with mehndi as it is a bad
omen. A pregnant woman cannot
use mehndi.
It is believed that Lakshmi, the
goddess of luck and happiness, dwells
in mehndi designs. If a dot of
mehndi stains the forehead of a man
or woman, it is considered to be a
sign of luck. Mehndi is also a
symbol of good luck offered to gods
and goddesses to appease them and
request favours and to ward off evil
spirits. Thus religious, luck-seeking
women all over India love to wear
mehndi.

MEHNDI'S MANY MEANINGS. Mehndi designs like the one
being applied with artistic skill (above) are used to mark numerous occasions
and events, including the seasons, festivals and ceremonies, and they are
especially linked with marriage and happiness in married life. Motifs in the
mehndi paintings on these pages include flowers (for happiness), scorpions
(symbol of love), and sweetmeats (long married life). The art of mehndi has
also evolved with the times. In "old mehndi" style (right) designs are drawn
within a square or rectangle covering the whole of the palm. "New mehndi"
design (above right) is done within a circle leaving enough space around
the central motif to highlight its beauty.

are essential decorations for a mar¬
riage ceremony. Another Hindu
custom named hathleva where the
bride and groom in front of the
sacred fire, hold each other's hand
in which a ball of mehndi has been
placed, also symbolizes their union.
Their palms both become stained and
it is believed that the deeper the
tint of mehndi, the happier their
married life will be.
Arranged marriages where the
bride and groom first meet at the
marriage ceremony are still common
in India. The philosophy that love
germinates with the consummation
of marriage and grows with time is
expressed in a folk song in which
mehndi plays an integral part:
Bana (the groom), you are rich in
colour like mehndi,
I keep you in my closed fist.
Bana, you are beautiful like colly-
rium,
I keep you hidden in my
eyelids.
Bana, you are beautiful like the sun,
I keep you in my flower vase.
Bana, you are lustrous like a pearl,
I keep you threaded in my
nose-ring.
Bana, you are rich in colour like
mehndi,
I wear you lovingly in my
beautiful palm.
In another sentimental Rajasthani
folk song, a man remarks on the
beautiful mehndi coloured palms of
his beloved:
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
Put thy hand on my heart;
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
I make an offering of rubies
and jewels;
The love juice of mehndi is
a lovely tint.
Mehndi designs can be classified
according to the following divisions:
seasons, festivals, ceremonies and
miscellaneous. Miscellaneous de¬
signs supplement the specific and
rather limited designs for festivals
and ceremonies. Many local folk
customs and beliefs are represented
in these designs.
Blcchu, the scorpion, is a symbol of
love and a popular design, especially
in the summer. The parrot is also an
important symbol in Rajasthani folk
songs as the heroine's messenger.
The peacock, noted for its beauty and
multicoloured appearance, is the be¬
loved companion of wives who have
been separated from their husbands.
Other daily objects depicted are
sweetmeats, clothes, flowers and
objects used in games, such as cha-
karis (a whirling toy like a pulley).
Keri (unripe mango) and water
chestnuts are also often drawn, as
well as lotuses. Designs with the
sun, moon, stars and keri repre¬
sent perfect, continuous married life.
Flowers symbolize happiness, unripe
mangoes signify virginity and the
coming of summer, and the peacock,
parrot and scorpion symbolize love.
Indian seasons are summer, rains
and winter. The summer and rainy
seasons last from the Holi to the
Deepava/i festivals, or from March
to October. Mehndi is suitable for
the summer because it produces a
cool, soothing effect on the hands
and has medicinal properties which
are also appreciated during the rainy
season. Hundreds of varieties of
bijanis (fans) are a popular and appro¬
priate motif for summer as they
symbolize air and relief from heat.
During the rainy season, the designs
are more abundant, elaborate and
exuberant than during the summer
and even more so than in the winter.
Mehndi designs reach their height of
beauty and magnificence during this
time. They include keri and cho-
par, which is a game resembling
backgammon. Lañaría, which is an
ocean wave or river's ripple, repre¬
sents surging human emotions of joy
and excitement and reflects the pre¬
vailing mood of the season. It is
also the season of mela or fairs, festi¬
vals and swings when women spend
their time holidaying and swinging in
the qarden. The emotions expressed
in brilliant garments with both rain¬
bow colours and laharia and keri^ mo¬
tifs have been transferred to mehndi
designs. Ghevar, a variety of sweet¬
meat presented to sisters by brothers
during a festival, provides the inspi¬
ration for another common mehndi
design.
Winter is the least auspicious
season for mehndi due to its cooling
effect and therefore there are fewer
designs.
SPECIFIC designs are used for
certain festivals such as Kajjali
Tija. Holi ana Gangour. Many
ceremonies and festivals are meant
for the well-being of male members
of a household. But the Tija festival
honours married women who decor¬
ate their palms with house designs
to wish for increased material wealth
for their husbands.
Holi, one of the most colourful
festivals in India, honours the impor¬
tant historic period of Vedic religious
feuds. During this time, women
draw two of the oldest musical instru¬
ments on their palms. These are
used only for songs relating to this
festival.
Gangour, a marriage festival, is
one of the most significant for mehndi.
On the last day, unmarried girls
hoping to find a suitable husband put
32 marks of mehndi on the wall.
-Married women hope for an eternal
married life by drawing designs of
various sweetmeats.
Mehndi designs are only loosely
classified according to various cere¬
monial occasions such as first pre
gnancy and suraj (childbirth). How¬
ever, in marriage ceremonies, kalasha
(pitcher) and the swastika are signi¬
ficant symbols on the bride's hands.
The pitcher is significant in all reli¬
gious ceremonies while the swastika
symbolizes the well-being of the
future. The bride's hands are also
decorated with mehndi on the occa¬
sion of her leaving her mother's house
for that of her mother-in-law and vice
versa.
EHNDI designs are never
static but change with
time. Just as new ideas
keep folk songs and tales up to date,
so are new lines added to the mehndi
art.
In "old mehndi," the designs are
drawn within a square or rectangle
and the whole palm is covered from
the wrist to the fingertips so that
there are few bare surfaces. In
"new mehndi," the designs are done
within concentric circles and cover
only the centre of the palm, with
empty spaces scantily covered with
small motifs.
"Old mehndi" tends to crowd the
least available space with heavy
motifs, but "new mehndi" leaves
enough space around the central
motif to highlight its beauty, a trend
which follows modern painting. Now
the trend is for floral designs.
Mehndi customs also prevail in the
states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal,
Orissa, Gujarat, Kashmir and Haryana
which borders Rajasthan. . These
states have their own folk songs
which express mehndi's importance
in daily life. Mehndi also became
part of Muslim tradition when thou¬
sands of Hindus converted to Islam
during the Mogul period and took
their customs, including mehndi,
with them. Muslims call it Muhar-
ram but the variety of their designs
is not as great as those of Hindu
women.
Mehndi has been deeply woven
into the fabric of folk life and has
infiltrated proverbs. The "mehndi
stained hand" proverb refers to those
who shirk their work. It is also said
that "mehndi only gives colour when
it is ground on stone with a pestle,"
meaning that only when a person
undergoes hardship can he or she
gain some experience from life.
Mehndi presents a true picture of
folk life and a window on the folk way
of thinking. Two meaningful lines by
an Urdu poet express the beauty,
romance and richness of the mehndi
tradition:
"Now I have decided to write my
heart's desire on mehndi leaves. So
when she comes to pluck mehndi
leaves, she may lay her hand upon
them and read my secret message."

Adults learn to read in an open-air literacy class near Dar es Salaam (Tanzania).

AFTER LITERACY, WHAT NEXT?
Tanzania records its heritage of folk tales
in reading books for the newly literate
by Simoni Malya
ILLITERACY is a form of oppres¬
sion to the extent that it has nar¬
rowed the scope of so many of
our adults and has inhibited them from
participating fully in solving problems
and making decisions that affect
their day-to-day existence.
The oppressive nature of illiteracy
in the United Republic of Tanzania
and the seriousness of its impact on
our people can be seen quite vividly.
It is estimated that there are over
13 million Tanzanians of whom
SIMONI MALYA, Tanzanian educator, is
senior resident tutor at the Institute ofAdult
Education, Dar es Salaam. He is the author
of several books in Kiswahili on the develop¬
ment of reading materials for the newly
literate and the creation of conditions enabling
them to retain their knowledge. A longer ver¬
sion of this article originally appeared in
Unesco's international educational quarterly
Prospects (Vol. VI. N°. 1, 1976).
7 million are adults and 6 million are
under 1 5 years of age. Over 80 per
cent of the adults cannot read or write.
This data has been drawn from a
census conducted in 1967 in the
United Republic of Tanzania (main¬
land). As a result of a literacy cam¬
paign embarked on after the census,
the rate of illiteracy has definitely
dropped but exact figures are not yet
available.
These are the people who form the
productive sector of our population.
In order for them to participate in
development and change they must,
in the first place, be conscious of the
need to develop and change. We
are not saying that people cannot
bring about development and change
merely because they are unable to
read and write. We are saying,
rather, that literacy is a useful tool
and that it may quicken the pace of
both these processes.
It is further estimated that out of
Tanzania's 6 million young people
about 3 million are of school age.,
Yet half of these do not go to
school at all, either because no
schools are available near their homes
or because of a general apathy to¬
wards schooling. This means that
in addition to the illiterate adult popu¬
lation there are some 1.5 million
youngsters in danger of growing
up without learning to read and write.
It is estimated, moreover, that well
over 90 per cent of Tanzanians live in
rural areas where the rate of illite¬
racy compared to that of the urban
areas is overwhelming. The efforts
of the adult educator to create a
favourable environment for literacy
therefore must be focused largely on w
the rural areas. r

Tanzania has launched a far-reaching

areas where 90 per cent of the
country's population lives today.
Right, market day in Lushoto, a rural
community some 300 km north-west
of Dar es Salaam. Opposite
page, village woman of the Uluguru
mountains, 200 km west of the capital.
Furthermore, the lack of follow-up
reading materials means that each
year over 60 pec cent of those adults
who once knew how to read and write
relapse into illiteracy. This poses
another grim challenge to the adult
educator, and calls for a two-pronged
attack in the war against illiteracy.
As adults are being made literate,
sound steps must be taken simulta¬
neously to prepare reading materials
which will motivate the newly literate
to keep on reading and retain their
knowledge. There is no single or
simple answer to this problem
because the number of adults to be
attended to is so vast and their tastes
for reading materials are inevitably
varied.
Finally, while the estimated rate
of illiteracy among men is over 80
per cent, among women it is over 90
per cent. There is an urgent need
for something specific that will appeal
to parents and especially to mothers
and housewives so that they may be
induced to continue reading after they
have become literate. It would be
unthinkable to set about promoting
development and change without
taking account of women, who have
such a significant role to play.
From these few facts and figures
we can fairly describe our country as a
nation of illiterates. And so the
problem is how to teach reading
and writing meaningfully and, at the
same time, prepare the required
follow-up reading materials.
In attempting to find at least a par¬
tial solution to this problem we
turned to materials which originated
from adults themselves, influenced
by ideas and reactions against the
"banking" concept of education in
which, in the words of the Brazilian
educator and sociologist, Paulo
Freiré, "the scope of action allowed
to students extends only as far as
receiving, filing and storing the
deposits."
We imagined that such raw mat¬
erials as traditional stories could
provide a base upon which follow-up
reading materials could be produced
through the participation and invol¬
vement of adults. Such materials
are likely to appeal to them more
than those produced outside the
country. So we chose Tanzanian tra¬
ditional stories and selected a tenta
tive system consisting of seven easy
and distinct steps.
First, we located tribal elders who
had earned a reputation as story¬
tellers and who were willing to share
those stories with somebody from
outside, their tribal grouping.
Then we visited and made friends
with them individually. In the com¬
munities we visited, story-tellers were
accorded the respect that is due to
teachers. We introduced ourselves
as young teachers who were keen
to learn from older teachers and we
were made to feel most welcome.
Thirdly, we exchanged views on the
significance of traditional stories and
the importance of having them
recorded permanently. A date was
set during which story-tellers from
around the village would be invited to
contribute and participate in a semi¬
nar-workshop on the production of
reading materials.
When they came we were faced
with the problem of creating an
atmosphere that was conducive to
story-telling. The elders themselves
dictated these conditions.
They decided when they would
work, when they would go for a
walk, when they would eat, in short
the general conduct of the seminar-
workshop that would produce reading
materials from their stories. The
chairman, whom they themselves
elected, spoke both their own lan¬
guage and Kiswahili fluently.
In the fifth phase, before taping the
stories, we again discussed the im¬
portance of having stories and other
traditional materials recorded. Em¬
phasis was put on the fact that we
do not have sufficient reading mat¬
erials and that elders were in a position
to provide us with such materials.
It was also stressed that the materials
contained values which would soon
disappear if we did not write them
down while the teachers were alive.
Then there was a rehearsal before
the actual taping. This was meant
to enable the elders to recall the
stories and be as fluent as possible.
In the seventh and final phase the
stories were recorded. When one
elder completed a story, it was played
back immediately, first, to give an
opportunity for correction, and also to
amuse all participants, who enjoyed
hearing their own voices from the
tape recorder.
But before the tapes were stored,
the stories had to be translated into
KiswahiliTanzania's national lan¬
guage then printed. Here
the chairman of the seminar-work¬
shop also had a crucial role. Every,
sentence was examined until the
chairman was satisfied that its equi¬
valent in Kiswahili had been found.
It was only after checking against
the original statements from the tape
recorder that sentences were trans¬
cribed into Kiswahili. The process
of checking and counter-checking
went on until a whole story had its

equivalent in Kiswahili.
Next, manuscripts were turned into
the first (rough) typed draft of a book¬
let. This consisted of typing the
manuscripts into the shape, size and
pages that the completed booklet
would have.
Then, the first typescript was sten¬
cilled, and the stencils were number¬
ed and duplicated according to the
number of booklets required. In this
way the adults' own reading materials
were born ! Could this be an ins¬
tance in which the participants had
"said their own words and named
the world" as Paulo Freiré has put it,
thereby making a tiny but significant
move away from the "culture of
silence ?"
The problems we ran into in collect¬
ing and printing these materials in¬
cluded travelling long distances some¬
times in order to get to know only
bne elder in an entire village who was
reputed as a story-teller and who was
willing to recount one or more stories
he had remembered for so long.
On several occasions it was not
easy to convince elders to leave their
homes in order to be involved in a
seminar or workshop.
Despite the excellent work done by
the chairmen of these seminar-work¬
shops and the fact that they could
speak fluently both the languages of
their fellow-participants and Kis¬
wahili, it was not always easy to find
exact translations of the original
texts. We were more concerned
with the general meanings of sen¬
tences and phrases than with indivi¬
dual words.
The . elders agreed to give away
their "copyright" on these stories for
the sake of producing relevant and
readable materials and of recording in
print a part of our culture which is in
danger of vanishing as tribal elders
pass on. This is a problem that calls
for urgent action.
The problems we encountered are
nothing at all compared to the satis¬
faction we derived from seeing,
holding and reading booklets that had
been produced by our adults.
Transforming the texts into books
is a minor problem, compared to the
major ones of gathering the materials
and recording them permanently in
typescript, manuscript or even tapes.
Nevertheless, in stencilled form,
the stories may not be attractive to
adults who are used to reading pri¬
mers with larger print. Then, of
course, there is the question of illus¬
trations; our adults prefer books with
pictures to those without them.
Nevertheless, the question of pub¬
lishing books out of the typescripts
should be considered secondary to
the problem of securing the raw mate¬
rials. We have already prepared
five booklets with a total ' of 28
stories and 59 proverbs. Already we
have distributed over 500 copies
within the Mwanza region of Tanzania
alone and we have standing orders
for over 1,500 copies of the type¬
scripts. So even in typescript form
the materials can be very popular.
If we send the typescripts to pri¬
vate publishing firms we run the risk
of defeating our purpose. Whereas
we are interested in preparing the
materials as abundantly and as
cheaply as possible, private publishers
are interested in maximizing profit.
And so, when sufficient typescripts
have been secured, we suggest they
be handled by non-profit-making
national institutions.
The stories produced so far are
brief and appeal to people who are
not used to reading long texts. They
have been written in Kiswahili, a
language most adult Tanzanians un¬
derstand even if they cannot speak
it fluently. Through this language
a reader interested in finding out
something about the culture of
Wanyamwezi or Wasukuma can do
so by reading these stories even
though he cannot speak Kinyamwezi
or Kisukuma. The stories have hu¬
mour which can be appreciated by all
those who are familiar with the cul¬
ture of Tanzania.
Thus far we have discussed the
production of these reading materials
as a solution to the problem: "After
literacy, what next?" But gathering
and printing traditional stories is more
than a mere exercise in procuring
reading materials.
Such materials incorporate the type
of education that our forefathers
practised. They embody learning
and teaching situations which may
help us to find better ways of serving

How
the Hippo
lost
his hair
Drawing C M. P Papapietro, from
Contes du Zaire (Tales of Zaire) published
by the Conseil International de la
Langue Française. Pans 1976.
LONG ago the Hippo used to live on land and not in rivers and lakes
like he does today. He used to be a beautiful animal with long,
» soft hair.
Other animals wished they could have hair as beautiful as the Hippo's.
One animal that particularly envied the Hippo was the Giraffe. The
Giraffe played a trick which made the Hippo lose all his beautiful hair and
become perhaps the most ugly-looking animal known.
This is what happened. The weather became bitterly cold. Every
animal was shivering. The Hippo was shivering like the other animals
but because he was so huge he appeared to be shivering more than any
of them.
The Giraffe was shivering too but when he saw the Hippo he pretended
that he was not feeling the cold. He cunningly approached the Hippo
and said, "I can see you are shivering badly. What's the matter? Why
has this change in the weather affected you more adversely than anyone
else?"
"I really don't know why I should shiver so much," replied the Hippo
innocently. "In the last few days I thought I was going to die."
The Giraffe pretended to be thinking hard about how to help the
Hippo. He meditated for a while and then said, "Well, you've got long
hair which should be able to protect you from either excessive heat or
excessive cold. But your hair doesn't seem to be of much use in this
kind of weather. Was this so in the past or is this an unusual occu¬
rence?" The Giraffe spoke like a sympathiser who is willing to help but
has to diagnose the situation before prescribing a cure.
"I must say that I have gone through all sorts of weather but this cold
spell perplexes me completely," answered the Hippo in a self-pitying tone.
Not far from where the Hippo and the Giraffe were talking there was a
crater. In this crater there was a spring that produced boiling water.
So hot was the water that nobody used it except for medicinal purposes.
Certainly it did not do for bathing.
The Giraffe was aware that if one bathed in the pool in which this
water collected, one would be burnt to death. "I have an idea", said
the Giraffe after a pause. "Yours is a rather extraordinary case and I
suppose it calls for an extraordinary treatment. There is a pond in the
crater which has warm water." (The Giraffe knew that the water was
more than just warm. It was as hot as hot could be.) "Why don't you
go and dip yourself in that pool?" suggested the Giraffe with malice.
"That sounds like a bright idea. But for how long shall I have to stay
in the pool? There are other things to do besides bathing in a pool, you
know", commented the Hippo ironically.
"Perhaps you will have to stay in the pool until you feel all right again.
At any rate, you cannot go on shivering like this indefinitely."
The Hippo grinned and shivered again, this time most disturbingly.
"Besides, rumour has it that the water in the pool has curing effects in
case one has been bewitched or poisoned," added the Giraffe.
Apparently the Hippo was convinced. "Let me try," he said, and
moved towards the crater. As he was about to descend the walls of the
crater he wondered what would happen. When he reached the pool he
hesitated. He stood on the verge of the pool and took out a little water
to find out just how warm it was. It did not appear to be too warm.
Certainly it was far from being hot. Without further investigation or
thought, the Hippo plunged into the pool.
Alas! His face and the rest of the body were badly burnt. His skin
blistered. Somehow he managed to close his eyes and get out of the
pool, screaming. Later the skin and the hair on it peeled off leaving the
Hippo a hairless animal.
Even though he was eventually cured, the Hippo is remarkably devoid
of hair. As a result of the burns, his face became distorted, rendering
him a really ugly-looking creature. The Giraffe, having watched what
had happened, walked away quietly amused.
To this day, whenever the Hippo remembers this incident, especially
how hot it became when he was in the pool, he rushes into a cool river
or a lake. Many times he comes ashore to look for food. But if ever
there is an animal he does not wish to set his eyes on, it is the Giraffe.

Why
the Ostrich
sticks
its
neck out
Drawing © Ibou Diouf, from Ethiopiques, Dakar
WHY is it that the Ostrich has such a long neck?
Long ago the Ostrich had an ordinary neck that was propor¬
tionate to the size of the rest of its body. The Ostrich made
friends with the Crocodile. Animals and birds that knew the behaviour
of Crocodiles approached the Ostrich and advised it not have anything
to do with the Crocodile. "A Crocodile is so unpredictable and unre¬
liable," commented an elderly animal.
The trouble with Ostriches is that even though they have voluminous
bodies, they have extremely tiny heads in which there are equally tiny
brains. This Ostrich would not listen to the advice of the rest of the
animals for, like other Ostriches, it was foolish.
The Ostrich, having ignored the advice of other animals, went to a lake
to drink. There it met its friend, the Crocodile, who had been looking
for food in vain and was very hungry. "Come closer, my friend", said the
Crocodile enticingly. "I am in serious trouble and I think that you
could help me out if only you would."
"What's the trouble?" asked the Ostrich sympathetically as it raised its
small head. "Maybe I can help you."
"One of my teeth is aching badly. I can hardly chew anything", com¬
plained the Crocodile.
"What do you want me to do then?" enquired the foolish Ostrich.
"I shall open my mouth widely", said the Crocodile, "and ask you to
put your head in it so that you may have a close look and tell me exactly
what is wrong with the tooth at the end of my left jaw."
"All right," agreed the unsuspecting Ostrich. As soon as the Ostrich
inserted its small head in the mouth, the Crocodile shut it and tried to
pull the Ostrich into the lake. Even though it was foolish, this Ostrich
was young and strong. In the effort to save its head, the Ostrich almost
pulled the Crocodile out of the lake.
The more they pulled in opposite directions, the more the Ostrich's
neck lengthened and the more the Crocodile came ashore. The Croco¬
dile gave up in the end and let go of the head. The result of this tug-of-
war was such that the Ostrich's neck had become many times Ipnger
than its original length. . On being released, the Ostrich ran fast to safety.
Up until this day the Ostrich is one of the fastest birds that walk
instead of flying. Its neck is unusually devoid of feathers and it is also
particularly long. The Ostrich prefers to keep away from rivers and lakes
for fear that it may find the Crocodile there.
>our adults. By collecting and print¬
ing the materials we are, in fact,
perpetuating adult education as it was
known by our forebears.
More research should be carried
out to find out how traditional educa¬
tion can be used to make today's
education more effective. The prac¬
tice of telling stories is dying out and
such innovations as radio are taking
its place. When the elders who
preserved such oral materials die, our
unwritten culture dies with them.
In this experimental programme,
then, we handled only traditional sto¬
ries. But many other aspects could
be treated, such as historical back¬
grounds (as remembered by elders);
outstanding personalities; songs;
maxims; riddles; poems; birth;
marriage and death ceremonies; and
proverbs.
The list of possibilities is long and
exciting. The United Republic of
Tanzania has more than 120 tribal
groupings, each with its own way
of life. Suppose only stories were
worked on and that about 30 of them
were gathered, and printed from each
tribal grouping. This would produce
3,600 stories for our adult readers.
Similar treatment of poems, proverbs,
etc., would provide a tremendous
amount of reading material bearing
the stamp of Tanzanian culture.
The United Republic of Tanzania is
a young nation, only 13 years old.
Before it attained political indepen¬
dence it was made up of many diffe¬
rent tribes and one of the tasks facing
us is to shape the former tribal group¬
ings into a united nation.
Fortunately, there already exists a
powerful unifying factor, namely the
Kiswahili language. Another great
force for unity is the traditional cul¬
ture in which Tanzania is so rich.
It is thus essential that we should
gather and print in Kiswahili all our
oral traditions so that they become
available to Tanzanians and to the
world at large.

A century and a half ago Panama
was the meeting place for a vast
"Continental Congress" which in its
aims and conception can be considered
a forerunner of today's international
organizations. The Congress was the
brainchild of Simon Bolivar, "The
Liberator of Latin America". (Left,
anonymous portrait of Bolivar painted
ON 9 December 1824, a high
narrow valley in the Peruvian
Andes was the setting for the
battle of Ayacucho, at which General
Antonio José de Sucre won a decisive
and irreversible victory over the only
remaining army of any consequence
Spain could still muster in South
America.
General de Sucre was the closest
comrade in arms of Simon Bolivar,
El Libertador (The Liberator) of Latin
America. His crushing victory at Aya¬
cucho was the culminating point in
the fifteen-year struggle for inde¬
pendence from Spain, which had
started in 1810 when a group
of patriots had seized power in
Caracas, and had spread, at the cost
of unrelenting strife and sacrifice,
from Venezuela and Argentina through
Colombia, Ecuador and Chile, to the
Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru.
Simon Bolivar was the man largely
responsible for winning political
independence for this vast landmass
and for shaping it into sovereign
republics. The immense task he under¬
took embraced every aspect of what
was, indeed, a genuine revolution.
By his vision and his action, he
personified the spirit needed not
only to achieve political indepen¬
dence through armed struggle against
the odds in a long-drawn-out war
with Imperial Spain, but also to lay
the foundations for the new and
complex organization of the new
States and to point to the direction
and role Latin America had to chart
for itself in the eyes of the world.
His own role was embodied in an
unrivalled combination of action and
reflection, in a sense of political reali-

Hispano-American literature at Columbia

ties and a vision of the future, where
forging new political institutions was
no less important than winning
battles.
In addition to having to contend
with the pressing day-to-day prob¬
lems of a new organization, he had
to define the status and identity of
Latin America to the complex inter¬
national order of which it had just
become a part, without the slightest
experience and with few resources.
Bolivar never regarded indepen¬
dence as a national or local issue.
In his viewand this is where his
genius laythe independence move¬
ment had to embrace the whole of
Latin America. It had to be founded
on close union and co-operation bet¬
ween the new States and take careful
account of political developments in
Europe and elsewhere in the world.
Significantly, two days before the
battle of Ayacucho, he wrote from
Lima to all the recently liberated
countries, inviting them to take part
in a congress whose purpose it would
be to establish the closest form of
union possible.
This was an idea he had had in
mind for a long time. As early as
1810 when, as a yet unknown young
man, he had been sent to London as
a member of the diplomatic mission
from the recently created Caracas
junta, he spoke to an English news¬
paper of his intention to call on all
the peoples of Latin America to unite
in a confederation.
This was an idea which the found¬

Bolivar sought to promote the unity
of Latin America by founding a great

by a common heritage and a common
ideal of liberty. Right, monument

setting up a Latin-American con¬
federation which they would be pre¬
pared to join at any time.
From the time he first took up arms,
Bolivar realized that it was necessary
not only to combine Venezuela and
present-day Colombia into a single
State but also to go further and
unite the whole of Spanish America.
In 1814, in the difficult and at times
inauspicious days when the armed
struggle was just beginning, he made
a statement proclaiming: "Our native
land is America".
In 1815, in the adversity of defeat,
living the life of an almost penniless
fugitive in Jamaica, he wrote one of
the most extraordinary documents in
Latin American political history. In
a letter to a correspondent on the
island, the publisher of an English
newspaper in Kingston, he drew an
uncannily accurate and penetrating
picture of Latin America as it then
was and as it would become.
In that admirable document, he
again stressed the conviction that
the new States had to be joined in
political unity. "More than any man
alive", he wrote, "I want to see Latin
America become the greatest nation
in the world, not so much on account
of its size and wealth as by virtue
of its freedom and its renown".
In a tone of prophecy and denun¬
ciation, he elaborated on his vision of
things: "It is an awe-inspiring idea
to want to shape the entire New
World into a single nation with a
single bond linking its parts to each
other and to the whole. Since it has
a common origin, a common lan¬
guage, common customs and a com¬
mon religion, it ought to have a single \

confederation of the different States
that have been created... What a
happy prospect it would be if the
Isthmus of Panama could be for us
what the Isthmus of Corinth was for
the Greeks.
"May the day come when we shall
be fortunate enough to convene in ,
Panama an august congress of the
representatives of the republics, king¬
doms and empires to consider and
discuss the higher interests of peace
and war with the rest of the world."
When Bolivar launched this singu¬
lar and momentous scheme, Latin
America had still a long way to go
before becoming fully independent.
Yet he had the extraordinary foresight
to seize on the idea that the unity of
the future States would provide the
mainstay for their own sovereignty.
He pointed to the historical links that
existed between the peoples emer¬
ging from the Spanish Empirethe
unity of their customs, language and
religionand expressed the belief
that the common heritage handed
down from the past ought to serve as
a firm and stable foundation to the
structure as a whole.
Bolivar even went on to advocate
the need to work for peace and co¬
operation through a permanent con¬
gress of all nations established in
Panama, which might become the
geographical focal point of world
politics. Mankind had to wait for
more than a century and suffered two
world wars before an organization
along the lines of that he had in mind
came into being with the creation of
first the League of Nations and then
the United Nations.
When the armed struggle was re¬
sumed, he wrote from the banks of the
Orinoco to the Argentine authorities
on the River Plate to announce that,
when the war had ended, he would
invite them to join in a single associa¬
tion so that the rallying-call could be
unity in Southern America. He ex¬
panded on this concept in the letter
accompanying his invitation, in which
he stated that all "Americans should

have only one homeland, since we
have achieved perfect unity in all
things."
When the fortunes of battle had
carried him from victory to victory and
he had welded Venezuela, New Gra¬
nada and Ecuador into the single
republic of Colombia, he dispatched a
group of plenipotentiaries to invite
the independent governments of
South and Central America and
Mexico to a congress at which the
foundations of unification were to be
laid.
The instructions he gave show
clearly that his intentions were not
confined to concluding a temporary
defence pact in, order to counter the
threat of a European invasion. The
old regimes which had fought against
revolutionary France had just organi¬
zed the Holy Alliance, to defend
absolute monarchy and the old social
structure. One of their first aims
was obviously to return the' liberated
colonies of Latin America to Spain.
Bolivar saw this attack on demo¬
cracy, the right of nations to deter¬
mine their own form of government
and the tenets of political freedom as
a universal issue, and he accordingly
set out to convince all the embryo
republics of the need for permanent
and unwavering unity. There can
be no doubt that he was thinking of
the example set by the union of
England's North American colonies
and the Congress that bestowed
lasting political unity on them.
As he explained to the envoys: "At
this moment, there is nothing more
important to the government of Co¬
lombia than the establishment of
an authentically American league of
nations. The proposed confedera¬
tion must not be inspired exclusively
by the idea of a conventional alliance
for defence or retaliation. On the
contrary, our association must be
more closely knit than that the Eu¬
ropean powers have recently created
in their attempt to deprive peoples:
of their freedom. Our association l
must be a league of sister nations, r

y "Although until now, owing to the
course taken by events, each of them
has exercised sovereignty individually:
if they are united, strong and re¬
sourceful, they can pull together in
withstanding foreign aggression."
"You must stress upon them how
necessary it is to make an immediate
start to laying the foundations for a
union of neighbouring States, an
assembly of plenipotentiaries that
would be capable of promoting the
interests of the American States and
of mediating in any disputes between
nations which, although having cus¬
toms and practices in common, may
perhaps, for want of so dedicated an
institution, spark off regrettable con¬
flicts such as those that have been
the scourge of other less fortunate
regions."
B
iOLIVAR'S view of the situation
inevitably invites contrast with
the opinion expressed by Presi¬
dent James Monroe of the United
States when he proclaimed his
famous doctrine. Whereas Monroe
confined himself to announcing that
the United States had decided unila¬
terally to oppose any attempt on the
part of the European powers to con¬
quer the New World, Bolivar visualized
the new republics as coming together
to form a permanent organization that
would concern itself not only with
defence but also with integration and
action in all fields.
Bolivar was thinking primarily in
terms of former Spanish America and
of organizing it with a view both to
averting the immediate threat and to
evolving a complete policy for the
future, including collaboration with
the United States and balanced rela¬
tions between the Americas as a
whole and the rest of the world.
Bolivar had to wait almost two
years, until military victory was com¬
plete and all the territory of the for¬
mer Spanish Empire had won inde¬
pendence, before urging his proposal
again.
He took this step on the eve of the
battle of Ayacucho, when he wrote
to the other governments from Lima
inviting them to take part at last in
the congress of Panama he had so
earnestly striven for.
In his long endeavours to create a
free America, Bolivar's thinking was
dictated by three main ideas. The
first was to create a tightly-knit
confederation, united in its political
action, of most of the countries which
had emerged from the dissolution of
the Spanish Empire and were closely
connected by history, language and
culture.
The second idea, which perfected
and enhanced the first, was to draw
up a sort of pact of assistance and
co-operation between all the Ameri¬
can States, including those with
different languages and origins such
as the United States, Brazil and Haiti.
The third and final idea, which was
more wide-ranging and exalted in
concept, was to create that "august
Congress" of all the governments of
the world in order "to consider and
discuss the higher interests of peace
and war".
His mind broke free from the narrow
confines of the commonplace and
strove to survey the destiny of his
people in the setting of world politics
and of its prospects and trends.
In view of the power wielded by
the Old World and the threat of the
Holy Alliance, much larger and more
powerful political units had to be set
up, as the English settlers had done
in the North and yet, at the same
time, allowance had to be made for
the fact that the countries of America
had situations and interests in com¬
mon with the States and groups in
the rest of the world.
In so many words, Bolivar was
visualizing a new international order
and a new balance of forces between
continents based on law and justice
in an endeavour to secure peace.
This made him an extraordinary pre¬
cursor" of the legal and political
movements that have risen to
prominence in the world of today.
Bolivar felt that what was needed
was what he used to call a "balan¬
cing of the universe"what we today
would call a new international order.
He observed that the newly liberated
countries of Latin America could not
achieve and maintain the full dignity
of their independence unless they
worked through a wide-ranging and
solidly-based confederation. Now
that he could act, he finally convened
the Congress* of Panama, thus giving
substance to a project that until then
had appeared to be a mere idealist's
dream.
THE following States were invited
to attend the Congress of
Panama: Colombia (which
consisted of the present-day Vene¬
zuela, Colombia and Ecuador) Mexico,
Central America (comprising Costa
Rica, Guatemala," Honduras, Nicara¬
gua and El Salvador), Peru, present-
day Bolivia, Chile, Argentina/ Brazil
and the United States. For various
reasons, the United States, Brazil, Ar¬
gentina, Bolivia and Chile were unable
to be present, although they had
accepted the invitation.
The extraordinary meeting eventually
took place in Panama City on 26 June
1826. The instructions of the dele¬
gation of Peru, which were those
dictated by Bolivar himself, laid down
the following major objectives:
The creation of a permanent con¬
federation, union and league, in both
peace and war, against any nation
attempting to dominate America in
part or as a whole. Mutual gua¬
rantees of independence, freedom
and territorial integrity. No conclu
sion of alliances with foreign powers
except by mutual agreement. Sub¬
mission of all conflicts to the perma¬
nent Congress without recourse to
war. Outlawing of the slave trade
and creation of a joint military force.
Lastly, condemnation of war and
conquest in the relations between
peoples and governments.
Bolivar wanted an organization that
would have the strength and inde¬
pendence to exert an influence on
local separatist movements. He
was thinking not only of a permanent
representative body to assume that
important function but also of the
creation of a standing army that
would not be directly answerable to
any one State. This principle was
accepted inasmuch as it was agreed
that a permanent force of 60,000
men and a confederate navy would
be set up with contributions from,
member countries.
This was the first time in history
that such a confederation had been
created to promote the union of free
nations through peace and progress
rather than to triumph in war.
AND yet this was not everything
Bolivar, was seeking. Men
with a narrow parochial out¬
look, who thought only of their imme¬
diate short-term interests, could not
countenance so far-reaching and
revolutionary a project and they intro¬
duced qualifications and restrictions
that largely distorted the true nature
of that noble enterprise.
Perhaps it was ahead of its time.
So forward-looking and purposeful
a vision of the destiny of Latin Ame¬
rica could scarcely be accepted in a
spirit of enthusiasm and good faith
by people with all the petty interests
and prejudices of a society which had
still not shaken off its backward
colonial past.
Bolivar's unstinting endeavours
did not live on after him. The his¬
tory of Latin America in the 19th
century was one of fragmentation
instead of union and confederation.
The prospects which he had outlined
could not have materialized at that
moment in time. . Today, however,
they have gained a new lease of life
and sound an overwhelming note of
urgency. The peoples of Latin Ame¬
rica are increasingly convinced that
they have to integrate and unite if
they are to make their presence felt
on the world scene.
Bolivar's thinking and acts and the
imposing project of the Congress of
Panama are the surest foundation
for this grand design. The masterly
lesson and undying example of a
century and a half ago concern not
Latin Americans alone but the host
of mankind in the Third World who
are now emerging in search of a
more just international order.

Letters
to
the editor
REACHING THE
LESS ABLE STUDENT
Sir,
As a result of work with lower
ability secondary school students
leading up to Universal Children's
Day, I wish to draw attention to a
very real problem associated with
materials and publications emanating
from the various agencies of the U. N.
The essence of this problem is concer¬
ned with the vocabulary and com¬
prehension level used in the publi¬
cations. Having previewed a wide
selection of materials I was disap¬
pointed to find the poor provision
afforded the less able student.
Disparaging remarks about "stan¬
dards" and surprise may greet these
remarks on what may appear a very
minor cause for complaint; especially
in the wider context of the "Cou¬
rier's" usual correspondence. This
can only be judged against the posi¬
tive aim of widening one audience
receptive to ideas and knowledge dis¬
seminated through U.N. publications.
I am aware that the "Courier"
seeks a wider audience than the
lower ability classroom, and under
usual circumstances such a letter as
this may not be considered relevant,
but the August-September 1976
"Destination Unesco" issue gives
rise to the issues involved. The
excellent comic strip idea fell short of
the mark simply because it was too
long, covered too much ground,
involving many complex concepts,
and thus alienated many students
initially drawn by the visual impact
and quality of presentation.
It is especially important that the
U. N. take the lead in this field as
other agencies, perhaps less objective,
are providing the only current source.
Wider recognition should be given
to "language levels" and the question
of "writing materials down" for lower
ability students everywhere.

BEWARE
OF STEREOTYPES
Sir,
My family has subscribed to the
"Courier" for nearly 15 years and
I have never written to thank you for
the pleasure and knowledge which we
have gained from it: the beautiful
reproductions of art objects, the
information about ancient and alien
cultures, the fascinating new scienti¬
fic discoveries, and always, whenever
a problem is discussed, information is
given about the various solutions
which are being tried.
I say to my friends: Subscribe to
the "Unesco Courier"; it is the most
informative and the most hopeful
magazine in the world. It really
makes me feel that we are one world,
that we do belong to one great
human community. I found the Au¬
gust-September, 1976 issue inventive,
colourful and designed to convey a
lot of information in brief, to "teach
by entertaining".
I observed that the little person
going on the adventure of discovery
comes "from 137 countries" but
"belongs to the world". He was
drawn in such a way that he could,
indeed, have come from almost any
country. But there was no mistaking
his sex: he is a little boy.
Your choice of a boy for this
voyage of discovery perpetuates in the
minds of readers the old and untrue
idea that little boys are more curious,
more adventuresome, more receptive
to knowledge, than little girls, and
this makes me very sad, particularly
since I realize that the stereotype is
so accepted that no one bothers to
question it.
True, the Indian Ocean appears
briefly, first in a traditional role of
damsel in distress, crying, and feeling
neglected. She becomes a source
briefly for some interesting informa¬
tion, but she does not make up for
the fact that the central seeker of
knowledge is a male child.
It would have complicated your
task, or the task of the inventive team,
man and woman, who devised the
issue, to draw a boy and a girl, but
I feel strongly that they should have
done this, or else flown in the face
of tradition and made the adventurer a
little girl. If the oppression of
women is the basic oppression on
which all others are based, then
instances such as your well inten-
tioned bias in your very instructive
little fiction cannot be overlooked.
Think about it.
Meanwhile, thanks again, and
best wishes for a millennium of peace
and new justice to all minorities,
including women, during which you
can continue your good work.

"DESTINATION UNESCO"
Sir,
I have read the "Unesco Courier"
since 1954. It has a responsibility
to bring within the purview of its,
readers throughout the world vital
and important social, cultural and
scientific events that make our
"Global village" unique and interest¬
ing.
The theme of the August-September
1976 issue of "Destination Unesco"
should never have appeared in a
regular number. It would have been
novel to issue it as a special booklet,
or to have published it as a paperback.
But the reduction of the written word
and information to cartoons in the
entire issue was, in my view, a monu¬
mental waste.
Save cartoons for those who cannot
view reality, and cannot perceive
without visual explanations in the
form of cartoons.
Jerome Frank Slezak
Lakewood, Ohio, U. S. A.
Sir,
If it is your intention to reach the
generation of plus or minus 10 to
16-year-olds, I think the creation of
the "Unesco boy" in your August-
September 1976 issue is perfect.
Never has an issue been so well read
(by all of our family) as this one.
Well done !
Pieter Lindenbergh
Rockanje, Netherlands
WHERE WAS
NASRUDIN BORN?
Sir,
Ivan Sop's article about Nasrudin
Hodja ("The World of Humour", April
1976) was most interesting, but the
author raises a point on which I
disagree with him: he doubts that
Nasrudin was of Turkish origin.
Efforts to trace the place and date
of birth of a folk hero in the oral lite¬
rature of any country may end up in
disappointment or lead to unjustified
assertions. However, according to
oral sources (backed up by various
texts) Nasrudin Hodja was born in
1209 in the Turkish village of H orto,
the son of a certain Abdullah and his
wife Sidika.
But let's suppose for a moment
that Nasrudin wasn't of Turkish origin
and that the tales about him come
from other places. In that case they
would have come via Islam and thus
through the Arabic or Persian lan¬
guages used by the learned of that
period. As part of scholarly literature,
they would thus never have reached
the level of peasant communities.
Yet they are recounted in a Turkish
which is absolutely pure and in which
no Arabic or Persian terms are used.
As for the spread of these anec¬
dotes "from Morocco to China" and
"from Siberia to the Arabian Penin¬
sula", most of those who carried them
from country to country were the
many peoples of Turkic origin, during
their migrations, as well as the
States and empires founded by these
peoples.
It is therefore unthinkable that
Nasrudin's origin should be lost
within the anonymity of the world
of Islam. The Turkic world is cer¬
tainly integrated therein, but has suc¬
ceeded in preserving its traditions
and its popular arts.

Unesco's 1977
poster-calendar
For, its 1977 poster-calendar, Unesco
has chosen a design by a young artist
from Mauritius, Imteyaz Hoosain
Sumodhee. The design symbolizes the
fourfold vocation of Unesco in the fields
of- education, science, culture and
communication represented as a single
stream of human endeavour. It was
chosen by an international jury of artists
from among 38 entries submitted by
competitors from African countries
south of the Sahara.
Growing world
water crisis
Reasonable supplies of drinking water
are unavailable for at least 1/5 of the
world's city dwellers and for 3/4 of its
rural people. The day is drawing near
when scarcity of water of acceptable
quality will become a crippling obstacle
to the well-being of mankind. It is in
order to stimulate world action on these
crucial issues that the United Nations
Water Conference will be held at Mar del
Plata, Argentina, from 14 March 1977.
Record sum
raised for
Unesco's Co-Action
Programme
On 7 January 1977 a special Unesco
award was presented to pupils of Belfast
Model School for Girls (U.K.) who in.
three weeks raised £ 1,310 for Unesco's
Co-Action Programme. Through this
programme schools, organizations and
individuals in the industrially developed
countries can assist self-help projects
in the developing world by means of
UNUM cheques (Unesco Unit of Money;
1 UNUM = $ 1) which they send direct
to the project of their choice. In the last
two years an estimated $ 380,000 worth
of UNUM cheques have been sold by
Unesco and by Co-Action sponsoring
organizations in 14 Unesco Member
States. Those wishing to know more

Angola, Mozambique, Papua-New Guinea
ahd the Seychelles were admitted to
Unesco at the 19th session of the Orga¬
nization's General Conference, held in
Nairobi (Kenya) from 26 October to
30 November 1976. This brings the
total number of Unesco's Member States
to 141. The youngest of these States,
the Seychelles became independent on
18 June 1976. A former British colony,
this archipelago of 80 islands in the
Indian Ocean has an area of 376 sq. km
and a population of 60,000. The capital
is Victoria on Mahé island.

Paris on 1 1 January 1 977 for a ceremony
marking the tenth anniversary of Inter¬
national Peace Day. This is the second
time that Unesco has been honoured in
