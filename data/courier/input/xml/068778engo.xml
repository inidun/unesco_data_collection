A great many countries continue to hurt themselves
and their people by import duties on educational, scien¬
tific and cultural materials. Duties are prohibitive on
every kind of scientific equipment, from test tubes and
measuring spoons to cyclotrons, a famous biophysicist
recently said. Countries fighting illiteracy and trying
to industrialize have barriers against books and teaching
aids. Regulations are complex, troublesome and often
illogical. Unesco has been working to abolish duties
on a wide range of such materials. (See story on page 25)

By one of those contradictions which the human mind
readily accepts, peoples described as "primitives" or
as "savages" are often hailed for their remarkable
scientific knowledge. They are said to possess secret
formulae which are far more effective than anything
used by modern chemists or doctors. Those who despise
primitive peoples yet speak with awe and admiration of
their almost supernatural knowledge, often display an
exaggerated naivety and credulity, but they are actually
closer to the truth than others who deny that primitive
peoples possess any science worth knowing about.
The Indians of South America may not have any "mir¬
acle drugs/' but it was they who discovered the qualities
of chinchona bark, of coca leaves and of the lianas from
which they make curare. The conquest of the tropics by
the white race would have been impossible without qui¬
nine ; the role of cocaine in modern surgery is known to
all. As for curare, an extraordinary poison which acts on
the nervous system, this is being put to ever greater uses
in neurology.
These three discoveries are indicated merely as examples
of our debt to the so-called primitive peoples, but the list
could be greatly extended if we considered other fields and
other parts of the world. It was also the "savages" of
the Amazon who revealed to the world the wonderful qua¬
lities of rubber and who first made practical use of them.
For long the methods used to transform latex from the
Hevea tree into rubber Were those of the Indians. Let
no one say that these were accidental discoveries and not
the result of scientific enquiries. To extract curare from
strychnos toxijera called for many long experiments and
lor qualities inherent in the true scientist : a keen sense
of observation, patience and the urge to experiment.
Is it necessary to remind those who, when speaking of
the Indians or of the peoples of Oceania, refer to them
as "savages" that these same men succeeded in mastering
their environment and that they possess an empirical
science in agriculture which agronomists are quick to
praise and to draw inspiration from.
Biologists have not always admitted the debt they owe
to "primitive" peoples who have made available to them
observations of the greatest precision and accuracy. It
is of course natural for a man who lives by fishing and
hunting to know the habits of his quarry down to the last
detail. Yet if in this respect "primitives" are valued
aides for the scientist it is also true that their ideas
on the development of living things are just as fantastic
as those of the naturalists of antiquity and even those of
the Renaissance. But their credulity and naivety are no
greater than those shown by the ancient Roman natura¬
list, Pliny the Elder.
This issue of The Unesco Courier devoted in part to
aspects of "science among primitive peoples" may in a
small way serve to remind those concerned with the edu¬
cation of "primitives" that they are not dealing with
backward or ignorant minds and that those to whom they
are today bringing the rudiments of Western science are
themselves capable of teaching lessons in many fields.
Let us remember too that the death of the "primitive"
civilizations which so many people advocate in the name
of progress, will also see the vanishing of much knowledge
that is not without significance for our own civilization.

NO 'HOCUS POCUS' IN
THE MEDICINE MAN
by Erwin H. Ackerknecht
The activities of the primitive medi¬
cine man are brushed away by the
average individual as "hocus po-
cus". This, of course, they are not.
They are actually magico-religious rituals
which always and in all places must
appear grotesque to those who do not
believe in the premises of such a ritual.
They are based on the idea that dis¬
ease is in most cases not produced by
natural forces, as it has been accepted
by us for the last two and a half thou¬
sand years, but by such supernatural
agencies as spirits, gods, ghosts and sor¬
cerers. These forces have been provok¬
ed by the patient or one of the members
of his family through actions contrary to
the moral code of the tribe. The super-
naturals will attack by injecting myste¬
riously disease-producing magic substan¬
ces or spirits, or by abducting the soul
of the patient.
It is quite logical that our methods
of diagnosis, based on observation of the
patient, could not reveal such super¬
natural causes, and that the primitive
diagnostician therefore has to rely on
the supernaturalistic techniques of divi¬
nation by trance, dreams, crystal-gazing,
bone-throwing, etc. It is equally logical
that therapeutics have to consist primari¬
ly of rites to force out spirits, placate
ghosts and gods, and hunt up displaced
souls. Such aims are best achieved by
incantations, spells and prayers, accom¬
panied by singing and dancing.
Effective psychotherapy
Ir is obvious that from the biological
point of view which is ours in the
case of disease such practices are
absurd and devoid of meaning. This
does not mean that they are devoid of
any meaning. They are, for instance,
quite meaningful from the psychological
and psychotherapeutic point of view. As
this aspect of primitive medicine is the
Dr. Ackerknecht is Professor and Chairman of
the Department ot History of Medicine at the
University ot Wisconsin, U.S.A. Previously he

University, New York (1941-1944) and Assistant
Curator, American Museum ol National History

pathology of primitives.
subject of a special article in this issue
(see page 8), I can be quite short on it
here. Suffice it to say that the two main
mechanisms of our own psychotherapy,
suggestion and confession, are used ex¬
tensively. By the very fact that disease
is made meaningful in terms of the
world view of the afflicted and that the
medicine man now substitutes for the
patient in fighting evil powers, anxiety
is dispersed, faith is established, energies
are mobilized and psychological, and
therefore physiological, relief is obtain¬
ed. It is beyond any doubt that many
of the undeniable successes of primitive
medicine men (like those of modern
doctors) are due to unconscious but
effective psychotherapy.
This season's 'miracle drug'
IN addition, the magico-religious ritual
of the medicine man contains at
closer scrutiny numerous elements
which will account for success beyond
psychotherapeutic factors. In the course
of such rituals, whether they take place
in the African bush, the South American
forest, or among the Navaho of arid
Arizona, magic potions are imbibed,
which very often contain highly effective
drugs, and magic manipulations and puri¬
fication rites are performed, which cor¬
respond largely to our own physio¬
therapy.
It so happens that the "miracle drug"
of this season, serpasil, so beneficial in
high blood pressure and mental disease,
is not a synthetic drug, like some of its
predecessors (the arsenicals, or the sulfa-
drugs), but is derived from a plant,
Rauwolfia serpentina, which, for de¬
cades, medical missionaries in Africa
had vainly pointed out to western phar¬
macologists as a very effective drug of
primitives.
Serpasil is only one of many drugs of
primitive origin which play an important
role in our present-day pharmacopoeia.
We mention here only such dramatically
effective specifics as strophantine, the
heart drug; emetine, used in amoebic
dysentery; and Picrotoxine, the stimulator
of respiration in barbiturate poisoning.
Cocaine and- quinine once came from
Peru. It would be useless to enumerate
here all the effective emetics, purgatifs,
expectorants, and diuretics known to be
used by primitives.
It is quite obvious that besides useless
substances, as they occur in all phar¬
macopoeias, even in our own, primitive
pharmacopoeias contain a surprising
percentage of effective drugs in spite of
the magic ideas which govern their use.
The Spanish conquerors of the 16th
century were sufficiently impressed by
the drug lore of the Indians to organize
research in this field. Modern science
has stood aloof from such studies among
the "superstitious heathen" for at least
a century. But lately, pharmaceutical
industry has been sufficiently impressed
by the potentialities of such studies to
spend a considerable amount of money
for research on primitive drugs. We
have no doubt that from those studies
will come forth further evidence of the
amazing and surprising knowledge- of
effective drugs possessed by primitive
peoples. How they acquired this know¬
ledge (they do not use our inductive
methods, and would in any case have
had a very hard time to do so) is
another problem, which so far has not
been solved, and whose discussion is
outside of the limits of this article.
Sweatbaths and drycupping
Drugs are not the only effective
therapeutic agents primitives use.
During their rituals, physical
agents of known value like baths of all
sorts (including sweatbaths), massage,
sucking (or drycupping) are frequently
and successfully applied. Except for
sucking which we have given up, we
still practise them all.
Primitives are less active in the field
of surgery than they are in drug treat¬
ment or physiotherapy. This is partly
due to irrational attitudes, especially
fear of mutilation, which is used by
them rather for punishment or ritual
than for treatment. But this is also due
to technological backward¬
ness which till a hundred (Cont'd on

CURARE: DEADLY KILLER TURNED HEALER
Among the many drugs and compounds known to primitive peoples and which modern
science has found dramatically effective in medicine and surgery, one of the strangest is
curare. Preparation of this deadly poison is still a closely guarded secret of primitive
tribes at opposite ends of the earthAmazon Basin and Borneo. Both Indians in South
America and Dyaks in Borneo use blow-pipes for hunting, though the velocity of the darts
they fire Is not sufficient to inflict fatal wounds. For many years these people have known
that a dart smeared with curare paralyzes its victim and brings rapid death to any animal
or bird it strikes. The knowjedge that curare blocks nerve impulses and produces muscle
relaxation has been put to use by modern medicine and surgery. The curare though has
first to be refined and its dosage carefully controlled. Some of its specific uses: to produce
muscular relaxation during surgical operations, to eliminate muscle pull in treatment of
fractures and dislocations; to relieve spastic paralysis and to prevent convulsions
being caused during electro-shock treatment sometimes given to mental patients.
Photos on this page and overleaf illustrate the use of curare In Borneo where Dyaks still manu¬
facture and use blow-plpes to shoot death-dealing darts at jungle game. (1) Between the leaves
of a giant jungle fern, a hunter spots a monkey. (2) A short, sharp puff and the dart shoots out so
swiftly that it cannot be followed in flight. (Cont'd on next page) Photos copyright A Martin

CROSS-LEGGED on platform, Dyaks take turns piercing tree
trunk, which takes about five days. With metal spike held in
wooden handle they strike base of trunk with slow up-and-down
movement. As they hollow out centre, they pause now and then
to make sure trunk has not moved from vertical position. When
finished, blow-pipe will be about 8 feet long, roughly diameter of a
horizontal vaulting bar and will be pierced by hole 1/5 th of an inch
across. With blade attached it becomes a spear. South American
blow-pipe (sarbacan) consists of two parts held by bark strips.

'COAT OF MAIL' worn by this old Dyak is a jacket of vegetable
fibres which serves as protection against poisoned darts. In Borneo,
as in South America, the preparation of curare is the privilege of
certain tribes. Witch doctors alone know the secret of its compo¬
sition. They surround it with mystery and perform intricate magic
rites as they mix an amazing number of ingredients. After simmer¬
ing for two days it is shaped into sticks which are then used for
barter with other tribes. To make it malleable, the huntsman
has to moisten it and then pound it with small wooden pestle.

PRECISION of blow-pipe is largely due
to skill and care with which Dyaks pierce
a tree trunk to make the tube. They
first build a platform about I I feet from
the ground, then with an ingenious system
of horizontal bars, they set up above the
platform a roughly squared tree trunk.
This will become the blow-pipe. Here,
two men put in place long iron spike
. which is to pierce tube of blow-pipe.
IN BORNEO, two different kinds of
curare are used"tadjum" on small darts
like knitting needles for birds, and "¡pu"
on darts with two barbs for bigger game.
As many as 20 ingredients are used to
make curare, but basis of "¡pu" is the sap
of the tree "antaria toxicaría", and for
"tadjum", the sap from the "tadjum" tree
and juice of "kaba" bark are used. Left,
a Dyak collects sap from "tadjum" tree.

surgeon consist primarily of wound and
fracture treatment. "Active" surgery,
which to us today is the essence of sur¬
gery, is a quite recent phenomenon even
in the West, appearing on a large
scale only after the invention of anes¬
thesia, asepsis and the localistic ap¬
proach in pathology. It is thus not
surprising that primitive surgery is
usually limited to lancing of boils,
blood-letting and what seems quite ef¬
fective wound and fracture treatment.
Caesarian operations
Occasionally primitives have in¬
vented quite clever devices like
the closing up of wounds with the
mandibles of large ants whose head is
broken off (Somalis, Brazilian Indians).
In a few regions surgery has developed
farther. The East African Masáis
amputate hopelessly fractured limbs and
enucleate eyes. From the same region,
drainage of empyema (pus resulting
from pleurisy) by cauterisation of the
thorax, excision of neckglands, removal
of uterine polyps, and suturing of the
intestine are reported. The Ellice
Islanders in Polynesia use shark teeth
to remove fatty tumours, the elephan¬
tiasis scrotum, tuberculous glands and
old ulcers.
The most baffling aspect of primitive
surgery is the successful performance of
. two operations, greatly dreaded by
Western surgeons up to the end of the
last century: Caesarian section and
trepanation. The former is reported
again from East Africa, the latter from
African regions, most of Oceania,
and the Americas, especially Peru.
In the field of obstetrics we must
admit that the more or less sitting
position during childbirth, adopted in
most primitive tribes, is considerably
more physiological than that customary
with us. Certain Eskimos and Bantus
have invented, independently, incubators
for premature babies, a technique
developed in the West only in the second
half of the 19th century.
Smallpox inoculations
It is the "superstitious" (that is magi¬
co-religious) fear of witchcraft
which makes many primitives hide
their excrements. Objectively such
actions, however they may be rationali¬
zed, are of considerable preventive value.
The same holds good of circumcision,
certain food taboos, taboos against early
intercourse after childbirth, fumigation,
ritual bathing, or isolation of infectious
diseases. Inoculation against snakebite
is practised by certain South American
and African natives, inoculation against
smallpox only by the latter. The South
American Yuracare, Guato and Me-
setene manufacture mosquito nets from
bark cloth, which should objectively be
of prophylactic value in mosquito-borne
diseases.
As we have seen, medicine in primitive
society is part of religion; it belongs to
the sphere of the sacred. Primitive
religion does not interpret nature on its
own terms, but as if man's relations with
nature were another set of personal
relations. Disease-producing influences
are not seen impersonally like our
bacteria or glands; spirits and gods act
like punishing parents, sorcerers like
aggressive siblings. These explanations
reflect the fact that, psychologically
speaking, man, an animal with an un¬
usually prolonged infancy, is first and
foremost impressed directly not by
nature, but by his social relations on
which his survival primarily depends,
and which he symbolizes thus in religion.
Disease in sacred terms
That medicine in primitive society is
couched in religious terms, symbo¬
lizing society, has an unexpected
and important consequence: medicine
and disease acquire social meanings and
social functions which they do not
possess in our society. The social
meaning of primitive medicine is easy to
spell out: Be peaceful, and disease will
spare you or go away.
Disease becomes the most important
sanction against asocial behaviour; fear
of disease and the .witch-smelling
medicine man play the role which the
fear of courts, policemen, newspapers,
teachers, priests or soldiers play in our
society. The fact that medicine is such
an important pillar of the social edifice
is perhaps the most influential of all the
reasons we have given in this analysis
of why primitives remain attached to
their medicine and their religion.
To the extent that medicine leaves
the sphere of the sacred and becomes
secularized, that disease is interpreted in
naturalistic, not supernaturalistic terms,
it loses its social meaning and its social
control function. Those who want to
bring Western medicine to people who
still regard disease in sacred terms, can
often be more successful in adapting
their practices to such sacred notions.
But, as Kipling said, this is another story.

WITCH DOGTORS
AND PSYCHOANALYSIS
by Claude Lévi-Strauss
Most of us regard psychoanalysis as a
revolutionary discovery of twen¬
tieth-century civilization and place
it on the same footing as genetics
or the theory of relativity. Others, prob¬
ably more conscious of the abuses of
psychoanalysis than of the real lessons it
has to teach us, still look upon it as one
of the absurdities of modern man. In
both cases, we overlook the fact that
psychoanalysis has simply rediscovered
and expressed in new terms an approach
to mental illness which probably dates
back to the earliest days of mankind and
which the . so-called primitive peoples
have always used, often with a skill that
amazes our foremost practitioners.
A few years ago, Swedish ethnologists
recorded and published a long healing
ritual used among the Cuna Indians of
Panama in cases of difficult childbirth.
In the ritual, the tribe's witch-doctor or
shaman stands before the suffering
mother and begins a chant-recitation,
explaining that her ailment is due to
the temporary absence of the soul which
controls procreation. The Cuna Indians
believe in the existence of a multitude
of souls, each of which has charge of
some particular function of life. In this
particular case, the soul has been kid¬
napped and has been carried away to
the other world by some evil spirits.
In quest of a
captive spirit
The witch-doctor tells the expectant
mother than he is setting out on a
supernatural quest for the lost
spirit. With a rare luxury of detail he
describes the obstacles he meets and the
enemies he has to face, how he over¬
comes them by force or guile before
reaching the prison of the captive soul.
Then he releases the soul and induces
it to resume control of the suffering
body lying at his side.
This cure (we have no reason to sup¬
pose it is not successful at least in certain
cases) is interesting for a number of
reasons. Firstly, it is purely psycho-

tes Etudes, and Secretary-General of the Inter¬
national Council of Social Science in Paris. He

logical; no drugs are used nor is the body
of the patient touched. The witch¬
doctor simply recites or chants, relying
on speech alone to effect his cure. Sec¬
ondly, two people must participate in
the treatment doctor and patient al¬
though, as we shall see in a moment,
this does not mean that other members
of the community may not be present.
Cures conducted
in public session
Of the two persons, the witch-doctor,
whose powers are recognized by
the whole tribe, embodies social
authority and order, while the other
the patient sufl'srs from what we
should call a physiological disorder, but
which the Indians attribute to an advan¬
tage gained by the spirit world over the
human world. Since these two worlds
should normally be allied, and since the
spirit world is of the same nature as the
souls possessed by the individual, the
problem as the Indians see it, really
stems from a sociological disturbance
caused by the ambition, ill-will or re¬
sentment of the spirits that is by both
psychological and social factors.
In describing the causes of the ailment
and recounting his adventures in the
other world, the witch-doctor conjures
up for his listeners familiar pictures
drawn from the beliefs and myths which
are the common heritage of the whole
community. Since the cures are con¬
ducted in public, the adolescents of the
tribe witness them and thus gain a
detailed knowledge of the tribe's beliefs.
Several of the characteristics described
are strangely reminiscent of psychoana¬
lytical treatment. Here too, illness is
considered of psychological origin and
the treatment applied is exclusively psy¬
chological. Because of symptoms which
he is unable to control, or more simply
because he is suffering from mental
stress, the patient feels cut off from the
community and calls in the doctor
whose authority is recognized by the
group, to help him to regain his place
in society. The- treatment seeks to
induce the patient to describe events
buried in his subconscious mind but
which, despite the passage of time, still
govern his feelings and attitude to life.

'POSSESSION' DANCES:
A TREATMENT FOR
MENTAL ILLNESS
Up until a short time ago "posses¬
sion cult" dancers were gener¬
ally considered fanatics indulg¬
ing in horrible excesses under a spell
brought on by frenzied collective
dancing. It is only in the last ten
years that scientists have begun to
take a closer look at the dances, par¬
ticularly in the light of our know¬
ledge of psychology and psycho¬
analysis, to see if they had a deeper
meaning than met the eye. After a
number of pioneer studies carried
out in Brazil and Haiti, investigators

The Unesco Courier
propounded the theory that the
possession dances were release mech¬
anisms or saiety valves designed to
enable the members of a group to
express the subconscious desires or
tendencies normally denied them in
their daily life.
Now a leading French psychiatrist,
Dr. Charles Pidoux, who has recently
returned from two expeditions to
Africa where he carried out a. series
of careful investigations into the
matter, has come forward with a new
interpretation. The possession rites
practised in the Niger and certain
parts of Africa, he concludes, are
techniques of very ancient origin
which constitute real psychotherapy
applied to mental disorders which are
attributed to the influence of tradi¬
tional "spirits" of the jungle.
In the Niger, he explains, river and
jungle spirits (called folley) are
considered the descendants of Adam
and Eve just as human beings are,
except that they are deprived of bod¬
ies. But though invisible, they are
alive and must borrow the body of
a person to manifest themselves.
The person chosen becomes the
spirit's "'horse", that is, the spirit
"climbs on his shoulders" and "'pos¬
sesses" him.
When a man or woman shows signs
of mental instability or behaviour
oddities, it means that one of the
spirits wishes to possess his body.
The individual visits a zima (priest
and doctor combined) who, after
initiation and conditioning lasting
sometimes as long as a year,
identifies the particular spirit and
prepares the new "horse" for the
dance ritual. As a result of the
possession dance the individual is
cured of his disorders and is enabl¬
ed to resume a normal life.
Photos on this page show several
"horses" in a possession dance film¬
ed in Africa. The men are unskilled
labourers at Accra (Gold Coast) who
originally came from the Niger. In
the Hauka sect to which they were
admitted after showing signs of psy¬
chotic disorders, the initiation lasts
a year. But after being "possessed"
they are cured at least for a long
period, but need to attend the cere¬
monies of the sect every Sunday.
"Independently of their religious
value and significance", writes Dr. Pi¬
doux, "these possession rites are a
rich field for studying a type of
psychotherapy in which a precise
knowledge of diagnosis, pathology
and therapeutic action are applied
with a rigour comparable to our mod¬
ern psychiatric treatment. It cannot
be denied that the mastery displayed
is most exceptional in a domain
where our own definite knowledge is
so much more recent."

PSYCHOANALYSIS
(Cont'd from page 8)
TRIBAL VERSION OF
PSYCHIATRIST'S COUCH
that the very recollection of them has
been lost, yet, better than more recent
events, they permit us to understand the
nature of things occurring today. These
stories are what sociologists call
"myths", and it would be difficult to
give a better definition of the word.
The main difference between the
medicine man's treatment (as in the
example of the pregnant mother above)
and treatment by psychoanalysis is that
in the first case it is the doctor who
docs the talking while in the second it
is the patient. A good psychoanalyst
we know, says hardly a word during
most of the treatment; his role is to
offer the patient a stimulus (one might
almost say provocation) which the pre¬
sence of another person provides, so
that the patient can vent all his pent-up
aggressive emotions on this anonymous
"other person".
Ready-made myth
calmed mother
IN both cases the creation of a myth
is part of the treatment. The differ¬
ence is that with the Cuna the myth
is ready-made, familiar to everyone and
perpetuated by tradition, the witch¬
doctor merely adapting it to each indi¬
vidual case.
In the childbirth case, for example, the
witch-doctor translates the myth into
terms that are meaningful to the
mother. This permits her to name,
then understand and perhaps thereby
dominate the anxieties which until then
she had been totally incapable of
expressing in any form.
In psychoanalysis, however, the
patient elaborates his own myth. When
we stop to think about it the difference
is not so great since psychoanalysis
reduces the causes of psychological
disorders to a very small number of
possible situations from which the
patient can choose, but do little more.
All of them deal with the patient's
earliest experiences in life and his rela¬
tions with his family as a child. Here
too, a state of release is reached when
the anxieties which the patient could not
express or dared not admit are at last
translated into terms of a myth which
fits his particular story.
To reassure psychoanalysts and their
followers, let me make it clear at once
that, in using the word "'myth", I am
in no way implying that the story in
question is either untrue or invented.
Many myths are based on real occur¬
rences but as I have already indicated,
what makes a myth depends not so
much on how accurately it reflects the
original story or event but its capacity
to give meaning to the present.

Thus it is not surprising to discover
that skilled psychologists who have
visited primitive societies to carry out
enquiries with the most up-to-date
methods of investigation, have found
themselves to be on a footing of equa-
.lity with the medicine man, and in some
cases have even acknowledged the latter's
superiority.
This was the experience of Dr. Kilton
Stewart, an American psychologist who
has given us a delightful account of it
in his book, Pygmies and Dream Giants
(New York, 1954). He had set off for
the interior of the Philippines to study
the mental make-up of the extremely
primitive pygmy tribes called Negritos.
His methods closely resembled those of
psychoanalysis. The witch-doctors not
only allowed him to do as he wished,
but immediately accepted him as one of
them; in fact, regarding themselves as
specialists with a thorough knowledge
of the techniques employed, they
insisted on helping him in his studies.
Dr. Stewart considers that in certain
respects their psychotherapy is even
ahead of ours.
I have already mentioned that the
treatment administered by the shaman is
given in public. Thus, all the members
of the community gradually acquire the
belief that any disorders from which
they themselves may eventually suffer
can be treated by the same methods they
have so often seen used. Furthermore,
since they know all the stages of the
treatment in advance, they are all ready
and willing to take part in it punctuating
it with words of encouragement, helping
the patient to marshal his memories, and
displaying an infectious enthusiasm as
the patient recovers from his disorder.
Negrito therapists
probe into the past
As Dr. Stewart observes in this
connexion, this takes, us beyond
psychoanalysis to one of its most
recent developments, namely, group
psychotherapy. One of its most familiar
forms is the psychodrama in which sever¬
al members of the group impersonate
the characters in the patient's myth in
order to assist him to see them more
clearly and thus bring the tragedy to an
end. This is possible only if the patient's
myth. itself is social in character. Other
individuals can play a part in it because
it is their own myth too, or to put it
another way, because the critical situa¬
tions in which individuals are liable to
find themselves in our society are broad¬
ly speaking, the same for all.
We thus see how deceptive it is to
think that the forgotten events which
psychoanalysis helps the patient to bring
back to mind, are something private and
personal. Even that difference between
psychoanalysis and shamanistic treat¬
ment, thus disappears.
"As in Paris and in Vienna", writes
Dr. Stewart, "the Negrito therapists were
helping the patient to contact patterns
, and incidents from a long-forgotten past,
painful incidents buried deep in the
early time layers of the accumulated
experience which made up the per¬
sonality."
Turn mental disorder
into creative talent
In one respect, at least, the primitive
system seems to be more daring and
more efficacious than our own. Dr.
Stewart describes an experience which
he might have had anywhere in the
world, among any of the peoples we like
to call primitives. When he was about to
rouse a patient from the waking dream
in which he was giving a haphazard
account of incidents in his past life
conflict with his father transposed into
the myth-form of a visit to the country
of the dead his Negrito colleagues
stopped him. To be definitely cured,
they said, the spirit of the sickness must
bestow a gift on its victim in the form
of a new drum beat, a dance or a
song. According to tribal theory, it is
not enough to remove the social infe¬
riority attributable to the illness: it must
be transformed into a positive advan¬
tage, a social superiority comparable with
that which we see in the creative artist.
This connexion between an abnormal
psychological balance and creative art
is not of course unknown in our
own theories. We have treated many
geniuses, such as Gérard de Nerval, Van
Gogh and others, as psychotics. At best,
we are sometimes prepared to pardon
certain follies because they are commit¬
ted by great artists. But even the poor
Negritos in the jungles of Bataan are
far ahead of us in this respect, for
they have realized that one means of
remedying a mental disorder, harmful
both to the individual suffering from it
and to the community which needs the
healthy co-operation of all, is to trans¬
form it into a work of art. This is a
method seldom used among us, though
it is to it that we owe the work of such
artists as Utrillo.
We have much to learn, therefore,
from primitive psychiatry. Still in
advance of our own psychiatry in many
respects, how far ahead it must have
been not so long ago (traditions die so
hard with us) when we knew no other
means of treating mental patients than
to put then in chains and starve them .

In the interior of . Indo-China,
isolated by the high mountains of
Viet-Nam, lives a primitive people
called the Mois. Primarily farmers,
their life depends on their rice crops.
To propitiate the "'good spirits" of
the rice harvest, one of the tribes, the
Sedang, has invented a unique music¬
al instrument, the construction of
which requires considerable know¬
ledge of music, mechanics and
hydraulics.
The instrument is a giant bamboo
carillon (1) actuated by running
water diverted into a bamboo tube
from a nearby stream (4). The con¬
tinuous power supply enables the
carillon to play uninterruptedly for
months at a time. The Sedang are
convinced that the rice spirits will be
pleased by the music played in their
honour and that the crop will be
; plentiful. They know too that the
: noise of the carillon will scare away
animals from the growing rice.
The carillon operates only during
the months of the rice season,
after which it Is abandoned. As
the Sedang tribe chooses a fresh plot
of land for rice growing each year,
a new carillon playing a different
tune is built.
The carillon of the Sedangs com¬
prises 50 bamboo pipes each of a
different length and thickness which
are struck by 50 hammers made of
bamboo. The pipes, which are some¬
times as much as 150 feet in length,
are suspended vertically in a frame¬
work measuring 50 feet by four feet.
The horizontal hammers are held
at one end by posts fixed in the
ground (3). The free ends of the
hammers are linked by cords to a
movable frame fixed overhead, which
is attached by a liana to a kind of
scoop placed under the tube of
running water.
When the scoop is filled with
water (4) it goes down and
swings over, pulling on the
cord which works the movable frame
and in turn on the fifty hammers
which simultaneously strike the
bamboo sounding pipes. A large
rock (5) acting as a counterpoise
immediately brings back the mov¬
able frame to its original position.
Thus a continuous movement is set
up. (The blurred effect in the centre
of photo N° 2 shows the movement
of the hammers). Each day the
"carillon master" comes to "tune" the
tubes and adjust the hammers (1).

GIGANTIC STATUES on Easter Island amazed Dutch voyagers who first saw them. Their leader, Jacob Roggeveen, wrote: "We could not
understand how a people deprived of stout spars and ropes could have raised them upright." A good 300 statues may once have dotted the island
but many, carved in soft stone, have disappeared. Some are over 30 feet high. Their purpose and mode of transport are still shrouded in mystery.

STRANGE HIEROGLYPHS have been discovered on Easter
Island. Most are engraved on wooden tablets (far left) or other
wooden objects such as fish (below). They depict human beings,
birds, fish, plants, shellfish and ceremonial objects but so far
no definitive evidence as to their meaning has been discovered.

SIMILARITIES between Easter Island writing and that of
ancient China and the ancient Indus Valley civilization have been
noted by a Viennese scholar who concludes that Easter Island
writing had been transported to Pacific from Central Asia or
Iran via Southern China. In columns, on left, are (a) Indus
writing; (b) Easter Island symbols; (c) Ancient Chinese writing.

Ever since a Dutch vessel chanced
across it two centuries ago,
Easter Island, no more than a
speck in the vastness of the South
Pacific, has intrigued the world with
mysteries which have so far been
only partially and tentatively ex¬
plained. For long the principal
mystery of Easter Island lay in the
colossal statues which still dot the
bare slopes of the Rano-Raraku vol¬
cano and which once stood in far
greater numbers like sentinels over
the mausoleums along the seashore.
In my opinion the greatest "mys¬
tery" of Easter Island
is not to be found in
the crop of colossal sta¬
tues. There is no doubt
that it was the ances¬
tors of the present Po¬
lynesian inhabitants
who hewed out these
statues and dragged
them to their present
sites, abandoning tne
workshops where they
carved them perhaps
only three or four
centuries ago. How¬
ever, no one has yet
been in a position to
give a satisfactory ex¬
planation for what appears to be a
form of writing among a population
still living in the Stone Age.
This writing first came to light
around 1860 when the people of the
island, newly converted to Christi¬
anity, sent the Bishop of Tahiti, a
Monseigneur Jaussen, a long cord
braided from their own hair and
wound around an old piece of wood,
as proof of their devotion. Looking
casually at the improvised spool, the
Bishop Was surprised to see that it
was covered with small figures, all of
the same height and carefully ar¬
ranged in straight lines which re¬
minded him of Egyptian hieroglyphs.
He wrote to the missionaries on
Easter Island asking them to look
for other tablets and to try to deci¬
pher them.
Brother Eyraud, the first mis
sionary to go to the island, had
already noticed carved wooden sticks
in the huts while Father Sumbohm
had picked up a fragment of a worm-
eaten tablet. Seeing how interested
he was in this object, one of the
islanders brought him a large tablet,
perfectly preserved. . Since then,
other tablets have been found on the
island and now total 24, including
one large wooden rod covered with
hundreds of symbols.
At the time when the first, tablets
were discovered, it would probably
have been possible to obtain the key
to the mystery from the surviving
members" of the priestly caste. The
old civilization of Easter Island had
only recently collapsed as a result of
the raids made by Peruvian slave-
traders, but there were still a few
"wise men" who, had they been
questioned, could have explained the
meaning of the strange symbols
covering these tablets.
Unfortunately, the missionaries
were not skilful investigators. They
questioned the islanders who, at the
sight of the tablets, began to intone
chants, instead of "reading" them.
The missionaries treated them as
frauds and lost interest in the matter
after a few unsuccessful attempts.
Mgr. Jaussen, however, was more
persevering. In Tahiti, he found an
Easter Islander, called Metoro, who
had learnt the mysteries of the
tablets under a famous master. The
Bishop handed him a tablet and
asked him to "read" it. Metoro turn¬
ed it this way and that and suddenly
began to chant. He "'read" the
tablet from left to right, then from
right to left, without bothering to
turn it round, although in each line
the signs are upside down in relation
to that preceding or following.
Jaussen took down the text as
Metoro recited it, and his manuscript
has recently been published. If each
phrase is compared with the corres¬
ponding symbols, it appears that
what Jaussen had
taken to be a connect¬
ed text is simply a dis¬
jointed succession of
brief descriptions of the
symbols viewed by his
interpreter, and a se¬
ries of isolated words
or phrases suggested
by those symbols. There
is no logical develop¬
ment or general sense
in the chant or recital.
Mgr. Jaussen ended by
losing heart himself
and abandoned h i s
efforts to get to the
bottom of a mystery
which he might otherwise have
managed to unravel.
Other attempts Were made to
extract from the islanders inform¬
ation which might have made it pos¬
sible to fathom the system underlying
the symbols. On a visit to Easter
Island in 1886, an American paymas¬
ter, Mr. W. Thomson, was taken to
the house of an old man called Ure-
Vaeiko, who, in his youth, had attend¬
ed the school of the Tangata rongo-
rongo (singers or bards) and had
learnt to read the tablets. As it hap¬
pened, Ure-Vaeiko, having become a
good Catholic, did not wish to make
even a momentary return to the
former heathen practices, and fled.
He was recaptured one
stormy night in the open (Cont'd on

THE REAL MYSTERY OF EASTER ISLAND
(Continued)
the tablets themselves, at least photo¬
graphs of them. He had recognized
them by certain details and recited
their contents from end to end
without a moment's hesitation. It
was noticed, however, that he was
not paying attention to the number
of symbols in each line and, worse
still, that he did not even notice it
when the photographs before him
were surreptitiously changed. He
went happily on reciting hymns and
legends until he was accused of being
a fraud.
Responsibility for these lost oppor¬
tunities lies, not with the islanders,
who appear to have acted in good
faith, but with the early investigators,
who were incapable of imagining a
system of writing different from their
own and were bent at all costs on
having the tablets "read".
During my stay on Easter Island in
1934-35, I tried to discover, in the
memories of my informants, some in¬
dication, however vague or apparently
insignificant, which might have put
me onto the right track ; but it was
all useless. The people assured me,
indeed, that the tablets were similar
to the "cat's cradle" patterns, each
of which suggests a chant to the
viewer. This interpretation tallied
with the attitude of the natives of
the last century who, when asked to
"read" the tablets, simply recited a
poem or intoned a chant. I conclud¬
ed that the tablets were mnemonic
pictographs used in reciting the
genealogies and long sacred hymns
which form a very large part of the
Polynesian liturgy. I was all the more
inclined to this interpretation be¬
cause, in the Marquesas, which are
probably the original home of- the
Easter Islanders, the singers or bards
associate their liturgical poems with
small fibre pouches from which hang
thin knotted cords. It was therefore
possible that each symbol on the
tablets represented a sentence, a line
or even a stanza.
Two script sleuths
This, then, was the supposition at
which I arrived and which was
accepted by other ethnographers.
However, I have been less sure that
my interpretation is correct since a
letter from a German anthropologist,
Dr. T.S.Barthel, suggested to me that
it was something far more complicated
than mere picture-writing, and that
the system used by the Easter Island¬
ers was a real script, partly ideogra¬
phic and partly phonetic, employing
the rebus in somewhat the same way
as the Mexican and Maya scripts. It
consisted of symbols indicating the
general meaning of a sentence and
suggesting a number of catchwords.
It will be impossible to decide whether
the long-standing riddle has finally
been solved until Dr. Barthel's book
is published, but his findings are con¬
vincing and decisive progress seems
to have been made towards decipher¬
ing these texts.
No article on the "hieroglyphs" of
Easter Island would be complete
without some reference to the com
parisons drawn by Mr. Hevesy, a Hun¬
garian linguist, between certain of
the Easter Island symbols and those
of a still undeciphered script which
has been discovered among the ruins
of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, two
ancient cities of the Indus Valley
where a brilliant civilization flourish¬
ed some six thousand years ago.
Link with the Lolo ?
An Austrian scholar, Professor Hei¬
ne-Geldern, considers it doubtful
whether there is a direct
connexion between these two scripts,
since the number of symbols differing
is greater than that of the symbols
which are similar. His archaeological
research had led him to believe that
the Polynesian civilizations originated
in China, and it was therefore in that
country that he sought the first begin¬
ning of this system of writing. Com¬
paring the symbols of the Indus cities
and Easter Island with those of the
ancient Chinese writing with which
we are familiar through inscriptions
on shells and bones dating back to
2,000 B.C., he found that some of the
symbols were common to all three
scripts. He concluded that the writ¬
ing of Easter Island had been trans¬
ported to the Pacific by a people from
Southern China, having a system of
writing which must have originated
in Central Asia or Iran.
Heine-Geldern has also compared
the Easter Island writing with the
pictographs which are still used
among the Cuna Indians in Panama,
while the famous prehistorian, Dr.
Koenigswald, has pointed out similar¬
ities between the Easter Island sym¬
bols and certain drawings on fabrics
found in Indonesia. An Argentine
scholar, Dr. Imbelloni, has compared
the Easter Island symbols with scripts
found in Ceylon and with that of the
Lolo of South China.
I think it is fairly easy to dis¬
cover startling similarities between
scripts of the pictographic type. The
very fact that it is so easy should put
us on our guard. Whatever the true
nature of the symbols on the tablets,
it is certain that the scribes who
made them sought their models in
the natural and cultural environment
of Easter Island.
To me, all the indications seem to
be that the writing of Easter Island
was invented in that remote little
island, probably on the basis of some
mnemonic system brought by the an¬
cestors of the Easter Islanders from
their original home. If it is proved
that these symbols are indeed hiero¬
glyphics which can be "read," then
the Easter Islanders, who have
already amazed the world by the qua¬
lity of their art and the impressive
proportions of their monuments, could
claim the additional honour oí hav¬
ing made a decisive step forward in
the development of civilization.
Alfred Metraux's career as a practising ethnologist
has taken him over most of Latin America and
the South Sea islands. He is the author of a
book on Easter Island, due to appear in English
in October.
FANTASTIC FIGURES and symbols were
found carved on rocks at Easter Island in 1934
by a Franco-Belgian research expedition which
included Dr. Metraux. Stylé and subject of
carvings (below) are often same as those on
Island's mysterious wooden tablets showing
human beings, fish and turtles. Cliffs at
Orongo village contain many carvings of
"bird-men" (above). Village was once centre
of a "bird-man" cult. Carvings were outlined
with chalk before they were photographed.

Polynesian navigators :
CHAMPION EXPLORERS
OF THE VAST PACIFIC
by Edwin Grant Burrows
First inhabitants of the mid-Pacific islands were the Polynesians the world's most daring deep-
sea voyagers and explorers. They found and populated every habitable island in the vast expanse
bounded by Hawaii on the north. New Zealand on the south, Easter Island on the east, and
Tonga and Samoa on the west. The word Polynesia means "many islands" those which form
triangle shown on map (right). Dotted lines crossing to South America show route by which
Polynesians are thought to have-travelled from Marquesas to Peru. Above, 18th century engrav¬

Astronomy is the most ancient of the sciences, and still
the most accurate in its predictions. Applied astrono¬
my has been vital to man for thousands of years:
for landsmen in agriculture, giving them foreknowledge of
seed-time and harvest; and for mariners in navigation,
showing where to point the prows of their ships so as to
make a landfall. Of all the peoples who have found their
way about the earth with the aid of this kind of applied
astronomy, the Polynesians have the best claim to be called
world champions.
To us of European tradition that seems a bold statement.
How about Columbus? How about the earlier Vikings, Moors,
Phoenicians ? There is no wish here to dim their glory ;
they have earned it all. Yet Columbus had the compass and
a forerunner of the sextant ; besides, he sailed centuries
later than the explorers famed in Polynesian legend. As for
Vikings, Moors, even Phoenicians with their fabled circum¬
navigation of Africa/ all their feats were coastwise sailing
compared with the Polynesian ventures through the widest
of oceans.
There is still some doubt as to when Polynesians first
landed on the islands where European explorers, pushing
out into the Pacific at least a thousand years later, found
them established. Some doubt, too, as to where they started,
and what route they followed. At present the most likely
answer seems to be that they did not all come at once, but
at various times, and along more than one sea-lane.
The question as to the general direction of their shoving-
As an ethnologist. Professor Burrows has studied native cultures in Polynesia
and Micronesia and is the author of many articles and monographs, including
"Songs of Uvea and Futuna", "Hawaiian Americans", and "Western Polynesia".
He is now Associate Professor of Ethnology at the University of Connecticut.

off place has seemed easier to answer. It must have been
mainly one region, for they are, broadly speaking, one
people ; from Hawaii in the north to New Zealand in the
south, and from Easter Island in the east to little islands,
scattered among larger ones of different population, in the
west. The usual answer has been that they came from the
west ; that is, from the direction of south-east Asia.
But now comes Thor Heyerdahl, who with his intrepid
crew sailed the raft "'Kon Tiki" from Peru to Polynesian
Raroia. That voyage, which he recounted in a memorable
tale that will surely hold its place among stories of men
against the sea, was only part of an enormous piece of re¬
search into Polynesian origins. His answer to the question
"'Whence the Polynesians?" is given in the title of a volume
of more than 800 large pages, published in 1952: "'American
Indians in the Pacific."
To sift the evidence for his claim that the Polynesians
came from America would take at least 800 pages more.
Failing that, it may be worth while to list impressions left
on a student of Polynesia by a re-perusal of the work:
(1) No one can examine this monumental treatise without
admiring the industry, determination and ingenuity that
went into it.
(2) The data are presented, not in the manner of a judge
or dispassionate scientist displaying the facts to let them
lead where they may, but in that of an advocate, using all
his powers to put his case in the best light and belittle that
of his adversaries. (Admittedly the adversaries have often
done the same.)
(3) Throughout the discussion, the possibilities of local
development and of convergence, whereby devices of dif¬
ferent origin come to look alike, are either overlooked or
lightly dismissed; as if human beings could never invent

anything more than once. (But demonstrably they often have.)
(4) Despite many dubious details, the cumulative evidence
of early contact between Polynesia and South America is
convincing ; and it may well have been more important than
most Oceanists have been willing to admit.
(5) The preponderance of evidence still indicates that the
Polynesians and their culture came originally from the vi¬
cinity of south-east Asia.
(6) The claim of early influence on Polynesia from north¬
western North America is unconvincing.
(7) Finally, research of this sort is a perfectly respectable
occupation. Yet to an anthropologist who has abandoned
an archaeological point of view for sociological and psycho¬
logical interests, it is deplorable to see good time and brains
wasted on problems that concern only the remote past and
can never be settled beyond doubt ; and this when many
timeless problems and urgent present ones, are crying for
solution.
One such problem lies before us, involving the past indeed,
but leading into the timeless question of man's adaptation to
his environment. Not when and whence did the Polynesians
come, but how did they manage? It is beyond dispute that
they made at least two voyages of some two thousand sea-
miles with perhaps only one stop-over; made them, returned,
and repeated them. These voyages were from the Society
Islands,, evidently a centre of dispersal for Polynesian cul¬
ture, to Hawaii, perhaps by way of the Marquesas; and from
the Society Islands to New Zealand, in all probability by way
of Rarotonga in the Cook group.
What puts these voyages past dispute? First, the fact that
the first Europeans to land at Hawaii and New Zealandin
both cases under the British Captain James Cook found
them already populated. Second, the fact that both had
traditions of ancestral voyages from islands the New Zealand
Maoris called Hawaiki and Tawhiti, the Hawaiians Hawai'i
and Kahiki. Third, the matter was investigated in the islands
of those names in the Society group: Hawai'i (the ancient
name ; now Raiatea) and Tahiti (Tawhiti, Kahiki). Sure
enough, they had corresponding traditions of the same voya¬
ges with the same leaders ; and genealogies in all the island
groups checked back fairly well to ancestors credited with
manning pioneering canoes. Fourth, comparison of cul¬
tures of three island groups confirms the close relations.
How did they do it? Unfortunately, that question is easier
to ask than to answer. Great overseas voyages had ceased
long before Captain Cook appeared, though he did learn
something about native navigation. And by the time the
matter was investigated more thoroughly, still more had
been forgotten.
Some have offered highly speculative answers. No less an
authority than Admiral Hugh Rodman, U.S. Navy, thought
one out from a huge gourd preserved in the Bishop Museum
at Honolulu. The smaller end has been cut off, leaving the
top of the gourd open. A row of small holes runs all the
way around just below the upper rim. Hawaiian tradition
credited this gourd or calabash with supernatural powers
concerned with navigation.
In an article entitled "The Sacred Calabash," published
in the Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute (1928), Admiral
Rodman suggested that the ancient navigators had filled the
gourd with water and used the holes below the rim, in con¬
nexion with the level of the water, to obtain a true horizon
to fix their position and plot their course.
Unfortunately, Admiral Rodman did not
know enough of the tradition. Mrs. Lahiláhi next page)

calabash most of her life. The holes below the rim were
for lashings, to hold on a lid, which she remembered but
which had since disappeared. The calabash was used to
hold, not water, but wind all the winds. By opening the
lid a little and intoning the right chant, an expert could
call forth whichever wind he needed. Moreover, Mrs Webb
added, she knew the chant. But some unauthorized per¬
son had taken off the lid; so all the winds escaped; and
that is why the weather is now uncontrollable.
Quite recently the hints to be found in old chants, early
European accounts and surviving myths and traditions,
have been assembled and analyzed by the astronomer
Maud Makemson in her book "'The Morning Star Rises :
an Account of Polynesian Astronomy" (New Haven, 1941).
Whatever can be made out of the scraps available, she
has set down. In some respects, one fears, she has set
down more than can be made out with all certainty. Yet
several points are beyond doubt.
In pre-European times the Polynesians had a consider¬
able knowledge of the heavenly bodies and their move¬
ments, varying in some details from one island group to
another, yet consistent in the main. They had a calendar
based on the annual northward and southward motions
of the sun. The year was divided into months, each
subdivided into "nights of the moon," from the moonless
night through all the waxing and waning until another
dark of the moon. The moons were distinguished from
each other by the rising of specified constellations.
The astronomic lore of which the above is an outline
was treasured especially by navigators, who exchanged
information on guiding stars, landmarks, currents, and
winds with their colleagues in whatever islands they
visited, in the season of variable winds, a navigator could
sail out for a day or several days, steering by a given
star ; then, if he sighted no land, return when the wind
shifted. It is evidently by some such method that the
Polynesians gradually explored the Pacific.
Some voyagers, exceptionally bold or else desperate be¬
cause of some trouble at home, set off on longer sorties
into unknown seas. Others, storm-driven, made long
voyages unintentionally. Of such pioneers, voluntary or
not, many doubtless never found land ; and of those who
did, not a few never found their way home again. Yet,
through the generations and centuries, enough voyages
were successfully completed and retraced to build up a
body of sailing directions which at last, during the great
age of navigation, made most of the Polynesian Islands
accessible to each other.
As to the particular long voyages chosen as examples,
Dr. Makemson concludes, by combining astronomy and
mythology, that the pilots steered from the Society Islands
'FROM ACROSS THE SEA'. At time
of discovery of America, the Mantas Indians,
living on what is today coast of Ecuador,
used rafts of balsa wood with vertical sails
like those of Polynesians. Legends of the
Mantas Indians told of landing on their
coast by "men who came from across the
sea". The first Spaniard to see a giant
balsa raft carrying 50 tons of goods in
the 16th century was Bartolomé Ruiz.
From afar he took it for a Spanish caravel.

Nuovo", published in Venice in 1 527.

Spica as morning star, and continued on the same course
until they reached the latitude of Hawaii, which they
recognized by the appearance of Aldebaran just over the
sea. Thereafter, she finds, they turned sharply westward
and ran before the trade wind, following an evening star,
probably Venus, until they saw on the clouds at night the
glow of an active volcano in Hawaii.
From the Society Islands to Rarotonga the most likely
guiding star is Antares or Fomalhaut, "or by steering a
few degrees south of the sun or Venus on the western
horizon when near the December solstice." From Raro¬
tonga to New Zealand, one tradition says "Venus by night,
the sun by day." Another names Antares. Dr. Makemson
finds that both would lead too far west. This problem
remains unsolved. Yet there is no question about the fact
that Polynesians, steering by the stars, did repeatedly find
their way to New Zealand.
Much clearer information is obtainable from Micro¬
nesia. In the western Carolines the old lore of navigation
is still remembered and, at least in some more remote
atolls, still used. The writer had the good fortune to
spend several days taking sailing directions from the
leading navigator of one of these atolls. Sitting with a
compass between us (for Ifaluk, as the navigator was
called, had worked on British and American ships, too),
we worked out a celestial chart with 32 stars on it, going
all round the compass, and names of islands to which
they would lead.
Most spectacular of Micronesian aids to navigation were
"stick maps," known only to the Marshall Islanders, but
made and used by them up to the first decade or so of
the 20th century. These consisted of strips of coconut
leaflet midrib lashed together in a rigid frame, with both
straight and curved lines, and small white shells repre¬
senting islands. They were of three main kinds: -one
used as a teaching davice ; another an outline of the
whole Marshall group or a large part of it ; the third rep¬
resenting in more detail a few nearby islands and seas.
Only one source, and that not of the best, says that
guiding stars were shown on the map. More likely, un¬
less in some exceptional case, they were memorized sep¬
arately. Distances and directions were not accurate
enough to steer by ; indeed it would have been a disgrace
for a navigator to consult such a map while at sea. They
were used to refresh memory while planning a voyage.
These details from Micronesia suggest some of the re¬
sources possibly included in the now forgotten navigation
lore of the ancient Polynesians. Whatever its shortcom¬
ings, it served to bring the first settlers to islands widely
spread in the Pacific, which their descendants still occupy.

European explorers who opened up Americas in 1 6th century found that Indians were skilled metal workers, having used gold to make
ornaments and to decorate religious objects and weapons for some 2,000 years. First engravings depicting exploitation of gold in New
World appeared in 1590. They were published by Theodorus de Bry, German engraver and publisher. De Bry visited London, where he met

Civilizations
of gold
and copper
by Paul Rivet
It is sometimes said that when
America was discovered, the
people were still living in the
Neolithic or polished stone age. This
is only partially true, for many of the
native peoples Were in fact familiar
with the use of metals, though the
regions in which metals were known
did not form a single group.
Among the different divisions into
which they can be placed, the first
was North America. The Indians liv¬
ing there used copper from the Great
Lakes area and possibly also from
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,
Connecticut, New Jersey, Arizona,
New Mexico, Nova Scotia and even
Mexico and Cuba. This copper was
cold-hammered and, sometimes, re¬
heated and then hammered again.
The second large area of metal
working covered the whole of Central
Professor Paul Rivet, former Director ol the
Musée de l'Homme, Paris, has devoted more than
hall a century to the study of the ancient peoples
of the Americas and the Indian civilizations of
today. His many works include Recherches
Anthropologiques sur la Basse-Californie, Ethno¬
graphie Ancienne de l'Equateur and L'Orfèvrerie

America, Colombia, the West Indies
and the southern tip of Florida, the
Guianas, Venezuela and, in general,
all the land north of the Amazon and
all the territories constituting the old
Inca Empire. This region was not a
single unit but a complex group of
different components.
Gold and copper were generally
used throughout the area, so that,
from what we know today, it is im¬
possible to say where these metals
were first discovered and how the
idea of using them spread throughout
the region. There may well have
been two centres of discovery, one in
Peru and the other in the hinterland
of the Guianas. Gold was undoubted¬
ly used before copper, since it makes
its appearance on the Peruvian coast
in early Nazca times (dated by the use
of the carbon 14 radio-isotope as
2,211±200 years ago), and in the
northern Cordillera of Peru at the
beginning of the roughly contempor¬
ary Chavin civilization, while copper,
which was unknown in Proto-Nazca
and Chavin times, was not introduced
into Peruvian metallurgy until the
advent of the Tiahuanaco civilization

about the fourth century of our era.
Throughout the north-eastern area
(the West Indies, Florida, the Guianas,
Venezuela and the territories north of
the Amazon), in Colombia, in the
northern and maritime provinces of
Ecuador, and on the Peruvian coast,
copper was only rarely used for mak¬
ing tools and did not appear on a
large scale except in combination with
native gold, while in the specifically
Inca area it was principally used,
either in the pure state or alloyed
with tin, for utilitarian purposes.
The working of gold and a gold-
copper alloy known as tumbaga was
most highly developed in Colombia,
the Isthmus of Panama and Costa
Rica. There are good reasons for
believing, however, that tumbaga was
discovered not in Colombia but much
further east, in the hinterland of the
Guianas, among the Arawak and
Carib tribes of the region, who called
it guanin and karakoli respectively.
These tribes, or one of them, must
have introduced the alloy into the
West Indies, Florida, and Colombia.
The Colombian goldsmiths develop¬
ed many new techniques, including a
special colouring process, used on
alloys of copper and gold to imitate
gilding, gold plating, autogenous
welding, soldering, and casting by the
waste wax process. These improved
methods of metal working spread
northwards through the Isthmus of
Panama to Costa Rica and southwards
to the northern part of the inter-
Andean valley and the coastal pro¬
vinces of Ecuador and Peru. On the
Peruvian seaboard, tumbaga appears
in the Early Chimu period (2,823 ±500
years ago) autogenous welding and
soldering in the Middle Chimu period,
and the special metal colouring pro¬
cess in the Late Chimu period
(1,838±190 years ago).
The Incas did not master the prin¬
ciples of tumbaga working until after
their conquest of the coastal regions,
which, according to Philip Ainsworth
Means, took place in the first half of
the fourteenth century in the south
and in the second half of the fifteenth
century in the north.
Silver working was developed, in
the main, on the Peruvian seaboard,
where it first appeared in the Para¬
cas period (2,257 ±200 years ago).
Thence it was introduced into the
high mountain regions, and reached
Ecuador during the Inca conquest.
The use of bronze was certainly
discovered in the high mountain re¬
gions of Peru and Bolivia. The alloy
of copper and tin was unknown on
the Peruvian coast until the Late
Chimu period. There is no doubt
that it was' chiefly due to the Incas
that the use of bronze spread through
all the provinces in their Empire, and
with it spread the knowledge of
metallurgy acquired from the Peru¬
vian coastal population (the use of
tumbaga, derived from Colombia, and
the use of silver, developed locally).
The Inca Empire, as it existed at the
time of the discovery of the Americas,
was thus a clearly defined metallur¬
gical region, in which the contribu¬
tions of Colombia, the high mountain
regions of Peru and Bolivia, and the
Peruvian seaboard were combined.
The use of lead was introduced into
Peruvian metallurgy at a very late
stage, in Inca times, but
we do not know whether
it first appeared on the
the coast or in the moun-

tain area. It is even possible that it
was first used in Mexico and then
spread to Peru, by way of the sea
communications between these two
countries.
In time, the expanding sphere of
influence of the Colombian peoples
overlapped with that of the Incas, so
that in certain areas the two combin¬
ed; in this way mixed industries,
showing some of the characteristics
found in both the zones already des¬
cribed, grew up in Ecuador and on
the coast of Peru. While bronze,
silver and its alloys, and lead were
entirely unknown in Colombia, and
while the craftsmen in the high
mountain areas of Peru and Bolivia
were unfamiliar with tumbaga and
the characteristic techniques associat¬
ed -with that alloy, all these metals
and alloys were used in Ecuador and.
on the Peruvian seaboard.
Once this is established, a compari¬
son of the metallurgy of the Peruvian
coast and that of Mexico reveals
extraordinary similarities, not to say
complete identity, between them. It
is clear, moreover, that at the time of
the discovery metals were still not
employed on a large scale in Mexico,
and we know that their use was a
recent innovation. At Monte Alban,
metals do not appear until about the
eleventh century, and then only in
small quantities. On the other hand,
despite the lack of roots in the past,

comparatively new and by no means
widespread, it shows a remarkable
perfection and variety in technique,
for which there is no evidence of
gradual local development, strongly
suggests that the metal working in¬
dustry was introduced into Mexico as
a fully developed craft equipped with
all the necessary technical resources,
and that it came from the Peruvian
coast. We now have proof that there
was trade by sea between Peru and
Central America in pre-Columbian
times. The craft used were balsas or
rafts, of which the old writers have
left us descriptions and drawings.
As a last note in this brief sketch
of pre-Columbian metal work, it may
be mentioned that platinum nuggets
were used in a limited area the
northern coastal strip of Ecuador and
the adjacent coastal regions of Co¬
lombia. There is evidence that the
Indians of Esmeraldas could form a
kind of homogeneous mixture of gold
and platinum, although, with the
techniques they used, neither it nor
pure platinum could be melted down.
It is impossible, in such a short
article, to describe all the techniques
used by the Indian craftsmen melt¬
ing down and casting, the metal
colouring process, plating, welding,
wire-drawing, embossing and repoussé
(chasing and work in relief done from
the underside of metal) etc. The
wealth of technical skills they com¬
manded is yet further evidence of the
fertile imagination of the pre-Colum¬
bian Indian, for although R. Heine-
Geldern has attempted to show that
American metallurgy is derived from
that of South Asia, I still believe that
the industry was indigenous and that
no outside influences affected its
development.

Knowledge blocked at the frontier
VIOLINS TAXED BY THE KILOGRAM
ART RATED AS 'VEGETABLE FIBRE'
Copyright Roger Viollet
by Philip L. Soljak
News item : Albert Burri, the controversial Italian artist,
became even more controversial. When a U.S. customs in¬
spector examined one of his works a collage of canvas and
other fabrics sewn and stuck together and stretched on a
frame he accepted the buyer's evaluation of $ 450, but balked
at calling it a work of art, which left it free of tax. Under
customs law he ruled it a "manufacture of vegetable fibres",
which carries a 20 per cent tax. The proud owners, Mr. and
Mrs. Donald Peters of New York, paid the 590 fee and
promptly filed an appeal. "It isn't a matter of the money",
explained Mrs. Peters firmly, "it's those archaic laws. They've
got to be changed some time and this is the only way to do
it." ("Newsweek", New York),
The world press frequently reports similar incidents showing
how complex and illogical trade restrictions bar the in¬
ternational flow of works of art, books, films and other
sources of knowledge.
At one busy North American port, it took an art dealer
many hours to convince customs officials that three posters
by the French painter, Henri Matisse, were "art" and not
subject to import duty. The officials claimed that the posters
were "packing material" and therefore taxable.
At another port, a piece of abstract sculpture, done in brass
by the Rumanian artist Brancusi, was classified as "block
matter" and duty was charged for industrial metal.
In Europe, the French producer of scientific films, Jean
Painlevé, became so embroiled in customs formalities while
travelling to an international conference that he left his films
in disgust at the frontier and gave his lecture at the conference
without them. Across the English Channel, Sir Stanley Unwin,
as president of the International Publishers Association, pro¬
tested that books were being taxed abroad by the kilo, like
bags of potatoes, instead of being treated as "the noblest of
man's works."
Unesco, which is permanently committed to "promote the
free flow of ideas by word and image", is waging an extensive
campaign to abolish trade restrictions on educational, scientific
and cultural materials. Every week it receives protests from
people in various countries who find it expensive, difficult or
even impossible to obtain these articles from abroad, or send
them to other lands because of the restrictions now in force.

exorbitant." A bookseller who had ordered books from
another country complained that "although the books cost
the equivalent of only 40 cents each, the export licence per
copy is $2.00 just five times the price of the book !" A
teacher enquired whether she could obtain wall charts for
her school without paying duty. "We have great difficulty in
importing visual aids", she added "and our customs officials
don't seem to know if wall charts should be taxed or not."
A common problem is that even when exemption is granted
under a country's tariff laws, it may not be adequately applied
in practice. Protests made to Unesco on these and other
grounds are listed on page 29.
The taxation of knowledge goes back for centuries and has
often been associated with "protection" or "privilege". In the
early days of printing, rulers of States granted certain printer-
booksellers the monopoly to print or publish. Others who
produced books were fined, imprisoned or executed and their
books destroyed.
In 17th century England, these restrictions evoked the
celebrated attack by John Milton in his Areopagitica : "Truth
and understanding", Milton declared "are not such wares as
to be monopolized and traded in by tickets, and statutes and
standards. We must not think to make a staple commodity
of all the knowledge in the land, to mark and license it like
our broadcloth, and our wool packs." Milton's appeal was
later re-echoed by Voltaire and also by Benjamin Franklin.
With the development of the popular press during the 18th
century, the licensing system was replaced or strengthened
by heavy taxes on publications. Designed to stifle political
criticism, these taxes curbed the circulation of the cheaper
newspapers and pamphlets which were read by the common
people. Many liberal thinkers, including John Wilkes in
England and Mirabeau in France, opposed these restrictions.
In the 19th century, the battle was renewed by William
Cobbett and Charles Dickens in England, and by Victor Hugo
and Félécité de Lamennais in France. Gradually, throughout
western Europe, the hated "newspaper taxes" were swept
away. There was also a move to free the exchange of ideas
between countries, and a number of governments reduced
import duties on books, printed music, maps and paintings.
The first World War brought this liberal, free trade period
to an end. Many countries increased their tariff and licensing
restrictions and educational articles were taxed indiscriminately
with "ships and shoes and sealing-wax" and other products.
The economic depression of the 1930's and the second World
War brought more rigid tariff, quota and exchange controls.
Frequently the object of these restrictions was to "protect"
a local publishing or equipment industry from foreign
competition. In most cases, however, the cost of collecting
the taxes exceeded the revenue obtained. Their actual result
was to "protect" the minds of people from the ideas and
attainments of their neighbours in other lands.
Following its establishment in 1946, unesco launched a
26
campaign to end these restrictions, and before long was receiv¬
ing the support of a growing number of countries. Its first
action was to draft an international agreement which, as
described later, exempts a wide range of educational, scien¬
tific and cultural materials from import duties. At the same
time, unesco made a world-wide survey of tariff and trade
regulations affecting the international flow of information
materials. This report, published as a manual entitled "Trade
Barriers to Knowledge", is designed to help publishers, libra¬
rians, educators, scientists, film exhibitors and others obtain
these articles from abroad, or send them to other countries.
Trade Barriers brings many startling facts to light. The
current edition (1) shows, for example, that of 92 major
countries throughout the world, eleven (12 per cent) levy
import duties on books, newspapers and magazines; 28 (30 per
cent) charge duties on paintings and sculpture; and 51 (56 per
cent) similarly tax scientific instruments. Newsprint, sound
recordings and radio sets are even more widely taxed. Duties
are imposed on newsprint by 59 (64 per cent) of the coun¬
tries; on recordings, by 62 (68 per cent) ; and on radio sets
by 91 (88 per cent). The most widespread obstacle, however,

is the restriction of imports through exchange controls and
licensing; 64 countries (over 70 per cent) limit trade in educa¬
tional materials in this way.
The restrictions themselves are complex, onerous and at
times illogical. Following are some examples, listed accord¬
ing to the main groups of materials with which "Trade
Barriers" deals.
Books and other publications. Denmark charges a duty
of $0.09 a kilogram on children's books in Danish, but
exempts books in other languages. Ethiopia levies a 9 per
cent duty on all books. Martinique charges a 12 per cent
"sea" duty on books bound in leather, but exempts others.
Guatemala exempts most publications from duty but on the
other hand levies a consular fee, an import tax, a toll tax and
a consignment tax together representing 20 per cent of the
value. India, Pakistan and Thailand exempt current news¬
papers, but impose duties on old ones. Indonesia levies a
100 per cent import charge on newspapers and tourist posters,
and 33 per cent on manuscripts.
In Ireland, religious books pay a 30 per cent duty, but
other books are free. Italy charges a 13 per cent duty on
books bound in leather and 18 per cent on illustrated volumes.
Luxembourg and the Netherlands impose a 20 per cent duty
on children's picture books and the Netherlands also charges
15 per cent on illustrated magazines. In Norway, children's
picture books pay a duty of $0.34 a kg. if the pictures are in
one colour, and a duty of $1.12 if the pictures are in two or
more colours as also do coloured tourist posters.
On books, newspapers and magazines, Panama levies an 8
per cent consular fee, plus a tax of $0.02 per package, and
stamp duty. Paraguay charges a similar consular fee on
publications. The USA levies a 7 1/2 per cent duty on
children's books and a 5 per cent duty on books in English.
This latter duty was established over 50 years ago to "protect"
an infant publishing industry which has now become one of
the largest in the world. Italy, Mexico, Norway and Portugal
also tax imported books in their national languages.
Works of art. In Australia, an Australian artist who has
lived abroad over 7 years pays a $5 duty if he returns with his
own painting. On non-Australian paintings the duty is bet¬
ween $5 and $6, and on statues between 12 and 32 per cent.
Austria and Czechoslovakia levy varying duties on stone
statues weighing over 5 kg., Angola charges a 32 per cent duty
on paintings and 27 per cent on sculpture. India's duties on
works of art are 25 per cent, Iran's 50 per cent, Iraq's 33 per
cent, Jordan's 30 per cent, New Zealand's 45 per cent and
the Sudan's 25 per cent.
Burma charges 25 per cent and Pakistan 60 per cent on
works of art, unless imported for public exhibit. Canada's
and Portugal's duties on foreign works of art range from 15
to 30 per cent. China (Formosa) levies a flat 40 per cent,
Ecuador 75 per cent, Morocco 12 per cent and Costa Rica
10 per cent. Czechoslovakia and Denmark exempt canvases,
but charge a separate duty on the frames. Indonesia levies a
30 per cent duty on works of art, plus a "luxury" import
charge of 300 per cent. Ireland charges 100 per cent on
statues in stone, and 75 per cent on those in plaster of Paris.
Japan levies a 50 per cent duty on ivory statues, and Liberia
charges 25 per cent on wooden ones.
Norway imposes a duty of $0.28 per kg. on pictures in
wooden frames. Panama charges 15 per cent on paintings,
and Paraguay 48 per cent, plus consular and other fees.
Peru's duty on paintings is $1.00 a kg. plus 14 per cent, and
Venezuela's $0.30 a kg. plus 15 per cent. Venezuela also
has a charge of $0.60 a kg. on metal statues.
Educational films and newsreels. Many countries fail to
grant any concessions to these films. Angola levies a general
import duty of 30 per cent; Austria, $32.16 per 100 kg.; the
Belgian Congo, 25 per cent; Bulgaria, $160 per 100 kg.;
Burma, $0.03 a foot; China (Formosa), 80 per cent; Czecho¬
slovakia, $139 per 100 kg.; Denmark, $4.33 per kg.; the
Dominican Republic, 15 per cent; Ethiopia, $0.30 per 100
metres plus 9 per cent; Guadeloupe and Martinique,
cent; French West Africa, 20 per cent.

30 per cent; Syria, $14 a kg.; French Togoland, 10 per cent;
the USSR, 100 per cent; Venezuela, $0.78 a kg.
Educational recordings. Few countries make any attempt
to discriminate between educational and "entertainment"
sound recordings, and only Hong Kong, Mexico, Singapore
and South Africa grant complete exemption. Countries
levying the highest general rates are Angola, 35 per cent;
Austria, $80 per 100 kg.; Bulgaria, $48 per 100 kg.; Burma,
40 per cent; China (Formosa), 100 per cent; Costa Rica, $0.53

Ireland, $0.11 a record; Mexico, $0.95 a kg.; Portugal, $3.32
a kg.; Saudi Arabia, 35 per cent; USSR, $12.50 a kg.
Music. Twenty countries impose duties on printed music,
and over 90 on musical instruments. On music, French West
Africa and the USA charge 5 per cent, Panama 8 per cent,
Ethiopia 9 per cent, Canada and Costa Rica 10 per cent,
French Equatorial Africa and Guadeloupe 12 per cent, French
Cameroons and Paraguay 20 per cent, Indonesia 33 per cent.

$0.72 plus 8 per cent import tax; Iran, $1.00; Peru, $0.06
plus 14 per cent tax; Venezuela, $0.06. South Africa charges
10 per cent on manuscripts.
Duties on instruments are levied variously by weight, value
or type of article concerned. For example, Bulgaria charges
$16 a kg. for hurdy-gurdies, but double that for harps;
Mexico's stiftest duty is on mouth organs and street organs
($3 a kg.); Spain charges $1 a kg. on hurdy-gurdies and a
general duty of $300 or more on pianos. The USA's duty
on violins is 40 per cent, Finland's $1.47 a kg., and Guate¬
mala's $1.00 a kg. Norway charges $0.84 on a zither, Swit¬
zerland $0.16 a kg. on ocarinas and Sweden $0.68 a kg. on
accordions. Australia levies a general duty of I

Scientific instruments are essential to social progress and,
in the case of the less developed countries, are needed parti¬

Angola charges 3-28 per cent; Australia 17 per cent; Burma,

ledge of the world around us. However, although good quali¬
ty maps and charts are produced by relatively few countries,
some 30 countries levy duties on those from abroad.
Australia charges 17 per cent; Ethiopia 9 per cent; French
Togoland and French West Africa 20 per cent; French Guiana

Materials for the handicapped. It is hard to believe that
a country would charge duties on articles needed by the blind,
the partially sighted and the deaf. Yet over 50 countries tax
one or more of these groups of materials.
Duties on all three groups are levied by French Equatorial
Africa, French West Africa, German Federal Republic, Indo¬
nesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Lebanon, Panama, Sudan, and French
Togoland. On braille writers, duties are charged by Angola,
Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Dominican Repub¬
lic, Ecuador, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Mozambique, Portugal
and Spanish Morocco. Hearing aids are taxed by Algeria.

Highlighting this maze of restrictions on the flow of know¬
ledge, "Trade Barriers" has evoked widespread interest in the
world press. Sir Stanley Unwin, who has particularly
championed the cause of books over many years, wrote of
the handbook: "It is a sad reflection upon the age in which
we live that it should require a large and closely set volume
merely to summarize all the many artificial barriers which
obstruct the free flow of information from one country to
another... Let us hope that the energy to sweep away these
'Trade Barriers to Knowledge' will not be lacking."
Governments have, in fact, shown an increasing willingness
to support unesco's efforts to this end. In 1949, the 34 nations
which are the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) helped unesco to draft an
international convention (The Agreement on the Importation
of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials).
Countries joining this agreement grant duty-free exemption
to books, newspapers, periodicals, music scores, works of art,
maps and charts. Also exempt are newsreels, educational
films, recordings, models, scientific instruments and articles
for the blind if for approved institutions or organizations.
In addition, internal taxes on imported articles may not
exceed those charged on domestic products, and import fees

must be limited in amount to the cost of the services rendered.
Under another provision, governments agree to grant import
licences and foreign exchange for books and other publications
needed by public libraries. They also undertake to simplify
their import procedures, to ease the customs clearance of
educational, scientific and cultural materials, and continue
their efforts to promote the free flow of these articles.
The unesco agreement entered into force in May 1952
and is now being applied by 22 countries, embracing over
450 million people. These countries are Belgium, Cambodia,
Ceylon, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, France, Greece, Haiti, Israel,
Laos, Monaco, Pakistan, the Philippines, El Salvador, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom, Viet-Nam
and Yugoslavia. The United Kingdom has also extended the
convention to almost all of its overseas territories, so that mil¬
lions of British subjects abroad are now sharing the benefits
of the agreement equally with those at home. Twelve
countries have signed but not yet ratified it (1).
Urging the United States to join the Agreement, the "New
York Times" commented: "It is hardly likely that placing on
the free list any such items on which tariffs are now collected
would result in dire consequences for this country... This is
one field in which it might be easy to beat the protectionists.
In the first place, the United States is a book exporting
country, and in the second place the tariff we do impose on
books is low and has little economic significance anyway...
Approval of the pact on free importation of educational,
scientific or cultural materials would give a psychological
boost to the whole movement for freer cultural exchange
among the nations." These points might well be considered
by other countries which have not yet joined the agreement.
The convention has received support from the UN Economic
and Social Council and the Council of Europe, which have
urged governments to adhere to it. It has also been endorsed
The Unesco Courier
by over 20 international associations, including the World
Federation of United Nations Associations, the League of
Red Cross Societies, the International Publishers Association
and the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers
(F1EJ). Most of these associations have asked their national
member associations to urge the governments of their countries
to join the agreement. These appeals indicate that perhaps
the most effective way of reducing taxes on knowledge would
be to secure universal adoption of the unesco convention.
Meanwhile, unesco has sought directly to encourage inter¬
national negotiation for the reduction of tariffs on information
materials. Early in 1956 it requested the Contracting Parties
to the GATT that they consider removing duties on these
articles at their tariff negotiating conference in Geneva. In
response, the conference noted that the 26 participating
countries were urged to "eliminate or reduce barriers to the
free flow in international trade" in the items covered by the
unesco agreement.
The conference ended in May with 14 nations agreeing
to grant reductions. The U.S.A. is cutting tariffs on maps
and charts ; Chile and Sweden, on films ; Belgium, German
Federal Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, on
sound recordings ; German Federal Republic, Norway, Sweden
and the United Kingdom on radio receivers or parts ; Japan
on television receivers ; Sweden, the United Kingdom and the
U.S.A. on certain musical instruments ; Australia, Canada,
France, Italy, Sweden and the U.S.A. on various scientific
instruments ; Canada on newsprint ; and the United Kingdom
on printing paper. These concessions mark new gains in
Unesco's campaign to make articles of knowledge more fully
available 'to the world's peoples.
(1) Afghanistan, Bolivia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Iran, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand.
Here are typical examples of the
many appeals for help or advice
which Unesco has received from
people trying to obtain books, works of
art, films and other educational articles
from abroad.
Belgian teacher : Our schools have the
right to obtain books free of duty if they
import them directly. However, import
procedures are so onerous that few
schools can undertake this work. Most
schools therefore ask agents to do the
importing. But they then lose their right
of exemption, which apparently exists
only in theory.
This problem is solved, now that Bel¬
gium has joined the Unesco Agreement
on the Importation of Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Materials. The
Agreement grants duty-free entry to all
books, regardless of destination, as well
as to many other articles.
Indian importer of documentary films.
We have imported a film on agricultural
training which would be most useful in
an under-developed country like ours.
Although the film is purely instructional
and was made by another government
(United States of America), our authori¬
ties have refused to classify it as educa¬
tional. They have accordingly charged a
S. o. s
duty equivalent to $43.75, whereas the
film itself cost only $36.27 to rent.
When India joins the Unesco Agree¬
ment, films like this could be granted
duty-free entry without the formality of
classification. The importing organization
. would, however, need to obtain recogni¬
tion from the authorities as an approved
importer of educational films.
French museum director : I have just
paid duty on three sound recordings from
abroad and must now pay an even higher
tax on a fourth record, although it is
not new. Can I obtain tax exemption and
have these payments refunded ?
France has joined the Unesco Agree¬
ment, which exempts sound recordings
under certain conditions. If the records
were educational, scientific or cultural
and were consigned to the museum, the
authorities would probably agree to re¬
fund the sums paid.
United States publisher : We export
numerous technical books but often find
that booksellers abroad have trouble in
obtaining foreign currency to pay for the
books after they have arrived. The book¬
sellers fall behind in ' their payments to
us and we naturally hesitate to extend
them further credit. The ultimate losers
are schools and libraries, who are the
booksellers' largest customers.
A shortage of foreign exchange pre¬
vents many countries from making funds
readily available for the importation of
numerous articles, including books from
U.S.A. and other "hard currency"
countries. However, this obstacle may be
overcome through the Unesco Internatio¬
nal Coupon Scheme, which enables per¬
sons in "soft currency" countries to
obtain books from "hard currency"
ones. The scheme also applies to periodi¬
cals, educational films and scientific
equipment.
British educational foundation : Des¬
pite Unesco's help in making a film on
Shakespeare's theatre available to us, we
have run into an unexpected snag. The
film is being held by the customs until
we get an import licence, which will take
weeks to obtain. Since most of the
schools will then be closed for the holi¬
days, my only course is to return the
film to you.
The British Board of Trade points out
that although the United Kingdom
exempts educational films from duty
under the Unesco Agreement, importers
(or exhibitors) in many cases are requir¬
ed to obtain an import licence for the
necessary foreign currency. Application
for the licence should be made well in
advance, to avoid delay in delivery of
the film.

<![CDATA[
CRACO is a village in southern Italy.
It lies on a hilltop, somewhere
on the borders of Lucania and
Calabria, in a region rich in folk
traditions, which is still little known
even to most Italians.
Describing this part of Italy
beyond Eboli the novelist Carlo Levi
has said that it is like a series of
each with its own folklore
and ancient traditions. The description
is apt since in these mountain valleys
thunder, heavy rain began to fall and
we burst a tyre.
But the next day the "evil eye"
seemed to have been exorcised. The
sun was shining brightly and I set
off to visit the 234 children who are
attending school in the converted
barn of a former monastery. The
headmistress, a stout and friendly
woman, was anxious about the lack of
space in her school. "We get a sub¬
sidy from the Government and from

take many paths, often
walk miles to class. Upper

Goat attends all classes,
particularly dislikes arith¬
metic lessons, but serves
as free milk bar for Maria

cramped during lunch hour
that children often eat
their meal standing up.
(UNESCO)
Greek and Albanian are spoken- as
as Italian. Byzantine churches
adjoin cave dwellings, and Protestant
sects still subsist together with Jewish
communities and so-called "Tolstoy-
an" hermits.
Craco is a typical village of these
parts. I arrived there late one after¬
noon over a rough, winding road
fringed with olive trees which seemed
to be clinging to the bare hillsides.
A storm was threatening and my
driver remarked: "You have to beware
of the evil eye in this part of the
country/' As we drove into the village
we met a group of women dressed in
black; there was a sudden clap of
the Food and Agriculture Organiza¬
tion, to serve a hot meal at midday",
she explained. "But our improvised
dining hall is so cramped that the
children have to eat standing up."
It was quite a task, the headmis¬
tress told me, to persuade parents to
send their children to school instead
of putting them to work in the fields.
Of course, the 3,000 sheep, 60 cows
and 300 mules owned by the villagers
all need looking after. But thanks to
the skill and diplomacy of her eight
assistant-teachers, the headmistress
has gradually succeeded in winning
over the parents.
In one of the classrooms, I met
The Unesco Courier
eight-year-old Maria who comes to
school with her goat because there Is
no one to look after it at home. The
goat bleated pitifully during the
arithmetic class but at lunchtime it
provided a large bowl of fnilk for its
young mistress. There seemed to be
more boys than girls in the school,
probably because you must be able
to read to obtain a driver's licence for
a motor-bike or car. Unfortunately,
this obligation does not reduce the
number of accidents
on the roads. How¬
ever, it is not so much
because of motor-bikes
as through the Go¬
vernment's efforts that
illiteracy is practically
wiped out in Craco.
But in spite of the
changes wrought by
modern techniques, the
peasants of Calabria
and especially of Luca¬
nia remain very much
attached to their an¬
cient traditions. Side
by side with religious
ceremonies, they still
practise ancient rites
which seem to be the
heritage of a distant,
pre-Christian past. It
is a hard struggle to
eke out an existence on
these barren hillsides,
and their belief in the
power of magic is a
kind of defence against
the uncertainties o f
life. In the end they
almost confuse these
practices with religion.
They believe that on
occasions such as births
and weddings it is par¬
ticularly important to
protect their families
from evil influences.
Many of the school¬
children in Craco still
wear a tiny bag sus¬
pended on a chain round their necks
which contains the ashes of their
umbilical cord. And a nine-year-old
schoolboy, Giorgio, told me how, when
his little brother was born, his
parents made a show of putting the
baby into the oven so as to protect
him all his life from the dangers
of fire.
Similarly it is not unusual for young
people to ask their relations to stand
watch over their house on their wed¬
ding night in order to keep out the
monacello (little monk) a
mischievous goblin whom (Cont'd on

married life. To keep the "little
monk" from doing any harm, a
scythe is placed by the door with its
tip pointing upwards, or newspapers
are laid on the ground. Since the
monacello considers himself obliged to
count every single letter or symbol in
the paper, he will be kept busy for a
long time at least till morning.
Such practices, however, are fast
disappearing. Since the opening of
the school and the introduction of
books and newspapers in the village,
young people view these ancient super¬
stitions with increasing scepticism.
But they still retain their gift of
poetic expression. Tales are told on
winter evenings when the family
gathers round the hearth, and at
funerals long poetic laments are
improvised by the deceased's next-of-
kin and recited by all the mourners.
Schools can play an important part
in helping to improve living condi¬
tions in isolated villages such as
Craco. They are headquarters in the
figi.t against illiteracy and help to
banish out-dated ideas. They can
also help to build up a written record
of the tales and legends composed by
local poets and which form the basis
of a cultural heritage of colourful
and varied folklore and traditions.
NEW PATHS TO THE EAGLE'S NEST
Village of Craco looms against sky like mountain eagle's nest, its houses huddled together in
serried clump. Once practically cut off from new ideas from the outside world, Craco, like
hundreds of other small villages in Calabria and Lucania, has been waging campaign against illite¬
racy since I 947 with support of Italian Government and voluntary organizations. Unesco experts
have also aided these campaigns. Local doctors, engineers, veterinarians and parish priests have
come forward as volunteer teachers of reading and writing for adults. Since opening of new
schools illiteracy has been practically wiped out in many places. Parents now send children to
school (below) instead of putting them to work in the fields or to look after animals.

The Unesco Courier
From the Unesco Newsroom
31,ISSION TO BOMBAY: An inter¬
national Unesco mission of scientists and
engineers recently went to India to work
with the Indian Government in setting up
an institute of technology in Bombay. The
team, led by the Deputy Director of
Unesco's Department of Natural Sciences,
included six engineers from the Soviet
Union and a British aeronautical engineer.
Other Unesco experts joined it in New
Delhi. The mission which was sent to
India under the U. N. world programme of
technical assistance for economic and social
development, will help to draw up final
plans and determine equipment require¬
ments for the Western Higher Institute of
Technology, the second of four technologi¬
cal institutes being set up by the Govern¬
ment of India. Following this preliminary
work, Unesco will begin a long-term pro¬
gramme of aid to the new institute, sup¬
plying both professors and equipment.
H CENTRE OF CULTURE: The
Burmese Government is setting up a
national cultural centre in Rangoon
consisting of a library, museum and an
art gallery. Unesco is aiding in plan¬
ning and organizing the centre by con¬
tributing S2,500 for architects' fees, and
52,000 worth of equipment for the mu¬
seum and library. Unesco has also
offered four fellowships for Burmese
librarians and museum specialists to
study abroad.
ILSE YOUR MUSEUM: Forty-four
countries intend to take part in Unesco's
world-wide campaign next October to high¬
light the role of museums in community
life. The campaign aims to show how
important a part museums can play in
educating the public, just as libraries, news¬
papers, films and radio do in their respec¬
tive spheres. To help national, regional
and local authorities who plan to hold
special exhibitions, Unesco has just issued
a poster illustrating the development of
museums.
B MULTI-RACIAL UNIVERSITIES:
The opening of new African universities
"brings the principle of race equality to
the forefront in central Africa" states
a recent report of the U. N. General
Assembly's Committee on Information
from Non-Self-Governing Territories.
The growing list of universities in Afri¬
can non-self-governing territories could
prove an important ingredient in a
changing racial situation, it adds.
Among the 92 students last autumn at
the University of Leopoldville in the
Belgian Congo, which opened its cour¬
ses in 1954, 77 were Africans and 15
were Europeans. The report also quotes
a British statement that the new Rhode-
sia-Nyasaland University will be on a
multi-racial basis which it is hoped,
"will prove a potent influence in the
improvement of race relations in this
part of Africa within the concept of
partnership."
It RINGING ASIA INTO FOCUS :
Teachers and historians from 16 Western
countries and from Asia held a series of
meetings in Paris on May 2 to study how
the presentation of Asia in Western text¬
books and teaching materials can be im¬
proved. Basis of the discussions were reports
sent to Unesco by its National Commissions
in 18 Western countries where educators
have examined the place given to Asia in
their textbooks. Summarizing national re¬
ports, a discussion paper before the Com¬
mittee stated that the treatment of Asia was
in general "superficial, episodic, incomplete
and impersonal". (See ' "Asian History
Through Western Glasses," in The Unesco
Courier, March 1956; U.S.-May).
B HELLO OLD FELLOWS : Over
1,300 men and women who have follow¬
ed courses in other countries through
UNESCO fellowships and who are now
back at work in their own lands are
today linked in all parts of the world
through a Unesco Fellowship Bulletin.
When this was put out as a trial issue
at the end of 1955 Unesco fellows in 40
countries wrote back to say what they
were now doing. The second number
of the bulletin issued recently shows the
wide variety of fields in which these
men and women are using knowledge
gained abroad. It is now proposed to
form associations of Unesco fellows in
different countries.
O'LD JOBNEW LAND : Leather
workers, joiners, shop assistants and dairy
workers have been taking part in a long-
term workers exchange initiated last year
by Unesco to enable European workers to
visit other countries for from three to 12
months and to learn about the life there by
working among the people. The first
person to take part in the scheme, a 25-
year-old Swedish leather worker, has just
returned home after working for nine
months in a shoe factory at Leicester,
England. Other exchange workers have
come from Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Germany and Switzerland. The plan is
administered with the help of international
trade union and co-operative organizations
and travel expenses are paid by unesco.
B CYBERNETICS AND YOU : Scien¬
tists from many countries were present
at an International Congress on Cyber¬
netics which was held in Namur, Belgium,
from June 26 to 29, under the spon¬
sorship of the Belgian Ministry of Edu¬
cation and UNESCO. Today, the term
cybernetics means little to the average
person. One dictionary defines it as
"the comparative study of the human
nervous system and of complex elec¬
tronic calculating machines aimed at
increasing the understanding of how the
human brain functions" while another
describes it more briefly as "the theory
of control and communication in the
animal and the machine". This new
science, however, is radically transform¬
ing industry and is bound to affect all
sectors of human activity. At Namur,
scientists will consider its implications
in such varied scientific fields as the
mathematical theory of communications,
mechanical computation, biology, phy¬
siology, medicine, psychology and social
IVcOMAD SCHOOLS : Seventy-six
nomad schools were set up in southern Iran
during 1954-55 to provide classes for
children of wandering tribes. During the
present year these schools will be increased
by 41. More than 500 of these schools,
organized by the Iranian Higher Council
for Education, are now operating through¬
out Iran.
B 'TALKING BOOKS' : Libraries from
which blind people can borrow "talking
books" the texts of literary works
recorded on magnetic tape or discs are
a well-established institution in the
United States. Their development in
Europe, where they are at present in the
experimental stage, can now be expected
following a recent meeting of represen¬
tatives from 15 countries to discuss a
European edition of "talking libraries" .
ItIRITISH BOOK BOOM : A record
annual total of 19,962 titles published was
reached by publishers in the United King¬
dom during 1955. Of these titles an
increase of 774 over the previous year
5,770 were reprints or new editions. As
in 1954, the four largest classes were fic¬
tion, children's books, educational works
and books on religion.
B ONE GOOD TURN : A Dutch orga¬
nization "to promote international soli¬
darity by giving technical, economic
and financial assistance" to less-devel¬
oped countries was recently set up in
Amsterdam. In providing technical as¬
sistance it will co-operate with the U.N.
and Specialized Agencies, using funds
raised through employers' associations,
workers' unions, youth movements, re¬
ligious groups and other organizations.
The new organization was founded, in
part, as a response to the aid which
many countries gave to Netherlands
when disastrous floods devastated part
of the country in February, 1953.

L etters to the Editor
Sir,
The January issue (N° 11, 1955, Euro¬
pean edition) of The Unesco Courier on
the changing role of women is most
excellent, as your issues uniformly are.
There is, however, one aspect of woman's
accomplishment which is rarely noted.
I refer to the opportunities afforded and
realized in the Church. Notable jobs are
being done by nuns as administrators of
widespread religious orders, as deans and
presidents of colleges, as heads of hospitals
and orphanages etc. Much of this activity
is centuries old. Some is new, like the
nun doctors for the medical missions.
Francis Burke
Miifawnn, New Jersey,
U.S.A.
Sir,
The article by Prof. Ashley Montagu of
issue N° 11, 1955 (U.S.-January 1956) of
The Unesco Courier was rather sensation¬
al. I have been waiting for comments by
the scientists but so far I have seen none.
However, it was interesting to read the
newspaper and magazine extracts in the
March issue (U.S.-May). I have not
since I was a little boy believed in the
general inferiority of a woman. I find
it as difficult to believe in her general
superiority. I am no scientist, but a good
common sense view seems to be that the
sexes are rather equal as to quality.
Is Prof. Montagu recording a scientific
fact? If so, we shall have to accept it.
If not, it seems to me that René Leyraz
is right when writing (in the Courrier, Ge¬
neva):. "Masculine superiority and femi¬
nine superiority are two equally dangerous
myths." While waiting for the scientists'
comments to the statements of Prof. Mon¬
tagu, I quote from Murphy and Newcomb
Experimental Social Psychology. "From
such material as we have, we can therefore
say that as a rule sex differences in in¬
telligence are not found." Otto Klineberg
seems to take the same position, when
talking of intelligence as most other
traits as well.
I often wonder: Of what use are those
"scientific" speculations of the superiority
of the one sex (or race) as compared with
the other? No "inferiority" or "superiori¬
ty" follows sex or colour of skin. Wouldn't
that assumption be a more useful starting-
point? Isn't the attempt to prove something
else a waste of time and powers?
Johan Schiong
Bergen, Norway.
Sir,
In your March (U.S.-May 1956) issue of
The Unesco Courier there is a serious
error in the answer to one of the questions
in the Asia Quiz, namely that the inhabi¬
tants of Ceylon are called Sinhalese. The
inhabitants of Ceylon are called Ceylonese
and not Sinhalese. The Ceylonese Commu¬
nity consists of Sinhalese, Ceylon Tamils,
Indian Tamils, Muslims, Malays, Burghers
and Europeans. Of these the Sinhalese
form the majority community in the island.
According to available population statistics,
Sinhalese form 69.3 percent of the total
population. The Ceylon Tamils are second,
forming 11.2 percent of the total popula¬
tion. The Muslims total 503,770, Malays
28,736, Burghers 43,916, Europeans 5,418.
The total population of Ceylon is 8.1
million. I am aware that in most publica¬
tions the mistake of calling the inhabitants
of Ceylon Sinhalese still exists though some
have rectified it in recent years.

Editor's note: Our reader is right.
The people of Ceylon are commonly
called Sinhalese (or Cingalese, etc.) and
though most dictionaries give these
names, the official and correct term is
Ceylonese. The Burghers referred to
are the descendants of the original
Portuguese and Dutch settlers in
Ceylon.
Sir,
After I received The Unesco Courier
(March 1956; U.S.-May), first I tried the
"Asia Quiz" and I got 13 questions right
out of 47, but now I have read all the
issue and I can answer almost all the
questions.

Sir,
I have just received and read with great
interest the issue of The Unesco Courier
devoted to the learning of history by our
children (March, 1956-U.S. May). Con¬
gratulations to Unesco on producing a
study which should undoubtedly attract the
attention of all teachers and persons in¬
terested in Education.
In the article "Asia Quiz" it is said that
the Nobel Prize has been awarded to Asian
Scientists or Thinkers three times only. To
the best of my knowledge I mention that
Jagadis Chandra Bose (India) has also been
awarded a Nobel Prize for his scientific
research. He proved that the plant has
also life and feeling like man.
B.P. Desai

Editor's note: Sir Jagadis Chandra (or
Chunder) Bose (1858-1937) was one of
India's great geniuses of science. For
his important contributions to plant
physiology and physics he was
knighted in 1917 and elected Fellow
of the Royal Society in 1920. But he
was never awarded the Nobel Prize.
His work in animal and particularly
plant physiology was much in advance
of his time. He introduced new
experimental methods and invented
many delicate and sensitive instruments,
such as the crescograph for recording
plant growth, magnifying a tiny move¬
ment as much as 10 million times.
He devised an apparatus which rang
a bell with every bubble of oxygen
produced by a plant, and others for
demonstrating the effects of air, food,
drugs, rest, etc., on plants. He proved
there was a complete parallelism
between the responses of plant and
animal tissues. During tours of Eur¬
ope in the 1920's and '30'i he
astounded scientists by his original
approach and great technical genius.
Sir,
I have just read the March 1956 (U.S.¬
May) issue of The Unesco Courier and in
particular the article "How Biased Are Our
History Textbooks?" by Herbert Abraham.
Congratulations on an excellent practical
piece of work to aid understanding and in¬
ternational co-operation through the in¬
termediary of history teachers.
Widely distributed in Eastern and
Western countries, this issue will undoubt¬
edly have a beneficial influence on the
basic conception of history teaching pro¬
grammes and on the writing of textbooks.
I hope it will also pursuade "National"
Ministries of Education to give a greater
place to international history in school pro¬
grammes.

The activities of the primitive medicine man are brushed away by the average
person as "hocus-pocus". In reality they are not. In the course of rituals of reli¬
gion and magic, whether they take place in the African bush, the South American
forest, or among the Navaho of arid Arizona, magic potions are imbibed (as in photo
above of Tarupi Indians in the Amazon), which very often contain highly effective
drugs; magic manipulations and purification rites are performed (Tarupi Indians
below) which correspond largely to our own physiotherapy. (See story on page 4)
