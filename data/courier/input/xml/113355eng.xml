It isn’t easy to be young in Algeria, a

More and more Algerians live in the street,

Dalila the militant
Th i r t y - t w o - y e a r-old Dalila
Taleb already has a long
career of political activism
behind her. The October 1988
riots in A l g i e r s, in which more
than 500 young people died,
filled her with passion to
defend her country’s youth,
tragically left to fend for itself.
In 1993, with a group of
f r i e n d s, she founded the Yo u t h
Action Movement (RAJ) which
was an overnight success.
D a l i l a , its president, q u i c k l y
became one the most popular
figures among the youth in
the poorer sections of the
c a p i t a l . The RAJ’s members
range from girls wearing the
veil to pop music fans, f r o m
Islamist supporters to moder-
n i z e r s. And the movement
w o r k s, despite the constraints
and problems confronting
voluntary organizations in
A l g e r i a . Without losing touch
with the grassroots, D a l i l a
went into politics and in the
1997 parliamentary elections
became an opposition FFS
( Front of Socialist Groups)
member of the National Pe o-
p l e ’s Assembly representing
her home town of Bejaia. I n
the A s s e m b l y, where she is a
member of the youth, s p o r t s
and voluntary work commis-
s i o n , she has made a name for
herself as an orator who
speaks out against all kinds of
violence and arbitrary beha-
viour– whoever its perpetra-
tors may be. ■

from insecuri t y. M a ny now cannot
e ven study–hundreds of schools have
closed in the wo rst affected areas such
as Blida, Medea and Chlef. Social vio-
lence is also soari n g . The gove rn m e n t
is in many ways ineffective and daily
life has become so difficult that parents
can no longer minister to their chil-
d r e n ’s needs. Some 300,000 yo u n g
people come onto the job market eve ry
year in a country where there are
already more than two million unem-
p l oye d . The middle class is shri n k i n g,
the poor are getting poorer and the
rich are getting ri c h e r. The streets of
the capital teem with young children
selling newspapers or cleaning car win-
d ows–scenes which
would have been
i n c o n c e i vable a few
ye a rs ago.
If they can’t live
n o rmal live s , yo u n g
A l g e rians can at least
dream about easing
their fru s t r at i o n s
through freedom of
e x p r e s s i o n . The cur-
few has been lifted in
A l gi e rs , but the state of emergency is
still in force and public gat h e rings are
b a n n e d . Tickets for the few concert s
staged these days are expensive . A
black-market ticket costs 800 dinars *
when the minimum wage is about
5,000 dinars , and only about one
young person in twenty can afford to
g o. Cinemas are closing. Film clubs
h ave disappeared. Young people don’t
bother with youth and cultural centres
a ny more because they are suspicious
of anything to do with the authori t i e s
and because the courses on offer cost
m o n e y. The gove rnment pleads secu-
rity reasons for restricting the activities
of civil society. But preventing yo u n g
people from expressing themselves pea-
cefully can only push them towa r d s
violent forms of self-expression or eve n
to extremism.
They dream of escaping a “sick life”
which weighs even more heavily on
girls than boy s. In big tow n s , c o e d u c a-
tion has surv i ved the recent ye a rs of
troubles fairly we l l . But eve rything is
harder for gi r l s. I t ’s hard for them to
go out in an evening with boy s , u n l e s s
they belong to a ve ry restricted social
c i r c l e . As a result of a profoundly sexist
e d u c ation system, i t ’s hard for them to
l e a rn anything at
youth centres except
sewing or embroi-
d e ry, whereas boy s
can study computer
s c i e n c e . And it’s hard
to escape the conser-
vatism of most A l g e-
rian fa m i l i e s , w h o
keep a tight rein on
the lives of their
d a u g h t e rs.
Young people dream of peace.T h e y
feel alienated by the violence that
confronts them. Talk to them about
peace and their enthusiasm is imme-
d i ately aroused. Young musicians have
w ritten some amazing songs about
p e a c e . O t h e rs express themselve s
through theatre or painting. In the
Youth Action Move m e n t , by teaching
them to help one another and show
s o l i d a ri t y, we have managed to get tee-
n a g e rs to work together, to ove r c o m e
their differences and break down the

tions have built between boys and gi r l s.
All that needs to be done is to bri n g
them together and invo l ve them in a
common project. For many yo u n g
people feel fru s t r ated that there is
nothing they can do to bring about
c h a n g e .
They dream of peace, but like the
rest of the population they are caught
b e t ween the violence of Islamist extre-
mists and that of the gove rn m e n t . I n
A l g e ri a ,s a d l y, difference is synony m o u s
with intolerance. H atred between the

at things, b e t ween regi o n s , b e t we e n

d i ve rsity into an endless source of
c o n fli c t .A l g e rians have barely had time
to develop democratic practices.
Without jobs, without being able to
e nvisage a better life and without hope,
young people lounge idly in the
s t r e e t s – “ h u g ging the wa l l s ,” as A l g e-
rians put it, nicknaming them “ h i t t i s t s ”
(from the Arabic word h i t, m e a n i n g
“ wa l l ” ) . The young dream, but their
dreams turn into nightmares because
their elders either do not know how or
do not want to talk to them. ■

E D I TO R I A L
September 1998 -The UNESCO Courier 9
It is too often forgotten that the Unive rsal Declaration of Human Rights is not only
c o n c e rned with civil and political rights but also with what are known as economic
and social ri g h t s. In the preamble to the Declarat i o n , it is stipulated that “ F r e e d o m
from fear and wa n t ” is “the highest aspiration of the common people.” It is no coin-
cidence that the Declaration dates from the period when the foundations of the Uni-
ted Nations system were laid and the Marshall Plan was launched. At that time it wa s
possible to dream; pain and precarity were conducive to utopia; it was a time when a
common horizon could be redraw n .
To d ay, the civilization and culture of which we are so proud will break dow n
unless we can stabilize and halt population gr ow t h , n a rr ow the gap between rich and
p o o r , and create decent living conditions–educat i o n , public health, wo r k , h o u s i n g – f o r
the billions of people who share this beautiful planet.
UNESCO believes that in order to successfully take up the challenge of pove rt y,
four basic principles must be taken into account.
- Development of endogenous capacities. This means giving each country, e a c h
people and each person the capacity to decide for themselve s , to make their ow n
c h o i c e s , to exploit on their own account the natural resources around them. T h i s
i m p e r at i ve has a name: c o - o p e r at i o n . It is something quite different from technical and
other forms of assistance, such as they have been implemented hithert o.
- Improvement of the quality of life in rural areas. I f, in peacetime, we manage to
mobilize all resources, including those of the armed forces, then this quality of life will
reach the point at which immigr at i o n , p ri m a rily to the pove rty belts around the big
cities and then towards foreign countri e s , will disap-
pear or at least diminish.
- Citizenship and part i c i p at i o n , especially at the
local leve l . This is where democracy is cemented and
where the guidelines traced by gove rnments should be
implemented by all citizens. It is here too that
UNESCO envisages an extraordinary development of
new jobs, new ways of taking part in working life, e s p e-
cially in environmental management.
- Continuing and out-of-school educat i o n . This is
i m p o rtant for its own sake, of cours e , but also for the
global nexus of inform ation and communication that is
indispensable in today ’s wo r l d . No one should be able
to say that the train has left without them. E ve ryone must have an opport u n i t y, in the
c o u rse of their live s , to climb back onto the train of educat i o n , d i g n i t y, training and
d e m o c r a cy. This possibility is one of the basic principles of the culture of peace.
But if the rich countries have been incapable of devoting 0.7 per cent of their
GNP to the development of the most disadvantaged countri e s , h ow can we hope to
b ring to fruition the common enterp rise known as sustainable development? How
can this be done when, until not so long ago, d e velopment was regarded as little more
than economic gr ow t h , when the idea prevailed that a country would become modern
and its people would have a better life if it increased its industrial output or its rate of
e l e c t ricity consumption? The inevitable corollary of that mistake is to impose models
of development from the outside on the peoples who must apply them, taking no
account of their specific histori c a l , cultural or psychological backgr o u n d . The most
i m m e d i ate consequence of this approach is the gigantic moral and mat e rial cost paid
by many countries subjected to measures of macro-economic adjustment. Pa r a d ox i-
c a l l y, this sometimes leads to the bolstering of military regi m e s , the weakening of
civil society and the retreat of democracy because the problems which it causes extend
the repressive apparatus of the stat e .
Of course the development process includes a quantitat i ve and economic compo-
n e n t . B u t , as the Spanish philosopher Julián Marías once said, “nothing that is human
is purely quantitat i ve ” . P r o gress does not consist of the accumulation of objects,
nuclear missiles, automobiles or computers. It is indissociable from morality, from a
t e l e o l o gical dimension of existence. When we ask questions about progr e s s , the firs t
question is not “ h ow much or how many ? ” but “for whom?” ■
Progress for whom?
Federico Mayor
If the rich countries have been incapable of
devoting 0.7 per cent of their GNP to the
development of the most disadvantaged
countries, how can we hope to bring to
fruition the common enterprise known as
sustainable development?

10 The UNESCO Courier - September 1998
Feeding the world is one of the big
challenges of the next century.
Pa r a d ox i c a l l y, whereas the planet’s
fa rm e rs actually produce more food than
world population needs, about 800 mil-
lion people are chronically undern o u ri-
shed and two billion suffer from malnu-
t ri t i o n , nearly all of them in the poor
c o u n t ries of the South.
The number of mouths to feed is
expected to increase by almost 100 mil-
lion annually in the next thirty ye a rs. A
worldwide short fall in production is not
yet the main cause of hunger, but output
will have to be stepped up in the first half
of the next century.
The area of cropland will cert a i n l y
h ave to be expanded, but a limit will
quickly be reached. B i o d i ve rsity is
already under threat ; d e f o r e s t ation causes
erosion and impove rishes soil, i rri g at i o n
leads to salinization and water resources
are shri n k i n g . To d ay fa rm e rs are also
required to respect the environment and
the health of consumers. In the 1960s,
the “ green revo l u t i o n ” was about maxi-
mizing production by using massive
quantities of fert i l i z e rs , pesticides and
other inputs. The downside of this race 
to boost output was that it generat e d
p o l l u t i o n .
M a s s i ve inputs did not eliminate crop
l o s s e s , which are still considerable, ru n-
ning in the early 1990s to 42 per cent of
all the wheat , rice and maize harve s t e d
wo r l d w i d e .Would it not be best to enable
plants to fight diseases and pests by
t h e m s e l ves? This is the proposal of the
transgenic revolution which is curr e n t l y
sweeping the world of agri c u l t u r e .
In 1953 James Watson (USA) and
Francis Crick (UK) discovered the spi-
ral structure of deox y ribonucleic acid
( D N A ) , but it was not until thirty ye a rs
l ater that the first gene transfer wa s
m a d e , in the laborat o ry, on a tobacco
p l a n t .The first field tests were conducted
in 1987 and the technique then took off.
A decade lat e r , genetically modified
crops were gr owing on 15 million hec-
tares of land around the globe. In 1998,
United States fa rm e rs alone sowed 20
million hectares of genetically modifie d
m a i z e , s oya and cotton. Argentina and
Brazil have accepted genetically modifie d
organisms (GMOs), and so have China
and A u s t r a l i a . By the year 2000, g e n e t i-
cally modified crops are expected to be
gr owing on 60 million hectares wo r l d-
wide–81 per cent of them in North A m e-
ri c a , 10 per cent in
Asia and one per cent
in Europe. In the Uni-
ted States alone, t h e y
will comprise a $100-
billion market over the
next decade.
W hy this spectacu-
lar expansion? Fa rm e rs

va rieties and species

Pe l t , “this painstaking work by agr o n o-
mists has always taken place within the
b a rri e rs between species. . . . B a rri e rs
s t rictly delimiting a gi ven species,
without the chance of hy b ri d i z ation with
o t h e rs , e x c e p t , p o s s i b l y, closely relat e d
s p e c i e s.” Genetic modification makes
light of all these barri e rs. T h e o r e t i c a l l y
gene transfer makes all kinds of things
p o s s i b l e . Plants are already capable of
producing haemoglobin, a gr owth hor-
m o n e , and human insulin.
The support e rs of transgenic agri c u l-
ture point to other adva n t a g e s. If a plant
has a gene which resists certain pests, t h e r e
is no need for it to be
treated with a chemical
which threatens the
health of the person who
applies it and pollutes
soil and wat e r.It can also
be given a gene to make
it resistant to a herbicide,
enable it to survive cold
or drought, and eve n
change its taste or nutri-
tional qualities.
So are GMOs the
key to the future of
a griculture? Cert a i n l y
n o t , s ay its detractors. F i rs t , b e c a u s e
genetically modified crops favour large-
scale industrial agriculture to the detri-
ment of small fa rm e rs and the countri e s
of the South. If small fa rm e rs opt for
genetically modified seeds, their costs

Genetically modified plants are being developed so quickly that they
could become the backbone of tomorrow’s agriculture. For better or
for worse?
In 1998,
United States farmers
alone sowed

of genetically 
modified maize,

rise and they will have to sign contracts
with transnational firms like Monsanto,
N ova rt i s , A gr E vo, D u p o n t , Pioneer or
R h ô n e - Poulenc and buy seeds from them
e ve ry ye a r , as well as the herbicides the
plants are treated to resist. One example
is Round-Up Ready, the genetically
modified rapeseed produced by Mon-
s a n t o, which is resistant to Round-Up, a
herbicide made by the same firm .
In addition, if we
become capable of
producing substances
tasting like, vanilla or
cocoa from plants
which can stand up to
the climates of the nor-
t h e rn hemisphere, fa r-
m e rs in pove rt y - s t ri c-
ken countries may lose
their meagre source of

to the A m e rican Bio-
technology Industry
O r g a n i z at i o n , things are less alarm i n g . I t
gi ves examples of technology transfers
such as the passing on to a research ins-
titute in Indonesia of mat e rial to produce
insect-resistant potatoes by tissue cul-
t u r e , and the insertion of a fungi c i d a l
gene into A f rican bananas.
Since research in this field is ve ry
c o s t l y, genetically modified plants are
usually pri vatized through pat e n t i n g .
M o n s a n t o, with an annual turn over of
more than $6.6 billion, s ays it spent $166
million last year on GMO research, bu t
refuses to say how many patents it
applied for. Small companies and the
c o u n t ries of the South stand no chance
against the big transnational firm s.
Taking out a patent is highly expen-
s i ve . For it to be valid in all the rich coun-
t ri e s , an initial deposit of about $84,000 is
r e q u i r e d , plus a tax which increases expo-
nentially during the life of the pat e n t . B y
the end of last ye a r , 1,377 patents for
genetically modified plants had been
applied for at the Euro-
pean Patent Office.
S e veral hundred of
them are curr e n t l y
awaiting examinat i o n .
Does this mean
t h at Europe has not
been won over by
GMOs? The import of
genetically modified
maize and rapeseed
has been authorized by
the European Union
since 1997 and will
this year amount to $200 million. B u t
some countries have expressed doubts.
A u s t ria and Luxembourg have forbidden
i m p o rts and Italy has banned gr owing of
G M O s. In A p ril 1997, the European
Parliament opposed the European
C o m m i s s i o n ’s approval of such

mic and social pressures
h ave ove rridden health
and env i r o n m e n t a l
c o n s i d e r at i o n s ” .
The introduction of
antibiotic-resistant genes
into plants is also causing concern ,but there
is no proof that such genes are passed from
plants to animals and then to humans. I n
this case the gene acts as a marker in a gene
transfer process. To find out whether the
t r a n s f e rred gene is present in the cells, t h e y
are soaked in an antibiotic solution. O n l y
the cells which have not accepted the resis-
tant gene are destroyed. For example, the
Flavr Savr tomato produced in the United
S t ates in 1994 contains a gene to keep it
firm and slow the rotting process,along with
a gene resistant to kanamy c i n ,which is used
to fight respirat o ry ailments.A single muta-
tion of this gene also makes it resistant to
other antibiotics used to treat meningi t i s
and serious lung diseases.The resistant gene

Genetic modific a t i o n : how it works
The nucleus of each cell contains
chromosomes made up of genes
which govern heredity. Genes are
sequences of long molecules arran-
ged in the form of a double helix
and known as DNA (deoxyribonu-
cleic acid). DNA sees that the cell
functions in a way specific to the
species to which it belongs. A single
gene can determine several charac-
t e r i s t i c s, but sometimes several
genes are needed to determine a
single characteristic. Molecular bio-
logists cut up the genome (the
genetic endowment) of a given spe-
c i e s, increase the number of genes
and insert them into another spe-
cies to obtain a new hereditary cha-
racteristic coded by the transferred
D N A . This is how genetically modi-
fied organisms (GMOs) are obtai-
n e d .
In the laboratory, though not yet
on our plates, maize has been
given a scorpion’s gene so that it
can resist insects and a petunia
gene to enable it to resist herbi-
c i d e s. Potatoes have been endowed
with a gene from a chicken or a
moth to fight disease, as well as a
human gene to digest heavy
m e t a l s. A fish gene can be added
to tomatoes to help them resist the
c o l d , and rice and sunflower seeds
can be protein-enriched with genes
t a ken from beans and brazil nuts
r e s p e c t i v e l y. Cucumbers fight
disease with the help of a tobacco
g e n e. All kinds of things are imagi-
n a b l e, if not immediately feasible: a
gene from a bird with black fea-
thers to colour roses, a lettuce gene
to camouflage cows in green mea-
d o w s. But beware of the hybrids
that might escape from the lab.
Truth may turn out to be stranger
than science fiction! ■

Can Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso keep his promise to save 25 mil-
lion more hectares of Amazonian forest by the
year 2000? The World Bank and the Wo r l d
Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) see his pledge,
made at the end of April 1998,as one of the
first fruits of their June 1997 agreement to
strengthen measures to protect “ n a t u r a l ”
f o r e s t s, i . e. those largely untouched by human
activity.
The accord aims to set up a worldwide net-
work of protected areas totalling 50 million
hectares by 2005.It is an extension of WWF’s
campaign to bring,by the end of the century,
10% of every type of forest (tropical,Boreal,
t e m p e r a t e, d r y, humid) under protection from
the pillage which is slowly eating away at the
planet’s biodiversity.
Only 6% of the world’s natural forests are
legally protected at the moment, with wide
regional variations–from 9% in Latin A m e r i c a
to 2% in Europe. But often this protection only
exists on paper. Many forests are being dama-
ged by pollution from oilfields or mining (legal
protection does not extend underground) and
by continuing illegal activities.Eighty per cent
of Brazil’s mahogany, for example, comes from
protected forest areas.
By promising to extend protected areas,
B r a z i l , which contains a third of all the world’s
tropical forests, has declared its determina-
tion to break with policies which have paid
little heed to sustainable management.
Now the money has to be found.Brazil has
very few means of enforcing protection and
“there are only 300 people to monitor all of
A m a z o n i a ,” notes W W F ’s Jean-Paul Jeanre-
n a u d , who reckons that the project requires
about $75 million immediately and $10 million
a year thereafter.
The World Bank is expected to help Brazil
obtain contributions from the rich countries
and the private sector. Without them, P r e s i-
dent Cardoso’s promise may be an empty one.

containing GMOs, clear labelling is

Shipments of imported fa rm produce
often contain mixtures. Unless they are
sure of their suppliers , the big food firm s
will have to carry out costly and elabo-

able to make a free and informed choice.
For this, we need to wait until more is

Half a century ago, whales nearly died
out as a species as a result of being
indiscriminately hunted. Th e n , in 1946, t h e
International Convention for the Regulation
of Whaling was signed and its management
put in the hands of the International W h a-
ling Commission (IWC), which recently cele-
brated its fiftieth birthday.
Today whale hunting has virtually cea-
s e d , except by the Japanese and the Nor-
w e g i a n s, who kill about 1,200 minke
whales each year out of a population of
about a million. But although hunting may
have been sharply curbed, whales are still
in danger–from pollution.
The IWC has not been able to enforce
totally the moratorium on whaling it intro-
duced in 1986, but the measure has
enabled the population of great whales to
i n c r e a s e. Now the Commission has take n
on a new task–protecting the environment
to safeguard whales, and by so doing to
ensure its own surviva l .
The commission’s 40 Member States,
dominated by English-speaking countries,
especially the United States, have realized
that passing resolutions which were mostly
ignored was not enough. Despite their
infringements of the moratorium, Japan and
N o r way refuse to leave the commission and
have obstructed its work, helped by several
small Caribbean states.
But all agreed at the IWC’s meeting in
Muscat (Oman) in May 1998 that a dete-
riorating environment was now “the big-
gest threat” to whales. The Commission’s
s c i e n t i fic committee will give “the highest
p r i o r i t y ” to research into the impact of pol-
lutants and chemical contamination on
w h a l e s, as well as the effect of climate
change on the biological and physical habi-
tat of whales and their prey.
The A r c t i c , where whale meat is now so
contaminated it has become dangerous for
human consumption, will be studied fir s t .
In recent years, scientists have found that
w h a l e s, as animals at the end of a food
c h a i n , have absorbed large quantities of
poisonous pollutants of all kinds, i n c l u d i n g
p e s t i c i d e s, chlorine compounds and heavy
m e t a l s. ■

For years ‘community mothers’ have been helping to bring up children in
Colombia, a country plagued by violence and poverty
In the mid-1980s, the Colombian
g ove rn m e n t , a l a rmed by ve ry high
r ates of infant mortality and malnu-
t ri t i o n , launched a far-reaching pro-
gramme to protect pre-school-age chil-
d r e n , with the help of the United Nat i o n s
and the Inter-American Deve l o p m e n t
B a n k .
The first “ we l fare centres”, a l s o
k n own as h o b i s, opened in the slums of
C a l i , an industrial city of almost two mil-
lion people, in Cart a g e n a , w h o s e
550,000 inhabitants live mainly off the
petrochemical industry, and Guspi, a
small town in the southwest of the coun-
t ry. They were run by vo l u n t e e rs know n
as “community mothers ” who organized,
on their own or with the help of NGOs,
e d u c ation and care facilities for about
3,000 children. The programme initially
reached only 7 per cent of the popula-
tion concern e d .
K i n d e r g a rtens for the children of
working mothers appeared in Colombia
in 1974. But a new educational model
a rri ved in 1977 with “ n e i g h b o u r h o o d
c e n t r e s ” based on parental and commu-
nity part i c i p at i o n . These centres soon
opened their doors to ve ry poor children,
with the help of UNICEF and the
Colombian Institute for Family We l fa r e
( I C B F ) , an official body with ministeri a l
p owe rs in charge of policy concern i n g
the family and the protection of minors.
In 1987, the ICBF funneled 8 per cent of
its funds to the community mothers and
offered them an institutional framewo r k .
To d ay, the figure is 40 per cent.
The $55 million ICBF programme now
reaches 60 per cent of ve ry needy children in
1,042 towns in a country where, a c c o r d i n g
to figures provided by the United Nat i o n s
D e velopment Programme (UNDP), o n e
p e rson in five gets by on
less than two dollars a
d ay. It won part i c u l a r

t a ri n a, a powdered mix
of milk,p r o t e i n ,i r o n ,a n d
flour made from soy-
b e a n s , w h e at , maize or
rice supplied free by the
g ove rnment through the
community mothers
n e t wo r k .
The “ m o t h e rs ” , who now number
82,000, are becoming increasingly impor-
tant and are in gr e at demand by fa m i l i e s
d i s rupted by the violence, which as of
Ja n u a ry 1998 had forcibly dri ven 1.1 million
people (42,000 families) from their homes.
Each mother takes about fifteen chil-
dren into her home and gets the equiva-
lent of about half the legal minimum
wage (about $130 a month) and the ri g h t
to social security and a pension. A p a rt
from food for her group (which she can
also gi ve to her own children), the ICBF
p r ovides utensils and a few staple items.
It also grants a small loan to install sepa-
r ate washing and toilet facilities for the
children and to improve hy giene in the
k i t c h e n , the eating areas, the bedrooms
and the court ya r d , where the children
spend most of their time. About a mil-
lion and a half chil-
d r e n , aged from two to
s e ve n , are looked after
and socialized in this
way before they go to
s c h o o l , while their real
m o t h e rs are out at
wo r k .
The community
m o t h e rs do their best to
adapt their hours to
those of the working parents, but as a rule
they look after the children between eight in
the morning and four in the afternoon from
Monday to Friday.They organize their day
t h e m s e l ve s , guided by the ICBF’s educa-
tional aims, which focus on making the chil-
dren aware of values such as solidari t y,
f riendship and respect for differences.A c t i-

dren through games, with an emphasis on
social skills; using role-playing to fa m i l i a-
rize them in groups with real-life situat i o n s ,
like going shopping or visiting the doctor;
and allowing the children to express them-
s e l ves by talking about their personal expe-
riences or even describing their dreams.
An apprenticeship 
in social skills
The activities va ry according to the age
of the child, with the older ones being
introduced to the main school subjects if
the community mother is capable of
doing this. O ver the past twenty ye a rs ,
the mothers have managed, often with
s u p p o rt of NGOs, to acquire more skills
and undeniable social recognition, bu t
m a ny have not managed to finish their
s c h o o l i n g, and some cannot even read.
“There is no official cert i f i c ate which
s ays you can be a community mother,”
s ays Lilia Labrador, the ICBF’s head of
pre-school educat i o n , “ but they have a
chance to study to secondary school gr a-
d u ation level through coaching schemes
recognized by the education ministry.”
Before being hired, the “ m o t h e rs ” g o
on a short course to prepare for their
future role and take a self-assessment
t e s t . Such workshops are held at inter-
va l s , a l l owing the participants to discuss
their experiences and work out together
a ny problems. These courses gi ve some
community mothers a chance to take up
other work and skills or be chosen for
other ICBF programmes such as fa m i l y
e d u c ation or education for pregnant
wo m e n .
Substantial funds are needed to ru n
all these activities. A p a rt from contri bu-
tions from intern ational organizat i o n s ,
companies are obliged by law to chip in
with three per cent of their total wa g e
b i l l . Keeping tabs on that is not easy
Fighting for recognition
Though officially recruited by
school parents’ associations,
community mothers are in fact
drawn from the ranks of very needy
women who offer their services to
regional ICBF offices which are
eager to expand their  network
q u i c k l y, even if it means dealing
later with problems of quality.
Several h o b i s (welfare centres) are
required to make up a parents’
a s s o c i a t i o n . The mothers can
legally stand for election to an
a s s o c i a t i o n ’s committee but ICBF
officials usually frown on this. I n
the early years in some regions,
they even openly opposed it and
refused to hire some women who
were elected. It took many years of
struggle before the mothers won
recognition from ICBF officials.
Parents and mothers often argue
about how to use ava i l a b l e
r e s o u r c e s. Some mothers have
accused heads of parents’ associa-
tions of dipping their fingers in the
k i t t y, not replacing worn-out uten-
s i l s, being unwilling to guarantee
loans to improve their premises,
and charging a new recruit  an
entrance fee when her predecessor
has left without paying back her
l o a n .
At first there was a big turnover
among the poorest mothers. Th e y
were drawn more by the chance of
a house improvement loan than by
the job itself, which proved more
thankless than they imagined, a n d
many left soon after being recrui-
t e d . E v e n t u a l l y, things settled
d o w n , after the mothers won
battles for social security coverage
and for better training and working
c o n d i t i o n s.
The mothers were quick to set
up their own organizations to press
for improvements in the pro-
g r a m m e. The ICBF was cautious at
first about this unionization and
stressed publicly that the mothers
were volunteers or employees of
the parents’ associations and that
their salary was a bonus.
The mothers retorted that 
the ICBF could not duck its respon-
s i b i l i t i e s, since it has chosen to
define even the smallest details of
the rules, closely monitoring time-
t a b l e s, meal menus, w o r k i n g
m e t h o d s, p u n c t u a l i t y, numbers pre-
s e n t , hygiene and budgetary mat-
t e r s, leaving very little to the
mothers and parents.
So a union soon sprung up,
along with an association called
A m c o l o m b i a . G r a d u a l l y, r e g i o n a l
associations grew up and dialogue
developed between the two sides.
This is how the mothers won the
rights they enjoy today. ■

money has to be scraped together where-
ver it can be found. For example, p u b l i c
l aw 333 of December 1996 stipulat e s
t h at the proceeds of money, houses and
vehicles seized from drug smugglers by
the national narcotics authority must go
to support street children.
But things are not so simple. S y l v i a n e
B o u r g e t e a u , r e p r e s e n t at i ve in Bogota of a
French watchdog on dru g s , the Observa-
toire Geopolitique des Drogues, s ays the
l aw has “ n e ver been applied.” A p a rt from
the inheritance tangles that arise after
d rug seizures, the new occupants of
houses confis c ated from drug smugglers
often get threatened or are bu r g l e d . T h e
then Colombian gove rnment even admit-
ted on its official website last 24 March
t h at despite the seizure of about 20,000
items of propert y, only one such confis-
c ation had been legally confirm e d .
A l s o, seized property does not alway s
fit the practical needs of the we l fare orga-
n i z at i o n s. The houses are ve ry luxuri o u s
and need costly refurbishing. S o m e t i m e s
when a bus is needed to take some chil-
dren somewhere, the only vehicle ava i-
lable is a Rolls Royce Gucci.
So the measure has its limits, but they
are not insuperable. Just before public
l aw 333 was passed, the ICBF managed
to conve rt a former disco seized from
d rug smugglers in the chic Zona Rosa
area of Bogota into a centre for haemo-
p h i l i a c s. And more recently, the lat e s t

young people was financed by money sei-

The flow of thousands of experts and
technicians from developing countries to
rich ones is increasingly seen as a source of
potential for the former, rather than a loss.
Thanks to new technologies, k n o w l e d g e
now moves around the world very quickly.
Over the past decade, many countries,
especially in Latin A m e r i c a , have set up pro-
grammes to put the knowledge of these
“ l o s t ” experts to good use. E x a m p l e s
i n c l u d e :
- The Inter-Regional Network of Latin
American and Caribbean Scientists. Its data-
b a s e, created in 1994, keeps details of trai-
ned citizens who have gone abroad. I t
responds to the technological and scientific
needs of member countries by inviting
these international experts to conferences.
It will, for example, be represented at the
regional governmental conference on
science which will be held in October in
B a r i l o c h e, A r g e n t i n a .
- Caldas, set up in 1991, e n c o u r a g e s
Colombian experts around the world to
contribute to scientific and technological
progress by publicizing the results of their
r e s e a r c h . It includes joint projects involving
experts at home and abroad. E-mail com-
munication is one of its main activities.
- Talven (Venezuelan Talent A b r o a d ) ,
launched in 1994. It targets not only scien-
tists and high-tech experts but also Ve n e-
zuelans active in the arts and the humani-
t i e s. Talven attempts to persuade them to
return home not permanently, but from
time to time. With financial backing from
p r i vate firms and institutions, more than
120 Venezuelans have been able to return
and make contact with colleagues by taking
part in seminars and workshops. Th i s
exchange of experiences is contributing to
the country’s development in areas as
diverse as A i d s, c o m p u t e r s, economics and,
in recent months, p a r a s i t o l o g y, m o l e c u l a r
b i o l o g y, waste recycling and biotechnology.

the Development of Education
adopted a new approach to the
idea of education, long regar-
ded solely as a school-centred
a c t i v i t y. The report, whose title
was Learning to Be, said that
education should no longer be
defined as a specific body of
knowledge that had to be
d i g e s t e d , but as a process whe-
reby people, through the va r i e t y
of their experiences, learn to
express themselves, to commu-
n i c a t e, to question the world
and to become themselves.Th i s
approach formed the basis of
an agreement between govern-
ments and funding agencies
when the Declaration on Edu-
cation for All was adopted in
1990 at the World Conference
on Education for A l l , at Jomtien,
in Th a i l a n d .
The traditional distinction
between formal and non-for-
mal education was thus super-
s e d e d . Informal learning, c o m-
prising activit ies outside
established systems, b r i d g e s
the gap between institution-
centred education and the
socio-economic and cultural
e n v i r o n m e n t . It has proved its
worth over the last 30 years
and is now expanding rapidly.

Once upon a time students belonged to a small elite for whom a university
degree was the passport into an educated caste which held the keys to
knowledge. Today they number millions. Nearly every country in the world is
offering higher education to more and more young people each year. But for
what purpose? What are these students looking for? A stairway to higher
social status? The guarantee of a good job? Universities and other higher
education institutions must be tuned in to the demands of the job market and
changing societies. Faced with new challenges, higher education still has a
long way to go before it can offer students the opportunities they are seeking
and which the world’s economies, in North and South alike,
seem less and less able to provide.

18 The UNESCO Courier - September 1998
Shaking 
the ivory tower
Universities have changed radically to keep pace with modern life.
Now where are they heading in this high-speed age?
In the past half century higher education has
been transformed from a privilege conferred on
social and political elites to a mass activity ava i-
lable to whole populat i o n s.This process began in the
United States in the 1940s and 1950s, spread to
most of We s t e rn Europe and many other deve l o p e d
c o u n t ries during the 1960s and 1970s and in the
past two decades has become a global phenome-
non.In the next half century it will accelerate,lea-
ding perhaps to the replacement of “higher educa-
t i o n ”(still an elite-ish cat e g o ry despite its expansion)
by extended systems of “lifelong learning”.
The key to this transform ation has been the expan-
sion of secondary educat i o n .For example, in all bu t
t wo countries of the OECD (Organization for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development) at least two -
thirds of young people now complete upper secondary
e d u c at i o n , and so are eligible to enter higher educa-
t i o n .The result has been a dramatic increase in enrol-
ment rates in higher educat i o n . In Chile the total
number of students has gr own from 131,000 in 1978
to 235,000 in 1988 and to 343,000 in the mid-1990s.
E ven in the United Stat e s , the pioneer of mass-access
higher education where ve ry high secondary educa-
tion completion rates had already been achieve d
before 1970, the student population has continued to
gr ow, from 11 million in 1978 to 13 million in 1988
and now to more than 14 million.
Two forces have dri ven up completion rates in
upper secondary education and enrolment rates in
higher educat i o n .The first has been democrat i z at i o n .
As late as 1945 high levels of social, and hence edu-
c at i o n a l , inequality persisted even in democratic coun-
t ri e s , and much of the world remained in the grip of
colonial and totalitarian powe rs. In North A m e ri c a ,
We s t e rn Europe and Australasia democrat i z ation typi-
cally took the form of the development of “ we l fa r e
s t at e s ” , in which there was an increase in public expen-
diture on educat i o n ,h o u s i n g,health and social secu-
rity that was sustained over more than three decades
after the end of the Second World Wa r.
More recently, as renewed emphasis has been
placed on the market even in social policy, the rise of
c o n s u m e rism has continued to fuel demands for
increased higher education opport u n i t i e s.The older
idea of education as a civic entitlement has been com-
pounded by newer notions of free access to the edu-
c ation marketplace.Far from arresting the advance to
mass higher educat i o n ,c o n s u m e rism has accelerat e d
it in most developed countri e s.As traditional form s
of social differentiation based on class,gender and eth-
nic ori gin have been eroded by democrat i z ation and
by market forces, new forms based on educat i o n a l
c e rt i fic ation have become more import a n t . In many
d e veloped countries the middle class and the “ gr a-
d u ate class” h ave tended to coalesce.
In much of Asia and A f rica democrat i z ation took
the form of decolonizat i o n . In newly independent
c o u n t ries the energy ori ginally generated in libera-
tion struggles against the colonial powe rs was direc-
ted into a wider struggle to create fairer and more
equal successor societies. E d u c ation was central to
this stru g g l e .The result has been a rapid increase in
higher education enrolment–for example, in Tu n i s i a
from barely 2,000 students at the time of indepen-
dence to more than 100,000 today.T h at process conti-
n u e s.
H owe ve r , the relationship between democrat i z a-
tion and the development of higher education has
been less straightforward in developing countri e s.
Despite ve ry rapid rates of expansion the “ m e t r o p o-
l i t a n ”i n fluences of the former colonial powe rs have
lingered more stubbornly in higher education than at
other levels of educat i o n .This is partly due to the
continued influence of associations between unive r-
sities in the British Commonwealth as well as those
b e t ween francophone unive rs i t i e s.
Pa rtly because of these lingering “ m e t r o p o l i-
tan”models and partly because levels of participa-
tion are still lower than in developed countri e s ,m a ny
African or Asian universities have remained more
elite institutions than higher education institutions
in North America and Europe. Also, as economic
conditions have wo rsened in some developing coun-
tries,the competition between primary and higher
e d u c ation sharpened in the post-independence ye a rs
as both were seen as equally important priorities.
This competition was often reinforced by the inter-
vention of the World Bank.
The second force driving up higher education
enrolments has been the changing nature of the
labour market.Traditional occupations have become
c o m p a r at i vely less signific a n t , while new serv i c e
o c c u p at i o n s , which often require gr a d u at e - l e ve l

skills,have become more important.
Skill requirements have become more sophisti-
cated. Jobs once done by unskilled or semi-skilled
wo r k e rs are now undertaken by technicians; a n d
those which as recently as the 1980s were taken by
technicians are now likely to be filled by graduates.
The capital invested for eve ry worker has more than
doubled in the past 20 years. Even in occupations
where there is less evidence that skills contents have
changed signific a n t l y, u n i ve rsity gr a d u ates are now
e m p l oyed in much larger numbers ,p a rtly to enhance
the social status of these occupations and partly to
compete in a graduate-dominated labour market.
Healthcare is a good example. Once doctors were the
only graduates;today, many para-medical workers
are also trained in higher education.
The second form taken by the economic driver
has been the growing conviction that national suc-
cess now depends on economic competitive n e s s
w h i c h , in the context of a knowledge-based eco-
n o my, depends in turn on an adequate supply of
human capital. Knowledge is now seen as the key
economic resource.
This analysis may be exaggerat e d ;r aw mat e ri a l s
are still ve ry important in national economies and the
global economy. But it has become pervasive–and
persuasive.The naïve and linear theories of human
capital popular a generation ago which postulated a
direct link between investment in education and
economic growth may have been challenged;some
f o rms of higher education are now as likely to be
labelled consumption as investment goods. Never-
t h e l e s s , the discourse of the “ K n owledge Society”h a s
become even more powerful.
The impact of democratization and economic
c o m p e t i t i veness on higher education has been
immense.First,the expansion of student numbers
has made the cost of higher education a significant
element within national budgets for the first time.A
number of important consequences has flowed from
this–the opport u n i t y, and incentive , to compare the
value of investing in different levels of educat i o n ;
increasing demands that unive rsities are run as effi-
ciently as possible (compromising their traditional
a u t o n o my from the state–and the market); l owe r
unit costs as budgets have been trimmed (which
may have undermined higher education’s claim to
represent academic excellence). S e c o n d ,higher edu-
c ation systems have emerged that embrace not only
traditional universities but also non-university ins-
t i t u t i o n s.Two effects have been produced. One is that
the ethos of the traditional university has been ero-
ded; it no longer stands in glorious isolation.The
other is that institutional differentiation has been
e n c o u r a g e d , whether through active state planning
or in response to markets for teaching and research.
The prospects for the next half century are for an
a c c e l e r ation of both dri ve rs–to include access to higher
e d u c ation among the basic entitlements enjoyed by citi-
zens in democratic societies;and to “put knowledge to
wo r k ”in order to generate wealth and to improve the
quality of life.The prospects for higher educat i o n
d u ring the same period are also relat i vely easy to pre-
dict–increased efficiency (which is likely to include
gr owing pressure to make students contri bute more to
the cost of their higher educat i o n ) ; gr e ater accounta-

b i l i t y, although more probably in a “ m a r k e t ” than a
“ p l a n n i n g ”mode as even the state redefines its role as
the purchaser of higher education serv i c e s ; more dif-
f e r e n t i at i o n , both between and within higher educa-
tion institutions, as they struggle to identify market
n i c h e s ; a n d – p o s s i b l y – gr owing demands that higher
e d u c ation become more relevant as instru m e n t a l
c o n s i d e r ations triumph over idealistic ones.
H owe ve r ,the future may be more complex than the
p a s t . In the second half of the 20th century the encoun-
ter between higher education and society has been
c o m p a r at i vely straightforwa r d . Although dynamic,
society has presented a familiar enough fa c e . It was cha-
r a c t e rized by a combination of bu r e a u c r atic rat i o n a-
lity and secular (and liberal) individualism.The bene-
ficence of science and technology was uncontested.T h e
dominant economic model was of large-scale indus-
t ry, or analogous organizations in the corp o r ate and
public sectors. Although rapidly evo l v i n g, c o n c e p t s
and cat e g o ries like “ c a r e e r ” and “ p r o f e s s i o n ”r e m a i-
ned va l i d .Higher education too was familiar enough.
Despite the gr e at expansion of student numbers and
its adoption of novel roles, the unive rsity continued to
be recognizable as such. Other types of higher edu-
c ation institution have been deeply influenced by uni-
ve rsity values and practices.
In the first half of the 21st century both society
and higher education may become problemat i c a l
and so contested categories. Some of these uncer-
tainties are already emerging.Once firm demarca-
tions between public and pri vate domains, w h e t h e r
in terms of the balance between the state and the
market or between social “spaces” and individual
d e s i r e s ; b e t ween producers and users ; b e t we e n
i nvestment and consumption; b e t ween work and
leisure are becoming increasingly fuzzy in the emer-
ging post-industrial society.Wealth is being generat e d
by the production of “ s y m b o l i c ” as well as–or more
t h a n – m at e rial goods. Value is created by design,
s a l e s ,m a r k e t i n g, s e rvice rather than by pri m a ry pro-
d u c t i o n . Institutions of all kinds, civic and corp o r at e ,
are being challenged by the rise of adaptable and
flexible organizat i o n s ,made possible by advances in
communications and information technology.
The force of globalization amounts to much
more than round-the-clock round-the-world fin a n-
cial markets or an emerging intern ational division of
l a b o u r; it is not only undermining nation states bu t
also reconfig u ring time and space to produce global
intimacies, again with the help of the information
r e vo l u t i o n . Social identities are no longer moulded
by the “givens”of religion, class and gender,or by
positions within the occupational stru c t u r e , as they
have been since the advent of the industrial revolu-
tion in Europe two centuries ago. Instead they are
being subsumed by a process of individualizat i o n
in which life-styles rather than life-chances predo-
minate.
The superi o rity of science is now being underm i-
ned by the gr owth of what the German sociologi s t
U l rich Beck has called the “ risk society”, in which
ri s k s , especially environmental threat s , seem to be
a c c u m u l ating faster than the benefits produced by
social improvements and technological adva n c e s.T h e
i n s t rumental rationality on which We s t e rn notions of
m o d e rn i z ation depend is being challenged by what
B e c k ’s French colleague Alain Touraine has term e d
“new modern i t y ” in which Reason and Subject are
recombined in the form of new social move m e n t s.
Higher education will have not only to continue to
s atisfy the predictable demands for democratic entit-
lement and socio-economic utility with which it is
fa m i l i a r , but also to cope with the consequences of
these new uncert a i n t i e s.These may include:new cur-
ricula that emphasize style and images at the expense
of skills and inform at i o n ; r e c at e g o ri z ation of higher
e d u c ation as a play f u l ,e ven selfis h ,a c t i v i t y ; a tighter
link between experience of higher education and social
e s t e e m ; submergence of the unive rs a l ,but also part i-
c u l a r ,values characteristic of the traditional unive rs i t y
by anomic globalizat i o n ;t h r e ats to the scientific tra-
dition and methods, from the “ risk society”, from sub-
j e c t i v i z ation and from demands that other know l e d g e
traditions are accorded equal respect.
The universities of the 21st century, therefore,
may have to face two ways.They will have to conti-
nue to pay attention to the democrat i z ation and the
“ k n owledge society”a g e n d a s , which are likely both
to be subsumed in a larger “lifelong learn i n g ”
a g e n d a . Their ability to sustain current levels of
public funding and to satisfy their student-custo-
mers will depend on their success in this respect.It
will not be easy.There is a danger that the essence
of higher education will be lost if it succumbs to
unconstrained populism. If this happens, the “ q u a-
l i t y ” of the unive rsity will disappear–and with it per-
haps its distinctiveness and so its utility and mar-
k e t a b i l i t y. Similarly in the Knowledge Society of the
future the unive rsity will face new ri vals because all
organizations will need to become “learning orga-
n i z at i o n s ” .These ri va l s ’ strength will be increased if
the superiority of universal science is successfully
challenged.
But unive rsities will also have to address the new
agendas–of the “ d e at h ” of work (and gr a d u at e
c a r e e rs ? ) , of new social movements (and the erosion
of individual enlightenment?), of globalization and
v i rt u a l i z ation (and the undermining of academic com-
m u n i t y ? ) ; of “ a l t e rn at i ve ”k n owledge traditions and,

September 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 21
For more than 900 ye a rs , the unive rsity has been
remarkably active in “ e x p o rting itself” .T h e
gr e at medieval unive rsities of Pa ri s , O x f o r d
and Prague drew on the experience of Bologna,
sometimes held to be the earliest unive rsity of them
a l l .So it is hardly surp rising if the inspiration of some
f o rms the basis of others.But no higher education sys-
tem is exactly the same as its neighbours.
For all their va ri e t y,the way most systems of higher
e d u c ation have developed harks back to what may
be seen as four referential and historical models of the
u n i ve rs i t y :the Napoleonic model (France), the Hum-
boldtian (Germ a ny ) ,the “ m a r k e t - d ri ve n ”model (the
United States) and the model of higher educat i o n
e q u ated with the United Kingdom. Until recently,
the so-called “ S oviet model”and its deri vat i ves from
a command economy might well have figured
amongst the ranks of these “system shaping”m o d e l s.
The Napoleonic model is one of the earliest
examples of the state harnessing the unive rsity to the
m o d e rn i z ation of society. It did this by maintaining
close control over fin a n c i n g,over academic appoint-
ments and the use of legal instruments to ensure
t h at national provision was similar across the nat i o-
nal territory. In its classic form, the “Napoleonic”
university is a powerful lever in asserting a singular
national identity, based on the principles of formal
equality and merit which are themselves both defi-
ned and upheld by a powerful national administra-
t i o n . In addition to France, this pat t e rn ranged ove r
such countries as Spain and Italy, and is also to be
seen in Argentina and many of the French-spea-
king African nations.
The Humboldtian model of unive rs i t y, so called
after Wilhelm von Humboldt,a radical reformer of the
P russian higher education system in the early 19th
c e n t u ry, is often seen as being at the ori gins of the
p r e s e n t - d ay “research unive rs i t y ” committed to
“ a d vancing the frontiers of know l e d g e ” .H u m b o l d t
attached special importance to the freedom of senior
m e m b e rs of the unive rsity to pursue enquiry without
interference from gove rn m e n t .And more to the point,
g ove rnment should,he argued, ensure the freedom of
teaching and learn i n g . Most important of all, t h e
Humboldtian interp r e t ation placed on the unive r-
sity the duty to conduct both teaching and research.
The third model is that of the “market-driven”
university, best represented by the various systems
of higher education in the United States. Though
deeply influenced by the Humboldtian ethic, t h e
United States system contained three features which
set it off from its European counterparts.The first
was the emphasis upon “useful know l e d g e ” ; t h e
second,its close ties with the local community;the
third,and perhaps the source of its most powerful
appeal today, its close ties with the economy.The
United States was the first to develop a mass higher
education system,more than half a century ago.
The fourth referential system is that of the Uni-
ted Kingdom. It is often cited as an outstanding
example of a unive rsity system enjoying immense ins-
titutional autonomy. University independence was
once ensured by a unique system of funding by
which gove rnments left the responsibility for dis-
t ri buting public money to the unive rsities them-
s e l ve s. B ritish unive rsities were well known for their
attention to student personal development in addi-
tion to intellectual prowess. Important too was the
idea of residentiality as the basis of an academic
c o m m u n i t y. Students lived on campus. A system
long devoted to an elite educat i o n , the United King-
dom was relat i vely late in reaching massific at i o n ,
doing so only in the course of the 1980s.
These models, in their different way s ,h ave sha-
ped the wo r l d ’s unive rs i t i e s , especially in the post-
1950 peri o d , when most of them were founded.B u t
the “ a r c h e t y p e s ”t h e m s e l ves have also changed.M a ny
of them look to developments in the wo r l d ’s largest
higher education system–the United States–as a
source of inspirat i o n .Whether this will alter as today ’s
ve rsion of globalization sets a premium on rapid
c h a n g e , and which will be the “ r e f e r e n t i a l ”s y s t e m s
in two decades, time alone will tell. ■

The future of a nation lies in the hands of the
yo u n g .For Indonesia, t h at is no ove rs t at e m e n t .
In May 1998, it was the students who caught
the wo r l d ’s attention by spearheading the dri ve to
u n s e at the nearly godlike figure of President Suhart o
from his more than thirt y - t wo - year presidency. B u t
after the jubilat i o n , the students woke up to find the
o ri ginal problems still there, with the economy col-
lapsing and politics getting murkier by the day.
“ W h at is the next move? Is this what you wa n t ? ”
a street vendor asks a student activist.Yet without a lar-
ger-than-life common enemy like the Suharto regi m e ,
students have too many wants and too few resources
to continue their move m e n t , in the absence of either
a nationwide organization or a shared agenda.
For the more radical students from the Ja k a rt a
City Fo ru m ,a loose gat h e ring of students from about
100 Ja k a rta unive rs i t i e s , a complete dismissal of the
parliament and gove rnment is in order.They want a
so-called Indonesian Pe o p l e ’s Committee to replace
the establishment and set up elections as soon as pos-
s i b l e .W hy? “Because we don’t trust all of the old ins-
t i t u t i o n s ,” yells a student leader.
Watching divergent desires polarize student lea-
d e rs and interest-led politicians lure student support
What do students
Thirty years ago, from Dakar to Mexico
City, from Paris to Berkeley, students
took to the streets to announce the
coming of a new world. Students have
often been in the forefront of
revolutions, and in several countries
have brought down seemingly
invincible regimes. But what do they
want today? This is not an easy
question to answer, if only because
their status is by definition temporary,
because the student population never
forms a stable and homogeneous
social group and student demands vary
according to their context. The dreams
of the students of 1968 in many
countries have given way to a realism
arising from the constraints of the late
twentieth century. Today’s students
want job opportunities more than
anything else. But they have not all
turned their back on the struggle for
ideals. On this double page, we present
reports on the student situation in
Germany and Indonesia.

Ge rman students took to the streets thirt y
ye a rs ago in a bid to ove rt u rn the “ b o u r-
g e o i s ” social order. N owa d ays the mood
could not be more different. G e rm a ny ’s 1.8 mil-
lion-plus students are learning to live in an era of high
unemployment and dwindling subsidies.
“ M a ny students are under the illusion that if
they work hard enough they’ll get a job,”s ays Carola
S c h m i d t , a fourth year history student at Berlin’s
Humboldt University.“But it’s not like that.Often
there are just no jobs.”
In the autumn of 1997,students staged a series
of strikes and protests to try and focus nat i o n a l
attention on their plight and the crisis ove r w h e l-
ming Germ a ny ’s institutes of higher educat i o n .T h e y
called for more money to be spent on upgr a d i n g
teaching and laboratory equipment,a comprehen-
sive review of government support for students as
well as reform of the country ’s higher educat i o n
system and moves to cut class sizes. Claudia Boege,
a student representat i ve at Frankfurt ’s Unive rs i t y
of Applied Science,b e l i e ves that public unive rs i t i e s
are facing the same difficulties as other parts of the
country’s social system.The problem is, she says,
“The politicians don’t have any new funding ideas.”

to their causes, the more dow n - t o - e a rth students are
r e t r e ating from the political arena, to regroup and
r e t u rn to their classes. “My students are going back
to campus to consolidate while keeping an eye on
the new gove rn m e n t ’s move s ,”s ays Sudart o, rector of
Airlangga Unive rsity in Surabaya .
But this consolidation is far from a reality.“ S p o n-
taneous student unity is close to impossible when
there is no political mainstream,” s ays Ismail, a now -
a p athetic former militant. And while the remaining
activists argue over competing agendas,o r d i n a ry stu-
dents have simpler desires. M a ri j o n o,a student from
Jombang in East Java say s :“ We do not want to be
fooled again, either by the gove rn m e n t , by the Inter-
n ational Monetary Fund or by self-acclaimed refor-
m i s t s.”
He and others like him would prefer to see pro-
gress in a field closer to daily life: e d u c at i o n .“ E d u-
c ational improvement should not be ignored. It is
the way to enhance our quality of life,” s ays Dadang
Budiana from the Indonesian Student A s s o c i at i o n
for Intern ational Studies.
Less than 10 per cent of the total national bu d g e t
is allocated to educat i o n . Most state unive rsity stu-
dents come from the middle class, which can afford
the preparation courses for the rigorous national uni-
ve rsity entrance exam.P ri vate unive rsities are expen-
s i ve .L ower-income youths are essentially left out in
the cold, without access to higher educat i o n .“ Po o r
students will always feel inferi o r ,” s ays Budiana.“ To
get a scholars h i p, they must write a letter, a p p r ove d
by the local gove rn m e n t ,s t ating they are ‘ fin a n c i a l l y
i n c a p a b l e ’ .”
L ower tuition fees are a key demand,according to
B u d i a n a .“The gove rnment should slash the military
budget and reallocate funds from superfluous high-tech
d e velopment for the sake of educating the people.”
Z a i n a l , a student from a poor village in East Java ,
c o u l d n ’t agree more.“ Poor guys like me can’t afford
to pay the tuition any m o r e .”But even the rich students
n ow are feeling the cru n c h .The fall of the rupiah has
t ripled the prices of foreign textbooks. “I can’t bu y
books any longer.They are unbelievably expensive ,”
s ays Iwa n , a student from pri vat e l y - run Tri s a k t i
U n i ve rs i t y.
For Indonesia’s politically puzzled and scholasti-
cally troubled students, helping ove rt h r ow the pre-
vious gove rnment now seems a lot easier than for-
ging their nat i o n ’s–and their ow n – f u t u r e . ■

want?
An uncertain future
Lost illusions
The movement largely ran out of steam, l e av i n g
behind a trail of frustration and anxiety about the
f u t u r e .“The mood among students today is,‘ well we
c a n ’t change the process, so we had better make the
most of it’,” s ays Herbert Dieter, a political scientist
with the University of Duisenberg.
Despite considerable media coverage of the
s t rikes and widespread public sympat hy towa r d s
the students’ c a u s e , Dieter believes that the pro-
blems of education in Germ a ny remain. In part i-
c u l a r , he says that underfunded German unive rs i t i e s
are not offering their students much hope of fin-
ding a place on an increasingly competitive job mar-
ket.With classes so full that there is often just one
professor for eve ry 600 undergr a d u at e s , s t u d e n t s
s ay they have virtually no contact with their tea-
chers.
If finding a job after unive rsity is the key issue for
G e rman students today, s u p p o rting themselve s
during their years of study has also become a high
priority for many of them.Higher education might
be free in Germany, but students still have to make
ends meet to pay for the rent and other expenses.
Students have also been demanding increased
g ove rnment financial support .The number receiving
income from the state has fallen in recent ye a rs and
is now down to about 17 per cent in the we s t e rn
part of the country, compared with 37 per cent 15
ye a rs ago. A similar picture emerges in the east,
where the number of students receiving gove rn-
ment support has dropped over the last four years
from 55 per cent to about 32 per cent.
As a consequence, the number of students wo r-
king and studying at the same time has risen in recent
ye a rs , while the percentage of undergr a d u ates from
l ower income families has fallen from 23 per cent in
1982 to 13 per cent last ye a r.Working while studying
also tends to exacerbate another problem facing Ger-
man higher educat i o n ,which is the number of ye a rs
spent in the halls of academia.This often means that
m a ny students do not take their first steps towards a
full-time career until they are about thirty ye a rs old.
Holding down a job while studying is also impor-
tant because the lifestyle of today’s students is less
f rugal than that of their predecessors of three decades
a g o. According to a survey of German undergr a-
duates published in May 1998,six out of ten had a
car and four out of ten had their own apartments.
“ To d ay ’s students,” s ays Schmidt,“like to have more
fun and to live an easier life than those of 1968.” ■

Wa n t e d : a new deal  
24 The UNESCO Courier - September 1998
‘Just as people take off
one garment and put
on another, it is
necessary to put the
old university in the
wardrobe and then
t a ke out the new one.’
José Martí, Cuba,
1853-1895
Higher education must meet new
demands in order to turn out well-trained
professionals instead of unemployed
graduates
We are living through a period of profound
h i s t o rical change, marked by an on-going
k n owledge revo l u t i o n . Society is chan-
ging far more quickly than the structures it has crea-
ted and the unive rsities are lagging behind these
c h a n g e s.T h e y, and the educational system in gene-
r a l , continue to teach the use of static processes,
forecasting models based on historical experience
and the memorizing of solutions to already solved
problems.
Higher education systems in both North and
South are in crisis,both quantitatively and qualita-
t i ve l y. N aturally the developing countries are the
hardest hit, both in terms of available resources and
levels of student enrolment (see box page 27).
Is the crisis due to a shortage of funds alone?
Does the fact that the countries of the North inve s t
ten times more per student than those of the South
mean that graduates from the former are ten times
better trained? Common sense says ye s. But in most
cases the answer is no. Generally speaking, univer-
sity education has failings all over the wo r l d , in some
c a s e s because it is an offspring of a wasteful society,
indifferent to the resources with which that society
provides them.
The missing link between
education and the world of work
In the United Stat e s , for example, m a ny teachers
and researchers come from developing societies
which should theoretically have gi ven them a less
sound training than that prov i d e d by the
immense academic and financial resources of the
United States system. But this is not the case:
they compete professionally and scientifically,
with no major problems. In many areas the
results of unive rsity training are comparable.
Professionals move around because they need
jobs and want to work in the best possible working
conditions.There are,for example, almost 30,000
A f rican Ph.Ds working in Europe and North A m e-
rica, and thousands of Latin American and Asian
professionals working in the United States. By the
b e ginning of the 1990s about a million professionals
had emigrated to the developed countries over the
previous three decades,and the figure has increased
considerably in the last five ye a rs.While the number
of opportunities and access to them are uneve n ,
there is little difference between North and South as
regards quality;nor is the availability of funding the
only basis for improving the system.
The problem is that post-secondary training
t o d ay is diploma-dri ve n . It is based on ri gi d
study programmes and is changing at a rat e
which takes little or no account of the speed of
k n owledge accumulat i o n .This is despite the fa c t
t h at today ’s gr a d u ate professional needs to have
f o l l owed a flexible curriculum and must be a
problem solve r , extremely adaptable to new pro-
cesses and technologi e s , generously endowe d
with creativity and firmly inclined towards life-
long learn i n g, as is clear from the studies on
skilled labour done by industrialized countri e s
and from numerous OECD studies.
A recent study of the relationship betwe e n
higher education and the labour market observe s
t h at there appears to be no connexion betwe e n
the increase in professionals’ l e vel of know l e d g e
and changes on the labour market. Although the

market undoubtedly demands basic skills and
k n ow l e d g e , it is attaching increasing import a n c e
to the emotional and psychological attitudes of
future employe e s. In Belgium and Swe d e n , t wo
of the countries with the lowest gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment levels (2.2 per cent and 2.1 per cent
r e s p e c t i ve l y ) , potential employe rs consider that
although unive rsity gr a d u ates are ve ry hardwo r-
king and possess an excellent knowledge of their
s p e c i a l i z at i o n , they are ill prepared for conditions
in the real world and show few signs of creat i v i t y,
adaptability and flexibility. This view has been
expressed in other countri e s , including Germ a ny,
Ja p a n , New Zealand, N o r way and the United
K i n g d o m .
Although post-secondary education is clearly
a s s o c i ated with higher personal incomes, l owe r
u n e m p l oyment and gr e ater opportunities to
climb the social ladder, u n e m p l oyment rates for
people with higher education qualificat i o n s
continue to be high in both North and South.
G r a d u ate unemployment in Europe, f o r
e x a m p l e , va ries between 1.4 per cent and 16.6
per cent depending on the country.W h at ’s more,
m a ny gr a d u ates are working in jobs outside their
field of training.The increase in gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment in the developing countries is largely
due to the drastic fall in demand from the major
e m p l oyer of gr a d u ates–the state–as a result of
i n t e rn ational competition and new political and
economic approaches.The pri vate sector is in no
position to absorb the supply of surplus gr a-
d u at e s. World Bank studies carried out in A s i a ,
the Middle East, N o rth A f rica and certain Lat i n
A m e rican countries show that gr a d u ate unem-
p l oyment is increasing: in Egypt it rose in barely
five ye a rs from 9.6 per cent to 16 per cent; i n
Venezuela it went from 4 per cent to 10.3 per
cent between 1981 and 1990. The picture is
similar in many of the former countries of the
communist bloc as a result of rapid pri vat i z at i o n .
All the same, higher education cannot be held
wholly responsible for gr a d u ate unemployment nor
for the corr e l ation that should exist between training,
The North-South g a p
In the last decade alone, the gap in
higher education enrolment rates has
widened by 6.7% in favour of the most
developed countries. A f r i c a , the region
with the highest annual increase in uni-
versity student numbers (7.5%), has a very
low enrolment rate (2.5%), while North
A m e r i c a , which has the lowest growth in
student numbers (1.6%) has the highest
enrolment rate (77.3%).
Perhaps the most marked disparities are
in student costs. A student in the North
costs far less in relation to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) than a student in the South.
In absolute terms, h o w e v e r, the latter costs
only $651, as opposed to $6,520 for the
f o r m e r.
On average, an investment by a poor
country of $651 in higher education
requires twice as big a sacrifice as an
investment of $6,520 by a rich country. I n
other words, the poorer the country, t h e
higher the relative cost per student and
the greater the national budgetary effort.

study programmes and
demand for labour. It is often
said that higher education is
failing to provide training in
the activities required by the
m a r k e t , but the market is often
incapable of adequately anti-
c i p ating the type of professio-
nals it is going to need.
A survey conducted in
F l o rida (USA) among mul-
t i n ationals in the high-tech
and services sectors revealed companies that
were unable to identify the professional qualities
t h at would be required within ten ye a rs and, i n
m a ny cases, within five ye a rs. This is not surp ri-
s i n g, in view of the spectacular rise of the Inter-
net between 1994 and 1998 which caught many
h a r d ware and software firms unawa r e s. It is in
i n f o rm ation technology that redundancies and
high unemployment levels are occurri n g, b e c a u s e
systems are constantly changing and because of
s t r at e gic mergers between the major companies.
Another example of the difficulty of making
reliable predictions concerns those made by the
European Community and the US Gove rn m e n t
regarding the types of jobs that would be needed at
the beginning of the new century.These predictions
were inaccurat e : w h at had been forecast to occur
after 2001 actually came about in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
It can be said,h owe ve r ,t h at professional training
over the coming ye a rs will focus on areas such as
high-tech electronics, i n f o rm ation technology,a q u a-
c u l t u r e ,a gr o - e n e r g y, biotechnology and energy phy-
s i c s. Jobs in inform ation and communication systems
will require new qualific ations which will have to
be continually updat e d .The service sector will expe-
rience spectacular gr owth in the field of leisure and
r e c r e ation because of the reduction in working hours.
New professions in the human sciences such as
“ l u d i c a d o l o g y ” , i n c o rp o r ating psychology, p e d a-
g o g y, i n f o rm ation science and the technology of
e d u c at i o n , p l ay and creativity progr a m m e s , w i l l
replace the old single-discipline approach.
In short , the gr e at occupational change looming
ahead will call for increased interdisciplinari t y, r e v i-
t a l i z ation of the disciplines related to ethics and aes-
thetics and sweeping changes in the attitudes of tea-
c h e rs and students: for the professional of the future,
education will be a lifelong process,and education
and work will go hand in hand.
The gr e at challenge will thus be to create a stable
relationship between higher education and society
Vision and action 
for the next century
Challenges await a World Conference on 
Higher Education in the 21st century,
convened by UNESCO in Paris from 5 to 9 October
Is world mobilization in favour of higher edu-
c ation justified while millions of adults and
children are illiterate and lack access to basic
e d u c ation? Is it reasonable to be concerned with
the development of unive rsities in regions where
p ove rt y, sickness and hunger are rife? T h e s e
questions need to be asked since organizat i o n s
such as the World Bank are urging deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries to invest in pri m a ry and secondary
e d u c ation on the grounds that they offer a better
r e t u rn and contri bute more to social equality
than higher educat i o n . UNESCO believe s , h owe-
ve r , t h at neglect of higher education could
d e p ri ve the countries of the South of an essential
tool for their development and for strengthening
their autonomy.
UNESCO has therefore decided to convene a
world conference on higher educat i o n .By doing so
it is inviting countries to regard higher educat i o n
not as a burden on state bu d g e t s , but as a long-term
investment that is beneficial to economic competi-
t i ve n e s s , cultural development and social cohesion,
as well as playing a major role in training pri m a ry and
secondary school teachers.
The World Bank and other institutions cast
doubt on the economic cost-effectiveness of uni-
ve rsities and their efficiency as vehicles of social
c h a n g e . This criticism is not totally unfounded.
The goal of the world conference is to put for-
ward substantial measures of unive rsity reform
(redefinition of their mission, o p e r ations and
funding) via action plans designed to enable
higher education to play a central role in
c o n t e m p o r a ry society.
The conference is the result of a long process
of intern ational consultation and refle x i o n . B e t-

through strat e gic alliances with the production sys-
tem designed to promote part i c i p ation by all sectors
of the economy in the unive rs i t y ’s basic and applied
research programmes and by production-sector spe-
cialists in university teaching.
The problems of the unive rsity are also those
of society, and so are the responsibilities. T h i s
raises the question of the unive rs i t y ’s specific cul-
t u r e , especially the teacher-student relat i o n s h i p.
Planning is currently based above all on the tea-
ching staff, which is more corp o r atist than aca-
d e m i c. P hysical spaces, s a l a ry scales, c u rri c u l a ,
s t ructures and timetables are more closely geared
to the needs of the teacher than of teaching.T h i s
is the case all over the wo r l d .
More serious still, this teacher-centred culture is
giving way to one that is even more dangerous for the
s u rv i val of unive rsity educat i o n : an administrat i o n -
centred culture.This would mean an education sys-
tem dominated by bu r e a u c r ats and the kind of mana-
gement structures which would place an institution
whose function is to produce and disseminate know-
ledge on the same footing as a detergent factory or
a multinational travel agency.
But no strategy for change can work unless
higher education adapts to the challenge of the
k n owledge explosion. It is vital that cours e
content should be geared to what learn e rs “ m u s t
k n ow ” and not to what teachers “ k n ow ” o r
“think they know ” .This will force teachers into a
p e rmanent renewal of theori e s , techniques and
p r o c e s s e s , keeping up with knowledge produced
both inside and outside the unive rs i t y. H i g h e r
e d u c ation is evolving towards a model in which
l e c t u r e rs and students will be permanent lear-
n e rs and where curricula will be drawn up on
the basis of innovat i o n , fresh knowledge and the
l atest teaching and learning technologi e s. A b ove
all the unive rsity must teach people to think, t o
use common sense and to gi ve free rein to the
c r e at i ve imagi n at i o n . ■

through concrete means, a “new unive rsity com-

higher learning and its critical and future-ori e n-

table to society. It opens for discussion questions
of funding and notes the importance of public

with the state including institutional autonomy
and academic freedom. Such a pact should help

The “ s u rv i vo rs ” of this rigorous selection

of a 35 per cent enrolment rate in higher educa-

Yet Turkish higher education has come a long
way since 1923, when the republic was proclai-

with 360,000 pupils and 12,000 teachers. We s-

eighteenth century, but education had remained
largely in the hands of clerical and Koranic ins-

open-minded and think for themselve s. I n d e e d

‘ Wanting to change
the university is like
trying to shake up a

José Ortega y Gasset,
Spain,1883-1955
   the future
oldest unive rs i t y, I s t a n bul Darülfünun, a bastion
of conservatism which shied away from the
s c i e n c e s , was turned into a modern secular insti-
tute of higher education in 1933 and renamed
I s t a n bul Unive rs i t y.
It openly welcomed Jewish academics fle e i n g
the Nazi exterm i n ation and completely transfor-
med itself. A t at ü r k ’s passion for science encou-
raged the founding of other unive rsities along the
same lines, notably the Istanbul Technical Uni-
ve rsity (ITU) in 1944 and the Unive rsity of
Ankara two ye a rs lat e r. The second big educa-
tional reform came in 1946, when unive rs i t i e s
won an independence which, despite poor wo r-
king conditions, made them the envy of many
u n i ve rsities in the We s t .Two other major reform s
f o l l owe d , in 1961 and 1981.
The number of unive rsities had meanwhile
gr own to twe n t y - s e ve n , each with its own sta-
tutes and way of operat i n g . This hasty and ill-
thought-out expansion caused many problems,
especially in harmonizing cours e s. The army
cited the chaotic situation in education to justify
its seizure of power in 1980 and
cut back unive rsity autonomy, c a u-
sing many lecturers to flee abroad.
The higher education law of 1981
i nvo l ved co-ordinating and stan-
dardizing the stru c t u r e s , duties and
responsibilities of all institutes of
higher education and linking them
to each other. All were to be at t a-
ched to unive rsities and a new
council for higher educat i o n
( YOK) was put in charge of plan-
ning and co-ordinating the reform s. The YO K
was ve ry controve rsial at the begi n n i n g, but it
still exists today, though with different powe rs
since the mid-1990s.
Some schools, k n own as “other educat i o n a l
i n s t i t u t i o n s ” , do not come under YOK bu t
va rious gove rnment ministri e s. For example, o n e
which teaches “health sciences” is attached to
the health ministry. Another teaches “ i n t e rn a l
s e c u rity serv i c e s ” i nvolving military colleges and
the police academy.
More and more higher education institutions
are spri n ging up, largely due to pri vat i z at i o n .T h e
f i rst pri vate unive rsities were founded in the
1960s but closed a decade later because of
p o o r l y - c o n s t ructed courses and degrees of little
va l u e . The 1981 reform law allowed only chari-
table foundations to set up pri vate unive rs i t i e s.
By 1988, 32 of the 33 existing unive rsities we r e
s t at e - ru n . To d ay there are 72 unive rs i t i e s , 18 of
them pri vat e l y - o p e r at e d . In Istanbu l , there are
six state unive rs i t i e s , but 12 pri vate ones.
The pri vate institutions, which generally have
a good reputat i o n , help the gove rnment avoid the
o u t flow of curr e n cy caused by a wholesale depar-
ture of young people to study abroad. They are
also a ray of light for hundreds of thousands of
high-school gr a d u ates who cannot get into stat e -
run unive rs i t i e s. The snag is that tuition fees are
ve ry high, e ven though the gove rnment subsi-
dizes up to 40 per cent of the cost for some stu-
d e n t s.
As well as being pri vat i z e d , higher educat i o n
has also been regi o n a l i z e d . In A t at ü r k ’s day, t h e
goal was to set up a secondary school in each
p r ov i n c e . The aim today is a unive rsity in each
o n e . This has produced many institutions whose
existence owes more to electoral politics than
academic considerat i o n s , along with abnorm a l i-
ties like faculties with only one teacher. G r a-
d u ates from these unive rsities find jobs, but not
the best ones.
The labour market is increasingly deman-
d i n g . Although education is divided up into four
s t a g e s – u n d e r gr a d u at e , gr a d u ate and masters
(each requiring from two to four ye a rs of study),
and then a doctorate–the only qua-
l i f i c ations employe rs are really
interested in are master’s degr e e s
or doctorat e s.
But the number of subjects on
offer at each stage is gr owing all
the time. More than a dozen new
d e gree courses were offered in
1997 alone and drew a large num-
ber of students, though this gi ve s
no real indication of whether the
c o u rses teach skills which enable
students to get jobs afterwa r d s. They may be
more of a fallback for students who failed to get
into the unive rsity of their choice because they
did not score well enough in the entry exam.
U n i ve rsity places are in demand, so exam results
d e t e rmine which students go where.
S p e c i a l i z ation and the proliferation of cours e s
are the broad trends. This is particularly true of
p ri vate courses at master’s leve l , where no fewe r
than 16 new subjects have been created in the
past academic ye a r , including wo m e n ’s studies,
r o b o t i c s , aerospace studies, s e i s m o l o g y, fa m i l y
medicine and gerontology.
At this rat e ,Turkey will have plenty of expert s
at the start of the new millennium. But there are
still big problems to sort out. More than two -
thirds of the country ’s 1,400,000 students are
m a l e , which is not surp rising since a fifth of Tu r-
kish women are illiterat e . A l s o, the average time
a Turk spends in school is still only betwe e n
three and six ye a rs. ■

30 The UNESCO Courier - September 1998
Since the Soviet collapse, the demand for
Russian courses in Bulgarian schools has
plummeted, leaving many teachers jobless
Bulgaria’s overdose
of Russian profs
In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Berlin wa l l
and communist regi m e s ,B u l g a rians could hardly
i m a gine what lay round the corn e r. A p a rt from
the need for economic reform , they had to face swe e-
ping changes in ways of thinking and learn i n g .“ We
had to rewrite all our textbooks, from pri m a ry school
to unive rsity leve l ,” s ays a history teacher at the uni-
ve rsity of Sofia .The first thing to be done was to
purge the national education system of the dead
weight of ideology and of compulsory Russian classes.
The history of Russian language teaching in Bul-
g a ria goes back to 1878, when the Czar’s arm i e s
freed the country from the Ottoman yo k e .As a token
of gr atitude to the “ l i b e r ating brothers ” from Russia,
it was decided that Russian would be taught in secon-
d a ry schools. Under the communist regi m e , R u s-
sian became compulsory in pri m a ry schools, a n d
was even taught in kindergart e n s.By the late 1980s,
c o u rses were being taught entirely in Russian in
t wenty secondary schools, and Bulgaria had 4,000
Russian teachers.
In 1992, the wind of democratic reform swe p t
through the education system. Marxism and com-
p u l s o ry Russian disappeared from
c u rri c u l a .But the decision was taken
without much thought for the conse-
q u e n c e s , especially for teachers.
School number 133 in Sofia,
where 1,300 students start learn i n g
Russian in the first year of the pri-
m a ry leve l , is the only holdover from
the old system. It receives so many
requests for admission that only one
in four applicants can be enrolled.“ We have sixteen
Russian teachers , but many colleagues had to be
r e t r a i n e d . I know of quite a few who went back to uni-
ve rsity to learn English or to become pri m a ry school
t e a c h e rs. O t h e rs left to sell books on the sidewa l k ,”
explains the pri n c i p a l ,L y u b ov Micheva .
Two thousand Russian teachers found them-
s e l ves without a job after the reform , s ays Letelina
K ru m ova ,a specialist on the issue at the ministry of
e d u c at i o n . In 1993 she started a programme to
retrain “ h i g h - risk gr o u p s ” , including jobless Rus-
sian teachers. “But the amount of money required
t u rned out to be exorbitant, so we soon gave up on
the idea and asked the people concerned to manage
on their ow n ,” s ays Kru m ova . At the unive rsity of
S o fia ,a sound two - year cur-
riculum has neve rt h e l e s s
helped many of them earn
an English teaching degr e e .
One expert say s ,“in the end
it was the right choice,
because nowa d ays the Rus-
sian-English combinat i o n
is one of the most highly sought-after.”
T h at was then. Four ye a rs ago the Bulgari a n
Socialist party was voted back into power and the
retraining courses were abolished.The succeeding
g ove rn m e n t , which has been in power for a ye a r ,i s
h aving a hard time managing a cumbersome legacy.
Hostages to the education system reform ,w h i c h
itself has been buffeted by political squabbles and
c h a n ging gove rn m e n t s ,m a ny teachers have left tea-
ching altogether for business careers.
S vetla Djivreteva has started raising silkwo rm s.
“It wa s n ’t exactly my calling in life,” she say s ,“ but I
had to make a living somehow.”A gr a d u ate of the uni-
ve rsity of Veliko Ta rn ovo near her home village of
D r a g a n ovo in Bulgari a ’s heart l a n d , she started out
studying to be a Russian teacher. B u t
by the time she finished the reform s
had been implemented. S vetla deci-
ded to follow her husband to Ruse, a
t own near the nort h e rn border,but fa i-
led to find a job there. “I had to teach
B u l g a rian literature in a village twe n t y -
five kilometres from home,” she say s.“ I
got up at five - t h i rty in the morning to
c atch the bu s. In winter there wa s n ’t
a ny wood to heat the school and the children tried to
w rite with their gloves on.”
After a ye a r ,S vetla was sacked and replaced by
a friend of the pri n c i p a l . She moved back into her
p a r e n t s ’home near her alma mat e r , where she enrol-
led on a pri m a ry school teacher training cours e .W i t h
her new diploma in her pocket, she is currently unem-
p l oyed but has her eye on a job in the village school.
In the meantime, S vetla surv i ves by going each
month to the nearby silk mill where she is gi ven a large
jar of silkwo rm s.This thankless job brings in 100,000
l e va (slightly over $50) a month. She wants to go
back to teaching, but in the meantime all she can do
is wait and raise wo rm s. ■

Business follows gr a d u at e s. For the coun-
t ries that host them, t o d ay ’s high-flying
foreign students hold the keys to tomor-
r ow ’s successful deals, because when they return
home they will probably become influential deci-
sion makers in politics and bu s i n e s s.
M e a n w h i l e , they provide the countries where
they study with hefty tuition and lodging fees.
According to the non-gove rnmental organizat i o n
E d u c ation Intern ational (EI), each year foreign
students bring in $7 billion to the US economy,
b e t ween $1.7 and $2 billion to the United King-
d o m , $750 million to Australia and $730 million
to Canada. “In A u s t r a l i a , the Royal Melbourn e
Institute of Technology and Monash Unive rs i t y
are considered among the top 500 service expor-
t e rs.”
1.5 million 
students abro a d
I n t e rn ational student flows have increased at the
same pace as worldwide demand for higher edu-
c ation in the past few ye a rs. In 1980, a p p r ox i-
m ately 900,000 young people left home to study
a b r o a d . To d ay the figure is 1.5 million, a n d ,
e x p e rts say, the upward trend is likely to conti-
n u e . N i n e t y - f i ve per cent of students studying
outside their home countries head for the indus-
t rially developed nat i o n s.T h r e e - q u a rt e rs of them
go to eight countri e s , and the trend is mov i n g
t owards still gr e ater concentrat i o n . By far the
most popular destination is the United Stat e s ,
where the number of foreign students has increa-
sed almost six-fold in thirty ye a rs , rising from
82,000 in 1964-65 to 458,000 in 1996-97. “ I t ’s
n e ver been so high,” although the number has
flattened out in the past five ye a rs , s ays Todd M.
D av i s , director of research at the Institute of
I n t e rn ational Education (IIE) in New Yo r k .T h e
figures may be impressive , but foreign students
account for only 3.2 per cent of the total in the
United States–three times less than in Germ a ny,
France and the United Kingdom.
The second most frequented host country is
F r a n c e , with 140,000 foreign students in 1996.
Although France has a strong, long-standing tradi-
tion of welcoming foreigners , its market share is
dropping, according to a 1996 study by SFERE, a
French organization which monitors the export of
e d u c ational resources. In Germ a ny,A u s t r a l i a , Ja p a n
and the United Kingdom,on the other hand, f o r e i g n
student enrolment has increased.
A f rica south of the Sahara and a number of A s i a n
countries send the highest proportion of their stu-
dent populations abroad: over 10 per cent. In term s
of numbers,however, China is the biggest “expor-
t e r ” , with 130,000 expat ri ate students, twice as
m a ny as Japan and the Republic of Korea, w h i c h
come next.Young people from Asia account for
nearly half of all students abroad.
Why do more and more young people, usually
acting on advice from their fa m i l i e s , decide to study
outside their home countries? First of all,because
rightly (the usual case) or wrongly (sometimes for
snobbish reasons), they believe that the quality of
higher education is better abroad. O t h e r , more spe-
c i fic fa c t o rs may also come into play. F l ows bet-
ween European countries account for a quarter of
worldwide student flow s. They are part of a gr o-
wing trend and a political movement towards regi o-
nal integr ation which are reflected in unive rsity stu-
dent exchange programmes such as the European
U n i o n ’s Erasmus scheme. In other parts of the
world, restrictive measures encourage some com-
munities to look elsewhere.For example,“the Malay-
sian government has quotas on the number of eth-

nic Chinese allowed in its unive rs i t i e s ,” e x p l a i n s
R o b e rt Law r e n c e , director of LD & A , an A u s t r a l i a n
company which carried out a survey on Asian stu-
dent movements in 1997. In poor countri e s ,c a n d i-
d ates for emigr ation regard the unive rsity as an open
door to an Eldorado in the West.Everywhere, the
brightest hopefuls apply to elite institutions which
h ave fiercely competitive selection procedures, s u c h
as Yale,Harvard and Columbia on the east coast of
the United States, Stanford and Berkeley in Cali-
f o rn i a ,Oxford and Cambridge in England, the Ecole
Polytechnique and the School of Advanced Com-
mercial Studies (HEC) in France,and McGill Uni-
versity in Canada.
A m e rican unive rsities are a powerful magnet
for several reasons, including the use of English
as a world language, the persistence of the A m e-
rican dream and, a b ove all, quality of educat i o n .
“ T h at ’s where you find the most four-star pro-
gr a m m e s ,” s ays Denis Lévy, h o n o r a ry president
of the Intern ational A s s o c i ation of Unive rs i t y
P r o f e s s o rs and Lecturers. “ For example, S t a n-
ford is the best place to study European law.
Schools like that have unlimited mat e ri a l
r e s o u r c e s. They subscribe to eve ry t h i n g, use the
l atest inform ation technology to the full and offer
outstanding working conditions.” U n i ve rsities in
the developing countries cannot measure up.
Often ill-equipped or transformed into bat t l e-
grounds during political confli c t s , they are deser-
ted by the best teachers.
Young people believe that studying abroad is
almost always a passport to employ m e n t .“ T h at ’s
especially true when the recruiter has also stu-
died outside his or her country. When he or she
p e r c e i ves the intern ational student as equal to
the domestic one, the ove rseas degree still makes
the applicant stand out,” s ays Law r e n c e . Fa m i-
l i e s , which usually foot the bill for their children’s
e d u c at i o n , do not hesitate to make the inve s t-
m e n t . In the English-speaking wo r l d , tuition fees
can run as high as $27,000 in the United Stat e s
and $15,000 in the United Kingdom. Unlike the
s i t u ation in European countries such as France,
where access to most institutions of higher lear-
ning is inexpensive , the poorest applicants are
a u t o m atically screened out on financial gr o u n d s.
They have access only if they are outstanding, i n
which case they obtain grants and scholars h i p s
from their gove rn m e n t s , from intern ational orga-
n i z ations and pri vate foundat i o n s.
A valuable export
The outflow of students is a serious loss for the
“ e x p o rt i n g ” c o u n t ri e s. According to UNESCO,
30,000 A f rican gr a d u at e s , as well as many A s i a n
and Latin A m e rican ones, m ay have settled outside
their home continents. Among the reasons which
make them hesitate to return home are their fears of
s aying goodbye to a high standard of living in the host
c o u n t ry (including access to health care, q u a l i t y
education for their children and high salaries) and
of running into a professional dead-end at home.
“The conditions of scientific work are difficult in
d e veloping countri e s ,” s ay Jacques and A n n e - M a ri e
Gaillard of France’s ORSTOM research centre.
“The research is not ori gi n a l , bu r e a u c r atic controls
put a brake on initiat i ve ,equipment is hard to acquire
and maintain,access to information is limited. . . .”
There may also be political obstacles. In the lat e
1980s, China began to realize that expatriate stu-
dents were not return i n g . Despite measures to lure
young graduates back home,such as the allocation
of housing and research budgets and the freedom to
travel, between 1978 and 1994 only 70,000 out of
A s i a n s in demand
Most expatriate students are from
Asian countries. In spite of the crisis,
they are also the most sought-after.
Europe and North America are vying to
attract them but Canada and, e s p e c i a l l y,
the United States win the competition
hands down. A 1997 study by A u s t r a l i a ’s
LD & A company shows that 88% of A s i a n
students believe the US offers the best
educational services, followed by the UK.
In non-English-speaking Europe, t h e y
regard the quality of the German system
as higher than that of the Fr e n c h . A c c o r-
ding to the Institute of International Edu-
cation (USA), Asia provides 57% of all
foreign students in the US, ahead of
Europe (15%) and Latin America (11%).
Most are from Japan (45,531), followed by
China (42,503), the Republic of Ko r e a
( 3 7 , 1 3 0 ) , India (30,641) and Ta i wa n
( 3 0 , 4 8 7 ) . Business is the Asians’ favourite

s c i e n c e s. ■

230,000 students who had left China to study abroad
returned,according to official figures.
The example of the Republic of Korea show s
t h at an authori t a rian regime is no obstacle if the
e c o n o my is thri v i n g . In the early 1960s, m a ny
Koreans remained abroad after graduation,80 per
cent of them in the United Stat e s.But in the 1980s,
t wo-thirds of those who had earned doctorates from
A m e rican unive rsities went back home within three
ye a rs of receiving their degr e e s.Generally speaking,
the “little dragons” of southeast Asia boast the
highest percentages of returning students–at least
until the recent economic crisis blew up.
Whether they return home or not,foreign stu -
dents are a profitable investment for the host coun-
t ry. When they become decision makers in their
home countries,they control access to markets. If
they settle down where they studied, they often pro-
vide energy and fresh ideas.
T h at lesson has not been lost on the United
States,where the Immigration and Nationality Act
A m e n d m e n t ,which entered into force in 1968, fa c i-
litates the immigration of qualified personnel and
where several foundations offer grants to the most
promising students.To d ay, p ri vate companies eve n
pay some foreign students’tuition fees to make up
for the shortage of skilled pers o n n e l , especially in the
field of information technology. Most of the scien-
tists living in the United States were born abroad and
over one-third of Silicon Va l l e y ’s engi n e e rs and
r e s e a r c h e rs are immigrants from Ta i wa n ,s ay Ja c q u e s
and Anne-Marie Gaillard.
But Australia probably has the most aggr e s-
s i ve policy for attracting foreign students, e s p e-
cially A s i a n s. It has opened inform ation offices in
some forty countries and makes it easy for
foreign students to obtain a visa. According to
E I , Canada and the United Kingdom have done
the same. Ja p a n ’s ministry of education has deci-
ded to accept 100,000 foreign students by 2000,
but in 1996 such students only numbered
52,000 and numbers may fa l l , according to A k i r a
N i n o m i ya , a professor at the unive rsity of Hiro-
s h i m a . Reasons include the high cost of living in
Ja p a n , the language barri e r , the rigorous admis-
sions process and the near-impossibility for forei-
g n e rs of finding work on the local market.
For host countries,
a profitable import
France has a ve ry ambiguous policy.According to a
recent study,“the current paradox consists of a drop
in the percentage of foreign students and gr owing dif-
ficulties in hosting them and, at the same time, a
desire to be more present on the intern ational edu-
c ation market.”The French are uneasy about the
structure of the foreign student population,which
r e flects their country ’s history. O ver half come from
former colonies in Africa, countries with “limited
economic potential,” according to SFERE.But the
French are also aware that they cannot afford to
give up too much ground on the international stu-
dent market, especially in a world where, a c c o r d i n g
to EI, “ e m p l oye rs seek qualified employees who
t h ri ve in foreign environments and understand mul-
ticultural contexts.” ■
Sophie Boukhari
Without by-passing their own depart m e n t s
of human resources, big companies are
increasingly recruiting employe e s
through intern ational head-hunting agencies.
Lafarge,a French multinational specializing in the
m a n u facture of construction mat e ri a l s , spent months
looking for an engineer to supervise quality control,
the organization and management of laborat o ry
staff and customer relations for its Cameroonian
s u b s i d i a ry. E ventually it contacted A f ri c S e a r c h ,
which specializes in spotting talented A f ricans trai-
ned in the West and putting them in touch with firm s
established in Africa.
One of their recent recruits is a young Came-
r o o n i a n , G a b riel Bekemen, was hired in Pa ri s
just after gr a d u at i n g . To d ay he is a quality-
control engineer in a laborat o ry in the tow n
where he was born . “I studied engi n e e ring in
Pa ris at the Ecole Po l y t e c h n i q u e ,” he say s. “ T h e n
I did a master’s degree in quality-control mana-
gement at the Centre for Higher Industrial Stu-
d i e s , and later obtained a diploma in finance at
the National A rts and Crafts Centre. I answe r e d
a press adve rtisement and shortly afterwards wa s
contacted by A f ri c S e a r c h , where I was selected
from among twenty other candidates after a
number of tests and interv i e w s. I think that what
most helped me to get the job was the fact that I
had worked to pay my way while I was a stu-
d e n t .”

tions that are unavailable locally, they look elsew-
h e r e ,” explains Je a n - P i e rre Kwe d i , a consultant
and partner at A f ri c S e a r c h . “They are looking
for sound training as provided by the unive rs i t i e s
and higher education institutes, but they also
want candidates to ori gi n ate from the country in
question or at least be A f ri c a n , since they will
adapt more easily to a social, economic and cul-
tural context which they know we l l .”
Diplomas aren’t everything
For other companies, n ationality or experi e n c e
make little difference. Guido Tommei is respon-
sible for staff recruitment for A f rica at Schlum-
b e r g e r , a multinational company which offers
s e rvices and know h ow to major oil companies.
“ We pri m a rily recruit recent young gr a d u at e s ,”
he say s , “regardless of nationality and or expe-
ri e n c e , who are prepared to work in tough condi-
tions and adapt to different situat i o n s.”
Pascal Devoulon of Alexandre T i c, a French
e m p l oyment agency which forms par t of an
i n t e rn ational netwo r k , sets a high pri o rity on per-
sonal initiat i ve . “Unsolicited job applicat i o n s
r e c e i ve more attention than many people think,”
he say s. “In our company we place such applica-
tions on file and summon candidates when we
r e c e i ve a request that matches their qualifica-
t i o n s.”
Besides the usual methods like press adve rt i-
s e m e n t s , unsolicited applications and contact
over the Intern e t , m a ny firms find that trainee-
ships for students or recent gr a d u ates are the
best way of getting to know an individual’s abili-
t i e s. If trainees’ p r o files match the firm ’s requi-
r e m e n t s , they are hired more or less on the spot.
This explains why big firms are tending to
make exchange agreements with unive rsities and
other higher education institutions. P h i l i p s , a
Dutch multinational with 250,000 staff spread
out over five continents, takes on 20,000 new
e m p l oyees eve ry ye a r. Of these, 20 per cent are
young gr a d u ates who will work mainly in
r e s e a r c h , technical deve l o p m e n t , i n f o rm at i o n
technology or electronics and product marketing
and sales. “ M a ny of our staff come from the trai-
ning forums and programmes we organize with
leading unive rsities in all world regions where we
do bu s i n e s s , for example IMD Unive rsity in
S w i t z e r l a n d , the London Business School in Bri-
t a i n , Supelec in France and the Rotterdam
School of A d vanced Studies in the Netherlands,”
explains Yan Lave n a n , P h i l i p s ’ General Manager
for Human Resources.
But diplomas aren’t eve ry t h i n g . C h a r l e s -
H e n ri Dumond, president of Michel Pa g e , a lea-

t h at initial experience is extremely important in

is ve ry import a n t ,” he say s , “ but so is general
b a c k gr o u n d . Technical skills or diplomas from
p r e s t i gious schools have their place but we also
take into account the candidat e ’s pers o n a l i t y,
a d a p t a b i l i t y, k n owledge of languages and wo r k

It is a familiar sight to the residents of Madras
and other big Indian cities. Oblivious of the
scorching sun, scores of young people stand
in long queues outside the United States consu-
l ate waiting for their turn to be interv i e we d .
M a ny of them are students wishing to go to their
dreamland for higher studies, if possible for a
b right future too. While some of them manage
to get visas, o t h e rs fail to convince the consulat e
o f f i c i a l s.
Three decades ago it was regarded as an
exceptional achievement for an Indian to study
a b r o a d . To d ay, the phenomenon is much more
widespread and hundreds of students leave India
looking for higher qualific ations and greener pas-
tures in North A m e rica and in Europe. “ E ve ry
year the US consulates in India gi ve visas to
nearly 1,500 students to pursue higher studies
in A m e rican unive rs i t i e s ,” s ays an official at the
United States Embassy in New Delhi.
Though India has more than 260 unive rs i-
t i e s , c o m p rising nearly 8,200 colleges, it has
often been claimed that the standard of higher
e d u c ation has not kept pace with change. “ T h e r e
is no point in doing research in India. The lack of
u p - t o - d ate facilities and funding forces students
to come to the United Stat e s ,” s ays V i rul A c h a-
rya , a researcher at New York Unive rs i t y. A c a d e-
mics point out that the educational system in
India was set up during the British era and only
minor changes have been made to it since then.
M o r e ove r , in the post-independence peri o d ,
emphasis was laid on the humanities at the
expense of other disciplines. E d u c ational institu-
t i o n s , most of them stat e - a i d e d , suffered heav i l y
from federal budget cutbacks over the ye a rs , a n d
India’s loss, West’s gain
For many in India, a diploma from the North represents a
passport to financial and social success

according to A c h a rya there has been complete
s t a g n ation in higher research since the 1970s.
“Most Indian colleges do not even have the
I n t e rn e t ,” he say s.
Helped by their predecessors , Indian students
carefully select which institution to apply to, for a
place in a reputed college or unive rsity assures
them of a lucrat i ve job after their cours e . M a ny of
them are recruited at campus interviews conduc-
ted by multinational companies. For those who
decide to return home, a well-paid job could be
hard to fin d , as few companies in India offer high
s a l a ri e s. “I came here to do my studies in com-
p u t e rs and I got a job the day after the cours e
was ove r ,” s ays Raj Lokaiya n , a computer-profes-
sional turned businessman living in New Yo r k .“ I
am sure in India I would have had to wait for
m o n t h s , m aybe ye a rs , to find a suitable job.”
A golden highway 
to Silicon Valley
Whereas in the early 1970s large numbers of
Indian students went to the United States to
study medicine, the most popular subject today
is inform ation technology, f o l l owed by bu s i n e s s
a d m i n i s t r at i o n . According to India A b r o a d, a n
ethnic Indian weekly published in the United
S t at e s , there are nearly 35,000 Indian computer
professionals in Californ i a ’s Silicon Valley alone.
“Some of them have started their own companies
and are doing ve ry we l l ,” s ays Niraj Tri ve d i , a
j o u rnalist working with the magazine.
Indian students who go to the US and
Europe are not necessarily ri c h . Most hail from
middle-class fa m i l i e s , which seek higher social
s t atus by sending their children abroad. It is
impossible for a middle-income group fa m i l y
with a yearly income of $3,600 to send their chil-
dren abroad for studies which cost at least
$5,000 a ye a r. H e r e , the low-interest educat i o n a l
loans (up to $15,000) offered by Indian banks
come in handy. Studies in India cost ve ry little,
since most of the institutions are gove rn m e n t -
f u n d e d , causing some to denounce the brain
drain caused when students use the nat i o n ’s
resources for their initial studies and then
m i gr ate to other countries lat e r.
In the past, B ritish unive rsities at t r a c t e d
m a ny Indian students because of historical links
b e t ween the two countri e s. A m e rican unive rs i-
ties took over in the early 1970s following a dras-
tic cut in the number of scholarships in Bri t a i n .
They were the obvious altern at i ve because of the
language and the higher level of educat i o n . A l l
the same, a 1997 UNESCO study noted that
India only ranked seventh among the countri e s
sending students abroad, well behind such smal-
ler countries as the Republic of Korea and
M a l ay s i a .
Indian students wishing to study abroad fa c e
m a ny hurdles since visa restrictions have been
tightened by the US and Europe since the early
1 9 9 0 s. Some of them opt for less expensive uni-
ve rsities in Australia or Russia. “The number of
students coming to the US has dropped in the
last few ye a rs ,” s ays V i rul A c h a rya . “ H owe ve r , i f
they want higher qualific ations they have to come
to the US or Europe as Indian unive rsities lag
far behind.” ■

‘ The essential thing in
teaching is to teach
what it is to know.’
Simone Weil,1909-1943,
France.
A t the end of the academic year in June 1998,
some 4,000 people with postgr a d u at e
d e grees and 18,000 other unive rsity gr a-
duates arrived on Morocco’s labour market.Many
of them are likely to join the 200,000 graduates of
institutions of higher learning who are already loo-
king for work and have beleaguered every govern-
ment in Rabat since the early 1990s.
The problem actually dates back to
the eighties.The structural adjustment
p r o gramme implemented then at the
urging of international financial ins-
titutions helped restore financial sta-
b i l i t y, but at the cost of severe belt-
tightening measures by the state.
The result has been that the num-
ber of gove rn m e n t - c r e ated jobs has
plummeted from 28,000 a year in the
early 1980s to 12,000 a year in the
past decade.The pri vate sector, w h i c h
e m p l oys 90 per cent of Morocco’s
wo r k f o r c e , c r e ates only 100,000 to
200,000 jobs a year,while the unem-
p l oyment rate stands at 18 per cent,according to offi-
cial figures.
As early as 1990, the casualties of budget cut-
backs began fighting back.In 1991 they decided to
put pressure on the authorities by forming an Unem-
p l oyed Unive rsity Graduat e s ’ A s s o c i at i o n , w h i c h
n ow has 120 branches throughout the country.
Jobless unive rsity gr a d u ates know how to make their
voices heard better than other unemployed people,
and the response was not long in coming.The King
of Morocco set up a National Council of Youth and
the Future (CNJA), on which all the country ’s eco-
nomic players are represented, and asked the new
body to find solutions to the thorny problem. I n
1993 the council’s diagnosis of the situation led to
the passage of a law that exempts companies from
p aying employe rs ’ social security contri butions if
they hire gr a d u ates as trainees at a modest salary
r a n ging from 1,600 to 2,600 dirhams ($166 to
$ 2 7 0 ) . In 1994, a job promotion fund was set up
to help young graduates start their own companies
and obtain loans.
These measures were unsuccessful, so a
“ youth training and employ m e n t ” p r o gr a m m e
was set up in October 1997. The goal is to place
20,000 recent unive rsity gr a d u ates in pri vat e
companies eve ry ye a r. The firms that hire them
are entitled to all the advantages granted by the
l aws of 1993 and 1994, and in addition, half the
s a l a ries paid to the new recruits are reimbu rs e d .
The programme has a 1,710-million-dirham
($176-million) budget spread out over four ye a rs.
F u rt h e rm o r e , ten “job inform ation and ori e n t a-
tion centres” h ave opened where employe rs and
p r o s p e c t i ve employe rs can meet, and soon there
will be twice as many. But in 1997 they helped
only a thousand or so gr a d u ates find wo r k .
None of these measures has solved the problem.
Is it because liberal arts and law school graduates
account for 60 to 70 per cent of the associat i o n ’s
m e m b e rship while science gr a d u at e s
make up only 20 per cent? In any
c a s e , jobless gr a d u ates were on the
m ove again when a new gove rn m e n t
was formed in May 1998. D u ring his
f i rst television appearance, t h e
g ove rnment spokesman and minis-
ter of employment announced that
the new team’s priority was to bring
d own unemploy m e n t , and that his
d e p a rtment alone was going to creat e
187 jobs. Much to his surp ri s e ,
u n e m p l oyed gr a d u ates immediat e l y
held a sit-in in front of his ministry’s
headquarters. Since then,they have
besieged the employment and fin a n c e
m i n i s t ry by turn s , while jobless agronomists have tur-
ned their attention to the agriculture ministry.
U n e m p l oyed gr a d u ates also blocked the gates of
parliament while the deputies inside discussed the
1999 finance law.
The gove rnment is counting on economic reco-
ve ry to settle the problem, at least part i a l l y. In theory,
each additional point of growth represents 20,000
new jobs,so graduates still have reason to hope. ■

September 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 37
◗ Is there really a crisis in higher education?
I dislike the word “ c ri s i s ” . Although the pro-
blems differ from country to country, h i g h e r
e d u c ation all over the world is going through a
p e riod characterized by the gr owth of the stu-
dent populat i o n , an increase in unit costs, a n d
the difficulty of gearing courses to the gr a d u at e s ’
need to find jobs that match their training. T h e
entire world is facing a hard choice between pure
market logi c, where unive rsities would compete
with each other like bu s i n e s s e s , and the curr e n t
system dominated by the public unive rs i t y
bu r e a u c r a cy. L a s t l y, the planetary deve l o p m e n t
of the unive rsity system has not reduced inequa-
lities as it was supposed to do, but has actually
helped to exacerbate them.
◗ In what way?
There are two mechanisms at work that attract the
best students,regardless of their nationality, to the
best unive rs i t i e s ,p ri m a rily A m e rican ones. Not only
will the elites of the South continue streaming to
the countries of the Nort h , especially English-spea-
king ones,but unive rsites are going to create “ n o m a d
c a m p u s e s ” in the client countri e s. Like companies,
brands such as Harvard and Stanford will be expor-
ted with their standards of quality to Singapore and
New Delhi. Because of this pri vat i z at i o n , we will
no longer be able to speak of the North as such, bu t
of autonomous unive rsity systems. H a rvard and
Oxford will lend their labels to the unive rsities of
the South.The major universities will function like
vacuum pumps,sucking up the best students.
◗ Is this trend unavoidable?
It must be resisted by creating transnational ins-
titutions capable of combating the introduction
of market logic into higher educat i o n . The pri c e
to pay for that is the setting up of mechanisms to
monitor the quality of public serv i c e . Public uni-
ve rsities must agree to submit to assessments
made by outside bodies. Europe should set up
an assessment agency that would make unive rs i-
ties permanently open to scru t i ny and have them
sanctioned if they do not comply with the stan-
dards set for them.
◗ What criteria would those assessments be
based on? Should the aim of higher education
be to train producers or citizens?
It has to do both, of course.The ties between uni-
ve rsities and business must be strengthened so that
companies more readily agree to accept training
p r o grammes that lead to diplomas. At the same
t i m e , e ve ry unive rsity gr a d u ate should have lear-
ned at least four things there:h ow to be a good citi-
zen,how to communicate,create and criticize.In a
country like France, there is still room for impro-
vement in that regard. E d u c ation does not stress
the importance of those four concepts enough.C o m-
m u n i c ating means knowing how to use a computer,
but it also means knowing how to speak at least two
foreign languages,which is rare.The skills needed for
critical discussion are also far from widespread.
◗ What does it mean to be a citizen?
F i rst of all, it means knowing the law, o n e ’s
duties and one’s ri g h t s. But it also means lear-
ning how to live in society, to make decisions, t o
p a rt i c i p at e . Student life itself should be a firs t -
hand experience in learning about democracy.
◗ Your comments suggest that democracy is
having rather a rough time worldwide, with
inequalities increasing. But is higher education
becoming more democratic in the wealthy
countries?
It is becoming a mass phenomenon without
becoming more democrat i c. In the rich countri e s
there is what might be called “cultural insider
d e a l i n g ” .This means that children whose parents
are unive rsity gr a d u ates not only possess what
the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu calls “ c u l-
tural capital”, but have another essential adva n-
tage as we l l : access to networks enabling them
to find out how to acquire the best educat i o n .
This phenomenon is wo rsening in societies that
are increasingly fragmented into communities
living side by side but cut off from each other.
To d ay only a small number of people have access
to genuine higher educat i o n . In many parts of
the world we are witnessing a lengthening of the
p ri m a ry education period and the virtual disap-
pearance of secondary educat i o n ; p ri m a ry and
higher education meet up with each other. A n d
higher education is splitting in two : “ l owe r
h i g h e r ” e d u c at i o n , available to eve ryo n e , g o e s
more or less from the last ye a rs of high school to
the master’s degr e e . Access to true higher edu-
c at i o n – p o s t gr a d u ate studies–requires member-
ship of certain social and cultural circles. T h at is
h ow inequalities persist behind a semblance of
d e m o c r a cy. ■

A skull rotates on the black screen.
The picture of a baby flanked by
H i t l e r ’s moustache or a photo-
montage of A rnold Schwarzenegger wiel-
ding a sword with Ingrid Bergman at his
f e e t , both of them naked, file past. T h i s
s o rt of thing may amuse some people,
but it is no laughing matter when sites
on bomb-making, child prostitution and
the superi o rity of the white race appear.
The Intern e t , the outcome of a successful
m a rriage between telecommunicat i o n s
and inform ation technology, is posing
unprecedented inform ation control pro-
blems which gove rn m e n t s , s e rvice prov i-
d e rs , e d u c at o rs and families are fin d i n g
hard to solve .
Messages travel without
leaving a tra c e
A newspaper has an editorial team and a
p rinting plant, a television network has
n e w s c a s t e rs , studios and transmitters. I n
other wo r d s , traditional media are identi-
fiable and have a physical or mat e ri a l
component that the authorities can call
to account when they consider that the
l aw has been broken.They can prosecute
a journ a l i s t , shut down a newspaper or
c o n fis c ate a transmitter. The media are
also attached to a terri t o ry. Their mes-
sages may cross borders , but their activi-
ties come under the jurisdiction of at
least one country.
The Internet is another matter alto-
g e t h e r. F i rst of all, there are countless
t r a n s m i t t e rs of inform at i o n . A hundred
million people have access to the Inter-
n e t , and any one of them can not only
send electronic mail and take part in chat
f o rums bu t , with a little electronic tinke-
ri n g, t u rn their personal computer into a
s e rvice provider that others can tap into.
In a way, t h at person then becomes “ v i r-
t u a l ” . His or her message can travel along
so many routes that when it reaches its
d e s t i n at i o n , the ori ginal source can no
longer be traced.
L e gi t i m ate or not, the monitoring of
contents must take this new situation into
a c c o u n t .T h at would require a unive rs a l
a greement based on a common set of ethics,
or at least a lowest common denominator.
But that is far from the case.The Nether-
l a n d s , C h i n a , Z a m b i a , the United Stat e s ,
Cuba and France, to name just a few coun-
tries,have radically different and even irre-
concilable views on what is and what is not
permissible on the Internet.
I n t e rnet service prov i d e rs and some
o r g a n i z ations campaigning to “clean up
the We b ” point to an assault on morality.
The fierce competition among serv i c e
p r ov i d e rs has led many of them to culti-
vate a wholesome image on issues such
as paedophilia, which strikes a chord in
public opinion, out of fear of being consi-
dered purve yo rs of “ s m u t ” .
In The Netherlands, the authorities have
no intention of passing repressive law s. I n s-
tead they are encouraging service prov i d e rs
to clean up their act by eliminating paedo-
phile and racist sites from their servers. In
January 1996 Dutch Internet service pro-
v i d e rs created a foundation in charge of
tracking down undesirable sites. L aw enfor-
cement officials step in only when the author
of the incriminating pages refuses to com-
p l y.But Renee Zwa rt , a member of the foun-
d ation who believes censorship is a “ m e d i e-
val instru m e n t ” ,s ays her organization does
not attack freedom of expression.
M a ny companies supply their clients
with tools to screen out porn o gr a p h i c
and racist sites. S e veral such progr a m s
are on the market, including Cyber

Will censorship on the Internet forbid the unacceptable or just silence
troublesome voices? What grip can be held on a communications tool
designed to be free from control?
How can we prevent children from accessing violent sites, without restricting freedom of expression?

Pat r o l , C Y B E R s i t t e r , N e t N a n ny and
S u r f wat c h . They offer a list of we b s i t e s
or forums with a reputation for contai-
ning mat e rial considered offensive and a
list of key words that are judged obscene.
The connexion is interrupted wheneve r
a user tries to log on to one of these sites
or as soon as a forbidden word appears
on screen.The Electronic Frontier Fo u n-
d at i o n , an A m e rican organization dedi-
c ated to a radical defence of freedom of
speech on the Intern e t , is totally in line
with its country ’s laws and tradition.T h e
f o u n d ation argues that although these
p r o grams screen out indecent content,
they also block access to many political
and social sites, including pages devo t e d
to fighting Aids and promoting wo m e n ’s
ri g h t s.The experiment is “ i n c o n c l u s i ve ” .
M o r e ove r , “it is relat i vely easy to outs-
m a rt these progr a m s , e ven for a begi n-
n e r ,” s ays Je a n - Paul Cloutier, an inde-
pendent World Wide Web pioneer in
Quebec and editor of Chroniques de Cybé-
ri e, an on-line inform ation and commen-
t a ry magazine about the inform at i o n
h i g h way s.
G ove rnment restrictions can be enforced
in the name of morality, but above all they
are used to prevent the use of the Internet for
“subversive” ends. In China, for example,
I n t e rnet users must register with the police
and agree not to use the medium for “anti-
g ove rnment activities”. W h at ’s more, t h e
g ove rn m e n t , which has eve ry modem-ow n e r
on fil e , has monitored all traffic since 1996.
“For example,it is now against the law for
a businessman to use the Internet to obtain
stock market information considered stra-
t e gi c,” s ays Christophe Tr o n c h e , a member
of the French section of Citadel, an organi-
zation that campaigns for the upholding of
individual freedom on the Intern e t . In Cuba,
the regulation commis-
s i o n , which approve s
requests for Intern e t
access, is entirely made
up of representatives of
the justice, interior and
a rmed forces ministri e s.
In countries like
China and Cuba,m o n i-
t o ring cy b e rspace is
easier because “the tele-
c o m m u n i c ations opera-
t o rs belong to the stat e ,” Cloutier explains.
But monitoring is less straightforward when
the site is offered by a server located out-
side the country. T h at is the case, f o r
e x a m p l e , in A l g e ri a , where Internet users
have access to a site created by “dissident
o f f i c e rs ” in the armed forces. “The A l g e-
rian gove rnment doesn’t like our site’s
content. . . .We use the Web as an opportu-
n i t y,” s ays the site’s anonymous we b m a s-
ter.
The Internet can be used as an alter-
n at i ve to censored traditional media,
especially the printed wo r d . In Nove m-
ber 1997 the French organization Repor-
t e rs without Frontiers , which defends
freedom of the press, t ried using the
I n t e rnet to gi ve a new lease of life to the
M a u ritanian newspaper M a u ritanie Nou-
ve l l e, whose publication had been sus-
pended for seven months, by putting
some of the publicat i o n ’s articles on line.
To d ay, opponents of monolithic regi m e s
can use the Internet to set up areas of
freedom that are forbidden in their ow n
c o u n t ries and can reach an intern at i o n a l
audience that would be difficult to obtain
o t h e r w i s e . C e n s o rs around the world are
coming up against this phenomenon
because “ right now the Internet is the
only area of freedom outside all political
c o n t r o l ,” s ays Lyonnel T h o u venot of
R e p o rt e rs without Frontiers.
In liberal democracies, where most
e f f o rts to ban mat e rial on the Intern e t
are focused on sites with paedophile and
racist content, the first attempt to control
the Web dates back to 1995. T h at is when
the US Congress passed the Communi-
c ation Decency A c t , which aimed to
s e verely punish the transmission of
“ s h o c k i n g ” and “ i n d e c e n t ” m at e ri a l
through computer networks in the name
of the protection of children. Under the
t e rms of the law, v i o l at o rs could fa c e
fines of up to $250,000 and two - year pri-
son sentences. A ye a r
l ater the act was ru l e d
unconstitutional and
s t ruck down by the
Supreme Court . In the
name of freedom of
e x p r e s s i o n , n e o - n a z i
sites have also been
a l l owed to continue in
the United States and
to flourish in Den-
m a r k .
In Germ a ny last May, a Munich court
c o nvicted Felix Somm, the former local
manager of the service provider Compu-
S e rve , of spreading porn o graphic mat e ri a l
over the Internet through newsgr o u p s ,
handing down a suspended two - year pri-
son sentence and fining him 100,000
m a r k s.The conviction has been appealed.
The judicial authorities in Germ a ny are
also uncompromising when it comes to

tions of content that could endanger stat e

The matter becomes even more com-
plicated if encryption is
taken into account.The
main way in which the
flow of inform ation on
the Internet is control-
led is by states refusing
to make encry p t i o n
technology totally avai-
l a b l e . E n c ryption tech-
nology is based on a kind
of lock that can be ope-
ned by a key known only to the two corres-
pondents and makes it possible to read mes-
sages that were sent in code. Ending that
monopoly would technically mean ending
c e n s o rship on the Internet because anyo n e
would be able to send or receive an encry p-
ted message that no unauthorized pers o n
would be able to read. In fa c t , e ve ry stat e
f e a rs that these massive , r e p e at e d , c r o s s -
border electronic exchanges,which escape
all control, will limit their powers and pri-
vileges in the age of globalization.Some of
these powe rs are legi t i m ate if they help com-
b at money-laundering or the spread of pae-
d o p h i l i a .O t h e rs are obsolete.The gr owth of
electronic trade requires total protection of
p ayment methods,which themselves depend
on secure encry p t i o n . But most expert s
a gree that the Internet must move out of its
present pri m i t i ve stage, in which scholars
and “ p l u g g e d - i n ” individuals exchange
i n f o rm at i o n , and become an instrument of
mass commercial communicat i o n ,w h e t h e r
it is used by companies between themselve s ,
by producers,or by consumers.
O r g a n i z ations that defend freedom of
expression on the Intern e t , such as the A m e-
rican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and
the Electronic Frontier Fo u n d ation (EFF),
are fighting for the total availability of encry p-
tion technology,especially Pretty Good Pri-
va cy (PGP).This software may be ava i l a b l e
to all Internet users in the United Stat e s ,
but only in a ve rsion that is also in the pos-
session of law enforce-
ment officials.In France,
e n c ryption is done with
special permission from
the gove rnment so that
the police can read the
i n f o rm at i o n .
There’s no escaping
o n e ’s roots.The military
designed the Intern e t
because they wanted a
c o m m u n i c ations network with so many
r a m i fic ations that the system wo u l d n ’t be
paralysed by destroying one of its part s. J u s t

Putting 
a price 
on life
The current spate of lawsuits brought by
c a n c e r- s t r i c ken smokers or their rela-
tives in the United States has taken the
debate on smoking onto new ethical
g r o u n d s. As lawyers for incriminated
tobacco companies point out, the decision
to smoke is an individual choice. I t
becomes a matter of public interest, s a y
their opponents, when governments have
to foot the medical bills for treating
tobacco evils.
In the US legal system, it is not enough
to prove a wrong. You have to “ q u a n t i f y ”
the damages. This is where the law gets
t r i c k y, according to Tom Pursell, s e n i o r
counsel for the Attorney General of Minne-
s o t a , which on 8 May 1998 settled one of
the biggest tobacco lawsuits, involving 11
American and British companies.
“With epidemiologists testifying as to
which diseases and conditions are caused
by smoking,” says Pursell. “we went
through Medicaid [public medical system
for the poor] payment files from 1976 to
1996 to calculate what we consider a
c o n s e r vative figure–$1.3 billion.”
“Junk science! Bad data!” roared the
defence lawyers, quick to find holes in the
a c c o u n t i n g . For example, what about the
money the state had raised in excise taxes
on cigarette packs? More importantly, t h e
industry was prepared to argue that it had,
in fact, saved the medical system $2 billion
in nursing home costs, as smokers die pre-
maturely and need less long-term care.
The court found it “abhorrent and hor-
rendously contrary to public policy that a
party should, in whatever guise, claim that
the killing of individuals should be used as
a defence or a factor in mitigating
d a m a g e s,” and rejected the so-called
“death benefit” defence on 24 Ja n u a r y
1 9 9 8 . “ The judge was hopelessly biased,”
says Michael Yo r k , who represented
tobacco giant Philip Morris, “and made it a
point to disregard the facts.” All the same,
the defence agreed to settle out of court
for more than $6 billion. ■
States remain attached to their privileges. . . .

becomes even 
more complicated 
if encryption is 
taken into account
Dubious s e r v e rs
Internet service providers have
proliferated at a breathtaking
p a c e. There were 213 in 1981,
1,000 in 1984,100,000 in 1989,
a million in 1992 and 9.5 million
in 1996.Between mid-1995 and
m i d - 1 9 9 6 , five million servers
were created.
The European Union has iden-
t i fied the following areas where
the Internet can be abused by
the transmission of harmful or
illegal information or even by
criminals:
• national security (terrorism or
instructions for making bombs
or illegal drugs);
• protection of minors (violence
and pornography);
• protection of human dignity
(racial discrimination and inci-
tement to racial hatred);
• economic security (fraud, i n s-
tructions on credit card piracy);
• protection of information;
• protection of privacy (unau-
thorized communication of per-
sonal data,e-mail harrassment);
• protection of one’s good
name (libel,illegal comparative
advertising);
protection of intellectual pro-
perty (unauthorized distribution
of copyright material, such as
software and music). ■

Bi l b a o ’s Guggenheim Museum
c e l e b r ates its first annive rs a ry in
O c t o b e r. In the year since the
d o o rs first opened, the gigantic glass and
titanium building designed by Califor-
nian architect Frank O. G e h ry has at t r a c-
ted more visitors than the population of
the city which it has helped to place
firmly on the world cultural map.
In the early 1990s, f o l l owing the decline
of its heavy industry and the shut-down of
s t e e lworks and shipya r d s ,Bilbao might have
become a backward-looking city immers e d
in nostalgi a .I n s t e a d , at a time when Seville
was inaugurating Spain’s first high-speed
train and smartening itself up to celebrate its
U n i ve rsal Exposition, Barcelona was sta-
ging its Olympic Games and Madrid wa s
chosen as the Council of Europe’s “Cultu-
ral Capital of Europe”, this port on the
Atlantic coast of nort h e rn Spain decided to
look to the future and discard its traditional
image as a grey city with nothing to offer
but its financial status as the headquarters
of Spain’s leading banks and the country’s
second biggest stock market in terms of tur-
n ove r. In short , it embarked on a revo l u t i o n
which is still only in its early stages.
With suppor t from the European
U n i o n , the Spanish and Basque gove rn-
m e n t s , the regional council and pri vat e
e n t e rp ri s e , a wide range of initiat i ve s
were launched to transform industri a l
Bilbao into a city of culture and serv i c e s
with the aid of noted architects from all
over the wo r l d . Façades were cleaned,
p o rt facilities were renovat e d , the airp o rt
was modern i z e d , an eighteen-year motor-
way construction plan got under way and
drainage schemes were drawn up to
enable the ri ver Nervión to be used for
Life looked grim as the industrial heart of this
Basque city ground to a halt. But an ambitious

r e c r e ational sailing.The whole operat i o n
will cost around $1,500 million.
One major project was to provide Bil-
bao with a metro. This idea, in abeya n c e
since the 1970s, was executed by the Bri-
tish architect Norman Fo s t e r , w h o s e
f u t u ristic semi-circular fa n - s h a p e d
entrances to the first line were immedia-
tely dubbed “fo s t e ri t o s”– “little Fo s-
t e rs”–by the Bilbainos. The metro has
helped soak up the traffic snarls that pla-
gued this city of 370,000 inhabitants–a
million counting the subu r b s.
The Guggenheim Museum is the keys-
tone of this vast progr a m m e . It was gi ve n
the go-ahead after a marathon series of mee-
tings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Fo u n-
d ation in New York with the Basque autho-
ri t i e s , represented at the highest level by the
head of the autonomous government.The
f o u n d at i o n ’s administrat o rs , who wa n t e d
to create a new European museum, in addi-
tion to those in Berlin and Venice,to show
their celebrated collection of modern and
c o n t e m p o r a ry art , chose Bilbao after Seville,
M a d ri d ,Vienna and Salzburg turned the
o p p o rtunity dow n . The project has been
totally funded by the Basques. The city
a u t h o rities provided the land–a disused
industrial site in the port district,the auto-
nomous gove rnment and the prov i n c i a l
a u t h o rities coughed up
$154 million,and eighty
p ri vate companies pled-
ged to make a contribu-
tion of one kind or ano-
t h e r. In return , t h e
foundation promised to
put its collections at the
m u s e u m ’s disposal, t o
handle management and
a d m i n i s t r ation and to
organize exhibitions.T h e
Bilbao Guggenheim has
also assembled its ow n
collection of wo r k s , largely by contempo-
rary artists. Paintings by Willem De Koo-
ning, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschen-
berg can be seen alongside works by
i m p o rtant Basque artists such as T x o m i n
Badiola, Eduardo Chillida and Prudencio
Irazabal.
The museum was inaugurated on 18
October 1997 in the presence of King
Juan Carlos and a 10,000-strong crow d .
In the first month, it attracted 100,000
v i s i t o rs , becoming Spain’s third most
popular museum, after the Prado and the
Reina Sofia in Madri d . After eight
m o n t h s , 700,000 entries had been regi s-
tered (the most optimistic forecasts had
predicted 400,000 visitors in the firs t
t we l ve months), a quarter of whom we r e
v i s i t o rs to Spain. According to data col-
lected by the museum, 86 per cent of the
v i s i t o rs said they wanted to come again.
The Guggenheim effect was born .
The last gr e at museum built in the twe n-
tieth century stands in what was once a
waterfront area littered with empty contai-
ners. It is currently hosting (until 22 Octo-
ber) an exhibition of 5,000 ye a rs of Chi-
nese art , from neolithic times to the modern
e r a .Bilbao is the only European city to hold
the show. On its 10,000 square metres of
exhibition space–nineteen galleries on three
f l o o rs–sculptures and seri graphs by the
Basque artist Cristina Iglesias are also on
view (until Ja n u a ry 1999). One of the rooms,
130 metres long and 30 metres wide, is easily
spacious enough to accommodate a foot-
ball mat c h .The museum also comprises an
auditorium, a library, a restaurant serving
r e gional specialities and a bookshop contai-
ning the latest books on contemporary pain-
ting.
But the Bilbao Guggenheim is some-
thing more than an art museum. Its cha-
r a c t e ristic silhouette has been a backdrop for
TV commercials and pop gr o u p s – S m a s h i n g
Pumpkins launched their latest disc there,
and Simple Minds used the gallery as a set-
ting for their videoclip G l i t t e r b a l l. C o u t u-
riers Carolina Herrera and Paco Rabanne
have transformed the central atrium into a
c at walk to present their collections. For the
first time in ye a rs ,d a m p,
grey Bilbao is becoming
k n own to the world for
something other than
t e rr o rist violence and
kidnapping.
H ow are the Bilbai-
n o s , whose city once
only received a bri e f
w rite-up in the touri s t
g u i d e s , reacting to this
newly acquired reputa-
tion? At first they we r e
sceptical about the
whole thing, r e m e m b e rs journalist Fe l i x
L i n a r e s.Then they gradually realized that
it was serious and today they are deligh-
t e d . “A familiar sight elsewhere, such as a
Japanese tourist taking photos, was some-
thing quite new here!” s ays Linares, w h o
notes that it’s still virtually impossible to
find a restaurant open on a Sunday eve-
n i n g .
Angel Gago, S e c r e t a ry-General of the
B i s c ay Hotels A s s o c i at i o n , thinks that
there has definitely been a boost to tou-
ri s m . “Until not so long ago the prov i n c e
mainly attracted business people,” h e
s ay s. “They came during the week for
trade exhibitions. From Monday to Fri-
d ay there was a decent rate of room
o c c u p at i o n , but on Sat u r d ay and Sunday
the place was deserted”–especially since
m a ny locals leave the city during we e-
The tomb
that lost its
h e a d
On 27 November 1996, thieves behea-
ded a stone statue from a tomb of the
Song Dynasty (960-1279) in Gongyi, a city
in China’s central Henan Province. Sold by a
peddler to a Hong Kong businessman for
6,500 yuan ($812), the head changed
hands three more times before fetching
25,000 yuan in Hong Ko n g .
It looked like just another case of cultural
t r a f f i c k i n g , a plague for developing coun-
tries rich in antiquities but lacking the
means to protect them. In China, t o m b - r a i-
ding is on the rise, with gangs smuggling
relics from the mainland to Hong Ko n g ,
where middlemen spirit them off mostly to
the US and UK. While the trade’s extent
remains a mystery, Chinese police and cus-
toms officers uncovered more than 14,000
smuggled relics in 1997.
The story of the Gongyi head took an
unexpected turn. The Hong Kong police
were on the track of the object, when it
suddenly disappeared—leading the Chi-
nese to turn to Interpol for the first time.
“ This is one more aspect of China’s
openness to the international community,”
says Lyndel Prott of UNESCO’s Cultural
Heritage Division, “and it couldn’t have
ended better.”
While only about 12% of stolen relics
reported to Interpol are recovered, the Gon-
gyi piece was found in July 1997. It wa s
about to come under the hammer of a San
Francisco auction house for $600,000.
But before a stolen relic can be recove-
r e d , the international conventions require
the claimants to prove that it has actually
been stolen. This is not always easy. In this
c a s e, the Chinese proved their point with
photographs of the intact statue originally
t a ken to classify the tomb as a monument.
To d a y, the relic is safe in Chinese hands, o n
its way back to the shoulders of the now
famous Song statue. ■

kends for nearby beaches. To d ay the
annual rate of hotel-room occupation is
around 42 per cent. “ We are wo rried by
talk of building four or five new hotels
which could not be absorbed in the
i m m e d i ate future, and increased capacity
would force us to lower pri c e s ,s o m e t h i n g
we want to avo i d ,” s ays Gago. The tou-
rists who visit Bilbao today are relat i ve l y
well off, and Gago points out that “ t h e
hotels and restaurants which have bene-
fited most are the fifteen or twenty feat u-
red in the tourist guides, whereas all told
the city has 8,000 cat e ring establish-
m e n t s.”
Gago believes that anyone who drops in
on Bilbao today is a candidate for a return
v i s i t .“ D o n ’t forget,” h e
s ay s.“ We have the Gehry
M u s e u m ,Fo s t e r ’s metro,

the Palace of Congr e s s e s
designed by César Pe l l i ,
an Argentinian architect
living in New Yo r k , i n
other words works by five
or six wo r l d - famous architects within a few
kilometres of each other.”
In her book T x o ri bu ru ( “ L i n n e t
Head”) the Bilbao writer and illustrat o r
Asun Balzola describes her city as it wa s
in the 1940s. “These were ye a rs of iron
and we lived at Bilbao, also a city of iron,
a lways we t , gleaming and black because
it was always raining. . . . The green sha-
d ows of umbrellas stained the streets and
houses blackened by smoke from the fa c-
t o ri e s. . . . Bilbao was a replica of Coke-
t ow n , the imagi n a ry industrial town des-
c ribed by Dickens in Hard Ti m e s.”To d ay
Balzola smiles as she describes her city’s
new image. “The district where I spent
my childhood has changed beyond belief.
Then it was a noisy industrial area, t o d ay
i t ’s a ve ry peaceful place. Bilbao was a
grey city like . . . well . . . M a n c h e s t e r
p e r h a p s. N ow it’s white, l u m i n o u s.”W h at
s u rp rises her most is that “people have
adopted the Guggenheim Museum, t h e y
d o n ’t see it as the property of gentlemen
in New York but as something of their
ow n . The most encouraging thing is that
young people are the chief admirers.”
And she adds: “When yo u ’re inside the
bu i l d i n g, the light, and the spirals of the
architecture almost make you forget its
c o n t e n t s. You would almost be willing to
visit it if it was empty. The Guggenheim
has made Bilbao a much more at t r a c t i ve
c i t y. You can see it from many parts of
t ow n . You walk along a street and sud-
denly there is this gr e at
titanium-clad moun-
tain in front of yo u . I t
p l ays tricks on yo u .”
Meanwhile other
projects are fuelling the
on-going Bilbao revo l u-
t i o n . “In the next three
or four ye a rs the city will
totally change,” s ay s
G u i l l e rmo Fe rn a n d e z , a Bilbao city official.
In a few months’time the Euskalduna Pa l a c e
of Congresses and Music will be inaugura-
t e d . Likened by its architects, Fe d e ri c o
S o riano and Maria Dolores Pa l a c i o s , to a
ship under construction;its role will be to
put Bilbao on the intern ational opera,
concert and congress circuits.
Meanwhile the Gehry Museum, t h e
younger brother of Frank Lloyd W ri g h t ’s
building on New Yo r k ’s Fifth Ave n u e , h a s
already taken its place in the annals of
t we n t i e t h - c e n t u ry architecture. O u t s i d e

Sixty years of art-loving 
The Guggenheim Foundation was
set up in New York in 1937 to pro-
mote contemporary art and manage
the collection belonging to the Swiss-
born patron of the arts Solomon R.
Guggenheim.It administers two mu-
seums in New Yo r k ,one in Ve n i c e,o n e
in Berlin,and now one in Bilbao.
In 1943 the foundation commis-
sioned architect Frank Lloyd W r i g h t
to design its spiral-shaped first
New York museum, which was ope-
ned in 1958 on Fifth A v e n u e, a sto-
n e ’s throw from Central Pa r k . I n
Ve n i c e, the Venier dei Leoni p a l a c e
is the home of the collection of
Peggy Guggenheim, S o l o m o n ’s
n i e c e, who by the time of her death
in 1979 had assembled an outstan-
ding collection of abstract and sur-
realist art.
The Guggenheim collection has
regularly been enriched by fresh
acquisitions and donations. W i t h
some 10,000 works, it is the worl-
d ’s most important private collec-
tion of modern and contemporary
a r t , comprising expressionist,
c u b i s t ,f u t u r i s t i c ,d a d a i s t ,n e o p l a s t i c
and surrealist works signed by
artists including Vasily Kandinsky.
Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, S a l-
vador Dalí, Alberto Giacometti,
Marc Chagall and René Magritte.
What makes the Guggenheim
Foundation special is its desire to
form a network of museums and
exhibition centres in different parts
of the world. Although its head-
quarters is in New Yo r k , the delibe-
rate absence of a nerve-centre
helps it to save costs when moun-
ting temporary exhibitions, t o
increase its income from sponsor-
ship and to keep its works moving
a r o u n d . The Guggenheim system
has been described, by some admi-
r i n g l y, by others grudgingly, as a

‘N o one shall be subjected to arbitr
interference with his pri va cy, fa m i l y,
home or correspondence.. . . Eve-
ryone has the right to the protection of the
l aw against such interference or at t a c k s.”
This may not be the best-known article of
the Unive rsal Declaration of Human Rights,
but the gr owing invasion of pri va cy by digi-
tal technology and the Internet is bringing
it to the fore.
A number of opinion polls among
I n t e rnet users show that protection of
d ata about their personal lives has
become a major concern .The inventor of
the World Wide Web himself, Tim Ber-
n e rs - L e e , said recently he was wo rri e d
about the consequences for pri vate life of
use of the Intern e t . C y b e rspace expert s ,
consumer advo c ates and human ri g h t s
d e f e n d e rs all wa rn that the “ b i g - b r o t h e-
ri z at i o n ” of society is steadily adva n c i n g .
And the political police are no longer the
only ones invo l ve d , nor even the main
p e rp e t r at o rs of it, at least in the We s t e rn
d e m o c r a c i e s.
These days,the most skilful manipula-
tors of new information and communica-
tions technology to build up files on indivi-
duals are pri vate companies collecting per-
sonal data on tens of millions of people.
Simon Davies, the British head of Privacy
I n t e rn at i o n a l , a human rights wat c h d o g
gr o u p, s ays eve ry citizen of an industri a l i z e d
c o u n t ry appears today in about 200 different
data bases. Such mines of information are
c e n t r a l i z e d , sifted through and corr e l at e d
to produce very detailed profiles of consu-
m e rs.The files are then resold to all kinds of
firm s , which use them to sharpen their mar-
keting strat e gi e s , assess the economic relia-
bility of customers and adjust to specific
commercial demands.
The Internet is an ideal tool for this
meticulous task of cat e g o rizing the popu-
l at i o n . It is an extraordinary source of
d ata as well as a practical way to handle
such inform ation and circulate it. C a n a-
d a ’s commissioner for the Protection of
P ri vate Life, B ruce Phillips, noted in
1996 that surfing the Web was a bit like
p l aying stri p - p o k e r: you start by taking
off your tie and before you know where
you are, your trousers have disappeared.
In other wo r d s , “ a n o nymity is not the
rule on the Intern e t , still less is the idea
t h at you don’t leave any traces behind
yo u .”This wa rning by France’s Commis-
sion on Data Processing and Freedoms
(CNIL) applies to a broad range of prac-
tices designed to tap into the secrets of
I n t e rnet users. Most websites include
some kind of questionnaire to fill in. T h e
US Federal Trade Commission says 85
per cent of 1,400 commercial sites it loo-
ked at in March 1998 gathered pers o n a l
i n f o rm ation in this way. A medical clinic,
for example, i nvited consumers to sub-
mit their name, postal and e-mail
addresses and insurance company and to
make comments about their health pro-
b l e m s. Some on-line services require
such details before they will gi ve access
to their site.
Internet users can lie to get past these
Cybersnoopers

In the digital age, how can privacy be protected without infringing people’s
freedom to trade via Internet?
UN E S C O calls Infoethics m e e t i n g
The worldwide spread of new
information technologies and
the emergence of an associated invi-
sible economy which ignores natio-
nal frontiers and laws underline the
urgency of political regulation and
an ethical vision of the “global infor-
mation society.” With this in mind,
UN E S C O is organizing the second Info-
Ethics congress, bringing together
several hundred people, i n c l u d i n g
some 30 leading international
e x p e r t s, in Monte Carlo from October
1 - 3 .
“ C y b e r s o c i e t y ” has made the
world a single country of which we
are all destined to be citizens, a s
long as we have effective access to
i n f o r m a t i o n . As economic, fin a n c i a l
and technological globalization
p r o c e e d s, we need to develop
world citizenship and governance
which guarantee access to quality
public information and call for new
tools of government. Factors in a
fairer and more democratic infor-
mation society include free access
to public and government informa-
t i o n , serious study of how priva c y
can be protected in the face of new

q u e s t i o n s.A study by the Unive rsity of Geor-
gi a , in the United Stat e s , s h owed that 40
per cent did so when the questions got too
detailed.But “most people are very naïve,”
s ays Alain We b e r , an Internet expert with
the French League for Human Rights.
“They wo u l d n ’t be so free with the infor-
mation if they knew how it could be used.”
A US banker in Mary l a n d , for example,
recently obtained a list of cancer patients,
m atched them with his customers and then
a u t o m atically rejected loan applicat i o n s
from those who were ill.
D ata seekers on the Internet stop at
n o t h i n g . The US Federal Trade Commis-
sion is concerned about the “ t r o u b l i n g ”
practices of commercial websites aimed at
c h i l d r e n : nine out of 10 of them extract
information from these young people and
f e wer than a quarter suggest asking
p e rmission from their parents before
providing it.
M e a n w h i l e , cy b e rsleuths use many tools
and monitoring programmes to record peo-
ple’s movements around cyberspace.Data
banks like DejaNews index all messages in
on-line discussion gr o u p s.A nyone can type
in the name of a person,click on “profile”
and get their e-mail address and all the mes-
sages they have sent to the gr o u p, which will
p r ovide inform ation about their tastes, a b o u t
h ow they spend their leisure time and what
their opinions are. The CNIL also notes
t h at the gat h e ring and use of e-mail for com-
mercial ends is a basic problem.
To make matters worse,the Internet is
a world of invisible tracks. You get the
impression when you surf the web that you
l e ave no traces behind yo u . The truth is
r ather different. Some sites place spying
devices, or “cookies”, on your computer’s
hard dri ve the moment you log on to them,
so they can tell which pages of the site you
h ave looked at , when you looked, and for
We b s i t e of the month
h t t p : / / w w w. f a o. o rg
From its Headquarters in the Eternal City comes the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) web-
s i t e. Rated “ e x c e p t i o n a l ” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which placed it among the top 1% of
65,000 sites profil e d , it is available in English, Fr e n c h , Spanish and A r a b i c , and provides answers to
everything you always wanted to know about food (as well as agriculture, fis h e r i e s, forestry and
more) but were unable to ask.
As well as extensive statistical data covering 210 countries and territories, it provides access to
early warning systems on food and agriculture emergencies and prevention systems for animal and
plant pests and diseases. A mapping system for information on food insecurity and vulnerability is in
the pipeline.
Participate in a number of ongoing e-mail conferences or in this year’s Food for all f u n d - r a i s i n g
c a m p a i g n . Search or browse through more than 3,000 of the most recent and relevant pictures in
FAO ’s photo library. Currently featured: tropical fruit. Did you know that the 4 most traded fruits are
p i n e a p p l e s, m a n g o e s, avocados and papayas, imports of which totalled $2.2 billion in 1996 alone?
If you live in an area where the Internet is not yet ava i l a b l e, do not despair: FAO distributes CD-
ROMS with similar information. ■

The battle 
of 
the bug
As the third millennium draws near, t h e
entire world is threatened by the mil-
lennium bug, an unprecedented computer
phenomenon that could have effects as
wide-ranging as erasing maps to minefie l d s
and a recession more severe than the one
caused by the 1973 oil price hike.
Computers were programmed to indicate
dates with just two characters–98 for
1998–to save memory. At zero hour on 1
January 2000 their clocks could turn back a
century to the year 1900. The consequences
could be unfortunate–an elevator could
abruptly come to a halt between flo o r s – o r
disastrous–the computers that help operate
a nuclear power plant’s cooling system or
manage air traffic could stop running.
To avoid such scenarios, programs must
be modifie d , tested and harmonized. Th o s e
operations are technically simple, but they
require an exhaustive review of hundreds
of millions of applications in every area
from banking to manufacturing and health-
c a r e.
This painstaking task requires implemen-
ting major projects, hiring highly skilled
w o r kers and purchasing new hardwa r e, l e a-
ding the world’s largest companies to make
substantial investments. But for many busi-
n e s s e s, especially small- and medium-sized
f i r m s, it is apparently already too late to
tackle the problem.
According to upper-end estimates, on a
planetary scale the operation will cost one
trillion dollars, but the tab could soar even
higher as the deadline nears and unexpec-
ted snags crop up, especially since the cor-
rections made to programs themselves
cause new problems.
The millennium bug has mobilized armies
of computer programmers in the United
S t a t e s, Canada and the United Kingdom,
but the problem has drawn scant attention
in other industrialized countries, such as
Fr a n c e. M e a n w h i l e, Asia is crippled by its
banking crisis and the developing countries
are too poor to afford to modify their com-
puter systems. ■
logy adviser Ira Magaziner has even threa-
tened to go to the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) about it.At the same time,he
insists that the US is just as concerned to
protect the pri va cy of its citizens as European
g ove rnments are.And all studies show that
Internet commerce cannot succeed unless
c o n s u m e rs can count on inform ation about
themselves being kept confidential.
Behind such skirmishing lies the fa m i l i a r
difference of approach between the US and
E u r o p e . The former trusts the market to
s o l ve the trickiest problems, while the lat t e r
prefers to set up public-sector bodies to do
s o. Though the A m e rican authorities are
well aware of the need to reassure Internet
u s e rs , they are also sympathetic to the argu-
ments of direct marketing and financial lob-
b y i s t s , who think the solution lies less in
imposed regulation than professional self-
r e g u l ation through codes of conduct and
the development of encryption technology
and ways of erasing individual tracks left in
cyberspace.
EPIC assessed the effectiveness of self-
r e g u l ation by looking at the websites of firm s
which were members of the Direct Marke-
ting A s s o c i ation (DMA), which opposes
a ny legi s l at i ve interfe-
r e n c e . It concluded that
“the DMA’s efforts to
promote pri va cy prac-
tices is having little
impact on its new mem-
b e rs ,e ven after repeat e d
assurances from the
DMA that this approach
is effective.”
The Federal Trade Commission came to
the same conclusion after a wide-rangi n g
s u rvey published in June 1998. It said that
“the industry ’s efforts to encourage vo l u n t a ry
adoption of the most basic fair inform at i o n
practice pri n c i p l e – n o t i c e – h ave fallen far short
of what is needed to protect consumers.”
Pressure from consumers and from
Europe may force firms to change their
mode of operation. If it does not, we may
lose not only the freedom to buy and sell
but also our personal freedom.“The adve n t
of the surveillance society will bring with it
a new era of social control,” warns Davies.
“The two have always existed hand in hand.”

The range and power of new technolo-
gies are creating a formidable “ s u rve i l l a n c e
e c o n o my,” s ays Dav i e s. So strengthening
protection of the right to pri va cy is an urgent
matter. The European Union directive on
“the protection of individuals with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the
free movement of such dat a ” is a step in this
direction.
Under the directive, which comes into
effect on 25 October 1998, the processing of
d ata about ethnic ori gi n s , political opinions,
r e l i gious and philosophical beliefs, t r a d e
union members h i p, health and sex life, i s
prohibited except where
there are special exe m p-
tions or derogat i o n s.
M o r e ove r , in each of the
European Union’s fif-
teen Member Stat e s , a
special authority is to
protect individual’s
rights and freedoms with
regard to the processing
of personal data.It is to guarantee citizens
the right to be informed, to have access to
data concerning them and the right to cor-
rect it, and to erase data whose processing
does not comply with the provisions of the
d i r e c t i ve .A rticle 25 states the principle that
the transfer of personal data to third coun-
t ries may only take place if the receiving
countries offer a level of protection that is
“ a d e q u at e ” within the meaning of EU legi s-
l at i o n .“If the European plan succeeds,” s ay s
Davies in the American monthly magazine
W i r e d, “ e ve ry country on earth will soon
adhere to a global pri va cy code. If it fa i l s ,t h e
United States and Europe could end up in
the throes of an ugly trade war over the inter-
national transfer of personal information.”
In a globalized economy where infor-
m ation about consumers is the new gold
m i n e , the stakes are huge, i nvolving no more
and no less than the future of all banking
and trade transactions, especially electro-
nic.The United States has already gone on
the offensive by accusing Europe of using
p ri va cy protection laws to erect barri e rs
around the valuable European market of

■ What is the Biotech Century?
Our futurists have too narr owly defined the
t we n t y - first century as the inform ation age.
In fact, a far more profound shift is taking
place in the global economy. C o m p u t e rs
and genes are beginning to fuse into a single
p owerful technological and economic force
t h at is laying the foundation for the biotech
century. Computers are increasingly being
used to decipher,manage and organize the
vast genetic inform ation that is the raw
resource of the new global economy.A l r e a d y
m u l t i n ational corp o r ations are creating gi a n t
life-science complexes from which to fa s h i o n
a bio-industrial world.
There are tremendous short - t e rm bene-
fits–new plants and animals,new pharma-
ceuticals and energy sources. But it is naive
to believe that these benefits come with no
c o s t s.The env i r o n m e n t a l , social and ethical
i m p l i c ations of this science are chilling.W i l l
the creation of cloned,chimeric and trans-
genic species mean the end of nature? Will
the mass release of genetically engineered
organisms into our biosphere mean genetic
pollution and irr e ve rsible damage to the
biosphere in the twe n t y - first century? W h at
are the risks of making a “perfect”baby?
■ But how does this differ from our long-
standing struggle to redesign nature?
It is true that we have been engi n e e ri n g
n ature since the dawn of the Neolithic revo-
lution in agri c u l t u r e , but the new gene-spli-
cing technologies are qualitat i vely different.
In classical breeding, it is only possible to
cross close relatives in the biological king-
d o m . To d ay, h owe ve r , we are no longer
constrained by these biological boundari e s.
For example, scientists have taken the gene
t h at emits light in a fir e fly and injected it
into the genetic code of a tobacco plant,
which when fully gr ow n ,g l ows twe n t y - f o u r
h o u rs a day.We have not seen that in evo l u-
t i o n . Genetically engineered plants,m i c r o -
organisms and animals bring greater risks.
■ In discussions surrounding the use of
gene therapy to cure or prevent human
disease, you raise the question as to who
should decide what is a “good”or “bad”
gene.Are we heading into a new age of
eugenics?
Yes, but it doesn’t bear any resemblance to
w h at we saw in Nazi Germ a ny. The new
eugenics is not social eugenics. It is banal
and friendly. It is commercial and market-
d ri ve n . S o o n , p r o s p e c t i ve parents will be
able to programme the biological future of
their unborn children.They will feel pressure
to rid their children of “undesirable traits”.
If you knew you were going to pass on a
gene for leukemia, wouldn’t you like to eli-
m i n ate that from the sperm or the egg? A n d
w h at about obesity or near-sightedness?
Once we begin this journ e y, there is really no
place to stop. Chilling eugenics issues will
arise as we begin to see our children as the
ultimate shopping experience.
We already see this happening. In the
1 9 8 0 s , the Genetech and Eli Lilly compa-
nies were awarded patents to market a
new genetically engineered gr owth hor-
mone to the few thousand children suffe-
ring from dwa r fism in the United Stat e s.
By 1991, the hormone had become one
of the best selling pharmaceutical dru g s
in the country. C l e a r l y, d o c t o rs were pres-
c ribing the drug to children who were just
s h o rter than their peers. The companies
are now pushing doctors to redefine nor-
mal shortness as an “ i l l n e s s ” .
■ Some critics have branded you as an
alarmist–they consider your views to be
anti-science.These critics go too far, but
at some level,do you feel that we should
restrain this new genetic science?
I believe that genetic science is invaluable;
the question is not the science but the tech-
n o l o gical application of that science. We
must choose between a hard path and a soft
p ath to the twe n t y - first century. In the case
of agri c u l t u r e , for example, the hard pat h
would lead to genetically engineered plants,
environmental risks and health problems.
In contrast, the soft path would mean
using the same genetic sciences to create a
s o p h i s t i c ated and sustainable organic agri-
c u l t u r e .The rule of thumb we ought to apply
is clear: do no harm . S e c o n d l y, a lway s
choose the path that is least likely to foreclose
o p p o rtunities for those not yet here and the
one that is most able to sustain relat i o n s h i p s
instead of draining them.
■ Who is behind this new age of genetic
commerce?
Giant life-science companies are manœu-
vering to control genetic commerce in the
t we n t y - first century.The mergers and acqui-
sitions going on in the life science industry
ri val those in the telecommunicat i o n s ,c o m-
puter and entertainment sectors.The gi a n t
chemical companies are beginning to sell
off their chemical divisions to concentrate
solely on the life sciences.They are making
the shift from the petrochemical age to the
age of genetic commerce. Genes will be the
p ri m a ry raw mat e rial of the coming cen-
t u ry just as oil, metals and minerals were in
the colonial and industrial era.
The name of the game is pat e n t s. In the
next ten ye a rs , we will have isolated virt u a l l y
all 60,000 genes that make up the bluepri n t
for the human race.Virtually every one of

those genes will be the intellectual propert y
of these life science companies for at least
twenty years.
The whole idea of patenting genes is a
s c a m . Under US and European stat u t e s ,
you have to prove that you have inve n t e d
something that is nove l , non-obvious and
u s e f u l . So consider the example of a che-
mist in the nineteenth century isolat i n g
helium which is not obvious and certainly
u s e f u l . N ow that chemist can patent the
technique used to isolate helium but not
the element.T h at ’s because helium is not an
invention but rather a discovery of nature.
But in 1987, the US Patent Office issued
a simple paragraph saying that it was possible
to patent any genetically modified life form
except a human being after birth.The only
reason for excluding patents on humans is
that the US Constitution forbids slavery.
■ But aren’t you oversimplifying the issue.
The patents don’t really cover the genes.
They are awarded to companies and
re s e a rc h e rs to legally protect the
methods invented to isolate or use them.
They are actually patenting the genes.T h e r e
are patents on thousands of human and ani-
mal genes. For example,Myriad Genetics
has isolated a gene that causes breast cancer,
especially in Ashkenazi women (of Eastern
European Jewish ori gi n ) .The company has
a patent on that gene–it is their inve n t i o n .I f
a ny woman in the world goes for a scree-
ning for that breast cancer gene, p a rt of the
fee that she pays is in the form of a royalty to
the company.
Imagine the case of a chimpanzee with
one human gene in its genetic code. T h e
p atent office would now consider that entire
chimpanzee to be an inve n t i o n . This is a
gross violation of the mandate of the US
Patent Office and its statutes.We are now
challenging this in the US patent system.
■ How can you effectively try to counter
this trend given the tremendous finan-
cial stakes involved? 
I have joined with the distinguished cell bio-
l o gist Dr. S t u a rt Newman of New Yo r k
Medical College.We have submitted a pat e n t
to the US Patent Office containing thirt y
claims covering all the human-animal chi-
meras (human-chimpanzee chimeras,
human-pig and other combinations) for
medical purposes. As of now, there are no
existing patents on this kind of chimera.
If we are granted this pat e n t , we will
claim a “genetic conserva n cy ” to forbid any
researcher from crossing human-animal
b o u n d a ries with embryonic cells for twe n t y
ye a rs so that countries can have the time to
d e b ate this issue and hopefully pass the
appropriate legislation to outlaw all trans-
genic organisms.We are also seriously consi-
d e ring whether to test the patent stat u t e s
in the European Union.
■ The US and the World Trade Org a n i z a t i o n
in particular have been pressuring deve-
loping countries like India into adopting
the US model of patent laws to pro t e c t
their natural re s o u rces from exploitation.
How would you advise them?
Two positions are being championed. I think
both are inappropri at e . One position is that
of the life-science companies.The other is
t h at of many of the developing countries who
are say i n g, “ L o o k , these are our resources,
just as oil is in the Middle East.We should be
c o m p e n s at e d .O t h e r w i s e , it is biopiracy.”
But how do you ever compensate for the
b l u e p rints of life? Secondly,who do you com-
p e n s ate? Indigenous knowledge and
resources cross all tribal and national boun-
d a ri e s. For example Merck and Company
h ave an absurd relationship with Costa Rica.
They gi ve a local non-profit institute a million
d o l l a rs for access to all the country ’s ri c h
genetic dive rs i t y.Who does this institute
r e p r e s e n t ?
The gene pool should not be reduced
to commercial exploitation by either gove rn-
ments or companies. I am hoping that gene-
t i c a l l y - rich countries like India will take the
lead in developing a third way in which we
keep the gene pool open–as we did with
Antarctica–by covenant and treat y. If this
doesn’t happen, we are going to have gene
wars in the twenty-first century as we had
wa rs over oil, metals and minerals in the
i n d u s t rial era. This commercial competi-
tion and conflict over ow n e rship and control
of the gene pool will further divide the have s
and the have-nots.
■ If this is such an important issue, why has
there been so little public debate? Is the
media to blame? 
For the most part , the science and bu s i n e s s
Alarmist or seer?
A ctivism has been a way of
life for Jeremy Rifkin, b o r n
in the US state of Colorado in
1 9 4 3 . The founder and president
of the Foundation on Economic
Trends in Wa s h i n g t o n , D. C . , h e
has testified before numerous
congressional committees on
subjects ranging from germ
warfare threats to the labeling
of genetically engineered foods.
He has also been a consultant
to numerous heads of state and
o f f i c i a l s, and has lectured at
more than 300 universities in a
dozen countries. Rifkin is per-
haps best known for writing 14
books examining the impact of
scientific and technological
changes on the economy, t h e
w o r k f o r c e, society and the envi-
r o n m e n t . One of his internatio-
nal bestsellers The End of Work
( P u t n a m ,1 9 9 5 ) , is widely credi-
ted for shaping today’s debate
on corporate downsizing and
t e c h n o l o g y ’s role in displacing
the workforce.
In his latest book,The Biotech
Century: Harnessing the Gene and
Remaking the World ( Ta r c h e r / P u t-
n a m ,1 9 9 8 ) , Rifkin focuses on the
negative implications of new
genetic technologies which he
feels have been largely ignored in
public debates.The result is a frigh-
tening view of a “ b i o - i n d u s t r i a l
w o r l d ” and an explanation of
genetic commerce which has been
criticized as an unfounded back-
lash against science.
“I was raised as a reformed
J e w,”Rifkin says.“I culturally iden-
tify with that but I am not reli-
g i o u s. For me, visiting the Nazi
concentration camp at Dachau as
a young man proved to be a defi-
ning experience. . . . We all want
to make sure that such things
never happen again.But we also
have to understand that they can
and do happen in ways we don’t
suspect. That is why I have spent
so much time focusing on how
eugenicism is now becoming com-
mercial and marke t - d r i v e n . If there
is an enemy, it is all of us who, for
good reasons, want healthy
babies.” ■

September 1998 - The UNESCO Courier 49
j o u rnalists have treated the issue anecdo-
tally, reporting on a new food crop here or
a medical breakthrough there.Some of the
science wri t e rs have a cozy relationship with
the molecular biologists and the biotech
companies which they don’t want to jeo-
p a r d i z e . They also don’t feel confident in
c h a l l e n ging the scientists. But more impor-
t a n t l y, the media have not yet understood the
larger context because they have focused so
closely on the information revolution.But
once the context shifts to the broader eco-
nomic arena of genetic commerce,all of the
issues we have discussed will be on the public
agenda.
■ Is the industry trying to hinder this
debate?
There is no conspiracy. Its just that the com-
mercial flo o d g ates are opening ve ry quickly
and the biotech business leaders are just
trying to make as much money as they can
and advance their portfolios as fast as pos-
s i b l e . They don’t even see the broader
c o n t e x t . The last thing they want is to be
s l owed down by debat e .
They want to believe there
will be no problems.
At a deeper leve l , t h e r e
is a new libert a rian streak
which insists that the mar-
ket should be the final arbi-
t r at o r. This way you can
avoid a debate and just
assume that the marketplace
will decide as to what kind of
technology should be used
and how. To me, the most
chilling prospect of all is letting the mar-
ketplace and consumers decide the future
e volution of our species and other creat u r e s.
■ But how do you explain the vehemence
with which scientists respond to anyone
questioning their work?
There is a certain arrogance in science,e s p e-
cially when a particular science is coming of
a g e .We saw this with the chemists and phy-
sicists and now we see it with the biologi s t s.
This arrogance is rooted in the old Baco-
nian science which is based on powe r.B a c o n
called nature a “common little harlot.She is
w i l d . We must tame, s q u e e z e , mould and
shape her,” he said.“Knowledge is power.
We can be the masters of our destiny.”
M a ny microbiologi s t s – but not all of
t h e m – find it exciting to be able to control
d e s t i ny, to be able to be God. They are
the only ones who can not only decipher
the code of life, but administer it. T h e y
b e l i e ve that if we were capable of unders-
tanding their wo r k , we would be in
favour of it. But for them being inform e d
means knowing it as they do and accep-
ting their moral view of it. These scien-
tists do not really believe in the demo-
c r atic process. We saw the same thing
with petrochemical pollution and nuclear
e n e r g y.
■ Is there a link between this arrogance
and the growing disregard for the idea
that a species has an essential nature or
an intrinsic value? 
Ye s , this is cri t i c a l . Living beings are no lon-
ger perceived as birds and bees but as
bundles of genetic inform at i o n . All living
beings are drained of their substance and
life becomes a code to be deciphered.T h e r e
is no longer any question of sacredness or
s p e c i a l n e s s.H ow could there be when there
are no longer any recognizable biologi c a l
boundaries to respect? In this new way of
thinking about evo l u t i o n ,s t ructure is aban-
doned. Everything is pure process. So you
can mix and mat c h , and cross anything yo u
want in the biological kingdom.
The laws of nature are being rewritten to
c o n f o rm with our latest manipulation of the
n atural wo r l d .The old Darwinian notion of
the “ s u rv i val of the fit t e s t ”
is being replaced by the “ s u r-
vival of the best informed”.
Human beings, the best
“ i n f o rm ation processors ”i n
the biological kingdom,are
n ow advancing the evo l u-
t i o n a ry process by repro-
gramming nature using
genetic engineering tools.
This new cosmology
o f f e rs the ultimate justifi-
c ation for a hard-pat h
s c i e n c e . It assures us that we are follow i n g
the natural order of things and simply
m oving in the same direction as nat u r e
has already set out for us. In the next step
on this pat h , molecular biologists wo n ’t
speak of genetic engi n e e ri n g, which is too
c o l d . Instead they will consider humans
and other creatures as unfinished wo r k s
of art . Biotechnology will be seen as
p owerful “ a rtistic tools” a l l owing us to
finish the canva s.
■ After a frightening outlook for the next
century, your book ends with “the rest is
up to us”.This is frustrating.What can
we do?
It would be absurd to lay out bluepri n t s
as to what should be done. I n s t e a d , I
h ave made a diagnosis of two different
p aths for the next century. It is up to the
public and the next generation in part i-
cular to politicize and argue, c h a l l e n g e
and express their views in the streets, i n
the court s , the media, and so on.
When gr e at technological and com-
mercial revolutions sweep over civiliza-
t i o n s , there is always a window of oppor-
G l o s s a r y
B i o t e c h n o l o g y : any technique that uses living
organisms or substances from those orga-
nisms to make or modify products, p l a n t s
or animals, or to develop micro-organisms
for specific uses, such as fermentation and
waste treatment.
C h i m e ra : an organism comprising cells of two
or more distinct genomes, resulting from
experimental manipulation.
C l o n e : a group of organisms of identical gene-
tic make - u p, produced by some kind of
asexual reproduction.
E u g e n i c s : study of the possibility of impro-
ving the human gene pool.Historically asso-
ciated with some extreme political tenden-
cies and with encouragement of breeding by
those presumed to have favourable genes
and discouragement of breeding by those
presumed to have unfavourable genes.
Genetic engineering: technologies used to
isolate genes from an organism, m a n i p u-
late them and insert them in another orga-
nism.
Genome: the total genetic material within a
cell or individual.
Germ-line thera p y : attempts to prevent gene-
tic disease by transplanting genes into
human sperm,egg or embryonic cells. The
resulting changes would be passed on to
the patient’s offspring.
Recombinant DNA: the product resulting
from genetic engineering techniques to com-
bine pieces of DNA from different indivi-
duals or species.
Tra n s g e n i c : describing an organism whose
normal genome has been altered by intro-
duction of a gene by a manipulative tech-
nique,often involving introduction of DNA
from a different species.
US patent: a grant issued by the US Pa t e n t
and Trademark Office (a federal government
entity within the Department of Commerce)
that gives the patent owner the right to
exclude all others from making, using or
selling a patented invention within the US
for a specified term (generally 17 years).
Laws of nature, physical phenomena and
abstract ideas cannot be patented.

prospect of all is
letting the
marketplace and

T A L K I N G  T O . . .
50 The UNESCO Courier - September 1998
tunity to deal with the changing powe r
r e l ationships and ask what we wa n t .
We have to see past the myths that
science is value-free and technology is
n e u t r a l . If you start with the idea that the
life science corp o r ate agenda is simply
the next stage in evo l u t i o n – t h at just
because we can do something means that
we should or will do it–then there is no
point in having a debat e .
By recognizing the power of the new
t e c h n o l o gi e s , we should ask: is that appli-
c ation an appropri ate use of power? Is
t h at power manageable or uncontrol-
lable? Is that power going to potentially
foreclose our options or the options of
those not yet born ?
■ Aren’t you being rather optimistic? Don’t
you think that the lack of debate reflects
a serious flaw in society’s institutions?
I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist.
I don’t know if this generation will do the
right thing. But I am hopeful that it will.
It can create different avenues for change
instead of relying on the institutions of
society which maintain and represent the
s t atus quo.
H owe ve r , activism is not just about
shouting from the rooftops. Our passion
and intuition have to be built into an
intellectual framewo r k .We must not only
h ave a basis for discussion but an alter-
n at i ve vision.
■ Do you believe that public opinion will
have the sway needed for a soft path to
the biotech century?
I am saying that there is no public opinion
yet. Once the focus shifts to genetic com-
m e r c e , d e b ate will escalate exponen-
tially–not just on the part of activists bu t
also within industry.This is not just big cor-
porations against the citizens–there will be
a push and pull in the marketplace.
In agri c u l t u r e , for example, there will
be a major battle between organic pro-
d u c e rs and distri bu t o rs and the biotech
companies for consumers. The same will
be seen with medicine and health. T h e
p h a rmaceutical companies are going to
push hard path drugs (which I don’t
n e c e s s a rily oppose) and further down the
line somatic and germ-line therapy. O n
the other side, the insurance companies
will push to use the same science to pro-
duce sophisticated preve n t i ve health care
r ather than paying for expensive dru g s
and therapies to heal the sick.
■ Does UNESCO have a role to play in the
debate?
It would be interesting if UNESCO could
p r ovide a galvanizing place so that the non-
g ove rnmental organizations could have
more sway. UNESCO doesn’t necessari l y
h ave to take a position but through the Inter-
n ational Bioethics Committee it could offer
a forum to debate the complexities of these
issues. ■
