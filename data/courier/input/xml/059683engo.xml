culture in the making
by F. Cyril James
One hundred years ago, vast colonial territories in North America agreed
on a basis for their union as an independent sovereign state. This was
the birth of Canada's Confederation. Here, Dr. F. Cyril James, Principal
Emeritus of McGill University, Montreal, reviews Canada's efforts over
the past century to realize its cultural identity and to develop its education
and science to the full.
D'URING the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, the world was
dominated by great colonial empires.
Canada was the first country to emerge
peacefully from one of those empires
as an independent self-governing sov¬
ereign state so that this year's centen¬
nial celebration of Canadian Confede¬
ration is of profound contemporary
interest.
In 1763, the year in which Voltaire
wrote his Treatise on Tolerance and
James Boswell first met Samuel John¬
son, the Treaty of Paris transferred
Canada from French to English rule.
The country was vast, some 4,000 miles
from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
2,500 miles from the American bor¬
der to the northernmost Arctic coast¬
line, but much of this territory was un¬
known and unexplored. The climate
was almost identical to that of Siberia,
and still is. The indigenous population
comprised some tens of thousands of
Indians and Eskimos.
Three groups of refugees, disinherit¬
ed by their own countries, laid the
foundation for the development of
Canada during the remaining years of
the eighteenth century and the opening
decades of the nineteenth aided to a
greater degree than is sometimes rec¬
ognized by both Indians and Eskimos.
The first group comprised the
French-Canadian habitants, the settlers
in Quebec abandoned by the seigneurs
and government officials who returned
to France after the Treaty of Paris.
The second comprised the Scottish
immigrants who flocked to Canada
after Bonnie Prince Charlie's army was
routed at Culloden preferring freedom
F. CYRIL JAMES, distinguished educator and
economist, was for 23 years Principal and
Vice-chancellor of McGill University, Montreal.
He has been awarded honorary degrees by
no less than 30 universities and institutions
of higher education in North America, Europe
and Asia. He is the author of numerous
books and articles on economics and higher
education. Among his books: "The Economics
of Money, Credit and Banking," 1930 (3rd ed.
1941), "The Road to Revival," 1932 and (as
co-author), "The Meaning of Money." 1935,
"Economic Problems in a Changing World."
1939 and "McGill the Story of a University,"
i960. Dr. lames is now Principal Emeritus of
McGill University and an honorary president
of the International Association of Universities.
in a bleak new country to the domina¬
tion of English and Hanoverian troops
in the highlands of Scotland. The third
group, the United Empire Loyalists, was
made up of those Americans who dis¬
liked the republicanism that engender¬
ed the War of Independence and, after
1776, trekked northwards to Canada so
that they might continue to live as
loyal subjects of the King of England.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees,
speaking different languages and most
of them impoverished, living in a
country that even today can feel bleak
and inhospitable during the winter
months! The prospect that a great
nation would emerge from such a cru¬
cible must have seemed remote al¬
most incredible but Canada had one
asset of supreme importance, the fur-
bearing animals that roamed its vast
forests.
Europe wanted furs: Canada had
them to export. French, Scots and
American Loyalists worked together to
develop the fur trade, based upon
Montreal and worked is the signifi¬
cant word in this context. "The Cana¬
dian fur trade at that time was probab¬
ly the hardest in which free men ever
engaged, and some of the feats on the
rivers astound the modern imagination.
The voyageurs paddled all day at the
average rate of forty strokes to the
minute, and over the portages they
had to carry both their canoes and
their trade goods on their backs." (1)
When, on March 29, 1867, the Par¬
liament of the United Kingdom passed
the British North America Act under
which Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick were incorporated
into the Dominion of Canada, agricul¬
ture and lumbering had replaced the
fur-trade as the foundation of the
Canadian economy.
Canals and railways were beginning
to provide cheap transportation for
bulky products that moved down to the
eastern seabord and steamships car¬
ried those goods from Halifax and
Montreal to the ports of England and
other European countries. The inter¬
national economy of the nineteenth 5

A CULTURE IN THE MAKING (Continued)
The surge to nationhood
century was already taking shape, and
Canada was an integral part of it.
By 1886, the Canadian Pacific Rail¬
way had been completed, spanning the
continent from the Atlantic to the Paci¬
fic Oceans so that the motto of
Canada A Mari usque ad Mare was
indeed a statement of fundamental
truth.
Canada had become a nation. It
was developing economically and poli¬
tically, but it had not found a cultural
identity.
Universities had long been in exis¬
tence. In the Maritime Provinces, Aca¬
dia, Dalhousie, King's College and the
University of New Brunswick had be¬
gun to admit students a generation
or more before Confederation. In
Quebec the Great Seminary founded
by Bishop Laval in 1765 had become
the university that bears his name and
a steadily increasing number of col¬
leges classiques were operating under
its auspices while McGill University,
endowed by one of the outstanding fur-
traders in 1813, was educating students
in Montreal. In Ontario, the King's
College that was to become the Uni¬
versity of Toronto had been chartered
in 1827 and Queens University in 1841.
Most of these, however, were at the
time of Confederation small and strug¬
gling institutions short of money and
teaching staff: they were not destined
to attain international reputation until
the twentieth century.
Much the same must be said of the
Royal Canadian Academy and the
Royal Society of Canada, which came
into existence during the generation
following Confederation so that, in
essence, the cultural institutions of
Canade were no more than feeble
copies ur those in Europe and, to some
extent, the United States.
Even in terms of railroad transporta¬
tion, Canada was still a yast country
that demanded the best part of a week
to cross from Halifax to Victoria. Local
communities were isolated to an extent
that it is hard for us to visualise.
The cultural revolution during the
twentieth century has been dramatic,
but it did not gather momentum until
the late 1920s and early 1930s and
came to full flowering only after the
second World War. As might be ex¬
pected in a country using two langua¬
ges but with no more than a minority
of bilingual citizens, the earliest deve¬
lopments were in the graphic arts
and in music.
To cite examples (and nothing beyond
this is possible in a short article) the
Group of Seven developed a recogni¬
zably Canadian school of painting soon
after the conclusion of the first World
War and Emily Carr deserves special
mention because of her effective use
of Indian motifs in her pictures. In
Montreal, during the years of the great
depression, the Symphony Orchestra
came to birth under the leadership of
Douglas Clarke, including from its in¬
ception both French and English-
speaking musicians. But, although
there was an orchestra, there was no
adequate concert hall.
As a kind of bench-mark regarding
the largest (and, to me, most fascinat¬
ing) city in Canada, it is worth record¬
ing that orchestral, operatic and ballet
performances were staged either in
the McGill University Gymnasium or
in the Forum (normally used for ice-
hockey) until the magnificent Place des
Arts was completed in 1963. Some
cities, notably Toronto and Winnipeg,

AIRBORNE GEOLOGISTS
About 15 years ago Canada's geologists estim¬
ated that more than two-thirds of their country's
sprawling 4,000,000 square miles were still
unmapped geologically. At this rate another
century would be needed to finish even a pre¬
liminary survey. Since then the helicopter has
increasingly entered the picture and, combined
in operations with fixed wing planes, it has
enabled the Geological Survey of Canada to
map geologically as much of Canada in a
decade as in the previous 100 years. Today
Canada launches nearly a dozen airborne op¬
erations a year on missions of vital importance
for a country so dependent on mineral wealth.
Today's flying geologist can cover
in a week an area that would
previously have taken a full season
by canoe, packhorse or on foot.

helicopter examines a glacier

A CULTURE IN THE MAKING (Continued)
Leapfrogging barriers of distance
constructed splendid auditoriums a few
years earlier, but the Montreal bench¬
mark is relevant.
In a very real sense, this cultural
revolution that has given Canada a
new sense of national identity owes
much to the technological revolution
during the past few decades and to
the policies of the Government of
Canada.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corpora¬
tion, sponsored by the government, es¬
tablished a national network first by
wireless and later by television mak¬
ing it possible for all the people, no
matter how far away from the great
centres of population, to share cultural
programmes and events of national
importance.
The C.B.C. also spent money to com¬
mission new works from playwrights
and composers: it subsidised orches¬
tras and other cultural groups. Much
the same might be said of the Na¬
tional Film Board, another governmen¬
tal corporation, whose productions
were not only seen in all parts of
Canada but won acclaim at inter¬
national film festivals.
But if radio and television were the
first of the technological aids to the
emergence of a Canadian cultural
pattern, the aeroplane was the second.
When it is remembered that the eastern
coast of Newfoundland is one thousand
miles further from the western coast
of British Columbia than it is from
Paris, the significance of air travel is
apparent. As Trans-Canada Airlines
(another government corporation) de¬
veloped, one could cross Canada in
hours rather than days and Canadian
Pacific Airlines opened up the north-
land where there were no railways
and few usable roads.
T,
he Royal Society of Canada
and the more recently-created National
Research Council rapidly developed
into organizations where scholars and
scientists from all parts of the country
could meet and exchange ideas. The
National Conference of Canadian Uni¬
versities became a more lively and
effective body and more specialized
learned societies from classicists to
physicists came into existence.
All of these cultural trends, which
owed so much to modern technology,
were apparent before the end of the
second World War in 1945. They
would certainly have continued under
their own momentum but, in April 1949,
the Government of Canada gave a
powerful stimulus by appointing the
Royal Commission on National Deve¬
lopment in the Arts, Letters and Scien¬
ces with the Right Honourable Vincent
Massey as Chairman and the Most
Reverend Georges-Henri Lévesque as
Vice-Chairman.
The two years from 1949 to 1951,
when the Report of the Commission
was published, constitute a water¬
shed in Canadian cultural history.
Canadians were forced to look at
themselves and their institutions
broadcasting, art galleries, museums,
libraries, the theatre and universities.
They were forced to appraise their
own cultural image in contrast to the
familiar patterns of Europe and the
United States.
It is not possible here to
deal with all the recommendations of
the Report but two are significant
enough to demand emphasis. In
regard to the work of Canadian univer¬
sities, outside their formal programmes
of education, the Commission record¬
ed its opinion that:
"They are local centres for educa¬
tion at large and patrons of every
movement in aid of the arts, letters
and sciences. They also serve the
national cause in so many ways,
direct and indirect, that theirs must
be regarded as the finest of contri¬
butions to the national strength and
unity... Not only does the univer¬
sity serve voluntary groups, it is also
the fountain-head of a stream of
communal activities. University libra¬
ries, conservatories of music, collec¬
tions of pictures, films, gramophone
records, museum materials of all
sorts are placed at the disposal of
the public."
In recognition of these services, the
Royal Commission proposed that the
Government of Canada should make
annual grants to enlarge the revenues
of the universities and legislation was
promptly enacted to implement this
recommendation.
The second significant proposal of
the Royal Commission deserves to be
quoted in full:
"That a body be created to be
known as the Canada Council for
the Encouragement of the Arts,
Letters, Humanities and Social Scien¬
ces to stimulate and help voluntary
organizations within these fields, to
foster Canada's cultural relations
abroad, to perform the functions of
a national commission for Unesco
and... to administer a system of
scholarships."
Once again, the Government of
Canada promptly implemented the
recommendation and the Canada
Council was legally established with n
an initial endowment of $ 100,000,000. M
Not all of the cultural developments
that have occurred since 1952 can
be attributed to the Canada Council

E XPO 67 the popular name for the 1967 Universal and International
Exhibition opens this month as centrepiece of Canada's 100th birthday cele¬
brations. As host city, Montreal has prepared for the exhibition a site and a
theme worthy of the occasion. The site is a one-thousand acre largely man-made
complex of islands in the St. Lawrence River. The theme: Man and His World.
Expo's theme title was suggested
by a work of the French author and
aviator, Antoine de Saint Exupéry. In
Terre des Hommes, Saint Exupéry
wrote: "To be a man is to feel that
through one's own contribution one
helps to build a world."
To create a microcosm of man's
world past, present and future
on the St. Lawrence site, some 9,000
men. have laboured for three years.
Today, Expo 67 raises a- futuristic sky¬
line of cones, spheres, cubes, bubbles,
and other shapes in all, over 300
pavilions and structures.
The exhibition presents the story of
Man and His World Man the Creator,
Man In the Community, Man the Ex
plorer, Man the Producer, Man the Pro¬
vider in five special theme buildings
and in nearly every pavilion of over
70 participating nations. These themes
embrace the most significant aspects
of human experience and endeavour
and thus interest Unesco and the whole
United Nations family, particularly the
Food and Agriculture and the World
Health Organizations.
Expo questions, explains and dra¬
matizes man and his works. It ex¬
plores the nature of man, what he does
and where he is bound. It recounts
his struggle and coming to terms

with his environment: learning to sur¬
vive in frozen lands, combating disease
and hunger, coping with problems of
life in a modern city and now facing
the results of a world population
explosion.
In its story of Man the Explorer, for
instance, Expo shows how he has
probed deep beneath the oceans and
far into the polar regions; inwards
towards the depths of the earth and
outwards into space; how he has
devised tools to explore the minutest
workings of his own body; and it
explains what he has learned of his
physical self and his physical sur¬
roundings.
In one of the three interconnected
Explorer pavilions stands a globe two
stories high the model of a human
cell magnified a million times. Actual
living cells, feeding and multiplying,
can be viewed through microscopes,
and changing light patterns on a huge
model of the human brain explain its
structure and demonstrate how it
functions. A fully-operating laboratory
shows equipment and methods used
for exploring the biological world, and
other exhibits measure man's depen¬
dence on nature.
Man and His Planet deals with man's
exploration on, in and above the earth.
Man is already reaching out to other
worlds from his own space ship, the
earth, yet he still Inhabits less than
thirty per cent of its surface. After
abusing and destroying its resources
for centuries past, only now is he
learning to conserve natural and
mineral wealth; to replant forests and
preserve wildlife; to reclaim the arid
lands; to clean the air; to share food
and knowledge.
an above the Earth opens
a window on space exploration what
man is learning about his capacity to
survive and function in space, the
possibility of inhabiting other planets,
the search for intelligent life on distant
worlds.
Man and the Oceans depicts the
birth of our great water masses and
their exploration and conquest by man.
It introduces the age of underwater
exploration, displaying diving vehicles
that are opening up one of man's last
frontiers and a preview of its potential
wealth. A forest of ocean products
fills transparent prisms that jut from
ceiling and floor like stalactites and
stalagmites.
In Man and the Polar Regions, a
moving amphitheatre can take 2,000
people an hour on an imaginary
journey to the vast polar masses, using
multi-screen images, special sound
techniques and three-dimensional
models. The value of polar research
is stressed, especially in Antarctica
where many nations work together
on peaceful studies for science.
By 1990, more than half the world
will live in communities of 100,000 or
more. What is this cramming of man
into cities doing to community and
family life? Man in the Community
uses cartoons, puppets, films, displays
and a remarkable visible and audible
"experience" called "Citerama" to
explore the impact of the city and of
technology on man. An associated
pavilion examines the problems of
Man and Health, demonstrating such
modern medical techniques as open
heart operations and kidney grafts and
underlining man's debt to medical
science. 1 1

the producer
creates technology which, in turn,
remakes society. Yet, overwhelmed by
his own ingenuity, man often creates
situations he cannot control. Will he
become a modern Sorcerer's Appren¬

communications and computers offer
effective means to control the wealth
of technology created by man. This is
the story Man the Producer presented
under headings of resources, progress-
and control.
Man breaks through technological
barriers and multiplies his powers of
observation a millionfold. Dem¬
onstrations show how satellites in
space observe for him, how he uses
electron microscopes to probe the
structure of living cells, how infra red
and radar enables him to "see" in the
dark. Other displays show man

atom and the sun. In one, scientists

HABITAT 67 : A NEW CONCEPT
The striking housing complex shown below is
probably the most ambitious single exhibit of
Expo 67 in Montreal. The seemingly haphazard
pile of giant concrete boxes (detail right) is
one of modern architecture's boldest and most
imaginative housing designs. Stacked 120 feet
high, the blocks form 158 apartments, most
with a big terrace, all with a view and a privacy
unknown in today's conventional apartment
houses. Prefabricated on the site and with
lighting and heating fixtures installed, each unit
is swung into place by a giant crane (left).
"Habitat 67", as the project is called, offers
15 different types of homes.

MAN-MADE ISLAND. Over one half of the 400 hectare (1,000 acre)
site for Montreal's World Exhibition was reclaimed from the
St. Lawrence River. Photo left shows area in July 1963 before
work began. In centre is St. Helen's Island whose area was
doubled by reclamation. Between it and the St. Lawrence Seaway
(on right) is a complex of small islands and shoals. Photo
right shows the formidable engineering feat accomplished. A
completely new island, called Notre-Dame, has been built against
the St. Lawrence Seaway boundary dyke and is joined to
St. Helen's Island. There are now lakes and canals on both
islands. During earth-filling operations, an average truckload
entered the site every 30 seconds for 24 hours a day and
six days a week over many months. Spoil from Montreal's
metro system, then under construction, also came in handy.

schools shows what art is doing to
improve the quality and appearance
of articles in everyday use.
FF
ROM the time Expo opens
its doors on April 28, 1967, to the time
it closes on October 27, 1967, nearly
35 million people will have been added
to the world 35 million new mouths
to feed. The challenge of feeding a
hungry world which is experiencing a
population explosion is the concern
of Man the Provider, largest of the
theme layouts which fills nine pavilions
on an eight-acre site.
Man the Provider is a report on
success and failure, abundance vs.
famine, farming science vs. outdated
methods. On display are the fruits
of man's agricultural ingenuity, the
improvements he has brought to soil
science, plant and animal breeding,
insect and plant disease control,
mechanization and automation. But
the problem of using these new
techniques and of developing others
that would help feed the hungry half
of the world is never lost sight of.
The theme of Man and His World
is woven into the exhibits of most
national pavilions. Canada tells how
its people meet the challenges of cli¬
mate, distance and communications.
The United States demonstrates the
creative efforts of man in a prosperous
and automated society. The Nether¬
lands builds its story around the
struggle against the sea to achieve
living space and prosperity. The
U.S.S.R. gives prominence to
man's conquests in space exploration.
Israel's exhibit is based on the theme
of man's struggle against the desert.
Expo 67 says of itself: "In the
spectacular development of the bold
theme, Man and His World, the
exhibition will provide an educational
stimulus to mankind. The examination
of man's aspirations and man's com¬
mon goals will contribute greatly to
understanding between peoples."

A land on the move
CANADA'S FAR NORTH

HAT is the quality about
Canada's northern territories the huge

the rest of the world?
Only about 40,000 people live there.

technical assistance missions in the field.

The north is not the home of the
world-famous. For all its exotic image,
that journalists and television produ¬
cers from other countries come so far
and try so hard to catch in print and
on film, few northerners are known by
name outside Canada. And the names
of the few who are may be hard to
pronounce. Like Kenojuak, the bril¬
liant young Eskimo artist whose graphic
art and sculpture have created for her
a reputation far beyond the village of
Cape Dorset where she lives.
Is there some spell then about sheer
size and remoteness? The north is
big; a million and a half square
miles in area; one third of the second
largest, country in the world (only the
U.S.S.R. is bigger than Canada). But
size alone explains nothing in a world
generously endowed with big countries.
And air travel has made remoteness,
even in the most far-off places, a rel¬
ative word.

Inuvik, a village in Canada's far
northwest, 400 kilometres (350 miles)
within the Arctic Circle, is now an
important scientific community. Since
a government research station was
set up there nearly six years ago,
geologists, physicists, meteorologists
and ice-observers have been using
the north as a huge outdoor laboratory,
assembling data that will be used to
develop the arctic regions. Left,

and Yellowknife, are linked to southern
Canada by air service that ranges from
jets to the two-seaters used by pros¬
pectors and geologists. On northern
airfields or moored to a lakeside dock,
these bright-painted tough little planes
look frail as dragonflies.
If, on some winter days, when in
southern as well as northern Canada
planes are grounded and you cannot
reach the north, your voice still can.
Mass communications the Northern
Service of the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, telephone, telex, the bul¬
letins of the arctic weather stations
feed north and south in a continuous
two-way exchange.
It's a rare home in the north that
doesn't have a radio; the voice of the
CBC reaches Eskimo and Indian liste¬
ners in their own dialects. Northerners
like to talk and on radio everybody has
a chance to air their views and hear
what the other fellow is saying. If
city listeners grow bored with radio,
not so the isolated. Voices are a vital
human link not only between the north
and south but between widely scat¬
tered communities throughout the
north.
Yet for all the great contributions
of science and technology the north is
still inwardly and outwardly frontier
country, full of the style and spirit of
a region moving towards the status of
a province and impatient to achieve it.
A land where weather and distance
can be at their most formidable and
the individual whatever his race counts
heavily. He is himself; not a mere
digit of man in the mass. People from
other countries must find this frontier
quality attractive, too, because so
many of them are in the north.
Geography has created no set pat¬
tern for the land save its immense
size. The territories extend west to
east from the borders of Alaska to
the rocky east coast of Baffin Island
and north from the provincial bounda¬
ries to the continental limits of Canada
in the high arctic.
Within this rough triangle lies a jig¬
saw puzzle of mountains and tundra,
uncountable lakes and semi-deserts,

vast expanses of spongy muskeg, stark
out-croppings of ancient rock. A land¬
scape built from millions of years of
geological time.
The north is many things to many
different sorts of men.
To the mining executive it is an
area of potential wealth and high cost
operation. One man who is now
engaged on a major mining develop¬
ment 300 miles inside the Arctic Circle
has said, "In a remote northern loca¬
tion. . . the ordinary difficulties are
multiplied a thousand times." He was
referring here to the whole parapher¬
nalia of development from discovery to
markets. Yet all over the north the
work gets done. Obstacles are beaten
down or bent and twisted into oppor¬
tunities.
To the scientists working at the
government research station at Inuvik
in the western arctic, the north is a
huge outdoor laboratory where life
forms range from Nanook, the polar
bear, to delicate summer butterflies
and ferocious mosquitos. A region
where caribou, musk-ox, polar bear
and the sea mammals can be studied
as they move and drift among the
solitudes driven by urges older than
science. Where geologists, geo¬
graphers, physicists, meteorologists
and ice observers probe the secrets
of air, land and sea providing basic
data for northern development and
adding their knowledge to the pool
of world science.
In 1962, a year before the Inuvik
station was opened, the (then) Depart¬
ment of Northern Affairs and National
Resources initiated a Grants program¬
me to meet the need for more trained
scientists, to stimulate research in the
north and encourage Canadian univer¬

AN UNPARALLELED INTERNATIONAL SURVEY
Thousands of
stained-glass windows
from medieval times
0,FNE of the great trea¬
sures of man's cultural heritage are
the stained-glass windows of medieval
Europe. Yet for a long time few fields
In the history of art showed so many
gaps. Paradoxically, it was the
Second World War which made pos¬
sible the comprehensive study of
thousands of masterpieces in stained
glass. In war-threatened areas these
works were taken to safety and, often
for the first time, indexed and photo¬
graphed.
In 1949, Professor Hans R. Harm¬
loser of Bern (Switzerland) proposed
a country-by-country inventory of all
stained-glass windows made in Europe
between the twelfth and sixteenth cen¬
turies. Work on this Corpus Vitrea-
rum Med/7 Aevi, which is being carried
out with the collaboration of leading
specialists, will take no less than 20 to
30 years to complete. The Corpus
will comprise 75 large-format volumes
richly illustrated with black and white
and coloured plates, a few of which
are reproduced on our colour pages.
Unesco is supporting the project with
aid in publishing and research.
Seven volumes dealing with works
in Switzerland, France, Belgium,
Austria, the Federal Republic of Ger¬
many and Scandinavia have appeared
since 1956. Five (Belgium, France, Ger¬
many) are to appear shortly and a
further 23 are in preparation. Each
volume has a preface, an historical
introduction, a catalogue of stained-
glass windows for a particular monu¬
ment or period, as well as an incono-
graphic, historical, stylistic and technic¬
al study, and reproductions. Each
volume is prepared by a national com¬
mittee affiliated to a special group
created by the International Commitee
for the History of Art to co-ordinate
work on the Corpus. Professor Harm¬
loser is chairman of the editorial com¬
mittee.

Corpus Vitrearum is warranted by the
fact that, despite losses sustained
over the centuries, the surviving
stained-glass windows in Europe still
constitute an enormous wealth of
art treasures.
The development of the art of stain¬
ed glass was linked to the rise of
Gothic architecture and the construc¬
tion of more and more churches and
cathedrals from the 12th century
onwards. A mosaic of pieces of
glass, coloured and painted, then
mounted in a frame of lead, the stain¬
ed-glass window is a monumental form
of the painter's art. Its origin goes
back to antiquity and stained glass
work was already used in the early
Christian basilicas, but no important
composition older than the twelfth
century has come down to us.
Gothic architecture, with its many
bays and windows beneath vaults
soaring ever higher, made room in its
lightened structure for the medieval

SCOURGING THE MONEY CHANGERS.
A 14th-century Austrian stained glass window
depicting the New Testament story of Jesus
overturning the tables of the money changers
and scourging them from the temple. The
dramatic treatment of the scene places it as a
work by the Vienna school of glass painting.
The original site of the window is not known,
but the master glass painters of Lower Austria
may have executed it for a private chapel. The
work (47 cm. by 37 cm.; 18 in. by 14 in.) is now
in Austria's Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna.

COLLECTING THE MARKET TAX.
Superb stained glass adorns Tournai Cathedral
(Belgium) a building completed at the end of
the 13th-century. In the south apse of the
transept is an unusual group of secular scenes.
"The Privileges", as these five 15th-century
works are called, show the levying of tolls
on bridges and of taxes on weights and measures,
wine, beer and market stalls. In the window
shown, town officials collect taxes from the
market vendors. The realistic scenes were
composed by the master glass painter Arnoult
of Nimeguen, designer of many other windows
in the cathedral. But they were actually
painted by one of his colleagues who, since
his name has not come down to us, is
known as The Master of the Privileges.

STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS (Continued)
75 volumes, 30 years' work
glass window to expand. The Sainte
Chapelle In Paris, built by King
Louis IX between 1243 and 1248, is an
example par excellence of a building
that is no more than a masonry shell
supporting a huge area of stained
glass over 615 square metres (6,600
sq. ft.) set in windows reaching
15 metres (50ft.) in height.
These stained glass windows had
three functions: they admitted light to
the building; they provided a form of
decoration of incomparable richness
thanks to the play of natural light; they
set forth religious teaching in a way
that the people could readily under¬
stand, every window recounting one
or more stories from the Old or New
Testament, or from the Lives of the
Saints.
Little by little they also came to tell
of historical events and to depict epi¬
sodes of everyday life and work. This
religious and secular picture-teaching
constantly derived new vitality from
the style of the stained-glass artists,
while technical research led to the use
of more and more varied colours. The
art of stained glass steadily changed
and developed from the twelfth to the
fifteenth century.
The Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevl
will be the first complete study on
medieval European stained glass. The
opening volume of the "Germany"
series (15 volumes in all) was published
in 1958, and dealt with Swabian works
from 1200 to 1350. Two of the four
volumes planned for the "Switzer¬
land" series were published in 1956
and 1965. Volume I covers twelfth to
fourteenth-century windows and Vol¬
ume III those of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries (Volume II will
appear later).
The first volume of the "France"
series (which will number 25) appeared
in 1959; it deals exclusively with the
stained-glass windows of the Cathe¬
dral of Notre-Dame and the Sainte
Chapelle in Paris. The numerical im¬
portance of the French series is
explained by the wealth of stained
glass in France's cathedrals. At the
start of the Second World War,
50,000 square metres (540,000 sq.ft) of
stained-glass windows were removed
to safety and thus survived almost
unscathed; 150,000 panels were photo
graphed before being removed and
after restoration.
Volume I of the "Belgium" series
(three volumes) surveys the relatively
scanty survivals of the medieval
period proper (1200-1500), a result of
the wars and invasions that Belgium
has experienced. Stained glass was
very widely used in Belgium from the
twelfth century onwards, but most of
the surviving works date from the first
half of the sixteenth century. Two
volumes will be devoted to them.
The first volume of the "Austria"
series (four volumes) published in
1962 deals exclusively with stained
glass in the buildings of Vienna. In
the "Scandinavia" series (1964), one
volume covers the stained-glass win¬
dows of Denmark, Norway, Sweden
and Finland. Other series are plan¬
ned for Great Britain, Italy, Spain,
Poland, Czechoslovakia and the United
States (where many stained-glass win¬
dows are preserved in museums).
The Corpus makes a decisive con¬
tribution to the history of European art
and reveals the great currents of inter¬
national exchange that enriched the
art of stained glass.
Scenes and figures from
episodes in the New and Old
Testaments fill the five soaring
windows in the chancel of the
church of Saint Dionys at
Esslingen (Federal Republic
of Germany). Each window
has no less than 56 motifs.
Shown here is Judas
Maccabaeus, a well-preserved
example of late 13th or early
14th century stained glass.

LAUGHTER AND ENDURANCE
Well-springs of Czechoslovak literature
by Adolf Hoffmeister

ITERATURE Is like a river
which crosses the landscape of life,
reflecting the sky, the banks, the
bridges, the boats and fishermen.
Great literatures contain great rivers.
Dickens is the' Thames, Tolstoy the
Volga, Sholokhov the Don, Faulkner
the Mississippi. And the metaphor
could be taken still further. But who,
then, is the Loire, who the Seine, the
Garonne and the Rhône? Who is
the Elbe and the Moldau, the Danube
and the Vah ? Metaphors must not
be taken too far, after all. And yet
literatures are like rivers and poets
like their sources. They draw their
inspiration from a stream. They pro¬
vide the current. Sometimes, it is true,
there is nothing but water and this
water only evaporates with the lapse
of time.
In the centre of Europe, continually
threatened by invaders, the Czech and
Slovak peoples, realistic, hard-working,
heretical and inflexible, persist obsti¬
nately with their own truth and are
ready to brave every storm. Situated at
a crossroads of civilization, impelled
by centuries of oppression towards a
prudent wisdom, these peoples, with
their respect for reason, created a cul¬
ture which was also a protection.
They have persevered within their own
fortress while still maintaining contact
with the world. Czechoslovakia is a
small country which belongs to two
peoples, the Czechs and the Slovaks.
The importance of the art and lite¬
rature of this country is out of propor¬
tion both to the number of its inhabi-
ADOLF HOFFMEISTER was Czechoslova¬
kia's ambassador to France from 1949 to
1951 and since 1956 he has represented his
country at Unesco's General Conferences-
as delegate for cultural affairs. He is a
lawyer, writer, artist and cartoonist. For
several years he has been president of
the Pen Club in Czechoslovakia and has
taught drawing and animated cartoon
techniques at the High School for Applied
Arts in Prague. His numerous works,
written and illustrated, include memoirs,
travel journals and essays. He has also
written the libretto for a children's opera,

tants and to the extent of its territory
and even the general level of culture.
It goes far beyond these. Should this
be attributed to the beauty of the
landscape? Czechoslovakia is like
an orchard fertile in talent. We need
do no more than consider the number
of artists who have been born or grown
up in this country and whose work has
unquestionably enriched German cul¬
ture: Alfred Kubin, Robert Musil, Oscar
Kokoschka, Adolf Loos, Rainer Maria
Rilke, Sigmund Freud, Stefan Zweig,
Arnold Zweig, Franz Werfel, Franz
Kafka. This gives a ready indication
of the number of men of letters un
known because of their language who
belong to literature.
The anchor of certainty for each
writer lies in a profound patriotism
without the slightest trace of romanti¬
cism or nationalism, a patriotism muted
by an innate modesty. As an old, and
perhaps somewhat old-fashioned pro¬
verb has it, "The smaller the country,
the greater the love it needs." What
better proof could there be of this than
the fact that a relatively small country
has so rich and important a literature?
This people supported a heavy bur¬

stubborn good humour enabled them

to overcome the propagation of a
philosophy of destruction and despair.
Czechoslovak writers were all at
their posts when the bloody history of
our century was being written. The
wretchedness of their childhood and
the experience of an appallingly hard
life were their masters up to the day
when they looked on hell with their
own eyes: the occupation from 1939
to 1945.
In the twentieth century when Czech
and Slovak literature had to make up
a certain cultural leeway in compari¬
son to the outside world, readers stub¬
bornly rejected any superficial art.
And for the same reason, neither
pragmatism nor the cult of the com¬
monplace nor popular romanticism was
able to develop. Creative artistic
expression is closer to dramatic struc¬
ture. Writers are always impelled
towards concentrated expression by a
certain impatience and a certain inner
unease. The literary language itself,
enriched by the wisdom of the people,
excludes the slow epic pace of the
roman fleuve, or saga. Everything re¬
lates to action. When writers have
been brought painfully up against poli
tical reality they have stood fast.
The only element which softened
the angles and the sharp edges was
lyrical poesy. This is typically Slav
and goes hand in hand with the musi¬
cal genius of the people. A glance at
any anthology of Czech and Slovak
poetry will provide the proof.
Laughter and endurance in the face
of evil, such are the two main elements
in the national Czech and Slovak cha¬
racter. The Czechs and the Slovaks
are fundamentally gay. They are
devoid of complexes. They are
almost wholly unreserved, free of Nor¬
dic gloom or austere detachment. All
of them feel themselves to be at one
with their fellows. Social relationships,
like the country's artistic expression,
are stamped by the spirit of the people.
Folk songs and folk melodies run in
their blood: dances, sometimes boiste¬
rous, free their limbs. Simplicity of
design is innate in their plastic arts.
Thus, the whole people preserve the
memory of the national hero, Julius
Fucik. Before he was tortured to
death by the Nazis, he bequeathed to
Czech literature the most heartrending
of heroic documents "written under the
scaffold". It is this which contains
his supreme message, "Mankind, I
loved you! Keep vigil!"
None the less, all those who were
his close friends and who knew him
well, all those who lived with him at
a time when they formed a youthful
vanguard, remember a man of gaiety'
a human man, full of life, joy, love
and laughter. He had a tremendous
sense of humour.
Similarly, Vancura and Olbracht will
remain forever in the memory of the
people as happy men. They too had
never rejected the pleasures of life
and drank from their cupped hands
simple joy and belief in people. Marie
Majerova, eternally youthful, was like
them in accepting the same principles
dictated by the spirit of the people.
Gaiety is the distinguishing feature
of the Czech and Slovak national char¬
acter. It is the very form of their
human relations. It is the accent of
their speech. It is the underlying ele¬
ment In the old popular traditions. It
is the tone of the Czech and Slovak
tales and proverbs. It is the Czecho¬
slovak way of binding up wounds, of

Chichlkov and the Revizor, Tartuffe

Roi, Sam Weiler and so many others.
They are legion. But Schweik is the
only Czech in their ranks. And he
was able to take his place precisely
because he was so essentially of the
people, so Czech and so gay.

IT is not, however, only
gaiety which is involved. There are
two sides to the Czech coin the man
of feeling, the enthusiast, uses both
sides to pay his debt of life to mankind.
If one side is laughter, the other is the
harsh decision of battle. Czechoslo¬
vak literature has always embodied
leitmotivs of revolt and obstinacy shap¬
ed in the history of the country from
its beginnings. The heroes were John
Hus, the philosopher of the revolution¬
ary intellectual and social movement
which bears his name, and Janosik, the
Robin Hood of Slovakia, the symbol of
the struggle for social justice and
freedom. Literary content in this
sense combines serious reflection with
the shadow of the agonizing tradition
of intransigence in the face of evil.
Karel Capek, the apostle of state
democracy, who was, without realizing
it, one of the first writers of modern
science fiction in the 1920s, just as
Frantisek was one of the first abstract
painters and one of the most univer¬
sally recognized Czech writers, reach¬
ed the same philosophical concept
through his profound knowledge of
man, of the toiling individual and the
simple spirit.

ORPHANAGE FOR
WILD ANIMALS
by Richard Creenough
The refuge for wild animals
which opened three years ago
on the edge of the Nairobi National
Park (Kenya) quickly proved its
worth as an experiment in the
protection of African wildlife arid
natural resources. Each year
over 120,000 people visit this
animal orphanage and a small
admission charge has made it self
supporting. This young gazelle
was taken in when three weeks old.

A,IN unusual kind of orpha¬
nage is situated on the outskirts of
Kenya's capital at Nairobi. Open to
the public, it is a refuge and home for
wild animals whose parents either
were slaughtered by poachers seek¬
ing meat, skins or ivory; caught in
traps; killed in fights with other ani¬
mals; or died from natural causes. It
is believed to be unique although a
similar institution is to be established
in neighbouring Uganda.
Situated on the edge of Nairobi's
own 100-square kilometre (44-square
mile) National Park, and tiny by com¬
parison with most other parks in East
Africa, it was opened in 1964 with
eleven inmates. Its first guest was
a young and bewildered rhinoceros
Bruce, barely two-feet long and only
a few weeks old whose mother had
been killed and whose father's where¬
abouts were unknown. Bruce had to
be lured and coaxed into his new
home with handfuls of sugar cane. By
1965 there were about 130 guests,
representing some 40 different species
of animals and they were attracting
120,000 visitors a year.
"Most of our inmates are genuine
orphans found by the game wardens
in the neighbouring park," says
Mr. Mervyn Cowie, director of Natio¬
nal Parks in Kenya, whose pet inte¬
rest this orphanage has now become,
and who looks forward to expanding
it into a large national zoological and
botanical park "where Africans, espe
cially school children and teachers,
can come and learn about and appre¬
ciate the animals of their own country,
which, mostly, they have never or
rarely seen and have been brought
up only to fear or to kill."
When these young animal orphans
are found, and discovered to be too
small, weak or sick to feed or lock
after themselves, they go first to the
orphanage hospital and are cared for
or bottle-fed. This was the case with
another early guest, a baby hippo
only a few weeks old.
"We also had a leopard cub, whose
mother had died in a trap, and wno
had absolutely no coat at all. We
doctored on a new coat and now he
has as fine a set of spots as any

ORPHANAGE FOR WILD ANIMALS (Continued)
Weaned back to jungle ways
leopard in Africa," says Mr. Cowie.
"As they grow up, we slowly train
the animals to fend for themselves,
to hunt, to make their own way with
other wild animals at large, until even¬
tually they can be released back into
a game reservation."
This process of "weaning back into
the wild" must be gradual. After an
animal has reached a certain age
you can't just automatically turn him
loose and expect him to adjust to the
jungle law of wild life, as if he had
been there all along instead of being
under human care in almost domesti¬
cated surroundings, as Mr Cowie ex¬
plains. This is especially the case with
lion cubs who usually cannot be
released until they are about four
years old.
Part of this gradual process may
involve leaving an orphan's pen open
so that, if he wishes, he can wander
off to the game park and get used
to being with other animals, fending
for himself,' foraging for food and
generally learning to keep alert and
alive. But the orphan always knows
that the pen door is open and that
he can come back if need be.
But it is not only a matter of being
able to survive, hunt and forage
for food. After being brought up in
a more or less domesticated state,
some animals lose their immunity to
certain diseases, automatically acquir¬
ed in the wild state. They also lose a
sort of built-in sense of self-preser
vation that, for instance, warns wild
animals against eating infected food.
So, when they are released, animals
usually must be vaccinated against
certain diseases. Some of the cats,
mainly the cheetahs, become fat and
lazy in their easy life and find they
can't run fast enough to catch their
food. So they also come back, unable
to cope with the facts of wild life.
There have been baby elephants
in the orphanage, hippos, camels,
buffaloes, even two bears from a
travelling circus which was closed
down, wild dogs perhaps the rarest
species here at the moment for they
are in danger of dying out in Africa
all sorts of members of the cat family
such as leopards and cheetahs, bat-
eared foxes, porcupines, many species
of deer and antelope, a wart-hog, and
among the many various members of
the monkey tribe, Sebastian.
Sebastian is a four-year-old chim¬
panzee, about whom the phrase "as
clever as a monkey" could well have
been originally coined. He has all
sorts of open-air parlour tricks. He
genuinely seems to enjoy smoking
cigarettes, not only lighting them with
a match but chain smoking as well,
and he also likes his glass, even
bottle, of beer.
Given a number of keys on a key¬
ring, he can pick out the one which
will unlock his own collar and does
so. He is temperamental about came¬
ras. In general, he enjoys being pho-
A new arrival, this six-weeks-old cheetah is
now getting accustomed to humans. The most
rapid of hunting animals (up to 70 mph in
short dashes), the cheetah has difficulty in
readapting to freedom after a long stay in
almost domesticated surroundings. It tends
to get fat and lazy and finds it cannot run
fast enough to catch its food. Below, two
other guests of the zoo-orphanage: left,

tographed and poses willingly, as a
rule to the accompaniment of pierc¬
ing chimpanzee laughter, though he
has been known to react by turning
his back on a photographer. Yet,
sometimes if a camera comes too
close, he will snatch it, run off and
gleefully smash it to pieces.
Quite apart from the humanitarian
aspect, the orphanage serves many
other useful purposes. "First of all,
we can study animals in more or less
natural surroundings, learn about their
habits, diet and so on. Then we can
breed some of the rarer animals in
safety, such as the wild dog," says
Mr. Cowie. "We can also help fill
demands from zoos all over the world
needing fresh stock. This is satisfactory
in two complementary ways. It allows
animals that have got used to humans
to remain tame and not run the risks
in getting back to wild life, and it
obviates the need to capture fresh
wild animals, thus contributing to the
campaign for the preservation of
wild life."
Problems concerning the conserva¬
tion of the world's natural resources,
particularly its wildlife, have always
been one of Unesco's preoccupations.
Important developments have taken
place in Africa following an internatio¬
nal conference on the conservation of
nature and natural resources in mod¬
ern African States, convened by
Unesco at Arusha, Tanzania, nearly
six years ago. Unesco specialists
have been in Ethiopia, at that
country's invitation, advising on a
conservation programme following an
on-the-spot Investigation led by Sir
Julian Huxley two years earlier.
Moreover, Unesco has opened a
Regional Centre for Science and
Technology at Nairobi.
As a result of national campaigns,
largely primed by Unesco's work,
growing pressure is being brought to
bear by all African governments for
the preservation of their wild life, and
for action against the indiscriminate
poaching of game, particularly animals
threatened with extinction.
But a big problem is how to acquaint
Africans with the wild life of their
countries, especially those people who
live in towns. It is unsafe to visit game
parks except in cars, and most Afri¬
cans are without cars. "One of our
aims at the orphanage is to bring
Africans here who cannot afford to go
into parks", says Mr. Cowie. "That
is why the National Parks Adminis¬
tration has started organizing bus
expeditions to bring people espe¬
cially pupils and teachers from Nai¬
robi to see the orphanage and,
where possible, a bit of the game
park as well." An information service
has been set up and an exhibition
hall built next to the orphanage where
lectures are regularly given about the
wildlife of Kenya, in particular, and
of Africa in general.
"This important educational work
is another reason why many members
of the Kenya administration agree that
they would like to see the orphanage
expanded into a large zoological and
botanical park where people can learn
too about the flora and fauna, soil
conservation and the conservation of
wildlife," adds Mr. Cowie.
Already, he has promises of land
for such a park. And, if the success
of Kenya's wildlife orphanage now
self-supporting as a result of admis¬
sion fees is any indication, it should
not be long before Nairobi has its
new park complete with an enlarged
orphanage for, unhappily, the number
of new inmates is not dropping.

A CULTURE IN THE MAKING (Continued from page 9)
but, in every field, it has exerted a
powerful stimulus on individuals and
organisations.
The Stratford Festival Theatre, in
Ontario, the Winnipeg Ballet in Mani¬
toba, and La Comédie Canadienne
(under Gratien Gelinas) in Quebec
to cite but three examples have
attained reputations throughout all
Canada and beyond her borders.
Among authors, of whom there are
so many that any name can be no
more than an example, Hugh Mac-
Lennan, Gabrielle Roy and David
Walker have received international
acclaim.
This developing consciousness of
national identity, together with the
greater personal contacts among
Canadians from all parts of the
country, has, however, produced prob¬
lems that were less clearly discerned
when communities were isolated and
the tempo of life was slower.
One such problem is that of langua¬
ge. As already pointed out, although
both English and French are the
legally-established languages of Cana¬
da, most Canadians speak only one
of them. In Quebec, a lawyer or a
witness .appearing in the Courts of
Justice had the right to use either
language so that Quebec lawyers
were perforce bilingual but this was
not the case in other parts of Canada.
In the Parliament, at Ottawa, spea¬
kers may use either language but
French-speaking members who wanted
to influence their English-speaking
colleagues had to become bilingual
until simultaneous translation of the
debates was introduced a few years
ago. In essence, most of the work
of the Government of Canada and
most business operations were, until
yesterday, conducted in the English
language outside the Province of Que¬
bec. Only one university the Univer
sity of Ottawa was officially bilingual.
This situation has changed consi¬
derably during the past few years.
An increasing number of government
officials are today bilingual and busi¬
ness enterprises are recruiting increas¬
ing numbers of men and women who
have command of both languages.
Radio programmes in both languages
now span the continent and there is
some hope that, when a new genera¬
tion has emerged, Canada may become
in fact, as well as in theory, a bilingual
nation.
This year is a centenary. The
International Exhibition in Montreal
Expo 67 which owes so. much to
Jean Drapeau, the dynamic Mayor of
Montreal, will have much from other
countries to show to Canada. It will
also have much that is truly Canadian
to present to the rest of the world.
Canada has reason to be proud of
its cultural development.

ment Institute at Whitehorse and the
Arctic Institute of North America.
But science, vital though it is, is
only one segment of a total programme.
Engineers, town-planners, and adminis¬
trators who, once their spending esti¬
mates are approved by Parliament must
think immediately of getting their pro¬
grammes both onto and off the ground,
tend to regard life in the north in less
esoteric terms. To them and their
colleagues, the teachers, doctors, in¬
dustrial development officers and a
complex of connecting professions and
jobs, life is a day-to-day succession
of fronter rewards and setbacks. Var¬
iety and challenge, boredom and iso¬
lation, companionship and moments
of adventure northern service has
them all.
These are mainly the men and the
women who come from southern
Canada and whose present contribution
is vital. But the people who will count
most in the long run are the northern¬
ers; thosë'who were born in the north
or have made it their home; who have
roots in the present and a stake in the
future. With the movement of the
government of the Northwest Terri¬
tories into the north later this year a
pioneer step will be taken to bring the
Northwest Territories closer to the
day when it attains provincial status.
The Yukon is likely to achieve this
first.
T,HE Northwest Territories
adjoins the Yukon along its eastern
boundary and is all that its small, com¬
pact and homogenous neighbour is not.
Unlike the Yukon, which borders on
Alaska to the west and Is 520,000
square kilometres (202,000 square
miles) in area, the Northwest Territories
occupies 3,230,000 square kilometres
(1.25 million square miles) and is larger
than the combined area of six prov¬
inces. About 14,700 people live in the
Yukon and some 25,000 in the North¬
west Territories. All but about 200 of
the total Eskimo population of 12,500
live in the Northwest Territories and
arctic Quebec. The northern Indian
population of some 4,500 are settled
in both Territories in about equal
numbers.
In the past dozen years, the north
has been moving into the mainstream
of the Canadian future. From the
most northerly arctic weather station
on Ellesmere Island to the bustling,
well-settled, mining capitals of White-
horse and Yellowknife it is all very
much a part of contemporary Canada.
It is easy to write about the north in
segments but hard to describe it as a
whole. It Is too massive, too contra¬
dictory and there is too much going
on. As the Eskimo hunter remarked
after inspecting the first plane he had
ever seen on the ground, "This is a
bad thing to know just a little about."
But it draws you back and back to
learn more.
The education programme is as good
an example as any of how solid pro¬
gress can be so diffused over the
huge area it has to cover that it is
only when some fairly spectacular
stage of progress has been reached
that the peaks appear.
Throughout the north children of all
races go to school together. And no
segment of the government's total
northern commitment has been the
object of more effort and concern than
how to bring education to the children

Ways of life in the Arctic have changed over the last twenty years and
living standards have improved considerably. More and more

CANADA'S FAR NORTH (Continued)
Pre-university education
for all by 1971
of the north; all the children. And as
many adults as wish to have it.
A dozen years ago when the pro¬
gramme first got off the ground the
federal school system consisted of one
school In the arctic village of Tuktoyak¬
tuk north of Inuvik. Today there are 64
federal schools that range from two-
classroom schools in isolated commu¬
nities, where, all the children except
those of the teacher may be Eskimo, to
residential and vocational schools in
the larger centres where academic
studies can take qualified students to
university level or offer them a practical
trade and commercial training.
B
32
I Y January 1966, 7,000 chil¬
dren were in school approximately 85
per cent Eskimo children, 75 per cent
of Indian children and almost 100 per
cent of others of school age. During
the period July 1, 1964, to June 30, 1965,
91.2 per cent of northern children and
teenagers were in school.
Included in a total teaching staff
of 380 are specialists in northern cur¬
ricula. Theirs has been the early ex¬
perience, path-finding, experiment, trial
and error. Northern children are keen
learners and Eskimo children quicker
to pick up English than their teachers
to learn Eskimo. Strongly creative as
an ethnic group, Eskimo children de¬
light in the messy joys of finger paint¬
ing with bright colours on large sheets
of brown paper and modelling in clay
the birds and animals they watch their
fathers and older brothers carve in
soapstone.
Since radio reception in winter in the
more isolated communities is unreliable,
teachers rely on taped programmes
rather than live and use a great many
films, filmstrips and wall charts. By
1971, the education programme will
have reached the point where it is
providing a pre-university education
to standards as high as any in Canada.
The test of the programme's success
lies somewhere within the next ten
years. One criterion will be how many
qualified young northerners of all
races will be occupying positions and
holding down jobs now filled by Cana¬
dians from the south. How many Eski¬
mo and Indian teachers will be teaching
children of their own race? How many
young people will have made a suc¬
cess of the job of their choice if
they decide to leave the north and
try their luck elsewhere In Canada?
And so clear across the north through
almost the whole range of skills and
professions. The over-riding question
known to every planner, teacher and
vocational training expert associated
with the programme is how many jobs
will be waiting for these bright ones
when they are ready for them.
If you have seen a group of Eskimo
children or teenagers in school, you
will know with what zest they advance
on any opportunity to learn some new
thing that interests them. Particularly
any skill that can be expressed through
their hands drawing modelling, paint¬
ing.
It is not the Eskimo children that
teachers have to "sell" on school
attendance; it is their parents, some
of whom still do not approve of their
children being kept at a desk when
they could be out with their families
hunting or fishing or helping around
the house or the boat. The days of the
kayak have been succeeded by the
power-operated canoe and the Peter¬
head; both can move fast to the seal
and walrus hunting grounds and hunt¬
ing is a family affair.
I ANY who may know little
else about Canada have heard of
Eskimo art. By now the sculpture,
prints and fine crafts have been shown
in many world capitals where they have
had a great success. Those who
regret the passing of "primitive" carv¬
ing should remember that a vital art
does not live in the past, nor do artists
with something to say.
In May 1967, an Important collection
will be shown at the Galerie Iris Clert
in Paris.
Those who own. the art quite often
remark on the Eskimo's gift for con¬
veying so much in deceptively simple
lines. They ask how do the artists
achieve this feeling of strength? Do
they drive themselves hard? Do they
ever seem unsure of what the end
result will be? How do they work?
Most Eskimos seem to work in a
concentrated way, yet giving a feeling
of being relaxed about it, too. I mean
they give a sense of enjoying what they
are doing and not being anxious about
it, though, like all artists, they must
have their anxieties. Will this crude,
dusty lump of soapstone turn into the
shapes they wish it to? Will the
colours of a drawing, the texture of a
print, turn out right?
Perhaps they ask themselves these
questions. But the feeling I get about

GOOD-BYE
TO ISOLATION
Canada's once-isolated vast northern territories
(only 40,000 inhabitants, including 12,500 Eskimos
and 4,500 Indians) are today moving into the
mainstream of Canadian life. Ships may still
be trapped in the Arctic ice for months on
end (right), but communications are maintained
by planes and helicopters. If blizzards put
a stop to hunting, planes quickly drop supplies
of meat from reindeer herds maintained for
such emergencies by the government (below
right). Above, young Eskimo woman, elegant

people, works as a secretary in the civic

An art
of all seasons
them when they work is quietness, an
easy, concentrated strength. At Cape
Dorset and other talented communities
such as Povungnituk, Holman, and
Baker Lake, the artists enjoy their
success and the extra money, too. But
they don't get excited about it.
I remember noticing this quality of
quiet collectedness in Kananginak, one
of Dorset's best hunters and an excel¬
lent artist, when he came south to the
opening of a- new collection at which
his own and his wife's work were
represented. He received a good deal
of publicity but remained quite unruf¬
fled by it.
At one stage, when the opening was
over and a cocktail party was in full
swing, shrill and noisy, I asked Kanan¬
ginak if the noise bothered him. The
interpreter said something and they
both laughed, then the interpreter
replied, "Kananginak says the noise
does not bother him at all. It just
reminds him of standing below a cliff
of gulls when someone is raiding the
nests."

IN 1966 the Dorset group,
after three years of experiment, added
fabric design to sculpture and graphic
art and won one of Canada's National
Design Awards.
The colours capture the magic of
the arctic in summer, clear yellow,
mauve and blue of rock flowers, red
and orange of the midnight sun, the
soft greens of the lichens and Dorset
soapstone. Many are bird designs,
always a favorite with Eskimo artists.
Birds that fly, birds that walk, geese
that run when chased by a boy with
a stick.
Everything about this arctic land¬
scape, every changing season, every
creature that walks or swims or flies
is part of the Eskimo's life and there¬
fore of his art. So is that other
landscape where the spirits dwell.
A Canadian poet has written of the
arctic:
A land where all is space
And nothing time
Where today was tomorrow
And tomorrow will be yesterday.
And when you turn off your radio
and step out of your warm house and
walk alone on the tundra you find
that this is how the land still is.

In the craft centre at Cape Dorset, 2,000 kms
(1,200 miles) north of Montreal, Lutkak works on a
stone carving. Drawings and carvings by other
Eskimo artists decorate the studio.
ARTISTS OF THE TUNDRA
Though living a difficult nomad existence in a harsh
climate, the Eskimos of Canada have developed over the
centuries a unique art form, as ancient carvings excav¬
ated in Manitoba confirm. Today, as in the past, the
Eskimos carve in walrus tusk ivory, caribou antlers and
stone and draw designs on sealskin. They draw inspi¬
ration from their everyday life and ancient legends and
they recreate with consummate skill the forms of the
animals of the tundra which they hunt for food and cloth¬
ing. Some years ago, the Canadian Government set up
a craft centre at Cape Dorset (Baffin Land) where men
and women artists can create works that are becoming
increasingly known and appreciated around the world.

Sixteen secondary schools will be equipped,
15 others built and equipped together with
three agricultural training centres. Secon¬
dary education will thereby acquire 19,700
additional places more than 40% of
those included in the current Tunisian Four
Year Plan. The equipment of the sixteen
schools will provide 27,000 students with
a better and more firmly-based education.
Picasso in Moscow
A Picasso exhibition, which recently
took place at the Pushkin Museum in
Moscow, brought together some 200 works
from the Museum's own collection and
from individual collections, more especially
llya Ehrenburg's. Keen interest was shown
in the ceramics, many of which formed part
of a gift made to the U.S.S.R. by the
widow of the famous French painter, Fer¬
nand Léger.
Olive trees for Jordan
Nearly 1,800 hectares (4,450 acres) in
Jordan on the arid slopes near the Dead
Sea have been planted with olive trees and
vines under a programme conducted by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organ
ization. A new agreement between the
Jordanian Government and FAO will enable
3,600 hectares (8,900 acres) elsewhere in
the country to be planted with 36,000 olive
trees and 20,000 vines. The Jordanian Gov¬
ernment is to provide 500,000 dollars and
the World Food Prograame $1,2 million in
the form of food aid.
Gulf of Guinea resources
The International Co-operative Investig¬
ation of the Tropical Atlantic, co-ordinated
by the Unesco-sponsored Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission, has
established that the waters of the Gulf
of Guinea are particularly rich. There are
few places in the world where middle-
depth fauna come so close to the surface
in tropical low latitudes. This discovery
offers interesting economic possibilities:
the extensive fauna provide a "food
store" for such large fish as the tuna and
can also be exploited so as to open up
the possibility of a new type of fishing
industry.
Rats and men
Rats follow men and pick up the crumbs
that fall from their tables. It has been
observed that rats are multiplying at an
increasing rate; one which parallels the rate
of increase in urban populations. It is esti¬
mated that there were six times as many
rats in India in 1965 as there had been
in 1919. Traps and poisons are of little use
and it would seem that some biological
method would give better results. The more
food there is available, the more rats
multiply; but if food is consumed faster
by the rats than nature (or human careless¬
ness) replaces it, then the strong triumph
over the weak. Aggression moreover brings
about hormone changes in both categories
and these affect the reproductive mechanism
so that the rats' fertility declines. The only
problem is to see that the rats go hungry.
Electric town cars
Next year Great Britain will start produc¬
ing electric cars for town use at the rate
of 100 per week. These cars will be
equipped with four 12-volt batteries supply¬
ing a 5 h.p. engine with direct current.
They will operate over 100 kilometres
(62 miles) with 1 passenger and 64 kilo¬
metres (40 miles) with 4 passengers. The
electric car will weigh only 315 kilogrammes
(694 pounds), or one-third that of an ordi¬
nary car.
Figures for
a developing world
The third edition of the "Unesco Statistical Yearbook" has just been published (1).
It has been prepared by the Statistical Office with the co-operation of the national
commissions for Unesco and national statistical services, and the help of the
Statistical Office and the Population Branch of the United Nations.
The volume runs to 612 pages and contains fifty tables grouped under various
headings: population, education, libraries and museums, non-periodical publications,
newspapers and other periodicals, paper consumption, film, radio broadcasting
and television.
Over 200 countries and territories replied directly to Unesco questionnaires.
The 1965 edition of the Yearbook aims to give the most detailed figures possible
for 1964, 1963 and for 1950, 1955 and 1960 so as to establish a valid chronology
showing the quantitative variations in different fields.
Between 1950 and 1963, for example, overall world school enrolment rose by 69%,
57% at primary level, 110% at secondary level and 130% at higher level.
The number enrolled in African schools rose from 9,328,000 in 1950 to 26,205,000
in 1963, the equivalent figures for Asia being 72,201,000 and 137,147,000; for
America 50,441,000 and 92,091,000; and for Europe 56,966,000 and 77,358,000.
The tables for education give figures on the number of schools; the number of
teachers and pupils by sex and by level and type of education; students and
graduates at higher level by field of study; foreign students in higher education
(by field of study and country of origin). Educational expenditure is also covered.
In regard to book production, the Yearbook reveals, among other things, that
almost one book in ten is a translation since translations represent some 9%
of the world's output of books. English is the most frequently translated language
with 13.432 titles in 1964 against 10,804 in 1960, followed by French, Russian,
German, Italian, Czech and Spanish.
In 1964. the biggest consumer of newsprint was North America (7.9 million
tons out of a world total of 16 million); Europe followed with 4.5 million
and Africa came last with 170,000. In the same year there were approximately
231,000 cinemas in the world, representing a total seating capacity of 74 million,
5,100 television transmitters and 164 million receivers, and 16,100 radio transmitters
and 483 million receivers.

A tragedy
for Peruvian
culture
The earthquake which devastated the
district of Lima in Peru last October
destroyed 3,000 of the finest items among
the Peruvian antiquities of the Larco Her¬
rera Museum in Lima. The curator of the
Museum, Rafael Larco Hoyle, a distin¬
guished expert on Peruvian art, died a few
weeks later. On page 32 of last December's
issue, the Unesco Courier reproduced a
photograph of an outstanding item from
Rafael Larco Hoyle's collection a wooden
vessel of the Chavin culture carved in the
shape of an old woman's head. All admir¬
ers of pre-Columbian art will be saddened
by the loss of the unique collection of the
Larco Herrera Museum and the death of so
remarkable a scholar as Rafael Larco Hoyle.
World health
. The fourth five year plan of the World
Health Organization (work programme for
1967-1971) gives particular attention to the
needs of newly independent countries,
concentrating on sectors whose importance
is now generally recognized: adverse
reactions to pharmaceutical preparations,
the problem of micro-contaminants, radio¬
active residues, world population trends,
and communications science.
Desalted sea water
The largest plant in Europe for desalt¬
ing sea water is to be built at Las Palmas
in the Canary Islands. It will have an
output of 20,000 cubic metres (over
700,000 cubic feet), will have two evapor¬
ators of 10,000 cubic metres (350,000 cubic
feet) and will cost 450 million pesetas
(7,500,000 dollars). The cost price per
cubic metre will be approximately three to
four cents as compared to as much as
25 cents in other plants of this kind func¬
tioning elsewhere in the world.
Nuclear research
and Europe
The European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) centralizes and co¬
ordinates theoretical and experimental re¬
search carried out in Europe in the field
of high-energy physics, an advanced sci¬
ence concerned with the fundamental laws
governing the structure of matter in the
universe. The cost of CERN's basic
programme is covered by contributions
from the 13 Member States (Austria, Bel¬
gium, Denmark, France, Federal Republic
of Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom). Poland, Yugoslavia
and Turkey have the status of observers.
Practical co-operation with the U.S.S.R. has
been established over the last two years.
CERN and various Soviet laboratories have
exchanged staff and a series of Soviet
bubble chambers operated for several
months at CERN. The outstanding work
being done by Polish scientists on high
energy physics has been greatly facilitated
by active collaboration with CERN.
A directory of disasters
The natural disasters discussed in the
February issue of the Unesco Courier
along with many more are dealt with in
detail in Frank W. Lane's. "The Elements
Rage the extremes of natural violence",
just published by David and Charles,
Newton Abbot, Great Britain (50/-). This
richly illustrated volume is designed for
the general public and represents seven
years of research, writing and checking.
The very extensive bibliography indicates
the vast range of subjects treated:
hurricanes, tornadoes, waterspouts, hail,
avalanches, lightning, floods, meteoroids,
volcanoes.
DOUBLE ISSUE
Hereafter the double
issue of the Unesco
Courier will be dated
A u g u s t-September in¬
stead of July-August as
in the past.
Flashes...
Twenty doctors a year will be trained
at the hospital centre to be attached to
the University of Abidjan (Ivory Coast).
Scientific work (research and develop¬
ment) in the technically advanced countries
now occupies ten times as many people
as before the Second World War.
Excavations at Chatal Hoyuk in Anatolia
have revealed a neolithic city far older
than Jericho. Its pottery has been identified
as dating from 6800 B. C.
WHO announces that a major objective
the eradication of smallpox could be
achieved in 10 years at a cost of between
23 and 30 million dollars.
The Nehru memorial exhibition
A striking exhibition entitled "Jawaharlal Nehru: His Life and His India" was
inaugurated on March 10 at Unesco's H.Q. Sponsored by the Government of India,
the exhibition is presented in Paris under the joint auspices of the Indian Embassy,
the French Government and Unesco. It will be open to the public until April 7.
Twenty exhibits assembled from documents, photographs, objets d'art and
memorabilia, present a series of biographical sketches of India's great statesmen
against a vast canvas of history. The Nehru Memorial Exhibition has been shown
in London, New York, Washington and California, and will eventually return to a
permanent home in Delhi.

TWIN TOWNS FOR
UNDERSTANDING
Sir,
I have been a subscriber to your
magazine for two years past and
esteem it highly. Glancing over the
contents of those back issues I have,
seen nothing about the "twinning"
of towns for the purpose of bringing
people closer together. I am Vice-
President of the Tubize United Towns
Committee, and my home town has
recently been paired with Mirande
(France) and Korntal (Federal Republic
of Germany). Last August, Tubize
welcomed over 400 guests, both
French and German, all of whom
were accomodated by local residents.
I feel that the twin towns system could
provide you with valuable support in
the task you have set yourselves.
Marius Leonard
Tubize

THE COURIER AND PEACE
Sir,
I fully agree with the way in which
you present the world's problems. In
reading the Unesco Courier, I feel
that reasonable men, governments and
parliaments must everywhere be
aroused to preserve peace. Why not
begin by joining our efforts to ensure
well-being, eliminate hunger and
safeguard peace? I am certain that
through the Unesco Courier, which
might be published in even more
languages, Unesco could do much to
bring about friendly relations between
peoples. I am a Pole and my
countrymen believe that questions
relating to the preservation of peace
represent key elements in social
progress and welfare.
Jan Baranski
Lodz, Poland
PUPPETS, GAMES AND TOYS
Sir,
I agree with the suggestions
put forward by Mr. Shaw of
Australia (concerning puppets) and by
Mrs. Cotton of New Zealand
(concerning children's games and
toys) in the December 1966 issue.
As a teacher and as a grandmother,
I would greatly appreciate seeing one
of your issues devoted to these
subjects.
Thérèse Lapoulle

GENIUS IN THE POCKET
Sir,
I was delighted when the Unesco
Art Books pocket series first appeared
since I was at long last able to
become familiar with various little
known works of art, being one of the
thousands of those with a small
income who find no pleasure in cheap
literature. This impels me to ask
why Unesco does not consider doing
something similar with the Collection
of Representative Works so that,
through pocket books, a vast public
could make the acquaintance of
Soseki or Rustaveli (whom I dis¬
covered in your October issue) or
other writers of international impor¬
tance.
Paul Cornand

TWO ANTIQUE THEATRES
Sir,
In your interesting number on inter¬
national tourism (Dec. 1966), the an¬
tique theatre shown on page 15 which
you describe as that of Termessos is
in fact the ancient theatre of Side, a
coastal town some 70 Hometres
(45 miles) east of Antalaya rkey).
I visited Termessos in 1961 aii^. took
the attached photograph of its theatre
(above). It is smaller than the theatre
at Side and not as well preserved. At
Termessos, in the mountains north
west of Antalaya, no restoration work
had then been carried out. The thea¬
tre was difficult of access and I saw
very few visitors. Perhaps things are
different today.
Dr. Herbert Maler

TWO PROBLEMS AS ONE
Sir,
Your account in the January issue
concerning the Italian disaster was
most impressive. At the same time,
I feel advantage should have been
taken of this opportunity to show how
the vital problem of the protection of
nature and the problem of preserving
man's cultural heritage are in fact
linked since even to be aware of
them calls for the same kind of outlook.
Given the excessive increase in the
population, these problems are rapidly
becoming critical. The recent events
in Italy provide a brutal demonstration
of the degree to which a solution is
urgently needed. In my view, the key
to the matter is the uncontrolled flow
of water due to the lack of adequate
top-soil and plant cover in the
middle and high valleys, as was noted,
incidentally, in Professor .Tonini's
article. It is undoubtedly very difficult
to reconstitute a region devastated by
man's ignorance and cupidity but it
should be possible for Italy once
again to have forests worthy of the
name. The countryside could not but
benefit.
At the present time, small asso¬
ciations or groups with a limited
audience are alone in seeking to
alert the public to the dangers
inherent in various forms of human
activity which involve nibbling away,
often indiscriminately, at those ves¬
tiges of nature which remain more
or less intact. A publication like the
Unesco Courier has a duty to treat
the problem as being no less
important than archaeology and the
preservation of monuments.
Robert Schmal
Schiltigheim

ART FOR ART'S SAKE?
Sir,
A glance at the subjects selected
by the Unesco Courier indicates
that art is increasingly tending to
dominate your publication. For exam¬
ple, in connexion with the Florence
floods, the question of saving works
of art took priority over assistance to
the victims. I would add that the fact
of attaching so much importance to
ancient art certainly demonstrates a
belief in its value but also implies a
certain disregard for modern masters.
I do not deny that art should occupy
a place in our society but so should
such urgent and vital problems as la¬
bour and young people, the physic¬
ally handicapped, etc. The Unesco
Courier is not solely an art review
or an organ for defending ancient art.
I felt your January 1967 issue was too
restrictive and that something was
lacking.

JUNIOR 'COURIER'
AND JUNIOR U.N.
Sir,
I would like to support Mr. John
Roberts' suggestion (Unesco Cou¬
rier, October 1966) concerning a
"Junior Courier". It should be able
to compete with the numerous monthly
publications designed to attract
teenagers and it might be the organ
of a world-wide U.N. organization for
young people not just the usual
"Junior Groups" of the U.N.
Associations but a network of national
bodies (responsible to U.N. head¬
quarters), regional and local bodies.
All these bodies could undertake
community projects and help to make
teenagers realise that through service,
cooperation and the individual in the
community great things can be
accomplished.

GEESE
In Cape Dorset, a little village In Canada's far northern Baffin Land, lives
a remarkably talented group of Eskimo artists. The Arctic landscape and its
wild creatures are part of their life and of their art (see page 14).

fabric designs like this one by Anerglnik entitled "Fabulous Geese".
