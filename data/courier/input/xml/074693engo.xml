Many tropical and sub-tropical trees and shrubs produce the milky fluid latex from which rubber is extracted, but
almost all commercially produced rubber comes from the Hevea brasiliensis, a tree of South American origin.
Trees are tapped by making a shallow incision in the trunk from which the latex flows into a collection cup. Above,

MALAYSIA: Nursery maids
OURpurpose in devoting this issue of
the Unesco Courier to The World
of the Peasant is to draw attention
to a situation which, throughout the world,
is far from satisfactory. Almost every¬
where, more and more workers are leaving
the land, and, in many countries, notably in
the Third World, the conditions of those
who remain are seriously deteriorating.
In the industrialized countries,
mechanization of agriculture and the in¬
troduction of intensive farming methods
have necessitated a regrouping of
agricultural land and (except in the socialist
countries) heavyprivate capital investment.
In spite of accumulating enormous debts,
the smallfarmers have been unable to keep
up with these changes and have been oblig¬
ed to sell their lands and move to the towns.
The situation is somewhat different in the
Third World countries. There the peasants
are above all victims of the big trans¬
national agro-businesses which, guided
essentially by the laws ofprofit, control the
national and international markets and in¬
troduce monocultures and set in motion
"green revolutions" as they seefit. Millions
of small farmers have thus been forced to
move either to the urban agglomerations
where, crowded into shanty-towns, they are
reduced to the condition of a sub-
proletariat, or to the marginal lands of the
mountain slopes where, in their struggle to
eke out a bare subsistence, they have, in
spite of themselves, contributed to the
deforestation and erosion ofthe land and to
the spread of desertification. Nevertheless,
deforestation is in major part due to the
reckless exploitation of the forests by big
companies. In the countries of the Sahel,
desertification is becoming a catastrophe of
continental proportions. Thus, in many
parts of the globe, there are an increasing
number of disaster areas of which the
peasants are the primary victims.
This forced and ever increasing
uprooting of those who work on the land is
not only a human tragedy, it also involves
the irretrievable loss of the culture which is
their birthright. And this ancient and
precious culture must be preserved, indeed
developed, for it is still a vital force, as
witness the works being created today by
the peasants of Haiti, the Andean regions
and China.
The situation of the world's peasants will
improve when they are more fully in¬
tegrated, both economically and culturally,
into national life; when they have at their
disposal the scientific and technological
means to increase the yield of their lands;
when the problems of the disaster areas are
systematically tackled and the international
community devotes to them the necessary
efforts and resources; and, finally and
above all, the principles on which the
world's international markets are based are
altered to meet the imperatives of equity
and justice.

the market system, since they have to de¬
fend their pre-capitalist way of life while at
the same time seeking a just integration into
the national community. Even when they
share the misery of other needy country
folk, they do so with a much greater degree
of helplessness and have to face much
greater obstacles.
The fact is that, just as there is not one
but several Latin Americas, brothers but
different from each other, there is not a
single rural world. For the peasants and in¬
habitants of the countryside, the difference
in conditions of historical development
from country to country or from region to
region, is both qualitative and quantitative.
There is no dualism, no juxtaposition bet¬
ween two modes of production, two ways
of life, two cultures. There is, on the other
hand, a form of development that is both

EXCEPT for brief intense periods
during which they have occupied
the forefront of the national stage,
like lava which escapes through fissures in
the ground during an earthquake, the
peasants of Latin America have always
come last, have always been forgotten.
Nevertheless, it is on their shoulders that
the main brunt of the development effort
has always fallen. The economies of most
Latin American countries depend on the ex¬
port of farm products, and it is the produc¬
tion of basic consumer goods by them, in¬
cluding goods for their own consumption,
that makes it possible to sustain the living
standards of the continent's overgrown
modern cities. The backwardness in which
the rural areas and their inhabitants have
been kept and which is characteristic of a
certain type of economy and land tenure,
seriously restricts the expansion of the
domestic market, economic development
and the raising of the cultural, dietary and
material standards of Latin American
countries. It is an enormous historical in¬
justice and the source of much serious
social instability.
The peasants, who by definition are
isolated, scattered and trapped by local
living conditions, thus represent a burden
on the existing social structure of their
countries. This is why the searchlight of in¬
ternational public opinion has been focused
on them and why they are becoming a world
political force of primary importance which
the industrialized countries must take into
account in their calculations and in the for¬
mulation of their policies and strategies.
Hence the importance of keeping what hap¬
pens in the depths of this disorganized
human mass, which forms the bulk of the
population in many Latin American coun¬
tries, under constant observation. For this

reason also it is essential, if we are to
understand and foresee what may happen
in the future, to follow closely the main
trends which are agitating and transforming
the rural world.
For, to be precise, those concerned are in¬
habitants of the countryside rather than
peasants members of the indigenous
population in many countries; sometimes
co-tenants of the land; sometimes day-
labourers; sometimes landless peasants
without fixed employment; native or
mestizo artisans; small tradesmen who in
reality are needy unemployed peasants in
disguise; large families which are only part¬
ly involved in production as producers of
the manpower of the privileged classes.
Moreover, it is a rural world which varies
profoundly according to region, not only
between countries but also within each of
them. During good seasons, the peasants of
the Rio Negro or Unco valleys in Mendoza,
Argentina, used to sell their fruit crops at a
good price, buy a house, travel in Europe,
change their car, buy machinery. Now¬
adays, they give away their apples on the
streets of the cities which they invade with
their tractors.
The indigenous communities of Oaxaca
in Mexico react similarly to the direct ef¬
fects of the economic crisis on their lives,
defending their woods from the talamontes
who try to steal their timber, but there is a
cultural and social abyss between them and
the fruitgrowers of Argentina. The millions
of boias frias, the Brazilian day-labourers
who wait on the streets and market-places
of rural centres for someone to hire them if
only for a day, and who are defenceless,
without rights and any kind of organiza¬
tion, have very little in common with the
workers on the sugar plantations in the
north of Argentina, in Northern Peru, in
Mexico, who often own important pro¬
ducers' co-operatives which comprise the
land and factories and who are always
unionized and protected by the labour law.
The indigenous communities of Quiche In¬
dians in Guatemala, the Mexican sierras,
and the Andes mountain ranges have
special characteristics and problems which
distinguish them profoundly from the
mestizo peasants who are integrated into

unequal and linked. The so-called
economic, social and cultural marginaliza-
tion of vast numbers of human beings is an
intrinsic part of the particular kind of urban
industrial growth of the Latin American
region and of its integration, in the present
phase, into the world market.
This fragmentation of the Latin
American rural world does not, however,
exclude the existence of broad common
trends which are the immediate result of
"modernization", that is to say, the rapid
and ubiquitous penetration of the dominant
system of world production and the
transnationalization of the economy,
leading to common patterns of consump¬
tion and cultural models. Very broadly
speaking, and always bearing in mind that
different social fabrics offer varying
degrees of resistance to this modern
economic, political and social version of the
Procrustean bed, it is possible to discern a
number of common phenomena which are
changing the traditional characteristics of
Latin America. The most significant is
perhaps the demographic transformation.
Today, millions of needy peasants
wander through their countries, covering
thousands of kilometres in search of im¬
proved social conditions which are unat¬
tainable for them. Hundreds of thousands
of them cross national frontiers. Countries
like Paraguay and Uruguay have been vir¬
tually emptied of much of their active
labour force, of a decisive proportion of
their younger, more dynamic, more pro¬
ductive, . better trained people. The
capitalistic modernization of agriculture
acts in the Latin-American countryside like
a suction-propulsion bomb. It absorbs and
expels millions of people outwards towards
the cities, since the modern agro-industrial
enterprise needs a relatively- small labour
force and tends to maintain the small¬
holdings where the peasants live on their
own produce as reserves of seasonal
workers.
This migration of economic origin is
responsible for a veritable dissolution of the
old traditional type of agrarian society, and
is leading to the transformation of the
social, cultural and even physical environ¬
ment of the Latin American countries. But
in many of these countries, especially in
those of Central America, there is also
political migration. It is prompted and fed
by economic migration, but it also has its
own causes, dynamics and characteristics.
The insecurity in Guatemala, for example,
has forced a million people, i.e. one seventh

of the total population, to abandon their
homes and villages.
But the most typical feature of the new
Latin America is that it is ceasing to be a
rural continent. All of it is changing into an
area where, within a few years, the peasants
will be a minority. Even in Central
America, where the rural population still
forms 60 per cent of the total, cities are
growing at an annual rate of more than 5
per cent. Uncontrolled urban growth is
leading to "ruralization" of the cities, and
capitalistic modernization of rural areas,
which is being effected without the creation
of jobs corresponding to the changes, ab¬
sorbs and destroys the marginal lands,
violently transforms the natural and social
environment, polarizes the rural population
by creating a small sector of permanent
workers and a large mass of casual workers
or emigrants.
On the other hand, the transnationaliza-
tion of agriculture and the agro-food in¬
dustry has transformed countries which
traditionally produced and even exported
basic foodstuffs into importers of these
products, thus increasing their level of
dependence on the metropolitan countries,
who are no longer satisfied to export capital
and manufactured goods, but also export
agricultural products. Naturally, the im¬
portation of foodstuffs at lower prices than
those of the home product (thanks, in many
cases, to favourable tariff or credit policies)
deals a harsh blow to the stability of the
poor or moderately well-off peasant.
Moreover, the importation of finished pro¬
ducts as well as changes in taste imposed by
advertising which is also transnational,
leads to the replacement of locally produc¬
ed foods, such as manioc, cassava or
barley, by others which have to be paid for
in hard currency.

The prices of rural produce are declining,
ownership of land, of the means of produc¬
tion, and access to credit are being concen¬
trated in the hands of a few, rural
unemployment is spreading, large numbers
of indigenous peasants are being transform¬
ed into casual labourers in the coffee or
banana fields or on plantations owned by
big landowners or transnational com¬
panies. All this is creating great discontent
in the rural sector throughout Latin
America, irrespective of its level of develop¬
ment, ethnic origin, or culture.
At the same time, the enforced urbaniza¬
tion of millions of people is dramatically in¬
troducing the problem of the rural areas in¬
to the cities and putting an end to the
separation and historical confrontation bet¬
ween urban and rural dwellers, because the
former can no longer ignore the rest of the
country and the latter, who are being
transformed into a minority, cannot solve
their problems in isolation from their
fellow-citizens. So that, breaking out of
their traditional isolation, the peasants are
coming to depend upon national institu¬
tions and organizations of urban origin
such as the Church, the trade unions, and
the political parties, and this introduces
new problems and new social and political
forces into rural life.
At the same time, the birth rate is tending
to decline, but the death rate is declining
more. Life expectancy is increasing. The
level of education is also greatly improved,
so that the majority of the population is
now literate and better informed, especially
through the development of oral means of
communication, such as radio and even
television, which now reach the most
remote corners of the countryside.
This new cultural level and new capacity
to form judgments. are combined with a
critical economic situation and render in¬
tolerable political situations which were
previously contemplated with fatalism or
resignation. Obviously, this demand for
participation and democracy clashes with
the "modernization" of agriculture, which
grants less and less importance to the rural
vote and even undermines the basis of rural
populism. The paradox of development in
Latin America lies in the fact that this
development is not identified simply with
economic growth and that the powerful
forces interested in maintaining the present
social structure are working hard for a
change in the economy which cannot fail to
have profound political and social con¬
sequences. We are witnessing the disap¬
pearance of the old rural world (which will
survive only in pockets for use by
"modern" agriculture or will change com¬
pletely) and the birth of a new Latin
America.

What future
for Africa's silent majority?

Village near Mbout. southern Mauritania.
E know that we are pea¬
sants; we know that birds
don't all fly at the same
height. We don't want to be like the rich
people in the city. We want a better life and
a better living."
To assess the full significance of this
remark made by an old man of Piala, a
remote village in the vast Sahel, it must be
remembered that in spite of headlong and
anarchic urban growth, often with alarming
consequences, Africa is still overwhelming¬
ly a continent of peasants. The latter con¬
stitute an entire people which the informa¬
tion media, generally monopolized by rul¬
ing parties, scarcely discuss except when
forced to do so by natural catastrophes or
international pressures.
What do people in the big cities actually
know about the living conditions, dif¬
ficulties and aspirations of the millions of
Africans who are reduced to impotent
silence? In an Africa where the big capital
cities are a raging sickness, are the peasants
a fringe population destined to find at the
end of their migration to the city a life of
unemployment and poverty in the pro¬
liferating shanty-towns? Are the peasants
of Africa a marginalized peopleor are
they on the march?
It is true that the situation differs from
country to country, in accordance with dif¬
ferences in climate, levels of development,
and political régime. However, one obser¬
vation must be made: it is not certain that
the conditions of African peasants have
been improved by the advent of new States.
For many men and women, perhaps the
situation is worse than before. The suns of
independence do not shine for the people of
the bushsuch is the mute message which
is constantly repeated in different regions
and which comes from down below, from
villages where the peasants feel that they are
living as veritable pariahs on their own
land.
The malaise of the peasantry is striking in
countries where development is concen¬
trated in a single big city. The metropolis
with its ultra-modern quarters is the centre
of power and money, while the frustrations
of the poor turn into bitterness since the
development of an élite rests on the over-
exploitation of the work of the peasant. It
is not hard to imagine the social upheavals
caused by the irruption of capital into rural
areas in countries which appear to investors
as a fiscal paradise. Many peasants,
depressed into "absolute poverty" are
forced to work as labourers in the rice- fields
or on the cotton or sugar plantations. Many
have been dispossessed of their land when
major agro-industrial projects were put into
operation.
A visitor may be surprised by the state of
deprivation in African villages which have
been subjected for generations to the single-
crop cultivation of cocoa, coffee, cotton, or

tea. While exports increase, the peasants
sink more deeply into poverty and famine.
An article in the magazine Dialogue points
out that the peasants in Rwanda are the vic¬
tims of a form of exploitation resulting
from the industrialized cultivation of ex¬
port crops. Tea appears as a crop with
ruinous consequences falling mainly on the
"villagers."
There is no need here to go deeply into
the question of the dictatorship of ground¬
nuts in Senegal or of cotton in Chad. What
is claimed to be the "modernization" of
agriculture is tantamount to a systematic
disparagement of peasant systems of farm¬
ing, and leads to a kind of structured in¬
coherence which encourages the cultivation
of export crops to the detriment of food
crops, thus aggravating the inequalities bet¬
ween the industrialized countries and
Africa.
As Philippe Hugon has noted, "the
growing inequality in income distribution
shows up as an impoverishment of the rural
masses (...). A privileged group enjoys an
income more than a hundred times greater
than that of the rural masses (...). The pea¬
sant has an annual income which remains
constant, while he finances State expen¬
diture to a greater and greater extent.
Change is leading to a pauperization of the
rural mass."
A group of young Cameroonians who
camped among the peasants in the Yoko
area, some 100 kilometres from the capital,
had some interesting things to say about
their experiences. What struck them first
were the bottlenecks and breakdowns of a
dependent agriculture which is incapable of
meeting the needs of a balanced diet and
providing hygienic living conditions. "I
asked what they grew. They said that their
main crops used to be manioc, cucumbers,
groundnuts and maize, and that 'you can't
eat cacao and coffee'." Another student
noted, "They go off to the fields very early
and only return in the evening."
"Sometimes the peasants go to work
without having eaten. We never had
breakfast all the time we were in the village.
Like the peasants we were hungry when we
went off to work in the morning." This
allusion to severe hunger accurately reflects
the conditions of the peasants in these areas
where, furthermore, the health situation is
deplorable.
A revelation to people who know nothing
about life in the bush, the difficulties of sur¬
viving in stricken regions gave rise to the
following comments from the city students:
"This experience gave me an opportunity to
discover the facts," said one. Another
noted, "We are discovering the hidden
peoples who are not mentioned in the
schoolbooks." This aspersion cast at school
learning also goes for the information
media in general, as well as high-sounding
and delusory lists of achievements: "At last
we are finding out together the true facts
about the country which are concealed
behind speeches and the lies of the mass
media."
This Africa of villages exposed to the
perverse effects of models of development
which lead nowhere is Africa in all its
authenticity. Among the urban élites, what
Albert Tévoédjéré has denounced as the
"madness of mimetism" has bred needs
and desires linked to a Western-style way of
life. These needs must be paid for, which
means currency, which means taxes, the
proceeds of which benefit a rich men's club.
By becoming part of the monetary system,
the peasants set out on the road to pro¬
letarizaron, and a small privileged group
reaps the benefits. At a time when the rich
nations are constantly tugging at the rope
which is ' strangling Africa, the black
peasants may be the real forgotten ones of
the earth, their future a challenge to all who
seek a more equitable and more human
world.
After the disenchantment of the decades
of independence, many peasants tend to
believe that changes in their lives will not
necessarily come from above. The future is
being explored in experimentation with
development alternatives, starting with ac¬
tion in which the groups themselves become
the architects of change in their own en¬
vironment. We have been able to measure
the importance of these factors among the
peasants of north Cameroon, in a region
where the problems of land, water, and
millet exist in acute form.
For populations in search of land to pro¬
vide them with a living, the delusions of
rural organization appear when peasants
cannot be sure of keeping fields they rent on
a yearly basis from the traditional village
notables. How can you think of using new
farming methods if at any moment you may
find yourself dispossessed of your land by
officials who, when embarking on the
"Green Revolution", have a tendency to
confiscate land where cultivation is possi¬
ble? Encouraging the peasants to act begins
by motivating them to break out of
deadlocked situations. In regions threaten¬
ed by food shortages the first stage in the
process may be taking stock of the land
problems which condition the integration
of young people into the rural environment,
the health of the people, the education of
children, the equilibrium of the family, and
nutrition problems.
Such a project calls for an exchange of
views between those involved in the dif¬
ferent sectors of the development process

who often work in isolation, each keeping
to his own special field, without taking ac¬
count of the solidarity which is necessary.
Since there is no point in learning how to be
a better farmer if you have no land or if you
have no control over what you produce, it
is vitally important to encourage the
peasants to state their fundamental
problems, work out solutions to them, and
decide what action to take. For peasants left
to languish in ignorance by an elitist school
system, the experience of learning to read
and write according to an approach which
is based on the African oral tradition and
which encourages the learner to become
more aware of the world around him pro¬
vides tools of thought and a means of
emerging from captivity. Thus it is possible
to achieve literacy by assuming responsibili¬
ty for family, health or nutrition problems.
At the same time, learning to read makes it
possible to cope with the cotton markets
where illiterate peasants are cheated by
weighers and buyers.
The goal of these operations is to further
the kind of development in which the millet
granary, which conflicts with an exterioriz¬
ed model of agriculture leading to starva¬
tion and the marginalization of the peasant
world, again becomes part of family life. In
villages where cotton is king, to concentrate
farmers' attention on the millet granary is
to meet a basic need "food first". The
point is not only to make sure that they do
not die of starvation, but also to resist the
speculation of which the peasants are vic¬
tims during transitional periods when food
products, bought at low prices at harvest
time, are sold back to them at high prices by
dishonest dealers.
African peasant women sometimes work
until immediately before giving birth to
their children, and the overwhelming
demands on their time only leave them few
opportunities for rest and leisure. Any ar¬
rangement which enables them to speak out
about the problems of village life finds a
place in a global project for the transforma¬
tion of living conditions.
It is essential that women should be able
to express their opinions about the use of
crops and money, just as they are necessari¬
ly concerned by the invasion of capital into
rural life caused by the development of ex¬
port crops which aggravate food problems
in a region in which most children suffer
from malnutrition.
Consequently the women, who bear the
responsibility for the health of the children,
are asked to give their opinions on the ques¬
tion of the land where cotton drives out
millet. All the social forces in the village
should take part in a coherent alternative
development project. And so efforts are
concentrated on the young schoolchildren.
Through meetings where ideas are aired
and exchanged, the schoolchildren gradual¬
ly learn to become "the eyes of the village"
and to act in defence of the peasants. "Get¬
ting people to understand the use of
hygiene", "advising mothers to feed their
children well", "diversifying the diet",
"teaching people how to obtain drinking
water", "informing parents about the
country's problems", "shielding the
peasants on the cotton markets" these are
some of the responsibilities discovered by
young people when they reflect on the
solidarity between pupils and peasants.
The "school without walls" project, with
which 1 am concerned, reflects this desire to
re-examine the content of teaching in the
light of village questions in which the child
may be a factor of change. In spite of such
institutional constraints as timetables and
examinations, the aim is to throw open the
school to village families and communities
so that the teachers themselves, after being
initiated to social and economic conditions,
can stimulate awareness of their
environment.
The awakening of the village should be
rethought and should be focused on school
problems, for as a peasant at Tokombéré
told me, " a village without a school is a
village of slaves." We are faced with the
problem of a genuine peasant movement
which needs a certain number of tools to
free itself from the constraints which hinder
its progress. How can the power which the
"professionals" of development tend to
confiscate be returned to the villages?
Of course difficulties abound in this
shoulder-to-shoulder struggle at the side of
the proletarianized rural people. The
sacralization of customary or adminis¬
trative powers may paralyze all innovations
in villages where the power of the "chief"
acts as a brake on endogenous develop¬
ment. What can be done when the tradi¬
tional authorities demand taxes between

moted in a situation in which "rural
development" continues to embody the
harsh and unacknowledged reality of
peasant over-exploitation to the profit of
certain private interests.
Today methods are no longer exactly the
same, and the balance of power has chang¬
ed appearance. Forms of peasant resistance
in colonialized Africa brought to light a
community dynamic unsuspected in a conti¬
nent subjected for centuries to violent
exploitation.
Throughout the continent, groups of
people are forming at grassroots level. They
are the focus of a kind of "revolution
without tom-toms" which is mirrored in
peasant struggles and which is conditioning
the transformation of conditions of health
and human settlements, the organization of
agricultural production, the promotion of
women, nutrition and the management of
community affairs, relations between
young and oldin short, the defence of the
rights of the peasants.
If the circle of development in
dependence which leads to the development
o/dependence is to be broken, the peasants'
creative powers must be returned to them
by making the village community the
matrix of a new society. The village associa¬
tion appears to be an indispensable institu¬
tion in this context, as long as it is borne in
mind that the African tradition is not im¬
mune to contradictions and conflicting in¬
terests. Experience shows that many rural
groups have ceased to exist as a result of
their inner contradictions. To consider a
return to what is called the pre-colonial
community spirit as a miracle solution may
be to nurture dangerous illusions, not only
by dissimulating the inequalities and con¬
flicts which are inherent in any social situa¬
tion but by masking various forms of
domination and confiscation of power to
the profit of a privileged minority.
There is nothing automatic about the for¬
ward march of peasant communities. There
must be a constant process of research and
reflection on the condition of local com¬
munities, whose interests are not necessarily
those of the regional, national or interna¬
tional environment. To contest in practical
terms the adoption of the Western model of
development is to confront the central
authorities and the forces of money.
Through the struggles of the peasants and
their capacity to organize themselves, a new
way of existing in the world is being sought
along these lines.
As long as the peasants of Africa are
silent, humanity will be the less reduced
by an essential part of itself. Change is
necessary and it must come as a result of
small steps towards liberation. We have all
set out on a long road towards the eradica¬
tion of poverty and the emergence of an
African man liberated from renewed forms
of colonial exploitation. The words of an
old African sage, Amadou Hampaté Ba,
come irresistibly to mind: "Don't believe
for a moment," he said, "that the task is
too great and that our efforts are derisory.
There is no such thing as useless effort. In
the beginning, the baobab seed is no bigger
than a coffee grain. And yet from it grows
a sturdy and majestic tree whose shade is
beneficial to everyone."

A village
called Nanpur
by Prafulla Mohanti
THE name of my village is Nanpur. It
is one of India's 500,000 villages
and stands on the bank of the river
Birupa in the Cuttack district of Orissa. It
PRAFULLA MOHANTI was born and brought
up in Nanpur, the Indian village he describes in
this article. He won a scholarship to study archi¬
tecture in Bombay andfrom there went to England
in 1960 to work as an architect. He is now a pain¬
ter and writer. His paintings have been shown in
many parts of the world, including Europe, the
US and Japan, as well as India. He is the author
of My Village, My Life, a portrait of his village
which has been translated into Japanese, Nor¬
wegian and Danish. His film, My Village, My
Life, was shown on BBC TV during the 1982 Fes¬

is part of a group of villages with a central
market place at Balichandrapur, three
kilometres away, where there is now a
bank, a police station and a post office. The
village is connected by road with Cuttack,
48 kilometres south-west, the commercial
centre of the State.
Nanpur has a population of about 3,000
living in six settlements separated by mango
groves and paddy fields. Each settlement is
inhabited by one particular caste. Caste is
the most important feature. It defines a per¬
son's place in the village and the work he is
expected to do. One is born into a caste and
it cannot be changed.

iV Traditionally there are four castes-
Brahmins, the priests; Kshatriyas, the war¬
riors; Vaishyas, the businessmen; and
Sudras, the servant caste. But over the years
there have been many sub-castes relating
to professions. There are Brahmins,
Karans the administrators farmers, bar¬
bers, astrologers and Harijans, formerly
called Untouchables. The villagers are
mainly farmers and craftsmen. Each craft is
the property of a particular caste and
together they form the village community.
The villagers of Nanpur are Hindus.
They are religious. They believe in God and
his many incarnations. For them He is
everywhere, in a man, in a tree, in a stone.
According to Arjun Satpathi, the village
Brahmin, God is light and energy, like the
electric current. To him there is no dif¬
ference between the gods of the Hindus,
Muslims and Christians. Only the names
are different.
Every village has a local deity. In Nanpur
it is a piece of stone in the shape of a shiva
Ungarn. He is called Mahlia Buddha. He sits
under the ancient varuna tree protecting the
village. Kanhai Barik, the village barber, is
the attendant to the deity. Kanhai, before
starting his daily work, washes the deity,
decorates it with vermilion and flowers and
offers food given by the villagers. Clay
animals are presented. It is believed that the
deity rides them during the night and goes
from place to place guarding the village.
Mahlia Buddha was donated to the village
by the barber's great-great-great-
grandmother, so only his family has the
right to attend to the deity. In the old days
Mahlia Buddha had a special power to cure
smallpox and cholera. Now, although
modern medicines have brought the
epidemics under control, the power of the
deity has not diminished. People believe in
him and worship him for everything, even
for modern medicines to be effective.
Religious festivals provide entertain¬
ment. There is one almost every month. The
most enjoyable is the Spring festival of Holi
when people throw coloured powder and
water on each other as an expression of
love. As the cuckoo sings, hidden among
the mango blossoms, the villagers carry
Gopinath (Krishna) in a palanquin around
the village accompanied by musicians.
There is no television, but some villagers
have radios. Listening to film music is
popular. Snake charmers, acrobats, pup¬
peteers and wandering singers come visiting
during the dry season. A wave of excite¬
ment goes through the children when they
arrive.
Every villager has a jatak (horoscope)
which is also the birth certificate inscribed
on a palm leaf by Dharani Naik, the village
astrologer. He is consulted for
everythingif the planets are favourable
and the auspicious days for starting a
journey. There is a saying in Oriya, "Tues¬
day night, Wednesday morning, wherever
you go you receive good luck".
People believe in karma (fate) and the
12
cycle of rebirth. This helps them to accept
their situation. Padan is the only dwarf in
the village and is popular, despite his
disability. He is twenty-seven and runs a tea
stall in the market place. He recently mar¬
ried another dwarf from a distant village.
Padan believes he is a dwarf in this life
because of his actions in a previous
incarnation.
The houses are built of mud walls and
thatched roofs with a central courtyard
which is private and provides shelter from
the sun. Every house has an altar with a
tulashi plant (sacred basil). This herb is so
valuable for its medicinal properties that it
is worshipped as a goddess.
The villagers decorate the walls and
floors of their houses with rice paste for
festivals and ceremonies. The lotus is the
main symbol. At the harvest festival it is
painted with stylized footprints to welcome
Lakshmi, the Goddess of Wealth.
Marriages are arranged by parents and
the bride and bridegroom must belong to
the same caste. The horoscopes are shown
to the astrologer, who draws diagrams and
forecasts their compatibility. The girl's
father has to give a dowry, although it is
forbidden by law. The bride must be a
virgin.
The role of a woman in Nanpur is that of
a mother. A house is not a home without a
child. People live in joint families and fami¬
ly life is strong. She has the responsibility of
managing the household. If she does it well
.and brings prosperity, she is compared with
Lakshmi, but if she destroys its unity she is
compared to Kali, the Goddess of Destruc¬
tion. But her duty is not complete until she
has produced a son, essential for the family
to continue.
The women in Nanpur worship Satyapir,
a Hindu-Muslim god, to bless them with
sons. "Satya" is the Hindu part meaning
"truth", and "pir" in Islam means "pro¬
phet". It was a deliberate attempt to bring
the two communities together through
religion. There is a large Muslim settlement
three kilometres from Nanpur and in a
village on the other side of the river a single
Muslim family lives surrounded by
Brahmins. In spite of Hindu-Muslim ten-

sions in other parts of India, the at¬
mosphere around the village has remained
peaceful.
A woman without a husband has no place
in the village. Widows are not allowed to re¬
marry. They lead very austere lives. When
their husbands die they break their glass
bangles and stop wearing the vermilion spot
on their foreheads. The attitude of the other
women makes them feel isolated. They are
not invited to take part in auspicious
ceremonies as it is considered they may
bring bad luck.
There is a great respect for education.
Children start going to school at the age of
four. This begins at the chatshali, the
nursery school, which is run by a villager on
his verandah. I remember my first day. I
took a plate containing rice, a coconut and
money and presented it to the teacher. He
blessed me by gently stroking my out¬
stretched hands with his cane. Then he took
my hand and with a piece of clay chalk
helped me to draw three circles on the mud
floor. They are Brahma, Vishnu and
Maheswar, the Hindu Trinity. Brahma, the
Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and
Maheswar, the Destroyer. The Oriya script
is round and practising these circles helps to
develop good handwriting. The children are
told stories to form their character to be
kind, noble and hospitable.
In my childhood there was no primary
school in Nanpur and I walked to the ad¬
joining village of Kusupur, over a mile
away. Now the villagers have built one
themselves without any government help.
The market plac
The school starts with a prayei acknowledg¬
ing the presence of God in nature. The
children sing, "Why should I be afraid of
telling the truth? Even if I have to die, I
must tell the truth. O God, please teach me
this. I need nothing else."
The villagers also built a high school at
Kusupur and the children took part in the

e in Nanpur.
construction of the building. A private col¬
lege has started in Balichandrapur.
The aim of education is to get an office
job, to work as a clerk sitting comfortably
under a fan. The system goes back to the
days of the British Raj. There is no
guidance for the choice of a career and there
is no social welfare scheme in India. Several
highly-educated young men sit at home do¬
ing nothing and become a burden to their
families.
The dignity of labour is not understood.
The educated feel it is inferior to do manual
work. A typical example is Rabi Jena, the
young son of a Harijan. His father has no
land and worked hard as a tenant farmer to
educate him. But he was unable to pass his
matriculation exam. He was desperately in
search of a job and a friend offered him one
at an officers' club in the steel town of
Rourkela. He worked as an attendant and
at times was required to clean dishes and
serve tea. He refused and left as he con¬
sidered it beneath his dignity. He is looking
for another job but there is mass unemploy¬
ment everywhere.
The staple food for the villagers is rice.
The poor eat it with spinach and the better-
off with dal, vegetables and fish, caught in
the local rivers and ponds. Occasionally
goat meat is eaten but it is a luxury. Eating
beef is unthinkable for a Hindu as cattle are
considered sacred. The cow is called "cow
mother" because the children drink her
milk, and the bull is holy because Lord
Shiva rides on him. Only oxen are used for
ploughing the fields and pulling carts.
The main crop is paddy (rice). It is
planted in June, just before the monsoon
and takes four months to grow. It is
harvested in November. A successful crop

brings happiness to the village.
There is no hospital in the village and the
nearest health centre is four miles away.
There is no ambulance service and patients
have to be carried there, whatever their con¬
dition. The consultation is free, but the
villagers have to buy their own medicines,
which are expensive. People complain that
they have to spend half a day to get only a
piece of paper, the prescription.
Young doctors are reluctant to work in
the villages because there is no money. But
Basant Jena is an exception. He is from
Cuttack, the nearest town. One had to walk
20 kilometres to the railway station and
there were two rivers to cross by boat. With
only two trains a day, if you missed one
there was a wait of twelve hours for the
next. But in 1968 a motor road cut across
the village to carry iron ore to the port of
Paradip, 96 kilometres away. For the first
time travel was made easy and the village
was connected with the outside world. But
the road has brought noise and pollution. I
am amazed how the villagers have got used
to it. When I was a child there was no noise
apart from the barking of a dog or the
I wanted to be a doctor to help the village
but could not get into medical school. By
chance I won a scholarship to study ar¬
chitecture in Bombay. That changed my
life.
The village has also changed. Electricity
has come. Epidemics are under control, but
there is no proper water supply or sanita¬
tion. Education has helped to break down
caste barriers. The member of parliament
for my village is a Harijan. Family sizes
have increased but food production has not
kept pace with it. Floods, droughts and
cyclones occur every year, causing suffering

Nanpur and after qualifying as a doctor
opened a surgery at Balichandrapur. He is
overwhelmed with the problems. He treats
hundreds of patients daily but feels
helpless. The illnesses are caused by pover¬
ty, which cannot be cured by medicines.
Many villagers turn to the quacks, who
combine modern medicines with
homeopathy and herbal remedies. Anyone
with a little knowledge can practise as a doc¬
tor and modern drugs are freely available
without prescription.
In my childhood the village was totally
isolated. It took one whole day to reach

noise was produced by the rhythmic
pounding of rice. That worried me when I
was preparing for my matriculation exams.
I told my mother and the pounding of the
rice stopped in my part of the village so that
I could concentrate on my studies.
Out of my twenty childhood friends, two
died of cholera, one died of typhoid, three
were disfigured by smallpox, five girls got
married and left the village, six boys went to
towns to find work. Only three stayed in the
village; one is unemployed and the other
two work as farmers.
and malnutrition. This year all three have
occurred in succession and the people who
were able to smile only last year have turned
into skeletons.
But in spite of poverty and suffering
there is a strong desire to survive and the
villagers have a natural dignity. Although
they feel a part of nature they know they
have no control over it. Acceptance brings
contentment.
Once I leave the village I want to go back
to it, its love, beauty and simplicity. Often
I wonder what will happen to it.

Cobs of maize dry in the sun at Kunning in China's Yunan province. In southwestern China maize
is an important crop grown on dry and unterraced lands.
The changing pattern
of Chinese agriculture
by Ma Shiyu
WITH her vast territory (9,560,500
square kilometres) and enor¬
mous human resources, China
has a long tradition of intensive farming.
More than 800 million of her total popula¬
tion of over one billion work on the land,
and this abundance of labour has meant
that mechanization of agriculture has pro¬
ceeded- cautiously.
In recent years new trends have emerged.
New rural policies adopted in 1979 have
resulted in modernization based on diver¬
sified development of agriculture, animal
husbandry, fisheries and sideline enter¬
prises which produce basic goods such as
bricks, bottles and low-cost clothing and
employ about 30 million rural workers.
Perhaps the most important change has
been the introduction of the "responsibility
MA SHIYU, of China, is a contributor to the
English language newspaper China Daily.
system" which has led to a remarkable in¬
crease in farm productivity, even in regions
where agriculture is most backward, and
the last three years have been notable for
bumper harvests.
In the past, the method of sharing out the
fruits of the harvest caused dissatisfaction
among the peasants who felt that their
labour was not being fairly rewarded; pro¬
ductivity remained stagnant or even
decreased.
Under the new responsibility system each
farm household contracts to farm a certain
area of land and to deliver a part of the crop
to the State and to the commune, keeping
whatever they grow above the quota. This
means that each farming household is free
to manage its work itself and to assume sole
responsibility for its profits or losses. At the
same time land and the means of produc¬
tion remain the property of the collective
body.
The new system is already evolving.
Agricultural co-operatives have been
established which handle specialized pro¬
duction, such as raising ducks or fish, or
offer specialized services, such as sugar re¬
fining and transport services.
Never before have so many Chinese
peasants had so much money. Today, more
than 60 per cent of all the nation's cash is
circulating in the countryside. By the end of
1982, peasant families had 28.2 billion yuan
($15.2 billion) on deposit in banks, an
average of more than 30 yuan for every
man, woman and child in the rural areas.
To this must be added the 32.3 billion yuan
deposited by rural collectives, factories and
enterprises, making a total in rural banks of
60.5 billion. Five years ago it was only 25
billion.
According to preliminary figures released
by the State Statistical Bureau, the cash in¬
come of peasants increased at an average

annual rate of 19.4 billion yuan in the four
years 1979 to 1982. This is 6.9 times the
average annual increase for the twenty-six
years 1952 to 1978.
A survey of 18,000 peasant households in
twenty-six provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions showed that the
number of families with an annual per
capita income exceeding 300 yuan grew
from 2.4 per cent in 1978 to 22.6 per cent in
1981 , the most well-off families being those
with special skillsraising chickens, ducks,
fish or bees, or cultivating marketable
herbs. The proportion of poor families with
an annual per capita income below 100
yuan dropped from 33.3 per cent in 1978 to
4.7 per cent in 1981.
Chinese peasants spent 148 billion yuan
on capital and consumer goods and
building materials in 1982. This was an 1 1 .8
per cent increase over 1981 and 82.6 per
cent over 1978.
As the purchasing power of farming
families increases, the demand for in¬
dustrial products becomes greater and
greater. Farm tools and equipment and
other aids to production are the first priori¬
ty, followed by materials for building and
repairing houses, with consumer goods
third.
Under the responsibility system there has
been a change in the pattern of mechaniza¬
tion with a decrease in demand for large and
medium-size farming equipment and an in¬
crease in purchases of small, semi-
mechanized equipment such as 3 to 8
horsepower compact tractors, processing
machines, pumps, swathers, windrowers
and wheelbarrows. Not only are these
small-size machines and implements
cheaper to buy and easier to maintain and
operate, they also adapt more easily than
larger equipment to the varying natural
conditions throughout the country and are
more in keeping with the size of the
household production unit and with the
present technical, economic and cultural
level of the Chinese rural worker.
Chinese peasant families now eat more
rice and wheat than coarse grains and this
change in their traditional diet is a clear in¬
dication of their improved standard of

living. According to the State Statistical
Bureau survey grain consumption per
capita reached 256 kilograms in 1981, with
rice and wheat accounting for 67 per cent as
against 49 per cent in 1978, the remainder
being made up of corn, sorghum, millet and
other coarse grains.
The survey also shows an increase in pro¬
tein intake among rural families. In 1981
per capita daily protein intake was 66.82
grammes, 4 per cent higher than in 1978.
Average annual consumption of pork, ed¬
ible oils, poultry, eggs and fish all increased
and many peasant families are now raising
chickens and ducks for family consumption
and sale.
The cost of living in the countryside is
lower than in the cities. The majority of
rural families own the houses they live in
and do not have the burden of rent; they
produce virtually all the vegetables, meat
and poultry they need and a peasant family
with a per capita annual income of 200 yuan
is therefore considered to be tolerably well-
off.

Arable land: Land under temporary crops, temporary meadows, land under market and kitchen
gardens, and land temporarily fallow or lying idle.
Land under permanent crops refers to land cultivated with crops that occupy the land for long
periods and need not be replanted after each harvest, such as cocoa, coffee and rubber. It in¬
cludes land under shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees and vines, but excludes land under trees grown
for wood or timber.

The kolkhoz
of Chtcherbani
by Yevgeny Novikov
DECADE after decade, century
after century, drought has struck
the steppelands on the shores of the
Black Sea with inexorable regularity. And
although the chernozem, the rich black
earth of this region in which the ancient
village of Chtcherbani is situated, is capable
of producing abundant harvests, four years
out of ten the vital element of water is lack¬
ing. In other words, this is an area typical of
the regions of "risk agriculture" in which
the Soviet Union produces three-quarters of
the cereals it needs.
The village of Chtcherbani is older than
most towns in the Soviet Union. Two and a
half centuries ago, the Cossacks responsible
for the defence of Russia's southern
borders established their winter quarters
there. Between campaigns the Cossacks
YEVGENY VLADIMIROVICH NOVIKOV is a

jects in the Soviet press and elsewhere.
returned to Chtcherbani there to live the or¬
dinary life of peacetime, living in their own
houses with their families, tilling the land
and raising sheep. In the middle of the last
century some 1 ,600 people lived at Chtcher¬
bani, approximately the same number as
today.
The present-day inhabitants of Chtcher¬
bani are organized in a kolkhoz, one of the
co-operative agricultural enterprises
operated by peasants typical of Soviet
agriculture, which, with the sovkhozy, the
large State-operated farming units, produce
ninety per cent of the agricultural output of
the Soviet Union.
In conformity with the regulations, any
inhabitant of the village aged 16 or over
who is willing to contribute his labour can
become a member of the kolkhoz. The
kolkhoz has a permanent allocation of
10,000 hectares of land and is run by a
chairman and a committee elected for a

"The kolkhoz has 6,500 hectares of
arable land of which a third can be ir¬

year it produces 6,000 to 10,000 tons of
cereals, 9,000 to 12,000 tons of vegetables,
700 to 850 tons of sunflower seeds, nearly
1 ,200 tons of meat, over 3,000 tons of milk,
30 tons of wool and more than 1,500,000
eggs. The greater part of this production is
sold to the State and earns for the kolkhoz
a gross revenue of 5 million roubles (at the '
official rate, one rouble equals $1.40).
"Our dealings with the State are based on
the national Five-Year-Plan", he added.
"In determining our annual and our five-

with local officers of the Plan the type and

them. On the basis of this production

Above, this aerial view of a Soviet kolkhoz gives an idea of the extent of its lands, a factor which favours the use of large scale
agricultural machinery. Today, the Soviet Union has a striking record in agriculture ranking among the world's top five producers
for twenty-five different food products. This is an impressive achievement when it is remembered that, during the Second World
War, occupying forces ravaged the land and slaughtered 60 million head of cattle. The Second World War cost the USSR more than
30 per cent of its national wealth 1710 towns and more than 70,000 hamlets and villages were partially or totally destroyed and
tens of thousands of kolkhozy and sovkhozy were devastated.
tilizers and other industrial products."
In theory the kolkhoz is independent, but
its economic interests are so closely linked
with those of the State that each is depen¬
dent on the other, a situation which, accor¬
ding to Riabochapka, is on the whole
favourable to the members of the kolkhoz.
For example, they have a guaranteed
market for their products at a purchase
price which makes it possible for them to
make, a profit.
During the period 1976 to 1980, the pur¬
chase price fixed for cereals was such that
on two occasions the kolkhoz made a profit
of over 100 per cent; only in the bad year of
1980 did the profit drop to 60 per cent.
Sunflower seeds have proved to be a suc¬
cessful crop and members of the kolkhoz
have also done well with their sales of
vegetables, although in recent years milk
and meat production have resulted in a
deficit. The overall profitability of the
kolkhoz varies, but, even in the worst years
of drought, it has never fallen below 12 per
cent.
Improvement is expected in the return on
stock-farming since the State has raised the
purchase price of milk and meat
throughout the country with effect from
January 1983. Each year the State puts
aside about 16,000 million roubles for the
improvement of purchase prices and for the
subsidies paid to the less profitable produc¬
tion units. A feature of the Soviet economy
is that purchase prices are not reduced in
good years and this stimulates the sale of
surplus production which is fixed in pro¬
portion to average output over the previous
five years.
According to Nikolai Riabochapka, the
agreements negotiated with the State have a
stabilizing influence on the production
policy of the kolkhoz which cannot be
changed abruptly from year to year. But to
fulfil its commitments, the kolkhoz is free
to make use of the means at its disposal as
it thinks fit.
In Tsarist Russia, vast areas of the finest
land belonged to the great landowners, to
members of the imperial family, to
speculators and to non-working landlords;
these between them owned 150 million hec¬
tares. A further 80 million hectares belong¬
ed to the kulaks, or wealthy peasants, who
represented a sixth of all landowners. This
left only 135 million hectares for more than
20 million poor peasant households.
Generally speaking, the ordinary pea¬
sant's plot of land was insufficient to ensure
his family's subsistence. In years of normal
harvest about half the peasants of Russia
had insufficient wheat to last them through
to the next harvest. They suffered from
hunger in their millions, whilst the land¬
owners and the kulaks sold their wheat
abroad. At that time Russia was the world's
largest exporter of grain.
After 1917, a decree of the young Soviet
State abolished the right of private owner¬
ship of land, the properties of the imperial
family and other landowners were con¬
fiscated and their exploitation was en¬
trusted to those who were willing to work
them themselves, all hired labour being
forbidden.

Nevertheless, the peasants still experienc¬
ed considerable difficulty in getting the best
from the land. Bearing in mind that each
family produced as many as ten or more dif¬
ferent types of crop, it is easy to imagine
how small a plot of land was devoted to
each crop. The only way out of this situa¬
tion seemed to be the introduction of collec¬
tive agriculture by the creation of a system
of co-operative production.
The first kolkhoz was formed at Chtcher¬
bani in 1924 and consisted of eleven poor
families out of a total of over 300 in the
village. Although the authorities provided
credit, seeds and technical assistance and
organized centres for agricultural
machinery and tractors, it took five years to
overcome the peasants' mistrust of co¬
operative ventures. By 1929, the poor
peasants of Chtcherbani had organized six
kolkhozy, each of which managed 1,500
hectares of land. Within a year they sold to
the State 14.7 tons of wheat, an achieve¬
ment which was recognized as a con¬
siderable success.
After the setback of the enormous
damage suffered during the Second World
War, the Soviet economy resumed its rapid
growth. Statistics show that at the beginn-
ing of the century three-quarters of the
working population of Russia were
employed in agriculture. Today the propor¬
tion of agricultural workers is four times
lower, while gross agricultural production
is four times greater.
Average annual production of cereals
rose from 72.5 million tons in 1909-1913 to
205 million tons in the latter half of the
1970s. Since then production has risen to
0.8 tons per head of population, but this is
still insufficient. It is estimated that a pro¬
duction of one ton per head of population
is needed to meet normal cereal re¬
quirements and to ensure adequate supplies
of stock-feed concentrates.
Since the founding of the Soviet Union,
production in other major agricultural sec¬
tors has also increased production of milk
and meat has at least trebled, production of
vegetables has increased five times, of eggs
six times and of cotton fifteen times. Today
the USSR is the world's leading producer of
wheat, sugar beet, sunflower seed, cotton,
flax, potatoes, milk and butter.
The rate of growth in production of
foodstuffs has consistently been greater
than the rate of growth in population,
which has increased by 35 million since
1965; but this in turn has been outstripped
by the growth in individual incomes as a
result of which it has been necessary to im¬
port some agricultural products to meet the
subsequent increase in demand. A new food
programme has now been established aimed
at achieving an effective balance between
supply and demand and satisfying the needs
of the population.
Agricultural productivity in the Soviet
Union is often assessed in comparison with
that of other countries with advanced
agricultural economies, but it is too often
forgotten that Soviet agricultural workers
have to contend with unfavourable natural
and climatic conditions.
20
In the USSR, nearly 60 per cent of
agricultural land and 58 per cent of arable
land is situated in areas liable to drought or
semi-drought conditions; 40 per cent of the
arable land receives less than 400 mm of
rain a year. Less than 1.1. per cent of
agricultural land is located in areas
benefiting from optimum growing
conditions.
Each peasant household supplements its
income by cultivating its own individual
plot of land which may be as big as half a
hectare. At Chtcherbani, for example, the
581 households all cultivate their family
plots which produce enough fruit and
vegetables to meet their own needs and pro¬
vide a surplus for sale at the local market.
The kolkhoz also offers each household, at
virtually cost price, chickens, pigs and fat¬
tening cattle which they are encouraged to
raise on their individual plots. Feed and
veterinary care and advice are also
provided.
The Chtcherbani kolkhoz includes about
a hundred specialists such as agronomists,
stock-breeding experts and mechanical
engineers. At the beginning of the century,
the only educated people in a Russian
village were the priest, the landowner, the
health officer, the teacher and the land
surveyor. A good three-quarters of the
peasants could neither read nor write.
In 1890, a primary school was opened at
Chtcherbani, but, as a representative of the
local authorities declared: "In such a
poverty-stricken village the indigence of the
people is such that they cannot send their
children to school for the simple reason that
they haven't the wherewithal to clothe
them." Today, two-thirds of the working
population of the village have a complete or
partial secondary or higher education. One
family in three has its own library and the
village's two public libraries contain some
18,000 books.
In one of these books an extract from a
document dating back a hundred years
catches the eye. "The inhabitants of the
region have reached such a degree of pover¬
ty that immediate aid is essential. And this
aid should be an outright gift, since a loan
would only add to their already huge debts
which they will never be able to repay..."
The value of this document is that it acts as
a kind of benchmark for the villagers, a
criterion by which to évalue and appreciate
the changes that are apparent in their lives
today.

In most kolkhozy, the Cultural Centre, with its artists' studios, cinema and
concert halls, its libraries and its clubrooms, is the focus of intense social
and cultural activity. The spread of ownership of television sets and other
audio-visual equipment has not reduced the frequency of peasant family
visits to theatres and museums. Below, Cotton-picking in Armenia (1 931 ),

Peasant values
An interview with French historian
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie
Courier. In one of your books, you analyse a triangular relation¬
ship between peasant, land and lord. How has this relationship
evolved since the Middle Ages, especially in modern times?
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. The relationship is certainly very an¬
cient. In some respects it may, at least insofar as France, or Gaul,
is concerned, go back to the Celtic chieftains of the Iron Age, who
were perhaps "pre-lords".
This "triangle" implies that the lord has the higher title to the
land, that he may even enjoy property rights over men, in which
case they are serfs; but this is not always the case. It implies that
these men, the peasants, have a certain "possession" of their land
in common with the lord. Their connexion with the lord is express¬
ed in the fact that they pay him dues in cash or in kind. They obey
his orders. They sometimes, though not always, perform statute
labour on his land. This is, more or less, the nature of the land-
peasant-lord triangle. It has varied. During the age of Charlemagne
in Europethings may have been different elsewhereit required
the peasants to perform a large amount of statute labour for the
great lords, notably the great ecclesiastical landlords. From the
eleventh century on there is far less statute labour only a few days
a year; there are above all payments in corn, in grain, and later in
money. Finally, starting with the French Revolution, the lord
becomes simply the owner of a great estate, and his links with the
EMMANUEL LE ROY LADURIE is a French historian and a Professor
at the Collège de France. He is the author of a number of books including
Montaillou, Village Occitan (1975), Paysans du Languedoc (1977) and Car¬
naval de Romans (1979).
peasants continue to be links of patronage, protection and pater¬
nalism, but the peasants are no longer bound to pay him dues even
if they recognize his leadership and still feel a certain respect for
him. Sometimes they rebel against him. In Europe today the feudal
lord is a figure of the past, but there are still great landowners to
whom the peasants may sometimes feel bound by a certain link of
deference.
Courier. How do you see the reciprocal influence between rural
and urban civilization in Western Europe today?
ELRL. Urban civilization has destructive aspects. In a sense it has
destroyed many things, if only through the exodus from the coun¬
tryside. Villages have emptied; the peasants who have left the land
have done so to look for a more agreeable existence and in many
cases they have found one. There is no reason to idealize country
life in olden days, but the result of this exodus has often been to im¬
poverish social life in the villages. On the other hand, urban
civilization city culturehas introduced modernity into our
villages. The peasant in France, in Western Europe has
generated an increase in productivity which has been very swift and
much greater than in industry. It is true that agricultural productivi¬
ty was initially at a far lower level. The country people, in various
regions, were traditional. But now many of them have become en¬
trepreneurs, often burdened with a heavy load of work; no question
of a thirty-nine-hour week for them.
Courier. What about the influence of mass culture, the mass
media? How do you see the changes in what might be called the
peasant imagination?

>ELRL. Strictly speaking, the peasant imagination has virtually
ceased to exist today. In any case, it was always linked to urban
culture. Even what is called rural folklore was dependent on a com¬
parable folklore of the towns. One example of this is the religious
festivals which in "peasant" custom often derived from Christian
festivals as they were celebrated in the towns. It is true that
witchcraft in the countryside is an older phenomenon. It may go
back to certain pre-Christian religious forms but in any case it has
become extremely marginal. Today the fact remains that the
peasant is by definition more closely linked to nature (though he
sometimes destroys it with pesticides), and relates to the forest and
to animal life in ways which are much more direct and vital than
those of the city-dweller.
As for religion, it is a more living force in the countryside, where
traditional Catholicism in many cases still plays a more important
role than in the towns where, nevertheless, it has not totally ceased
to exist. Local patois have in many cases disappeared, notably in
France. They scarcely exist except in the form of an accent, and this
is dying out... Dialects are still used by a few old country people
and... on the campus by trendy students. It is true that in the case
of France the propagation of the national language has perhaps
been more forceful and determined than elsewhere... In
Switzerland on the other hand dialects are still used in the villages
and even in the towns, at least in the German-speaking cantons, but
not in French-speaking Switzerland. Furthermore, peasants are ful¬
ly involved in the audiovisual and televised culture which they share
with the towns. To round off the picture, let's not forget the young
rural-dwellers thundering through the countryside on their motor¬
cycles.
In France and in other European countries, many peasants fifty
years ago achieved an extremely high level of basic culture, thanks
to good primary school teachers. Today, as in the towns, there has
22
been a decline. On the other hand, the technical and farming
culture of country people has progressed. They now have a mastery
of modern technology.
Courier. From an anthropological point of view, do you consider
this influence to be a source of enrichment of peasant culture or as
an erosion, a loss of certain values?
ELRL. I think the effects are very different in nature. Again, it
would be wrong to feel an unqualified nostalgia. Immense gains
have been made from the point of view of social improvement. But
the problem is that each step forward, each individual benefit en¬
joyed by a person who leaves the village, often causes an erosion,
if not the destruction, of the village community itself, because of
the exodus from the countryside.
This is particularly true in the case of villages which are remote
from the towns. As soon as you get a little closer to the towns, a
certain suburbanization appears, with the result that the village is
still a living place in appearance, but in fact the community is no
longer the same. Around 1850-1880, a part of the village communi¬
ty achieved a certain level of culture, expressed in the form of
craftsmanship, modes of dress, and the propagation of an oral
culture, notably during the veillées, the social evenings spent with
neighbours during the winter months. There is absolutely no reason
to idealize that. The overall situation remained poor... The folk
stories transmitted by word of mouth were, for example, in many
cases simply a repetition of what such and such a villager had read
in the tales of Perrault or other anthologies. However, it is certain
that between 1850 and 1983 some ground has been lost.
Ultimately, the problems are perhaps not very different from
those you find in the towns; the new audiovisual media are jeopar¬
dizing reading, which was one of the great evening pastimes of a
(small) minority of peasants. Not that one should paint too sombre

a picture: in the last decade or so the reading habit is again
spreading in France, perhaps in the country areas.
Nevertheless, there is still a strong feeling of frustration. I am not
in any sense a countryman, although I was born in the country. But
recently I took part in a meeting of writers from rural areas who ac¬
tually were farmers: they were novelists, poets, and so on. They
gave the impression that they had a very big inferiority complex, a
feeling of deprivation and regret in relation to urban culture, and
of being despised. Sometimes, alas, this is so; but perhaps they were
exaggerating other people's disdain for them.
Courier. And is that literature still deeply rooted?
ELRL. It is often produced by old people, sometimes by women,
young women. I won't say that this peasant literature is out¬
standing, but it is evidence of an interesting initiative. It was
displayed at this year's Paris Agricultural Show. Publication at the
author's expense is a practice which provokes amusement and irony
in the average writer. Among these people, however, it is highly
thought of. They have no contacts with Paris publishers; they are
proud to pay for the publication of a book themselves and then to
sell it on their own initiative, just as they would sell fruit or cheese.
And so it is not at all the same value system as in the towns. In a
sense it is a marvellous thing to see someone finance a work that he
has written and then go off and sell it as he would the products of
his farm.
Courier. Among the regions of France you have studied, are there
some where peasant life is more strongly marked, with more
original values?
ELRL. The phenomenon is ambiguous. On the one hand in modern
areas like the Paris region, farmers are technicians of the first order
but they no longer have much in common with the peasants of
former days. They are not very interested in the culture of their
ancestors, which they consider to be a thing of the past. Con¬
trariwise, in the poorer, traditional regions, this traditional spirit
sometimes takes the form of a feeling of poverty or injustice. One
day I met a young countrywoman who kept a very strong connexion
with the ancient rural culture; her technique for making the Yule
log corresponded exactly with practices in the south of France a
century and a half ago. And around 1920 she had heard what is
known as the wild hunt, the rushing of the souls of dead children
above the forest. That is a very old myth. She told the story with
great conviction. She was close to an ancient rural culture of the
Middle Ages or the Renaissance, which was once common to the
towns and the countryside. Without being in real need, she was
nevertheless poor. Her sons were unmarried. She gave the impres¬
sion that she was not profiting from a certain number of the
benefits of modern civilization. Survivals of this kind do not always
mean happiness.
Courier. Is it possible to see traces of rural cultures in the culture
of certain provincial towns? I imagine that in Paris it is rather dif¬
ficult to find such traces.
ELRL. There were still cows in Paris fifty-odd years ago. Many
workers in medium-sized towns still have a vegetable garden. The
output from these gardens is quite substantial; this is a continuing
link with agricultural life. In addition, a number of customs have
survived to a marked degree, especially as regards modes of in¬
heritance. A French historian and ethnologist named Lamaison has
carried out a survey among notaries. Judging from the map of
France he has drawn up, it seems that the custom of organizing the
inheritance in favour of one child rather than several descendants,
in short the practice of not dividing up the goods after death in ac¬
cordance with a will, still bears a great similarity in certain areas to
what was going on even before the French Revolution. This is
permanence!
Courier. Have any beliefs other than Christianity survived?
ELRL. Yes. Not so many non-Christian beliefs, but others which
are on the fringe of Christianity. For example I have noted a certain
cult of trees in the Massif Central. In a shrine dedicated to a saint,
(Christian) agrarian rites for the fertility of livestock can be seen,
and such rites are even practised beside trees which are implicitly
believed to be sacred. These practices do not necessarily go back to
Roman times; perhaps they simply became established in the
Middle Ages or the sixteenth century and have lasted ever since.
This doesn't amount to very much. The real continuity is to be
found in such rituals as those concerning death and marriagein
Christian usages in the strictest sense. A burial requires, for exam¬
ple, a sense of the sacred, the religious spirit, the intervention of the
community... That joins us more to the past in the villages or in
small towns than in the big cities. The bonds of the community are
necessarily more distended there.

Courier. And do you think that all these vestiges of peasant or
rural culture are tending to disappear forever?
ELRL. Not necessarily. Of course only a fairly small minority of
the population is concerned. In spite of everything, agricultural
production is still vitally necessary. In a sense, French agriculture
is in a better state than French industry.
Whatever happens, certain structures will remain. Furthermore,
not only the countryside is involved. We mustn't forget the small
towns. The percentage of French people who live in small or
medium-sized towns of less than 20,000 inhabitants has not greatly
changed in the last fifty years. From the point of view of the conser-
Courier. In general, do you think that all these phenomena which
are eroding an agrarian or peasant culture are common to the coun¬
tries of Western Europe?
ELRL. I don't know very much about what is happening in the
countries of the East, but I think that there are no basic differences
between the countries of Western Europe. Modernization and the
rapid depopulation of villages are rampant. And in spite of that
there is the conservation, not so much of a folklore which would
indeed be artificial, but of neighbourly relationships and a certain
religious assiduity in many cases... I imagine, for example, that a

vation of a relatively traditional way of life, these small towns and
the countryside seem to me to be the repository of a certain
continuity.
For better or for worse, some regions of Europe still preserve a
traditional way of life, I have visited one of these areas, that of the
Pomaks in northeastern Greece, Muslim Slavs who live in a frontier
area. There I saw an agriculture comparable to that of the eigh¬
teenth century. The slopes continue to be cultivated. The observer
feels that this is a way of life which has undergone little change. I
suppose that it would still be possible to find a few areas of the same
type in Europe.

region like Bavaria, although it is now urbanized, has succeeded in
preserving quite a few religious and dialect characteristics... The
same goes- for certain areas of Italy and Spain... Modernity is not
entirely nor necessarily destructive. It can also keep alive a certain
nucleus of human relationships. Paradoxically, it is in the regions
which are most rapidly becoming depopulated (as in the mountains
from which human life is withdrawing, except for skiing) that ar¬
chaic structures are destroyed. But in the more vigorous rural areas,
modernity is, I think, helping to preserve a nucleus of traditions,
or of continuity, at least, with moral and religious values, and also
community and family ties.

U.S. farmers are keenly aware that
millions throughout the world are
malnourished, and millions more are starv¬
ing. "We are deeply frustrated and sadden¬
ed that governments of the world won't get
together and solve barriers caused by inade¬
quate transportation, distribution and
jealousies", asserts Robert Hughes, a dairy
farmer in Woodstock, Illinois, the
heartland of the Midwestern United States.

of the success stories of this generation.
About two-and-a-half million farmers in
the United States cultivate 140 million hec¬
tares. The United States exports about 115
million tons of its feed grain. Hughes says
55 per cent of that total is produced in the
great Midwestern heartland a dozen
States stretching from Nebraska and Kan¬
sas in the west to Ohio in the east.
What enables U.S. farmers to be so pro¬
ductive and efficient? Robert Hughes lists
some of the factors, in addition to soil and
climate. There is a system of incentives
where initiative and decision-making are
the catalyst. "If we do well, we are finan¬
cially rewarded," Hughes says simply. As a
result of the incentives, research is carried
out into new techniques. The development
of selective herbicides is one example of
this. Another is the more scientific ap¬
proach to the use of fertilizers which
enhances the selective breeding and improv¬
ed development of hybrid seeds. At the
same time improved herbicides and insec¬
ticides, combined with sophisticated fer¬
tilization techniques, permit farmers to
plant corn more intensely. Hughes recalls
that in the middle 1950s he planted corn in
rows one metre apart, 35,000 plants to the
hectare, and planted so that it could be
cultivated both ways. Now, with good in¬
sect and weed control, he plants corn 20-25
centimetres apart in rows that are 75 cen¬
timetres apart. "Genetic selection to pro¬
duce good seed corn that will thrive under
such crowded conditions is another factor
in successful crop yields," he says.
Finally, large machinery, with farmers
capable of planting forty hectares a day,
enables them to prepare the soil and plant
crops at the peak time to take advantage of
ideal moisture and sunshine conditions.
Hughes says that the ideal time to plant
corn in northern Illinois lasts only between
fifteen and twenty days. For each day out¬
side that "ideal time" that he plants corn,
yields decrease from one to five bushels a
day. The combine harvester, which costs
$75,000, adds to his efficiency, enabling
him to harvest corn at the best time, with
minimum field losses caused by bad
weather in late fall. ,
Developed in the early years of the century, milking machines were not widely adopted
in the United States until after World War II. Since then hand milking has come to an
end in commercial dairy farming. Illinois farmer Robert Hughes milks twice a day, like
most dairymen in the United States.
The lives of farming men and women in
the Midwestern United States centre on
their families. Virtually all choose to live on
the farm because of the joy and satisfaction
that comes from tilling the soil, nurturing
seeds, harvesting crops, and raising
livestock.
Their daily working responsibilities and
their social life are intertwined. They take
an active part in the life of their community,
in which there is a closely knit relationship
between urban and rural families because

For most rural people their local church
is a focal point of activity a social,
religious and community centre. They teach
Sunday school, which is a programme of
Bible study, meditation and learning how to
apply the teaching of Jesus Christ. Atten¬
dance at Sunday church service is followed
by relaxed socializing over coffee in the
community room with discussions of cur¬
rent crop conditions and local school news.
Free education for all is an inherent right
of all citizens, and farm people are among
the leaders in serving on the boards of un¬
paid volunteers which guide the work of
local schools. In Woodstock, Robert
Hughes's father was a long-time board
president and leader who insisted on quality
education for rural and urban families
alike. Robert and his wife Genevieve are
members of the Parent-Teachers Associa¬
tion, a group in which teachers and parents
work together so that their children can
benefit from enlightened educational
techniques.

organization of farmers, Farm Bureau aims
to promote better crop production, improv¬
ed marketing know-how and better com¬
munication with the 97 per cent of the
people of the United States who belong to
non-farming families.
An overwhelming number of future
farmers come from the families of farming
men and women. They learn a great deal
while growing up because they are involved
in the day-to-day responsibilities, from
milking cows to planting corn and mowing
hay. Eager to keep abreast of current
technological and scientific developments,
farm youngsters join their parents in the
quest for knowledge about scientific
breakthroughs. From computer programs
designed for farmers to improved seeds to
withstand the stress of drought or an insect
invasion, all family members welcome
seminars and college-planned programmes.
"Farming is a way of life," says Robert
Hughes. "That may seem simplistic, but it
is true. We devote a great deal of time to
farming. A dairy farmer, for example, is
tied down seven days a week. Farms in the
United States are 99 per cent family farms,
and so everyday living means the family is
together.
"By nature farmers are optimists. We
have the freedom to do what we can do
best: feed livestock, raise grain or milk
cows, switch to another crop or cut back.
We're on our own in that respect, even
though government involvement certainly
affects everyone. We are hardy and im¬
aginative. We'll fertilize more efficiently.
We'll use more no-till to reduce costs and at
the same time save our valuable soil. These
are some of the thoughts that go through
my mind when I look out over my growing
corn, bathed in sunlight and urged on by the
warm June sun."

Rice is harvested by powerful combines in the United States before being trucked off

Where town meets

BEFORE the Second World War, Bul¬
garia ranked among the agricultural¬
ly backward countries of Europe.
Agricultural land was divided into 12 million
plots and this fragmentation resulted in low
productivity and deteriorating social and
economic conditions. The peasants tilled the
land with wooden or crude iron ploughs,
harvested the crops with sickles and threshed
the corn with primitive, spike-studded
threshing boards.
Between 1940 and 1944 the average yield of
wheat was 999.5 kilograms per hectare, and
of maize 941 kilograms. The annual milk
yield of a dairy cow averaged about 500 litres
while wool production amounted to 2.5
kilograms per sheep. In the 1950s, most
villages were still without electricity and runn¬
ing water and had no public health, social or
cultural facilities.
The socialist reorganization of agriculture
followed three main directions: voluntary re¬
grouping of farming land through the
gradual establishment of co-operatives;
mechanization and re-equipment by means of
grants and long-term, low-interest loans and
the establishment of State tractor and
agricultural machinery centres; radical
transformation of the social conditions of life
of the rural population.
By about 1956, most of the individual land-
holdings had been re-grouped into co¬
operative farms. The rural workers made
redundant by this reorganizationtheir
numbers were swelled when the primitive

working implements of the past were con¬
signed to their rightful place in museums-
found new productive employment thanks
to the industrialization of the country and
the urban growth this entailed. Today over
65 per cent of the population live in the
towns, compared with 25 per cent in 1944,
whereas the working rural population
amounts to 20 per cent or less.
The period 1960 to 1970 saw further ad¬
vances in the restructuring of agriculture,
while urbanization developed apace. This
process, which took on a variety of forms
whose economic, political and social objec¬
tives nevertheless converged, involved
changes in the administrative and
managerial structures of the country.
Within the framework of the twenty-nine
main administrative units (the departments)
291 districts were established and the coun¬
try's 854 co-operative farms were
reorganized into 290 agro-industrial com¬
plexes. All the complexes of a department
together form a departmental agricultural
and industrial union and these unions in
turn are linked to constitute a national
agricultural and industrial union which has
the rank of a ministry, although it is not
financed by the State and functions along
traditional co-operative lines.

Thus, today, agriculture in Bulgaria is
fully integrated with the engineering,
chemical and processing industries as well
as with the various scientific organizations.
The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, with
its national network of scientific institutes
and experimental centres, as well as all
agricultural schools and colleges, are in¬
stitutional members of the union. All
members of the union retain their rights as
individual entities and are financially
autonomous with their own reserve funds.
Associated directly in this way with collec¬
tively organized labour, science and
technology become an integral part of
socialist agriculture, just as the farm
worker's labour becomes a form of in¬
dustrial labour.
In terms of output, agriculture in
Bulgaria has already reached the level of the
most advanced countries. In 1982, for ex¬
ample, average yields per hectare in
kilograms were: wheat 4,666, maize 5,771,
tomatoes 29,908, sugar beet 27,284, pep¬
pers 17,189, and potatoes 11,706. Bulgaria
now produces more than a ton of cereals per
head of population and average individual
consumption per year is: bread 216 kg,
meat 61.2 kg, animal and vegetable fats 21
kg, milk and dairy products 170 kg, sugar
and confectionery 35 kg, eggs 204.
Agriculture under private enterprise can
also achieve good results in quantitative
terms, but the salient feature of the history
of the development of socialist agriculture
is the radical transformation it has brought
about in the social situation and daily lives
of rural workers. In practical terms, this
transformation has meant a considerable
rise in the standard of living: complete
modernization of housing and consumer
goods household equipment, radio,
television and cars; equal pay for equal
work for men, women and young people;
introduction of a single social security and
pension system for agricultural, industrial
and clerical workers (women are eligible for
a pension at 55, men at 60); free medical
services and education for all. Bulgarian
villages have also been fully modernized in
all respectsarchitectural, communal,
cultural and social. Every village has its
public library and cinema, and a cultural
centre where the popular arts and traditions
are preserved and enriched, and is linked to
the rest of the country by a huge road and
rail network, telephone, telegraphic and
radio links and a modern postal service.
The old image of the isolated village cut
off from the world is today to be found only
in books or museums. Within a very short
time span socialist Bulgaria has succeeded
in resolving the age old antagonism between
town and country.

The new nomads
by Jean Fauchon
Amotionless cloud of yellow dust hung over the sandy track
which had brought us, in three hours, from Lagbar, the
capital of the Ferio desert in the north of Senegal, to the
N'Doli well. Little by little the still air filled with a chorus of low-
ings and bellowings and cries of all kinds, as herds in ever larger
numbers crossed our path. At first a few white buildings and then,
suddenly, we came to an immense square. In the middle were long
iron troughs, supplied by a tall water-tower, and all around animals
in their thousands, carefully separated into groupswhite cows
with enormous horns, countless perfectly disciplined goats, long-
legged sheep and now and again cowherds or shepherds riding
horses and camels.
Each herd drank its fill then left the troughs, to be replaced im¬
mediately by another, and set off across the Ferio towards the
pastureland to spend the night, grazing on the carpet of grass and
flowers which the rainy seasonfrom about July to September in
those partshad just brought forth.
Though partially settled, the Peuls still remain nomads because
their lives are bound up with those of their animals and the tem¬
porary pastures on which they live. But they are " new " nomads
in that they follow organized circuits in search of grazing for their
herds, often watering them at specially bored wells around which
rural townships are gradually growing up, even providing medical
care, veterinary services, shopping facilities and sometimes schools.
Ail this is a far cry from the picture of nomads we have
cherishedhuge caravans traversing the steppes of central Asia to
trade silk and cinnamon for rugs, jade or ivory; warring Tuaregs
roaming the Sanaran wastes, keeping African slaves under their
yoke to farm for them the fringes of the desert; Peul or Masai

herdsmen driving their half-starved cattle in search of conjectural
grasslands. In short, people living in arid, if not desert regions who,
out of economic necessity, have adopted a way of life involving vir¬
tually continuous movement in order to ensure their livelihood.
What is the position today? Maritime transport, lorries, even
aeroplanes, have consigned to history the once endless files of
caravans along the Silk Road. However, beasts of burden still have
a considerable role to play in the transport of certain goods, par¬
ticularly products which have to be brought from remote regions to
the major highways. Salt from the Uyuni lagoons of Bolivia is
distributed on the high Andean plateaux by teams of lamas several
hundred strong, and from the Bilma mines of Niger throughout the
Sahel and the Sudan by Tuareg caravans.
Other forms of transport are more local. Each year hundreds of
yaks cross the Tibetan border through the upper valley of the
Tsangbu to trade Chinese salt or wool for corn and potatoes from
Nepal. Camels bring to the road terminals cabbages, onions and
other vegetables from the region of the Nyayes, north of Dakar
along sandy tracks in which the wheels of motor vehicles would
sink, but which their wide-spreading, two-toed feet tread without
difficulty.
The men who lead these beasts of burden are rarely accompanied
by their families, and they could scarcely be said to be a " nomad "
society with all the attributes of nomad civilization. It might even
be asked whether such societies still exist today.
The pressure of economic, social and cultural upheavals is caus¬
ing these groups to evolve rapidly, if not to disappear altogether.
In the Sahara, some of them, having lost their sovereignty over the
oases cultivated by their former slaves, have begun to live off their
camels, rearing them for their meat and skins and constantly
searching for the grazing on which they are more and more depen¬
dent. Some make seasonal migrations, moving towards the arable
land along the river banks in the dry season and, when the rains
come, dispersing once more to the scattered temporary watering

The Rendille people, who number about 9,000, are nomadic
herdsmen from a region to the south-east of Lake Turkana,
Kenya. They depend for their livelihood mainly on camels with
whom they roam as far as Somalia and Ethiopia in search of
water and grazing. Above, a Rendille encampment and, below,

places. Others have settled and started to grow crops on the former
flood plains, while still keeping some sheep and goats. Occasional¬
ly, newly-discovered mineral deposits, especially oil or uranium,
provide nomads with opportunities for employment, hampered
though they are by their lack of general or technical training.
The great droughts of the last decade have had disastrous conse¬
quences not only in the Sahel but also in many other regions. In
Mauritania, in 1965, 58 per cent of the population were classified
as nomads. Ten years later, the figure had dwindled to 25 per cent
and, after the great drought of 1977, which caused irreparable
damage, dropped still further. During the same period, the settled
rural population increased from 15 to 42 per cent and the urban
population from 7 to 31 per cent. Mali, Chad and the Sudan were
similarly affected; in certain regions men left their families to seek
a means of survival and never returned; sometimes,after losing all
their herds, they committed suicide. Thus the droughts hastened an
evolution which had been taking shape for several years.
Nomad herdsmen are, in fact, menaced by a more serious threat.
In the Sahel, the scarcity of arable land, combined with population
pressure, has caused farmers to extend the areas they cultivate fur¬
ther and further northwards, to the regions where the last of the
rains from the Gulf of Guinea fall. These regions, with their scant
and uncertain rainfall (from 100 to 300 mm a year), had long been
the preserve of the nomad herdsmen who knew how to use them to
the best advantage, moving their cattle from pasture to pasture. But
they are gradually being ousted by sedentary farmers avid for land
who refuse to allow them to graze their herds even in temporarily
fallow fields.
Moreover, governments almost everywhere have adopted a
policy of settling nomads. They reproach them with being unruly,
with refusing progress, hygiene and the control of the legal
authorities, and with living in archaic social conditions. Nomads
are often accused of being pillagers and, worst sin of all, of con¬
tributing nothing to the national economy. In that respect, the great

droughts, by eliminating a section of the nomads, were not
unwelcome in the eyes of certain local politicians.
What tends to be forgotten is that the disappearance of the
nomads would leave large stretches of arid land completely void of
human life and unexploited, even though, if properly organized,
the nomads' herds could supply large quantities of meat and hides.
Although there is little likelihood that the great caravans of the past
will be seen again, some use of beasts of burden will doubtless con¬
tinue, since the rise in the price of oil and the cost of the upkeep of
roads and vehicles makes this form of transport competitive, par¬
ticularly when it is a matter of carrying produce and wares through
difficult, roadless terrain.
In Scandinavia and the USSR, the Lapps, the nomads of the
north who lead large herds of reindeer from the great northern
forest, in winter, to the Arctic tundra, in the summer, are now
prospering thanks to economic and social measures which have
made it possible for them to maintain a traditional though moder¬
nized way of life. This limited but nevertheless real nomadism
based on new methods of reindeer breeding offers an intense social
life and all the advantages of modern times. Without these people
the vast north would be empty and this would create many prob¬
lems, including those of territorial defence.
The position of the nomad in arid sub-tropical regions is not
unlike that of the Lapps. The raising of camels, cattle or smaller
livestock remains the keystone of their existence. Many solutions
have been proposed and sometimes applied, for modern develop¬
ment of the arid lands on the basis of extensive stock-farming
surveys of migration routes, the provision of strategically placed
watering points, continuous supervision and development of wells
and the areas around them, control of the movement of herds ac¬
cording to the grazing available, and rational organization of the
marketing of the various animal products such as meat, hides and
wool.
State intervention is essential because the nomad shepherds, for
the time being at least, are technically and financially unable to bear
the burden of up-dating their breeding methods. But States should
not set out to settle permanently the maximum number of nomadic
tribes. Transforming nomads into farmers often proves an impossi¬
ble task, not only because of the fundamental opposition between
herdsmen and farmers, but also because the very way of life and
traditions of the nomads militate strongly against any settled form
of existence. This can have far reaching effects. Experience in some
training centres, for example, has shown that it is easier to train
young people from nomad groups for industrial occupations than
for agriculture and that they often make better lorry-drivers than
rice or millet farmers.
Nomads are citizens like anyone else, a fact of which they are
very aware. They are also aware of the need for integration into
modern society, the main route to which is through literacy. Com¬
pulsory education is inscribed in the constitutions of most of the
countries bordering on the Sahara, and this applies as much to the
nomads as to anyone else. But they will have to be provided with
education in their own language, perhaps by a judicious use of the
radio and school sessions for young people at specific periods.
Another essential aspect of the modernization of nomadic life is
the organization of medical care.. Although their hardy existence
results in the survival of the fittest, the women are no longer
prepared to accept the very high infant mortality rates that are too
often the rule in nomad tribes. Vaccination, the fight against
endemic disease and emergency treatment for accident cases must
be coupled with the introduction of elementary public health
methods. The training of health officers of nomad origin and the
setting up of welfare centres near the wells, for example, could
change the lives of nomad herdsmen and alter their attitudes
towards government authorities by demonstrating that they are not
a rejected category of the rural population.
For thousands of years men maintained a certain equilibrium in
the great regions consisting of a combination of fertile, arid and
desert land, making the most of the sparse resources offered by
their natural surroundings. Today, the economic and social evolu¬
tion of the modern world has finally destroyed these fragile
structures.
Nomadism probably remains the only way of developing im¬
mense areas which would otherwise be devoid of human life. The
States concerned should bear this in mind in seeking to establish a
new equilibrium that might eventually lead to the survival and im¬
provement of the nomadic world.

Communication prize
to be awarded for 1st time
The McLuhan Teleglobe Canada
Award, an international prize for work in
communication, is to be presented for
the first time this year, under Unesco's
patronage. Worth 50,000 Canadian dol¬
lars and accompanied by a commemora¬

lished by the Canadian Commission for
Unesco in association with the Teleglobe
Canada Corporation. It will be awarded
every 2 years in recognition of work by
an individual or team making an excep¬
tional contribution to the better under¬
standing of the influence of communica¬
tions media and technology on society,
and in particular on cultural, artistic and
scientific life. A jury of Canadian citizens
will select winners from candidates
nominated by National Commissions for
Unesco. Deadline for submission of can¬
didates for 1983 is 31 July. Herbert

Unesco appeal
for Moenjodaro
The Director-General of Unesco, Mr.
Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, has launched
an international appeal for aid to safe¬
guard Moenjodaro, the 4,500-year-old
city-site of the ancient Indus valley civili¬
zation in Pakistan. Moenjodaro's out¬
standing remains are threatened with
total destruction by rising groundwater
containing mineral salts which are eating
away the brickwork, undermining foun¬
dations and corroding the walls of all the
buildings. In the past 20 years, thanks to
efforts by Pakistan which has financed
the major part of the work, and contribu¬
tions from an earlier Unesco appeal in
1974, much progress has been made in
implementing a three-point plan to lower
the water table, divert the course of the
Indus and remove the mineral salts, but
further contributions are needed if all the
plan's objectives are to be achieved.
Enormous resources are required to
achieve better control over the ground¬
water level and there is an urgent need
to restrain the Indus. A recurrence of
flooding such as that which struck Sind
Province in 1 973 could bury Moenjodaro
for ever.
Nobel prizewinner
appeals for
scientific responsibility
In an article published in the French
newspaper Le Monde on 9 March 1983,
Jean Dausset, winner of the 1 980 Nobel
Prize for Physiology and Medicine and
professor at the Collège de France,
launched an appeal in favour of the Uni¬
versal Movement for Scientific Respon¬
sibility, extracts from which we publish
below.
"At a time when every day brings its
tally of astounding new technological
exploits and its flood of human dramas,
we are becoming more and more aware
that we are living in the most exhilara¬
ting but also the most dangerous period
of the saga of mankind.
"There are those who, while enjoying
the benefits of scientific progress, feel a
certain nostalgia for the past, which
there has always been a tendency to
idealize. Many fear for the future and,
judging themselves to be unable to
change the course of events, withdraw
into a resigned passivity.
"Both these attitudes are irrational.
On the one hand, all knowledge is a form
of liberation. We cannot, and must not,
halt the march of science. On the other
hand/ we must have confidence in the
ability of mankind to find for itself the
paths to survival.
"In a finite world in disequilibrium, a
world which will soon be over-
populated, the scientist bears an increa¬
singly heavy weight of responsibility.
Sciences et Devenir de l'Homme
(Science and the Future of Man), the
French branch of the Universal Move¬
ment for Scientific Responsibility, aims
to awaken the awareness of scientists
and all those in positions of authority,
indeed, of all men, to the huge responsi¬
bility which is theirs.
"Scientists have, at times, been sus¬
pected and even openly accused of wan¬
ting to 'seize power'. In fact, their feel¬
ing is that the time has come to place
themselves at the service of society. In a
threatening world, no individual, no
single authority, no group appears cap¬
able of controlling the situation. A well-
informed, determined public opinion
seems likely to be the sole force able to
guarantee that wisdom prevail."
Archaeology
summer school
in Italy
As part of its efforts to develop world¬
wide co-operation among archaeologists
studying rock art, Italy's Centro Camuno
di Studi Preistorici (CCSP) is organizing a
summer school from 4 July to 8 August
1983. The school is being held at the
CCSP, at Valcamonica, where more than
180,000 prehistoric rock art figures
have been recorded. In collaboration
with Unesco, the CCSP is currently pre¬
paring a world inventory of rock art. For
further information about the summer
school, which includes exploration, field
research, lab work, projection of docu¬
mentaries, lectures, and debates, please
write to: Centro Camuno di Studi Preis¬
torici, 25044 Capo di Ponte (Bs.), Italy.
Studying non-violence
A two-week international course on
"Non-violence meanings, forms and
uses" is being held this summer under
Unesco auspices at the Inter-University
Centre of Postgraduate Studies (IUC) in
Ddbrovnik, Yugoslavia. The course,
from 26 June to 8 July, seeks to offer a
comprehensive view of non-violence
based on the writings and experience of
outstanding leaders from many parts of
the world. Enquiries should be addressed
to the IUC Secretariat (Frana Bulica 4,
YU-50,000 Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia) or to
one of the 2 course directors: Theodore
Herman (Peace and World Order Studies
Program, Colgate University, Hamilton,
N.Y. 13346, USAI and Nigel Young
(Hetton House, Hetton, Skipton, North
Yorkshire, England).
