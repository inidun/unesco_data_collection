interview Alain de Libera
naissance
French historian and philosopher
Alain de Libera, an authority on
medieval thought, talks to Ra chid
Sabbaghi about some unjustly
neglected chapters in the history of
Western philosophy.
How did you first become interested in Arab-
Islamic philosophy?
Alain de Libera: It was when I embarked on my
work asa historian of medieval philosophy. I rea d
a hook by the French philosopher and historian
Etienne Gilson called L'Etre et l'Essence ("Being
and Essence"), which contained two extraordi¬
nary, thought-provoking chapters on Avicenna and
Avernies. Ever since, my interest in Arab-Islamic
philosophy has been indissociable from my inter¬
est in medieval philosophy.
The received wisdom at the Sorbonne when
I was a student there was that the Middle Ages
were a kind of long parenthesis in the history of
humankind. The nineteenth-century French
scholar Ernest Renan called it an appalling
period, a "1,000-year disaster". The traditional
view insisted that nothing happened between
Aristotle and Descartes. As a philosophy stu¬
dent, then, I saw the Middle Ages as a neglected
period of history.
When I read Gilson's book, I realized that
at the core of this neglect was neglect of the
Arab-Islamic dimension within medieval philos¬
ophy. I then became convinced of two things:
first, that medieval thought as a whole had a
contribution to make to philosophy that was as
important as that of Greek or classical philoso¬
phy; and secondly, that a key reason why it was
overshadowed was the overshadowing of Arab-
Islamic philosophy, which I then approached
from the most difficult philosophical angle, the
metaphysical angle.
Was the contribution of Arab culture to the
making of modern Europe not overlooked as well?
A. de L: Yes, without doubt. But it must be said

that there was something diabolical in this
neglect, since it went hand in glove with the
recognition of a certain debt. This debt is often
referred to as though it should be taken for
granted, as when people say: "The existence of
an Arab-Islamic legacy is so obvious that there's
not much point in discussing it." The debt is so
patent that it distracts attention from the
neglect. People say: "Of course the Arabs passed
on the bulk of Greek science to the Christian
West." But we must be careful here: when it is
admitted, objectively and dispassionately, that
the Arabs were "transmitters", they are denied
any other role or any other contribution to the
overall history of Western thought. Recognition
of this kind, through a process of total assimi¬
lation, turns the Arabs into the continuation, in
another form, of the Greeks, into people whose
only role was to pass on what they had received,
just as relay runners hand over a baton or torch.
They passed on a science that was not theirs, a
science they simply reproduced and perpetu¬
ated. They passed it on, then stepped aside;
their job was done. They withdrew from the
European stage, where they had no business to
be and where they had never had anything to do
but serve as intermediaries.
Now this image is fallacious. The Arabs made
a much more important contribution to the his¬
tory of European thought than that.
How would you define this contribution?
A. de L: I should find it very hard to answer the
question: "What contribution did Greek phi¬
losophy make to the forming of a European iden¬
tity?". The question you have asked has equally
wide implications. The influence of such thinkers
as Avicenna and Averroës on European culture
is as vast a subject as that of Plato's or Aristotle's
influence. One is tempted to treat the subject
comprehensively, and looking at it in detail it is
hard to know where to begin. But I will try to sug¬
gest some basic guidelines.
Perhaps the simplest thing would be to start
with the notions of science and scientificity. In
the twelfth century the Christian world realized
that there existed a considerable corpus of sci¬
entific work in Antiquity (which had up to then
been lost or known only in a very fragmented and
indirect form) a systematic organization of
knowledge, a division of the sciences, a classifi¬
cation of scientific disciplines, an articulation, a
system, a hierarchy of disciplines. The West made
this discovery when the catalogue of sciences
drawn up by Al-Farabi was translated into Latin.
With Al-Farabi the Christian world obtained
its first signposts to the corpus of knowledge
bequeathed by late Antiquity organized so as
to provide a kind of map of the knowable. The
West then went on to make a detailed examina¬
tion of each of these sciences, which ranged from

interview astronomy and metaphysics to psychology, biol¬
ogy, botany and meteorology. In each case it dis¬
covered an Arabic text which, if it was not always
a founding text, had the effect of accompanying,
boosting or accelerating knowledge.
Between the end of the twelfth century and
the middle of the thirteenth century, the Latin
West became scientifically literate as a result of
two great batches of translations of Arab scien¬
tific works, which became the very foundation of
the university system. The medieval European
university, which came into being at the beginning
of the thirteenth century, was in a sense the insti¬
tutional manifestation of the map of knowledge
drawn by Al-Farabi. The Arab learning that was
translated and passed on to the West formed the
basis and the scientific foundation of the uni¬
versity in its living reality the reality of its syl¬
labus, the content of its teaching.
The historical paradox is that this Arab learn¬
ing, which never spawned a university in the
Islamic world itself, provided the Latin West
with the substance of an institution that enabled
it to develop rapidly and acquire a growing ascen¬
dancy over the rest of the world. The influence
ofthat learning was therefore quite inestimable.
It was not just a case of progress in this or that
field or discipline, or a specific contribution to
this or that aspect of an existing or nascent sci¬
ence. It was the very idea of the university and its
reality as an institution that grew out of the
Arabs' systematization of knowledge. If you want
to talk about the profound influence of Arab-
Islamic philosophy on the Latin West, you have
to approach the phenomenon from this angle,
from the notion that science, ideology and, to
some extent, history, the history of thought,
took shape in a unique institution, the university.
What about the disciplines themselves?
A. de L: I think a distinction needs to be made
. between two aspects of this question. As far as
the Middle Ages are concerned, one aspect of
the medieval output of knowledge is linked to an
activity which today seems very outmoded: the
commentary. There was a phenomenon that
might be called medieval "eommentarism";
medieval culture was based on texts. It is rea¬
sonable to assume that about half the texts read
and commented upon in medieval universities
were of Arab origin. There was the corpus of
Aristotelian physics and its Arab sequel, the cor¬
pus of Aristotle's De Anima (On the Soul) and its
Arab sequel, and the corpus of his Metaphysics
and its Arab sequel.
But the manner in which knowledge was trans¬
mitted is only one aspect of the question. It is
more important to see how new disciplines
emerged, how new knowledge was acquired, how
sciences came into being. At this point we leave
behind the aspect of "eommentarism" and the
transmission of texts, however interesting it may be,
as a phenomenon of another kind begins to emerge.
What kind of phenomenon?
A. de L: I deliberately referred to Aristotle's De
Anima. It would be stretching a point to describe
this as the founding text of psychology as a sci¬
ence. It presents an extraordinarily complex doc¬
trine of the soul, which was adapted, annotated
and partly rewritten over the centuries. In this
context, a work such as Averroës's great com¬
mentary on the De Anima is not just another
piece of annotation, but one that raises fresh
problems that bring out inconsistencies and gaps
in Aristotle's discourse. And the realization by
Averroës that Aristotle's work led nowhere, that
there were residual difficulties in his system
or what was assumed to be a system and that
the very formulation of his founding principle
was faulty means that Averroës had something
more to contribute than annotation or commen¬
tary. He caused the very foundations of philos¬
ophy to be questioned.
This being the case, the issue cannot be
approached from a purely quantitative point of
view. One cannot simply say that Averroës added
200 pages to Aristotle's 100. What Averroës
added was the astute perception that Aris-
totelianism is something that had to be built, that
it was not "ready-made", and consequently, that
the science of the soul had to be built. Its funda¬
mental tools and its broadest concepts needed to
be defined. As soon as Averroës became known,
there was a debate about what the science of the
soul might be. Before Averroës, what Aristotle
had said was simply repeated and reproduced.
I insist on this point because Averroës is usu¬
ally made out to be no more than a commentator
on Aristotle. In fact he was more than this, lie
In ancient Greece, the wise man tried to grasp eternal verities, by detaching himself to some
extent from the material world. For Averroës, the ivise man should know things as they are,
going into the detail of a changing ivorld. . . .

certainly repeated what his predecessor said in
some areas, but always with the aim of develop¬
ing a body of knowledge that obeyed the model
of science as Averroës defined it a model that
was essentially demonstrative and strongly argued
from a logical point of view, a model that sought
to be consistent and systematic. It may conse¬
quently be said that it was Averroës who, in a
sense, invented the science of psychology,
The European individual as a type came into being at the
heart of the medieval world, prompted by the notion
which is not Greek but Arabicthat work liberates.
whereas all Aristotle did was pass on the corpus
and the terms on which the science would be
built.
What did Averroës contribute to psychology apart
from the idea that it could become a science?
A. de L: He contributed the basis on which he
tried to create that science, namely the critique
of materialism. It was important in his eyes to rec¬
ognize psychical reality as such, as something
thoroughly independent, autonomous and sepa¬
rate from the biological sphere (what today we
would tend to call the materialist sphere). He
made a distinction between the theory of thought
and the theory of cerebral functions. He believed
there was an absolute moral irreducibility
between the physical world and the "noetic"
world i.e. the psychological and cognitive
processes, scientific thought itself. He strove to
put across a view that preserved Aristotelian
empiricism as far as possible, but diverged from
it when that empiricism tended to reduce
thought to its material elements alone.
Averroës posed the question of the psycho¬
logical subject, the thinking subject. And he
posed it by criticizing any interpretation that
might reduce the soul and thought to products
of the body, to forms secreted by the body. lie
regarded the psychological subject as indepen¬
dent of its corporal substratum.
What theory did he propose?
A. de L: He set up a model that the history of psy¬
chology has shown to be immensely fruitful
what might be called a topological model. He
tried to see the act of knowing in terms of ele¬
ments that are neither corporal nor non-corporal,
but purely psychical what he called the intel¬
lect. In the intellect, he distinguished between
a passive dimension which receives concepts, and
an active dimension which produces those con¬
cepts. There is therefore an interaction between
three agencies imagination, receptiveness and
activity.
So Averroës proposed a theory which,
although it broke away from materialism, was
not a theory of the individual subject, of the
thinking ego, of what Descartes would later
describe as "the thinking being". Averroës did his
best to steer clear of the twin pitfalls of materi¬
alism and psychologism.
When students say to me: "What on earth is
all this talk of active intellect and passive intel¬
lect? What does it mean?", I reply: "What is
the ego, what is the super-ego?" They are not
entities that can be located in the brain, nor arc
they egos within the ego. They are agencies that
form part of a dynamic vision of the psyche. I
believe that if people could think in this way
about Averroës, they would appreciate his rad¬
ical novelty: the introduction of a model that
was unknown before him. His approach involved
finding a space which is neither that of materi¬
ality (the corporeal), nor that of an ego entirely
in control of itself and of its conscious acts. It may
be a little difficult to grasp, but it does seem to
me that this topological model of the soul, which
was unknown before Averroës, has not yet yielded
all its riches.
In your book Penser au Moyen-Age, you even put
forward the theory of an Arab contribution to the
appearance of the European mentality. You suggest
that Arab culture could have made possible the
emergence of that curious creature which
subsequently conquered the world: the modern
individual.
A. de L: Let's start with the notion of the intel¬
lectual. An intellectual is someone who lives in a
specific institution, the university, and has a spe¬
cific task, which is to understand, to find out, to
know and to act within the general framework of
a practice which is that.of the scientist. In the
ancient Greek world, the wise man adopted a con¬
templative attitude. He wanted to find out the
intelligible structure of reality by detaching him¬
self to some extent from the material world, the
world of sensations and appearances. This is the
thoroughgoing Platonism of ancient philosophy,
which is found even in Aristotelianism, since the
ideal of the wise man, as expressed by Aristotle in
his Nicomacheun Ethics, is summed up in a sin¬
gle Greek word: theoria, i.e. "contemplation". A
man of this kind lives a life of leisure: he is wealthy
and has a small circle of friends. He does not work
and he is free.
What fresh contribution does the Arab-
Islamic vision of the wise man make to this

interview model? I would say that in a sense it rehabili¬
tates the work of the intellectual. Intellectuals
no longer contemplate eternal intelligible struc¬
tures, but know things as they are, going into
the detail, reality and substance of a changing
world that has its own reality and consistency
and is subject to a number of laws. Not a sepa¬
rate and eternal world, but this world, in all its
cohesion, beauty, organization and structure. So
where is the dividing line between work and con¬
templation? It does not exist, because it is impos¬
sible to be involved in the science of optics or
medicine, or to investigate certain meteorologi¬
cal phenomena, without observing, seeking, inves¬
tigating, looking, working and organizing. This is
particularly true of optics, which was the great
triumph of Arab science and its finest export to
the Latin world.
Was this change of perspective also a change in
the way people related to work?
A. de L: Yes. Finding out about things is work.
But it is not a constricting experience. Far from
it, it has a liberating effect. It does not belong to
what were known as the mechanical arts, those
"adulterous" arts which ended up enslaving
humans to matter instead of liberating them.
The whole relationship between scientific work
Avicenna contributed an idea of extraordinary novelty

scientist and the prophet. Knowing in order to gain

and the contemplative attitude is thus radically
altered. And it was in the universities that this
new type of intellectual most thrived.
I would say that the emergence of the indi¬
vidual began when the relationship between wis¬
dom and knowledge, and between contempla¬
tion and work, was completely redefined.
Universities were able to expand because they
were societies of individuals effectively linked by
a whole series of reciprocal services and social
obligations. The scientific ideal, the ideal of
shared knowledge, of a community of lives based
on the communication of knowledge and on the
joint discovery of the reality of things all these
went far to shape the individual. In this context,
individuals are neither aristocrats living off their
resources and savouring from time to time the
joys of intellectual contemplation, nor wretches
enslaved by the demands of their jobs, but mem
bers of a society of human beings who have gath¬
ered to share a moral code, a task and an ideal.
Obviously this ideal does not at first concern
the whole of society. But it is already a model.
The modern notion of the individual does not
really come into its own until there is an overall
social dimension, until there is a general society
of individuals, a civil society which parts company
with the medieval world of hierarchies, obliga¬
tions and highly codified social roles.
Universities helped to bring about the tran¬
sition from one world to the other. They were
laboratories in which the notion of the European
individual was invented. The latter is always
defined as someone who strikes a balance
between culture, freedom and enterprise, some¬
one who has the capacity to show initiative and
innovate. As it happens, and contrary to a widely
held view, this new type of person came into
being at the heart of the medieval university
world, prompted by the notion which is not
Greek but Arabic that work liberates.
Can you be more specific about this non-Greek
notion?
A. de L: It is the idea, developed notably by Al-
Farabi and Avicenna, which holds that the act of
knowing, the work of the scientist, generates
wisdom. After Avicenna, the Latins eventually
adopted this theory, according to which the
philosopher and the prophet come together in a
single temperament. It is the idea of natural
prophecy. For the Latins it becomes synonymous
with knowing in order to gain foresight. It is not
prophetic revelation; it is the ability to say what
must happen on the basis of one's knowledge of
the reality of things. In other words, it is nat¬
ural, not supernatural, prophecy.
This is an extraordinary novelty: the recon¬
ciliation in one and the same person of the sci¬
entist and the natural prophet. It takes us to
the origins of the new conception of European
science, science which is neither purely con¬
templative nor purely technical, but presup¬
poses a reconciliation of the two.
Could you briefly outline for us the successive
stages of your philosophy as expounded in your three
major works, Penser au Moyen-Age, la Philosophie
Médiévale and Averroës et l'averroïsme?
A. de L: In/lrerroës et l'uverroïsme, I wanted to
write a little book that would show more sympa¬
thy for its subject than Renan did when he wrote
about Averroës in the last century. My idea was to
give an account of the multiplicity of Averroës's
legacies and filiations. I devoted a lot of space to
Jewish Averro'ism, because I wanted to show that
while Averroës's influence on posterity was wide-

The idea that philosophy originated in Greece and made its way directly to the minds of 19th-
century German thinkers does not hold water. I have tried to rehabilitate the Arab and Jewish
contribution to that historythe forgotten legacy.

ranging, it was particularly strong on Jewish think¬
ing. It could be said that a good deal of medieval
Jewish philosophy, and certainly its most original
side, came in Averroës's wake. Penser au Moyen
Age was written in a different, freer and more
personal way. Sometimes it is more aggressive,
and sometimes more ironical.
What is the book's thesis?
A. de L: After making a diagnosis of the
deplorable state of political debate in France
as regards Islam and the Arab world, based on
observation of the devastating effect on people's
minds of Jean-Marie Le Pen's ideology in partic¬
ular and of xenophobic ideology in general, and
on a realization that the Arab world was being
mixed up with the Muslim world, and both of
them associated with a hotchpotch of fanati¬
cism, intolerance and ignorance, I said to myself
that the prime task of the historian was perhaps
to recall what the "forgotten legacy" had been.
That is the subject of one chapter of the
book, and although there are other chapters I
think it represents the core of the book. My aim
was to draw attention to European culture's pro¬
found and usually overlooked debt to the Arab-
Islamic legacy, or Andalusian model, as it has
also been called. As a result my book, which
aimed to give the Middle Ages a new place in the
history of European culture and in the making of
the European identity, focused on a crucial
moment in history the Arab-Islamic moment.
La Philosophie Médiévale is an academic
account of what Penser au Moyen Age sets forth
in a polemical form. It is based entirely on the
notion that philosophy did not die out with the
Greeks. The history of philosophy between late
Antiquity and the end of the Middle Ages needs
to be seen in terms of a shift in the centres of
study, a kind of migration. Philosophy was a
migratory bird which left the East Baghdad
in the ninth century A.D. and, after making its
way along the Mediterranean, moved up through
Andalusia into northern Europe, where it finally
reached the land of its choice. But it never died
out in any of the places it traversed during its cen¬
turies-long journey.
Basically I wanted to show that the history of
philosophy based on the Graeco-German myth,
which holds that philosophy originated in Greece
and made its way directly to the minds of nine
teenth-century German thinkers simply does
not hold water. Embarking on a perfectly nor¬
mal process of academic research, I set out to
rehabilitate the Arab and Jewish contribution to
that history, in other words the forgotten legacy.
How does your most recent book, Saint-Thomas
d'Aquin contre Averroës, fit into this scheme of
things?
A. de L: It throws light on a particular moment
in the process whereby Averroës was accepted by
the Latin West, the moment when two models
of psychology openly confronted each other
Averroës's model, which I attempted to describe
above (and which is based on a rejection of both
materialism and the Cartesian cogito), and
Thomas Aquinas's theory, which was closer to
Aristotle. Aquinas defended Aristotle against
Averroës, whom he accused of having been a cor¬
rupter as well as a commentator, and turned back
to Aristotle as someone who exalted the person
and personal thought, the ego and the I, against
what Aquinas regarded as Averroës's scandalous
claim that there is such a thing as transperson-
ality of thought.
What I wanted to do was to give an account
of probably the best and most powerful critique
of Averroës produced during the Middle Ages.
And, because I so much enjoy working on Aver¬
roës, I also wanted to describe what form anti-
Averroism could take.
What are your plans for the future?
A. de L: I have several projects. The main one
that concerns us here is a translation of Aver¬
roës's commentary on Aristotle's De Anima. As
you know, the commentary has survived only in
Latin. The original Arabic version has been lost,
and the Hebrew translation is based on the Latin.
The Latins pass on to us something that was
passed on to them and which no longer exists
anywhere else: there could be no better illus¬
tration of the silences of history. When trans¬
lating the text, I shall do my best to make sure
that it does not come across as a kind of anti¬
quated curiosity, but as a high point in the his¬
tory of psychology. I shall try to make a modern
interpretation of it, using the instruments appro¬
priate to the kind of debate and discussion that
currently focuses on the relationship between
body and soul.

Radio's bright future
by Bahgat Elnadi and Adel Rifaat
Radio, which recently celebrated its centenary, is widely undervalued. Peo¬
ple tend to forget how far it helped to shape ways of thinking in the twen¬
tieth century and to minimize the role it is earmarked to play in the
twenty-first.
The radio age ushered in a perception of the world in global terms,
something that now seems self-evident but which drastically changed
parish-pump mentalities and linked the destinies of villages and city dis¬
tricts alike to the unfolding events of our turbulent century. It was over the
airwaves that news of revolutions, coups d'état and wars came to the illit¬
erate populations of the Nile and Ganges deltas, and that Indian, African
and Caribbean music was widely heard in Paris and London for the first
time. Ubiquitous, quick to purvey news based on a diversity of sources,
radio brought a new area of experience to all countries and every social class.
It would be hard to over-emphasize the important part the new medium
played in the spread of democratic pluralism.
All well and good, one might say. Let's bury radio under a mass of vale¬
dictory flowers and leave it at that. Radio blazed the trail for television and
tomorrow's information superhighways. It has a glorious past but no future.
This is not true. Just as the globalization of financial and technologi¬
cal flows will not dissolve national identities and local cultures, so tele¬
vision will not replace books or kill radio. It is a fact that old habits are going
by the board, and familiar landmarks are disappearing. Various kinds of ret¬
rogression are in the air. But the further our antennae extend and the fur¬
ther afield we look, the greater our need for roots.
In this issue, Hervé Bourges notes that radio will continue to be indis¬
pensable "to cover news in each world region, in each country, in real time"
and to enable young people to keep their finger on the "musical pulse" of
their choice. In short, it will go on providing people with thefreedom to make
their own considered personal choices from an increasingly wide range of
possibilities.
Paradoxically, one advantage of radio is that it is not accompanied by
the image. The chief quality of the TV imagethat it seems so realistic
is actually its main flaw because it inhibits our imagination and our capac¬
ity to stand back and think. We shall always need sound without image as
part of our right to interpret for ourselves, as we tune in to the morning news,
the meaning of world events.

ON THE CREST OF
THE WAVES
Ln antenna fixed to a mast,
near Antibes in southern
France (1901). I ith hindsight, the coming of
wireless seems to have been
inevitable, like that of most
great modern inventions. It
was announced almost simultaneously in two
places in Russia by Aleksandr Popov, and
in Italy by Guglielmo Marconi.
Initially, as its name indicates, wireless was
a system of long-distance communication with¬
out wires. Transmitted in real time, the radio
signal defies distance, geographical barriers and
geopolitical frontiers. Ubiquitous and instan¬
taneous, radio was the first technological man¬
ifestation of a virtual reality whose mysteries are
still being explored today. It took a generation
before its cultural significance was fully per¬
ceived. At first transmitting the language of
telegraphy, it was soon being used in the mer¬
chant navy, in aviation and above all in the
armed forces, where it had many applications.
Broadcasting only became an important
medium of mass communication in the indus¬
trialized countries in the late 1920s; the trend
was reinforced in the following decade. The
expansion of radio was steamrollered by two
very powerful forces that are still at work.
One was industrial development; the other
was political and commercial propaganda.
From crystal set
to satellite
The development of radio as a medium of
mass communication was shaped to a large
extent by the arrival on the market of succes¬
sive generations of receivers.
The valve receiver, which replaced the pio¬
neering crystal set, was a heavy piece of walnut
or rosewood drawing-room furniture. What
did it matter if amplitude modulation (AM)
coverage (on medium wave, long wave and short
wave) was still somewhat hit and miss? Radio
was entering the home at the speed of sound.

In the United States, big companies like
RCA broadcast musicals featuring the stars
of Broadway. While the cinema was still silent
radio hummed to the rhythms of jazz and
ragtime. In Europe, where post and telecom¬
munications ministries monopolized the air¬
waves, programmes tended to be more for¬
mal concerts from the Royal Albert Hall,
classics from the Comédie-Française, and deco¬
rous tea dances.
But on both sides of the Atlantic a new
social ritual came in as people gathered to lis¬
ten to the wireless. In the 1950s the TV set
would become the focal point of a similar
kind of convivial relationship.
Reaching
a world audience
The transistor radio came on the scene in the
early 1 960s, when the TV set was gradually tak¬
ing the place of the radio in the home. Along
with the record player, it soon became a cult
object of the consumer society. Cheap enough
to be a mass-produced instrument of personal
entertainment, it was a symbol of teenage eman¬
cipation in the rich countries. From the North
Sea pirate stations to the studio that appears
in the film American Graffiti, a whole genera¬
tion celebrated its values, its counter-culture
and its music (rock) on the air.
The cheapness of transistor sets also made
radio the mass medium best suited to the poor
countries, above all in regions where distances
and infrastructural weakness meant that com¬
munication had to take place over the airwaves.
At the same time, radio became mobile.
This was the age of the car radio. Soon, fre¬
quency modulation (FM) was encouraging
programme proliferation, neighbourhood
radio stations and audience segmentation. The
extent of the latter, especially in the United
States, seems to have gone so far that it is hard
to know what people really do listen to.
Will the time come when radio no longer
federates distant audiences and different socio-
cultural backgrounds? Will digital broadcast¬
ing turn it into an elite medium, for exam¬
ple? Some European manufacturers seem to
be opting for systems such as digital audio
broadcasting (DAB), which offer high defin¬
ition sound and multimedia services, but
require far more expensive receivers. Perhaps
consumers will make different choices.
Broadcasting policies have followed the
main trends of twentieth-century history so

closely that they are almost mirrors of our
time. The turning point came during the
period of reconstruction after the Second
World War, when governments realized that
audiovisual communication was a key instru¬
ment in public life, a sensitive area that ought
to be controlled in the public interest.
From monopolies
to pluralism
After first national, then international, allo¬
cation of frequencies came the development
of state radio systems. Once the age of total¬
itarian illusions was over propaganda radio
stations became champions of sovereignty and
in some cases supporters of national libera¬
tion movements.
Public audiovisual networks put out pro¬
grammes containing a mix of light entertain¬
ment, news and educational broadcasting

culture. They were organized in different ways
in different countries: kept under relatively
close supervision by the executive in countries
such as France, Spain and Portugal; shared
between political parties (Italy); air time
divided between voluntary service and reli¬
gious groups (The Netherlands); separate ser¬
vices for different language communities
(Switzerland and Belgium).
This kind of regulatory set-up came to

prevail on almost all the continents, except
North America. Over two centuries ago the
United States wrote into its constitution an
amendment which prevents congress from leg¬
islating to establish a religion or abridge free¬
dom of speech or the press. To appreciate the
astonishingly progressive nature of such a pro¬
vision, it is hardly necessary to recall that royal
or imperial censorship existed in most Euro¬
pean states at that time and that censors vio¬
lated the secrecy of private correspondence as
well as keeping tabs on printed matter.
The fourth
estate
Audiovisual regulatory frameworks in Europe
are not totally consonant with an American-
style liberal approach. Their foundations were
laid pragmatically. The Board of Governors
of the BBC, the body responsible for guar¬
anteeing the independence of public broad¬
casting in the United Kingdom, may have
served as a model, but it was the development
of FM radio, and later of commercial television
in Italy that really set things moving. Politi¬
cal authorities soon came to realize that
monopolies were rapidly becoming obsoles¬
cent and that anarchy threatened. Most coun-

tries set up systems designed to separate the
audiovisual media from the state.
The criteria varied from country to coun¬
try. The United Kingdom put licences up for
auction; the French went in for pluralism; the
countries of Africa and Asia created institu¬
tions designed to guarantee the implementa¬
tion of a multi-party system and protect
national cultural identities. Democratic change
was thus transposed into the field of the
audiovisual industry.
Digital radio
People often talk of the golden age of radio, as
if this hundred-year-old medium were out of
date. The fact is, however, that in the South as
well as in the North radio, like the written
word, has remained an incomparably vital
medium, which others can complement with¬
out ever being able to replace.
It is true that satellites are bringing to tele¬
vision some of the qualities of radio such as
instantaneous transmission and planetary cov¬
erage. But no TV news channel, however pow¬
erful it may be, will be able to cover news in each
¡ Bolivian youth listens

his earnings. world region, in each country, in real time, as
radio does. Satellite music channels can never
keep their finger on the pulse of rapidly chang¬
ing tastes. Young people find the music they
want on the FM band of radio. It will be a long
time before television becomes interactive and
hands over the microphone to the public except
in specially staged circumstances.
But radio is also adapting to the age of
satellites and digital communication. On the
Internet, some information services are already
o ffering a combination of written and audio
material. Radio France Internationale, for
example, can now be picked up all over the
world on a multimedia personal computer.
Soon, individual receivers with low-cost dish
antennae will make it possible to receive in
digital form, anywhere in the world, the main
international radio networks relayed by geo¬
stationary satellites; the same signal will be
able to transmit complementary data to screens
with liquid crystals.
And so, in the age of multimedia and on¬
line communication, there is still plenty of
room for radio.

THE SECOND HALF CENTURY
A continuing struggle for access to the airwaves
Uuring the Hungarian
uprising in 1956, crowds
gathered to air their demands
outside the Radio Budapest
building, its façade pitted with
gunfire (above). R
adio has an image problem. It lacks
the maturity of the newspaper
industry and the modernity of tele¬
vision. Unlike the newspaper, radio
has to be understood immediately and unlike
TV it lacks an appeal to young people attracted
more to visual images in an increasingly multi¬
media world. And yet it continues to hold the
largest audiences of all media and it has been
party to the most dramatic political develop¬
ments during the past half century.
National radio stations have had an enor¬
mous impact on the political lives of their cit¬
izens. Was it not Moscow Radio which broad¬
cast Khruschev's message to Kennedy in which
he anounced the dismantling of Russian rocket
bases in Cuba? Egyptian radio broadcast Pres¬
ident Nasser's announcement of the national¬
ization of the Suez Canal, Hungarian radio
reported the crushing of the Hungarian revo
lution, Czech radio reported the demise of
the "Prague Spring".
Nothing, however, allows radio to give
greater value than times of crisis or war. The
Gulf War was dubbed the first war to be con¬
ducted in the media. It has always been
assumed that the media in this context meant
TV. According to research, however, the first
source of knowledge that war had broken out
in the Arab States was "word of mouth" for
the majority of people in Egypt, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Radio sur¬
passed TV in all three of these countries as a
source of further information.
But when a normally credible station such
as the BBC is based in a country which gets
involved in a crisis such as the Gulf War it too
can be mistrusted. "If an uneducated person
hears the news on the BBC, he'll believe it even
if it's wrong . . . they can start rumours	" And

so we are back with accusations of propaganda,
with the eternal philosophical debate concern¬
ing the existence of objectivity. Perhaps it is
easier for the pragmatic journalist to aim for the
slightly different goal of credibility.
Jamming the airwaves
It is the fear of an audience believing a radio sta¬
tion which leads to jamming of the airwaves, a
phenomenon that came to its height during the
cold war of a communist era that only eased off
in 1985 with the accession to power of Presi¬
dent Gorbachev. Jamming by the Soviet Union
in the early 1980s was calculated to cost $800
million per year because the jammer has to trans¬
mit a blocking noise as strong as the incoming
signal and even then some signal does get
through. It was always difficult to cut off the lis¬
tener determined to receive the broadcasts.

of communism is more complex. After the acci¬
dent at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in
the Soviet Union in August 1986, Radio Liberty
carried out an audience research investigation in
order to establish how listeners had discovered
the facts about the crisis. More respondents
quoted Western radio stations as their prime
source than those watching Russian TV. A
majority of the sample who had first heard of it
on TV switched to Western radio for added
knowledge. In some post-communist coun¬

in reporting a major crisis. Even during the
Bosnian conflict, the Bulgarian media were heav¬
ily reliant on reports from the West because
they could not afford to send correspondents
to the war arena next door to them.

but it has many participants. In Francophone

the airwaves but they face stiff competition
from the Soviet Union, China, South Africa,
Germany, the U.S.A. and the U.K. In recent
years, rebroadcasting of international radio ser¬
vices on national networks as well as on cable
systems has increased considerably.
In this age of satellites it is now difficult to
imagine the problems of radio transmission in
earlier days, particularly the problem of world¬
wide reception. Short-wave transmissions faced
obstacles galore limited range, the sun, ionos¬
pheric storms, the seasons. Today's obstacle is
congestion of the airwaves.
From the listener's point of view, how¬
ever, the invention of the transistor in the
1950s was particularly important in revolu¬
tionizing radio. Until then the majority of
sets were in Europe and North America. The
transistor opened up listening in sub-Saharan
Africa, in China and in India from an esti¬
mated 2.5 million sets to 90 million sets in the
space of twenty years after 1956.
In the last twenty years alone radio set
ownership has doubled again around the
world and even today the potential for growth
is incredible. There arc over twice as many radio
sets in existence as there are TV monitors.
The rise of local
broadcasting
The interesting fact about even transfrontier
broadcasting is that in any one country lis¬
tening to broadcasts from international oper¬
ators always peaks when the national or ver¬
nacular languages are used. And this is why
local broadcasting has now come into its own.
One has only to consider the number of
languages used in some countries to realize that
TV cannot compete with radio in servicing
multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic audiences. In
some emerging democracies, strenuous efforts
are made to embrace the linguistic maze. In
Namibia, for example, the constitutional prob¬
lem of language was solved by adopting only
one language English. But NBC, the national
broadcaster, caters for the real linguistic needs
of Namibian listeners with seven services in all
including the major indigenous languages and
Afrikaans. In neighbouring South Africa, eleven
languages are given equal status in the consti¬
tution. Radio copes with all eleven, while TV
struggles to embrace but a few.
It is difficult for TV to reflect national cul-

tural mosaics. Radio is better able to embrace
the national cultures, in music as well as in the
spoken word. The demand for music, whether
classical, folk or pop, gives an option to peo¬
ple's lives which can only be satisfied on radio.
A sense of place
All the same, there are limitations to the num¬
ber of languages which radio can cope with. It
is unrealistic to even consider the possibility
of all of Papua New Guinea's tens of dozens of
languages getting airtime in the short run. There
are also worries that tribal differences in Africa
or ethnic divisions in the former Yugoslavia
have led to the development of radio of the
worst possible kind. It is for governments to
promote the media in a regulated way within
the context of a democratic society.
There are legitimate needs within each state

which do not necessarily conform to the state
boundaries. This is where national radio's role
in several countries has been challenged by the
strengthening of local commercial radio pro¬
viding services in local languages and a greater
depth of national and local identity. This is
an important concept best dubbed "a sense of
place" and it is the very antithesis of trans¬
frontier broadcasting. In 1996, the retiring
chairman of the European Broadcasting
Union's Programme committee, Geraint Stan¬
leyjones, delivered an important lecture which
embraced the essence of the argument:
"Broadcasters have a special role in main¬
taining a culture and cherishing identity," he
said, "for it is not just, indeed it may not even
be principally about information. It is as much
about culture music, art, education, language
and so forth. At its best it reflects back to a
community the richness which that commu¬
nity contains. There is no other medium which
can do it; and at the end of the twentieth cen¬
tury if public service broadcasters don't do it
other broadcasters will swamp the airwaves
with other messages. I would now argue that
credibility in broadcasting, requiring as it does
identity between the broadcaster and his or her
audience, also now requires much more atten¬
tion to be paid to cultural differences than to
national mass. In a Europe with fewer national
boundaries people will be freer to develop and
deploy their local identities as part of the
broader whole. And broadcasting needs to
reflect and celebrate and foster that. It can only
be public service broadcasters who will do it."
But public broadcasting has to be carefully
defined because it is not always to be found in
the state or national broadcaster, certainly as far
as independent journalism is concerned. One
of the basic problems facing journalistic inde¬
pendence in most countries of the world dur¬
ing the past half century is the repressive atti¬
tude of the governments of new states, often
termed emerging democracies, towards their
own national or local media.
Threats to independent
reporting
When the "winds of change" released dozens
of countries in Africa and Asia, the South
Pacific and the Caribbean from the bonds of
colonialism in the 1950s and 1960s, few
emerged successfully either as true democracies
or with anything other than large state radio
stations tied to a government information
policy. The majority of countries even today
have retained these large state broadcasters who
have a valuable role to play in the "nation-
building" process albeit at the expense of inde¬
pendent journalism. They have contributed
to the struggle for better health and hygiene in
development and educational programming. In

that sense they have had an important role as
a public broadcaster but one deprived of inde¬
pendence in reporting on government itself.
The irony of that situation is that it has
been left to the emerging private radio stations
to test the waters of actual reporting in its truest
sense. Similarly, the major feature of the 1990s
in the post-communist world has been the dif¬
ficulty of persuading governments which claim
to be democratic that independent media are
the prerequisite for good government and
underpin a truly democratic nation. Such a sea-
change requires media which stop being mes¬
sengers for politicians and start servicing the
audiences who elect those politicians. In other
words, journalists should report on govern¬
ment performance between elections.
It is a difficult enough task to get this mes¬
sage across in all the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) in their difficult
transformation from communism to free mar¬
ket economies. It is even more difficult in coun¬
tries such as Bosnia and Serbia where hate is
ingrained on all sides. In the emerging democ¬
racies the hope for independent journalism lies
not with the state "public" broadcasters but
with the small private and commercial operators
who dare to take a different approach. It is they
who build credibility and therefore audiences.
Unfortunately there are all too few coun¬
tries even today which allow for freedom of
speech. While journalists in the more sophis¬
ticated democracies tend to indulge in varying
degrees of self-censorship, those in emerging
democracies have little pretence to subtlety
when interviewing their favourites. But there
are those even worse off, such as the journal¬
ist in one country I shall not name who, when
asked by a Western journalist in 1992 whether
he submitted questions in advance for a min¬
isterial interview, answered "No, the Minister
gives me the questions. And if I change the
script I could be shot". In fairness to journal¬
ists paid by governments, they cannot be
expected to report on their paymasters.
The clash between ideology and idealism
will continue for years to come, complicated by
the increased pressures on public broadcasting
on the one hand and commercial survival or
profit on the other. The good news is that the
choice of radio channels available to audiences
throughout the world is rising every day.
A PUBLIC
SERVICE
BYKNUDEBBESEN
Public service broadcasting means providing a service to the
public in all its diversity, not only to important or interesting
parts of the public.
Its implications were well defined by the President of the
European Broadcasting Union, Professor Albert Scharf, when
he said: "Public service programming calls for such duties as
accuracy, reliability, objectivity, truthfulness in disseminat¬
ing facts, honesty and fairness of comment, impartiality in all
matters of public controversy. Majorities have to be reflected
as such; silent minorities must also be respected as such, i.e.
the right balance must be found. This does not, however, exclude
commitment to new ideas and unthought thoughts; it does
not prohibit provocation. On the contrary, the trust that broad¬
casters must serve includes a commitment to promote inno¬
vations and new trends, to advance the creativity that is hid¬
den within society."
For the British broadcaster David Attenborough, "Public
service broadcasting is not just a schedule with a peppering of
good programmes, nor is it a broadcaster with claims to a
social conscience. It is a system which strives to provide the
widest possible range of programmes and is enabled to do so
by being beholden neither to commerce on the one hand nor gov¬
ernment on the other. . . . Public service broadcasting, uniquely,
can thus be free from pap on the one hand and propaganda on
the other".
The editorial and political freedom of a public service broad¬
casting organization has to be defined in its charter and secured
by legislation. Its funding also has to be considered carefully and
no method or combination of methods is ideal. Even limited
dependence on advertising revenue creates a conflict of inter¬
est, diverting broadcasters from public service standards. Licence
fee funding has fewer drawbacks than other methods but can only
be introduced in countries where the general public has suffi¬
cient paying power.
Even where appropriate legislation has been passed and
an adequate funding mechanism exists, governments some¬
times find it difficult to abandon control of the media. They fear
public criticism and find ways to encourage self-censorship
among broadcasters and management.
The public service concept of radio broadcasting has proved
to be a valuable toolin supporting the continuing struggle for
democracy and people's participation in social development at
both local and national level.

FROM SHORT WAVE TO SATELLITE
Do satellite and digital radio
spell the end of short-wave radio?
For almost seventy years, short-wave
transmission has been the most effi¬
cient method of delivering pro¬
grammes across long distances. Today,
however, the development of new technologies
such as satellite transmission, digital audio
broadcasting and interactive two-way cable is
forcing many international broadcasters to
reconsider the choice of short wave as their
principal medium for the future.
The phenomenon known as "short-wave
radio" is actually the result of a combination
of transmission technology and the electro¬
magnetic properties of the earth's atmosphere.
Just as the waves of the ocean are caused by
the vibration of water molecules, radio waves
result from the vibration of electromagnetic
particles. The rate at which they vibrate is much
faster than that of ocean waves several thou¬
sand times per second, or even several hun¬
dred thousand times per second.
The number of vibrations (or cycles) per
second is the frequency of the wave. The cycle
per second is named the hertz (abbreviated
Hz) after the German physicist Heinrich
Hertz. The higher the frequency of a radio
wave, the shorter its wavelength the distance
between two consecutive cycles. Radio waves
of different lengths are used for different pur¬
poses, because they have distinct physical

properties. Radio stations are allocated fre¬
quencies according to a system ratified by a
series of international conventions. They are
often identified by their number on the dial,
which corresponds to a frequency in kilohcrtz
(kHz) or megahertz (MHz).
Hopping round
the earth
Short-wave transmissions are in the frequency
range of 3 to 30 MHz. They are used for inter¬
national broadcasting because their physical
and electromagnetic characteristics (wavelength,
energy level, etc.) allow them to be reflected
by the ionosphere, a layer of electrically
charged particles in the upper atmosphere.
Unlike domestic broadcast transmissions,
which are beamed at the horizon and cover a
broad but local area, international short-wave
broadcasts are pointed at the sky. When a radio
wave emitted from a transmitting antenna hits
the ionosphere, it "bounces" back towards
the earth. This is called a "hop", and carries
the signal a distance between 2,000 and 4,000
kilometres.
The wave is then reflected back towards the
ionosphere by the earth's surface, making
another "hop" as it again returns to earth.
After several "hops" the signal can reach the
other side of the globe. The more powerful
the transmitter, the farther the signal can travel.
But the ionosphere also causes problems
for long-distance broadcasts. The generation of
radio waves in the ionosphere is strongly
affected by the time of day, the season and
sunspot activity. Small but rapid changes in
the ionosphere's altitude and makeup alter its
reflecting abilities, affecting the quality of
reception.
Static also interferes with short-wave recep¬
tion. It can be caused by electrical charges such
as those produced by ignition systems in auto¬
mobile and aircraft engines. But lightning is the
most common culprit. Radio frequency inter¬
ference produced by these atmospheric dis¬
charges can travel thousands of kilometres.
Since there is almost always a thunderstorm
somewhere within a few thousand kilometres
of any radio, static is a constant disturbance.
This is why short-wave broadcasters often
send the same programme simultaneously on
several frequencies, and periodically change
these frequencies. But as a consequence, the

spectrum of frequencies is often overloaded,
increasing the likelihood of interference and
restricting the introduction of new services.
Technological innovations and improved
co-operation among countries are now mak¬
ing it possible for international broadcasters to
provide alternative solutions to ensure recep¬
tion and improve sound quality. For exam¬
ple, they now often transmit programmes by
satellite to local FM stations, which retransmit
them as part of their domestic schedule.
Rebroadcasting is fast replacing short wave in
some parts of the world, especially in Russia
and Eastern Europe.
In areas where co-operation agreements are
not yet possible, the same technology is used
to relay signals to short-wave transmitters in
the target region. The closer the transmitter, the
fewer "hops" necessary to reach an audience,
resulting in greater listening comfort.
Satellite direct
broadcasting
Short wave has been called the "first genera¬
tion of international radio". The second gen¬
eration, according to Simson Najovits, deputy
editor-in-chief of Radio France Internationale's
foreign language services, is the system of pro¬
gramme placement and leasing of domestic
FM transmitters. "What is strange," he says, "is
that the second generation is not likely to last
for many years. What's likely to overtake it
is the third generation called mobile radio."
Mobile radio, also known as Satellite Digital
Audio Broadcasting (Satellite DAB), means
digitally encoded signals, similar to the digi¬
tal sound on a compact disc, sent directly fro m
satellites to radio receivers in homes, cars, or on
the street. This, in the opinion of Najovits,
will relaunch the idea of international radio.
"It will suddenly make international radio
from several countries available everywhere in
the world with a simple mobile receiver," he
says, "which if mass-produced would be sold
for perhaps $1.00. A whole new horizon will be
opened, both in information and entertain¬
ment. It will mean almost a new medium."
The technology exists already, and prototype
receivers have been built.
The proliferation of Satellite DAB is
dependent on a typical chicken-egg scenario:
receivers will only be manufactured if there
are broadcasts to receive, and broadcasters will
only use the technology if the potential audi¬
ence has receivers. Market studies indicate that
most radio listeners are unlikely to spend $100
on a new radio just to receive international
broadcasters. The market will be driven by the
conversion to DAB by domestic broadcasters,
initially in developed countries where the

are more available. The dilemma for the large
international broadcasters is that the majority
of their audience is in the developing world.
The North-South gulf
"We're finding that there's an increasing split,"
says Jonathan Marks, Director of Programmes
at Radio Netherlands and organizer of a recent
conference on the future of international
broadcasting. "In some parts of the world
technology is leaping along very quickly, but
if you look at the statistics, there's an enor¬
mous gulf between North and South." There
is a large existing base of short-wave receivers
particularly in Africa and in the former Soviet
republics, where short wave has also been used
for domestic broadcasts across large stretches
of territory.
"A lot of people in Third World countries
depend on short wave," explains Victor
Goonetillike, a teacher and writer who mon¬
itors international broadcasts from his home
in Sri Lanka. "They listen to it for informa¬
tion, not for stereo music quality." He empha¬
sizes that $100 can represent an entire month's
income for a family in a poor country: "The
technology will be able to reach the audience,

but whether the audience can reach out for it
is another matter."
"People are still listening to short wave,"
confirms Andres Sennitt, editor of the World
Radio and Television Handbook. "The broad¬
casters on the other hand have limited budgets.
They want to invest in new technologies
because that's obviously what's going to be
important in the future. And in order to do
that they're having to cut back on some of
their short-wave broadcasts. So they're hav¬
ing to make difficult choices whether to
invest for the future and risk losing some lis¬
teners in the short term that they might regain
later on, or whether to stay longer with short
wave, and risk being squeezed out of the dig¬
ital medium. There are only going to be so
many satellites and if the big broadcasters have
already taken up the space, there won't be any¬
thing left for the ones that come along later.
"The real irony," as Dr. Kim Andrew Elliott,
producer and presenter of "Communications
World" on the Voice of America, and the
VOA's former director of research, points
out, "is that we already have DAB TV as a
reality, but DAB radio is a distant dream."
One possible compromise which would
permit the continued use of short-wave trans¬
mission for the short to medium term, and at

the same time improve the quality of recep¬
tion, is to relocate short-wave transmitters
which currently deliver their energy (via the
"hops" described above) to distant places, but
not to neighbouring countries. For small to
medium external services such as Radio Prague
International, the most effective way to oper¬
ate is regionally, targeting neighbours with
similar interests and cultures to their own.
Relocating transmitters
The current short-wave system was set up at
a time when international co-operation was
difficult or impossible to achieve in this area,
and stations. had to use powerful transmit¬
ters in their home countries, not necessarily the
best locations for reaching their target audi¬
ences abroad.
Now that there is a greater spirit of co¬
operation among international broadcasters,
says Oldrich Cip, co-ordinator of frequen¬
cies and adviser to the management of Radio
Prague International, "We should start co¬
operative projects which would relieve the
enormous pressure on the space of the short¬
wave spectrum. We could introduce integrated
projects such as streams of multinational
broadcasts on special channels. They would
be broadcast from strategically located posi¬
tions on the outskirts of Europe, let's say
from Russia towards western Europe or fro m
the Iberian peninsula towards eastern Europe.
This would deliver 100 per cent reliable sig¬
nals into these target areas. The homeland-
based transmitters could be switched off and
the spectrum would be cleared and improved."
In western Europe, Cip says, "you would
hear a stream of programmes, perhaps includ¬
ing Radio Prague and other stations from
Central Europe at very good strength, whereas
if you listened to those programmes from the
transmitters within central Europe you would
probably hear very little or nothing, especially
during the winter evenings because of physi¬
cal conditions."
If the lure of new technologies is irresistible
for international broadcasters, short wave still
has a powerful hold on listeners, even in rich
countries. Oldrich Cip believes that short
waves are here to stay for at least two more
decades, and probably for much longer. "Short
wave as a natural resource will always remain
within the spectrum of radio frequencies. Even
if we change to digital, we still have some space
which has to be utilized somehow. I am con¬
vinced that the condition of short waves can
be reversed so that they can be very effective
and relatively reliable. Of course, some of the
vagaries of the ionosphere never change. But
this is also one of the fascinations of short¬
wave reception."

BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE
Self-reliant low-cost community radio stations at
the heart of rural development
BY CARLOS A. ARNALDO
M young member of a street
theatre group in Sri Lanka
invites villagers to come to a
show that will be broadcast
on radio.
T| he concept we developed was very
simple: a radio built by and for the
community that would be small and
effective, and capable of being main¬
tained, repaired, programmed, produced and
aired by the people themselves.
There would be no large freight cases, no
need for heavy trucks to meet the shipments
at the pier or the airport, no tall shiny metal¬
lic cabinets to hold electronic gear. The whole
station would fit in a suitcase. So successfully
were these specifications met that our consul¬
tancy visits to prospective community radio
stations often began with, "Yes, welcome, but
uh, where is it?"
The beginnings
Historically this kind of community radio
arose from a combination of two factors: lim¬
iting transmitter power so as to keep costs
down, and using radio constructively to get
members of a community to work with each
other for social and economic improvement.
Technically the concept became feasible in
the late 1970s, when silicon chips were taking
over the tasks (amplifying, fine tuning sig¬
nals, selecting frequencies, controlling low-
power electric currents) of vacuum tubes in
transmitter design. This meant that the basic
transmitter (the exciter) could be the size of a
small book instead of a bookcase; it could be
assembled in a few hours instead of a few days
or weeks; it would not heat excessively and
therefore did not need large and noisy cooling
fans; it would cost less to ship, to maintain,
to replace and to handle. '
An FM (frequency modulation) trans¬
mitter of this size, designed for UNESCO by
Martin Allard, produced only 10 to 15 watts.
But with a 1 0-metre mast and a simple antenna,
and with no interference from other FM sta¬
tions in the immediate area (which is the case
in many developing countries), this trans¬
mitter could cover an area up to 15 kilome¬
tres in radius. Given the dispersion of rural
populations in many countries, this would

mean from about 20,000 to a maximum of
100,000 people.
The prototype:
Homa Bay
Homa Bay Community Radio, which was
installed on the shores of Lake Victoria in
Kenya in 1982, was UNESCO's first attempt to
set up a station based on this newly designed
low-cost, low-powered equipment. Engineers
assembled a small transmitter and a six-channel
mixer designed by the former Director of Tech¬
nical Operations of the Ghana Broadcasting
Corporation. Microphones, tape recorders and
other components in the semi-professional
range could be purchased at reasonable prices.
Later, engineers also designed an FM receiver
and an amplitude modulation/short-wave
(AM/SW) receiver adapter, both presented in
kits for local assembly.
Homa Bay Radio primed the enthusiasm
of the local folk for their "own radio", and
sparked their interest in local affairs. But the
station was short-lived. After two years, it
was dismantled. Independent FM community
radio in 1984 was a little ahead of its time in
Kenya, but the experience was valuable to
many other countries. It showed that radio
could be made by the community and that it
did not have to cost millions. It cost only
$25,000 to finance Homa Bay.
Village
volunteers
In Sri Lanka, the opportunity for another
experiment arose when Guirandurokotte, a
newly established township in the heart of
the Mahaweli Development Area, was chosen
to be the site of a new development centre and
a community radio station. In 1979 when the
project was launched, Guirandurokotte was a
grassy field crossed by a feeder road lined with
a handful of shanties where saronged old men
sold tea and cakes to weary travellers. It was
located in an upstream area of Sri Lanka where
there were fertile valleys and vegetable gardens,
small temples set amidst majestic coconut trees
and rich green rice terraces. Downstream, where
the river dried up before it could reach the
plains, the land was hard-caked and dry. The
cattle were thin and mortality rates for infants
and farm animals were high. Dirt roads octo-
pussed into the interior, where there were more
dried mud and shrivelled crops.
The basic plan of the Mahaweli Develop¬
ment Authority was to build a network of
reservoirs upstream, store water, and then
release it regularly through newly constructed
canals to ensure all-year-round irrigation to
the downstream regions. When the valleys
were flooded, some one million settlers would
have to move downstream to the drylands
which would eventually be watered by the
new canals. One could imagine the anguish of
farming families at having to uproot their
homes, farm implements and religious shrines
and settle in some unknown dry region down¬
stream. Whole villages with their sacred tem¬
ples would soon be underwater.
Alongside the Mahaweli Plan, a joint
UNESCO-Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA) project aimed to create
and train a team of mobile radio producers
who would visit the villages both before mov¬
ing and after resettlement and would produce
programmes to smooth the transition to their
new homes.
The Guirandurokotte Community Radio,
Sri Lanka's first permanent FM Station, was a
key feature of this project. From this station,
built by its own technicians, the production
team related to the immediate community. The
technicians also designed and built their own
mobile audio mixing console for fieldwork,
and when the transmitter developed faults,
they altered the design themselves and kept
the station on the air. With the exception of a
few weeks during the critical stages of the civil
disturbances in Sri Lanka in 1988 and 1989,

the station has been on the air continuously
since 1986 and is still operating today.
The team recruited a number of volunteer
producers and assistant technicians from
among the villagers. One volunteer, a farmer's
daughter, opens the station every day with
the sign-on announcements; others assist in
announcing duties and production tasks. The
station has also sponsored a clinic where village
folk were taught the basics of health and
hygiene and spread this learning both by radio
and person-to-person campaigns. The station
regularly promotes income-earning activities,
such as breeding goldfish for sale in the town
market and recording music cassettes of local
songs and poems. Guirandurokotte has been
eminently a people's station.
New targets
Now after more than ten years of experience,
new targets have been set, using community sta¬
tions in Welikande, Batticoloa, Trincomalee and
further north, possibly as far as Jaffna, to sup¬
port the peace accords which are seen as a major
springboard to rural development nationwide.
The basic philosophy behind this work has
been to encourage communities to undertake
their own communication tasks and run their
local media facilities to further development,
catalyse their evolving culture and bring about
a lasting peace. In many ways, radio brings
power to the people of these communities.

llenya's first community
radio station, operational
from 1982 to 1984, was set up
by Unesco at Homa Bay.
VILLAGES
I he 20-watt transmitter was hit
by lightning and broke down in
May," begins the Project Man¬
ager's report for 1994. "It has
been replaced. The local technicians were
advised to install a lightning arrester to fore¬
stall repetition of the accident."
The people of Banga, a small town in the
province of Aklan, in the Philippines, are quite
capable of taking preventive measures of this
kind. After all, it was they who set up their
small community radio station on the campus
of the Agricultural College and mounted its
antenna on top of a concrete structure on a
small hill nearby. The station, one of five sim¬
ilar set-ups in the less developed areas of the
Philippines, was established several years ago as
part of Tambuli, a community radio project in
which Unesco, the Danish International
Development Agency (DANIDA) and the
Philippines are collaborating. (Tambuli is the
traditional way of calling villagers to an impor¬
tant meeting.)
In this kind of project, the initiative comes
from the communities. The local folk build
the radio station, and after group discussions,
they set the guidelines for the broadcasters.
They organize the radio team, drawing on all
sectors of the village. There is no lack of vol¬
unteers. At Banga, Lyn Villasis, a beautician
turned broadcaster, reads fairy tales to children
over Radio Manduyong, modulating her voice
to evoke the characters in each story. A health
programme is hosted by a midwife. On Radio
Tambuli in Laurel, a little town in Batangas
province, Nerrie Bihis gives talks on develop¬
ment topics, town cleanliness and good man¬
ners, while a local police officer hosts a weekly
awareness programme on law and order.
Village problems

Two Christmases ago the Banga community
went carolling to raise funds for the purchase
of a karaoke sing-along system for their radio
station. In Baranggay Bugtong Bato, where
Radio Ibajay did the organizing, Vicente
Pagayonan played indigenous songs on a flute

made from a PVC plumbing pipe! Whatever
the music, people sing to cultivate a sense of
belonging and identify with their commu¬
nity in the context of a larger national culture.
In Banga, karaoke is more than just a sing-
along machine. Karaoke time is time for their
baranggayan sa himpapawid (village on the
air). Live interviews, and discussions with local
officials are broadcast between spontaneous
musical performances, problems are raised and
solutions are sought in what amount to village
meetings aired over the local radio station.
Olutunga is a small island near the south¬
ern tip of the Philippine archipelago, which
comprises some 7,000 islands. Toto Val
Samonte, manager of Olutanga Island Radio
(DXOI), wants it to become "the best island
in the world", an ambition that reflects the
confidence of his fellow townsfolk in the
power of radio to make Olutunga a better
place in which to live.
Community radio stations regularly hold
forums often linked to karaoke sessions on
gambling, irrigation, relief during floods and
typhoons, fishing rights and education. One
programme which revealed that cement used in
road construction had not complied with con¬
tract specifications alarmed the contractor and
persuaded the local authorities to investigate.
Local initiative
In Banga, local radio mobilized community
efforts to build a footbridge. Another station
successfully campaigned to clean up a big poul¬
try farm to reduce airpollution. Some families

and neighbourhood groups have started small
pig farms, fish traps and prawn production.
In Laurel, Batangas teenagers used the radio to
collect donations for the construction of their
basketball court. Often people tune in to com¬
munity radio to find out whether the local
bus has arrived! On islands like Batanes, which
only has three flights a week to the mainland,
it is very important to know the arrival and
departure times of local flights.
Community radio stations have made a
lot of difference to these "sleepy towns", usu¬
ally found at the bottom of the development
list. They have encouraged people to analyse
their problems and come up with their own
solutions, with contributions from the local
political and administrative authorities. Live
discussions on the air ensure a continuing dia¬
logue on issues of concern to the community
and perform a watchdog function by making
sure solutions stick. More civic organizations
are being formed, and new income-generating
activities are being started by families and
neighbourhood groups. There is a more con¬
structive dialogue with local officials.
"Were it not for Radio Tambuli, the Ban-
gans would still be sleeping," said one munic¬
ipal officer. "Tambuli has made the big people
listen to the voice of the small people." Added
Porfirio Bullo, Banga's station manager:
"Before we used to just listen to radio; now we
are the ones who are listened to."

For almost

T| hroughout its history Russia has felt
a need to link up its vast spaces, and
in the early years of the twentieth
century radio took over from the rail¬
ways as the instrument of this grand design.
At the third Pan-Russian Electrotechnical
Conference, in February 1 904, engineer Alek¬
sandr Popov gave the first demonstration of
radio transmission of the human voice. He
had already invented a lightning detector, and
in 1896 developed a radiotelegraph system
which transmitted Morse code. It was first
used by the Russian navy, which later owned
Russia's first large radio stations.
But Russian industry lagged behind
Popov's genius. Russia's first radio factory in
St. Petersburg was established by the Marconi

company, and the country's first radio com¬
pany was founded some time later, in 1910,
under the auspices of the naval authorities.
A propaganda tool
Lenin and his followers immediately grasped
the possibilities of this new medium of com¬
munication, and in their hands radio became a
powerful weapon in the exercise of political
power.
On the eve of the October 1917 coup d'état
the Bolsheviks issued orders to armed patrols
via radio. They asked the railwaymcn to stop
troop trains bringing battalions loyal to the
provisional government from reaching St.
Petersburg (renamed Petrograd). The rebel
sailors seized the naval radio station and the

next day Lenin wrote his "Address to the cit¬
izens of Russia" on the delegation of power to
the Armed Revolutionary Committee.
After the transfer of the Soviet government
to Moscow, the radio station at Khodinsk
became "the megaphone of the Russian revolu¬
tion". It broadcast government decrees, mes¬
sages for foreign states and peoples, and news
from the Russian telegraph agency. At a time
when millions of Russians, for the most part
illiterate, had to be reached and persuaded, radio
had the edge on the written word. It was, in
Lenin's words, "a daily that knew neither paper
nor distance".
Significantly, Lenin ordered the best Russ¬
ian engineers to be released from the jails of the
Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police, and sent to
work in the radio technology laboratory at
Nizhni-Novgorod. In 1920, the laboratory
produced a radiotelephone with a loudspeaker,
and some time later, a short-wave transmitter
whose signals could be received in Britain,
France and Iraq. By the end of the decade
Moscow was broadcasting to other countries,
first in German then in the other main Euro¬
pean languages.
At the same time, the content of Russian
programmes became more diversified and music
was given air time between speeches and propa¬
ganda programmes. In 1 924 private citizens were
authorized by decree to buy a receiver for per-
Ladio reaches distant parts

sonal use, and daily newspapers began publish¬
ing programme schedules. Scientific and sport¬
ing news, poems and stories went out over the
airwaves. Then came the first live broadcasts fro m
stadiums; the first radio correspondents and
children's programmes appeared.
A popular hit
According to Russian historian M. Miriukov,
radio was regarded by the people as a "real mir¬
acle". The Communist Party press was espe¬
cially interested in the audience's reactions and
its opinion of programmes.
In 1928 A. Chorin, an engineer who had
also been freed on Lenin's orders, patented a
recording and sound-reproduction machine
developed under his responsibility. His device
provided Russian radio journalism with a pro¬
totype of the tape-recorder. Later advances in
recording techniques in the 1 930s were decisive
for radio broadcasting during wartime.
In the mid-1930s two Moscow radio sta¬
tions broadcast images as well as sound twice
a week, thus paving the way for the coming of
television. In 1935, hermetically sealed as the
"iron curtain" then was, Moscow stations
broadcast a concert given in the United States,
while in response ninety American stations
broadcast a concert performed in Moscow.
On the eve of the Second World War there
were more than a million radio receivers and
nearly 5 million relays in the Soviet Union.
The broadcasting network covered nearly the
whole country.

ï with Hitler's Germany. Although German
troops advanced deep into the country, radio
stations continued to transmit, and the voice
of Moscow could be heard throughout occu¬
pied Europe, including Germany.
The triumph of radio
The leaders of the Third Reich, especially Josef
Goebbels, the Minister for Propaganda and
Information, wanted to silence the transmit¬
ter. The Soviet Radio Committee was among
the strategic targets of the Luftwaffe bombers,
and Radio Moscow's chief announcer, I. Lev-
itan, was on the hit-list of people to be exe¬
cuted if Moscow fell. Later Levitan talked
about his work during this grim period:
"Preparation was hard going. Your words had
to show no sign of panic or despair, and you
couldn't allow your voice to shake. The voice
of the radio was heard all over the country, at
the front and abroad. Resistance fighters and
partisans listened in. Radio brought hope,
helped people forget wounds and fatigue, and
called for victory over the enemy."
With the army, radio was the war's great
victor. With the coming of peace, its triumph
as the most successful medium of mass com¬
munication seemed incontestable. In the
immediate post-war years, Soviet radio began
broadcasting on three networks for several
hours a day. Some time later the appearance of
a receiver capable of receiving three programmes
set the seal on this success. Radio was listened
to everywhere. At the time it was so popular
and people were so convinced of its indis-
pensability that they could not imagine that
it would one day be supplanted by television,
then in its infancy.
This complacency, especially among people
working in radio, was probably partly to
blame for radio's decline in popularity once
television began to catch on. But radio did
not give up the ground it had won in the 1 920s
without a fight. When one of the networks
interrupted a concert to transmit the radio
signals from the first earth satellite, Sputnik,
as it drew closer to Moscow, tens of millions
of listeners were glued to their radio sets.
The thaw
Shows devoted to pure entertainment, apart
from opera and concerts, were unknown on
pre-war and wartime Soviet radio. It was dur¬
ing the years of political thaw under Nikita S.
Khrushchev that entertainment programmes
first appeared mornings and evenings. The peo¬
ple in charge of these programmes were famous
nationwide.
The defining radio event of the 1960s was
the creation of a round-the-clock station,
Mayak ("The Lighthouse"), which broadcast
only music and news. It currently reaches 221
million listeners throughout the Common¬
wealth of Independent States. Under Leonid
Brezhnev a number of directives were issued to
strengthen artistic, political and social news
programmes. New stations were created, and
the network grew and diversified.
Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power brought
changes to radio although the main contours of
the broadcasting scene remained essentially the
same. During his period of office the first steps
to dismantle the state broadcasting monopoly
were taken.

UNESCO Radio is different, unique
even, according to some listeners.
Unesco began to produce radio
programmes in the late 1940s. The aim
has always been to contribute to the
understanding of the ideals that the
Organization stands for, through dis¬
cussion of issues in the fields of edu¬
cation, science, culture and commu¬
nication.
Around fifteen 30-minute feature
programmes are produced each year in
English, French, Spanish or Russian.
Their subjects, chosen on the basis of
their interest both for UNESCO and the
general public, cover a vast field rang
ing from Aids to astronomy, from bio¬
diversity to bioethics, from street chil¬
dren to indigenous peoples, from the
violence of war to the culture of peace.
The programme catalogue contains
hundreds of recordings which are
offered on tape or cassette to over 400
national, public and community radios
in all parts of the world (257 stations
broadcasting in English, 60 in French,
60 in Spanish and 42 in Russian) as
well as to international short-wave
broadcasters.
For the last two years, UNESCO
Radio has been taking part in the
Nexus-International Broadcasting

Radio transmits sounds over long distances
using waves, invisible electric impulses that
travel through the atmosphere and space.
These waves, known as Hertzian waves
(from the name of the German physicist
Heinrich Hertz, who demonstrated their
use in 1 888) or radio waves (from the Latin
word radius = ray) travel at the speed of
light (300,000 km per second).
To make a radio connection, a trans¬
mitter and a receiver arc needed, each con¬
nected to an antenna. The waves travel
between the two antennae in some cases
by bouncing back from certain layers of
the atmosphere. Satellite transmission sys¬
tems exist today.
Sound vibrations arc changed into
electrical waves, which are then changed
into radio waves by the transmitter. The
radio waves are picked up by the receiving
antenna and changed back into an electri¬
cal signal which is amplified and further
processed before being changed back into
sound by the loudspeaker.
There are different kinds of waves.
Long waves cover almost 2,000 km.
Medium waves travel a few hundred km.
Short waves can travel all round the world.
Amplitude modulation (AM) is a
broadcasting method in which the sound
changes the power of the wave. Frequency
modulation (FM), which guarantees bet¬
ter quality reception, is a method in which
the sound changes the frequency of the
wave.
In simple terms, it may be said that
the transmitter codes the signals, the
waves carry them and the receiver decodes
them.

"The moro experience I gather, the more I realize that
Man himself is the cause of his happiness as well as his
misery," said Mahatma Gandhi. We should take inspi¬
ration from the words of this great Indian sage and
politician if we wish to estahlish a globally sustainable
energy system.
Such a system is an important facet of the changes
we must make in order to reduce current asymmetries
in the sharing of resources. These asymmetries, which
are morally unacceptable, generate frustration and
violence and threaten world peace and security at the
dawn of a new millennium.
It is estimated that 2.4 billion people today have no
regular access to electricity. The lack of a reliable means
of heating and lighting the homes , clinics and schools of
some 40 per cent of the world's population living
mainly in rural or remote areas of the developing world
acts as a significant brake on the development process.
In such areas, people more often than not women and
children are obliged to make long journeys to find
drinking water and fuelwood.
Renewable energy electrification would help meet
the basic needs of isolated populations in terms of heat,
light, the pumping and purification of freshwater, edu¬
cational opportunities, basic communications, medical
care, income-generating rural activities and improved
agricultural methods and techniques in short, all
those facilities we think of as necessary for a healthy,
developing community.

Leaders of the world's nations who met at the United education, training and public understanding in the
Nations Conference on Environment and Development field of renewable energy as a strategic priority,
in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 recognized the risk of
rapid climate change caused by gas emissions (some Tfog Solar Summit
of them with clear greenhouse impact) and prepared a
Convention designed to stabilize the earth's climate.
The Conference laid stress on the development of envi¬
ronmentally sound energy systems, particularly new
and renewable sources of energy, to the benefit of
industrialized and developing countries alike.
Industrialized countries can profit from the incor¬
poration of renewable energies into their national
energy programmes. Denmark, for example, today pro¬
duces 3.5 per cent of its electricity from wind, at a
cost that is competitive with traditional fossil fuels.

The World Solar Summit marked the start of a ten-
year plan of almost unprecedented international and
national action and co-operation. The World Solar Pro¬

H E RITAGE
efferson's dream house
by Francis Leary
Monti ce Lio, the mansion buUtin Virginia by Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United
States and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, is a jewel of American neo¬
classical architecture. In 1987 it was placed on Unesco's World Heritage List.
Thomas Jefferson
(1805) by the
American painter
Rembrandt Peale.
On the first day of 1772,
twenty-eight-year-old Tom
Jefferson brought his bride,
Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow
of twenty-three, to Montieello,
"Little Mountain" in Italian, their
new home. As a carriage could not
traverse the route in a snowstorm
at night, they had ridden on horse¬
back over the mountain.
Though only the one-room
South Pavilion was completed,
Tom was eager to welcome Martha
to the house he was building for
them. While outside the storm
raged, Tom build a fire in the
hearth and produced a bottle of
wine; a black servant prepared a
meal for the honeymoon couple.
The romantic aura of this firelit
snowbound first dinner at Monti-
cello reflects Thomas Jefferson
throughout his life.
A correspondent, to whom he
had written about his bride,
remarked that his description of
Martha was "the most Romantic
and Poetical that I ever did read."
A comment that might also apply to
Jefferson's feelings about Monti-
cello. This tall lanky youth with red
hair, freckles and grey eyes was a
complete man in the Romantic tra¬
dition. He towered over other men
in height as he would tower over
them in intellect and inspiration.
Most planters built their homes
on their plantations, on the low-lying
Tidewater land where tobacco was
the chief cash crop. Jefferson chose
a mountain-top in the Blue Ridge,
two leagues or six miles (10 km.)
from the town of Charlottesville.
His classical studies at the College
of William and Mary had revealed to
him a new architecture for the
house he was already planning
before his marriage.
In a 4-volume edition of the
Renaissance architect, Andreas
Palladio, Jefferson found what he
wanted. The designs of the Italian
master were inspired by the tem¬
ples and villas of Ancient Rome.
Palladio projected one-story
structures with double-columned
porticoes on each front and a hall
that extended the length of the

building, while living and dining
rooms opened off the central hall.
Local materials were employed
in the construction of Monticeilo.
Jefferson burnt bricks in a kiln in
the deer park on the southeast
side of the mountain, where the
deep-red clay was ideal for mak¬
ing bricks. He sawed the planks
for the flooring and had limestone
quarried for porticoes. lie relied
on cabinet-makers in Williams¬
burg for interior furnishings and
embellished the estate with
orchards and vegetable gardens.
Plantation slaves performed the
hard labour of construction as well
as working in the tobacco fields.
Jefferson had inherited 5,000
acres (2,900 hectares) from his
father, Peter Jefferson, and had
150 field hands to cultivate this
acreage. The extensive Ilemings
family acted as maids and house-
boys. They were never called
slaves, though in fact they were.
The first black slaves were
brought to Virginia in 1619.
Tobacco soon proved to be the
small colony's leading export, and
slave labour and tobacco farming
became intertwined. By 1790,
Virginia's population of 750,000
would be almost equally divided
between whites and blacks.
For Jefferson, the slave system
was "a iirebell in the night". Newly
elected to the Virginia legislature
at Williamsburg, he proposed a
bill to phase out slavery in the
colony, but he failed. The planters
felt that they could not manage
without slaves. Indeed, for Jeffer¬
son to try to build his dream house
without slave labour would have
been almost impossible.
'AFIREBELLINTHENIGHT'
During the War of Independence,
two English deserters, skilled
craftsmen, boarded at Monticeilo.
Billy and Davy made furnishings
for the house and built an elegant
phaeton to Jefferson's design.
Soon after independence was
achieved, Jefferson received a visit
from the Marquis de Chastcllux,
who had served with the French
army during the war. Most
impressed by his host, Chastel-
lux commented: "Mr. Jefferson is
the first American who has con¬
sulted the Fine Arts to know how
to shelter himself from the
weather."
The marquis also visited the
deer park on the southeast side
of the mountain. There he saw a
score of white-tailed deer, very
different from the European
chevreuil and so tame that Jef¬
ferson fed them Indian corn out
of his hand.
Jefferson's happy life at Mon¬
ticeilo was abruptly ended by
Martha's death. Torn apart by the
tragedy, he needed to get away
and accepted an appointment as
Minister to France in 1781. With
his elder daughter Martha and his
body-servant, James Ilemings, Jef¬
ferson came at last to the coun¬
try whose history and culture had
long fascinated him. On his return
to America, Jefferson's French
furnishings filled eighty-six crates
for shipment. Nothing like it had
ever been seen in the new nation.
Inspired by the classical archi¬
tecture of Paris, Jefferson decided
to remodel Monticeilo. He was cap¬
tivated by the Hôtel de Salm,
newly-built on Palladian lines, on
the rue de Lille, across the Seine
from the Tuileries. This princely
residence gave the effect of a soar¬
ing single storey under a shallow
dome, an impression produced by
rooms of oval and octagonal shajte,
great skylights and tall windows
extending from the top and open¬
ing at the ground level. It was a

design ideally suited to Virginia's
scorching summers.
Jefferson preferred the nat¬
ural beauty and wonder of Eng¬
lish gardens to the geometrical
perfection of the French. At
Painshill Park in Warwick, he
found the roundabaout walks,
mazes and serpentine walls that
he wanted for Monticeilo. He was
enchanted by the temple of Bac¬
chus at Painshill , built by Charles
Hamilton, a genius of eighteenth-
century landscape gardening, who
had created the park.
THETRANSFORMATIONOF
MONTICELLO
The entire east front and central
staircase of Monticeilo were torn
down to make way for a grande
entrée, a lofty portico of single
columns topped by Doric capitals,
which led into a great hall that was
connected by double doors with
the salon beyond. These automatic
glass doors were worked by a chain
in the floor wound around two
cylinders, so that when you opened
one door, the other also opened, a
contrivance of Jefferson, who
delighted in such tricks.
North and south wings were
lowered to conform to the height
of the lofty salon on which the
dome rested. On the east and west
fronts, the windows of the second
floor were elongations of the first-
floor windows, which opened at
ground level. Thus did Jefferson
preserve the illusion of a one-
storey mansion under an elegant
dome, as in the Hôtel de Salm.
In reality, the new Monticeilo
comprised four storeys. The base¬
ment was connected by a series of
tunnels to outlying "dependen¬
cies", a large kitchen with char¬
coal-burning ovens of 8 burners, a
wine cellar, ice house, dairy and
smoke house. These additions Jef¬
ferson had buried under terraces
on the hillside to preserve bis
panoramic vistas.
Jefferson's bed at
Monticeilo. Located
in an open alcove
between his bedroom
and his study, it
could be raised using
a pulley system
Jefferson invented. It
was on this bed that
Jefferson died on
4 July 1826.
To make Monticeilo completely
self-sufficient, Mulberry Row, an
avenue 300 metres long near the
house, was lined with seventeen
small structures of logs or stone.
Here were more slave quarters and
workshops for both white and
black artisans, joiners, weavers,
blacksmiths.
From Mulberry Row, a gate
through a ten-foot fence led into a
400-tree orchard and vegetable gar¬
den on the south slope, where Jef¬
ferson experimented with seventy
different kinds of vegetables. In
the large Fruitery, which included
the North Orchard of cider apples
and peaches for distilling brandy,
grew not only all the American vari¬
eties but such exotic delights as
figs, Spanish almonds and the
prized Breast of Venus peach.
A romantic grove of shade trees
and glades crowned the mountain
top. Twenty oval flower beds blos¬
somed around the house, while on
the West Lawn a Roundabout Walk
evoked an English garden, as at
Painshill Park.
All this beauty and practical
functions took seventeen years to
achieve. As Monticeilo was slowly
taking form, the master himself
was creating a new nation. As Pres¬
ident of the United States (1801-
1809), he grasped the opportunity
to purchase the vast Louisiana ter¬
ritory from the Emperor Napoleon
in 1803. The size of the infant
Republic was increased by 140
per cent and now stretched from
the Atlantic to the Pacific.
A 7,000-BOOK LIBRARY IN
'HONEYMOON COTTAGE'
When he was at home, Jefferson
often retreated to a sanctum sanc¬
torum in the south wing, the orig¬
inal "honeymoon cottage", where
he had his library of 7,000 books,
his study and bedroom, with alcove
bed. In the study, he kept his tele¬
scope, polygraph machine, revolv¬
ing table, reading stand and a
swivel chair with holes in the arms
for brass candlesticks all conve¬
niences invented by Jefferson.
In the north wing was the din¬
ing room, with an octagonal tea
room leading off it. The rooms
opposite were guest bedrooms,
each with its alcove bed. Addi¬
tional bedrooms on the second
floor were reached by steep nar¬
row staircases enclosed within the
north and south passages.
Another flight of ladder-like
stairs gave access to the dome
room, "a noble and beautiful apart -
ment with eight circular windows
and skylight". It was usually occu¬
pied by one of Martha's twelve chil¬
dren. The yellow walls contrasted
vividly with the floor, painted
"grass-green", as was the parquet
of the entrée, on the advice of
Gilbert Stuart, famed portrait
painter of Revolutionary heroes.
Jefferson died on 4 July 1826,
the same day as his friend and
political rival, John Adams. It was
exactly fifty years after the adop¬
tion of the Declaration that had
resounded around the world. Death
had come as he had desired, at
Monticeilo.

The Academical
Village
Jefferson devised a plan for what he
called an "Academical Village", a Uni¬
versity that would serve as a model
for the education of American youth.
He believed in a liberal non-sectar¬
ian formation and he devised a cur¬
riculum comprising all the intellec¬
tual currents of his time.
According to Jefferson's plan, the
university was to have eight schools,
including both classical and modern
languages, mathematics, natural his¬
tory, anatomy and medicine, moral
philosophy and law. A flexible elec¬
tive system, the first of its kind, pre¬
vailed; a student who had completed
six schools would graduate from the
university.
The "Academical Village", as it
was built in Charlottesville, was
grouped around a complex often pavil¬
ions, five on a side, before a grassy
quadrangle, the Lawn. Pavilions on
either side were connected by colon¬
naded walkways.
At the Lawn's north end, a majes¬
tic Rotunda dominated the scene, its
dome crowning three storeys, with
marble steps ascending to a columned
portico. To the south, the Lawn offered
students the lofty vistas of the Blue
Ridge Mountains.
His classical inspiration prevail¬
ing, Jefferson designed the pavilions
with no two alike, "to serve as speci¬
mens for the architectural lectures."
Each façade would exhibit details
derived from Antiquity. One Pavilion
would display Ionic columns with Doric
capitals, anotherthe Corinthian order
of Diocletian's Baths, the august
Rotunda would be a smaller scale copy
of the Roman Pantheon.
When the University opened in
1825, 109 rooms were available for the
40 students admitted. Soon, however,
a double occupancy became the rule.
Today, the original "Jefferson rooms"
are eagerly sought.
As the University outgrew the first
design, new buildings sprang up to
house the Faculties of Law and Medi¬
ane. The classrooms, student and fac¬
ulty quarters of the Pavilions were con¬
verted to other uses: public meetings
and social events. While the façades
were unchanged, rear extensions sup¬
plied amenities such as bathrooms,
toilets, modern kitchens.
The "Hotels" or dining halls now
harbourfaculty and student rooms and
the editorial offices of the Virginia
Quarterly Review. The Rotunda, once a
library, burned down in 1895. It was
restored to its pristine splendour in
1976 and is now an administrative cen¬
tre. The Dome Room is used for large
public gatherings and formal dinners.
The original concept of the Academical
Village is preserved. With a library of 4
million volumes, a faculty of 1,700 fine
scholars, this great University annually
gives diplomas to over 5,000 students.

bus mysterious words that often
appear in news reports are the
names of artificial satellites.
The satellite era began on 4
October 1957, when the Soviet
Union successfully launched Sput¬
nik ("fellow traveller" in Russian)
into orbit around the earth. An
observation tool weighing almost
84 kg, Sputnik circled the earth
for three months at altitudes rang¬
ing from 228 to 947 km.
Roistered by progress in infor¬
mation technology, satellite tech¬
nology has come a long way since
then. Today we rely heavily on
these eyes in the sky to tell us
about the environment and help us
to manage the earth's resources.
Eyes in the sky
Artificial satellites today observe
the atmosphere, the oceans, and
the earth's land surface from
space. They provide information
using two different techniques,
data collection and remote sens¬
ing. With the first technique, they
receive data from various points on
the earth's surface and then beam
it back to earth. With the second,
they use their instruments to
analyse information contained in
electromagnetic radiation emitted
by the earth.
The choice of orbit is extremely
important. A satellite in geosta¬
tionary orbit some 36,000 kilo¬
metres above the earth appears
immobile since it moves at the
same speed as the revolving globe.
Geostationary satellites continu¬
ously observe a wide area but are
hampered by their distance from
the earth. A satellite in polar orbit,
on the other hand, covers the
entire planet without remaining
permanently above a single region.
Geostationary satellites and
satellites in polar orbit do not have
the same uses, and their capaci¬
ties complement each other. Roth
kinds are used in meteorology, for
example, a field where satellites
have proven to be of vital impor¬
tance. Five geostationary satellites

enable weather watchers to keep a
constant eye on the earth's weather
system in toto, while polar orbital
satellites provide more precise
measurements at different points
on the earth's surface.
Satellites, whose weight ranges
from a few kg to several tons, are
launched by extremely powerful
rockets. The United States, Rus¬
sia, France, Japan, China, India
and Rrazil are among the countries
that possess such launchers, and in
some cases launch satellites for
other countries. Canada and the
Arab states, for example, have had
satellites launched by the United
States and France respectively.
Once in orbit, satellites record
images by means of still photogra¬
phy, TV cameras, scanners or
radar. Film from manned satellites
is returned to earth for process¬
ing. Unmanned satellites either
process the images themselves or
transmit them to terrestrial receiv¬
ing stations in different parts of
the world. Each image is ordered
in advance from the satellite by
computer and identified in detail.
This battery of observational
technology has great potential for
environmental monitoring. In July
1991, the European Space Agency
launched ERS-1 (an acronym for
European Remote-Sensing Satel¬
lite), Europe's first environmental
satellite, whose work was later car¬
ried on by its sister craft ERS-2.
The European
Remote Sensing
Satellite (ERS-1),
Europe's first
earth-observation
satellite.
Radar sensors enable the satellites
to "see" at night and through
cloud cover. One system generates
100-km x 100-km scenes of regions
over which the satellite flies and
measures wind speed and direc¬
tion and wave energy. Another mea¬
sures wave height to within 2 cm.
A third system is an infra-red
detector that measures sea sur¬
face temperature to an accuracy of
0.3°C.
High resolution images
"Our only way to obtain an overall
vision of the state of ocean biology
at any moment is satellite obser¬
vation of the ocean's colours,"
explains John Withrow, a member
of the Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission (IOC). "Data
on the colour of the ocean will
enable us to monitor such impor¬
tant fields as biogeochemical
cycles, the direct effects of biology
on the physics of oceans, coastal
resources and sustainable fishing."
It is only by observing colour that
we can also study carbon dioxide
absorption by the oceans, a phe¬
nomenon which has repercussions
on the abundance of marine algae.
Remote sensing is an efficient
tool for monitoring ice, especially
in the Raltic Sea. In the northern
reaches of the Raltic, the ice sea¬
son lasts on average more than six
months of the year and obstructs
shipping. Since 1989, ice-break
ers of the Finnish Shipping Office
have been equipped with a work¬
station for processing images sent
by the NOAA and ERS satellites.
If the image arrives quickly and
has a resolution of at least 100
metres, the captain of the ice¬
breaker can choose his optimum
route and transmit to other ships
information that will help them
through the ice without any need
for his ship to intervene.
In July 1991, fin; raged through
some 140,000 hectares on Spain's
east coast. Using their high-reso¬
lution imaging systems and trans¬
mitting four times a day, the Tiros
and Landsat polar orbiting satel¬
lites monitored the advance of the
fire, identified at-risk zones and
assessed the damage. Even at night
they were able to warn of new out¬
breaks of fire and smoke, enabling
the fire services to use their
resources to maximum effect.
A map-making tool
Satellites can also help us to take
stock of the natural environment.
They have, for example, been used
to map old growth forests in Ore¬
gon and Washington State in the
United States which have suffered
from over-logging. They identified
three levels the oldest trees (400
years old), 160-year-old trees, and
a lower level, and used three para¬
meters: rate of coverage, diameter,
and structure and nature of species.

The American yew (Taxus bre-

these forests. When taxol, an anti¬
cancer drug, was extracted from
its bark, large numbers of the trees
were felled. Later, a synthetic mol¬
ecule for the drug was created,
and logging was halted. If it had
continued, however, satellite map¬

the authorities and improve forest
management. Another unexpected
beneficiary of satellite mapping is
the northern spotted owl (Strix

work in Egypt with the most
advanced equipment.
Using maps made by this process
it has been possible to study 4 mil¬
lion hectares, to identify 6,240 plots
of land and obtain accurate statis¬
tics on Egypt's ten main crops. This
inventory of land use has also helped
to map urban development with a
view to preserving the agricultural
potential which is vitally important
to Egypt.
A non-stop
observation system
Will it be possible to increase and
improve the use of environmental
satellites? Manned flights bring
back plenty of experimental
results, and virtually the whole
planet reaps the benefits of
progress made in weather and com¬
munication satellites and is ready
to help fund them. But natural dis¬
asters continue to happen without
being predicted, and it is no longer
enough simply to note increasing
desert encroachment, soil erosion
and deforestation. Is the fate of the
earth too general and too long-term
a problem to motivate governments,
groups of nations and private com¬
panies to act?
André Lebeau, a former offi¬
cial with French and European
space programmes, believes that
if we are to fully understand the
global environment, we must devise
and implement a permanent sys¬
tem for observing the earth in
which satellite observations would
be supplemented by other
notably aerial observation at a
much lower cost. "The need for a
system of this kind," he notes, "is
not directly perceived either at
the individual or institutional level,
or even by nations. It only becomes
really obvious when we consider
the future of humanity as a
whole and since that is every¬
body's business, it tends to be
nobody's business." M

WHEN DOLPHINS AND MULLET END UP IN THE SAME BOAT
The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has asked the government
of Mauritania to ban harmful fishing practices in the coastal waters off
the Arguin Banks National Park, which has been listed under the
Hamsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance and
included on UNESCO's World Heritage list. Non-Maurilanian boats
fish illegally there, particularly for grey mullet spawn. The use of seine
nets and other huge industrial nets recently caused the death of 130
dolphins. WWF's request is also an alarm signal because these practices
are a threat to the fishing resources that account for 2/3 of Mauritania's
annual income. I
THAILAND'S PESTICIDE
PROBLEMS
Within less than 10 years, Thai¬
land has doubled its imports of
pesticides, reports The. Asian Wall
Street Journal Weekly. In 1994,
3,672 different products were
used officially. Many farmers
exceed prescribed quantities to
obtain higher yields with the
result that during the first seven
months of 1996 1,760 people were
hospitalized, and 16 died. H
GRIM CORNUCOPIA
Rhinos don't have much luck,
hut in this ease neither did a gang
of rhino horn smugglers. In Lon¬
don in September 1996 the
British police seized the largest
haul of illegal rhino horn on
record: 105 horns weighing in at
240 kg with a market value of
almost £3 million. Only some
7,000 white and 3,000 black
rhinos are still alive. Although
they are a protected species,
A DIVERSITY OF CREATURES
A new book about biological diversity in France published by the
French Ministry of the Environment is [lacked with information about
every aspect of the country's plant and animal wildlife.* It contains
case studies of the causes of species depletion and summaries of pro¬
grammes designed to protect a variety of species and habitats. The
book describes, among many other topics, what to do if you want to
help to clean up a river; the role of different government environ¬
mental protection agencies; and the extent to which such species as
the little owl (Athene noctua), the European sturgeon (Acipenser
sturio) and the wild tulip (Tulipa Liliaceae) are threatened.

they are increasingly threatened
because of Western interest in
Oriental medicines and con¬
sumption of "medicines" con¬
taining powdered rhino horn and
even bear bile! H
OFFSHORE
GENERATORS
The World Bank's Energy and
Industry Department has come
up with a smart idea to bring
electricity to developing coun¬
tries with a shoreline: barge-
mounted diesel generators. If
properly maintained, the genera¬
tors work well, and standard
engines can produce from 5 to 50
megawatts, depending on need.
Up to 100 megawatts can be
obtained by placing several gen¬
erators on a single barge. Among
the countries using the genera¬
tors are Guatemala, Jamaica,
the Dominican Republic and
the Philippines. In spite of draw¬
backs such as oil spills, waste
disposal problems, noise and
atmospheric emissions, the gen¬
erators have a number of attrac¬
tive features including mobility,
space-saving (particularly useful
when providing energy for small
islands), respect for sites on land
and, above all, the production of
low-cost electricity. I
UNPROTECTED PROTEIN
In Gabon, "bush meat" (game)
is one of the main local sources
of animal protein, and each
month 4 million tons of it are
sold on the markets of Libre
ville. Unfortunately, much of it
comes from protected species.
In 1995, a non-governmental
organization, "Vétérinaires sans
Frontières", came up with the
idea of raising cane rats (Thry-
otininis swinderianus) for their
meat to reduce pressure on these
threatened creatures. These
animals live on a diet of insects,
weeds and croji waste, and their
meat is rich in protein. Farmers
seem interested in raising this 4-
to 5-kilo rodent because initial
outlay is minimal and the addi¬
tional income is more than wel¬
come. I
GUINEA AND SENEGAL
IN PARK MANAGEMENT
PARTNERSHIP
Guinea's Badiar National Park
and Senegal's Niokolo-Koba
National Park are joining up to
form a single, cross-border park
and biosphere reserve. Eight
years after a draft agreement for
joint management of the two
parks was signed, 125 km of
trails have now been created and
an environmental protection train¬
ing and research centre has been
set up iii Dalaba (Senegal) helped
by funding from the European
Union. The Pan-African News
Agency (PANA) reports that the
centre is training 30 Senegalese
soldiers in environmental issues
and policing to combat poaching,
and will later host courses for
people from the 2 neighbouring
countries. The aim is to prevent
conflict arising from management
of their joint resources. H
