T HROUGH DOGON EY ES
◗ Text by Antonin Potovski
Long seen only through the lens of tourists, the Dogons have now started to photograph
themselves. Seven young villagers record their own people’s gentle daily lives
◗ Antonin Potovski has been working as a
photographer in Mali since 1996 and is preparing a
book entitled Les cahiers dogons (“The Dogon
Notebooks”). A forthcoming book prepared with
Bernard Faucon, La Plus Belle Route du Monde
(“The World’s Most Beautiful Road”), is soon to be
published by POL. The following photographs are
a selection from an exhibition taking place this fall
at the French record store Fnac.
■
In the Dogon villages at the foot of
the Bandiagara cliff, or perched on
the cliff-top overlooking the gr e at
plain that stretches to the Burkina Fa s o
b o r d e r , young people can always be found
busily writing letters to tourists who have
visited them.They fill small exercise books
with captioned drawings of the villages’
t o u rist trademarks: the masked dance, t h e
f u n e r a l s , the water bearers , the togouna
(the hut where villagers discuss their prob-
lems) and the separate storage caves for
men and wo m e n .
For three weeks in May 1999, a week in
September the same year and another one
in May 2000, I handed over my digi t a l
camera to two girls aged 13 and 15 and five
b oys between 15 and 29 so they could
extend their efforts at describing this wise
and gentle world to photogr a p hy.
Dogon teenagers rarely mess around.
From a ve ry early age, they are exposed to
the hard work crucial for surv i val in a
s e m i - a rid env i r o n m e n t . Since the villagers ’
well-being depends on them and their
i nvo l vement in a host of daily chores, t h e
classic problems encountered by urban
t e e n a g e rs are not felt here. If their pic-
tures seem mat u r e , poised and perfectly
framed—almost “ p r o f e s s i o n a l ” in appear-
ance—the reason lies in the thoughtfulness
and care they bring as much to the camera
as to their daily tasks.
The boys took the camera with them
on walks through the villages, or onto the
gr e at sand dune where in the evening they
practice wrestling for the festivities that
f o l l ow work in the fie l d s , at the end of the
r a i ny season.They also ventured up steep
p at h ways in the cliff, piercing through
openings in the rock, climbing up ladders
made of tree trunks notched with steps
and dangling over the void to reach the
storage caves and grottoes of the ancient
Tellem people (see box ) , where today the
Dogons bu ry their dead.These are sacred
places which strangers are not allowed to
v i s i t , but where Dogon children frolic hap-

A pair of thongs rarely survives the young Dogons‘ long walks through the villages or along the great sand dune.
being in charge of the camera for a whole
d ay.
These young villagers had no notion of
p h o t o gr a p hy aside from the touri s t s ’
l e g a cy : a few magazines cut out to decorat e
the earthen walls of their bedrooms, s o m e
t r avel books about tribal peoples in which
they feat u r e , and the sight of foreigners
aiming their lenses at the villages and its
i n h a b i t a n t s. An image they never saw,
unless the tourists in question posted a
few photos back to them as a memento of
their visit. G i ven that I was not around
when the pictures were taken, the only
advice I gave to the young photogr a p h e rs
was what I said as the photos were being
s o rted out. The ones we didn’t keep
because of a silly look on someone’s fa c e ,
a bad angle or the wrong light proved ve ry
useful in explaining how a better picture
could have been shot.
O ver the course of these miniat u r e
advice sessions, the seven photogr a p h e rs
s t a rted to pay more attention to angles,
framing and light, as in one picture
s h owing an assortment of items taken from
one photogr a p h e r ’s room and arr a n g e d
on a ye l l ow earthen step.The Dogons have
n e ver seen nor heard of still-life, so they
i nvented it to depict the colour of objects
i n s t e a d , they serve as a backdrop to much
more personal aspects of their live s.
T h e y take photos of their games, t h e
e n c o u n t e rs that pepper their daily live s ,t h e
long hours of enforced inactivity stretched
out on straw mats or on the scorching
rocks until the terri fic heat gi ves way to
n i g h t fa l l . Or their sorties to gather wild
f ru i t , brought down from the treetops by
t h r owing sticks, or hunting small animals
with home-made cat a p u l t s. E ve ry eve n i n g
I went through the photos, s u rr o u n d e d
by a dozen people peering into the
c a m e r a ’s tiny viewe r , and decided which
shots to keep and which to discard to make
room on our diskettes for the next day ’s
s h o t s. Out of 2,000 pictures taken, I kept
7 0 . The Dogons were more interested in
seeing the photos they had taken than in
the selection process. A b ove all, t h e y
e n j oyed wa n d e ring in search of ideas and
p i l y, p l aying with human skulls and bones,
and dressing up for fun in dance costumes
stored in the centuries-old cave rn s.
The girls did not venture as far afie l d .
They visited their female friends and we n t
for walks with them, taking photos of their
village and their school, where wader birds
and Dogon dancers are painted on the
classroom wa l l s.They also photogr a p h e d
a sandstorm that whipped up one eve n i n g
behind the high millet stems protecting
their storage caves before putting the
camera away moments later to protect it
from dust. M a ny of their photos were taken
in court ya r d s , which are much more the
domain of the village women than its men-
f o l k . Aside from the unhurried time spent
by the girls in the court ya r d s , taking shots
of their friends talking, teasing and
cracking jokes with one another, there is
little difference between the pictures taken
by male or female hands.
Until now, p h o t o graphic depictions of
Dogon life have concentrated on cultural
and social aspects, such as festivities,
building styles, crafts and religious activ-
i t i e s. But when the Dogons themselve s
take the pictures, they barely pay any at t e n-
tion to these feat u r e s.The special charac-
t e ristics of their culture are not the subject;
These young villagers 
had no notion 
of photography aside 
from the tourists’ legacy.

p a s s a g e ways where houses stand among

“ T HE ONES 
WE FOUND ”
Around 700,000 people live in Dogon country ,
a vast region 50,000 sq. km in size that
stretches from the Burkina Faso border in the east
to the area of Sévaré in the west. The land extends
over the entire length of the 150 km Bandiagara
cliff, which rises at times to 300 metres in height.
The Dogon people hail originally from the
Manding mountains on the border between Mali
and Equatorial Guinea. As animists, the Dogons
refused to convert to Islam and were forced into
exile in the 18th century, moving up the Niger
delta until they reached the protection of the
plateau and the Bandiagara cliff. There, they
made contact with a people who lived in the
cliff-face and bequeathed their cultural legacy
to the newcomers before disappearing in mys-
terious circumstances. They were the Te l l e m s ;
or, as the Dogons call them, “the ones we found.” 
N owadays, cultural tourism has developed
along the great cliff. Encouraged by the Malian
government, this new activity has helped impov-
erished villages take concerted action against the
spread of the desert and work to improve health
and education, while simultaneously imperilling
one of humanity’s most extraordinary cultures.

DEMOCRACY
IN THE LIGH T
OF DICTATORSHIP
◗ Alain Touraine
■
General Pinochet has frequently insisted that his actions can only be judged in
Chile since they were carried out on a national scale.The existence of “Operation
C o n d o r ,” h owe ve r , p r oves his claims are misguided. The dictat o rs of Chile,
U ru g u ay, Brazil , Pa r a g u ay and Bolivia—along with security forces in Argentina eve n
before that country ’s coup in 1976—embarked on a programme of co-operation aimed at
killing their opponents or making them disappear.They decided to make Asuncion the
headquarters of the programme, or rather their plans for eradication.Hence the interest
in papers from the period found in Paraguay.
The documents that can be consulted in Asuncion are mainly police archives cove ri n g
Paraguay alone. Besides, as is already known, the discovery of these files dates back to
October 1992, when they were made available for viewing (albeit with some difficulty)
through the Supreme Court.
It is quite possible to argue from a strictly technical point of view that UN E S C O s h o u l d
attach great importance to these archives. But the enormous interest stirred by these files
and their details of disappearances and murders has gi ven the “ a r c h i ves of terr o r ” a wider
symbolic importance.This was clearly shown by the press coverage in many countries
devoted to the joint mission organized by UNESCO and a group of French specialists.1
We are faced with a find that has aroused the deepest emotions.That is why we think
it vital that UN E S C O o f ficially show its interest in these files echoing the terrible events that
d e s t r oyed democracy in the southern cone of A m e ri c a . I am convinced that , in the eyes of
UNESCO, the symbolic importance of these archives as perceived by public opinion must
r ate as the chief consideration—and one that goes far beyond the simple contents of
the files.
There is good reason to believe that other archives exist in various Paraguayan min-
istries and above all in the records of the armed forces or their intelligence services. Doc-
uments are probably to be found in other countri e s.The presidents of the nations invo l ve d
should follow the example of Brazilian President F. H . C a r d o s o, who has opened his
country’s military archives for viewing.
On a wider front, the time has come throughout Latin A m e rica for memory to be
r e g a i n e d .M a ny people have held, in good faith or not, t h at the conflicts of the past had to
be forgotten so a new future could be built.As a result,the past was set up in opposition
to the future.This is a mistake.A country or an individual that fails to face up to the past
is unable, in general, to face up to the future. D e m o c r a cy cannot be built if the motives and
workings of dictatorships are not understood. ■
1. This mission visited Asuncion in May 2000 following a request from the Paraguayan authorities for
help in putting these files on the Memory of the World Register, one element of a programme aimed at
safeguarding and promoting the documentary heritage of humanity to ensure records are preserved and
available for consultation.

South A f rica recently announced that
it is ready to part with 1,500 ele-
phants which, it says, are destroying
trees that other species depend on for their
s u rv i val in the country ’s famous Kru g e r
N ational Pa r k . If there are no takers the
animals will be culled and their tusks
added to South A f ri c a ’s bu l ging ivo ry
stockpile.
The South A f rican offer highlights a
c ritical dilemma facing all those concern e d
with wildlife conservation:is it possible to
protect endangered species like elephants
and rhinoceros effectively if trade in wildlife
p r o d u c t s , e ven on a one-off basis, i s
a l l owed? South A f rica is one of many
African countries which argue that a lim-
ited trade in wildlife product stockpiles
should be allowed so that the proceeds can
be used to pay for conservat i o n . G ove rn-
ments and conservation groups that are
hostile to this approach claim that any kind
of sale will stimulate the illegal market,
encourage more poaching and ultimat e l y
push species such as elephants and rhino
closer to extinction.
The debate on this controversial issue
reaches a crescendo eve ry two or three
ye a rs at the Conference of the Pa rties to
the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES). The con-
vention has 151 member states which vote
at the conference on proposals to limit or
place an outright ban on intern ational trade
in species considered to be at risk (see box ,
p. 1 4 ) . At the CITES conference held in
Nairobi, Kenya, in April this year, calls to
lift the ban on trade in products such as
i vo ry, t u rtle shells and whales provo k e d
fierce debate.
While countries like Kenya and India
opposed lifting the ban on the ivo ry trade,
Japan and Norway wanted the ban on whaling
lifted because, they said, the stocks of some
whales on the endangered list are healthy
enough to withstand commercial harve s t i n g .
After long deliberat i o n s , the CITES part i e s
a greed to maintain the existing trade ban on
i vo ry products, t u rtle shells and whale meat
for the next three ye a rs.
Conservationists no longer oppose the
idea of wildlife being exploited per se. I f
properly managed, they say, wildlife can
provide food for impoverished rural popu-
lations and wildlife-based tourism can be
an important source of income.
H owe ve r , the sustainable use of wildlife
means striking a delicate balance.“ We only
s u p p o rt using wildlife where it is benefic i a l
to both the local community and to the
ecosystem,” says Gordon Sheppard of the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
“It is oversimplistic to ban trade,” says
Jon Hutton, director of A f rica Resources
Trust (ART ) , an NGO invo l ved in com-
munity conservation schemes in southern
A f ri c a . “ We need to assess the trade-offs
and come to a rational decision. We have
to weigh up the profits from trade that can
be reinvested in wildlife conservat i o n ,
through funding government law enforce-
ment or indirectly through providing an
income for local communities, against the
possible costs, such as an increased risk of
poaching.
“In much of A f ri c a , wildlife represents a
net cost. It can kill people and damage crops
and is therefore eradicat e d ,either deliberat e l y
or gradually by exclusion. More and more
land is being conve rted to agri c u l t u r e ,e ven if
it is marginal for live s t o c k , because rural peo-
ple often have no altern at i ve .A RT  is invo l ve d
in schemes which return wildlife ow n e rship to
fa rm e rs. They then have a choice betwe e n
c attle and crops or wildlife, and in many
c a s e s , they choose the second.Wildlife can
be sold three times: to touri s t s , to sport
h u n t e rs , and finally as ivo ry and hides. T h e
sale of wildlife products often brings in the
most reve n u e .The sale of ivo ry and hides for
example represents 80 per cent of the value of
an elephant.To u rism can bring in reve n u e ,
but most of the profits are made by intern a-
tional tour operat o rs and not by local com-
m u n i t i e s. S p o rt hunting on the other hand
can bring in enormous revenue for the local
community and it can be carried out in areas
t h at may not be suited to touri s m .”
While the “ n o n - c o n s u m p t i ve use” o f
species for tourism is accepted by most
wildlife organizat i o n s ,some are against  “ c o n-
s u m p t i ve use”—the killing of animals for
food or profit . Animal we l fare organizat i o n s
b e l i e ve that it is almost impossible to exploit
animals without severely affecting their pop-
u l at i o n s.“In pri n c i p l e , it is a nice idea,” s ay s
Sarah Tyack of the Intern ational Fund for
Animal We l fare (IFAW ) , “ but there are too
m a ny examples of where it has fa i l e d .”
Rhino revenue
In practice, e x p e rts say managing sus-
tainable use of a species can be ve ry diffic u l t
because wildlife needs and animal behav-
iour pat t e rns have to be carefully balanced
with human needs.Some species such as the
h awksbill turtle (see page 16), can easily be
ove r e x p l o i t e d ,and uncontrolled tourism can
s e verely affect some species. In Kenya ’s
famed Masai Mara reserve , for example, s c i-
entists found that the hunting success of
lions was reduced by a heavy inflow of
t o u ri s t s. Large groups of tourist vans tend
to gather around the cats and frighten off
their prey. “The key to using wildlife sus-
tainably is good management but in many
c o u n t ries the resources or expertise are sim-
ply not ava i l a b l e ,” s ays Sheppard.
South A f rica provides a good example of
the sustainable use of an endangered species.

The A f rican white rhinoceros is one of the
most endangered animals on earth but South
A f ri c a , as home to 80 per cent of the esti-
m ated 8,500 animals remaining in the wild,
has plenty. Well protected from poaching,
South A f ri c a ’s rhino population is gr ow i n g .
“ N u m b e rs could double in a decade,” s ay s
the World Conservation Union’s (IUCN)
Rhino Specialist Group,“ but only if there is
s u f ficient new land for surplus animals.”
The South African government argues
that if it were allowed to export rhino
h o rn , c u rrently banned under the
C I T E S , the revenue generated wo u l d
help to pay for rhino conservation.What
is more,profits from rhino horn would act
as an incentive for private landholders
and communities to maintain wild areas
for rhino conservation.
South A f rica charges a trophy fee for
rhino hunting, which generated $24 mil-
lion between 1968 and 1996, when the
c o u n t ry ’s white rhino population quadru-
p l e d . R e venue from hunting finances the
high cost of protecting rhinos from
p o a c h e rs , which can be as much as $1,000
per km2 per ye a r.
The interest in rhino has also helped
fund national parks.When protected from
p o a c h i n g, rhino populations can increase to
a level where they are too numerous to sur-
vive in limited park areas.To keep popula-
tions within ecological limits, l i ve rhino are
sold to pri vate rhino sanctuari e s. I n
KwaZulu-Natal, sales of live rhino, which
can fetch up to $30,000 per head, g e n e r at e d
a turn over of $1.57 million in 1998,and last
ye a r ’s rhino sales provided about 10 per
cent of the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Con-
s e rvation Serv i c e ’s operating bu d g e t . “ I n
a time of declining gove rnment spending on
c o n s e rvat i o n ,” s ays Martin Brooks, h e a d
of Scientific Services with Kwa Z u l u - N at a l
N ature Conservation Serv i c e , “wildlife sales
h ave been a vital source of revenue for con-
servation.”
H owe ve r , other A f rican stat e s , w h i c h
do not have sufficient funds or staff to tackle
p o a c h i n g, argue that any legal trade in rhino
horn will stimulate the illegal market and
lead to heavy poaching.
For example, people living in Damara-
land in nort h west Namibia are against lifting
the ban on trade in rhinos.When the regi o n ’s
rhino population was dwindling in the early
1990s due to illegal poaching, the Save the
Rhino Tru s t , a UN-sponsored gr o u p, s t a rt e d
a project which encouraged local popula-
tions to benefit from rhino through eco-
t o u ri s m .The project has been successful in
g e n e r ating revenue for the local community,
and former poachers have even been
r e c ruited as rhino trackers for touri s t s.
“ We worked with the communities and
they saw that the rhino were wo rth more to
them alive than dead,” says Simon Pope,
who worked on the project. “The people
worked hard to save their rhino but were
very worried about international trade in
rhino horn being allowe d . They believe d
that it would encourage poachers to come
and take away their live l i h o o d .” U n p r o-
tected by park rangers , rhinos on com-
munal lands would be especially vulner-
able to increased poaching.
Ja p a n , which strongly opposed boosting
trade restrictions at the recent CITES con-
f e r e n c e , argued that complete protection of
endangered species would be detri m e n t a l
to national economies and communities
dependent on wild species for their live l i-
Hides and other wildlife products on sale at a market in Laos.

h o o d s. D u ring the conference, Japan and
N o r way aggr e s s i vely lobbied for removal of
the Minke and Grey whales from the
endangered species list.
It is estimated that there are more than
a million Minke whales. Japan and Norway
argue that the population is healthy enough
to allow a sustainable harve s t . H owe ve r ,
many conservationists insist that the other
great whale species have not yet recovered
from centuries of commercial slaughter and
that a limited trade in Minke whale meat
could not be regulated well enough to pre-
vent the illegal hunting and sale of meat
from these protected species.
Changing
consumer habits
W h at hard evidence exists to show that
limited trade in wildlife products might
s t i m u l ate consumer demand and lead to
increased poaching? In 1997, the CITES
conference sanctioned the one-off sale of
ivory stockpiles from Africa to Japan as an
e x p e ri m e n t . About 60 tonnes of ivo ry we r e
s o l d .Two ye a rs later A f rican gove rn m e n t s ,
including Kenya, and a number of inter-
n ational conservation organizations quoting
independent studies, argued that poaching
and the movement of illegal ivo ry stocks had
increased as a result of this one-off sale.
There are neve rtheless questions about
whether trends in poaching and the illegal
market can be inferred from studies which,
due to paucity of funds, are often weak in
their methodology and focus on limited
a r e a s. “Independent studies from non-gov-
e rnmental organizations can be unreliable,”
s ays Sabri Zain of T R A F F I C , an intern a-
tional organization set up by the IUCN and
WWF to monitor intern ational trade in
w i l d l i f e .To help to fill this gap, the European
Union has promised to donate four million
Euros ($4 million) to monitor elephant
poaching and the illegal trade in ivo ry.
Another key problem is that of enforc-
ing intern ational trade bans and keeping
tabs on regulated sales. “Tiger poaching
for bones for traditional Chinese medicine,
as well as for skins, remains a gr ave threat ,”
s ays Peter Ja c k s o n , chair of the IUCN’s
C at Specialist Group. “ U n f o rt u n at e l y
e f f e c t i ve measures to control or reduce ille-
gal trade are seldom enforced in most
range countri e s , despite resolutions by the
CITES Conference of the Pa rt i e s.”
A d vo c ates of trade argue that tighter
controls simply incite smugglers to become
more sophisticated and drive illegal trade
further underground. Furthermore, some
wildlife deri vat i ves are almost impossible
to detect. R aw ivo ry might be difficult to
conceal but tiger bone can be pow d e r e d
and rolled into cigarettes or boiled dow n
into gelatine.
M e a n w h i l e ,c o n s e rvationists have been
a c t i ve in curtailing demand for some
wildlife products. Education programmes
in China have encouraged consumers to
reject tiger bone remedies and an interna-
tional campaign is currently underway to
highlight the plight of the Tibetan antelope,
which is in danger of being hunted to
extinction for its fine fur, used to make
highly sought after shahtoosh shawls.
C o n s e rvationists have also co-operat e d
with Chinese medicinal practitioners to fin d
a l t e rn at i ves to tiger bone and rhino horn ,
which are used in traditional medicines.
Mole rat bone is now being promoted in
China as an altern at i ve to tiger bone and
there is some evidence of a reduction in the
use of tiger-based medicines. Less than five
per cent of Asian consumers surve yed in
Hong Kong, Japan and the United Stat e s
said that they had actually used medicine
containing tiger part s.
Declining resources
for conservation
Trade bans should probably be gi ve n
more time to see if they can be made more
e f f e c t i ve through intern ational pressure on
g ove rnments and educating consumers. “ A
trade ban can only be as effective as the
n ational measures taken to stop illegal hunt-
ing and trade, and the efforts made to enlist
the invo l vement of gove rnments and con-
s u m e rs ,” s ays Steven Broad, director of
T R A F F I C .
But some argue that trade or no trade,
time is running out for wildlife. “ T h e
biggest single threat to wildlife is the
d e s t ruction of habitat ,” s ays Simon Riet-
bergen of IUCN.The figures are alarm i n g :
we have already removed or seri o u s l y
degraded 80 per cent of the planet’s forest
cover and 50 per cent of the world’s wet-
l a n d s. “Lack of resources and declining
g ove rnment budgets for conservation are
leaving many parks without adequate pro-
tection,” says Rietbergen. No matter how
effective a trade ban, it cannot slow down
the current rate of habitat loss or pay for
wildlife protection. Trade which has the
potential to save more wild areas and pay
for their protection may ultimately be the
preferred option. ■

K e nyan conservationists still shudder
at the thought of the 1980s, w h e n
hardly a day went by without park
r a n g e rs discove ring carcasses of elephants
felled with increasingly sophisticat e d
we a p o n s , their ivo ry tusks crudely hacked
o f f. S h o rt of funds and staff,K e nyan rangers
could neither adequately patrol their reserve s
nor match the poachers ’ fir e p owe r.
So it is hardly surprising that conser-
vationists and the Kenyan government
breathed a sigh of relief in 1989 when
parties to the Convention on Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) voted to
ban all international trade in ivory prod-
ucts. Had it not been for this decision,the
country’s elephant population would be
close to extinct today. From an estimated
140,000 elephants in 1972, the popula-
tion in Kenya ’s parks fell to a mere
19,000 in 1989.
Porous borders
The ban, along with world-wide cam-
paigns against trade in elephant products,
reduced the demand for ivory and, conse-
quently, its price. Poaching declined in
Kenya and in other countries with ele-
phant herds. At the same time, the Kenya
Wildlife Services (KWS) beefed up its
anti-poaching units in the country’s 26
national parks and 32 game reserves. As a
result, the elephant population gradually
increased and today Kenya has about
27,000 elephants.
This recovery nonetheless suffered a
setback in 1997, when CITES parties
voted to partially lift the ban on ivory
trade to enable Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Botswana to conduct a one-off sale of 60
tonnes from their stockpiles. The opera-
tion brought in three million dollars ,
which the countries concerned claimed to
have channelled into conservation efforts.
But conservationists affirm that even this
strictly controlled trading fuelled demand
for ivory and led to renewed elephant
poaching. According to Kenyan officials,
67 elephants were killed last year for
ivory, up from an average of about 15 in
the previous years—a figure they claim is
directly linked to the limited trade
a l l owed in 1997. ‘‘ Poaching continues
because there is still a demand and bor-
ders within Africa are porous, thus mak-
ing it easy for ivory to be transported
across the continent,’’ s ays Francis
Mukungu, a senior KWS official.
Kenya’s vehement opposition to any
lifting of the ivory trade ban during the
April 2000 CITES conference can be
understood in this light. Nor can tourism
be ove r l o o k e d : o f ficials are concern e d
that a return to the poaching levels of the
1980s will cut into the country’s number
one foreign exchange earner. Once again,
Botswana,Namibia and Zimbabwe, along
with South Africa, urged a lifting of the
ban to sell off legally accumulated ivory
s t o c k p i l e s. K e nya argued that such a
move would send out a message saying
there is no harm in buying ivory products,
thus encouraging poachers.
As a compromise, CITES signatories
agreed to continue with a total ban on
international trade in elephant ivory for
the next three years while allowing a lim-
ited trade in non-ivory elephant products
such as hides, live animals and leather
products.
Sharing tourist revenue
While the Kenyan gove rnment is
determined to save its elephants from
poachers,public opinion within the coun-
try is divided on the issue. Rural commu-
nities living close to game reserves com-
plain that elephant herds often invade
their farms and destroy crops, sometimes
causing casualties. In contrast to South
African reserves, elephants are not fenced
off and freely roam over hundreds of
acres. Rural populations also claim that
tourism revenues generated by entries to
the game reserves are never invested in
their poverty-ridden areas. In their minds,
efforts to save these animals at all costs
are a case of misplaced priorities in a
country where the majority live below the
poverty line. Conservationists assert that
in the long run, Kenya’s success in saving
its elephant population will lie in involv-
ing the local communities around the
r e s e rves in tourism and conservat i o n
efforts, and making sure that they benefit
economically from these initiatives. ■

CUBA DEFENDS

◗ Gerardo Tena
The protection of animal 
species is not necessarily 
incompatible with responsible 
commercial exploitation, 
says Cuba
■
E ve ry ye a r , thousands of haw k s b i l l
t u rtles (Eretmochelys imbri c at a) are
caught and killed despite the exis-
tence of the 1975 conve n t i o n ( C I T E S ,s e e
b ox p. 14) banning the sale of their shells,
which are the source of a hard, c o m p a c t ,
translucent substance much in demand for
making combs, j e we l l e ry and eye - g l a s s
f r a m e s. The trade ban has contri buted to
h u rting Caribbean fishing communities
t h at for centuries have lived off the turt l e s
and their protein-rich meat and eggs.
Cuba is no exception. B e t ween 1960 and
1 9 9 0 , some 150,000 hawksbills (about 5,000
a year) were caught along Cuba’s coastline,
which accounts for a third of the species’
nesting places in the Cari b b e a n .
Ten ye a rs ago, Cuba introduced fis h i n g
r e g u l ations that allowed co-operat i ves in only
t wo villages,one on the Isla de la Juventud (off
the south coast) and one in the eastern prov i n c e
of Camagüey, to catch a maximum of 500
h awksbills a year but banned hunting them
d u ring the mating season or catching speci-
mens with shells less than 66 centimetres
a c r o s s.The turtle meat is then distri buted to
a u t h o rised fishing co-operat i ves and to Cuban
h o s p i t a l s. C atching hawksbills is banned in
the rest of the country and punishable by a
fine of 5,000 pesos ($250) in a society where
people earn only about $10 a month. A l s o,
s ays José A l b e rto A l va r e z , an expert at the
Environmental Inspection Centre (CICA),
“if fishermen poachers are found with their
b o at , the boat is confiscat e d . This is the
harshest penalty under our fishing law.”
Cuba signed the CITES bu t , like Ja p a n ,
its main client, opted out of the clause deal-
ing with haw k s b i l l s. This allowed both
c o u n t ries to continue trade in the shells. I n
1993,however, Japan signed the hawksbill

Cojimar,near Havana.
CICA says the hawksbill turtle is not in
danger of extinction along Cuba’s coastline,
and that regulated hunting helps local fis h i n g
c o m m u n i t i e s.But the trade ban means Cuba’s
stock of shells is steadily gr ow i n g . At the
CITES conference held in Nairobi in A p ri l
2 0 0 0 , Cuba sought permission to sell its cur-
rent $5 million stockpile to Japan and then to
sell the shells of up to 500 hawksbills a ye a r.
The proposal narr owly failed to win the nec-
e s s a ry two-thirds majori t y.
A regional 
programme
C I C A ’s director Silvia A l varez says “ t h e
votes in favour were significant because they
were based on technical evidence,while those
against were based on emotion, because the
t u rt l e , like dolphins, whales and elephants,
are creatures people adore.
“A catch of 500 a year isn’t ve ry large
at all because surveys show that there are
about 15,000 nesting female haw k s b i l l
t u rtles in Cuban wat e rs ,” she say s. “ We ’r e
defending the principle of a regulat e d
trade in them, with the proceeds going to
the communities that catch them and to
p ay for more research into the species.”
She accepts that the rest of the wo r l d ’s
refusal to back the Cuban position ari s e s
from  fear that the sale of the shells in Ja p a n
would encourage a black market in them,
but adds that Cuba “takes quite the opposite
v i e w.There is a black market in the shells
precisely because selling them is totally for-
bidden.”
Cuban scientists say that in the area
b e t ween Puerto Rico and the V i r gin Islands—
c o u n t ries that contain only one per cent of
the total hawksbill habitat—about 2,000 tur-
tles are caught illegally eve ry ye a r.“ We should
h ave a regional programme for controlled
fis h i n g,” s ays Ms A l va r e z .
A Caribbean-wide group was set up in
1997 to look into the state of the species. I t s
m e m b e rs include Cuba, A n t i g u a - B a r bu d a ,
St Lucia,St Kitts-Nevis,St V i n c e n t ,Tri n i d a d
and Tobago and Suri n a m e . Ve n e z u e l a ,
Colombia and the Dominican Republic have
expressed interest in joining.
M e a n w h i l e ,Cuba continues with its pro-
gramme of catching an annual maximum of
500 turt l e s.“ We ’ ve got two more ye a rs until
the next CITES meeting to show that what
we ’re doing is a good thing,” s ays Ms A l va r e z ,
who thinks “the main obstacle is the notion

is not to use them.” ■

BRI TA IN: SEX EDUCAT ION
UNDER FIRE
◗ Jon Slater
The government’s blueprint to improve knowledge of sexual and reproductive health matters
and reduce teenage pregnancy has sparked a virulent debate
■
With 65 conceptions per thousand
women aged between 15 and 19 in
1 9 9 8 , England and Wales has the
highest teenage pregnancy rate in Western
Europe.1 This rate rose by four per cent in
the space of one year.
But while everyone agrees on the need
for action, there is a wide spectrum of opin-
ion on how to deal with the problem. A t
the heart of the debate is whether inform a-
tion or innocence is the best way of pro-
tecting Bri t a i n ’s children from the prob-
lems associated with teenage sex.
In the blue corner are the family values
c a m p a i g n e rs , led by churches, the Conser-
vative Party and the high-circulation Daily
M a i l n e w s p a p e r. While in the red corn e r
are those who believe that the only way to
tackle issues such as teenage pregnancy and
sexual health is to provide accurate non-
judgmental inform at i o n .The latter includes
most children’s chari t i e s , the liberal wing
of the Labour Pa rty and the department of
h e a l t h . “The more inform ation young peo-
ple have , the less likelihood there is that
teenage girls will become pregnant,” s ay s
Anna Coote, director of the King’s Fund, a
health think-tank. “It doesn’t look like what
we are doing at the moment is wo r k i n g,
particularly in secondary schools.”
Poverty and
social exclusion
Caught in the crossfire between these two
camps are Labour ministers wa ry of offend-
ing the right-wing press and keen to hold
together their “ o n e - n at i o n ” coalition which
swept them to power in 1997 after 18 ye a rs
in the wildern e s s.But much as it may like to,
the gove rnment cannot stay above the fray.
Cutting the number of teenage pregnancies
is vital if it is to meet its targets of reducing
child pove rty and social exclusion.
The gove rnment has pledged to halve
teenage pregnancy rates by 2010 and is
expecting to reduce by 2,000 the number of
girls who become pregnant this ye a r. I n
J u n e1 9 9 9 , the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU),
a gove rnment body which reports directly to
P rime Minister To ny Blair,produced a blue-
p rint for tackling Bri t a i n ’s alarmingly high
number of teenage pregnancies. Its conclu-
sions were stark. “ Too many teenagers are
being pressured into having sex rather than
really choosing to, are not using contracep-
t i o n , and are, as a result, ending up pregnant
or with a sexually transmitted infection.”
According to Jill Francis of the Nat i o n a l
C h i l d r e n ’s Bureau, “There are four main
reasons why girls in Britain become preg-
n a n t .We don’t gi ve children enough infor-
m at i o n ; we gi ve them mixed messages about
sex and relat i o n s h i p s ; social depri vat i o n
means girls are more likely to become preg-
n a n t ; and girls whose mothers were teenage
mums are more likely to do the same.”B o t h
teenage mothers and fat h e rs come pre-
dominantly from lower social classes.
According to the Children’s Bureau,
“teenage mothers are less academically able
than their childless contemporaries and
more likely to leave school at the earliest
o p p o rtunity with few or no qualific at i o n s.”
One national study suggests that a quar-
ter of teenage mothers were themselve s
b o rn to teenagers. The brutal fact is that
teenage parenthood helps to ensure that
those at the bottom of the social pile stay
t h e r e . Policies such as the New Deal for
Lone Parents (which gives young mothers
i n f o rm at i o n , training and other help to fin d
wo r k ) , i m p r oved parenting advice and
increased availability of childcare are all
designed to help young parents escape this
trap. But they are costly. Ministers would
prefer prevention to cure.
So far howe ve r , they are running into stiff
o p p o s i t i o n . One of the SEU’s central rec-
o m m e n d ations was to extend sex educat i o n
in pri m a ry schools. But it did not take long
for Education Secretary David Blunkett to
b a c k t r a c k ,s aying that he did not want chil-
dren under ten to have their “age of inno-
c e n c e ” taken away from them.While in pri n-
ciple pri m a ry school students learn about
h ow a baby is conceived and born , the SEU
r e p o rt observed that thousands of ten- and

Last November, the French government
announced that school nurses would be
authorised to hand out the morning-after pill to
teenagers “in situations of distress or extreme
u r g e n cy.” The morning-after pill, available in
France over-the-counter since June 1999, can be
taken up to 72 hours after sex has taken place to
prevent a pregnancy. There are an estimated
10,000 unwanted teenage pregnancies in Fra n c e
each year, of which over half end with an abor-
tion. Announcing the measure, deputy educa-
tion minister Ségolène Royal insisted that
teenagers given this emergency pill would then
be put in touch with a family planning centre for
advice on a “responsible form of contra c e p t i o n . ”
The measure, welcomed by unions of school
nurses, has unleashed a legal battle involving
Catholic and anti-abortion groups. Although sex
e d u cation has been part of school curricula since
1973, it has been given greater importance since
September 1999. Schools are expected to pro-
vide 30 to 40 hours of sex education  to students
in grades eight and nine. Meanwhile, the gov-
ernment launched a much-welcomed informa-
tion campaign on contraception in January 20 0 0 ,
with TV and radio spots and the distribution of
five million leaflets on contraception to high-
school students. It was the first contra c e p t i o n
campaign in 20 years, apart from an AID S
prevention campaign in 1992 that focused on
condom use. ■
1.The Office for National Statistics also reports
that 37.8 per cent of these conceptions led to an
abortion. For comparison’s sake, it should be
noted that the conception rate in North America
stands at 83.6 per 1,000 women aged between 15
and 19, and at 101.7 in the Russian Federation,
according to data from the Alan Guttmacher
Institute (www.agi-usa.org).

e l e ve n - year-olds receive no inform at i o n
about peri o d s , despite the fact that one in
ten girls starts menstru ating before fin i s h-
ing pri m a ry school.
Nor can secondary schools rest on their
l a u r e l s. “ We ’re not good at talking to yo u n g
people about sex.Lack of sex education is an
i m p o rtant contri bu t o ry factor in individu-
als getting pregnant,” s ays Francis.Sex edu-
c ation is compulsory in secondary school,
but parents have the right to withdraw their
children from lessons. The curri c u l u m
c h i e fly focuses on the reproductive system
and how the foetus develops in the uteru s ,
along with the physical and emotional
changes that take place during adolescence.
A nything beyond this is discretionary,
including contraception, safe sex and access
to local advice and treatment serv i c e s.
S e veral studies into unplanned teenage
pregnancies point to a lack of inform at i o n
about contraceptive use and embarr a s s m e n t
about discussing contraception with a part-
n e r. In Fe b ru a ry 2000, the Unive rsity of
B righton conducted a survey of nearly 700
pupils between 14 and 15 that revealed a
d e e p - s e ated anger about sex education in
their schools. Girls felt that classes focused
on the mechanics of sex and contraception
r ather than on emotions. B oys claimed they
were denied access to inform ation judged
too explicit. The majority were “ f u ri o u s ”
because they felt legi s l at i o n , such as that
which requires teachers to inform pupils’
parents if asked about contraception, h a s
stopped them from gaining access to infor-
m at i o n . Schools are expected to inform par-
ents when a pupil tells a teacher they are hav-
ing sex or asks about contraception in all bu t
the “most exceptional circumstances”.
The topic of sex education is all the
more sensitive at the moment as it has
been clubbed together with another row,
which has centred on the gove rn m e n t ’s
proposed repeal of Section 28 of the 1988
Local Gove rnment A c t , which bans the
promotion of homosexuality by local
a u t h o ri t i e s. Passed under the T h at c h e r
g ove rn m e n t , this clause is judged dis-
c ri m i n at o ry by the present Labour major-
i t y. Although not directly related to the
g ove rn m e n t ’s dri ve to reduce teenage
p r e g n a n c i e s , it has sparked heated debat e .
The House of Lords (the upper house of
parliament) has repeatedly rejected the
g ove rn m e n t ’s push to repeal the clause.
To break the deadlock, the gove rn m e n t ,i n
c o n s u l t ation with church leaders , h a s
come up with new guidelines on sex edu-
c ation in schools that would become
statutory—obliging all teachers to adopt
them—if they are passed. They wo u l d
notably oblige teachers to teach about the
i m p o rtance of marriage and stable rela-
tionships.
Morning-after trials
Many teachers in Britain feel that they
are already being asked to single-handedly
tackle society’s ills and are reluctant to
accept responsibility for reducing the rate of
teenage pregnancies as we l l .“ Teenage preg-
nancy is a major social issue which educa-
tion alone cannot solve ,” said a spokes-
woman for the A s s o c i ation of Te a c h e rs and
L e c t u r e rs. “This is a cross-depart m e n t a l
i s s u e , we need more joined-up thinking.”
The ATL is concerned that the new statu-
t o ry guidelines would undermine teachers ’
ability to conduct sex education we l l . “ I f
there are legal constraints, t e a c h e rs will not
have the confidence to teach it well.”
Coote agrees that more is needed than
just improving sex education.“There are a
number of fa c t o rs at wo r k . People don’t
feel the services on offer are properly acces-
sible to them. Professionals often don’t
speak their language, either literally or
m e t a p h o ri c a l l y.” M e a n w h i l e , as debate ove r
the guidelines lingers on, the department of
health has approved trials in some parts of
the country making the morning-after pill
available from pharmacies—including to
s c h o o l girls as young as 14. D o c t o rs usually
p r e s c ribe this pill.The initiat i ve has sparked
a media backlash and it is by no means cer-
tain that it will be extended nat i o n - w i d e .
But the government holds firm to its line.
As the SEU report stat e s , “preaching is
rarely effective . Whether the gove rn m e n t
likes it or not, young people decide what
they’re going to do about sex and contra-
c e p t i o n . Keeping them in the dark or
preaching at them makes it less likely they’ll
make the right decision.” ■

How would you react if your boyfriend
refused to use a condom? How do your
friends feel about condoms? Write down
what you think they will answer and ask them
if you were right.
This open talk is how some teachers in the
Netherlands approach sexuality with stu-
dents between 12 and 15 ye a rs old. S u b-
sidised by the Dutch gove rn m e n t , the “L a n g
l e ve de liefde” (“Long Live Love”) package wa s
d e veloped in the late 1980s, when AI D S
became recognised as a threatening health
p r o b l e m . “A I D S was an impetus for sex edu-
c ation in schools,” s ays Jo Reinders of Soa-
b e s t ri j d i n g, the Dutch foundation for STD
(sexually transmitted diseases) control,w h i c h
d e veloped the package in consultation with
c h u r c h e s , health officials and family plan-
ning organizat i o n s. “It forced teachers to
become more explicit and to discuss norm s
and values using a part i c i p at o ry approach.”
Decision-making skills
With the lowest teenage pregnancy rat e
in Europe (8.4 per 1,000 girls between 15
and 19), any initiative in the Netherlands
d e s e rves at t e n t i o n . “There is no country
that has invested so much in research into
family planning…, media attention and
improvement of service delivery than the
N e t h e r l a n d s ,” wrote experts from the
Netherlands Institute of Social and Sexo-
logical Research (NISSO) in a specialised
j o u rn a l . Although the country has no
mandatory national curriculum, nearly all
s e c o n d a ry schools provide sex educat i o n
as part of biology classes and over half the
c o u n t ry ’s pri m a ry schools address sexu-
ality and contraception. According to H.
R o l i n g, a professor of education at the Uni-
versity of Amsterdam,“the Dutch govern-
ment has always accepted the fact that edu-
c ation was better than denial,” and the
subject has been tackled in schools since the
1970s.
Since 1993, the gove rn m e n t , w i t h o u t
s t i p u l ating the contents of classes, h a s
stressed that schools should aim to gi ve stu-
dents the skills to take their own decisions
regarding health, and in particular sexu-
a l i t y.Textbooks were revised and according
to Reinders ,n ow take a more “ c o m p r e h e n-
s i ve approach to sexuality.The curri c u l u m
focuses on biological aspects of reproduction
as well as on va l u e s , at t i t u d e s ,c o m m u n i c a-
tion and negotiation skills.” Some schools
simply use these textbooks, o t h e rs comple-
ment them with the foundat i o n ’s pack,
which includes a video, a teacher’s manual
and a student magazine. “The educat i o n
system is ve ry much built not only around
transmitting knowledge but giving the skills
to apply that knowledge in eve ry d ay life,”
s ays Reinders. “Decision-making skills are
ve ry import a n t .”
But sex education in schools is not enough
to explain the Dutch record. The Rutgers
Fo u n d at i o n , a family planning associat i o n
t h at has launched several large-scale public
i n f o rm ation campaigns in the past decades,
sees a constellation of other fa c t o rs.The media
has been at the forefront of an open dialogue:
b e t ween 1993 and 1997, a prime-time talk
s h ow featured a leading Dutch pop star
discussing sexuality. C o n-
f i d e n t i a l i t y, g u a r a n t e e d
a n o nymity and a non-judg-
mental approach are hall-
marks of the health care
s y s t e m . Last but not least,
“parents in the Netherlands
take a ve ry pragmat i c
a p p r o a c h . They know their
children are going to have
s e x , and they are ready to
prepare them and to speak
with them about their
r e s p o n s i b i l i t y.This is the key
wo r d ,” s ays Mischa Heeger
of the Rutgers Fo u n d at i o n .
C o n t r a c e p t i ves are widely
u s e d .According to a NISSO
s t u d y, 85 per cent of sexually
a c t i ve young people use a
c o n t r a c e p t i ve , and the pill is
freely ava i l a b l e .The ave r a g e
age of a yo u t h ’s first sexual
i n t e r c o u rse is 17.7 ye a rs.
Even with this record,
the Fo u n d ation for STD
control recognises that it is
still difficult for many teachers to talk with
students about sexuality, despite training
p r ovided over the ye a rs , notably by the Rut-
gers Foundation. Family planning organi-
z ations are also concerned about the higher
rates of teenage pregnancy among Turkish
and Moroccan gi r l s , and are deve l o p i n g
p r o grammes specially geared towards them.
But the country’s record has attracted
attention from abroad.The Rutgers Fo u n-
d ation provides training to doctors and
social workers as well as assistance to edu-
cation ministries in developing curricula,
notably in Central and Eastern Europe and
Central A s i a . To some critics who argue
that “talking about sex gives children the
wrong idea,” Jos Poelman of the Fo u n d at i o n
for STD control has one answe r.“ Face the
fa c t s.We have the lowest number of teenage
mothers [in Europe], and Dutch students
do not start having sex at a younger age than
their foreign counterparts.” ■

W O R L D  O F  L E A R N I N G
20 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 2000
Pregnancy related problems are a leading
cause of death among adolescents. Are most
of these unwanted pregnancies? 
You have to distinguish between preg-
nancies within and outside marri a g e . I n
c o u n t ries like Bangladesh, Nepal and some
p a rts of A f ri c a , the number of girls marri e d
by 15 or 16 is exceedingly high—up to 70 or,
80 per cent. In those situat i o n s , p r e g n a n cy
within marriage may be wanted but we know
t h at it is hazardous, in terms of its conse-
quences on health, e d u c ation and economic
o p p o rt u n i t y. Outside of marri a g e , the va s t
m a j o rity of pregnancies are unwa n t e d .T h e
“ s u g a r - d a d d y ” phenomenon is common,
while a more recent trend is the false belief
by some men that by sleeping with a virgi n ,
they will not get A I D S .
Does pregnancy generally mean an end to
education ?
Yes, or else girls often end up having
botched-up backstreet abortions because
they are afraid of being expelled.You could
argue that schools should be encouraged to
keep pregnant students but in reality, this
d o e s n ’t really wo r k . These women have
special needs. In countries as far afield as
Jamaica and Tanzania, we have set up spe-
cial  schools for pregnant mothers allow i n g
them to complete their educat i o n . O n c e
the child is born, they often continue into
vocational education as long as childcare
facilities exist.
What impact did the 1994 International
Conference on Population and Development
have? 
The United Nations Population Fund
took a leadership role by spearheading the
need to look at adolescents as a group whose
sexuality had to be recognised and whose
needs had to be met in terms of educat i o n ,
i n f o rm ation and serv i c e s. This has to be
done in a holistic way. The conference
made the world aware that this was not a
problem that you could just sweep under the
carpet. But at a country level, progress in
taking care of teenagers ’ needs has been
s l ow. NGOs are setting the example in most
c a s e s , notably with peer education projects
that are giving promising results.
To what extent has sex education improved,
particularly in developing countries? 
In some countries including my own (Sri
Lanka) sex education exists, but in reality
t e a c h e rs are not trained to handle these issues.
Sex education is not just about having sex, i t ’s
about relationships and making choices. G i r l s
need empowe rment to say “ n o ” to a rela-
tionship and this is difficult for them.T h i s
kind of sex education is still rare in schools
and often starts too lat e .P ri m a ry school is the
i m p o rtant starting point. But you also have to
look at what is happening outside the school,
because ve ry often girls drop out at the sec-
o n d a ry leve l , and there are some 125 million
children who never go to school at all.T h e
potential of distance learn i n g, media and
other communication forms has to be more
broadly harn e s s e d .
What do we know about the impact of sex
education programmes?
Study after study has pointed out that
sex education delays childbearing and does
not lead to promiscuity or to early sexual
experimention. It is usually the reverse: if
you are forearmed with that know l e d g e ,
you are more cautious. In eve ry walk of
l i f e , we train young people to cope, we gi ve
them skills and know l e d g e , but when it
comes to sex education, there seems to be
a myth that the less you tell them the better
off they are. It makes no sense. It is control
of power by an older generation.
How can access to contraception be improved,
notably in Africa?
There is a crying need for inform at i o n
on contraception.I n f o rm ation has to be made
available through a va riety of sources: i n
c l i n i c s , in pharm a c i e s , through peer gr o u p s ,
the media, e t c. S e rvices have to be made
more yo u t h - f riendly and accessible to all
young people regardless of their marital stat u s.
Young people themselves should play an active
role in defining how health services should be
ru n .The press can play a pivotal role: we are
running a particularly successful operat i o n
with the BBC World Service known as S e x w i s e.
It is a 12-part series on sex educat i o n , fa m i l y
life educat i o n , contraception and parenting.
In South A s i a , where it was first launched in
eight languages, we received some 75,000
q u e ries from listeners.After being extended in
1999 to Europe and Eurasia,the series will go
global in July 2000 and is expected to reach
over 60 million listeners in A f ri c a , the A r a b
wo r l d , L atin A m e ri c a , South East Asia and
China by the end of the ye a r.
In 1999, the U.S. introduced a rule that aims to
defund organizations outside the U.S. which
provide any abortion-related information and
assistance to women in need. Are you
concerned about this?
This rule is hurting wo m e n . It is
depriving funds for NGOs like ours. This
means we are unable to provide reproduc-
t i ve health serv i c e s , including contraception
and family planning to women who are in
need.This results in more unwanted preg-
nancies because services are not available
and women who could have gone to have
s e rvices ended up having botched-up abor-
tions. It is very shortsighted. ■

rom the nose-ringed neo-hippie in Belgium to the dread-

unites the disparate bands of youth:m u s i c .A style guide, s o c i a l
companion and spiritual force, music offers directions in the quest
for autonomy and a medium to express the highs and lows of the
j o u r n e y.
This dossier will trace two genres carving the deepest inroads
in the globalisation of popular music: hip-hop (p. 23-25) and elec-
tronic dance music (p. 2 8 - 3 0 ) . While there is no denying the com-
mercial muscle of recording giants in pushing these genres world-
wide (p. 2 6 - 2 7 ) , young people aren’t just swallowing these “ g o o d s ”
but fashioning sub-cultures in adapting the music as their own.Fr o m
a political platform for indigenous rights in New Zealand (p.3 2 - 3 3 )
to a foundry for moulding a sense of identity among black youth
in Colombia (p. 3 8 - 3 9 ) , hip-hop thrives on the transformative
powers of its bricoleurs. In South A f r i c a , the genre has been hard-
wired to amplify the messages of the post-apartheid generation
( p. 36-37) while Algerian rappers no longer see hip-hop as just a
wishing-well for a better economic life,but a stepping stone to polit-
ical debate.
H o w e v e r, these positive chords of independent think-
ing and multiculturalism ring hollow when the rebellious gestures
surrounding the music mask a capitulation to hyper- c o n s u m e r i s m
and the refusal or inability to fight racism (p. 3 1-3 2 ) . In the UK for

little more than an example of niche marketing (p.4 7 ) .Yet in India, t h e
same eclectic mixes of traditional music are leading the sons and
daughters of an anglicised elite to discover their roots via their expa-
triate relations.
Herein lies the key to deciphering globalised music and youth cul-
t u r e s : identify the particular politics shaping each local scene (p. 4 0 -
4 1 ) . The Australian bush, for example, seems to offer ideal condi-
tions for realising the “ f u t u r i s t ”dream of techno’s punk-like resistance
( p.4 2 - 4 3 ) , yet the impact of tourist dollars may spoil the scene. In Bel-
g r a d e, electronic music is a rallying call for isolated bands of youth
r e b e l s, holed up in the cracks and abandoned spaces of the regime (p.
4 3 - 4 4 ) .
The very sound of a revolution provokes reaction.And music is no
e x c e p t i o n , as parents and police panic over the now traditional
mantra of “ s e x ,drugs & rock ’n’ roll”. Instead of sounding the alarm,
we chose to defuse it by considering the alternatives.As thousands of
Western neo-hippies descend upon Goa for trance music parties,
parents and state focus exclusively on the spectre of cultural imperi-
alism without recognising ways in which their communities benefit from
the scene (p. 5 1 - 5 2 ) . By reading between the lines of media sensa-
tionalism and stereotyping, the violence associated with hip-hop can
be cast in a different light (p. 5 3 - 5 4 ) . Fi n a l l y, young Internet pirates,
branded as criminals by the recording industry,are in fact showing the
way to new forms of international solidarity (p. 5 5 - 5 6 ) . ■
Dossier concept and co-ordination by Amy Otchet, UNESCO Courier journalist
Youth culture may well degenerate into simply
another way for capitalists to sell back to people a
picture of the life that has been stolen from them.
Yet it would be foolish to dismiss youth culture
simply because it has not yet produced an
organised political movement.

Youth’s sonic forces
July/August 2000 -The UNESCO Courier 23
During the summer of 1975,the South Bronx
was burning. New York City officials admit-
ted that they couldn’t battle all the fires, let
alone investigate their origins. Chaos reigned.One
long hot day in June, 40 fires were set in a three-
hour period.
These were not the fires of purifying rage that
ignited Watts in 1965, N e wark in 1967, or St. L o u i s
and a half dozen other U.S. cities after the assassi-
nation of Martin Luther King, Jr. These were the
fires of abandonment.
As hip-hop journalist S.H. Fe rnando notes, t h e
Bronx had been a borough of promise for African
American, Puerto Rican, Irish, Italian and Jewish
families after World War II. But as industry moved
n o rth to the suburbs during the sixties,housing va l-
ues collapsed and whites fled,leaving a population
overwhelmingly poor and of colour.
So slumlords were employing young thugs to
s y s t e m atically bu rn the devalued buildings to chase
out the poor tenants and collect millions in insur-
ance.Hip-hop, it could be said, was born in fire.
As rapper Grandmaster Flash and the Furious
Five’s “The Message” would describe it, the New
York ghettoes that fuelled hip-hop’s re-creat i ve pro-
ject were spaces of state neglect and fading liberal
d r e a m s. “Got a bum educat i o n ,” the narr at o r
r hy m e d ,“ d o u b l e - d i git inflat i o n ,c a n ’t take a train to
work there’s a strike at the stat i o n .” But these wo u l d
also be spaces of spiritual and creative renewal.
In an earlier era, say the 1920s and 30s when
jazz legends like Charles Mingus grew up, a youth
might find an extended web of peers , m e n t o rs ,
p at r o n s , bands and venues through which he or she
might master an instrument and find a vo c at i o n .
But by the late 1970s,such music education was a
luxury for most families.
Jamaican connection
The result? Play, as A f rican A m e rican author
Robin D.G. Kelley has put it, became an alternate
f o rm of work for a new generat i o n . Adapting the
Jamaican tradition of outdoor dance parties to the
grid and grit of New York, young black and Puerto
Rican entrepreneurs illegally plugged their stereo
systems into street light power supplies, and start e d
the party.
With vinyl grooves as sheet music, and a rig of
two turntables,a mixer and an amplifier as instru-
ments, Black Art began reinventing itself in 1974

and 1975.That’s when a Jamaican immigrant disc
jockey named Kool Herc started gaining a reputa-
tion in the Bronx for filling the smoky air with “the
b r e a k s ” — t h at portion of the song, often as short
as two seconds,where the singer dropped out and
let the band immerse itself in the groove.
Punching back and forth between two copies
of the same record’s breaks,then ratcheting up the
excitement by shifting to ever more intense breaks,
DJs like Herc and Afrika Bambaataa were creating
a new aesthetic, which simultaneously sat i ated and
teased the audience.
Escaping the chaos 
on the streets
On the one hand, a loop (of beats) became a
metaphor for freedom: through move m e n t ,d a n c e rs
stretched within the space sculpted by the break.A
new canon of songs—drawn from funk, d i s c o, r o c k ,
jazz,Afrobeat and reggae—launched new, athletic
forms of dancing, which would become known as
breakdancing or b-boying.Rather than being pas-
sive spectators,the audience engaged in a real dia-
logue with the disc jockey.
The New York DJs began employing MCs—
m a s t e rs of ceremony—to affirm the crow d ’s response
to proven breaks, win them over to new breaks,d i ve rt
them during bad records and generally keep spiri t s
h i g h . In time, the MCs became attractions in their
own ri g h t . Rocking memorized poems (“wri t t e n s ” )
or improvising them on the spot (“freestyles”), t h e
MC became Eve ry m a n , the representat i ve of the
audience onstage. They reacted to the MC’s flow,
laughed at his cleve rn e s s , cheered his braggadocio,
t h rilled at his tall-tale spinning, felt his bluesy pain,
riding the riddims with words (or “ r a p p i n g ” ) .
The Black A rts poets, the Black Panther messiahs
and other revo l u t i o n a ry firebrands sharpened their
words into spears to at t a c k .This new generation of
r a p p e rs let the words flow generously, in search of a
moment that might serve as a shield of protection, o r
a transcendent escape from the chaos on the streets.
Popular culture in America is one space where
the trope (expression) of working-class creativity is
still firmly lodged. American markets are good at
p r oviding poor audiences of colour easy access to
goods such as music, video and clothing. In the last
three decades, a whole class of middlemen entre-
p r e n e u rs have made fortunes by charting the rapidly
shifting terrain of black and brown ghetto chic.

24 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 2000
By the late 70s, black and Jewish record label
owners in Harlem noted the popularity of hip-hop
and rushed to record leading crews. B a s i c a l l y, t h e s e
ow n e rs were geographically and personally close
to the music.When a novelty record by the Sugar
Hill Gang, “Rapper’s Delight” became a surprise
i n t e rn ational smash, major labels began sniffin g
around uptown for the next hit. In 1980, Ku rt i s
B l ow released rap’s first full-length album on a
major label.The stage was set for the ascendance of
hip-hop culture into the most powerful intern a-
tional youth culture of the late twentieth century.
Until the late 80s, the undisputed centre of this
culture was New Yo r k . The visual signifie rs we r e
provided by the vibrant graffiti movement, whose
young renegade artists braved electri fied razor-wire
fences and armed Metropolitan Transit Authority
guards to apply bright spraypaint hieroglyphics
onto the city’s subways. Every time a train pulled
into a station,hip-hop was in respectable society’s
face,like a middle-finger.
Remember the backdrop to the 1980s: the Rea-
gan administration was launching an attack on the
“ we l fare stat e ” , wiping out subsidies for the poor,
a l l owing housing agencies to become dens of cor-
ruption while closing down entire cat e g o ries of gov-
ernment programmes. Hip-hoppers were on the
counter-offensive. As the Furious Five warned:
“ D o n ’t push me ’cause I’m close to the edge. I’m try-
ing not to lose my head. I t ’s like a jungle sometimes,
it makes me wonder how I keep from going under.”
On the technological front, h i p - h o p p e rs racked
up one breakthrough after another.While most rock
musicians of the mid-80s were perplexed by new

their new toys into unrelentingly dense, r e fle x i ve
gr o ove s. T h e n , as the anti-apartheid move m e n t
crested in the U.S., groups like Boogie Down Pro-
ductions and Public Enemy extended rap’s social
realism into broader discussions of political action.
But the lofty views of revo l u t i o n a ry nat i o n a l i s m
and hardrock spiritualism veered back to the streets
in 1989.A group of barely twe n t y - s o m e t h i n g s ,w h o

where deindustrialization,devolution,the cocaine

poor communities. Chaos was settling in for a long
stay and gangsta rap would be the soundtrack. By
c o n flating myth and place, the narr at i ves could take
root in every ’hood (neighbourhood). From Port-

Youth’s sonic forces
Perhaps all music, e v e n
the newest,
is not so much
something discovered
as something that re-
emerges from where it
lay buried in the
m e m o r y, inaudible as a
melody cut in a disc of
fle s h .
Jean Genet, F rench dra m a t i s t
and author (1910-1986)
were increasingly uninterested in whitewashed cultural
h a n d - m e - d ow n s.The 1988 advent of the MTV show,
“ Yo MTV Raps”, made A f rican A m e ri c a n ,C h i c a n o,
and Latino urban style instantly accessible across the
wo r l d .With its claims to street authenticity, its teen
r e b e l l i o n , its extension of urban stereotype and its
individualist “get mine” c r e d o, gangsta rap fit hand-
i n - g l ove with a generation weaned on racism and
R e a g a n i s m .These were not the old Negro spiri t u a l s
of the civil rights era.They were raw, v i o l e n t , u n d i s-
c i p l i n e d ,o f f e n s i ve ,“ n i g g a fie d ”r hy m e s , often homo-
p h o b i c, m i s o g y n i s t i c.
Gangsta rap drew new lines in the culture wa rs.
As the music crossed over to whiter,more affluent
c o m m u n i t i e s , gangsta rap inflamed cultural con-
s e rvat i ves like Bob Dole and neoliberals like 
C. Delores Tucker into demanding new corporate
and state repression. Gangsta rap was even show i n g
up in presidential debates.
P r o gr e s s i ves often speculate that gangsta rap
was foisted on a young public by reactionary record
labels. But to a great extent, the rise of these pop-
cultural trends was completely unplanned.Well into
the 1990s, major recording labels had no idea what
kind of hip-hop would sell. Unlike rock music,
which had long before matured into a stable and
culturally stale economy, hip-hop was like a wild
child whose every gesture and motion was a com-
plete surprise.
In the wake of the Los Angeles riots after the
brutal police beating of motorist Rodney King in
1 9 9 1 , gangsta rap and hip-hop marched towa r d
their gr e atest commercial success. D r. D r e ’s albu m
The Chronic topically moved gangsta rap away from
ghetto commentary to druggy hedonism, a n d ,w i t h
its polished chrome sound,onto mainstream radio
playlists. As cast by MTV and the expanding hip-
hop press, a rtists such as the late Tupac Shakur,
the son of a Black Panther revo l u t i o n a ry, m a d e
rebellion less a battle in the culture wars,and ever
more a mere marker of youth style.
The shrinking music industry also transform e d
the hip-hop scene. Between the early to mid-90s,
s e veral of the independent record label ow n e rs who
had been instrumental in launching the music sold
their companies to major labels,which also began
c o n s o l i d ating and reducing the size of their rosters.
As a result, grassroots acts no longer went from the
streets to the top of the charts. Management firms
guaranteed polished stars and funded the fa rm
teams that would take those stars’ places in turn.
The new hip-hop sound, c risply digitized and
radio-ready, became mainstream pop.
With the massive major label distribution jug-
g e rnauts behind them, it became routine for the
biggest hip-hop acts to debut with gold (half-mil-
lion) or more sales. A half-dozen magazines were
launched to take advantage of the new wealth of
advertising dollars. Hollywood’s big money came
c a l l i n g, making multimedia stars of rappers LL
Cool J and Ice Cube. Commercial tie-ins with
products such as Sprite or the Gap clothing prolif-
e r ated for second-level art i s t s. Producer Russell
Simmons began calling the hip-hop generation “ t h e
biggest brand-building generation the world has
ever seen”.The audience had matured into a mar-
ketable demographic.
Rebellion or
capitulation?
As U. S . author Don DeLillo has wri t t e n ,“ C a p-
ital burns off the nuance in a culture.”To be sure,
hip-hop has transformed popular culture across the
world. In Kenya, youngsters wear Adidas baseball
c a p s , Nike shoes and stage rowdy rap concerts that
look like ve rsions of Bambaat a a ’s romps in the
Bronx of yo r e . I t ’s unclear whether such perfor-
mances reflect a hybrid youth rebellion or capitu-
lation to global capitalism.
Yet somewhere within the culture lies the key
to understanding an entire generat i o n . This cul-
ture forged in fire still keeps its hand near the
m at c h . Rap rewards those who “ r e p r e s e n t ” i t s
a u d i e n c e s ’ r e a l i t i e s. If this often appears as cav i n g
in to baser impulses, h i p - h o p ’s defense is that it
speaks to young people as they are and where they
a r e .
And yet a growing movement believes that the
culture is liberat i n g . In cities across the wo r l d ,
youths use hip-hop to organise the struggles against
racism, police brutality, and the prison-industrial
c o m p l e x . For them, the culture and the politics are
inseparable—they are all part of a cohesive world-
view.Therein finally lies the story:hip-hip, born of
the destru c t i ve fires of the 1960s and 70s, has rekin-
dled creative flames of hope in a new generation.
The cleansing fires are still to come. ■

United on the dance flo o r ,r e ve l l e rs of different
ethnic backgrounds,sexual orientations and
ages dance wa l l - t o - wa l l , swe at i n g, s m i l i n g
and enjoying the DJ’s clever acoustic tri c k s. T h e
c o m b i n ation of loud, r hythmic music and visual
d i s t o rtion heightens the collective spirit as the
sound enters the crowd—machine rhy t h m s ,p o u n d-
ing dru m s , overlaid with a gospel spirituality of
p e a c e ,l ove and unity.Welcome to Body and Soul in
New York City, where the dream of danceflo o r
Utopia lives on and (in the words of one dance
music diva) “everybody’s free (to feel good)”.
At Body and Soul, DJs like Joe Claussel still
embody the determ i n ation to mix and mat c h — b o t h
styles of music and their audience—to remain aloof
from the machinations of the global entert a i n m e n t
gi a n t s , to find more in “club culture” than getting
high or getting paid. And it takes determ i n at i o n , f o r
over the past decade or so, “ d a n c e ” or “club cul-
ture”—based on electronic music and its deri va-
t i ves—has become an intern at i o n a l , m u l t i - m i l l i o n
dollar market despite the
e f f o rts of DJs like Claussel to
promote the dream of cultur-
al dive rs i t y, a rtistic indepen-
dence and unive rsal spiri t u a l-
i t y. For many of its devo t e e s ,
this club culture represents an
escape from the regi m e n t a-
tion of modern life and even a
r e t u rn to a pre-industri a l
pagan shamanistic utopia.
But before delving into
this global phenomenon, a
little history and vocabulary is called for.To begin
with, let’s deflate the generic use of the term
“techno” to describe anything with a thudding
electronic beat. Techno is actually one strand of
an ever-expanding genre generally called “elec-
tronic dance music”. A veritable cannibal, this
genre spawns a constant stream of variants as the
technological wizards, DJs, re-configure any kind
of music or sound—from a train whistle to the
chant of a Tibetan lama—within the thud-thud-
ding of a four-beats-to-a-bar rhythm. Two of the
major sub-genres are techno and house.
The club culture surrounding the music is in
some ways a reconfig u r ation of the disco era of the
m i d - t o - l ate 70s. All of us probably remember that
p e riod as one of poor taste and excess, symbolised in
the mainstream by John Tr avo l t a ’s white suit in the
A m e rican mov i e , S at u r d ay Night Fe ve r. But before
N o rth A m e ri c a ’s white, s u burban middle classes
adopted the commodified BeeGee’s S t ay i n ’A l i ve ve r-
sion of disco, the music was considered an offshoot of
funk and soul music. Commercial in aspirat i o n , ye s ,
bu t , at its best, fun and funky.D i s c o, under the pres-
sures of the “disco sucks”campaign (orchestrated by
disaffected rock fans) and the global over-exposure of
S at u r d ay Night Fe ve r,waned in popularity as the three
gr e at anti-commercial genres of popular music
e m e r g e d : reggae in Ja m a i c a , punk in the UK, h i p - h o p
in New York City. H owe ve r , the disco principle of
p l aying a smooth mix of long single records to keep
people “dancing all night long” l i ves on in the endless
stream of electronic dance music.
House music, in part i c u l a r , is often held up as a
kind of banner of cultural dive rsity owing to its ori-
gins in black and Latino discos,
where it first found its audience
(see p. 4 5 ) . One could point to
the 1980s, when A f rican A m e r-
ican producers / D J s , like Frankie
K n u c k l e s ,M a rshall Je f f e rson or
DJ Pierr e , began refining the all-
night dancefloor workouts at
u n d e r ground gay and mixe d
clubs in New York and Chicago,
like the legendary Wa r e h o u s e
from which house music deri ve s
its name. Or there is DJ Larry
L e va n , whose residence at New Yo r k ’s Pa r a d i s e
Garage not only defined a distinct sub-genre of its
own (“garage” is slower and more gospel ori e n t e d
than “house”) but set the tone for today ’s rave s1—
no alcohol,h e avy drug use, a mixe d ,“up for it crow d ”
and loud, p u l s ating music for 15-hour stretches with-
out a break.
The body and s o u l
of club culture
◗ Hillegonda C. R i e t v e l d
E l e c t ronic dance music is constantly spawning new strands 
of music like techno and acid house. Behind the thudding beats,
communities of DJs and dancers try to stay one step ahead of

colloquially used the word “rave” to mean “party” or “have
fun”. In 1987/88,UK youth began calling large, often
unlicensed parties “raves”. DJs play through the night at
these events which can attract thousands of paying
participants.
For many of its devotees,
this club culture
re p resents an escape fro m
the regimentation 
of modern life and even 
a return to a pre - i n d u s t r i a l

At the same time, in the post-industrialising con-
crete jungle of Detroit (Michigan), t e c h n o, a cooler,
more futuristic form of house—intensely laye r e d
r hy t h m s , often pierced by machine noises and recon-
figured over diva - vocals—emerged from a cross-Atlantic
dialogue between yo u n g, radical A f rican A m e ri c a n
p r o d u c e rs like Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May and
electronic Euro-pop, notably by Kraftwe r k , a Germ a n
e x p e rimental group of the 1970s.
By the mid-80s,a series of influential independent
record labels had appeared and the va rious strains of
N o rth A m e rican house, garage and techno we r e
e x p o rted to Europe, t ri g g e ring the rise of local va ri a n t s
and scenes.Which kinds of music were adopted where
is a story in itself.B ri e fly,wa rm e r ,more gospel-ori e n t e d
house music found a ready audience in Italy.N o rt h e rn
E u r o p e ,H o l l a n d ,B e l gium and Germ a ny proved fer-
tile ground for cold, hard techno, which those coun-
t ri e s ’ own electronic traditions had a hand in cre-
at i n g .H owe ve r , the UK took the lead in adopting and
adapting the new U. S .s o u n d s. Each va riant found a
B ritish audience: soul- and gospel-tinged house wa s
adopted by “ s o u l ” fa n s , while techno drew devo t e e s
from rock and even punk.
In 1987 a group of British DJs and pleasure-
seekers, enjoying the traditional British sun’n’fun
holiday on the Spanish island of Ibiza (a leg-
endary spot on the hippie trial, with a casual atti-
tude to drugs) discovered a potent mix. They
found that the empathy-generating drug MDMA
(aka ecstasy, “E”) proved the perfect accompani-
ment to a night in the clubs dancing to the new,
wobbly, futuristic sound of “acid house” (a vari-
ant of American house). On returning to rainy
England, these DJs tried to “recapture” the Ibiza
feeling by starting their own clubs and holding
unlicensed “acid house parties”, the prototype of
the “rave”. They began re-creating the feel of a
holiday club in the sun by taking over disused
warehouses or railway arches where an older mid-
20s crowd had an ecstatically good time.
The parties thundered on for about a ye a r
before parents and police panicked over their
“amoral” and illicit dimensions.The media had a
field day sensationalising the rave s ’ dangerous rep-
utations,which,of course,heightened their attrac-
tion for thrill-seeking teenagers. As the chill of the
B ritish winter set in, acid house parties went furt h e r
underground to escape police interference but by
summer 1989, they re-surfaced outside metropol-
itan areas, in leisure centres, rural wa r e h o u s e s ,e ve n
fie l d s.The scene mushroomed: one eve n t ,S u n ri s e ,
reputedly attracted 10,000 participants.
Within about five ye a rs of “the birth of the
r ave ” , the UK gove rnment passed a series of pro-
h i b i t i ve laws to crack down on the eve n t s. T h e
C riminal Justice Act of 1994, for example, p r ov i d e d
the police with sweeping powe rs to squelch any
e vent feat u ring amplified repetitive beat s. But the
repression had contrasting effects. F i rs t , by dri v i n g
the events further undergr o u n d , it actually spurr e d
their politicisation with the so-called DiY (Do it
Yo u rself) aesthetic: organise events out of a com-
mitment to independence and explicitly anti-
c o n s u m e rist political action. DiY rave rs were no
longer just organising dance events but musical
protests around environmental and social justice
i s s u e s. Groups like the legendary Spiral Tribe also
began spreading the “ g o s p e l ” of punk-like resis-
tance across the European continent by helping to
kick off “ Te k n i va l s ”( t e c h n o - f e s t i vals) in France and
G e rm a ny. Similar groups had a hand in deve l o p i n g
the major European Te c h n i val circuit, which now
includes one of the wo r l d ’s biggest part i e s : B e r l i n ’s
L ove Pa r a d e , which attracted an estimated 1.5 mil-
lion reve l l e rs from across Europe in 1999.

The discovery of the
DNA code, for example,
focuses on how you
can create different
species of beings by
starting from the very
smallest particles and
their components. ( . . . )
In music, we do exactly
the same.
Karlheinz Stockhausen, G e r m a n
experimental electro n i c
composer and musician (1928-)
At the same time, l e gi s l ation also led crowds to
r e t u rn to licensed nightclubs.The late 1990s gave ri s e
to “super clubs”,with rationalised administration and
marketing strat e gi e s. Clubs such as the Ministry of
Sound in London and Cream in Live rpool are hugely
p r o fitable bu s i n e s s e s ,flying in the latest “star DJs” t o
p l ay in a tightly controlled and regulated at m o s p h e r e .
O t h e rs , like Home and Gat e c r a s h e r , are export i n g
their branded goods (like t-shirts and records) ove r-
s e a s. Home even opened a club in Sydney (Australia).
Yet despite this commercial explosion, t h e
dream of club culture’s democratising power lives
on, particularly in how the music is produced and
c o n s u m e d . The entertainment industry has con-
ventionally followed a “ r o c k ”m o d e l , which relies on
bands signing long-term recording contracts with
record labels (production and distri bution compa-
nies) so they can afford to record an album of songs
in an expensive,commercial studio.The label then
sends the band out to promote the album by play-
ing live concerts in large venues.
Copyright chaos
Dance music has shaken up this model.
Instead of hiring and promoting an entire band of
musicians, the club and recording industries have
the much easier and affordable task of signing
and managing individual DJs who “play” the ever
more affordable digital equipment produced by
companies such as Roland of Japan and
Sequential Circuits of the U.S.With drum boxes
and synthesizers, technological wizards mimic
musical instruments. By “sampling” (a form of
digital copying), they can digitally record and
manipulate any sound, thereby throwing copy-
right law (and its principles of originality) into a
disarray from which it has yet to recover.
Creative individuals without musical training
and only rudimentary electronic know-how can
now produce dance music on their personal com-
puters with programmes like Cubase. Using digi-
tal equipment, a “track” (not a “song”) can be
composed, produced and mixed entirely by the
DJ/producer.
Although digital production is the standard in
house music, vinyl (records), as opposed to digi-
tal forms like CD, still predominate in clubs. DJs
seem to prefer the immediate tactile advantages
offered by the old “needle-on-the-record” that
allows special forms of manipulation (“scratch-
ing” records while rewinding and fast-forwarding
by hand to taunt and titillate the audience).
Turntables also seem to produce a warmer sound
than CD players. However, many local scenes,
such as those in Portugal or Belgrade (see p.43),
lack vinyl pressing plants and must rely on
imported vinyl from New York or London.
M a ny artists would like to remain indepen-
dent and set up their own labels, sometimes eve n
d i s t ri buting their products from the DJ booth of a
club or delive ring by car to specialist record shops.
H owe ve r , if that recording does become a hit, t h e
a rtist will soon need substantial investment to sup-
ply demand. Therefore artists are forced to do
deals with either independent or “ m a j o r ” d i s t ri b-
ution groups or to sell the track outright to a
record company. In this way, e ven independently
produced music is incorp o r ated into the global
music market.
While digital technology may have opened up
new possibilities for independent production,o b v i-
ously not everyone has equal access. For the vast
majority of the world’s population this technology
is economically out of reach and overwhelmingly
c o n c e n t r ated in the U. S , We s t e rn Europe and
Japan.Even in the West,the majority of producers
and DJs are male in keeping with social codes. E ve n
when female DJs do achieve a degree of “respect”
from club crow d s , they are marketed as sexual icons
in music magazines rather than technically com-
petent producers.When I mention my experience in
an electronic dance music group (as a progr a m m e r
and keyboard playe r ) , the first question I often hear
is:“Were you a singer?”
In the global loops of music production and
distribution, dance or club cultures are taking
root from Sao Paolo to Tel Aviv across a wide
political and cultural spectrum.Yet the spread has
done little to shift uneven power distribution;
Western global cities continue to dominate along
with the five major record companies which con-
trol distribution and abide by the stubborn dis-
tinctions of gender and class.We cannot help but
ask, “Is everybody equally welcome at this global
party?”We must question the diva quoted earlier:
Is everybody really “free to feel good”? ■

H i p - h o p ’s art of rebellion can trigger a battle against racism or raise 
the white flag to hyper-consumerism 
From Bogota to Beijing, hip-hop’s apostles are
spreading “the word”, striking chords of rage
and rebellion in privileged and poor kids alike,
in rich countries and poor.The wo r l d , it seems, is in
love with black America. But this is a treacherous
affair. Back in the homeland,a war is being waged
against this very same group. One of the frontlines
is the pri s o n - i n d u s t rial complex—an expanding
f o rt r e s s , with the U. S . r ate of incarceration (682
per 100,000) six to ten times higher than that of
most industrialised nat i o n s. Of the two million pri s-
o n e rs , 49 per cent are black and 17 per cent are
Latino even though they respectively represent 13
and 11 per cent of the population.Almost one in
three black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are
caught in the web of correctional control (incar-
c e r at i o n ,p r o b ation or parole).These men lose their
right to vo t e , lose their place as citizens, both in the
eyes of the State and in white society.
Outside of the penitentiari e s ,u n e m p l oyment is a
p rison of its ow n .At seven per cent,the rate may seem
l ow, but look closer and you find that this does not
recognise the “ d i s p o s a b l e ” p a rt-time wo r k e rs , g e n-
erally composed of ethnic minorities and wo m e n .
About eight per cent of A f rican A m e ricans are offi-
cially unemploye d , but the real bombshell is reserve d
for black yo u t h : almost 32 per cent cannot find a job.
Hip-hop is the “CNN of Black America”,raps
Chuck D of Public Enemy. Read this line with a
metaphorical eye to catch a crucial but not com-
plete reflection of the world’s Janus-like attraction
to rap’s art of rebellion. On the one hand, C N N
o f f e rs constant news coverage wo r l d - w i d e . I n
symbolic term s ,we find rappers cast as report e rs on
the frontline, o f f e ring live updates through their
music of the trials,tribulations and peculiarities of
neighbourhoods and cities, from Lagos to Frank-
f u rt . On the other hand, global media netwo r k s ,
like CNN, just scratch the surface and cater to
mainstream political “ t a s t e s ” by offering easily
digestible nuggets of infotainment. I l l u s t r ating this
n e g at i ve side, we find a few posses of To k yo rap-
pers and fans, for example, literally burning their
skin in tanning salons.This is an extreme example
reflecting the international mantra:“Be black for a
d ay, wigger for an aftern o o n ! ” [Wigger refers to
white people who copy black fashions.]
Contradictory impulses
Much like jazz and rock ’n’ roll in the past, h i p -
hop has made working class U. S . youth in general
and A f rican A m e ricans in particular a cultural
h e a rth for the intern ational market. Its iconic
p ower takes many form s , depending upon the par-
ticular political goals and constraints of its practi-
t i o n e rs. For some, hip-hop is used to attack pove r-
t y, oppression and gove rnment corru p t i o n . O t h e r
fans and musicians take aim at cultural ort h o d ox y
by glorifying gang violence, hy p e r - m at e rialism and
explicit misogyny. Often these contradictory ele-
ments take shape simultaneously.
In the heart of advanced industrial countri e s ,h i p -
hop serves as a liberation anthem for those oppressed
by racism and pove rt y. In the disadvantaged subu r b s
of Pa ri s , the lilting sounds of Senegalese MC Solaar

A Maori warrior claims

◗ Kerry Buchanan
Dean Hapeta launched New Zealand’s political hip-hop scene by linking the force of Maori
c u l t u re with the struggle of black nationalism to fuel consciousness and contro v e rs y
“Ni g g e r ! ” The biker’s insult blindsided the
e i g h t - year-old boy, s h at t e ring his vision of
both Maori and pakeha (white) society in
A o t e a r o a , the ori ginal name of New Zealand. T h e
verbal attack sharpened the boy ’s awareness of his
s o c i e t y ’s colour lines.A f t e r wa r d s , he couldn’t stand the
sight of his fellow Maori cast as the peaceful but sub-
o r d i n ate nat i ve . Nor could he look up to indigenous
gangs in his working-class neighbourhood of Upper
H u t t ,outside the capital We l l i n g t o n .Tu rning to white
s o c i e t y, he felt oppression. So the boy began to look
i n wa r d , to imagine a “new breed”—proud of his
M a o ri past and committed to a radical break with the
l e g a cy of colonial dominat i o n .
To d ay, at the age of 34, Hapeta will refer to him-
self as “one bad nigger” in reference to his hardcore
politics as a rapper. Here lies Hapeta’s strength and,
for some,his we a k n e s s : the ability to we ave Maori cul-
t u r e , language and political demands—from land and
fishing rights to economic equality—within the style
and context of black A m e rican hip-hop.Indeed Hapeta
and his group Upper Hutt Posse (UHP) have influ-
enced a generation of hip-hop bands and fans across
the country. Before these “ wa rri o rs ” s t o rmed the
s t a g e ,M a o ri music was generally marginalised like an
exotic trinket of the past used in the “ ri t u a l ”of enter-
taining touri s t s. By rapping in their language and
i n c o rp o r ating the sounds, values and history of their
p e o p l e ,Hapeta and like-minded artists shatter stereo-
types of what it means to be Maori .
NTM (Nique Ta Mère – “screw your mother”) besiege
the fascism of Je a n - M a rie Le Pe n ’s Front Nat i o n a l
p a rt y. Across the Channel, B ritish Asian rappers
Fun^Da^Mental enshrine the right to self-defence
against racist at t a c k s , while German hip-hoppers
incite respect for their Turkish ori gi n s.
Yet at the same time,hip-hop is also just one of
m a ny commercial products or props used for yo u t h
rebellion against the established orders of parents.
The music, dress and attitude are used to visibly
divide one generation from another. In Thailand,
male teens speed through the streets in swanky cars ,
pumped on the raw energy and anger of U.S. rap
without the slightest connection to the underlying
politics. In Kathmandu,teens use rap’s breakbeats
to break with tradition, perhaps temporari l y, i n
forging a “modern” identity.
As U. S . rapper L.L. Cool J rhy m e d ,“ t h e r e ’s no
c at e g o ry, for this story. It will rock in any terri t o ry.”
Cuba offers an “ a c a d e m i c ’s delight” in contradic-
t i o n s. Since 1996, the gove rnment has helped to
sponsor an annual National Hip-Hop Conference
s h owcasing local and intern ational stars , m o s t l y
from Latin A m e ri c a . According to the U. S . h i p - h o p
magazine The Source, Fidel Castro “sees rap music
as the existing revo l u t i o n a ry voice of Cuba’s future.”
Yet hip-hop also challenges the socialist vision when
fans at concerts proudly wear images of the U. S .
dollar bill on their hats and shirts and scream “ i t ’s
all about the Benjamins” ( r e f e rring to the image of
Benjamin Franklin printed on $100-bills).
Ironically, as post-Cold War hyper-material-
ism endangers the destiny of young people every-
w h e r e , the contradictory message of hip-hop
begins to make sense. A decisive feature of the
music/culture’s ethic is: to “want mine”, meaning
a share of society’s wealth.This desire operates at
both the individualist and collective levels. Do
you want “it” (luxury, security, etc.) for yourself,
or do you want a fair share for your community or
society? The urge is so complex that it’s difficult,
if not impossible, to find one without the other.
Take the case of South A f ri c a , whose tow n s h i p s
only recently produced some of the most disci-
plined and inspirational fighters for social justice.
N ow in “ m i xe d - r a c e ” areas around Cape Tow n ,
gangs take their cue from gangsta rap, calling them-
s e l ves “the A m e ri c a n s ” and “ t h r owing up the W ” , a
hand signal from West Coast gangsta rappers of the
U. S .The South A f rican example shows us that hip-
h o p ’s art of rebellion does not only lead to anti-
racist and anti-capitalist rebellion, but it often falls
victim to the pitfalls of systemic oppression against
which it attempts to rebel.
Hip-hop alone cannot rise up to the task of
political transformation—this is pop culture not a
manifesto. However, by looking at the particular
political situations and aspirations of its musi-
cians, we can trace its rise as an iconic power and
its demise when the assimilationist powers of the
capitalist economy flatten out the music’s rich-
ness to render it a message of personal gain. ■

H a p e t a ’s political consciousness did not flow
from the “cultural awa k e n i n g ” of the 1970s when the
M a o ri middle-class rediscovered its roots.He followe d
the learning curve of the streets, his wh a k a p a p a ( “ t h e
place where one belongs”).Tuned into the liberat i o n
music of Bob Marley, Ja m a i c a ’s legendary reggae
m u s i c i a n , the songs of resistance rang true in his
d i s a d vantaged neighbourhood, where police con-
f r o n t ations were a rite of passage. By va l o u rising the
h i s t o ry of former slaves and colonised peoples, t h e
music enabled Hapeta to discover “black outern a-
t i o n a l i t y ”or the collective struggles of the oppressed.
The impact of Malcom X
In fa c t ,H a p e t a ’s group UHP began in 1985 by
p l aying reggae inspired by the political message of Mar-
l e y, considered a ve ritable saint. But then a new set of
prophets landed in A o t e a r o a : U. S .r a p p e rs like A f ri k a
B a m b a ataa and Grandmaster Flash. B r e a k d a n c i n g
and rapping with crews in the street, Hapeta began
mixing a homegr own message with two major ingr e-
d i e n t s :e x p e rience and inspirat i o n .Landing a job at the
Justice Depart m e n t , he scoured the country to hear
M a o ri land gri e va n c e s.The second element flowe d
from ove rseas via The A u t o b i ogra p hy of Malcom X.
“The book knocked me out,”he say s.“It was gr e at
i n s p i r ation … that pride in the self and the ability to
do something about it.”The life of the black nat i o n-
alist—a cultural hero for his radical defence of racial
p ride in the 1950s and 60s—led Hapeta to see him-
self as a leader with hip-hop as a movement against
racism and a political plat f o rm for Maori interests.
I r o n i c a l l y, Hapeta was soon approached by the son
of Elijah Muhammad, the man who banished
Malcom X1 from the Nation of Islam, an influ e n t i a l
and controve rsial black militant gr o u p. To u ri n g
A o t e a r o a , Rasul Muhammad invited Hapeta and
his posse to perform in Detroit and meet the Nat i o n ’s
l e a d e r , Minister Louis Fa rr a k h a n , whose antisemitic
remarks and infla m m at o ry views on racial separat i o n
h ave sparked heated debat e .
In many way s , the trip reflects Hapeta’s ongoing
dialogue between Maori culture and A f rican A m e r-
ican influ e n c e s. At firs t , the balance was tipped
overseas. But with time Hapeta struck an equilib-
rium. For example, he recalls that “meeting Far-
rakhan was like going to the mountain-top.”T h e r e
was also the thrill of performing in Detroit and
New York and even being interv i e wed inside
H a r l e m ’s Apollo T h e at r e , where nearly all the gr e at
A f rican A m e rican musicians have playe d . B l a c k
audiences were apparently amazed by the fluency
and force with which Upper Hutt drew links
between Malcom X and Maori leaders like Hone
H e k e . Praise in the homeland of hip-hop helped to
legitimize Hapeta’s own sense of authenticity.
But back in A o t e a r o a , the fie ry brand of Maori
n ationalism has fuelled consciousness and contro-
ve rs y. In part i c u l a r ,his no-compromise stance on land
rights rattles more conciliat o ry activists and,at times,
Polynesian groups ori ginally from the Pa c i fic Islands
of Samoa, Nuie and To n g a . For example, at a 1990
c o n c e rt , Polynesian fans told Hapeta “to go home”
after he announced that Aotearoa was the land of the
M a o ri .The same ye a r , Hapeta successfully sued for
d e fa m ation the newspaper A u ckland Star over claims
t h at Upper Hutt Posse had barred two p a k e h a yo u t h s
from a concert .I r o n i c a l l y, the political talks pepper-
ing Hapeta’s shows are generally well accepted by
p a k e h a a u d i e n c e s.
Inner peace
Today, Hapeta is working as a solo artist under
the name Te Kupu (the word) instead of the form e r
D Wo r d . Two ve rsions of his latest album Ko Te
M atakahi Ku p u (or The Words that Pe n e t r ate) we r e
released in January:one entirely in Maori and the
other in English.These changes reflect Hapeta’s per-
sonal evo l u t i o n . Before the evils of society appeared
to dominate his work.Now, Hapeta seems to have
found an inner peace in his reliance on his culture.
Within the Maori community, he is respected as a
political leader for his dedication to Te Rao (M a o ri
language) and culture. But the wa rrior is still alive ,
staking claims in new terri t o ry : mainstream society.
“Promote it [Te Rao],push it into the mainstream.
Use its concepts of caring, social concern as a way
of changing at t i t u d e s ,” s ays Hapeta, who is pushing
for more than just space for his albums in record
shops and on radio stat i o n s. His words are intended
to penetrate mainstream society.
Hapeta’s horizons widen as he travels interna-
tionally to check out the local political plat f o rms of
other “conscious rappers ” in the UK, for example.
“I’m learning from all struggles,getting out of my
skin and [coming] back to share, as an ambassador
for the Maori people.” In many ways, this mission
r e flects the advice of the gr e at Maori leader, Sir A p i-
rana Ngata. In 1897, he wrote of the need to har-
monize one’s conflicting ideas while daring “ t o
wander in moments of the greatest exaltation and
wildest imaginings.” ■

“Th e y ’re down there on Loubet / T h e y ’ ve all
got big houses / They’ve got the cheek to
tell us / ‘We live in a ghetto’ / He smokes
foot-long joints / He’s pretty addicted / He looks
like a gangster / But he’s just scared / Of getting
thrown in the slammer.”
The four members of the group Perfect G’s
hammer the lines with “ at t i t u d e ” . B o r d e ring on
involuntary self-parody, this send-up takes aim at
the strew of other rappers who hang out in the same
neighbourhood of Oran as they do. None wo u l d
look out of place in the tough suburb of a French
city or a lower-class district of New Yo r k , with their
p ricey track-suits emblazoned with the logos of big
s p o rt swear firm s , the name of their group (Ol’ D i rt y
S h a m e , Killa Dox , Lord Squad, Black Eye s ,T h e
Commission) and their stage names (Oddman,
N.Fect, MC Ghosto, Flyman, Machine Gun,Vex,
Jigy, Baby, and so on).
The rappers of Oran,A l g e ri a ’s second largest city,
are to be found in a dow n t own area that has been the
haunt of  “ c o o l ” people for several decades. They sit
on the benches along the Avenue Larbi-Tébessi (for-
merly Avenue Loubet) or on the
steps of shuttered shops in
Mohamed-Khémisti (once
A l s a c e - L o rraine) Street,b e c a u s e
they can’t gather in the local
cafés and tea-houses. It is in this
200-metre radius area that they
g ather to shoot the breeze in the
l ate aftern o o n ,or whenever they
take time off from their studies,
their casual jobs or just from doing nothing.
This we s t e rn A l g e rian city is the birthplace of rai,
and of one of its leading stars , K h a l e d . But Oran’s
r a p p e rs and disc-jockeys aren’t too keen about each
o t h e r. “ T h e r e ’s just copycats left in rai these day s ,”
s ays H Rime,of the group MCLP. “ R a i ’s just for hav-
ing a laugh,”s ays Vex of the group Da Tox (Theory of
E x i s t e n c e ) . Je a l o u s y, almost hat r e d , is in the air.
The rappers see the many rai singers as the
main obstacle to their hitting the big time with their
provocative rants delivered at the speed of light to
music that doesn’t lose face to foreign rap:
“In the bat t l e ,A l g e ri a ’s there / With Oran guys rap-
ping / They’ll get revenge / They’ll settle their
scores /Their heads are hot / As boiling water.”
Electronic rai has been going for 20 ye a rs now
and its pioneers , all from ve ry poor fa m i l i e s ,are push-
ing on 40. Hip-hop became the rage about a decade
a g o, led by middle-class perform e rs. To d ay, it has
spread around the country (neighbouring Morocco
has only a small hip-hop scene), t u rning A l g e ria into
the rap leader of Arab nations and probably of the
entire Muslim world despite a meagre musical output
(each album only sells about 10,000 copies) consid-
e ring the dizzying number of gr o u p s.
Oran had about 40 hip-hop groups in 1990.
To d ay there are more than 60. A l gi e rs had 60 last
year and now has about 100.The capital has gi ve n
b i rth to a wave that has spared no city in the country.
Groups recite their rhyming ve rses in a weird frenzied
l a n g u a g e , switching from one tongue to another,
then to a third and a fourt h . In a single sentence,
F r e n c h ,English and the two forms of A r a b i c, l i t e r a ry
and spoken, are jumbled together.They invent a fle x-
i b l e , i r o n i c, language with bold descri p t i ve powe r:
“ T i g h t - fitting hijeb [the Islamic headscarf]/See-
through hijeb/Swimsuit hijeb/Flashy hijeb/Multi-
coloured hijeb/Crumpled hijeb/Frisky hijeb bought
on the Champs-Elysées/OK hijeb/Malay s i a n
h i j e b / R e m ovable hijeb/Air-
conditioned hijeb.”
E ve ry TV image fin d s
its way into their lyrics: wars,
the ozone layer, famine, fash-
ion models, films,contracep-
tives, soap operas,ads,hooli-
gans. Everything is evoked ,
compared and twisted to fit
the rhy m e . Then comes the
real problem of finding a proper recording studio.
Two famous groups in A l gi e rs , MBS (Micro-
phone Breaks the Silence) and Intik (“cool” in A l g e r-
ian slang) have already brought out their first CD in
F r a n c e , A l ge ra p on one of the big labels. Wa h ra p ( a n
a b b r e v i ation of Wa h r a n ,which is Oran in A r a b i c, p l u s
the word rap),a compilation by several Oran gr o u p s ,
came out in June 2000. The theme of the album is
summed up by MCLP’s refrain:“ We ’re microphone
fiends / We ’re telling you what we see / W h at e ve r ’s
going on / Some people steal / Others suffer.”
From a musical standpoint, the compilation is
well above the first A l g e rian rap albums that hit
F r a n c e . N o n e t h e l e s s , from the outset, A l g e rian rap
was well received in France. R a p p e rs met with sym-

ing their country. But the genre is still struggling to
establish itself: audiences in France are more drawn to
i m m i grant A l g e rian rappers such as Freeman and
I m h o t e p,of the Marseilles group IAM,Rimka of Col-
lectif 113, and non-Algerians like Joey Starr , of the
duo NTM, who worked on the albums of MBS and
I n t i k .
Last ye a r , A l g e rian rappers only produced a
dozen recordings on mediocre cassettes, but today
hip-hop products are springing up all over,reflect-
ing young people’s formidable need to speak out.
A l gi e rs is home to a constellation of rap gr o u p s
including the Hamma Boy s , Cause To u j o u rs , K -
Libre,Les Messagères,City 16,De-Men and Tout
Pa s s e . The flo u rishing resembles the explosive
growth of the written press during the democrati-
sation that followed the riots of October 1988.
Since those days howe ve r , disillusionment has
taken hold,as the A l gi e rs group Intik raps:“ M a n i p u-
l at i o n ,a g gr e s s i o n ,disappointment / T h at ’s what my lot
is today / My only crime is to hope and to dream.”
In A n n a b a , a town in eastern A l g e ri a ,L o t fi a n d
Wa h e b , of Double Kanon, who are considered the
best rappers of the day, openly denounce the coun-
t ry ’s ills:“They come and they come armed / Devils
or people / They come down from the Jewish ceme-
t e ry / To d ay it’s a crackdown / There ain’t no football
m atch / They come from the parade gr o u n d / Car-
rying the flag like in the Lebanon wa r / Up there peo-
ple are fleeing / The land’s become black.”
The war between the security forces and Islamic
fundamentalists (“terros” or terrorists in rap lan-
guage) is the focus of such hip-hop, along with
attacks on corru p t i o n ,o p p o rt u n i s t s , the “ t r a b e n d o ”
(black market),hatred,injustice and the blues.
“Zero morale”, the name of a song by the long-
standing Oran group V i x i t , sums it all up: “ T h e
Escobars / The Al Capones we have right here / We
have the mafia / What is left? / Engineers, doctors,
d i p l o m ats / Think about begging cigarettes / Jo b l e s s
people just hang around / The market economy / We
are condemned / Like animals in a zoo.”
SOS
But a new trend is emerging. In its early days,
rap was the privy of well-off middle class yo u t h s
who wrote their rhymes and worked out their tem-
pos in the comfort of fa n cy villas. N ow it is becom-
ing more democratic and inspiring young people
from underp rivileged backgr o u n d s. In short ,A l g e r-
ian rap has taken off across the social spectrum.
The rappers of MIA (Made in A l g e ria) rehears e
inside an empty container in their high-rise suburb of
A i n - e l - Tu r k ,while those belonging to the group Cot-
t a g e s , from the small town of Boufa ri k , sell ve g e t a-
bles and cigarettes on the street. I t ’s common know l-
edge that Réda,of the group Intik,had to sell his shoes
in the A l gi e rs flea market to pay for the last recording
hour of his gr o u p ’s first cassette.But eve ryone believe s
in just trying to get by,as products of local educat i o n
without a future, of satellite dishes spewing unreality
and of inescapable  pove rt y.
In early May 2000, about 30 groups gathered in
the city of Mostaganem for a hotly-contested rap
competition. The first prize went to a group from
Algiers. Its name was SOS. ■

“ A h , t h e y ’re the oldies!” And here are these ve ry
young people, s i n ging my songs. It also made me
happy to see youth still so attached to A f ri c a n
m u s i c, especially considering the influence of what
they hear on the radio. H o n e s t l y, when you listen
to these stat i o n s , you don’t know if yo u ’re in A f ri c a
or Californ i a . Not just because of the musical con-
t e n t …
T h a n d i s w a:Also from the tone and attitude of the
D J s.
Thandiswa, how would you describe kwaito?
Thandiswa: It’s about the energy of the time,
post-independence youth expressing their freedom
and excitement about everything being so brand
new. Listen to the music and you’ll find it’s dance-
oriented but there is also a very positive vibe in its
energy and message.
M i r i a m: I t ’s South A f ri c a ’s counterp a rt to rap.
K waito has its own way of spreading a positive mes-
s a g e . In our society, we have always passed messages
A recipe for kwaito
Let’s begin with the basic ingredients: South African
disco music, hip-hop, rhythm & blues, reggae and a
mega-dose of American and British house music.Mix it
all up,add loads of local spice and attitude and you’ve got
kwaito. Mostly, but not always, the lyrics are chanted or
rapped—not sung—over a slowed-down bass heavy,
electronically programmed beat.
As pioneering DJs like Oscar “Warona” Mdlongwa,
e x p l a i n , in the late 80s,“we started remixing international
house tracks to give them a local feeling.We added a bit
of piano, slowing the tempo down and putting in per-
cussion and African melodies”.
“ Lyrically we were inspired by people like Brenda Fa s s i e
and Chicco Twa l a ,” says another founding father, A r t h u r
M a f o k a t e. Brenda and Chicco were the rising stars of the
older “ B u b b l e g u m ” disco music.“ They were representing
us and talking about what was happening in the ghettos, a n d
they spoke in a mixture of English, Z u l u , Sesotho and
Iscamtho (slang).”
Kwaito is steeped in the ghetto, often reeking with a
roughneck attitude. But don’t be fooled into thinking
that these stars are cheap imitations of U. S. gangsta rap-
p e r s.These musicians are far too street-wise to glorify vio-
lence in crime-ridden South A f r i c a . Nor is there a need to
i n flame race relations after the victory over apartheid. Fo r
today’s youth,the struggle lies in securing a better eco-
nomic life.
In fact,kwaito producers were the first in the country
to launch their own black-owned record labels.The major
companies are now trying to cut in on the scene with their
own kwaito rosters but most of the big names are sitting
tight with the original labels. The genre is a major money-
s p i n n e r, with leading groups like Bongo Maffin , TKZee and
Boom Shaka releasing albums that clock over 50,000 in
s a l e s. If there’s a sound that represents young South
Africa right now, it’s kwaito. M.M. ■

Youth’s sonic forces
July/August 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 37
Rebel without a pause?
◗ Jeroen de Kloet
‘Bad boy’ Cui Jian, C h i n a ’s first long-haired rock icon, has pulled off another musical coup
by becoming the first artist to adapt hip-hop to the mainland. His hoarse voice has long
s i g n i fied anger, confusion and pain,especially during the 1989 student revolt when his hit single,
“Nothing to my Name”,became a veritable anthem.Despite the government’s attempts to
silence his voice by routinely banning his concerts, Cui Jian carries on with the rapper’s stac-
cato precision.
Cui Jian fired the first hip-hop salvo with the single “Get Over That Day”, which appeared
on a compilation album entitled Born on the First of July featuring rock bands from Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China reflecting on the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule
in 1997.While other groups celebrated “Chineseness”,Cui Jian questioned the wisdom of
the state and its people:“If love suddenly blossoms between my sister [Hong Kong] and me
[Chinese youth],how are you [the mother] going to deal with it?”Clearly put,what if main-
land youth falls for Hong Kong’s capitalist culture and rejects the political status quo?
M u s i c i a n s, record companies, journalists and academics often construct rap as the coun-
tercultural sound of the 1990s. Of course, this aura of rebellion neatly hides the sexism and
materialism so often displayed in the music.But in the case of Cui Jian,rap works. His most
recent album, an eclectic mix of rap and rock that has sold over 400,000 copies (not including
pirated versions),questions the nationalism and materialist Zeitgeist of post-1989 China.
To interpret Cui Jian as a political rebel fits in a little too neatly with the We s t ’s prevalent view
of China as an overtly politicized space.The desire to see dominant ideologies subverted indirectly
celebrates liberal Western society.H o w e v e r, perhaps Cui Jian has become more of a rebel against
the people than for the people.As China’s new generation starts feasting on the fruits of economic
r e f o r m s, Cui Jian confid e s :“ This is a time when people don’t believe in anything.The new gen-
eration just wants to have fun, to be cool, to have good [sex] and to have money …”Will Cui Jian
be upstaged in the “New China”, where people care more about economics than politics? No
m a t t e r, the rebel raps on:
We are so focused on making money that everything will be forgotten (…)
Ha! If you ask me what the next generation will be like;
I’ll give you a straight answer: why should I care?*
*“Idiots”from the album, The Power of the Powerless , 1998
◗ Ph.D. student at the Amsterdam School of Social Science Research
and expressed ours e l ves through song.This is why the
f o rmer gove rnment was so scared of musicians…
Thandiswa, do you feel that young people have a
negative attitude towards the old-school
musicians?
T h a n d i s w a: I t ’s not about negat i ve at t i t u d e s ,
but we didn’t gr ow up in the same situation of
s t ruggle against apart h e i d . The only time I
remember being stuck in a situation of revolution
was in 1985/86 [a state of emergency was declared
as massive student riots erupted]. A lot of young
people know all about the struggle but they we r e n ’t
directly involved.
With the new freedom in 1994 [the first free
elections], we started “eating” everything given to
u s , including stuff from A m e rica… Many in the
“kwaito generation” began living in town, discon-
nected from their gr a n d m o t h e rs , parents and
cousins.
M i r i a m: I t ’s as if kids today don’t realise just how
little time has passed since Mandela was in pri s o n .
Around the time of the second national elections in
1 9 9 9 , I heard some young people say i n g, ‘I’m not
going to vote because Mandela didn’t do this and that
and he promised he wo u l d .’ I had a serious talk with
t h e m :‘ W h at did you say? Yo u ’re living in towns and
attending multiracial schools.There was a time when
your parents and grandparents were being taught
under a tree and that is something you cannot forget.’
Miriam: I’d like to ask you a question,Thandiswa.
I’m on a committee to try to find ways of improving
HIV/AIDS education. How can we get the message
of prevention to sink into the minds of this
generation?
Thandiswa: I don’t know, Mama. People know
about the disease, people know people who are
dying because of it,but the message isn’t clicking.
People are having sex at such a young age. T h e
highest infection rate is among women betwe e n
the ages of 15 and 25. At 15, girls can’t make
rational decisions about using a condom, or not
going with a lot of boys… 
This is why many of the Aids campaigns are
using kwaito to push the message through to the
young kids. [ T h a n d i swa and a number of other
k waito stars are spokespeople for an anti-Aids cam-
paign called,“Love Life”.] 
M i r i a m: And the boys are not so nice.They force
their way… When I go on tour, I’m bombarded
with questions like, “What about all the rapes in
South A f ri c a ? ”You feel embarr a s s e d ,h u rt and, as a
woman, you could kill someone…
Thandiswa, Miriam’s music is known all over the
world.Are you aiming to do the same with Bongo
Maffin? 
T h a n d i s w a: Yah definitely! We would like to
become an international band.
Miriam: I hope it happens because one day the
Mama Makebas will be gone.During a UK music
f e s t i val in A p ri l , another major kwaito gr o u p, T K Z e e ,
was singing outside while I was playing indoors. I t ’s
nice to see the different generations together… It
shows we’re not standing still. ■

No sooner did I suggest a spot for taking pho-
tos of the 15 rappers and breakdancers we
went to meet in Aguablanca (Colombia) than
trouble began. In the cab ride to the interv i e w, I
passed a neighbourhood barbershop with a poster
of slain U.S. rapper Tupac Shakur in the window
and some funny haircuts painted on the glass—and
thought of suggesting it as a backdrop.
But on broaching the idea, a guy called
“Maligno” got in my face and said, “I ain’t down
with [agreeing to] the bit about the barbers. Some
people be say i n ’t h at the barbers be down with hip-
hop ‘cause they be doin’ the razor cuts [popular
among male rappers ] , but that ain’t necessarily so.”
The complaints continued, once we reached the
shop, as four of the rappers pointed to the name,
“New American Power”. Lalo, the photographer,
and I quickly suggested looking for another site.
Walking down a side street, I began explaining
t h at readers in other parts of the world would like to
see where they live .“ Ye a h , you wanna see how poor
we are,right?”announced Puto, a young man with
his hair braided in the dreadlocks of a Rastafarian.
“Here you go,” he said pointing to a shack at the
end of a dirt road.“I bet you wanna take a picture
of us in front of that shack, right?”
This went on for an hour. At the end, Lalo, a
we l l - t r aveled Colombian photogr a p h e r , was swe at-
ing, and not because of the heat. “These kids are
tough to work with,” he said with understatement.
Demanding precision
And I began to realise what hip-hop in Colom-
bia is all about—a search for identity among those
who have no other voice.These kids wanted Lalo’s
photos to show exactly who they we r e ,d own to the
last detail.They speak the “language of the world’s
ghettos”,as 23-year-old rapper and producer Car-
los Andrés Pacheco explained lat e r — but in their
own urban, South American, Colombian version.
This can mean including Cali’s particular salsa
cadence in a tune or even rapping about the nar-
cotics trade wreaking havoc in Colombian society.
In what were once wetlands on the southern edge
of Cali (the country ’s second city),Aguablanca is one
of Latin A m e ri c a ’s largest “ i nvasions”—areas on the
o u t s k i rts of cities where people seek refuge from ru r a l
violence and pove rt y.About 400,000 people of colour
from the Pa c i fic coast have settled here over the last
few decades,often finding more violence and pove rt y
in an urban form . Since 1994, the Aguablanca Cul-
tural Network has been trying to help,for example,b y
s u p p o rting about 25 of the area’s dozens of rap and
breakdance gr o u p s.
This support includes practical help like gi v i n g
the groups a gat h e ring place—a big help in light of the
fact that many of these kids live in single-floor houses
with up to eight siblings crammed into a few rooms,
while few institutions open their doors to bands of
t e e n a g e rs with dreadlocks and baggy jeans. One of the
n e t wo r k s ’l e a d e rs is Robinson Ruiz, who also belongs
to BS, a rap trio with a video—a status symbol of
s o rts in Colombia’s rap scene, barely a decade old.
“Throwing consciousness
out there”
Ruiz has called a meeting to discuss upcoming
e ve n t s , including the first annive rs a ry of a weekly radio
s h ow dedicated partially to rap called “The Zone”.
C a l i , with four radio stations now programming rap,
leads the nat i o n ;B o g o t á , the capital,has two.
The 15 rappers and breakers dwelled on the same
issue raised by the photos: i d e n t i t y.They talked about
whom to thank at the ceremony and why — m e a n i n g
who is really part of the scene and who isn’t .T h e y
also talked about money, questioning whether some
groups are paying for airp l ay on the radio.
A few days lat e r , rapper Carlos Andrés Pa c h e c o
highlights another aspect of the local hip-hop cul-
t u r e . Until recently, Carlos Andrés belonged to the
Bogotá gr o u p, Gotas de Rap, or Drops of Rap—one
of the few to have two produced CDs and to have
performed in Europe on three tours.
Pacheco told the story of the Colombia Rap Car-
t e l , a “trade gr o u p ”t h at he founded with members of
five other groups around the country three ye a rs ago
to help up-and-coming rappers get instru m e n t s ,s t u-
dio time,and so on.He spoke of “ p r o b l e m s ”with this
e f f o rt , including “different ways of thinking” a m o n g
m e m b e rs.“ M a ny of the groups think that when they
make a demo tape and play a few concert s , t h e y ’r e
going to get rich quick,” said Pa c h e c o. “They think
t h e y ’re going to ride in a Cadillac.They aren’t con-
scious of what rap is really about.”
For Pa c h e c o, hip-hop is aimed at  “ t h r ow i n g
consciousness out there” to the public, i n c l u d i n g
rapping about the complex relations between Wa s h-
ington and Bogotá as reflected in the war against
d ru g s. “The way I see it,” said the rapper, “ we sell
c o c a i n e , just like the United States sells arm s —

which also kill people.Both are part of the economy,
and it’s pretty hard for people in the countrys i d e
here to surv i ve on anything else.” Through his
lyrics,he tries to highlight positive options for kids
in Colombia’s cities who “ a lways have that door
open to gangs,drugs,prison…” Finally, he admit-
ted that it isn’t easy to raise such topics in a violent
c o u n t ry like Colombia. “ You have to be careful
about how you get the message across and make it
almost subliminal,” he warned.
For most of the rappers and breakers , there are
t wo kinds of messages wo rth communicat i n g :p r o t e s t s
or proposals.M a ria Eugenia Barquero,whose five - gi r l
gr o u p, Impacto Lat i n o, is one of a gr owing number in
C o l o m b i a ’s hip-hop scene.“ We ’re telling other kids to
take up culture, instead of violence and dru g s.To feel
proud to be Colombian. This is our proposal,” s h e
said before explaining that some groups focus on
protesting against the stat e , the ri c h , or the United
S t at e s. As for the gangsta image put across by many
U. S . r a p p e rs , she and most others view it as a com-
mercial development of little interest.
C u rious about her sense of identity as a person of
colour and how this might relate to her “ p r o p o s a l s ” ,
I asked which black Colombians she admired. “ M y
fat h e r ,” she said,“for all he’s done to raise us.”W h e n
pressed for more names, she asked “Do they have
to be black?” As for “people in general,” she men-
tioned U. S . female rappers TLC and Salt n’ Pe p p a .
As for being a young female rapper in a country
where most beer ads are adorned by bu x o m
blondes in bikinis, Barquero said,“ you feel that the
other groups and the public are all saying, ‘can she
do it?’And then we show that we can.”
The braided 18-year-old Barquero sees herself as
a potential ambassador of sort s. In about five ye a rs ,
she hopes to take her hip-hop message of non-vio-
lence around this country mired in civil wa r. But she
h a s n ’t figured out how to overcome a major barri e r —
m o n e y.
While discussing hip-hop’s meagre fin a n c i a l
r e wa r d s , Luis Felipe Jaramillo of Discos Fuentes
recounted two experiences he had recording rap
groups in 1998.The company didn’t agree with the
groups’lyrics “attacking the United States and the
Spanish conquistadors.” S o, they released the
records under another name: Factory Records.
Political demands vs.
commercial dividends
“ We did the project basically to help the
gr o u p s ,” said Ja r a m i l l o. Only 1,000 copies we r e
p ri n t e d , but “ ve ry few of them sold.” So Discos
Fuentes is not embarking on any major rap adven-
tures for now, aside from one group, Latinos en la
casa, or Latins in the House—who rap about sub-
jects like Juan Pablo Montoya, the young Colom-
bian dri ver who recently won the U. S . car race,
Indianapolis 500.About 1,500 copies of the albu m
will be produced. E ven Gotas de Rap has neve r
pressed more than 5,000 compact discs.
Orlando Cajamarca, a director who brought the-
atre to 150,000 of A g u a b l a n c a ’s kids over the last 14
ye a rs , questions rap’s future in Colombia for cul-
tural reasons rather than money. He sees rap as part
of globalisat i o n , tracing it to cable T V ’s arri val in
Colombia over the last decade, explaining that “ e ve n
the poorest slums here have television.” He wo n-
d e rs if rap isn’t just a passing fad and says leaders are
lacking in the Colombian hip-hop community.
Pat ricia A ri z a , producer of the group Gotas de Rap,
d i s a gr e e s. Hip-hop is a “ valuable cultural altern at i ve
for marginal sectors of this society,” said A ri z a ,b e f o r e
expressing faith in its financial future.“The bu s i n e s s
world always takes a long time to recognise the under-
ground wo r l d , but eventually it does.” ■
Aguablanca’s rap community may speak the “language of the world’s ghettos”but they want no borrowed images 
and labels.

In the black townships around Jo h a n n e s bu r g,
South A f ri c a , a new music culture is taking hold
among youth. In the small clubs and storefront
shebeens of these impoverished dormitory towns,
young people are eschewing the gove rn m e n t - s a n c-
tioned “ a u t h e n t i c ” music of Afro-jazz bands in
favour of recorded sound. Just as Jamaican sound
system operat o rs back in the 1950s or South Bronx
hip-hop DJs in the mid-1970s discove r e d , t wo
t u rn t a b l e s , a mixer and a microphone (made in
Ja p a n ) ,a supply of vinyl records (pressed in Europe
or the U.S.) and a competent DJ are all that is
required to get the party rockin’until dawn.
Local eruptions of globalised “club culture”
f ru s t r ate simplistic notions of authenticity (should-
n ’t A f ricans listen to A f rican music?) or attempts to
wrest a defin i t i ve meaning from youth culture
(linked so often to music).The township kids have
punctured and deflated the ove r - s i m p l i fied analysis
often surrounding Afro-diasporic music. In many
c a s e s , p aths are traced from A f rican ori gi n — t h e
m u s i c ’s “authentic roots”— through to its re-art i c-
u l ation (“whitening”) or commodific ation (“sell
out”) by greedy corporations based in the modern
We s t e rn metropolis. T h at argument falls apart in
places like the tow n s h i p s , where youth adopt music
with A f r o - d i a s p o ric roots (house music was born in
the black-latino urban gay clubs of the U.S.) bu t
routed through the cities of northern Europe. For
these young people, it represents a highly va l u e d
link to the West—much as their heavily logoed jeans
and baseball caps function as status symbols. But is
their rejection of Afro-jazz for Euro-house a subtle
form of reverse appropriation (whereby kids have
adopted the music as their own) or merely bad fa i t h
(a rejection of their culture)? Music scenes like
these are far too sophisticated to fit into the
cramped confines of binary (either/or) analysis.
Instead of delive ring easy answe rs , these music
scenes raise critical questions: is globalisation a sign of
the wo r l d ’s unific ation or cultural imperialism? Is this
e m b ryonic youth culture just another example of
o n e - way globalisat i o n — v i nyl singles being export e d

t i o n — youth as cultural bri c o l e u r ,mixing and mat c h i n g
symbols of prestige to create their ow n ,a u t o n o m o u s
subculture? Township DJs play house records at
around 90 beats per minute (bpm), far slower than the
130 bpm pace preferred by the European audience.
The reduced speed turns the  propulsive , h e c t i c
“ b a n gi n g ” into a glutinous and out-of-focus funk-
d u b , more in keeping with the drinking culture of
South A f rica than the drug-induced speed of European
s c e n e s. With a flick of a pitch control, black youth re-
signify and re-claim a Europeanised form of “ b l a c k ”
( A f r o - A m e rican) music.
Replacing rock
Are these young South A f ricans building new
hy b rid identities or dancing at the funeral of their
own cultural traditions? As Jeff Chang notes in his
assessment of hip-hop (see p. 2 3 ) , it is never clear
whether youth music cultures “ r e flect a hy b rid yo u t h
rebellion or capitulation to global capitalism.”
Therein lies the gr e at promise, as well as the
central dilemma, for academic analyses of youth-
music cultures, particularly “dance” or electronic
music (house music and its derivatives),which has
arguably replaced rock as the most globally signif-
icant popular form.Whether it is Detroit techno in
Birmingham, trance in Goa (see p.51) or funk in
Rio de Janeiro, there is no single theory to explain
the meaning of dance music scenes.We simply can-
not resolve the youth rebellion/commercial co-opta-
tion couplet once and for all.

Music is your own
e x p e r i e n c e, y o u r
t h o u g h t s, your wisdom.
If you don’t live it, i t
won’t come out of your
h o r n .
Charlie Pa r ke r, U. S. j a z z m a n
( 1 9 2 0 - 1 9 5 5 )
C a ribbean social theorist Stuart Hall reminds us
(taking as a gi ven the unequal distri bution of we a l t h
in a world “ s t ructured in dominance”) that the
basic principle of popular culture is contradiction,
and that there can be no guarantee that the “ m e a n-
i n g s ” encoded into cultural products (TV ads or
records) will be those “decoded” by the audience.
Nothing can be taken for granted in the terrain of
popular culture, especially that associated with
socially marginal groups.
The “ m e a n i n g ” of scenes organised around
exactly the same music can be markedly different in
different circumstances.The politics of buying yo u r
way into the “ d a n c e floor community” at one of the
globally branded and meticulously policed “ s u p e r-
clubs” is significantly different than that of illegal
r aves in Nort h e rn Ireland or Sarajevo where
“dancefloor communitarianism” takes on a more
c o nvincing tone in the light of fierce religious or
ethnic antagonisms that may be ove r c o m e , h ow-
ever briefly, on the dancefloor.
The rebellious genre of today can become
t o m o rr ow ’s mainstream music and the day after
t o m o rr ow ’s darling of nostalgia (see the strange
r e v i val of old rock ’n’r o l l ) . Counter-culture can
become over-the-counter culture.
Did I say “can become…”? I meant “ w i l l
b e c o m e ” . For this is one of the only reliable fea-
tures of popular music: it will change. A c c o r d i n g
to some technologically minded theori s t s ,d i gi t a l l y
produced dance music is like an alien virus with a
life of its own,continually splitting and reforming,
spreading and folding back on itself. S h o rt - l i ve d
sub-genres are constantly spreading: n e u r o - f u n k ,
acid jazz, t e c h - s t e p, happy hardcore, t ri p - h o p,
“nosebleed”and the list goes on
As electronic music spreads—through tradi-
tional circulation loops like import record netwo r k s ,
via radio airwave s , and through the Intern e t — i t
fuses with other musical forms and local styles like
fla m e n c o, dancehall reggae and Middle Eastern
p o p. It revitalizes itself through this profane contact,
and new genres emerge which feedback to the cen-
tres of production.The twin forces of youthful dis-
respect for ort h o d oxy and the ever-present threat of
c o - o p t ation by the content-hungry global enter-
tainment complex virtually guarantees change.
The politics 
of the dancefloor
But is this global mixing and matching evidence
of the increased hy b ri d i s ation of aesthetic form s ,o r
of the cannibalistic appetites of First World capital?
Are genres like Asian dance music—pioneered in
B ritain by Asian Dub Fo u n d ation (see p. 4 7 ) — s i g n s
t h at the West is finally coming to terms with its post-
colonial responsibilites, or another déjà vu phase of
S a i d ’s Orientalism (fetishism for the exotic)?
The challenge for the analyst is to disentangle
these processes. To ensure that this incredible
amount of creat i ve (and frequently under-
r e warded) cultural labour is gi ven its due, w h i l e
simultaneously ensuring that “ c e l e b r at i o n s ” o f
youthful creativity and hedonism are not merely
laying the groundwork and supplying the justifica-
tion for the dealers and profiteers—whether they
are peddling Ectsasy drug tablets, clothing brands
or fizzy dri n k s. C o rp o r ate capital needs no more

Dance music continues to grow and mutate,to
focus anxieties associated with youth—namely dru g
use and hedonism—to acquire associations with
local politics, to offer opportunities for fun, work,
c r e ativity and corp o r ate exploitat i o n .Like any cul-
tural form , dance music is always related to a socio-
political context. It may embody global aspirat i o n s
but it always has a local manifestat i o n : d a n c i n g
takes place somewhere, with particular kinds of
people present, in a particular socio-histori c a l
m o m e n t . The music has no meaning outside of
these concrete, but difficult to discern , r e l at i o n s ;
and even then its meanings are never complete or
resolved.As Yale professor Paul Gilroy reminds us,
“ c o m m u n i c at i ve gestures”, like dance, “are not
e x p r e s s i ve of an essence that exists outside the acts
that perform them.”
Academics, journalists and others interested
in what youth are up to have the task of tracking
these dancing bodies and mapping these “social
movements”. As in all cultural production, the
dialectic between resistance and exploitat i o n
plays out across its surfaces, refusing to resolve
itself into a transcendent either/or, always in the
process of becoming. ■

Two and a half hour’s dri ve through A u s t r a l i a ’s
dense bush north of Sydney, coloured lights
pulse on the crest of a hill as the low rumble of
bass creeps across the immense forest.At the height
of summer, the bush surrounding Byron Bay is alive
with underground techno eve n t s.A far cry from the
r e gimented and often alienating world of clubs that
electronic music in Sydney and other major cities
h ave become captive to, these events offer an escape
from city life and a dose of social politics.The open
space seemingly provides the freedom needed for a
c r e at i ve mix of artistic and political action. But the
flow of foreign tourists may arrest the scene’s deve l-
o p m e n t .
To some extent, t o u rism is at the ori gin of the
local techno scene. Building on the history of gay
dance parties which thri ved in Sydney from the early
1 9 8 0 s , B ritish tourists began bri n ging new music
and ideas in 1989 on the back of the UK rave explo-
s i o n .They organised underground events using the
same tactics to evade police at home: l ow-key adve r-
tising and venues announced by phone number on
the night.They also began setting up import record
stores and became leading DJs.But by 1991-2, l o c a l s
had taken ove r. E ve ry we e k e n d , four or more eve n t s
could each draw several thousand people.
Meanwhile,The Vibe Tribe—a loose group of
f o rmer punks, s q u at t e rs and community activists—
began holding free parties in Sydney’s public spaces
to blend grassroots community activism with the
energy and futurism of rave culture. They also
began setting up fundraisers for va rious progr e s-
s i ve community organizations while forgi n g

alliances with local environmental groups to high-
light issues such as indigenous land rights,the loss
of public space to pri vate interests, and nuclear dis-

e ve rything from community festivals to part y -
aligned protest events such as “Reclaim T h e
S t r e e t s ” in Sydney: multiple soundsystems we r e
wheeled out at major road intersections, drawing
thousands of spontaneous reve l l e rs to highlight the
environmental effects of the automobile industry.
But by 1995, r e p r e s s i ve regulations and police
raids forced the raves off the streets and into the con-
trolled confines of clubs.The Vibe Tribe disbanded
and some leading members like Kol Diamond we n t
to Byron Bay,where environmental alliances had been
forged by other collectives like Electric T i p i .“ O ver the
last twenty ye a rs or so Byron has become ve ry much
the nerve centre of ‘ a l t e rn at i ve lifestyling’‚ in this coun-
t ry,” explains Diamond. “The va rious feral subcul-
tures and capitalist Greenies mix freely with New A g e
g u ru s.They sit lazily in Bohemian cafes discussing the
politics of making money and genetically modifie d
s oya beans whilst surfing the days away… The local
council is Green [part y ] , the local newspaper is heav-
ily anti-development and critical of large corp o r at e
bu s i n e s s e s , and it seems like the whole town and sur-
rounding areas have in common a desire to keep the
Big Mac out of town and keep low - d e n s i t y, l ow - i m p a c t
d e velopment as the main strat e g y, largely because
Byron Bay is totally dependent on touri s m .”

Youth’s sonic forces
July/August 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 43
“Tune in and drop out!” The old slogan
rings globally as teenagers , t we n t y -
somethings and adolescent-thirties plug
into music to disconnect from the worries of their
worlds. But in Belgrade, bands of young techno
fans are “dropping out” of society with a vehe-
mence which reflects more than mere defiance of
authority. In the Serbian context of rampant
n ationalism and corru p t i o n , their apoliticism
reflects a hardcore political statement as they cre-
ate a parallel universe whose members flow like
free electrons through the circuits of clubs,
underground parties and pirate music networks.
Outside of the Balkans, the act of “ d r o p p i n g
o u t ” usually means ignoring social pressures and
parental pleas to “plan for the future” by studying
or working hard to achieve social status and fin a n-
cial success. In Belgr a d e , youth are not just reject-
ing parental expectations but the probable future

C h ris Gibson, a lecturer in geogr a p hy at the
U n i ve rsity of New South Wales and avid rave r ,
spent six months in Byron Bay to map the music
s c e n e ’s internal politics and its position in a net-
work of global music exchange.“There is an ongo-
ing debate in Byron about whether to tap into the
backpacker market or remain locally focused,”s ay s
Gibson.“The issue here is whether local political
imperatives are necessarily compatible with a less
p o l i t i c a l l y - s p e c i fic global trance music mentality
associated with backpacker tourism.”
Take the case of local DJs fundraising for a for-
est blockade. Are backpackers really interested in
the forest or just attracted by the “ a l t e rn at i ve ”
nature of the event? Will local events become over-
shadowed by larger, purely musical ones with the
drawcard of DJs from the global trance scene?
Diamond is less concern e d .“ M aybe this was the
risk four ye a rs ago when a ve ry tight crew of [inter-
n ational] trance DJs and promoters hit this area ve ry
suddenly and in a rather calculated move ,” he say s.
“They were looking for a new foothold with which to
exploit their corp o r ate agendas.Byron quickly became
ve ry fashionable to visit but it was always ve ry expen-
s i ve to live in compared to Thailand and India, so only
those who actually did desire a more altern at i ve eco-
f riendly way staye d .”
The debate over tourism is now spilling beyo n d
the music community to fuel a conflict with local
a u t h o ri t i e s. Tensions erupted over plans for a
techno Millennium Eve . According to Diamond,
“three techno parties were threatening to at t r a c t
more people and more attention than the tow n ’s
official celebrations.”
Tourist dollars
To begin with, the local council does n o t m a k e
a ny money from the free-spirited bush part i e s.
S e c o n d , these bri n g - yo u r - own-booze events tend
to draw large crowds away from bars and ve n u e s
in tow n .The rave crackdown in Sydney (1995) wa s
largely due to pressure from the alcohol industry.
So it was not a total surp rise to find “police harass-
ment at the parties all throughout the night,” a s
Diamond descri b e s , “from set-up to dawn leading
to the confiscation of equipment and charges
being laid.” For Diamond, the crackdown repre-
sented the council’s decision “to put the touri s t
dollar before the artistic desires of the local com-
m u n i t y.”
With the party season quieting down over the
colder months, Byron crews are waiting to see how
the political climate develops. Meanwhile,Organ-
a r c hy is working to release more music from Byron
locals to reinforce artistic and political indepen-
d e n c e . “All struggle is local,” s ays Diamond,
“ g l o b a l - a nything [music industry, t o u ri s m , e t c. ]
reeks straight away of something to be consumed in
large doses…”. ■
of the majori t y : d e p ri vat i o n . Only the elite stand a
chance of economic escape in this country where
five per cent of the population owns 80 per cent of
the national we a l t h . In the last ten ye a rs , an esti-

left the country, mostly heading West to countri e s
like Germ a ny, A u s t ria and the Netherlands.

opposition “ l e a d e rs ” and no respect for the estab-
lishment—neither of which offer a clue on how to
heal the wounds of gr owing pove rty and cri m i n a l-
i s ation of the stat e .
This is not a resurrection of the generic youth
rebellion:“No future!” By creating a parallel uni-
verse via music, these techno tribes seem to be
building on the Temporary Autonomous Zone
(TAZ)1 of philosopher Hakim Bey, the anarchist
guru based in New York. Imagine “pirate utopias”
or “mini-societies living consciously outside of
the law and determined to keep it up,” writes Bey,
“even if only for a short but merry life.” For Bey,
a head-on collision with the state amounts to
“futile martyrdom”. Instead of wasting time in
the dogma-eats-dogma world of revo l u t i o n
(wherein one ideology is replaced by another),
consider the joys of uprising.“The TAZ is like an
uprising which does not engage directly with the
State,a guerrilla operation which liberates an area
(of land, of time, of imagination) and then dis-
solves itself to re-form elsewhere/elsewhen, before
the State can crush it.”
Veritable temples
for the alienated
B e l grade offers the ideal terrain for the TA Z .
The omnipresent State is riddled with cracks for
the tribes to disappear in. In fa c t , the techno scene
literally developed undergr o u n d : in the basement
of the State unive rs i t y ’s Faculty of A rts in 1992
(the apex of the former Yu g o s l av i a ’s bloody dis-
m e m b e rm e n t ) . The basement club A d a d e m i j a
staged a music coup, replacing the old revo l u t i o n-
a ry avant-garde of rock ’n’ roll bands with the gad-
get wizardry of techno disc jockeys.Tribes or bands
of teenagers and twenty-somethings form e d
around a common goal: to escape wa r - t o rn reality
for the futurism of techno. The undergr o u n d
e vents were like temples for the alienat e d : by pul-
s ating to a collective vibe, adherents silently swo r e
a l l e giance to the positive yet ephemeral life on the
d a n c e flo o r.
S l owly they built a parallel unive rse by almost
b o rr owing a page from Bey’s book: t u rn the negat i ve
into positive . Reject politics not by apat hy but by
c r e ating altern at i ve netwo r k s. Reject the capitalist
notion of wo r k , not by laziness,but through the black
e c o n o my.And so the techno tribes re-claimed space
in clubs and abandoned wa r e h o u s e s.Without cash
for equipment, they stealthily borr owe d , b a rt e r e d
for and recycled old turntables and speakers.W i t h-
out access to a record or CD fa c t o ry, they smuggled
p i r ate recordings from Bulgari a .
It’s as if they followed Bey’s words to the letter,
and yet most have probably never even heard of the
anarchist.Ask them about their motivation to find
vague talk of “positive change”and club culture as
“the only sane way of surviving” and fighting the
system.The lack of eloquence can be forgiven, for
these are doers ,l e aving philosophy for thinkers like
B e y. They don’t bother with what “ wa s ” or “ w i l l
be”—instead they raid the status quo. For example,
in 1996/7, the opposition held three months of
d e m o n s t r ations after the gove rnment tried to annul
their victory in local elections. Instead of following
the leaders,the techno tribes staged their own car-
nivalesque events.
D u ring the NATO bombing campaign against
B e l gr a d e , hundreds of reve l l e rs met for techno
p a rt i e s , organised by two 20-year olds, M a r k o
Nastic and Dejan Milicevic, k n own as the Te e n a g e
Techno Punks.The uprising flo ated with the sense
of utopia which, as Bey wri t e s ,“ e nvisions an i n t e n-
s i fic at i o n of eve ry d ay life, or as the Surr e a l i s t s
might have said, l i f e ’s penetration by the Marve l-
l o u s.”
Attacking the State’s
nostalgia for the past
“ S t rike at the structures of control!” e x h o rt s
B e y. And so the techno tribes file past the police
and take aim at the real source of gove rnment con-
t r o l :i d e a s. D e voted to the futurism associated with
m u s i c, they attack the Stat e ’s nostalgia for past
“glory”,while trampling on the notion that money
can pave the way to a better future as the State’s
printing machines churn out the bills of hyperin-
flation.By “dropping out”,the tribes won’t topple
the gove rnment or change their society. But that
was never their goal.As the underground leaders,
Teenage Techno Punks, e x p l a i n , “ I t ’s not easy to
be a drop-out, but,then again, it’s not easy to stay
put under the circumstances.This was the only way
we knew to bring about positive change.” ■

Youth’s sonic forces
July/August 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 45
Disc jockeys have been spinning records for
decades. But when in the 30-year history of
electronic dance music did they rise to
become highly influential cultural icons? Not only
h ave club DJs become gat e k e e p e rs within local
music industries;some are now cast as highly paid
musical ambassadors , t r aveling around the globe
to spread the latest musical trends.
Is this because club DJs know best how to cast
a spell on a danceflo o r ,h ow to “ wo r k ” a record in a
way that makes it seem at once familiar and excit-
ingly new, how to bring a crowd to a peak not just
once during an evening, but several times? Or is it
simply because DJs are finally being paid hand-
somely and enjoying the celebrity status that comes
with money and media exposure?
The answer probably is “all of the above ” o r
“somewhere in the middle.”The place to go look-
ing for the roots of DJ culture are the urban centres
long known as hotbeds of
musical creativity. Places like
New York City. E ven a bri e f
h i s t o ry of club deejaying must
b e gin here, in the pre-disco
era of the late 1960s and early
1 9 7 0 s , at the crossroads of
A f rican A m e rican expressive
culture and collectively real-
ized gay sensibilities which
together form the core of con-
temporary social dance culture.
Dance music culture, whether associated with
disco, club,or house music, has its roots in the Big
A p p l e . New York became the disco capital of the
world by the mid-1970s, thanks to a vibrant under-
ground dance culture with local African American
and Latino gay men at the helm. The city’s leg-
endary discotheques,such as Sanctuary,The Loft,
Better Day s , Paradise Garage, among others ,
emerged from the fusion of three distinct types of
social dance environments prevalent in the 1960s,
which featured recorded music with or without a
D J. The first precursor was based on the French
d i s c o t h e q u e ,e xe m p l i fied in Manhattan by exclusive
establishments such as Le Club, and later Arthur
and Cheetah.Their design and clientele reflected
the post-war idea of a disco as an exclusive wat e ri n g
hole for a jet-set clientele.
This elitest conception changed, h owe ve r , i n
the late 1960s and early 70s as the discotheque
absorbed the social changes transforming A m e ri c a n
society at large. Most import a n t l y, young urban-
i t e s — p a rticularly ethnic minori t i e s , women and
g ays—who had been (or felt) pushed to the margi n s
of A m e rican society, became increasingly vo c a l .
These groups included anti-establishment pre-
Woodstock hippies, s t ruggling poets, m u s i c i a n s ,
a c t o rs , and other art i s t s , as well as a mix of wo r k i n g -
class Caucasians,African Americans and Latinos.
Though they did mingle to some extent, t h e y
tended to frequent separate dance establishments,
based mainly on their sexual orientation.
Heterosexual crowds gathered at clubs like
E l e c t ric Circus or Zodiac, where DJs played an
eclectic repertoire of rock, rhythm & blues (R&B)
and early forms of what is now marketed as world
m u s i c. In contrast, young gay men and wo m e n
socialised at neighbourhood clubs or bars , e i t h e r
legal or unlicensed, generally in ethnically homo-
geneous areas like Harlem,
the Hispanic barrios of
Harlem or the Upper We s t
S i d e . While the music
pumped from either a juke
b ox or a DJ set, older men
(sometimes in drag) often
acted as initiat o rs and at times
p r o t e c t o rs of younger gay s
into “the Life” (a socially and
sexually active , yet often
secret,life).Some of these local gay bars were reg-
ularly raided by police,a practice which ended with
the legendary Stonewall Riots of Greenwich V i l-
lage on June 28, 1 9 6 9 .T h e r e , for the first time, g ay s
fought police harassment collectively and success-
fully, to the extent that after Stonewall, many les-
bians and gays began to see social dancing not sim-
ply as a pastime but also as a powerful means of
building a sense of communal identity.
While the first gay disco in New York State wa s
probably in Cherry Grove on Fire Island, the firs t
urban venue that made disco notori o u s ,f o r b i d d e n ,
and at t r a c t i ve all at once was the Sanctuary on Man-
h at t a n ’s West 43rd Street, which in 1970 became
the model for later underground gay discos. T h e
S a n c t u a ry also gave birth to the first club DJ as pop
s t a r. D a n c e rs and groupies alike flocked to see and
hear DJ Francis (Grasso), who had mastered a new
i n s t ru m e n t , consisting of two turntables and a mixe r ,
and a new stage: the DJ booth with its controls of

DJ democra c y :
made in Ja p a n
◗ Kenji Gamon
In the past decade, c o m p u t e r-operated musical
devices have been replacing the human musi-
c i a n ,while hard-drives and portable digital record-
ing gear are making tape-based recordings obso-
l e t e.These increasingly affordable digital tools are
reaching a new breed of musicians who previously
had little or no chance of breaking into the main-
stream music industry.With Japanese companies
l i ke A k a i ,Roland and Yamaha churning out the lat-
est in DJ gadgetry, there is no better place to wit-
ness the revolutionary changes in digital music
than To k y o.
The “Made in Ja p a n ”l a b e l ,which was hitherto
seen only engraved on the back of these electronic
i n s t r u m e n t s, is now proving to be a marke t a b l e
cultural export product as well. In fact, Japan is
enjoying a sort of pop-culture renaissance as DJs
l i ke Ken Ishii, T s u y o s h i , Fumiya Tanaka and DJ
sound and light to fire non-stop, wa l l - t o - wall danc-
ing on the adjacent flo o r.
By 1973, national magazines such as Billboard
and Rolling Stone and NYC radio stations began
featuring “disco” hits and programmes. Fans who
c o u l d n ’t hear enough of the music on the radio and
in clubs began buying records in numbers that
forced recording companies to pay attention to
music they’d been ignori n g . Like their forebears on
radio in the 1950s, club DJs became influ e n t i a l
enough to “break”or introduce new records to the
p u b l i c. This rising status enabled them to have
direct input into the records themselve s. For exam-
p l e , New York DJ David Todd introduced R&B pro-
ducer Van McCoy to a Latin dance called the Hus-
t l e , leading to the production of an epony m o u s
record which became a big hit for McCoy while
Todd went on to develop the disco department at a
major company, RCA Records.
Fighting off
“the death of vinyl”
B e t ween 1975 and 1985, the lines between stu-
dio producers , e n gi n e e rs , s o n g w ri t e rs and DJs
became increasingly fuzzy. Instead of just spinning
records at clubs, DJs ventured into the recording
s t u d i o s ,b ri n ging the same workplace concepts and
techniques of mixing music, c r e ating new sounds
and re-mixing songs.As remixe rs , they used the tech-
n o l o gical tools in ways their designers never dreamed
o f. For example,a simple synthesizer/sequencer, t h e
Roland T B - 3 0 3 , marketed in 1983 for rock musi-
cians looking to emulate a bass guitar, became the
staple of the acid house sound. DJs didn’t just use the
little box but “ p l aye d ” its pitch, a c c e n t , r e s o n a n c e
and frequency controls, similar to the way they
“ p l aye d ”r e c o r d s. By adding sequencers and dru m
m a c h i n e s , they not only increased and dive rs i fie d
their own club repert o i r e s , but produced new tracks
and ve rsions to be sold to the public. In the process,
disco became house music.
As this transfer of technologies and aesthetics
b e t ween the recording studio and the DJ booth
i n c r e a s e d , so did dance music’s profit a b i l i t y. S i n c e
the rise of tapes and compact discs, DJs have been
the main economic force in fighting off the “ d e ath of
v i ny l ” ( r e c o r d s ) .The main institutions of the dance
music industry—the independent label, the record
pool (companies distri buting promotional records to
DJs who in return issue feedback sheets), the under-
ground club, the specialty retail store—tend to be
staffed by DJs who base their activities on an eve r -
expanding  concept of their art and skills as musicians
and perform e rs.The increase in status from record-
spinner to remixer and record producer has trans-
f o rmed the club DJ from cult figure to cultural icon.
Dance music is now a global phenomenon, t r ave l i n g
with a set of DJs who have spun their own ve rsion of
the worldwide we b : the “ I n t e rnet of dance music” i s
made up of axes linking local dance cultures.
For New York DJs, the first major axis ran through
other U. S . cities with vibrant or emerging local dance
c u l t u r e s. From New Yo r k ,D a n ny Tenaglia moved to
Miami where he spent his form at i ve ye a rs as a DJ
before returning to Manhattan where he is now one
of the most in-demand remixe rs (creating new ve r-
sions of old tracks by other art i s t s ) .Another New Yo r k
D J , Frankie Knuckles,m oved to Chicago, f o l l ow i n g
an inv i t ation to become the resident DJ at the Wa r e-
h o u s e , a gay black club. N o t e wo rt hy is that both
Krush find success in the European and A m e r i c a n
music marke t s.
Ken Ishii, 3 0 , is the most famous of these rising
s t a r s.About ten years ago, Ishii sent a demo tape
to the Belgian techno label R&S, which immedi-
ately signed him on with a contract,not only shin-
ing an international spotlight on the young mae-
stro but also enabling him to gain recognition in
his own country for the first time.H o w e v e r, I s h i i ’s
now blossoming career (currently fuelled by the
powerful marketing muscle of Sony Records in
Japan) represents only one side of the cyberpunk
artist-turned-Cinderella story.
In the quiet urban sprawl of Tokyo’s Komaba
d i s t r i c t ,Kisei Irie,2 8 , and Takashi Saito, 2 4 ,are try-
ing to follow in the footsteps of their rising techno
gods. In Irie’s one-bedroom apartment,the duo
are cranking out a fervent mix of techno grooves
under the name A / F + BAD KARMA. These two
bedroom DJs cashed in years’ worth of savings
(about $2,000) to press 300 vinyl copies of their
four new tracks at a Czech record plant.
But producing the music is only one step in
the struggle. Distribution is a veritable battle as
the growing number of “bedroom DJs” c o m p e t e
to get local record stores to purchase and dis-
play their vinyl creations. “Sure Japan has prof-
itable stars like Ishii, but that doesn’t mean the
i n d u s t r y, record stores or clubs are trying to cul-
t i vate new talent,” says Irie.“Guys like us have to
start at the bottom.”
M e a n w h i l e, the skyrocketing number of DJs
has yet to trigger an explosion in creativity.
“Everybody sounds the same,” says Zatiochi
Nakano, 35,a studio engineer and digital instru-
ment expert. “But that’s the case everywhere
because kids want to create ‘cool’ sounds to
please as wide an audience as possible.” Fo r
Nakano, the new digital instruments are revolu-
tionary because they allow the musically
untrained to create their own material. H o w e v e r,
the personal pleasures of creativity should not
be confused with talent. As Nakano concludes,
“Good music requires good creators and that’s as
old as the hills.” ■

while stocking up on local records. They also have
since returned to the Big Apple to live and work as DJs
and remixe rs.
New tradewinds
The second axis leads across the Atlantic, from
Chicago through New York to London. A r o u n d
1 9 8 6 / 7 , after the initial buzz surrounding house
music in Chicago, it became clear that the major
recording companies and media institutions were
reluctant to market this music, associated with gay
African Americans,on a mainstream level. House
artists turned to Europe, chiefly London but also
cities such as A m s t e r d a m , B e r l i n , M a n c h e s t e r ,
Milan,Zurich,and Tel Aviv.The rest is the history
of what became rave culture, a European yo u t h
dance phenomenon which is still going strong.
A third axis leads to Japan where,since the late
1 9 8 0 s , New York club DJs have had the opport u n i t y
to play guest-spots to audiences who are as much
r e m oved geographically and culturally from
African\American and gay sensibilities as are their
European counterparts. Still, local dance cultures
f o rmed and continue to expand in To k yo and other
major Japanese cities. At the turn of the millen-
nium, the tradewinds of the DJ are reaching new
d e s t i n at i o n s , like Sao Pa o l o, Mexico City and
African capitals like Dar Es Salaam.There, a new
generation is enriching a tradition which so far has
no textbook or manual, nor has it received com-
p r e h e n s i ve documentat i o n . R at h e r , it is carri e d
f o rth orally, by DJs who learned from those who
came before them.Keep on! ■
Asian O v e rg ro u n d
The contradictions of Euro p e ’s rage for ethnic exoticism take centre stage in an interview 
with Pandit G of Asian Dub Fo u n d a t i o n , a UK band serving up a searing mix of jungle rhythms,
rap and ‘ t raditional’ sounds steeped in social justice
The global music industry makes a fortune by mixing
various strands of music, often tra d i t i o n a l , w i t h
g e n res like hip-hop or techno. Is this a replay of
classic capitalist exploitation—extract raw materials,
package and sell them back to the “ n a t i v e s ” ?
People have always mixed music from else-
where and turned it into their own style. For
example, bhangra [now very fashionably sam-
pled] is really an indigenous form of Punjabi folk
music created in Britain (see p.49). The early
migrants from the Asian subcontinent largely
came to Britain to work in cotton and textile mills
after the war, particularly in the mid-to-late 50s.
Many came from Punjab, which straddles the
border with Pakistan. So a generation coming
right up to the late 60s was listening to Punjabi
folk music but mixing it with the dominant music
form of the time, rock.That meant using electric
guitars, drum kits as well as traditional instru-
ments. What used to be a big musical troupe
could be replaced with technology and just three
or four members.
But on the opposite pole,you always find peo-
ple out to exploit ethnicity or exoticism. In
Britain, why do musicians like Kula Shaker [a
neo-hippie rock band] need to go to India to find
inspiration or symbolism? Why couldn’t they have
gone to places like Southall [an Asian neighbour-
hood] on their doorstep in London?
What do you think of “Asian Kool”—or the curre n t
rage for Indian-inspired music and fashion? 
We could be talking about Asian Kool,
C a ribbean Kool or A f rican A m e rican Kool. T h e
people pushing this kind of thing have recognised
t h at there is no strong white We s t e rn notion of cool

amongst youth.Largely black identity is mixed up
with being anti-establishment. Exoticism makes
this idea sell a bit but it’ll only be forgotten in a few
years’time.
In the UK, you’ll see people in the streets
wearing their little bindis on their foreheads and
thinking they’ve made an anti-racist statement.
But they wouldn’t talk with Asian people working
in a cornershop. By focusing on the exoticism,
people can say, “These Indians don’t mind being
poor because they’re spiritual.”
What do you think of the “New A s i a n
U n d e rg round”—a tag often attached to Asian Dub
Foundation (ADF)?
I t ’s an easy sound-bite to market the music. B u t
we have to take a British pers p e c t i ve because of the
h i s t o ry of colonialism.White society in the UK largely
sees the Asian community as being homogeneous.Ye t
the handful of musicians that make up this “ A s i a n
U n d e r gr o u n d ”can be Muslim,H i n d u ,C h ri s t i a n ,S i k h
or Buddhist and [ori ginally] come from a geogr a p h i c
area three times bigger than the UK.
“We ain’t ethnic, exotic or eclectic. The only ‘e’ we
use is electric,” rhymes a line from an ADF song. Do
you ever feel the burden of representing an ethnic
community?
We only represent ourselves. There is a line
precisely on that from our album, Rafi’s Revenge:
“Culture is always on the move.There is no fixed
point.” We can also hold this up to white society,
which imagines an ideal time when there was
some pure British society—which never was. Just
like there was never a pure Indian society.
We wo n ’t accept any pigeonholes.The tag that
gets used most to describe us is:political band.We
get journalists say i n g, “Once you get through the
p o l i t i c s , the album isn’t bad.”We believe that eve ry-
thing is political. F i ve Asians gettin’ on stage, p l ay i n ’
guitar and sampler,is political.
You’ve said that ADF has never been directly
censored because of its strong anti-racist political
platform*, but how can the mainstream media and
music industry indirectly stifle a group’s message? 
A backlash is slowly set up. First the media
presents radical music as something new. Even
though what’s new is that the political platform is
reaching a wider audience. But by reaching more
people, you upset the status quo, which doesn’t
sell advertising copy. So what does the press do?
They set you up as celebrities, isolate you and
then try to crush you.
It wouldn’t be direct censorship from the
record company—you’d just find that your record
isn’t available in the shops.You don’t get any tour
support. There’s many ways of stopping a band
from reaching a broad audience. ■

even Pink Floyd,and a host of other stuff I neither
recognise nor am keen to.Then,someone decides
i t ’s time to party in earn e s t . The music stops. A
fresh cassette is inserted and when the first strains
of the new number are heard, the room explodes in
a collective roar. I t ’s Daler Mehndi, the dancing
Sikh,the undisputed king of bhangra pop. Finally,
the adrenalin is flowing and there’s not a soul who’s
not on the dance floor. For a few hours, it’s a long
list of Indipop singers,mostly bhangra.

relentlessly ahead. As a result, the landscape of
urban India has been transformed beyond belief.
Large tracts of rural India also show signs of change,
especially in the agri c u l t u r e - rich Punjab.
R avaged by the partition of India in 1947, P u n j a b
s aw the gr e atest mass migr ation in history. Millions of
Hindus and Sikhs crossed over to the Indian side, a n d
millions of Muslims to Pa k i s t a n . For a generation or
m o r e , the Punjabis have worked industri o u s l y, a n d
m a ny have moved up the economic ladder, thanks to
the green revo l u t i o n . In addition to a massive migr a-
tion notably to the UK after part i t i o n , a huge number
of young Punjabis are continuing to migr ate to the
C o m m o n wealth and other distant lands. Some of
the money being earned abroad is repat ri ated back to
I n d i a . Cities are full of fast cars , h i - fi home enter-
tainment systems, M c D o n a l d ’s and ubiquitous sat e l-
lite antennae in rich as well as poor neighbourhoods.
E ven villages now have ATMs (cash distri bu t e rs ) ,
and eve ryone seems to be
we a ring Nike shoes, R ay - B a n
sunglasses or Benetton shirt s —
there are more fakes going
around than the genuine stuff,
but who cares? All of this
h a s also been accompanied
b y heightened polari s at i o n
b e t ween the rich and the poor
w i t h i n the country, bu t , a g a i n ,
who cares? Its p a a a a rt i e e e e t i m e .
So there you have it, t h e
p a r a d ox of bhangr a : its emer-
gence as an I n d i a n f o rm in pre-
cisely the decade when its lis-
t e n e rs have become more integr ated into the wo r l d
market and its pat t e rns of consumption.Talk to the 13-
to-23 high-consuming set and the refrain heard most
i s :“ I t ’s o u r m u s i c.”The pride that accompanies stori e s
of Indian musical success in W h i t e m a n s l a n d , U K —
Apache Indian,Bally Sagoo, e t c.—is real.“ We are no
longer only consumers of other people’s cultures—now
we produce the music that the world wants to listen
t o.” But wa s n ’t the bhangra boom born in the We s t ,
and hasn’t it too been imported to India? “ Ye s ,but it’s
I n d i a n,d o n ’t you understand? It’s o u r guys there who
are making the music.”
But why bhangr a , I ask.“ B h a n gr a ’s got the beat .I t ’s
ve ry danceable,” I am inform e d .I s n ’t all folk music, I
a s k .“I guess.”S i l e n c e .“Remember dandiya ? ” asks an
older listener, r e f e rring to the form of folk music and
dance from the we s t e rn Indian state of Gujarat which
was all the rage in the 80s. “ T h at was danceable.” S o
w hy has it been deposed by bhangr a , I ask him.
“ S i m p l e ,” he say s. “ E a r l i e r , the Gujjus [Gujarat i s ]
were the single largest expat [ ri ate] populat i o n .N ow, t h e
Punjus [Punjabis] have taken ove r. And so has their
m u s i c.”Ye a h ,t h at i s s i m p l e .To o s i m p l e ,m aybe? But why
d o n ’t we hear gidda? It’s from Punjab and as danceable
as bhangr a . “ S i m p l e ,” I am told again. “Gidda is
wo m e n ’s song.H ow can men sing or dance to it?”B u t
i s n ’t bhangra too masculine? It’s sung by men.“ Ye a h ,”
he say s. “ T h at ’s the point. B h a n gra is m e n ’s s o n g .S o
e ve rybody can dance to it.”Ye a h , simple again, I guess.
A Punjabi friend passionate about his music pro-
vides a different explanat i o n .“ I t ’s all a question of iden-
t i fic at i o n ,” he say s. “ B h a n gra has become associat e d
in the popular mind with the culture of Punjab.T h i s
has happened because of Hindi fil m s , which have
used bhangra more than any other Punjabi folk form .
People now think that bhangra is all there is to Pun-
jabi music. Much of what we hear today is now h e r e
near bhangr a , but it all gets called that because of the
use of the d h o l [a percussion instrument slung on the
shoulder and played on both sides with sticks]. A ny-
thing on the d h o l and with some balle balle [a generi c
c ry expressing happiness] or k u d i ye [Punjabi for gi r l ]
is just assumed to be bhangr a .”So what is it? “Most of
it is kitsch.You know, just taken from here and there
and mixed together.W h at e ver wo r k s ,wo r k s.Then we
get to hear a million va ri ations of that .Till something
else clicks.” In the meanwhile, of cours e , music com-
panies have made millions.
Would you believe it, t h e n —
much of what we think is
b h a n gra is not bhangra at all!
“Who cares?”, s ays an 18-ye a r
o l d .“ I t ’s Indian, and we u n d e r-
s t a n d i t . Not like the English
songs where you unders t a n d
only one line.” Really? W h at
about the king of bhangr a - p o p,
Daler Mehndi, I ask. H ow
m a ny people know what he
sings in between h i s o n e - l i n e
refrains? “ T h at ’s because people
d o n ’t listen carefully,” she say s.
“Some of his songs are beau-
t i f u l . They are really p h i l o s o p h i c a l.” P h i l o s o p h i c a l ?
“Ye e e e s.You know, t h e r e ’s one where he talks about love
being like spinning ya rn on a wheel…”She quotes the
Punjabi lines.Ye s , I admit, the lines are beautiful.B u t
the language is far from simple to unders t a n d .“ Ye a h .
I t ’s t ra d i t i o n a l. My grandmother explained it to me,”
c o n fides my young fri e n d . N ow that ’s interesting.
And what did grannie think about it? “ O h , she is just
a m u s e d . She could never have imagined that such
songs could be played in discos and part i e s.” I s n ’t she
offended? “Not really. She says we live in times when
the dollar ru l e s.They will sell their mothers if they can
make some money.”But is she happy with the fact? “ I
d u n n o. I guess she’s not too worked up about it, s i n c e
I get to learn some Punjabi that way. I ’ ve never been
in Punjab. . .”
So bhangra has come full circle. C r e ated by the
hardy Punjabi peasant to celebrate harve s t s , m a r-
riages and other joyous occasions, it was exported by
his expat ri ate grandson to the we s t . There it wa s
r e m i xed with techno, rap and reggae of black neigh-
b o u r h o o d s , and with Hindi film music as we l l .R e i n-
vented thus, it gets exported back to India by large
music corp o r ations who make enormous profits in the
p r o c e s s. And here in India, it helps rich kids of an
increasingly anglicized elite rediscover their own ru r a l
h e ri t a g e . In completing this loop, of cours e ,b h a n gr a
loses all links with the mat e rial life of the peasants who
c r e ated it. But who cares? It’s p a a a a rt i e e e e t i m e . ■
C reated by the hard y
Punjabi peasant to
c e l e b rate harvests,
marriages and other
joyous occasions, b h a n g ra
was exported by his
expatriate grandson 
to the We s t .
Th e r e ’s nothing
remarkable about it.
All one has to do is 
to hit the right keys at
the right time 
and the instrument
plays itself.

Youth’s sonic forces
July/August 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 51
In a letter addressed to the then prime minister,
Rajiv Gandhi,the Goan activist group Citizens
C o n c e rned About To u rism (CCAT) wrote in
1990:
“ O ver the last ten ye a rs , hippies and similar
backpack tourists have virtually taken over (…)
They live here without visas or passports. …They
lie around nude on our beaches and practice and
p r o p a g ate free love and free sex. D rugs are an inte-
gral part of their relaxed way of life.They are para-
sites who thri ve by sucking the life-blood of our
nation—OUR  YOUTH.”
While doing fie l d work for my Ph.D. on touri s m
problems in Goa, a former Po rtuguese colony in
southern India,I’ve encountered many such emo-
tional reactions to the white traveler/hippie culture
Fear and l o a t h i n g in Goa
◗ Arun Saldanha
‘Sex drugs and rock ’n’ roll’ is the traditional source of moral panic 
for parents and police. But in Goa, p a rents fear that their youth will 
be corrupted by cultural imperialism 
◗ Centre for Media Sociology,
Free University of Brussels
existing uneasily in traditional coastal villages.
These reactions lead back to a general Goan patri-
otism, “tested” by the perceived cultural threat of
t o u ri s m , especially in the nort h e rn village of
A n j u n a . In the early 1990s, hippie tourism gave
way to one of the world’s most famous rave scenes
with Goa trance music, which not only at t r a c t s
hordes of travelling rave rs and package touri s t s
from the UK, Israel, Germany, France, Japan and
other countries, but many local youths as well.
Panic about young people succumbing to sup-
posedly “ f o r e i g n ”p l e a s u r e s : does this sound fa m i l i a r ?
Youth culture is,by defin i t i o n ,d e v i a n t . It subve rts the
meanings adults gi ve to decency and health, r e s p o n-
sibility and tastefulness, night and day. I t ’s not ve ry
s u rp rising that adult disapproval results in hy s t e ri c a l
media reports and often in restrictions or police
action aimed at subve rting the subve rs i o n s.
A turning point
in the 1980s
Though sociologists have studied how genera-
tional aspects of moral panic are connected with
class, gender, ethnic and sexual dimensions, there
h a s n ’t been much attention on the i n t e r c u l t u ra l
i s s u e . In Goa, moral panic becomes a Nort h - S o u t h
i s s u e , one of insidious “cultural imperi a l i s m ” .S o m e
local youth—boys, not girls who generally stay at
home in India—are thought to prefer We s t e rn
m u s i c, d rugs and sexual habits to “traditional VA L-
UES like honesty, hard wo r k ,d i s c i p l i n e , good moral
b e h aviour and pat ri o t i s m ”( C C AT ) . For many par-
ents, journalists and activists,white foreigners are
forcing their culture in a colonial way upon the
helpless kids of Goa.
The reality is more complex.In the 1970s, the
hippies lay naked and stoned on drugs, listening
to their music, while the locals worked for a liv-
ing. Two radically different worlds co-existed
within the same village, but there were never
problems to speak of. In the 1980s, the party
crowds grew to the thousands, the music became
electronic (thus louder),and the drug market bet-
ter organised.

Those who cannot
dance say the music is
no good.
Jamaican pro v e r b
Goa trance parties traditionally happen at full
m o o n , C h ristmas and New Ye a r , on the beaches,
in forests and on hills.They are normally free,g o i n g
on till late morn i n g, keeping the village awake with
the throbbing kick dru m . Goa trance music is a
fa s t , hypnotic kind of techno, with flu c t u at i n g
streams of bleeps, squelches and soundscapes
vaguely reminiscent of Eastern harm o n i c s.A n j u n a ’s
hippie past is reflected in fluorescent paintings and
performances to match the music’s heavy psyche-
delic thrust, further enhanced by the use of illegal
drugs like LSD, Ecstasy and hashish—this music
i s n ’t called t ra n c e for nothing. The psychotropic
atmosphere and imagery is simulated on the Inter-
net and at psy-trance parties around the wo r l d ,
from Slovenia to Sydney,Thailand to Tel Aviv.
M a ny Goans also take part by selling c h a i
(Indian tea), snacks and cigarettes or by dri v i n g
t a x i s , renting out rooms, b i k e s , p a rty spaces and
sound equipment. They also sell booze, c l o t h e s ,
d ru g s , f o o d , cassettes and paraphern a l i a , f r o m
chillums (traditional Indian hash pipes) to incense.
And because loud music after 10 p.m. is illegal in
Goa, cops and corrupt politicians can earn piles of
rupees by routinely charging b a k s h e e s h ( b ribes) for
the parties and fishing for drug possession. In short ,
Anjuna’s party scene is as much of interest to for-
eign freaks and dealers as it is to Goans.
Yet this economic dimen-
sion is ignored by the media
and activists. Instead they
demonise the scene as one
which cat e rs to foreign plea-
sures while corrupting Goa’s
g ove rnment and seducing its
yo u t h . This is moral panic,
a rt i c u l ated along a postcolo-
n i a l , intercultural dimension.
M o r a l , because there’s alway s
a puritan and pat riotic under-
t o n e . Pa n i c, because the effects
of Goa trance are exaggerat e d .
Moral panic then gets in the way of admitting that
m a ny Goan boys and men genuinely enjoy the par-
ties without the drugs (too expensive) and without
sex (contrary to widespread belief in the area, o n e
d o e s n ’t copulate at a rave ) .W h at ’s more, gr ow i n g
n u m b e rs of much richer youth from Mumbai (for-
merly Bombay) are discove ring the rave Mecca in
their own country.Weekends and holidays are spent
basking in the festive glory,although they are careful
to throw away their hippie clothes before returning to
D a d , Mum and their yuppie jobs.
I’m not saying Goans, Indian touri s t s , M u m b a i
y u p s , white package touri s t s ,b a c k p a c k e rs and trance-
heads all happily dance together in pluralist commu-
n i o n . I’m only saying that the audience is extremely
d i ve rs e , far more so than in the We s t .The starkly ad hoc
manner of organising these parties makes it difficult to
call the phenomenon a planned strategy of narcotics
m a fia , m u l t i n ational capital, or wacko India-imita-
t o rs intent on turning the young Indian generat i o n
into equally wacko We s t - i m i t at o rs. I t ’s true that
t o u ri s m ,d rug traffic k i n g, c o rru p t i o n , and stereotyp-
ical imaging of Goa/India all feed on the inequality
existing in the world between North and South,w h i t e
and brow n , rich and poor. But deducing that Goa’s
youth has been sucked into a “ f o r e i g n ”hedonism and
m at e rialism is a totally different mat t e r.
Can we conclude that moral panic isn’t justifie d
in Goa? Well, moral panic is never justified, as it’s
a lways based on exaggeration and misinterp r e t a-
t i o n .W h at is justifia b l e , is putting things in per-
spective and in concrete terms. Many Goans make
good money during winter by virtue of the trance
parties. Busting the events,as the government and
police seem eager to do lately, will hurt these poor
locals much sooner than the big hotel owners and
d rug dealers.The repressive climate reinforces cor-
ruption and prevents open debat e .And the touri s t s
will only head someplace else.
L i k e w i s e , m a ny local young men and Indian
l ower-class tourists enjoy dancing to the music.W h o
are intellectuals and parents to argue that this fun is
not “ r e a l ” but induced by foreigners? How do they
k n ow that the “ f ri e n d s h i p s ”b e t ween locals and for-
e i g n e rs are purely utilitarian? Labeling Goa trance as
“ n o n - G o a n ” and “ c o l o n i a l i s t ” denies intercultural
dialogue and possible solutions to the problems.
I r o n i c a l l y, the middle-class Catholic parent culture
forced upon Goan yo u n g s t e rs is more clearly a result
of aggr e s s i ve colonialism (of
Po rt u g a l ) , than the Goa
trance subculture they’re fli rt-
ing with. For it is nothing
more than fli rt i n g : after the
t o u rist season, i t ’s back to
Indian village or small-tow n
life again. In the eyes of danc-
ing Goans and foreigners ,
Goa trance is Goan.
N ow let’s accept that
Goa trance is part of Goa.
Does that resolve all of the
problems? Of course not. Po l-
lution is part of Goa and it’s not okay.M a ny problems
in Goa (like pollution and corruption) are connected
to rave touri s m , but we cannot just blame the touri s t
i n d u s t ry and foreigners.F i rs t ,we need to identify the
p r o b l e m s. A Goan boy decides to pierce his nose in
keeping with trance fa s h i o n . Is that a problem? Or
should we be more concerned that cops pay to be
posted at the coast to collect b a k s h e e s h? Let’s deal with
the second firs t .L e t ’s not judge,like many Goan city-
folk do, from wild second-hand stories of the malign
l u n atics of Anjuna or from inconsistent pat ri o t i c
denials of intercultural exchange.
I sense the reader frow n i n g . Listen to this Euro-
pean wise-guy spilling big words about other peo-
p l e ’s problems, calling them naïve and on top of
that getting credit for it… same old North/South
d o m i n ation but now on a unive rsity leve l .But con-
sider another possibility. Instead of hiding behind
the façade of detached social science, w hy not try to
s t i m u l ate debate on how to solve Goa’s rave -
tourism problems? ■

January 14, 2000, Oakland, California. It was
with eager anticipation that more then 12,000
people descended upon the Oakland Coliseum
to see rap superstar Juvenile and his Cash Money
Click.The musicians were at the top of the charts,
while their songs and videos were being played on
radio and TV stations across the country. Earlier in
the day, they made a jovial appearance at KMEL,
the area’s leading music radio station. Joking with
fa n s , they promised to gi ve the performance of a life-
time.Little did we know what was in store.
Around 11 o’clock that night, local TV show s
were interrupted by frantic reports of mayhem at
Oakland Coliseum. H o rri fic pictures seemingly
depicting groups of thuggish young men beating up
helpless concert - g o e rs plastered TV screens as more
than 100 police offic e rs in riot gear swooped on the
C o l i s e u m . The show was halted and the sold-out
c r owd told to go home, without refunds for their
$ 5 0 - t i c k e t s.A fight had broken out, i nvolving about a
dozen men.
The aftermath was swift and damaging. Local
club owners pointed to the Coliseum fiasco as an
excuse not to host similar eve n t s. For example, t h e

p r e s t i gious Gavin Music Convention was scheduled
to take place in the Bay Area the following month.
Plans were well underway to organise several large
hip-hop show c a s e s.They were all unceremoniously
cancelled. In fact, the hype surrounding the Coli-
seum event spread well beyond Californ i a .C o n c e rt
venue owners from across the country called Oak-
land police officials to gauge whether or not they
should host similar concerts.Yet many people saw
the Coliseum management as being ill prepared.
They were understaffed and therefore slow to let
people into the venue (which raises tensions) and,
more import a n t l y, s l ow to respond once the trouble
broke out. This criticism was barely considered,
h owe ve r , in the public hearings subsequently organ-
ised on a possible moratorium on rap concerts.
The backlash resulting
from isolated events
Making mat t e rs wo rs e , the incident occurred at a
rough time for rap because some of its supers t a rs ,
including Puff Daddy and Jay - Z ,had been invo l ved in
extremely violent incidents. Puff made intern at i o n a l
headlines when he fled a shooting in a New York City
The highly controversial Puff Daddy accepts the Rap Artist of the Year award from Billboard magazine in 1997,three years before he was implicated in a
nightclub shooting in New York.

n i g h t c l u b. Police later found an unregistered gun
inside his car and arrested him in late December last
ye a r.The bad news came on the heels of another dra-
m atic arr e s t :G r a m my award winner Jay-Z was accused
of stabbing fellow record exe c u t i ve Lance “ U n ”R i ve r a
for supposedly bootlegging his mat e ri a l .
Incidents like these have made the issue of hip-
hop violence a main staple for media commentat o rs.
Should we ban the concerts? How concerned should
we be about the lyrics and imagery promoted by
some of the acts?
S e rious discussion requires proper pers p e c t i ve .
Ye s , there are violent incidents associated with hip-
hop, but they do not define the mindset of the cul-
t u r e .B e ware of the trap of stereotyping.The alleged
illegal actions of superstars like Puff and Jay-Z are
an embarrassment, but they do not represent the
music and culture.
For example,violent incidents abound at soccer
m atches around the world but they don’t defin e
the sport or a particular community. In many cases
l aw enforcement and civic officials understand that
the cost of doing business is a likelihood of vio-
l e n c e . Hence fences are built to keep ri val fa n s
a p a rt , while special security units patrol the stands.
Hip-hop has never been afforded such treatment.
I am not suggesting that we turn concerts into
police zones.Yet obviously large gat h e rings require
special precautions.We must also recognise that the
media have an interest in hyping may h e m .These sto-
ries sell. For example, nobody was killed, let alone
t r a m p l e d , at the concert I descri b e d .The violence wa s
c o n fined to a small area and invo l ved less then 20 peo-
ple out of the more than 12,000 who at t e n d e d . Not a
single arrest was made, despite the presence of about
100 police offic e rs. N e ve rt h e-
l e s s ,TV stations saw fit to inter-
rupt their regular progr a m m i n g
to inform the public about the
fig h t s. Compare that sort of
urgent coverage to the l a ck o f
attention gi ven to the crow d
violence that occurs regularly
at Bay Area football games.
The violence surr o u n d i n g
the “Big Game”b e t ween Stan-
ford Unive rsity and ri val Unive rsity of California in
1997 made the Coliseum concert look like a picnic.
The entire field, including the goal posts, was
d e s t r oyed by marauding fans who trampled innocent
b y s t a n d e rs. Police offic e rs were even at t a c k e d .Ye t
there were no TV highlights on the evening news.T h e
n e w s p a p e rs wrote rave reviews of the game and barely
mentioned the fig h t s.A p p a r e n t l y,no-one would dare
t a rnish the reputations of two ve ry prestigious uni-
ve rs i t i e s.The following ye a r , the fans went bers e r k
a g a i n , despite the presence of 200 police offic e rs.
Once again, no news cove r a g e .
I mention these incidents to highlight a much
larger point. Hip-hop is a convenient scapegoat
because its communities don’t have the political
p ower or money to control the type of media images
projected wo r l d w i d e . This has resulted in unbal-
anced coverage and the maligning of a culture.
Another major issue to consider is the violent
i m a g e ry often promoted by the rappers themselve s.
A cottage industry has blossomed over the past ten
ye a rs as record companies and artists make a killing
by selling a “thugged out”, m i s o g y n i s t i c, g a n g s t a
i m a g e .There is no denying that some of these art i s t s
actually adopt the attitudes their songs and videos
p r o j e c t . H owe ve r , there are other ways of reading
these coded lyrics and images.To begin with, s o m e
r a p p e rs use the violent metaphors as part of a long
tradition of toasting or bragging about their musical
p r owe s s.As A f rican A m e rican author and professor
Robin D. G. Kelley points out, by exaggerating and
boasting about imagi n a ry criminal acts, r a p p e rs
engage in “ verbal duels over who is the ‘ b a d d e s t ’ .”
Kelley also shows how the narr at i ves operate on two
l e ve l s. I n s i d e rs can appreciate the irony of the duels
while outsiders—namely white middle-class kids—
are enthralled by a literal reading. Judgements aside,
gangsta rappers take this audience on a fantasy tour
of “the ghetto”—a forbidden zone of cop-killers and
w h o r e s. The rappers are simply playing up on the
appeal of the evil fa n t a s i e s.
N ow you may not approve of this panderi n g .B u t
r e m e m b e r , the artists are just a small cog in the
machine of the multi-billion-dollar (per year) music
bu s i n e s s.Radio stat i o n s ,D J s , video outlets,p r o m o t i o n
people and record labels must also shoulder the
b l a m e . These money-makers aren’t just cat e ring to
popular demand.They are cultivating the market.
Major radio stations are literally flooded with hun-
dreds of pieces of music eve ry day. Who is more
responsible for influencing the public: the radio stat i o n
with a million listeners or the artist that the stat i o n
chooses to play? If an artist like
Snoop Dog or Dr Dre (both
a s s o c i ated with violence) come
in for an interv i e w, the journ a l-
ist is not obliged to focus exclu-
s i vely on the negat i ve side of
their “ghetto upbri n gi n g s ” .
They could ask about positive
projects the artist might be pur-
s u i n g .Yet it’s more profitable to
p l ay up the negat i ve stereotypes
t h at people have of rappers and black people in gen-
e r a l . One could argue that the artist should challenge
the unbalanced questioning. But it’s crucial to realise
t h at the problem of violence is bigger then the art i s t .
The violence associated with hip-hop must be
seen in proper pers p e c t i ve .We can condemn the vio-
lent acts of certain individuals without maligning a
c u l t u r e .We can read between the lines of masculine
joustings via the microphone.We can also recognise
the mainstream cultural obsession with violence: j u s t
check out the ticket sales to Hollywo o d ’s gangster
films or TV progr a m m e s. In short , we have to recog-
nise the complexity of hip-hop. R a p p e rs offer more
than just a mirror of the violence in their own com-
munities—their work reflects that of society as a
w h o l e . In short , hip-hop will remain as violent as we
a l l ow it to be. It wo n ’t change until we do. ■

E x c e s s for all
◗ Micz Flor Young rebels are not only
attacking the music 
industry but also creating new
c i rcuits of solidarity via the
I n t e r n e t
The Internet has provided a playground for young
rebels to hit the music industry where it hurts:
stealing their intellectual property. Breaching
copyright laws has long been seen as good conduct.
Back in the 70s,punk record labels used slogans such
as “Home taping is killing the music industry, keep
up the good work.” However, the threat to estab-
lished publishing houses has always been limited, as
pirating on ordinary tapes made distribution techni-
cally complicated.Throughout the 70s and 80s some
independent mail ordering systems were set up, cre-
ating a network amongst pirate radio stations. But
they never hurt anyone.
To d ay, yo u n g, s u b ve rs i ve elements have the
Internet at their fingertips,and the cultural industries
on their knees. The audio format MP3 allows us to
compress audio CDs into small files which can be
made accessible on the Internet. Just click, download
and listen.All you need is a modem, a phone line and
a mediocre computer. Surely, having access to exact-
ly the same distribution channels as the multination-
als dissolves established power structures. And with-
out any financial pressure, no additional costs other
than the phone bill (mostly paid by parents), youth-
ful enthusiasm combined with a complete lack of
respect for legislative regulations opens the flood-
gates for piracy.
Of course,“young people on the Internet” are not
all about stealing intellectual property. In fact, the
real opportunity lies in becoming part of a global cul-
tural exchange—without depending on the old-fash-
ioned music industr y. Instead of producing and sell-
ing products, alternative models of work are taking
shape. For example, an originally anarcho-commu-
nist concept—the gift economy—is alive and well.
The philosophy is simple: trade what you have, and
who needs money anyway? Pilot FM, a Vienna-
based MP3 label, which has grown out of the
crossover between independent Internet Service
Providers and electronic sound artists, states on
its website: “Though we won’t charge you for the
downloads, we are thankful for donations of any
kind such as hardwa r e , s o f t wa r e , t r ave l l e r ’s
cheques, canned tomato soup, instant coffee or
any other device,which you think makes life more
pleasurable.”1
Sound artists have also learned from the
I n t e rn e t ’s Open Source deve l o p m e n t . In a nut-
s h e l l : the more beta-testers and deve l o p e rs wo r k i n g
on a product, the better it is.This has been prove n
time again with software deve l o p m e n t , which is fa r
too complicated for a single individual to manage.
Tu rning to the cultural fie l d , a rtists are rolling ove r
the old notion of copyri g h t . G i ve away your bu i l d-
ing blocks (ideas), see what others make of them
and this will help your own deve l o p m e n t . So we
find sample banks and archives for storing sound
and music files available all over the Intern e t . A n
avant-garde hip-hop musician with a taste for
squeaks may find the sound of her dreams in an
a r c h i ve . She may in turn transform that squeak
and so the bank gr ows richer… The archives also
enable net radios to enlarge their play l i s t s. One of
m a ny examples is the Budapest based DJ net.radio
s t ation Pa r a r a d i o2, running a tight schedule of DJs
and sound art i s t s. Daniel Molnar, one of the spir-
its behind the project, e x p l a i n s : “ We don’t eve n
need to rely on produced sample discs, we have on-
line sample stores and free archive s. (...) If you feel
r e a l , join the new folkat e e rs.”3
Liberating information
But the subversion goes beyond attacking the
music industry to the political sphere. With the
emergence of a digital equivalent to the public
s p h e r e , issues of civil disobedience and revo l u t i o n-
a ry spirit have shifted into the electronic netwo r k s.
Throughout the 1980s hackers took the symbolic
role of the militant opposition.“ I n f o rm ation wa n t s

to be free”, they claimed while pulling confid e n t i a l
files out in the open.4
To d ay the streets of Vienna offer a cogent example
of youth seizing the Internet to organise resistance.
Since the new right-wing gove rnment took powe r ,
youth groups like Volkstanz organised via the Intern e t
weekly street parades with live DJs throughout the
c a p i t a l , while toying with the gove rn m e n t ’s helpless
attempts to control them by proudly stating on their
we b s i t e : “All insults are we l c o m e : we are the hedo-
nistic Intern e t - g e n e r at i o n , t h e
dance floor wing of the resistance
m ove m e n t . (…) We want to fig h t
through the medium of political
street parties the terri t o ri a l i s at i o n
of youth culture.”5
B e l grade based Radio B 2-92
( f o rmerly B92) is another exam-
ple of subve rs i ve youth culture via
Internet. As they announce on
their virtual JukeBox :“By play i n g
music with a subtle but unmis-
takable political and social mes-
s a g e , Radio B92 confronted the
aesthetic that had been imposed
on the “silent majori t y ” , one that
failed to foster liberal attitudes in
the country during the disinte-
gration of former Yugoslavia.”6
With their on-air frequency under
constant threat of closure by the
g ove rn m e n t ,Free B92—the we b-
site—has become a meeting place,
d r awing audiences far beyond the
b o r d e rs of former Yu g o s l av i a .
From early on,radio aficionados were quick to
seize the cyberworld’s audio formats to link virtual
space with the streets. London based irational.org
is no exception.Besides the pirate radio handbook7,
they also feature the net.radio guide8 which has
been developed by va rious producers across
Europe. Here the clever youth can find technical
details on how to connect on-line broadcasting with
low-power FM transmitters.
But building bridges to the street via net radio
is just one line of attack. Media collectives across
Europe had spent the final ye a rs of the last century
l e a rning to transgress national borders via new
modes of shared broadcasting and artistic creat i o n .
The Berlin-based—and recently deceased—col-
lective convex tv. came to the conclusion: “There
are a few simple reasons for doing things collec-
tively: technologically and economically speaking
the collective is the only space where you can be
m a r ginally successful and successfully margi n a l .”9
The aim isn’t to reach a bigger or mass audi-
ence but rather to connect pockets of creat i v i t y
and resistance via new modes of shared broad-
c a s t i n g . In their avant-garde experi m e n t at i o n ,t e c h-
n o l o gical possibilities and artistic expression are
i n d i s t i n g u i s h a b l e . For example, in 1997 Riga’s
net.radio station Ozone1 0 set up a mailing list
( X c h a n g e1 1) to develop the concept of “ a c o u s t i c
s p a c e ”i nvolving techniques like co-streaming. A s
Raitis Smits, the stat i o n ’s director, has explained,
“Each broadcaster takes another’s live stream [of
s o u n d ] , re-encodes it and forwards it to the next
p a rt i c i p a n t .”1 2
Such transnational projects generate a new
mode of communication amongst young practi-
t i o n e rs. Not only is there a need to work collec-
t i vely within their own gr o u p, but they must also lat-
erally exchange know l e d g e , content and theory.
They share an acoustic space, ye t
they may never meet in “ r e a l
s p a c e .”And so they leave the old
artistic concepts of community-
based work behind and enter a
new digital env i r o n m e n t : the col-
lective is dead,long live the col-
lective.
H owe ve r , this digital netwo r k
cannot truly serve as a source for
d e m o c r atic part i c i p ation and free
speech without solid gr o u n d i n g
in the “access for all” p a r a d i g m .
O b v i o u s l y, access to the Intern e t
means more than a phone line, a
computer and technical know -
h ow. In terms of cultural produc-
t i o n ,“ a c c e s s ”g e n e r ates two prob-
lem zones. F i rs t , it is generally
assumed that the Internet allow s
m a r ginal groups to make their
voices heard, yet the question is
rarely raised as to who is speaking
on behalf of such gr o u p s.
S e c o n d , the idea of access for all is normally under-
stood as a one-way process, meaning eve ryone should
h ave access to all inform at i o n . But by reading this par-
adigm in reve rs e , all inform ation should be accessi-
ble to all. In the case of youth culture, danger ari s e s
as a more homogenised MTV youth style is increas-
ingly made available in standardised form ats on-line.
So despite the little islands of resistance to “ M c D o n-
a l d ’s - s t y l e ”culture nuggets,we might face yet another
p r o b l e m , not unknown in the We s t e rn wo r l d — c u l-
tural assimilat i o n . Is this the price to pay? Substitute
access with excess and you’ll hear that same old song
of homogenized culture. Re-wind or fa s t - f o r wa r d ?■

Should the economic embargo
imposed on Iraq a decade ago be
numbered among the crimes that have
made the 20th century one of the darkest in

make a fuss about some humanitarian dis-

◗ UNESCO Courier journalist
to the last question:“It would be easier to
mobilise public opinion behind this wo rt hy
cause if the Iraqi dictatorship was not one
of the world’s worst,” he says.
A recent resolution of the UN Human
Rights Commission, on 18 A p ril 2000,
“strongly condemns,” inter alia, “the sys-
tematic, widespread and extremely grave
v i o l ations of human ri g h t s ” in Iraq,
“resulting in an all-perva s i ve repression
and oppression.” It also condemns the
“ s u m m a ry and arbitrary exe c u t i o n s ,
including political killings,” and “ w i d e-
spread,systematic torture.”
The subject of the Iraqi embargo may be
a trap, just as the Iraqi people are trapped.
To talk about it might be to play into the
hands of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s
r e gi m e .To keep quiet might be tantamount
to failure to help a people in distress.
But the wall of silence is starting to
crack after reports from UN bodies that
the sanctions may have killed more than

the purchases, can block some items
(ranging from lead pencils to chlorine to
vaccines) if it thinks they could be used to
make weapons of mass destru c t i o n .M e a n-
w h i l e , a UN special commission, UN S C O M,
was sent to Iraq to monitor the disarma-
ment process.
When the commission was disbanded at
the end of 1998, all of Iraq’s nuclear, c h e m-
ical and biological weapons progr a m m e s
had been dismantled or destroyed and the
threat from them reduced to “zero, none,”
said the A m e rican former chief of the
UN S C O M inspection team, Scott Ritter, in a
recent BBC documentary which attacked
those responsible for maintaining the
embargo.2
But the UN Security Council set up a
new arms control commission in its reso-
lution 1284 of 17 December 1999. “The
aim is to check that nothing nuclear has
been rebuilt and to see what the situation is
c o n c e rning chemical and biologi c a l
we a p o n s ,” s ays the French foreign min-
i s t ry.“After that we can move towards lifting
sanctions if Iraq co-operates.”
France, along with China and Russia,
n e ve rtheless abstained in the vote to approve
resolution 1284, s aying the wording did
not describe “in completely good fa i t h ”t h e
procedure for suspending the embargo.T h e
Iraqi regime is refusing to co-operate.
So the people of Iraq are still hostages.
“ W h at was an acceptable situation in 1991
no longer is,” s ays Germ a ny ’s Hans vo n
Sponeck, the latest UN humanitarian co-
ordinator in Iraq to have resigned his post,
in March 2000.The embargo, decided upon
in full compliance with the UN Charter,is
n ow “a clear violation of human ri g h t s ,”
he says. Even worse, states former French
foreign minister Claude Cheysson, it is a
c rime against humanity,“as defined by the
UN itself”3 (see box).
In the United States some people agr e e ,
including former A t t o rney-General Ramsey
Clark and Francis Boy l e , professor of inter-
n ational law at the Unive rsity of Illinois.Vo n
S p o n e c k ’s predecessor, I rishman Denis Hal-
l i d ay, who resigned in September 1998, h a s
also joined the opponents of the embargo.
“ I ’ ve been using the term ‘ g e n o c i d e ,’ b e c a u s e
this is a deliberate policy to destroy the people
of Iraq,”he recently stat e d .Some legal expert s
are sceptical about or even against using such
t e rm i n o l o g y.“ People who talk like that don’t
k n ow anything about law,” r e t o rts Mari o
B e t t at i ,who invented the notion of “the ri g h t
of humanitarian interve n t i o n ” .“The embargo
has certainly affected the Iraqi people badly,
but that ’s not at all a crime against humanity
or genocide.”
FIDH secretary-general Bourdon says
“one of the key elements of a crime against
humanity and of genocide is intent. T h e
embargo wa s n ’t imposed because the
United States and Britain wanted children
to die. If you think so, you have to prove it.”
But what about today, when the whole
world knows Iraqi children are dying
because of the sanctions?
“ L e aving in place a measure which yo u
k n ow is killing people isn’t the same as
applying measures deliberately calculated
and planned to cause the maximum number
of people to die,” he says.
Pat rick Baudouin, F I D H ’s president,
is less sure. He says he “ h e s i t at e s ” to call the
embargo a crime against humanity. “As a

DEFINI T IONS
● The Statute of the International Criminal
Court defines “crimes against humanity” as acts
“committed as part of a widespread or systematic
attack directed against any civilian population,
with knowledge of the attack,” including “inhu-
mane acts . . . intentionally causing great suffer-
ing, or serious injury to body or to mental or
physical health.”
● Genocide includes acts “committed with
intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,
e t h n i cal, racial or religious group,” including
“causing serious bodily or mental harm to
members of the group” and “d e l i b e rately infli c t-
ing on the group conditions of life calculated to
bring about its physical destruction in whole or
inpart.” ■
extension does raise serious questions.” A l l
these law ye rs agr e e , h owe ve r , t h at the
embargo violates basic human ri g h t s ,
starting with the right to life.
There is also a lot of argument about
who is responsible for the humanitari a n
disaster in Iraq. The U. S . S t ate Depart-
ment, which does not even accept UNICEF
and WH O f i g u r e s , puts the blame on
Saddam Hussein. Samuel Berger, of the
U. S . N ational Security Council, said in
May 2000 that “by obstructing UN relief,
refusing to order nutritional supplements,
e ven selling food and medicine to bu i l d
p a l a c e s , M r. Saddam has aggr avated his
p e o p l e ’s suffering and used the spectacle to
seek the removal of sanctions.”
Von Sponeck spends most of his time
r e butting these arguments.“The UN pub-
lishes a monthly stock report that show s
w h at has arri ved in Iraq, w h at has been
distributed, what is stored away and why.
The picture that emerges for food is perfect.
(...) Tr a n s p o rt is a problem, but people are
receiving their food baskets every month
and warehouses are empty the day after
distribution,” he says.
When Washington accuses Baghdad of
not distri buting about a quarter of the med-
ical supplies, he notes that “W H O r e c o m-
mends that a country should have 25 per cent
of its drugs in stock to prepare and be pre-
pared for an epidemic. Iraq said it could not
afford this, but keeps 15 per cent in stock.
The drugs all undergo quality control tests,
which 5.8 per cent of them have fa i l e d .T h e n
you have medical components that are unus-
able because they can only be used in com-
b i n ation with others.” H a l l i d ay points out that
the sanctions committee “ would deliber-
ately approve nine [items] but block the
t e n t h , k n owing full well that without the
tenth item, the other nine were of no use . . .
I t ’s a deliberate ploy.”
Reforming the UN Charter
Unease over the Iraqi embargo has
reopened debate about the use of embar-
goes as a we a p o n . A rticle 41 of the UN
C h a rter says the Security Council can
enforce its decisions by applying measures
t h at include “the complete or partial inter-
ruption of economic relations and of . . .
means of communication.”
This trend has increased in recent ye a rs.
Since 1990, the United Nations has
imposed sanctions on Yu g o s l av i a ,S o m a l i a ,
S i e rra Leone, L i b ya ,L i b e ri a ,H a i t i ,A n g o l a ’s
Unita rebels and Iraq.
S u p p o rt e rs of sanctions say it is often the
only way to punish countries that threaten
p e a c e . They cost little at a time when
We s t e rn public opinion frowns on the huge
expense and loss of human life involved in
m i l i t a ry interve n t i o n s. The opponents of
sanctions stress the serious effects on the
civilian population while the targeted
r e gimes become more entrenched and
manage to smuggle in supplies regardless.
The Iraqi example confirms their argu-
m e n t .The people have been bled dry.T h e r e
is abundant proof that the ruling clique is
becoming wealthier and that oil is being
smuggled out. At the end of Ja n u a ry 2000,
the British House of Commons issued a
r e p o rt admitting the embargo had failed and
expressing the hope that no other country
would ever be submitted to such an ordeal.
“Nearly all embargoes penalize civil-
ians and boost the power of the political
l e a d e rs they aim to bring dow n ,” s ay s
B o u r d o n , who neve rtheless adds that “ o n e
can perhaps say that developments in South
A f rica were the result of intern ational sanc-
tions against apartheid.”
Along with others , he points to the
e x c e s s i ve weight of the United Stat e s ,
backed by its British ally, in Securi t y
Council decisions. He thinks the UN
C h a rter should be amended and UN deci-
sion-making procedures changed. In par-
ticular, victims of human rights violations
should be represented by a consultat i ve
committee attached to the Security Council.
“ I t ’s unacceptable that the future of a whole
people should be in the hands of two stat e s ,”
he says. “We can no longer allow states to
pursue cynically their regional or interna-
tional interests,as is the case in Iraq.”
Many analysts,including Halliday and
von Sponeck, think the embargo is being
prolonged so as to maintain the status quo
in the Middle East.According to them, its
protagonists are in favour of a weak Iraq,
without necessarily getting rid of a regime
that prevents the country splitting apart.
These analysts say the break-up of Iraq,
with a Kurdish gove rnment in the nort h
and a Shiite authority in the south, could
destabilize a region that provides the bulk of
the oil needed by the major world powers
and would threaten key U.S.allies such as
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Further-
m o r e , s ays Halliday, maintaining tension
in the region has enabled U.S. arms man-
ufacturers to sell about $100 billion worth
of weaponry to Baghdad’s enemies.
But with the We s t e rn media increas-
ingly outraged at the embargo and three
m e m b e rs of the UN Security Council
( F r a n c e , Russia and China) openly against
continuing it, von Sponeck sees a glimmer
of hope. “I don’t think the sanctions will be
extended far into 2001,” he say s , “ bu t
think of all the children who’ll die in the
m e a n t i m e .”

Adopting children is legal, unlike in
other Muslim countries, but is not very
common, says Jabir Aboud Hamid, who
runs the centre. He sees only two ways of
getting the children back into society:
“Find the boys’ families and arrange mar-
riages for the girls.”The latter risk death if
they return home after living in “run-
down places” (the street). “But before I
start looking for something for them,”
says Hamid, “I’ve got to find a new bat-
tery for the centre’s car so I can go and
buy bread for the children.”
In Iraq today, e ve ry sector has urgent
n e e d s , s ays a UN I C E F o f ficial in Baghdad:
“ We ’re doing the work the gove rn m e n t
c a n ’t do any longer because of the embargo,
like building clinics, houses and schools,
r e p a i ring drains, water treatment plants,
p rinting presses and chalk fa c t o ri e s. I t ’s an
e n o rmous job and we have to work fast to
s ave the children. Most of all, we ’ ve got to
get them back into school so this ‘ e m b a r g o
g e n e r at i o n ’ i s n ’t lost to the country.”
O ver the past 10 ye a rs , the gove rn-
m e n t ’s education budget has shrunk by 90
per cent, from $230 million in 1991 to $23
million today. As many as 83 per cent of
p ri m a ry schools need to be repaired. S o m e
h ave been totally destroye d , while others
are working at “full capacity”. At Diala
s c h o o l , on the road between Baghdad and
B a s r a , the pupils take turns learning in
four-hour shifts in classrooms with broken
benches and desks, bare electrical wiri n g,
ceilings with holes and flo o rs under wat e r.
Despair reigns in the public health
department. “They say Iraq makes arms
using anti-cancer medicine and chlorine
needed for water purification,” exclaims
Abdul Amir El Thamery. “Do we have to
stand and watch people die? Must chil-
dren fall ill because the water is undrink-
able? And what’s going to happen in the
summer heat when illness,death and mal-
nutrition are already so common?” ■

is drawing in and the traders are starting to
pull down the metal screens in front of
their shops. The smiling yo u n g s t e rs , l e s s
than eight ye a rs old, are trying to sell to
p a s s e rsby their sole possessions—a couple
of red and white striped plastic bags. “ We
wo n ’t quit the street until we ’ ve earn e d
some money,” they say, as we are joined by
40-odd other street children who have no
wares left to sell.
They all talk at once.They left school,
they say, because they failed their studies.
They don’t live at home because their
parents are “divorced or out of work”and
“they have to live on their wits”. As the
last shopkeepers switch off their electrici-
ty generators, the street darkens. The
youngest of the group, a boy hardly six
ye a rs old, steps forward and says he
“wants to go to school”.
How long will it be before the world
realises the dramatic effects the interna-
tional embargo is having on the people of
Iraq and especially on their children? Iraq
and the Iraqis have been ruined by two
wars1, but damaged even more by the
international sanctions imposed nearly a
decade ago after Iraqi ruler Saddam
Hussein’s troops invaded Kuwait.
Every month, malnutrition kills more
than 4,500 Iraqi children under five ,
according to estimates of a UNICEF survey
released in August 1999.How many more
deaths must there be before people realise
what is going on? There were hardly any
street children a decade ago, when all
youngsters went to school. Today their
numbers are growing. In Iraq, it is illegal
to work or beg under the age of 15, and
street kids are punished for committing
these offences. When they are arrested,
they are usually sent to detention centres
where conditions are very harsh. Some
then manage to get to El Rahma
( “ M e r cy ” ) , B a g h d a d ’s only reception
centre for street children, where condi-
tions are better but carers are few.2

“Pollution has managed to do what
350 years of wars, invasions and nat-
ural disasters have failed to do. It has
begun to mar the magnificent walls of the
Taj Mahal,” declared U.S. President Bill
Clinton during his visit to the 17th-centu-
ry monument in the city of Agra earlier
this year.
O ver the past two decades, the fate of
the country ’s foremost tourist at t r a c t i o n
has repeatedly come into the spotlight.
Time and time again, e x p e rts have wa rn e d
t h at environmental pollution is eat i n g
away at the monument and discolouri n g
its once translucent white marble. But the
p r e s c ription—to control pollution by relo-
c ating a number of industries around the
Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ), a 10,400 sq.
km area around the monument—is pitting
c o n s e rvationists and env i r o n m e n t a l i s t s
against business interests and unions.
Besides the Taj Mahal, the zone includes
t wo other world heritage monuments, t h e
A gra Fo rt and Fatehpur Sikri . So what
should take precedence—the monument
or the thousands of wo r k e rs employed by
the fa c t o ries in the area? The stakes are
such that the case is being fought out in
the country ’s Supreme Court .
The culprits include the Mat h u r a
R e fin e ry, iron foundri e s , glass fa c t o ri e s
and brick kilns, not to mention the con-
tinuous flow of traffic along the highway s
s k i rting the city. On repeated occasions,
sulphur dioxide emissions from industri e s
in the area have reached levels ten times
a b ove the prescribed standard leve l .C o m-
bined with oxygen and moisture, s u l p h u r
d i oxide settles on the surface of the tomb
and corrodes the marble, f o rming a
fungus that experts refer to as “ m a r b l e

Blaming pollution and regulat o ry neg-
ligence for the Ta j ’s decay, M a h e s h
Chandra Mehta, a prominent env i r o n m e n-
tal law ye r , filed a case before the Supreme
C o u rt of India in 1984. He pointed out
t h at the white marble had blackened in
p l a c e s , while inside, the monument wa s
being eaten by fungus, especially in the
inner chamber, where the ori ginal gr ave s
of Emperor Shah Jahan and his belove d
wife Mumtaz Mahal lie. Mehta pleaded
with the court to order the va rious indus-
t ries to take anti-pollution measures or to
c l o s e . He also stressed that pollution wa s
affecting the health of wo r k e rs and people
living in A gr a ’s residential areas.
Switch to gas
It was not until 1996 that the
Supreme Court finally ruled that the
industries in the area were actively con-
tributing to air pollution and ordered
major industrial units to install pollution
control devices. “Not even a one per cent
chance can be taken when—human life
apart—the preservation of a prestigious
monument like the Taj is involved,” stated
the court order. The court ordered 292
coal-based industries to switch to natural
gas or else to relocate outside the protect-
ed zone by April 30, 1997. Coke, the fuel
commonly used in the cupola furnaces in
foundries,is known to cause high levels of
air pollution. Factories that opted for
relocation would be obliged to re-employ
workers under favourable terms and to
give them a one-year bonus. And if their
plant were to close down, workers would
be entitled to six years’ worth of wages in
compensation.
As a result, the oil refin e ry and a num-
ber of A gr a ’s foundries installed expensive
pollution control devices. Sterling Machine
Tools (SMT), the biggest fa c t o ry in A gr a ,
obtained a gas connection from the Gas
A u t h o rity of India. But according to a
senior personnel manager, it takes time for
production to reach the same levels as
before and for wo r k e rs to adjust to the new
t e c h n o l o g y. “The gas furnace costs around
Rs50 lakhs ($120,000). While we have the
m o n e y, small units do not,” he said.
Quite a number of factories did noth-
ing about relocating or switching to nat-
ural gas. Some claimed that the cost of
these operations was prohibitive: accord-
ing to one industry representative, the
basic equipment runs between Rs30 to
Rs40 lakhs ($75,000 and $100,000),
almost a quarter of annual sales for a
medium-sized company. Smaller firm s
say that the cost of applying for a gas con-
nection, which includes  a pre-payment,
cuts into annual sales. Even if they did
close down and sell their land, factory
owners claim that this would not cover
workers’ compensation. Foundry owners
also claimed that finding skilled or even
semi-skilled replacements for specific
tasks in the relocated areas would be
difficult.
Delay tactics
In August 1999, the Supreme Court
struck again, ordering the closure of 53
iron foundries and 107 other factories in
Agra that had not cleaned up their act.
The order has become a call to arms for
f o u n d ry ow n e rs , wo r k e rs , trade union
representatives and small-scale industry.
However, industry is buying time: it filed
a review petition through the Uttar
Pradesh State government and obtained a
reprieve on the court order’s implementa-
tion.The matter comes again before the
Supreme Court this summer.
In the meantime, A gr a ’s Iron
Founders’ Association are building up
their case.They argue that 3,000 cottage
and engi n e e ring units depend on the
foundries, and that about 300,000 work-
ers are directly or indirectly employed by
them. They hold that the technology for
using natural gas in their industries is
not yet ready. Mehta claims that this is
a “ d e l aying tactic”: in 1995, i n d u s t ry
experts had said that gas could be used as
industrial fuel. “If the technology was not
available then, they should have stated so
at the time.” According to Mehta, the
required technology has been developed
by the National Metallurgical Laboratory
and would help turn the hundreds of
foundries in Agra into more efficient and
less polluting units. While Mehta contin-
ues with his legal bat t l e , his cru s a d e
against industrial pollution earned him
the 1996 Goldman Environmental Prize
and the Ramon Magsaysay Award for
Public Service in 1997.
Although union leaders are firmly
opposed to any relocation or factory clo-
sures, the battle has brought other con-
cerns to the fore. According to a leader
from the Centre for Indian Tr a d e
MONUMENT 
TO ET ERNAL LO V E
The Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor
Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz
Mahal. Built entirely in white marble, the Taj was
constructed over a period of 22 years and was
completed in 16 47 A.D. It is situated in northern
India on the southern bank of the Yamuna river
in Agra, about 210 km from the capital, New
Delhi. The mausoleum complex is hailed as the
finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend-
ing of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. The Ta j
was designated as a UNES CO World Heritage site
in 19 8 3 .

HIS TORIC LIMA 
GETS A NEW HE A RT
◗ Luis Jaime Cisneros
Although not a metropolis every urban planner would dream of, Lima no longer has the
dubious title of one of Latin America’s dirtiest and most polluted cities
◗ Lima-based freelance journalist
■
Nobody who strolled through the centre
of Lima in the 1980s could have imag-
ined that some day the Pe ruvian capital
would be called a “garden city”. Air and noise
p o l l u t i o n , lack of public services (public toi-
l e t s , proper lighting), t r a f fic chaos,va n d a l i s m
and the invasion of the city centre by thou-
sands of street ve n d o rs drove out not only
t o u rists and pri vate businesses but local res-
idents who only ventured there to go to wo r k .
In June 1989, a group of urban planners ,
architects,historians,artists and art critics
decided to set up the Lima Foundation, a
p ri vat e ,n o n - p o l i t i c a l ,n o n - p r o fit organiza-
tion to save the old city centre. “ We all had
jobs in the historic centre and could see
h ow it was really going dow n h i l l ,” s ays jour-
nalist Augusto Elmore.
The Fo u n d at i o n ’s first victory was get-
ting the city centre onto UNESCO’s World
H e ritage List in 1991.This enthused public
opinion and spurred the city authorities to
embark on a far-reaching renovation pro-
gramme in the mid-1990s with the Foun-
d at i o n ’s help and support . “ H i s t o ric city
centres are places where culture, tourism
and economics can rub shoulders , and their
r e s t o r ation must benefit all social classes and
foster a spirit of unity,” s ays urban sociolo-
gist Gladys Chavez.
Those in charge of the programme took
this to heart and reckoned that revamping
the centre would have a beneficial effect
on the rest of the city, which is home to eight
million people (a quarter of the country’s
p o p u l at i o n ) . They focused on renovat i n g
116 blocks cove ring 123 hectares and
including 570 monuments—baroque
c h u r c h e s , Renaissance mansions, u n i ve r-
sities and conve n t s , all of them examples of
Spanish urban colonial architecture.
The programme borrowed ideas from
earlier plans to restore Hava n a , M e x i c o
City and Quito—all of whose historic cen-
tres are World Heritage sites—and was a
joint effort by local authori t i e s , civil society
and the pri vate sector. “The Fo u n d at i o n
drafted renovation projects and passed them
on to gove rnment bodies—the city author-
i t i e s , the National Cultural Institute and
the urban investment fund—for exe c u t i o n ,”
s ays Juan Günther, the 63-year-old architect
in charge of the Foundation’s projects.
Traffic control
One of the first measures taken was to
reorganise street trading. “ To get to the
Plaza José de San Martin square, in the
c e n t r e , p e d e s t rians and motorists had to
we ave their way through thousands of ve n-
dors,who either had stalls or laid out their
wares and their knick-knacks on the pave-
ment and in the road,” s ays Elmore.To d ay,
you can get through the streets more easily,
because only officially licensed street ven-
dors are allowed into the centre and many
of the others have been moved into shop-
ping galleries outside the old city centre.
Another pri o rity was tackling air and
noise pollution. “ A nyone who works in the
Unions, the entire foundry industry is
highly exploitative and the working con-
ditions hazardous.The majority of work-
ers are employed on a contract basis
despite having worked for long periods
in the foundries—which means they
would receive no protection if factories
were to close. And a lack of information
appears to hang over the whole saga:
Ram Sharan, a worker in his mid-thirties
from Bihar, said that he had vaguely
heard about foundries relocating and
was quite certain that he would lose
his job as a result. Workers at GT Iron
Industries, a casting unit slated for clo-
sure, said that they had heard about the
court order but didn’t know where they
would go if the unit closed down. They
had left their villages in Uttar Pradesh
and other provinces many years ago and
were living in rented accommodation in
the city. But despite these conditions,
workers state that it is better than being
jobless.
Industries  aside, the Taj Mahal is an
economic asset in and of itself: two mil-
lion tourists visit the Taj every year, mak-
ing it a major source of revenue and for-
eign exchange for the region. It keeps
hotels, craftsmen and small businesses
thriving. In May this year, the Supreme
Court banned cars and parking within
500 metres of the Taj’s boundary walls. It
ordered the shifting of about 70 shops
from the precincts of the white marble
m a u s o l e u m . While experts agree that
some of these measures have helped to
improve air around the Taj, pollution lev-
els have not dropped to safer limits as
none of the factories have actually been
closed down.
Air pollution, dust, lack of greenery,
traffic and the presence of noisy diesel
generators around Agra are all harming a
prized tourist attraction. To date, politi-
cians have tended to side with industry
while the judiciary has backed the cause
of the Taj. But in the meantime, the mon-
ument to eternal love continues to
breathe in the fumes. ■
“Marble cancer” caused by sulphur dioxide is
yellowing the Taj’s once translucent surface.

centre suffers from it eve ry day,” s ays Gün-
ther. “It gives me a sore throat and a lot of
my colleagues get skin rashes.” So the traffic
system in the centre was changed to limit
the number of buses and taxis, which are
now regulated and painted yellow.
Restoration of the main public spaces,
such as the Plaza Mayor, began in 1997,
along with the renovation of churches, m o n-
uments and San Marcos Unive rs i t y,
founded in 1551 and the oldest in Latin
A m e ri c a . “But it was more than just restora-
tion.These places got used for new pur-
poses,” says Chavez. He cites the example
of the Lima Biennial A rt Fe s t i va l , w h i c h
holds exhibitions in large ari s t o c r atic man-
s i o n s , as well as schemes to encourage local
t o u rism such as the “ R e t u rn to the Centre”
campaign and the renovation of the Chinese
quarter.
Much of the work was carried out with
technical and financial assistance from
UN E S C O and foreign gove rn m e n t s , such as
Spain, or with the help of Cuba. But the
Fo u n d ation also lobbied the pri vate sector,
and va rious banks and big firm s , such as the
S o u t h e rn mining company, the Backus and
Johnson brewery, Telefonica de Peru and
Coca Cola, all of which gave money for the
r e n ovation wo r k . An “Adopt a Balcony ”
campaign to restore 300 colonial balconies
in the centre (at a cost of about $5,000
each) was funded by private firms.
Suggestions for
fighting poverty
In the past few ye a rs , Lima residents
of all classes, especially young people, h ave
begun to return to the centre. “We enjoy
coming here now because it’s like being in
a city within a city,” say Jimena and Kike,
two students crossing the Plaza Mayor.
Günther says the impression of neglect
and alienation people used to feel when
t h e y walked through the city centre is a
t h i n g of the past, but he fears the changes
might not stick. Air and noise pollution
h ave not gone away. “ A b a n c ay Ave n u e ,o n e
o f the main thoroughfa r e s , is a nightmare,w i t h
four times the maximum level of pollution
s e t by the World Health Organizat i o n ,” h e
s ay s.
But the big problem, he continues, i s
“social pollution” caused by petty crime in the
central area and the spread of poor housing,
along with insanitary conditions and high
i n fant mort a l i t y.The challenge for the next
few ye a rs will be to draw this sector of the
p o p u l ation back into society and into jobs.
Old mansions classified as histori c a l
monuments are occupied by between five
and sometimes a dozen families who pay
little or no rent. But the centre is not very
densely populated because of the large
number of official buildings,churches and
public spaces. The Fo u n d ation has sug-
gested conve rting disused buildings into
a p a rtments and knocking down those in
ve ry bad condition to replace them with
about 90,000 new apartments.
M oving more people into the old part of
the city and improving living conditions
there will also improve the quality of busi-
nesses and make the centre more at t r a c t i ve
for Lima’s citizens and for tourists. “The
first and most urgent task for Lima,” says
G ü n t h e r , “is the economic, c o m m e r c i a l
and cultural revival of the old city.” ■
The “Adopt a Balcony” campaign funded by private firms has led to the restoration of 300 colonial balconies in Lima’s historic centre.

missing phone rings—in the pocket of the
policeman who was helping to look for it.”
Mobiles are popular because of the
d e a rth of fixed telephone lines in A f ri c a .I n
1998, Europe had 37 lines for every 100
people while A f rica only had two. T h e
D e m o c r atic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
has one for every 2,500 people while Mali
and Niger have fewer than two per 1,000. I n
A s i a , the average is 7.34 lines for eve ry 100
people, more than double the number in
L atin A m e rican countries like Cuba (3.21)
and Nicaragua (3.13).
Mobile phones have started to fill this
c o m m u n i c ations gap.Although 80 per cent
of them are currently found in ri c h
c o u n t ri e s , in the 1990s the number of
subscribers in poor countries grew faster
than anywhere else. A f rica had almost
3 . 5 million mobile phone subscri b e rs in
1998.More than 70 per cent of them were
in South A f ri c a , where gr owth in this sector
exceeded all expectat i o n s , according to the
I n t e rn ational Te l e c o m m u n i c ation Union
(ITU).In the same year, 17 per cent of all
phone subscribers in Africa had mobiles.
The figure for Asia was 30 per cent. I n
developing countries like the Philippines,
B o l i v i a , Azerbaijan and Estonia, m o b i l e s
h ave caught on much quicker than
expected.
“The less infrastructure a country has,
the more attractive it is to invest in mobile
phones,” says Nagib Callaos, who teaches
at Simon Bolivar Unive rsity in Caracas.
“ T h e r e ’s no need to create a demand; i t
exists already. In Venezuela, for example,
there’s no traditional phone infrastructure
and mobile phones have spread much more
quickly than in the United States.”
Fo rty million people in the world are on
waiting lists for a fixed-line telephone,
according to the ITU. In Venezuela,where
the wait is nearly five ye a rs , a lucrat i ve black
market has set in, with people paying the
equivalent of 10 times the minimum wage
to get a line. N ow it is possible to sign a con-
tract for a mobile phone and start using it
the following day.
This delights some Ve n e z u e l a n s ,“ w h o
use the time when they’re stuck in Caracas’
endless traffic jams to catch up on the
phone calls they’ve been meaning to
m a k e ,” s ays Callaos. H aving a mobile
phone is also useful from the point of view
of safety. “My daughter never goes out at
night without her mobile. I can call her
e ve ry hour or less to see if she’s OK,”
h e s ay s.
Exponential growth
in war-torn countries
A mobile phone network can be up and
running much more quickly than a fixed
o n e . In Romania, the firm Mobifon
launched its service in 1996,just four and
a half months after being granted a licence
to operate. Since there is no need to dig
trenches for cables, i n s t a l l ation costs less and
the investment is recuperated more rapidly.
In Venezuela, profits began to roll in only
three years after startup.
Mobile phones are also ideal for coun-
tries whose infrastructure is inadequate or
has been seriously damaged by wa r. E x a m-
ples include Lebanon and especially Cam-
b o d i a , where there are more mobile cel-
lular subscri b e rs than fixed telephones.T h e

Groups of small farmers in remote
areas of Côte d’Ivoire share mobile
telephones so they can follow hourly
fluctuations in coffee and cocoa prices.
This means they can choose the moment
to sell their crops when world prices are
most advantageous to them. A few years
ago, they could only have found out about
market trends by applying to an office in
the capital, Abidjan. Their deal-making
was based on information from buyers,
and this was not always reliable.
These coffee and cocoa gr owe rs are just
a few of the economic playe rs in poor coun-
tries who are today making shrewd use of
the mobile phones,one of the star features
of the information society.
“Communication is a universal need,
but communications technology can be
used in a va riety of way s ,” s ays UN E S C O
c o m m u n i c ations specialist Babacar Fa l l .
“Although a mobile phone may nominally
belong to a single person, in some African
c o u n t ries it is regarded as the property of the
community, because there is a culture of
sharing the tools of communication.”
A dearth
of fixed lines
Fall cites the case of Senegalese living in
Dakar or abroad who have bought their
relatives a mobile phone to stay in touch.
S o m e t i m e s ,s e veral families living in places
where the dream of getting a fixed phone
line is unlikely to come true for at least 20
ye a rs share a mobile handset that they

be calling back in a few minutes from New
York or Rome.

In Kosovo, where the war partially destroyed communication infrastructures, an Albanian woman calls her son in Germany on a cell phone.
only other country where the situation is
comparable is Finland.
The ITU says the percentage of mobile
ve rsus fixed lines is proof of the vigour of the
mobile phone industry in countries of the
S o u t h . In Cambodia, mobile phones
appeared in 1992. Within a year mobile
subscribers exceeded the number of fixed
telephones and today, they constitute 72
per cent of all subscribers.The authorities
have even questioned the need to expand
the fixed network.
Fierce competition
between operators
Mobile phones will soon ove rtake fixe d
lines in Lebanon (now 45 per cent mobiles)
and Paraguay (43 per cent). In the latter,
mobile phone firm s , mostly pri vate and
backed by foreign investment, have bene-
fited from the ineffic i e n cy of the stat e -
owned fixed-line operat o r. (Unlike most of
its neighbours , Pa r a g u ay did not pri vatise its
t e l e c o m m u n i c ation operator in the 1990s. )
M a ny users choose to take advantage of
the ri va l ry between the four pri vate mobile
phone firms rather than remaining depen-
dent on the bureaucratic state company.
“The state has done poorly where fixe d
lines are concern e d ,” s ays the ITU’s Michael
M i n g e s. “Its role should be to open up the
market and create an open environment for
foreign inve s t m e n t .” B u t , he say s , the stat e
still has an important role as a regulat o r ,“ t o
fa c i l i t ate competition, to see that prices are
fair and to establish interconnections
b e t ween different systems, i n c l u d i n g
b e t ween mobile and fixed lines.”
In the beginning, it was thought that
mobile phones in poor countries wo u l d
only be used by the wealthy, and govern-
ments granted only one national mobile
phone operating licence. But almost half the
c o u n t ries with mobile phones now have
issued at least two licences, and the fierce
competition between operat o rs has helped
to reduce rat e s. This does not howe ve r
explain the current gr owth of a mass
m a r k e t , which is largely due to prepaid call
schemes.
The boom
in prepaid cards
The standard way of paying for a mobile
phone service is on the basis of a minimum
use of, say, two hours a month for a year.
Potential customers have to provide proof
of a regular income, sign a contract and
h ave a bank account and a perm a n e n t
address. But because the vast majority of
rural people in developing countries do not
have any of these, operators are using the
prepayment system.
This involves buying cards which pro-
vide phone time from five minutes to an
h o u r. C u s t o m e rs can use the credit as they
like over a period of we e k s , and so keep
control over their spending and enjoy a
ve ry cheap phone serv i c e . Prepaid cards
are widely available in local stores.
The potential market is huge.In 1998,
three ye a rs after the first prepaid mobile
phone scheme was launched, 40 million
people had opted for it—about 13 per cent
of the wo r l d ’s mobile users. In South A f ri c a ,
half of all subscribers chose prepayment,
and more than half in Mexico. In Senegal in
1 9 9 9 , one operator for the first time offered
a prepaid system as the only option.
After two months, the firm had wo n
In 1998, t h ree years after
the first prepaid mobile
phone scheme was

1 3 per cent of the world’s

according to a study by the Strat e gis Group,

The prepaid system, which has been
called the “perfect marri a g e ”b e t ween tech-

A micro-credit programme set up by Grameen Bank enables rural villagers to acquire cell
phones. For many, it  means a break with poverty and isolation
But the cost of these calls is still too
high for poor people to benefit from this
technology. The mobile phone faces a big
challenge if it is to help the poor break out
of their isolation and to contribute to “the
social and economic development of peo-
p l e s ” t h at the first A f rican Deve l o p m e n t
Forum called for in Addis Ababa last year.
State initiatives
These are not empty wo r d s. T h e
Grameen Bank project in Bangladesh has
shown that it is possible to give very poor
rural people access to mobile phones (see
next article).Nevertheless,“many govern-
ments still regard mobile phones as a luxury
and won’t accept that they offer the best
opportunity of bringing modern commu-
n i c ations to the least developed areas,”
s ay s Michael Stocks, e x - c h a i rman of the
Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions (GSM) Association.
The role of the state is vital, not just to
ensure competition between mobile phone
operators but also to encourage ambitious
p r o j e c t s.The ITU suggests that , just as they
subsidise water and electri c i t y, g ove rn m e n t s
could help the poorest people to have access
to mobile phones or distri bute free prepaid
mobile phone cards on a massive scale.
Such steps would give a big boost to a rev-
olution that has so far been the privy of
those with money in pocket. ■

Once, it was hard for Fatema Begum
and her day-labourer husband to
provide three meals a day for their
family, who lived in a thatched hut in
a remote village called Pa rulia in
Bangladesh’s Narshingdi district. But a
mobile phone she bought as a means of
earning money for her impoverished fam-
ily has changed her life. In a couple of
years, she managed to acquire a brick-
built house with electricity, an electric
fan, a black and white television set and
several other modern amenities. Mobile
phones have not only improved the lives
of villagers like Fatema, but also brought
remote villages like Parulia out of isola-
tion.
“Since my phone is the only one within
three kilometres, m a ny people come here to
use it,” Fatema say s. She earns about 5,000
takas (US$100) a month from her mobile
p h o n e , after meeting all the costs—four
times the average per capita monthly
i n c o m e . Fatema adds,“ People in my village
who have relat i ves abroad often gi ve me
gifts in addition to payment of their bills
because I bring the phone to their houses
when there are incoming calls for them.”
Mobile phones make up for a lack of ser-
vices that the Stat e - owned phone company
is hard-pressed to prov i d e . According to
c u rrent stat i s t i c s ,Bangladesh has one phone
for every 380 inhabitants, compared with
one for every 50 in neighbouring India.
Fatema started her struggle for a better
life ten ye a rs ago when she joined Grameen
Bank,an internationally acclaimed micro-
credit institution, to obtain a small, short-
t e rm loan of 2,000 takas ($40). She start e d
a small business hawking va rious essen-
t i a l s , including ri c e , door to door in vil-
lages. When Fatema repaid that loan, she
was granted another one of 5,000 takas
( $ 1 0 0 ) , which she also promptly paid back.
In 1997, Grameen Te l e c o m , a unit of
Grameen Trust, one of the world’s largest
organizations working for poverty allevia-
t i o n , introduced village phones for Grameen
Bank members. Soon after, Fatema wa s
a l l owed to purchase a phone at a cost
o f 19,500 takas ($390), r e i m bu rs i n g
4 0 0 takas ($8) eve ry week in regular instal-

“Without mobile phones, violence would
have been rampant in Senegal during
the presidential election,” according to observ e r s
who monitored the poll in February and March
2000.
This may seem an excessive claim. And yet
mobile phones had already won their spurs in
the battle over the results of local elections in
November 1996. Senegal’s interior minister was
caught out when he admitted in a low voice near
an open mobile phone that there had been fra u d .
As a result, President Abdou Diouf was forced to
annul the election.
In the presidential election in 2000, mobile
phones forced the two candidates, President Diouf
and Abdoulaye Wade, to accept the results that
were announced almost instantaneously by private
radio stations.
The two main stations, Wal Fadjri FM and Sud
FM, had sent reporters to cover polling stations all
over the country. Equipped with mobile phones—
a new work tool which is largely replacing the
tape-recorder—they were able to announce the
results as soon as the votes had been counted. The
presence of reporters was boosted in key con-
stituencies with a large number of voters or where
there was a particularly hard-fought contest.
This organized presence of journalists and the
speed with which the results were announced
facilitated the peaceful handover of power from
Diouf to Wade. No fraud was possible. The out-
going president conceded defeat very quickly for
an election in Africa. This defused the tension that
had built up before the second round of the
election and the much-feared clashes betw e e n
supporters of the two political leaders were
avoided.
And, by the way, the Sud FM reporters had to
buy their mobile phones on monthly credit. ■

M A FA L DA AND HER FRIENDS
In 1969, the Italian semiologist Umberto Eco pre-
sented Mafalda to Europe with these words:
“Since our children are soon to become through
our choice a multitude of Mafaldas, it would be
rash not to treat Mafalda with the respect a real
person deserves.” But who is this six-year-old girl
whose name has been given to a square, who was
on the verge of being named an Illustrious Citizen
of Buenos Aires and was chosen as one of the 10
most influential Argentine women of the 20th cen-
t u ry? “The important thing is not what I think of
Mafalda, but what Mafalda thinks of me,” said the
writer Julio Cortazar about this irreverent little girl
who worships the Beatles, hates soup, and is con-
cerned about the Cold War and the health of Planet
Earth. Mafalda shares her concerns with her
parents, who she never ceases to ply with
impertinent questions (“Have you tw o
planned our education or are you just
making it up as you go along?”), and with
her brother Guille, the personification of
childish innocence. The gang is rounded
off by the materialistic Manolito (son of the local
shopkeeper who dreams about owning a chain of
supermarkets), the timid romantic Felipe (who is
always looking for excuses not to got to school),
the narcissistic Miguelito, Susanita
(who hopes to be a housewife and
the mother of a large family), and
Libertad, the smallest of them all.

How would you define your brand of humour?
I don’t think my cartoons are the sort
t h at make people laugh their heads off. I
tend to use a scalpel rather than tickle the
ri b s. I don’t go out of my way to be humor-
o u s ; i t ’s just something that comes out of
m e .I ’d like to be funnier,but as you get older
you become less amusing and more incisive .
Your books have been published to great acclaim
in France, Greece, Italy, China and Portugal. Does
this mean that humour is universal?
I think so. Local connotations vary of
course,above all in political humour. But
QUINO, ON THE FUNN Y
SIDE OF FREEDOM
“I don’t believe humour can alter anything, but sometimes it can be the little grain of sand that acts as a ca talyst to change,” says Argentine
cartoonist Joaquín Salvador Lavado, better known as Quino, who has been hailed as “the greatest Latin American cartoonist of the century. ”
Born in Mendoza in 19 32, he never wanted to be anything but a cartoonist and has spent a lifetime at the drawing board. He won an inter-
national reputation with his Mafalda series (see box), which shows the adult world as seen through the eyes of children. Its main chara c t e r ,
an inquisitive girl who is always asking awkward questions and worries about world peace, has featured in ten books, which have been tra n s-
lated into over 20 languages and published in newspapers and magazines in many parts of the world. Burnt out by the pressure of having to
come up with new ideas every week, Quino decided to stop drawing Mafalda in 1973, and spend more time on other projects that give free
rein to the caustic humour that has always been his hallmark. Meticulously executed in black and white and packed with telling details, his
d rawings focus on power relationships, social inequalities and environmental degradation. In short, on all kinds of issues that, as he readily
admits, “have nothing funny about them.”
a joke can be just as relevant to Franco’s
Spain as to Fidel’s Cuba or the military
r e gimes of Latin A m e ri c a . As for jokes
about food, the kind of things we say
about meat in Argentina can be trans-
posed to rice in Japan. I’ve heard it said
that a North American actor became so
enamoured of a certain form of Japanese
humour that he decided to learn Ja p a n-
ese and export it to the United Stat e s.
When a Japanese joke mentions cherry
p i e , he talks about pizza instead so that
his audience can get the point. But the
humour works the same.
You have never managed to make a
breakthrough in the English-speaking world.
Aren’t you interested in that particular marke t ?
F i rst of all, I ’ ve never thought in market
t e rm s.Things either happened or they didn’t .
Ye a rs ago a book of my cartoons without

the morning paper at the breakfast table.”
But the book didn’t sell. I think the English-
speaking public is used to a much quicker
visual humour than mine. I focus on details,
and a reader always has to ask why I included
this or that particular feat u r e . If I draw a
n e w s p a p e r ,I write things on it that form a sort
of code for the readers.A lot of people don’t
notice these details.As for Mafa l d a , the Bri t i s h
thought she was “too Latin A m e ri c a n .”
Would you say your humour is typically
Argentine?
The Mafalda series is, c e rt a i n l y.The env i-
ronment in which the characters live is the
Buenos Aires neighbourhood where I live d
my s e l f, and Mafa l d a ’s way of talking is also
typically A r g e n t i n e ,e ven in the editions pub-
lished in Spain and elsewhere in Latin A m e r-
i c a . In the rest of my work feat u ring dialogue
I try to use an idiom that is a bit more neu-
t r a l .As for my other cartoons I wo u l d n ’t know
h ow to answer your question. My parents,my
aunts and uncles and my grandparents we r e
all Spanish. I spent my childhood surr o u n d e d
by immigr a n t s : the butcher was Spanish, a n d
so was the shopkeeper who sold us lentils.T h e
gr e e n grocer was Italian, and my parents’a n d
my gr a n d p a r e n t s ’f riends were from A n d a l u-
s i a . My first real contact with Argentines wa s
in pri m a ry school. When I started there I
spoke with such a strong Andalusian accent
t h at my schoolmates couldn’t unders t a n d
w h at I said. I found it hard to mix with them.
Sometimes you use captions, sometimes you
don’t. Do you think text is a crucial factor in
humour?
I would prefer to do without wo r d s. B u t
some ideas would be incomprehensible
without text. Humour is like cinema in this
r e s p e c t .C h a p l i n , for instance, n e ver needed
wo r d s. Neither did Jacques Tat i . But Wo o d y
A l l e n , who doesn’t use visual gags, s t o p s
being funny the moment he stops talking.
What are your favourite subjects?
I don’t think I have any, though over time
I see certain themes crop up again and again.
W h at you find most often in my work is
humour about the weak and the powe r f u l ,
about the relations between power and ordi-
n a ry people. I grew up in a highly politicized
fa m i l y.The Spanish civil war and the rise of
fascism were the dramas that marked my
c h i l d h o o d . They gave me a political vision
of life, one which I like to express in all my
d r aw i n g s. I think power relationships exist
in all situat i o n s , whether a person is fa c e d
with a gove rnment offic i a l , who is always the
p owerful one, or a waiter or a doctor. I ’ m
fa s c i n ated by relationships based on depen-
d e n c e . Other subjects I deal with include life
and deat h , with death as the powerful fig u r e
and the living as the we a k . I wo rry about los-
ing my freedom in old age—I’m terri fied by
the idea of having to depend on other people
for the most basic things. So I draw cart o o n s
of 84-year-olds who want a glass of wine
against their gr a n d c h i l d r e n ’s wishes.
Are there any taboo subjects?
When I start e d , I made jokes about
p ri s o n e rs. P ri s o n e rs and the shipwrecked
are the staples of world humour. But when
people were imprisoned on political
grounds in Argentina, I stopped handling
the subject,and I still couldn’t deal with it
t o d ay. I think it’s counterp r o d u c t i ve to
tackle issues as tragic as prisons and tor-
ture through humour, and though I’ve been
criticized for it, I couldn’t bring myself to
join in Amnesty Intern at i o n a l ’s campaigns.
I don’t like tragedies such as earthquakes
and natural catastrophes either, though I
think this has more to do with a personal
phobia that is not shared, for example, by
Brazilian cart o o n i s t s. Some ye a rs ago a
U ru g u ayan plane carrying a rugby team
crashed in the A n d e s.Those who ultimat e l y
survived had to eat the flesh of those who
had died.A Brazilian humorous magazine
d e voted an entire issue to this episode,
which wa s n ’t in the least funny. But they
managed to make it funny, t e rribly dark bu t
f u n ny.And not so long ago I saw an issue of
a French we e k l y, Le Canard Enchaîné I
think it wa s , which featured a draw i n g
about rape in prison, a subject I would be
incapable of tackling.
Your most recent book, Cuanta Bondad, is full
of drawings that poke fun at modern
technology: the fax, the computer, the mobile
phone. Do you really dislike these things?
I hate mobile phones, and the stupid way
they are used gets on my nerve s. I can under-
stand that a doctor,an electrician or a plumber
might need a mobile phone. Not long ago in
A s t u rias a man saved himself from being
mauled by wo l ves because he called for help
on his mobile.But I can’t stand being in a doc-
t o r ’s waiting room listening to people call to
s ay that the doctor’s late with his appointments
or to ask if they need to stop by the gr o c e r ’s. I
think the Internet is ve ry useful in some cir-
c u m s t a n c e s. In the field of medicine, for exam-
p l e , i t ’s wonderful that a small- town doctor
can consult a leading authority in the United
S t ates or Switzerland. But it’s another thing
entirely to get hooked to the Internet and look
for a partner or spouse by computer search. I

k n ow an old wo m a n , an Italian psychologi s t ,
who communicates with Tibetan monks via
the Internet though I’m sure she never both-
e rs to say hello to her neighbours.A lot of com-
m u n i c ation means people isolate themselve s
from the people around them.
Football also features in some of your pieces.
Do you like the game?
I don’t know as much about football as I
would like, but it interests me above all from
a social viewpoint.I t ’s the only sport that leads
its spectat o rs into cri m e . I ’ ve seen violence
b e t ween ice hockey teams, including the deat h
of a player who was hit in his sternum and left
for dead. But in football it’s the public itself
t h at hits out, attacks and kills. An A m e ri c a n
author who studied the phenomenon of hooli-
ganism in England came to the conclusion
t h at what makes football fru s t r ating is spend-
ing 90 minutes waiting for a goal to be scored.
In basketball, or even in hockey, the scoreline
is changing continually, but in football 30 or
40 minutes can go by without a goal. As a
result fru s t r ation builds up among the spec-
t at o rs and it has to express itself somehow.
I’m more interested in football from that angle
than as a sport ,though I admit there are play-
e rs whom it’s a pleasure to wat c h . W h e n
Johann Cruyff was on the fie l d , it was like
watching Rudolf Nureyev on a stage.
God often appears in your cartoons. Why is that?
I don’t believe in God,but I read the Bible
a lot because it’s a fantastic source of ideas.
And if God doesn’t exist, h e ’s a ve ry good
s u b j e c t .H e ’s a figure about whom it’s impos-
sible to be indifferent: e ve ryone either love s
him or hates him. And he keeps on popping
up in my cartoons because in a way he’s a
character you can identify with. When yo u
d r aw you create things with a pencil, and yo u
can construct on paper all the different wo r l d s
t h at come to your mind. He may not exist,
but as Borges said,i t ’s enough to have a wo r d
t h at designates something for that thing to
come to life.F u rt h e rm o r e ,r e l i gion is like sex
or dru g s : it always sparks reactions and letters
from readers , and I love that .
What is your worst professional memory?
W h at has most annoyed me, without a
s h a d ow of a doubt, has been the use of my
c a rtoons for purposes poles apart from those
t h at inspired me to draw them. I get part i c u-
larly angry when my cartoons are used in
right-wing political campaigns. Once I wa s
sent from Spain a sticker showing Guille,
M a fa l d a ’s brother, c a rrying a pro-Franco
fla g .T h at was a terrible blow,since I was born
in a family that had lost the Spanish civil wa r ,
and films about that period still make me cry.
My comic strips were also used in a political
campaign by an Argentine military offic e r
who had been chief of police in Buenos A i r e s
p r ov i n c e . I wonder if those people have read
my work and totally misunderstood it, o r
whether they understood it all too well and
wanted to twist its meaning.These are things
t h at I simply can’t figure out. I gather that
M a falda has been used in Venezuela in an
election campaign, but I’m not going to hire
a law yer in Caracas because if I did things
would drag on for eve r.
Have you always been totally free to draw as
you please?
It seems paradox i c a l , but under the ru l e
of Argentine military gove rn m e n t s — w h i c h
is the same as saying almost all of them, s i n c e
I ’ ve only known four democratically elected
presidents since I was born—there has neve r
been any official censorship bu r e a u . In con-
trast to Brazil, where there was a body to
which all cartoonists had to submit their
d r awings before they could be published, i n
Argentina it was the editors who tried to talk
you round.The problem was that you neve r
knew what or who the problem wa s , so yo u
s t a rted to censor your own wo r k . When I
a rri ved in Buenos Aires with a file full of car-
toons I realized straightaway that neither the
Church nor the military could be targets, t h at
sex was a subject you had to handle with kid
g l ove s , and there was no question of talking
about homosexuality.Since I was young and
wanted to be published, I buckled down to
the approved subjects. But even today,w h e n
a nything goes,I still find it ve ry hard to get out
of the habit of self-censors h i p.
You lived in exile during the military
dictatorship2. Were you forced to leave the
country?
I left when the situation was really bad.A lot of
my friends had disappeared,and when I we n t
to deliver a cartoon to a magazine that pub-
lished my wo r k , I would find that a bomb had
just gone off there or that the building had
been machine-gunned the night before.W i t h
work like mine, which can be done on a hotel
table in any place you like, it would have been
stupid to stay. B e t ween 1976 and 1979 I live d
in Italy.Then I started to go back to see how
things we r e , and today I live for eight months
of the year in Buenos Aires and the rest of the
time in Milan, which is my European base. I
also spend a lot of time in Spain and France.
Outside Argentina, have you had to make any
concessions to ensure your books get published?
A few,ye s , but usually for anecdotal not
to say comic reasons. Some 15 ye a rs ago I
found out by chance that Mafalda was ve ry
well known in China. A little Chinese gi r l
told me this when she asked me to auto-
graph an album at a Buenos Aires book fa i r.
Until then I had no idea that my books had
been published in China, so I was ve ry
i n t ri g u e d .Through a friend I managed to
find out that the pirated editions had been
produced in Ta i wa n , and that the editor, l i k e
all good pirat e s , was English. My agent
managed to get these pirate editions with-
d r aw n , and regular editions have recently
s t a rted to be published in mainland China.
I was there a few months ago, and I asked
h ow they had translated all the strips in
which Mafalda talks about the ye l l ow peri l .
When I wrote those strips we had just found
out that China had the atomic bomb,a rev-
e l ation that caused gr ave concern in the
We s t .They told me that eve rything about
China had been cut, since they thought that
I didn’t know enough about China to gi ve
an opinion—a wonderful piece of reason-
i n g, I thought. I also found out that
S u s a n i t a , M a fa l d a ’s friend who dreams
about having a big fa m i l y, is regarded as a2. 1976-1983

v i rtual subve rs i ve due to China’s fa m i l y
planning policy.
Mafalda is anything but politically correct. Has
this ever caused you any problems?
I still recall a case involving Cuba, a
c o u n t ry I’ve visited seven or eight times and
where I have good fri e n d s.T h e r e ’s a Cuban
edition of Mafalda and an animated fil m
s e ries based on the strip cartoon was made
t h e r e . But whenever I go to Cuba, s o m e o n e
asks me to explain the strip in which Mafa l d a
is sitting in front of a plate of soup—the dish
she hates more than anything—and wo n-
d e rs why Fidel Castro doesn’t sing the praises
of soup so that it can be banned in A r g e n t i n a .
I t ’s certainly true that back then anything to
do with Cuba was suspect in A r g e n t i n a .B u t
w h at Mafalda actually says is:“ W hy doesn’t
‘ t h at idiot’ Fidel Castro. . . ? ”The Spanish
newspaper El Pa i s has censored some of my
d r awings on the grounds that they are too
“ gri m ” , to which I reply that I may be gri m ,
but I’m never as grim as real life.
Your Mafalda series has been compared to
Schulz’s Peanuts.
N at u r a l l y. I started the Mafalda stri p
after being commissioned to adve rtise a
brand of domestic appliances for which I
was specifically asked to do something of
the same kind. I bought all the books by
Schulz that I could find in Buenos A i r e s ,
studied them and then tried to do some-
thing similar but adapted to our situation.
The campaign never got off the gr o u n d
because the magazine that was going to
publish the cartoons realized it was closet
a d ve rt i s i n g . So I put my drawings away
until a year later, in 1964, when I rescued
them for the magazine Primera Plana.
Why do you think Mafalda is still being
published and read almost 30 years after you
stopped producing it?
I suppose it’s because part of the mes-
sage is still relevant.The human race still
has a lot of issues to address.The world of
which Mafalda was so cri t i c a l , the wo r l d
that existed in 1973 when I stopped pro-
ducing the strip has not disappeared; per-
haps it’s even got worse.Though it flatters
me to know that Mafalda is still being read,
i t ’s also sad to think that the social injustice
she denounced remains in place.
Why did you stop drawing Mafalda, against
your readers’ wishes?
Humour and art in general wear them-
s e l ves out. I admired Schulz a lot, and I
loved Peanuts. I read the strips with great
enthusiasm for 10 or 15 years. But I would
h ave liked to have seen that special brand of
humour reflected in other things. I feel the
same about the Colombian painter Fe r-
nando Botero: I just don’t think he should
keep on painting f at figures all his life.As
for my s e l f, after ten ye a rs of Mafa l d a , I
s t a rted to suffer each time I drew a new
instalment, and I found it extremely hard
not to repeat myself.When I started draw-
ing, I learnt that if you conceal from some-
one the last drawing in a strip and that per-
son still knows how it’s going to end, then
your story isn’t up to scratch.Even though
the books continue to sell ve ry well and
people ask me for more, I think that I made
the right decision when I stopped doing
Mafalda,and I don’t miss her at all.

once told me that hundreds of people wo u l d
l ove to have their own weekly page to say
w h at e ver they liked.Becoming aware of that
responsibility made me feel dizzy, but as for
the rest, i t ’s none of my bu s i n e s s.
Do you identify with any of your characters?
I identify to some extent with all of them.
I believe that all the characters who appear in
my drawings are releva n t . I learnt this from an
i n t e rview with the A m e rican film director
Frank Capra, who was talking about the
i m p o rtance of extras.When he filmed street
scenes he would speak to each of the extras
and carefully describe their role.Yo u ,m a d a m ,
are an anxious woman going to the pharm a cy
to buy medicine because your husband is
s i c k .Yo u ,s i r , are a decorator going to paint an
a p a rtment and yo u ’re lat e . E ve ry character
who appeared in Capra’s fil m s , e ven in the
b a c k gr o u n d , had a story. L i k e w i s e , when I
d r aw a restaurant, I imagine that the man
s e ated at the table behind works in a bank
and has a brother-in-law who has gone to live
in Ve n e z u e l a . I love doing that .
You once said that human beings are the
cancer of the planet. Is there no hope?
I’ll gi ve you just one example: it has
a lways been said that the Amazon region con-
stitutes the lungs of our planet, but that does-
n ’t stop people from continuing to destroy it.

Nevertheless, you have drawn her again . . . .
Ye s. UNICEF commissioned some
d r awings for the tenth annive rs a ry of the
C o nvention on the Rights of the Child, a n d
I was delighted to do them.I also drew her
again for the fifth anniversary of President
Raul Alfonsín’s democratic government in
Argentina, and I’ve allowed her to be used
in public health campaigns and on behalf of
causes that I think worthwhile. Now I use
her when I want to protest against some-
t h i n g — s h e ’s the spokeswoman for my rage.
But I never have agreed and never will
a gree to her being used in adve rtising cam-
paigns, nor will I allow any adaptation for
the theatre or the cinema. The only con-
cession I have made was for an animated
film because drawings were used in it.
What do you tell your readers, especially
children, who ask you to draw Mafalda again?
I t ’s easy to answer children. I drew
Mafalda for 10 years,so I always tell them
the same thing.I say:imagine having to do
the same thing eve ry morning from the day
you were born until today.Would you like
t h at? They always say no. Fifteen- or six-
teen-year-olds are harder to convince,and
I don’t think I manage to do so.
Certain pseudo-scientific studies circulate on
the Internet arguing that Latin American
children who read Mafalda tend to hate soup.
Some girls have actually been named after
her. A magazine even chose her as one of the
10 most influential Argentine women of the
20th century. Isn’t this a heavy responsibility?
A b s o l u t e l y. But the real responsibility for
me is facing a blank page each week on
which I can say what e ver I please. S o m e o n e

Humans are like that .They keep on smoking

strongly agree with the Po rtuguese Nobel lit-

will one day regain their lost prestige. I think

while trying to fly.But before they could fly in
hang gliders or ultralight aircraft, they firs t
had to invent the internal combustion engi n e ,

flying since the fifteenth century. I t ’s a bit like

Do you always draw in black and white?
Ye s , with a few exceptions.The French
edition of Mafalda is in colour because the
publisher thinks that if it’s not in colour, i t
wo n ’t sell in France. I agreed but I’m not ve ry
happy about it. M a falda as I see it is in black
and white, and in general I prefer comics in
black and white except when colour really
adds something. Of course when you see

colour does add something. I use it ve ry spar-
