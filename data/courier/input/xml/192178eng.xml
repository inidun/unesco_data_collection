ostein GAArDer: A user’s 
mAnuAl for our PlAnet
As pollution and climate change threaten 
human survival on our planet, Norwegian 
philosopher Jostein Gaarder –the internationally celebrated author 
of “Sophie’s World” – argues that philosophy can help us defuse 
the time bomb that is ticking away. 4
michel onfrAy:  
A PhilosoPher  
of the enliGhtenment
From art and politics to bioethics, religion, 
the internet and the odyssey of tea, French philosopher Michel 
Onfrey focuses on a multitude of issues that concern contem- 
porary humanity in his numerous books and lectures. For Mr 
Onfray, philosophy must be effective on the existential plane. 5
m. e. orellAnA benADo :  
the humAnity of humour
“There is nothing so ridiculous but some  
philosopher has said it,” Cicero argued. 
Chilean philosopher M. E. Orellana Benado for his part postulates 
that humour “has more to do with the diversity of ways in which we 
live (that is to say, with our identities), than with the way we reason 
and think (that is to say with our nature as human beings).” 7
Peter J. KinG : PhilosoPhy 
AGAinst mAniPulAtion
Philosophy cannot make people honest, be-
lieves British Professor Peter J. King, author of 
100 Philosophers: a guide to the greatest thinkers of humanity. But it 
gives us the tools to defend ourselves against those who are neither 
benevolent nor truthful …who wish to manipulate us. 9
ioAnnA KuçurADi:  
A sisyPheAn tAsK
The confusion prevailing in particular in 
political discourse makes it possible to 
claim “the right to offend”1 or to ascribe different meanings 
to the same terms: freedom of expression, laicité, terror etc. 
Philosophy can provide the tools against this misuse which has 
crucial results for practice, believes Turkish philosopher Ioanna 
Kuçuradi. 11
mohAmmeD ArKoun : 
PhilosoPhy AnD reliGion,

“Islamizing” modernity instead of modernizing Islam – prepos- 
terous! worries Professor Mohammed Arkoun. A refuge in poor 
countries, a rejection of “tele-techno-scientific reasoning”  
in rich countries, religiosity is spreading in the world at the  
expense of humanist values and philosophical thinking. 13
KwAsi wireDu :

If the logical independence of morality from religion were to be 
generally understood, some of the ferocity of current conflicts 
might be reduced, says Ghanaian philosopher Kwasi Wiredu. 13
woo-tAK Kee : towArDs

It is the philosopher’s task to “recover  
humanity” believes South-Korean philosopher Woo-Tak Kee  
who recommends a world philosophy for a world community.  
A philosophy that should play an important part in the universality 
within cultural diversity. 13

PhilosoPhy
A cosmic 
resPonsibility
eight philosophers contributed 
to this issue of the UNESCO Courier, 
focusing on the role of philosophy today. 
Different approaches, varied concerns, 
but one certainty: philosophy can’t stay 
in its ivory tower. it provides a weapon 
against dogma and manipulation. 
And, to cite one of 
Jostein Gaarder’s ideas, philosophers 
have a cosmic responsibility.
tey stand up against dogma and 
manipulative arguments. They ex-
press concern about intolerance 
and rising fanaticism. They remind us 
too that we are primates and our first 
task should be taking care of the planet. 
And they advocate philosophy that 
goes beyond mere words. 
“I don’t believe at all in what is com-
monly called today the death of phi-
losophy,” wrote French philosopher 
Jacques Derrida in 1972. 
Nor do the philosophers in this issue. 
But they do recognize that philoso-
phy’s impact on society is not what 
it could be, and philosophers them-
selves are partly to blame. And how 
could they make themselves useful? 
“By avoiding speaking in a way that 
is abstruse, fuzzy, incomprehensible, 
to a few fans of sectarian modes of 
thinking who get off on sticking to-
gether and intellectually reproducing 
through incest,” answers Michel On-
fray (France), a resolutely down-to-
earth philosopher. 
Jostein Gaarder (Norway) would be 
the last to contradict him, being some-
one who advocates a philosophy that 
can help us write the instruction man-
ual for spaceship Earth. “Philosophy 
is nothing less than a celebration of 
mankind’s consciousness,” he says. 
“So shouldn’t a philosopher be the 
first to defend human consciousness 
against annihilation?” Here, the author 
of “Sophie’s World” warns us, “We 
are the first generation to affect the cli-
mate on earth – and perhaps the last 
that won’t have to pay the price for it.” 
As for Turkish philosopher Ioanna 
Kuçuradi, she explores the verbal 
domain to denounce a certain con-
ceptual confusion, reigning notably in 
political discourse. She takes interest 
in the word “value”, which she sees as 
a catch-all term, stating, “In an age in 
which the search for meaning leads 
people to become suicide bombers, 
fully grasping the concept of value and 
that linked to ethical values is another 
task expected from philosophers.” 
“Dictators rarely oppress whole 
populations; rather, they persuade 
eDitoriAl 
part of their population to help with 
the oppression of the rest, and they 
generally do this by presenting spu-
rious arguments and flimsy but 
specious claims,” notes Peter J. King 
(United Kingdom). Yet another philoso- 
pher who wants to clear up the ver-
bal fog conjured up by simplistic non 
sequiturs and deception. 
“In countries under the boot of author-
itarian, not to say rogue, regimes,” con-
tinues Mohammed Arkoun (Algeria), 
“the return of religion can be inter-
preted as the quest for refuge.” And 
he underlines that religiosity is gaining 
ground in the richest societies too, 
resulting in the marginalization of 
philosophical thought and culture. 
Let us abolish religion’s authority over 
morality, admit we are not infallible, 
stop imposing our mores as universal 
law – we will stand a better chance 
of establishing a dialogue enabling us 
to avoid conflicts, adds Kwasi Wiredu 
(Ghana). 
Woo-Tak Kee concurs. “There is 
a limit to the roles that religion and 
politics can play in resolving conflicts 
among human cultures. It’s the philos-
ophers who should provide solutions,” 
writes the South Korean philosopher, 
who launches here a debate on a 
philosophy of universality, or, to put it 
another way, a philosophy in search 
of universality in the midst of cultural 
diversity. 
It is precisely the diversity of our lives 
that produces humour, writes M. E. 
Orellana Benado (Chile) who choos-
es to tackle the question of philoso-
phy from the angle of laughter. “Our 
human world is essentially incongru-
ous,” he says. “This is why it helps us 
in our survival to be able to extract the 
comic aspect of the incongruous.” 
Alongside this main dossier, the 
Courier presents two retrospectives: 
one is a collection of interviews 
we have previously published, 
“Philosophers’ Corner”; the other 
focuses on “Philosophers celebrated 
by UNESCO.”

rather they represent the culmina-
tion of a thousand-year maturing 
process, a process which to a large 
extent was carried forward by the 
written word. Behind this humanistic 
tradition were flesh and blood indi-
viduals who, at certain times of their 
lives, sat down to think and write – 
and they thought on behalf of the 
whole of humanity.
Towards a Universal 
Declaration of Human 
Obligations
The question that faces us at the start 
of a new millennium is how long we 
can go on talking about rights without 
simultaneously focusing on the indi-
vidual’s obligations. Maybe we need 
a new universal declaration. Perhaps 
the time is ripe for a Universal 
Declaration of Human Obligations. It 
is simply no longer meaningful to talk 
about rights without simultaneously 
stressing the individual state’s or per-
son’s obligations. 
An important bedrock of all ethics 
has been “the golden rule:” Do unto 
others as you would have them do 
unto you. Immanuel Kant defined this 
reciprocal principle by pointing out 
that the right action is the one we 
would want everyone to perform in a 
similar situation. Two hundred years 
after Kant’s death we have just about 
begun to get used to the idea that 
the reciprocal principle must also ap-
ply between rich and poor countries. 
In addition, it must include the rela-
tionship between the generations. 
The question is whether we would 
have wanted previous generations 
to cut down more forests and rain 
forests. Would we have preferred 
it if our ancestors had exterminated 
even more plant and animal species? 
If not, we are duty bound to preserve 
biological diversity. We cannot even 
be sure that Kant would have toler-
ated our high consumption of non-
renewable energy sources. We must 
n his later years the German phi-
losopher Immanuel Kant pointed 
out that it was a necessary moral 
imperative for every country to join 
together in a “league of nations” 
whose job would be to ensure their 
peaceful co-existence. As such, this 
German philosopher would seem 
to have first fathered the idea of the 
United Nations. 
About 200 years later we were able 
to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary 
of the UN’s Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. And there was good 
reason to celebrate this milestone, 
as human rights still need to be pro-
tected against infringements and 
brutal violations. The only difference 
now is that, for more than fifty years, 
we have had an institution and an 
instrument with which to defend 
these rights. 
Perhaps the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights represents the 
greatest triumph of philosophy so 
far. For human rights were not be-
stowed on us by higher powers, nor 
were they plucked from thin air, but 
                             As pollution and climate change threaten human survival on our planet, 
                                      norwegian philosopher Jostein Gaarder –the internationally celebrate

first make sure that we would have 
wished our ancestors to burn the 
same amount of coal and oil per head 
as we do. 
We are the first generation to affect 
the climate on earth – and perhaps 
the last that won’t have to pay the 
price for it.
We are primates
It has been said that the problem with 
Spaceship Earth is that it didn’t come 
with instructions. But in that case, 
why don’t we get on and write an 
instruction manual? For that we will 
need philosophy!
We are often told that ideologies are 
dead. But isn’t consumerism also an 
ideology? And is this really the only 
possible model? 
One important question for phi-
losophy at the beginning of the third 
millennium must be: what shift in 
consciousness do we need? What is a 
sustainable wisdom? Which qualities 
of life are the most important? Which 
values are the true values? What is 
the good life? And importantly: what 
kind of mobilisation is possible in the 
global village? 
Today, many of us understand the 
challenges facing the planet. But we 
feel paralysed by political and eco-
nomic systems. Politicians, too, have 
a far greater insight than might appear 
from their practice. And this is the par-
adox: we have sufficient insight – and 
we know that time is short – but we 
aren’t able to turn things round before 
it will be too late. Philosophy will have 
to play a decisive part if we are to suc-
ceed in negotiating the sea change 
necessary for our survival. In the same 
way that philosophers and authors 
have constituted an avant-garde in 
the fight for human rights, so they may 
form a vanguard in the struggle for hu-
man obligations.
According to an old parable a frog 
that is dropped into boiling water will 
immediately jump out again and so 
save its skin. But if the frog is placed 
in a pan of cold water that is gradu-
ally brought to boiling point, it will be 
unaware of the danger and be boiled 
to death. 
Is our generation like that frog? Is 
modern philosophy such a frog? We 
may not know, but it really is down to 
us to decide. We can’t count on any 
outside help. We’re not likely to be 
saved in the final second before boil-
ing point – either from outer space or 
by some form of supernatural inter-
vention. 
Human beings are largely social crea-
tures. We are in addition pretty self-
centred and vain. But we can’t contin-
ue only to relate to each other. We also 
belong to the earth we live on. That, 
too, is a significant part of our identity. 
To a large extent we modern human 
beings have been shaped by our cul-
tural history, by the actual civilisation 
that has nurtured us. We say that we 
have a cultural heritage. But we have 
also been formed by the biological his-
tory of the planet. We also pass on a 
genetic inheritance. We are primates. 
We are vertebrates. 
It took several billion years to cre-
ate us. But will we survive the third 
millennium? 
Human beings are possibly the only 
living creatures in the universe with a 
universal consciousness. And so our 
responsibility to preserve the living 
environment of this planet is not only 
global but cosmic. 
Philosophy is nothing less than a 
celebration of mankind’s conscious-
ness. So shouldn’t a philosopher be 
the first to defend human conscious-
ness against annihilation?
Dr Jostein Gaarder, 
Norwegian philosopher
Preserving the biological diversity is a duty.

                         from art and politics to bioethics, religion, the internet 
       and the odyssey of tea, french philosopher michel onfrey focuses 
       on a multitude of issues that concern contemporary humanity 
  in his numerous books and lectures. for mr onfray, philosophy must be 
                   effective on the existential plane.
Michel onfray  
A philosopher of the enlightenment
You once said that philosophy 
doesn’t fall from the heaven of 
ideas, but rises up from earth. 
Would you explain? 
There is in fact a multitude of ways 
to practice philosophy, but out of 
this multitude, the dominant histori-
ography picks one tradition among 
others and makes it the truth of 
philosophy: that is to say the ide-
alist, spiritualist lineage compat-
ible with the Judeo-Christian world 
view. From that point on, anything 
that crosses this partial – in both 
senses of the word – view of things 
finds itself dismissed. This applies 
to nearly all non-Western philoso-
phies, Oriental wisdom in particu-
lar, but also sensualist, empirical, 
materialist, nominalist, hedonistic 
currents and everything that can be 
put under the heading of “anti-Pla-
tonic philosophy”. Philosophy that 
comes down from the heavens is 
the kind that - from Plato to Levinas 
by way of Kant and Christianity - 
needs a world behind the scenes to 
understand, explain and justify this 
world. The other line of force rises 
from the earth because it is satis-
fied with the given world, which is 
already so much. 
You define yourself as  
a hedonistic philosopher.  
What does this term comprise 
for you? 
Hedonism is one of the philoso-
phies not compatible with Judeo-
Christianity and therefore cast 
aside by the dominant historiog-
raphy. In opposition to the ascetic 
ideal advocated by the dominant 
school of thought, hedonism sug-
gests identifying the highest good 
with your own pleasure and that of 
others; the one must never be in-
dulged at the expense of sacrificing 
the other. Obtaining this balance 
– my pleasure at the same time as 
the pleasure of others – presumes 
that we approach the subject from 
different angles – political, ethical, 
aesthetic, erotic, bioethical, peda-
gogical, historiographical…I have 
written books on each of these fac-
ets of the same world view.
You’ve been attacked virulently 
for your atheistic stance,  
to the point of receiving death 
threats. How do you respond?
I note that believers prove me 
right when I state that monotheism 
is intrinsically intolerant, vindictive 
and intellectually exterminating….
If someone threatens to kill you 
for saying their religion is intoler-
ant, they prove what I’m saying is 
unfortunately true. In Europe, we 
live under democratic regimes; 
elsewhere, in other times and other 
places, there wouldn’t have been 
these threats, I would have had my 
head chopped off directly. 
You are an action philosopher 
who fights on every front.  
How can a philosopher make  
himself “useful” today? 
By radically turning your back on 
the academic, doctoral way of pro-
ceeding, that is to say by avoiding 
speaking in a way that is abstruse, 
fuzzy, incomprehensible, to a few 
fans of sectarian modes of thinking 
Michel Onfray (France).

who get off on sticking together and 
reproducing intellectually through 
incest. Therefore by expressing 
yourself clearly and simply, like 
Seneca or Cicero…And then by 
ceasing to lecture everybody, and 
by being content to remain only in 
the realm of the verb, where things 
are so easy, and yet trying to pro-
duce philosophical effects on the 
existential level – there too like the 
ancient philosophers – in places or-
ganized for that purpose, like for in-
stance in “universités populaires” *. 
  
Can we compare 
the “Université populaire”  
in Caen, which you launched  
in 2002, to the school  
in the Garden of Epicurus? 
I started a second one in 
Argentan, in Normandie (France), 
my home town, which is a sub-pre-
fecture damaged by the harshness 
of the free market, and which is 
habitually ignored by the powers-
that-be in the capital, but also by 
the regional and departmental au-
thorities. What I wondered, in fact, 
was what a micro-resistance to the 
micro-fascisms of our era could be 
like, in an open community inspired 
by an Epicureanism in touch with 
our post-industrial modernity.
For you, nothing is universal. 
Can this idea be identified  
with that of cultural diversity,  
as advocated by UNESCO?
No, some things are universal. I 
believe, for instance, a man is worth 
the same as a woman, a white 
person is worth a black person, 
a doctor of philosophy is worth a 
peasant on the Nile, an atheist is 
worth neither more nor less than 
a devout Jew, a handicapped per-
son is worth a sports champion, 
in other words one being is worth 
another being, whatever they both 
are. That’s the first universal thing 
I believe. 
The second one is that a happy 
human being is better than an un-
happy human being, and every-
thing must be done to increase the 
universal dose of pleasure and re-
duce the dose of pain as much as 
possible. 
Finally, of course I believe in the 
diversity of cultures and the need 
to safeguard them, but I also be-
lieve that some cultures are bet-
ter than others. I do indeed think 
a civilization is more worthwhile 
where little girls are not genitally 
mutilated, rather than one where 
their wholeness is destroyed; a 
civilization in which you can say 
the opposite of what your coun-
try’s spiritual and temporal powers 
think, rather than one where you’re 
sent to the gallows because your 
thinking doesn’t match the norm. I 
believe that a civilization that gives 
homosexuals the same rights as 
heterosexuals is better than one 
that jails them, etc. 
I’m just a philosopher of the Enligh- 
tenment who thinks the Light is 
preferable to the Darkness and 
the Declaration of Human Rights 
superior to legal texts drawn from 
age-old mythologies…

education centres)

C of reasoning]. This is what is meant 
by Socrates humorous claim: “Only 
one thing I know, and that is that I 
know nothing”. The Oracle had said 
that he was the wisest of men. But 
when his fellow Athenians came 
to him with this piece of news, 
Socrates forced them to realize 
that they still had to make up their 
own minds. The coming of age of 
European university philosophy is 
marked by Kant´s equivalent claim 
in “Was ist Aufklärung?” when he 
sums up the Enlightenment in the 
maxim: Sapere aude! Dare to think 
(for yourself)!
Some are more equal 
than others
Humour permeates humanity. 
More, humour is both the most pene- 
trating of our theoretical capacities 
and the most human of our practi-
M. e. orellana Benado :  
the humAnity of humour
ompare the rhetorical impact of the 
following claims: 
1. “Prof. Dr. B. might be the great-
est philosopher alive today, but she 
lacks a sense of humour”
and, 
2. “Prof. Dr. O. might be the great-
est thief alive today, but he has a 
sharp sense of humour”. 
Lacking a sense of humour di-
minishes the value of a person’s 
achievements, whereas its posses-
sion rescues the humanity even of 
those whose behaviour is despica-
ble. In this article I propose to dis-
cuss the role of humour, the human-
ity of humour as I prefer to call it. 
The birth of Greek philosophy was 
completed when a field of reflec-
tion and debate appeared in which 
authority arguments where not al-
lowed [i.e. ad baculum arguments 
in which authority takes the place 
cal abilities. By “theoretical” I mean 
capacities directed to the contem-
plation or perception of the world; 
by “practical” I mean those that al-
low us to manipulate it or to bring it 
into existence. Our human world is 
essentially incongruous. This is why 
it helps us in our survival to be able 
to extract the comic aspect of the 
incongruous as well as to perceive 
the comic when we face it. But, why 
is the human world incongruous? 
The reason is as simple as it is 
unavoidable. Things human need 
to be approached in two opposite 
ways. According to a luminous and 
basic truth: All human beings are 
equal. Different grounds have been 
offered for this abstract postulate: 
that we all are God’s creatures; that 
we are all free; that we all have the 
same nature and are thus liable to 
suffer and, to cut short the list, that 
we have the same human rights. 
But concrete experience shows an 
approach based on another lumi-
nous truth, ironically formulated by 
George Orwell as “some are more 
equal than others”. The grounds ad-
vanced for this vary: only we belong 
to the true religion or, indeed, to no 
religion; to this or that country, gen-
der, social class, political party or, 
to this or that profession, and so the 
list goes on. 
We need to speak of ourselves 
as having different identities or life-
styles. The concept of prejudice is 
closely linked to that of identity or, 
if you prefer, lifestyle. There is no 
identity without its foundation of 
prejudices. In the case of personal 
identity, each individual human be-
ing is only equal to him or herself. All 
cultures rightly signal the birth and 
        “there is nothing so ridiculous but some philosopher has said it,” cicero argued. 
                    chilean philosopher m. e. orellana benado for his part postulates 
                             that humour “has more to do with the diversity of ways in which we live 
            (that is to say, with our identities), than with the way we reason and think 
                      (that is to say with our nature as human beings).”

death of their members in a special 
fashion. Every time a new human 
being is born something unique has 
come into existence. And each time 
one of us dies something unique 
has gone out of it.
Humour:  
mirror of our identities
Among other things, human equa- 
lity means that we are all liable to 
suffer. This is where Black Humour 
enters the stage, in its two forms. 
One manifests itself when we laugh 
at incongruities related to our own 
suffering so as to distance our-
selves from it. This human capacity 
has been widely documented. Even 
in Nazi extermination camps, some 
prisoners joked about their pre-
dicament. The other form of Black 
Humour involves laughing to come 
close to the suffering of others. 
Such was the case, for example, 
with the jokes about anthropophagy 
made by Chileans in 1973 when, 
over two months after their plane 
crashed in the Andes, a few surviv-
ing members of a Uruguayan rugby 
team were found. Chileans were 
laughing with the young survivors, 
and not laughing at the victims of 
such a horrible experience. Black 
Humour reflects human equality, 
under which lurks the reality of hu-
man suffering. 
Exit Black Humour, and enter its 
counterpart: Prejudiced Humour. 
The interaction between different 
human identities often presents as 
ridiculous the peculiar practices 
of different lifestyles. Take Scho-
penhauer’s story about the “White 
Man” and the “Red Indian”. Upon 
seeing him leave food on his an-
cestor’s grave, the former asks 
whether the tribe expects the de-
ceased to return from death and 
eat it. After smiling silently for an 
instant, the “Red Indian” replies: 
“Sure, the same day your ances-
tors will return from death to look at 
the beautiful flowers your tribe puts 
on their graves”. By laughing with 
Prejudiced Humour at alien practic-
es we keep a distance from human 
identities or lifestyles different from 
our own. 
Rational argument only becomes 
possible between those who, to an 
extent, share the same sense of hu-
mour; that is to say, agreement on 
what is worth taking seriously and 
what only deserves a laugh. But 
what is serious and what is comic 
has more to do with the diversity of 
ways in which we live (that is to say, 
with our identities), than with the 
way we reason and think (that is to 
say with our nature as human be-
ings). Perhaps this is what Cicero 
suggested when he claimed that 
“there is nothing so ridiculous but 
some philosopher has said it.

                                 but it gives us the tools to defend ourselves against those

ghe term “philosophy” is used in a 
wide variety of ways, even in aca-
demic contexts; in what follows I 
shall use it to refer to a particular 
kind of approach to questions, con-
cepts, problems, and issues. As I 
understand it, then, philosophy is 
an activity, a process not a product; 
it aims at clear, impartial analysis 
and argument. Its subject matter is 
extremely varied, but in general it 
deals with matters at a higher level 
of abstraction and generality than 
other disciplines. Thus while, for 
example, a physical scientist makes 
observations, devises experiments, 
develops theories, etc., the phi-
losopher of science tackles such 
matters as the analysis and exami-
nation of the nature of observation 
and theory and the relationship be-
tween them, the role of experimen-
tation, and the very nature of the 
scientific enterprise. 
But if philosophy is simply a matter 
of thinking clearly and without bias, 
practitioners of other disciplines 
are surely justified in protesting 
that they are as able to do that as 
is the philosopher. One response is 
that indeed they are — but having 
the ability is one thing, having the 
time and the inclination is another. 
Philosophical education is in large 
part a training in patience, rigour, 
and thoroughness; the philosopher 
must be prepared to take great and 
often lengthy pains to work through 
complex analyses of concepts and 
arguments — and most people have 
neither the time nor the tempera-
ment to do that. Another response 
is that, while other disciplines typi-
cally involve techniques of thought 
and analysis specific to a certain 
subject matter or goal, as well, of 
course, as a mass of knowledge of 
facts, theories, practical skills, etc., 
philosophy is wholly general, aiming 
to prepare its practitioners to inves-
tigate anything.
Of course, neither philosophical 
ability nor the willingness to use it 
are confined to professional philo- 
sophers; indeed, when non-profes-
sionals philosophise they are quite 
capable of producing results at 
least as important as those of their 
professional counterparts. 
Thinking is one thing, 
thinking clearly quite 
another
In fact professional philosophers, as 
a result of many pressures, not least 
the intense pressure to publish, too 
often find themselves delving into 
increasingly technical treatments of

increasingly narrow issues, the re-
sult generally being notable only for 
its triviality and aridity. 
It might also be objected that, 
if philosophising is just a matter 
of thinking about things, then all 
human beings are philosophers. 
Aren’t we all Homo sapiens? Don’t 
we all think? Thinking, however, is 
one thing, thinking clearly, dispas-
sionately, and disinterestedly quite 
another. A quick trip to the Internet 
will bring this home. Look at almost 
any discussion in any forum, and 
you will find not only prejudice and 
partiality, but also a failure on the 
part of most participants to develop 
sound arguments of their own or 
to understand the arguments of 
others. Not only are many people 
unwilling to listen to, understand, 
and consider the positions and ar-
guments of those with whom they 
disagree — they seem simply to be 
unable to do so. Astonishing non 
sequiturs are commonplace, as are 
the conflations of distinct positions, 
simple logical fallacies, and an 
inability to spot such flaws in the 
arguments of others.
Philosophy  
as a protection
The ability to philosophise is use-
less, however, without the right 
aims and objectives. For example, 
the philosophising of a good per-
son may help her to perform the 
right actions, but no amount of 
rigour, patience, and analytic ability 
will turn a bad person into a good 
one. The philosophical method is 
simply a tool, which can be used – 
expertly or inexpertly – to do good 
or ill. Philosophy, as Socrates and 
Plato discovered the hard way, can-
not make people good or truthful; 
education won’t turn a dictator into 
a philosopher king, but may simply 
turn him into a more efficient dicta-
tor. Dictators rarely oppress whole 
populations; rather, they persuade 
part of their population to help with 
the oppression of the rest, and they 
generally do this by presenting spu-
rious arguments and flimsy but spe-
cious claims. Politicians in democ-
racies use the same techniques to 
try to win elections. What philoso-
phy can do is help us to defend our-
selves against those who wish to 
manipulate us, against those who 
are neither benevolent nor truthful. 
It cannot make people honest, but 
it gives us the tools with which to 
discover their dishonesty. 
Of course, philosophy offers great 
scope for the enrichment of the 
philosopher’s life, and many would 
argue that this is its most important 
feature. (It can also be extremely ab-
sorbing, and even fun.) Moreover, 
its breadth and reach mean that it 
has many roles for us today, some 
potential and some actual. With 
regard to the world beyond itself, 
though, whether in the field of poli-
tics or of religion, of commerce or of 
ethics, its usefulness lies primarily 
in the protection it offers against 
those who would, intentionally or 
otherwise, cloud our thoughts and 
lead us into error..

                  the confusion prevailing in particular in political discourse makes it possible 
                         to claim “the right to offend”1 or to ascribe different meanings to the same terms: 
                         freedom of expression, laicité, terror etc. Philosophy can provide the tools against 
            this misuse which has crucial results for practice, believes turkish philosopher ioanna Kuçuradi.  
ioanna Kuçuradi :  
A sisypheAn tAsk
  nterest in philosophy has increased 
all over the world in the past few 
decades. To deal with philosophy, 
especially with so-called applied 
philosophy and ethics, has become 
fashionable. Thus philosophy has 
moved out of its ivory tower into the 
open air. 
This development is double-edged. 
On the one hand it helps increase the 
number of people who try to reflect 
on what is going on around them, 
but on the other this popularization 
of philosophy, can be dangerous: any 
unscrutinized or confused thought 
dares present itself as philosophy. 
The main role of philosophy is, I think, 
to shed a strong light on what is go-
ing on in the world –a light that also 
makes it possible to see the ethical el-
ements inherent in all human relations 
and action– and thus help us better 
understand what has to be done 
–or what can be done– in a given 
concrete situation, so that human be-
ings can live with dignity. If philoso-
phy wishes to play this role, what are 
philosophers’ special tasks?
A mish mash of words
One of the issues that philosophers 
are expected to deal with is the 
conceptual confusion prevailing in 
all areas of human endeavour, but 
above all in political and semi-political 
discourse. This confusion makes it 
easier to use words expressing cer-
tain concepts and ideas, in order to 
hide interests. To fight this misuse of 
words we need clear concepts. 
It is widely assumed that, in the social 
and human sciences, there cannot 
be any “definitions accepted by ev-
erybody”. The lack of such definitions 
has crucial results for practice. For ex-
ample, it makes it possible to speak of 
“the right to offend”1 or to ascribe dif-
ferent meanings to the same terms ac-
cording to interests, as often happens 
at present with terms like freedom of 
expression, laicité, terror etc. Perhaps 
there are no epistemically justifiable 
definitions, but this does not mean 
that none can be made. And making 
them is a typical job for philosophers. 
Another term fraught with problems 
is “value”. People –including many 
philosophers– call value what they as-
sume to be “good”. In an age in which 
the search for meaning leads people 
to become suicide bombers, fully 
grasping the concept of value and that 
linked to ethical values is another task 
expected from philosophers.
An urgent task for philosophers 
at present is to explain the different 
kinds of norms. If we are aware of the 
Ioanna Kuçuradi (Turkey).

epistemological differences among 
them, we can no longer put human 
rights norms and cultural norms in the 
same pot, and consequently claim 
that human rights are “European 
values” that are quite different from 
“Asian values”. 
Clear concepts  
and ethical values
To produce norms is not a task for 
philosophers. However, it is their task, 
and an inexhaustible task, indeed – 
to develop philosophical ethics, i.e. to 
put forth philosophical knowledge of 
the human ethical phenomenon. 
We can force people to behave 
according to norms, but we cannot 
force them to act ethically, i.e. to treat 
others as ends in themselves and not 
only as means to an end. To act ethi-
cally, individuals have to come to grips 
with themselves, through knowledge 
of philosophical ethical values. One 
of the aims of philosophical educa-
tion should be to help people do so. 
Philosophy needs to provide clear 
concepts and knowledge of ethical 
values for mankind, so that individuals 
become able to grasp the problems 
in what is going on in the world, re-
flect on the problems and, if they can 
manage it, take ethical decisions and 
act ethically.

Mohammed Arkoun (Algeria).
Philosophical thought and religious 
thought have a long history in com-
mon in the Mediterranean world. 
Since they emerged respectively 
in Greece and in the Middle East, 
they have affronted, confronted 
and enriched each other. The ex-
changes and tensions between 
them continue to this day, but there 
are nonetheless signs of exhaustion 
versus the triumphant free market 
and computer civilization. 
Concerning exchange, the two 
great philosophical bodies of 
knowledge, the Platonic and the 
Aristotelian, were key for the con-
struction of Jewish, Christian and 
Islamic theologies, beginning with 
the circulation of the Septuagint 
(the Greek version of the Old Tes-
tament) established between 250-
130 B.C. in Alexandrian Judaism

and the transmission in Greek of 
the Gospels deemed authentic by 
the Christian church. 
And as far as tension between 
philosophical reasoning and theo-
logical reasoning, it also marked the 
three currents of thought – Jewish, 
Christian and Islamic – as illustra- 
ted in the works of Averroes (1126-
1198), Maimonides (1135-1204) 
and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). 
In Islam, the rise of the brother-
hoods beginning in the 13th cen-
tury brought about a regression of 
theological reasoning and the elimi-
nation of the Greek philosophical 
culture. The latter is still struggling 
to get “reacclimatized”, even at 
university level. In Latin and Chris-
tian Europe, it was philosophy that 
gained ground to the point of mar-
ginalizing theology when the revo-
lution of the Enlightenment came 
about, and even more after the sep-
aration of church and secular state. 
In Christianity, theological thought 
is increasingly forced to follow in the 
wake of human and social sciences. 
This is not the case with Islam, 
where the apologetic and funda-
mentalist currents reject colonial 
and Western sciences as destruc-
tive forces against Islamic tradition. 
To the point that they espouse the 
idea of Islamizing modernity rather 
than modernizing Islam.
Marginalization  
of thought
The multiple revolutions introduced 
by computers and population 
growth in poor countries have over-
turned what sociologists call the 
social frameworks of thought and 
knowledge. Considerable gaps 
continue to widen between rich 
countries and countries left at the 
mercy of the negative side-effects 
of the free market and consumer-
ism. 
In countries under the boot of 
authoritarian, not to say rogue, re-
gimes, the return of traditional re-
ligion can be interpreted as the 
quest for refuge, social protection 
and moral and psychological refer-
ence points. Religion is a refuge, 
including for the opposition, a 
springboard to satisfying social and 
political ambition. The result is de-
terioration of spiritual values, which 
are deprived of critical cultural and 
intellectual support. 
But we can see that populist and 
superstitious religion is on the rise 
even in the richest societies, such as 
the United States. The undisputed 
victory of “tele-techno-scientific” 
reasoning reinforces the expansion 
of religiosity in rich and super-de-
veloped countries, and the margin-
alization of thought and philosophi-
cal culture. 
Recently-published statistics on 
the distribution of baccalaureate 
degrees in France show that 52% 
of the students who earned de-
grees in 2007 came from scientific 
curricula, and only 16% from literary 
education. France and Italy are the 
only two countries I know of where 
philosophy is taught in high school. 
There is as much disinterest for this 
discipline as there is for history, 
another key discipline in what 
used to be called the humanities, 
referring to culture and humanist 
comportment. According to other 
statistics from countries that are try-
ing to develop, many of the young 
people involved in Islamist com-
bat groups have scientific back-
grounds. Everywhere the state en-
courages this orientation to promote 
economic development and fight 
against unemployment.
A widening gap
As a historian of Islamic thought, 
I can testify that between 1970 
and 2000, I could measure from 
year to year at the Sorbonne the 
increasing impoverishment of his-
torical knowledge and historical, 
sociological and anthropological 
reasoning. I also noted an almost 
total lack of everything that nou- 
rishes epistemological criticism in 
the whole of scientific production. 
When this criticism does manifest 
itself, it is too technical for readers 
to feel involved. These are all fac-
tors accelerating the primacy of 
“tele-techno-scientific” education 
and the victory of the knowledge 
of experts versus humanist con-
cerns that are inseparable from 
philosophical disquiet. 
It is true that most professionals 
in philosophy don’t offer writing 
that is easily accessible to the 
general public. Those who do are 
treated condescendingly by the 
guardians of philosophical gravi-
tas. The conferences in which 
I’ve taken part at UNESCO and 
elsewhere have led me to feeling 
certain that the gap between the 
general public’s expectations and 
innovative philosophical produc-
tion is more likely to get wider than 
narrower in the near future. This 
observation applies just as much 
to pragmatic cultures as it does 
to societies that are the victims of 
the rise of ritualistic religions with 
populist tendencies.

thought, teaches at the Sorbonne

I Dialogue is not just  
an exchange of ideas
Philosophers need to argue not 
only the necessity for dialogue but 
also explain its nature. Dialogue is 
not just the exchange of ideas. A 
quarrelling group may be actively 
exchanging ideas, but will be far 
from dialogue; so would a group 
indulging in mutual admiration. In 
both cases the discussions are 
not dedicated to acquiring knowl-
edge about truth or goodness for 
the sake of desirable human rela-
tions. These, then, are necessary 
conditions of dialogue. But there 
are other necessary conditions. 
Dialogue must be based on ratio-
nal discussion. Such a discussion 
is impossible unless the parties 
acknowledge the possibility that 
they might be wrong and the other 
right. We all know this attitude of 
mind does not come easily. 
One of the severest impediments 
deally, philosophy is both a criti-
cal and reconstructive discipline. 
Being critical does not just mean 
being apt to criticize the beliefs 
and reasonings of other people; 
it also means being self-critical, in 
dialogue with oneself. This implies 
also being in dialogue with others, 
be they members of one’s culture 
or one’s school of thought or of oth-
er cultures or schools of thought. 
In today’s world, dialogue be-
tween people of different cultures 
and schools of thought is an ur-
gent necessity. Dialogue is need-
ed not necessarily to bring about 
agreement but at least to bring 
about an understanding of the 
plurality of belief and non-belief 
and respect (not just tolerance) 
for them in principle. Just think of 
the consequences of the absence 
of dialogue in international and 
intra-national conflicts in the world 
today.
to dialogue is dogmatism, and it is, 
or ought to be, the role of philoso-
phers to find an antidote to it. Dog-
matism is not just holding a belief 
with a strong conviction; rather it 
is holding it with a conviction so 
strong that it rules out the possibil-
ity of error. It can be encountered 
in all spheres of human thinking, 
including philosophy (in the broad 
acceptation of this term). And rid-
ding human thought of dogmatism 
is one of philosophy’s objectives, 
in the strict conception of the dis-
cipline.
An antidote  
to dogmatism
As matters stand now, conflict-
ing dogmatisms fight interminably. 
When, for example, contending 
parties armed with mutually incom-
patible divine ‘revelations’ as to 
the nature of the good life engage 
each other, the refractory character 
of the situation is due in large mea-
sure to a shared sense of infallibility.

                       if the logical independence of morality from religion 
             were to be generally understood, some of the ferocity of current conflicts 
                      might be reduced, says Ghanaian philosopher Kwasi wiredu.

There are at least three layers of 
error here. 
First, allegedly infallible individu-
als are not supposed to have any 
need of dialogue among them-
selves, and the fallible, presumably,

have no standing before the infal-
lible. But Philosophy has the duty 
and ability to dismantle the preten-
sions to infallibility, for the claims 
here are human, all too human. 
And the fact is that “To err is hu-
man.” 
Second, a great many of these 
conflicts arise when the contingent 
customs of one group’s life-style 
are made into universal laws of rec-
titude mandatory for all. To gene- 
rate an adequate appreciation 
of this distinction would be half 
the battle of intercultural under- 
standing won. This, to be sure, is a 
philosophical task. 
The third layer of error is the 
most difficult to deal with. It is the 
subordination of morality to religion, 
known in contemporary Western 
philosophy as the divine command 
theory of morals. In sum, it says that 
what is morally right is, by defini-
tion, what is commanded by God. 
Socrates in Plato’s Euthyphro tried 
to discourage such a conception 
by pointing out, in his dialectical 
manner, that it involved the absur-
dity that an action’s moral quality 
has nothing to do with its nature. 
On this score, Socrates has been 
generally persuasive among phi-
losophers, but not among some 
leaders of opinion. 
Even though the subordination of 
morality to religion is not unchal-
lenged in the Western world and 
is, in fact, non-existent in some 
non-Western cultures, such as in 
at least some parts of Africa, phi-
losophy still has plenty of work to 
do in this matter. Perhaps, if the 
logical independence of morality 
from religion were to be generally 
understood, some of the ferocity of 
current conflicts might be reduced.

is the worst case of obliterating 
human nature and an extreme re-

the “recovery of human nature.” 
Confucius said: “What you do not 
want done to yourself, do not do to 
others.” And Immanuel Kant said: 
“Always recognize that human in-
dividuals are ends, and do not use 
them as means to your end.” Ac-
cording to these teachings human 
nature is noble and subject to rev-
erence.
Recovering  
humanity
The secret in the recovery of hu-
man nature is evasive, as humanity 
stands somewhere between divinity 
(morality) and bestiality. It is thus 
an important task of today’s men 
and women to cast away their 
bestial (carnal) inclinations elevate 
themselves to moral characters 
and maintain balanced persona- 
lities by encouraging reflection on 
human nature. 
The philosophy of “recovering 
humanity” through nurturing mo-
rality should lead toward the road 
to global peace. Should the logic 
of a “World Citizens’ Community” 
that Kant advocated in “Perpetual 
Peace” about 200 years ago re-
main just an ideal, an eternal dream? 
There is a limit to the roles that reli-
gion and politics can play in resol- 
ving conflicts among human cultures. 
So it’s the philosophers’ role to pro-
vide solutions. They should elabo-
rate a philosophy of universality 
for global villagers to prevent war 
and to serve as the basis for indivi- 
duals’ rights. 
Therefore, the creation of world 
philosophy is more urgent than any-
thing else. It implies first of all break-
ing the wall between Eastern and 
Western philosophical traditions 
and facilitating mutual understand-
ing and communication between 
the two heterogeneous cultures. To 
give shape to “World Philosophy”, a 
proper fusion of Western and East-
ern values is necessary. In other 
words, if Western values stand for 
liberalism and individualism, Eastern 
values are closer to collectivism and 
communalism. Still, this dichotomic 
analysis can never be absolute, as 
Western values contain elements 
of Eastern values and there can be 
Western characteristics, too, within 
the components of Eastern values.
Against philosophical 
exclusivity
To resolve such cultural conflicts, 
it is first necessary to form a pan-
Asian philosophy as the premise 
for establishing World Philoso-
phy, and for this purpose, I think 
it very important for the three East 
Asian nations of China, Japan and 
Korea to pursue the integration of a 
common cultural sphere and jointly 
examine how to evaluate modern 
values contained in the heritage of 
Confucian culture, as represented 
by the teachings of Confucius and 
Mencius. 
The discussion of the Universal-
ity of Philosophy is based on the 
global village theory to form a 
global community. The progress in 
today’s information and transporta-
tion technology, and the sweeping 
wave of globalization have made 
the fences of nationalism and re-
gionalism not tenable any longer. 
Philosophy must adapt to the new 
information society and the pursuit 
of cultural globalization and univer-
sality should emerge as the grand 
proposition that brings together 
today’s philosophies, a prerequi-
site for the birth of the Universality 
of Philosophy. 
The role of the Universality of 
Philosophy will be to seek, above 
all, harmony and unity that enable 
humans to escape from cultural 
antagonism and conflicts as well 
as to avoid philosophical, religious 
and cultural exclusiveness in their 
search of universality amid cultural 
diversity.

100th anniversary  
of the birth of theodor Adorno 
(1903-1969) 
German philosopher, sociologist, com-
poser and musicologist, Theodor Lud-
wig Wiesengrund-Adorno was one of 
the first to think about the memory of 
Auschwitz as a fundamental element 
of German identity, and even European 
identity. Nazism, he said, imposed a new 
categorical imperative on humanity: to 
think and to act so that Auschwitz would 
not repeat itself, so that nothing similar 
could happen.” 
1000th anniversary  
of the birth of nasir Khusraw 
(1003-1087) 
Abu Mo’in Hamid ad-Din Nasir ibn Khus-
raw al-Qubadiani (Iran) or Abdulmuiddin 
Nosiri Khosrav (Tajikistan), eminent 
philosopher, poet and theologian in the 
Persian language, produced more than 
40 treatises that exerted great influ-
ence on Persian culture and thought. 
His most famous work is “Safarnama”, or 
“Book of Travels.” In the book, which has 
been translated into over 30 languages, 
Nasir Khusraw describes the places he 
visited (Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, etc) 
and portrays the people he met, against 
a background of philosophical, religious 
and humanist reflection. 
900th anniversary  
of the birth of Khodja Abdulk-
holiq Al-Gijduvoni  
(1103-1079) 
Khodja Abdulkholiq Al-Gijduvoni, founder 
of the Sufi school Khodjagons Tarigot 
(dervish path) in Central Asia, is famous 
for having taught the ways of tolerance 
and peace. His writings include philo-
sophical and moral works as well as poetry. 
He was born and lived in Bukhara, 
Uzbekistan.
sophy to the theatre, Danzanravjaa Duldu-
itiin exerted an important influence on 
thought and culture, well beyond the bor-
ders of Mongolia. After studying art, letters 
and philosophy, he took up residence in the 
1820s in the Galbyn Uul monastery, which 
became a local centre for education, culture 
and art. He also founded a theatre troupe, a 
library and a school in the Khamar monas- 
tery, near which now stands a museum 
commemorating him. 
200th anniversary  
of the death of immanuel Kant 
(1724-1804) 
A major 18th century philosopher, Imman-
uel Kant is a pillar of Western philosophy. 
A disciple of Hume and Rousseau, he 
wrote notably “Answering the Question: 
What is Enlightenment?” in which he wrote 
“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from 
self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity and 
dependence are the inability to use one’s 
own intellect without the direction of an-
other. One is responsible for this immaturity 
and dependence, if its cause is not a lack 
of intelligence, but a lack of determination 
and courage to think without the direction 
of another. Sapere aude! Dare to know! is 
therefore the slogan of the Enlightenment.”
600th anniversary  
of leone battista Alberti  
(1404-1472) 
An Italian Renaissance humanist, Leone 
Battista Alberti was an author, philosopher, 
painter, architect and art theoretician. He is 
known primarily for his treatises, including De 
picture (1435), considered the first scientific 
study of perspective. Giorgio Vasari, author 
of Vite, the first art history work in 
Europe, wrote in 1550 about Alberti that he 
was a highly civilized and very cultured per-
son, a friend to the talented, affable and 
liberal towards all: he lived honorably as 
the gentleman he was.
