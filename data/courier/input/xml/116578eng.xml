2 1 Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
More and more tourists are visiting monuments and
exploring different ways of life. In some cases, the boom
in tourism can reinvigorate local traditions. In others,
tourist overload is clearly harming host communities.
Should culture be protected from tourism? What can be
done to foster a mutually beneficial relationship 
between the two?

Dire poverty has driven some five million Bangladeshis to migrate to “ c h a r s ” , islands that are
periodically submerged by the country’s mighty rivers
Newly emerged grazing land on the north side of Sandwip island in the Bay of Bengal.

c o u rse constantly, and we aves around the
innumerable chars, d e t e rmining all aspects
of life on these islands. In March and A p ri l
the Jamuna is almost dry,whereas from June
o n wards the flood season starts and the
water level can rise as much as six metres.T h e
average life span of a char is from 10 to 25
ye a rs. Once a c h a r is submerged, p e o p l e
settle down on the neighbouring islands and
wait for the water to recede. But if the char
is fully eroded, months or ye a rs may pass
before they can go back to it.
Paying taxes
on underwater land
In some cases it was several generat i o n s
ago that the poorest of the poor fled the
mainland and opted for a no less uncert a i n
existence on the chars. “Land is fresh and
f e rtile on the char. The harvest is better
than on the mainland,” s ays Keru Ta l u k d a r ,
a peasant now settled on the island of Ruli-
para in Tangail distri c t , central Bangladesh.
There are no precise statistics on the
char population of Bangladesh. So preca-
rious is the fate of the chars that there is
usually no post offic e , health centre or eve n
e l e c t ricity on any of these islands.The char-
d we l l e rs depend on boats to commute to the
mainland, which can be between two and
eight kilometres away.
For the char people, land is the main

I am 95.I was born on this char. When I was a
child many trees grew on the char and it was
like the mainland.I went to school naked. We
did not wear as many clothes as today;habits
were different. The char was eroded when I was
between 5 and 7.Since then I have moved my
home more than 7 times. The char was more
stable when I was young. Until I was 45, I
moved only twice. When I was living in the
shade of my father, life was very easy. But when
I started to live alone, life became very tough.

resource but it has no permanent bounda-
ri e s. They keep property title deeds and
even pay taxes for land under water in the
hope of cultivating it again one day, once the
island re-emerges. Since there is no admi-
n i s t r ation on the islands, the char-dwe l l e rs
settle land disputes among themselve s. O n
the Jamuna ri ve r , they even sell and bu y
land under water in the hope that it will sur-
face again. For example, the char of Ruli-
para re-emerged 25 years ago and people
continue to live there today.
Human live s ,h owe ve r , are rarely lost on
c h a rs along the Ja m u n a , unlike those on
the coastal belt, because dwe l l e rs can fore-
cast floods several days in advance by obser-
ving weather conditions. The char people
constantly keep monitoring the water leve l
and when the ri ver starts to rise during the
monsoon season they leave the islands with
their belongings and return only after the
water recedes.
‘Apart from the cyclones,
life is sweet on the chars’
Children and the elderly are part i c u-
larly vulnerable during these times, as pro-
blems of storing and cooking food, and of
d rinking wat e r , can lead to malnutri t i o n
and diarrhoea.The dry season also brings
t r o u b l e : a large part of the ri ver dries up, a n d
t r avelling between chars or to the main-
land becomes extremely difficult over the
sandy ri ve r b e d . The char-dwe l l e rs must
walk as many as eight kilometres carrying
their produce under the scorching sun. B u t
the char people accept loss and uncert a i n t y
as part of their live s. “When at last our
houses become decent and the land grows
f e rt i l e , erosion comes and we have to begi n
all over again,” explains Hayat u n , a wo m a n
from Rulipara char.
For those living on chars in the Bay of
Bengal, the threat comes from the nearby
s e a .B e t ween 1960 and 1992 no fewer than
12 cyclones devastated the coastal region.
The most tragic were in 1970 and 1991
killing respectively 300,000 and 138,000
people.But the char-dwellers take the risk
because “The air is healthy.There is enough
room to breed cattle.In one year I can eat
more fish here than during a whole life on
the mainland. A p a rt from the cy c l o n e s ,l i f e
is sweet on the chars ,” s ays Fazlur Rahman
who lives on the Dhal char, one of the
outermost islands of the Bay of Bengal. n

On Bhola island we were landless.
A landlord from our locality, Osmanganj,settled
us on Patila Char 20 years ago. Here our
homestead was eroded four times. We lost many
trees from erosion. The sea is very near now and
I am afraid of the high tide when it rolls. It
sounds like a bellowing buffalo. In the 1991
cyclone I sheltered on an artificially raised
mound where a land-owner kept his buffalos.
We had to survive on wet rice and fruits of
kaora trees. We didn’t have a fire until the local
official sent one of his men to bring us a flame.
It was a hard struggle to keep the fire alive.

covered with trees and a type of grass called
catkin;there were wild animals. British people
came to hunt on the char. They stayed in
temporary camps.
Because of erosion I have shifted my home
more than 10 times. I remember that during my
childhood harvests were good. There was
happiness and peace on the chars. Now, there is
nothing.Before, there were rich and poor people
too, but the poor had,at least, some way of

w The year 2000 must be a new beginning for us all. Together we can transform the
culture of war and violence into a culture of peace and non-violence.This transforma-
tion demands the participation of each and every one of us. It must offer young people
and future generations the values that can inspire them to shape a world based on jus-
tice, solidarity, liberty, dignity, harmony and prosperity for all.The culture of peace can
underpin sustainable development, environmental protection and the well-being of
each person.
w In November 1997, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed the year
2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace. UNESCO is responsible for co-
ordinating the activities of the Year worldwide.
w A group of Nobel Peace Laureates who met in Paris to celebrate the 50th anniver-
sary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights drafted Manifesto 2000 for a
Culture of Peace and Non-Violence1. Made public in Paris on March 4, 1999, the
Manifesto is open to signature by people all over the world.The goal is to present 100
million signatures to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000.
w Manifesto 2000 for a culture of peace and non-violence
Recognizing my share of responsibility for the future of humanity, especially for the
children of today and tomorrow, I pledge in my daily life, in my family, my work, my
community, my country and my region, to:
–1 Respect all life. Respect the life and dignity of every person without discrimina-
tion or prejudice.
–2 Reject violence. Practise active non-violence, rejecting violence in all its forms:
physical, sexual, psychological, economic and social, in particular towards the most
deprived and vulnerable such as children and adolescents.
–3 Share with other s. Share my time and material resources in a spirit of generosity
to put an end to exclusion, injustice and political and economic oppression.
–4 Listen to understand. Defend freedom of expression and cultural diversity, giving
preference always to dialogue and listening without engaging in fanaticism, defa-
mation and the rejection of others.
–5 Preser ve the planet. Promote consumer behaviour that is responsible and deve-
lopment practices that respect all forms of life and preserve the balance of nature
on the planet.
–6 Redisco ver solidarity . Contribute to the development of my community, with the
full participation of women and respect for democratic principles, in order to crea-
te together new forms of solidarity.

12 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 1999
P L A N E T
n
Moved by the human tragedy of war,
we often overlook one of the other
major casualties—the env i r o n m e n t
a n d , more specifically, a gri c u l t u r e . G l o-
b a l l y, the number of armed conflicts has
been rising steadily since 1945, r e a c h i n g
an estimated 30 major and 80 to 100 minor
conflicts today.
Unlike high-tech wa rs involving we l l -
armed industrial countries,many of these
conflicts are low-intensity insurrections in
rural areas, where farmers are the victims.
Here, directly or indirectly, local seed sys-
tems may come under stress or even col-
lapse. Apart from jeopardizing immediate
food needs, the very sustainability of local
agriculture can be threatened,with poten-
tially serious consequences for the va riety of
genetic resources.
B i o d i ve rsity is often assessed in terms of
the number of existing species. B u t , at least
for crop plants, the genetic va ri ation within
species is equally import a n t . A l t h o u g h
there are half a million flowe ring plant spe-
cies, (only half of which have been named
and descri b e d ) , 95 per cent of human calo-
rie and protein requirements come from a
mere 30 of the 7,000 edible plant species
t h at humans plant or collect. And more
than half the global energy intake comes
from just three major crops—ri c e , w h e at
and maize. Genetic va ri ation enables fa r-
m e rs and agricultural scientists to conti-
nue to adapt these key crops to changing
circumstances—critical for our long-term
survival.According to the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nat i o n s
(FAO), there are as many as 100,000 dis-
tinct varieties of Asian rice (Oryza sativa)
alone.
But what happens to seed systems when
they are repeatedly disrupted by war? Far-
m e rs use several kinds of seed from
different sources.They are mainly va ri e t i e s
taken from their previous harve s t s , a d a p-
ted to local conditions and managed over
m a ny generat i o n s , or seeds from other
regions obtained through small local mar-
kets or by exchange. Fa rm e rs also use va ri e-
ties developed by research in national or
m u l t i n ational centres and purchased
annually through formal supply networks.
Vulnerable 
local seed varieties
Conflict affects the supply of these
kinds of seeds in different ways—and with
different long-term consequences for bio-
diversity. For the formal (non-local) varie-
t i e s , the supply of seed may dry up in times
of conflict, for example because transport
routes are disrupted, or because the pesti-
cides and fertilizers needed to grow these
varieties have become unavailable.This is
what happened in Rwanda, when the for-
mal potato system stopped functioning
c o u n t rywide around 1991-1992—although
direct combat only spread two years later.
U s u a l l y, when peace return s , t h e s e
f o rmal va rieties become available once
again and there are few new va ri e t a l
c o n c e rn s. The war in Bosnia caused a
b r e a k d own in the supply of crops. But it
now appears that there were relatively few
a d ve rse genetic consequences. This is
because fa rm e rs were using regi s t e r e d
va rieties supplied through formal channels.
Registered seeds are likely to be backed up
in collections in a number of countries. A
m u l t i n ational seed business caught in a wa r
zone simply withdraws for the time being
and continues its business elsewhere,with
its seed collections intact.
More vulnerable in the long term are
the local va ri e t i e s. These may be ancient
va ri e t i e s , often unrecorded and at the heart
of complex social interactions. Local or fa r-
mer-managed seed systems tend to be
decentralized and small scale. The seeds
can be obtained from small open markets,
or as the currency of gift-giving, loans and
exchange among people with firm social
bonds.
In many A f rican countri e s , up to 90 per
cent of the seeds planted in any normal ye a r

comes from informal sources. Even where
purchase (for example, from local mer-
chants) is an important part of an inform a l
seed system, it is rarely backed up by the
kind of specialist seed research fa c i l i t i e s
found in more developed economies. I n
war-affected Sierra Leone, for example, a
recent study showed that the informal sys-
tem was responsible in normal ye a rs for
about 80 per cent of seed supply for the
main staple, ri c e . Most informal transac-
tions were fa rm e r - t o - fa rm e r , in the form of
gi f t s , p u r c h a s e s , and loans. In Rwa n d a ,
Burundi and Zaire, before their respective
wars, over 95 per cent of bean seeds, their
main protein source, came from informal
seed systems.
When rural communities are forced to
fle e , the fine web of mutual seed support is
w r e c k e d . Refugee fa rm e rs no longer have
the means to repay at harvest the seeds they
b o rr owed from fellow - fa rm e rs in the plan-
ting season, so the system breaks dow n .
Without the security of peace, rural com-
munities cannot hold the markets to bu y
and sell seed. And fa rm e rs no longer know
t h at what they plant can indeed be harve s-
ted in four, nine or 18 months’ time (the
cycles of beans, p o t atoes and cassava , r e s-
p e c t i ve l y ) . Seed may be totally lacking, o r
fa rm e rs may be unable to access it, b e c a u s e
social ties are ru p t u r e d , or because they are
just too poor. In some cases, fa rm e rs under
fire may have stored appropri ate seed, bu t
simply cannot plant it. A l t e rn at i ve l y, s e e d
m ay be ava i l a b l e , but of poor quality.
Genetic loss, then, is most likely when
conflict is concentrated in remote ru r a l
areas,where it is fairly widespread geogra-
phically, and when it lasts for several years
in succession.This was the case in Angola
and Mozambique,where isolated and vul-
nerable rural populations lost many plan-
ting seasons.War has affected fourteen A f ri-
can countries during the 1990s,with rural
p o p u l ations most heavily dependent on
locally adapted seeds being the major
casualties.
Some countries are especially rich in
local va rieties and the wild relat i ves of crop
species. The breakdown of local seed sys-
tems in these countries can cause irrever-
sible damage to the global genetic resources
of food crops. For example,major wars in
Guinea Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone,
along with lesser insurrections in Casa-
mance (Senegal) and Guinea have affected

So what can be done to offset this kind
of genetic disaster? During the T i gr e a n
c o n flicts in the nort h e rn highlands of Ethio-
p i a , t h at lasted on and off for two decades,
community elders organized emergency
seed banks of maize, s o r g h u m ,w h e at ,b a r-
l e y, finger millet and teff—an annual gr a s s
gr own for its gr a i n . This was mostly to
i m p r ove the deteri o r ating seed quality,
r ather than because of short supply. I n
E t h i o p i a , a country with rich local va ri e t i e s ,
plant scientists have invested in crop gene-
tic resource conservation and in unders t a n-
ding the impact of war and drought on seed
s u p p l y.
I r o n i c a l l y, h u m a n i t a rian agencies often
make the situation wo rs e , by responding to
seed system breakdown by supplying far-
mers with seed from outside the country:
Giving “seed and tools” is the standard
second relief response after food.Seed aid
is usually “exotic”, not tested or suited to
local conditions and is alien to the cultural
management practices of farmers.
In some countries there are nat i o n a l
e f f o rts to restore crop dive rsity lost due to
wa r. I n t e rn ational A gricultural Research
Centres have been restoring bean and sorg-
hum genetic mat e rial to gene banks in wa r -
t o rn Rwanda and Buru n d i , local va rieties of
b a r l e y,d u rum wheat and bread wheat to Eri-
trea and rice seeds to institutes in the
trouble-spots of Liberia and Guinea Bis-
sau—and even Cambodia. All these coun-
t ries lost their centralized gene bank stocks,
although it is not known if there was any loss
of dive rsity at fa rm leve l .
To reinforce this kind of wo r k , s o m e
r e gi o n s , such as the West A f rican zone of
ancient rice cultivat i o n , will need specialist
missions to rescue and conserve endange-
red local va ri e t i e s.This will mean gat h e ri n g
information on cultural and farming prac-
tices,too.War threatens not only seeds but
also the knowledge that fa rming popula-
tions possess about how, where and when
to use locally-adapted local varieties.
It is difficult to estimate the true scale of
crop biodive rsity loss in wa r - t o rn regi o n s.
For several decades, small fa rm e rs have
gi ven oral accounts of significant va riety loss.
It is only now, with the development of bio-
t e c h n o l o gi e s , t h at plant scientists have the
tools to measure genetic losses precisely. n
I r o n i c a l l y, humanitarian agencies often make 
the situation worse, by responding to seed system 
breakdown by supplying farmers with seed 
from outside the country

“I grabbed the basket we used for sto-
ring beans and maize, threw in a
couple of blankets and some nappies
and put one of my children in it,” said a
44-year-old peasant woman. “I hoisted
another child on my shoulders and tied a
piece of rag to a third and kept him in
front of me. I was carrying another child
in my belly. We had to spend the night in
the forest. I was knee deep in mud and
the kids were up to their eyes in it.”1
Similar tragic stories could be told by
thousands of Colombian families who are
being forced to abandon their homes
because of civil war, which is mainly
being fought between paramilitary forces
and guerrillas. Since 1985, forced popula-
tion movement has affected 1.5 million
(308,000 in 1998) of the country’s 38
million people. More than two-thirds of
the refugees are from the countryside.
“People leave because they can no
longer live off the land,” said Hernán
Henao, director of the Regional Studies
Institute at the University of Antioquia, a
few days before he was murdered on May
4 1999. “Armed groups use intimidation,
threats and massacres to stop the peasants
going to the villages to buy and sell.” One
by one, in families or in groups, people
are fleeing the countryside. Many die on
the road. Most end up in the poverty-
stricken outskirts of the cities. Only five
per cent organize themselves into new
“resettlement” communities or return to
their land.
As farmers leave the countryside,local
food production comes to a halt.
Swissaid,a Swiss non-governmental orga-
nization working with displaced commu-
nities, the Diocese of Apartadó and the
International Red Cross, is trying to res-
tore this production, especially in the
Urabá region, one of the hotspots of the
civil war. The first priority is to guarantee
food security by collecting seeds of basic
foodstuffs lost during the war.The second
C O L O M B I A :
THE SEEDS OF RETURN
w Leticia Reyes
As terror and death stalk rural Colombia, preserving biodiversity is a priority for the food security
of displaced communities
is to re-establish family plots, which are
traditionally tended by the womenfolk
and where a wide variety of crop species
are grown.
The Indians,
guardians of biodiversity
Participants in the programme start
by making an inventory of lost varieties
and then go looking for them in nearby
villages. If there has been a massive exo-
dus of people,there will be no neighbours
and therefore no seeds. The job then
becomes harder. “In an area where eve-
ryone has left, you can lose a variety that
a community has been using for centu-
ries,” says Hans Wiederkehr, Swissaid’s
representative in Colombia. A lot also
depends on how long the population dis-
placement lasts. “ N o rth of the Rive r
Atrato, for example, not a single one of
the 47 known rice varieties identified
there were left when people returned to
the area a year later.This was long enough
for rice,maize,bean and plant seeds to be
lost, because their germination period
varies between three and six months.
Yucca and plantain seeds, however, can
survive for about two years.”
But how can people recuperate the
seeds when they live in an atmosphere of
fli g h t , f e a r , t h r e ats and death? “ W h at
we’re doing can only succeed because the
communities retain a basic capacity for
self-management,” said Wiederkehr. “In
this sense, the contribution of the Indians
(who were living in the region when the
Spaniards came), has been crucial becau-
se they’ve turned themselves into what
you might call ‘guardians of biodiversity’.
For more than 500 years, the Indians
have lived like nomads, so they’re very
good at organizing themselves and resis-
ting.”
In early 1995, for example, all the 700
or so people in the Zenú Indian village of
El Volao in Uraba left the protected zone.
In the second half of that ye a r , S w i s s a i d

S O M A L I A’S BITTER HARV E S T
w Dan Kiambi
An ambitious international project to maintain crop variety in a war-torn country
In 1989 a scientist travelled from Somalia to Ke n ya
with a precious cargo in his luggage—a complete
duplicate set of the 284 samples of sorghum and
maize genetic material from Somalia’s Baidoa/Afgoi
gene bank. His destination was the Ke n ya National
G e n e b a n k , where the collection would be conserved
along with 27,000 samples of genetic material from
a wide range of crops.
At the time the scientist could not know just
how important this trip was to be. Two years later,
a civil war broke out in Somalia.It is still not over,
and one of its casualties has been the
Baidoa/Afgoi research and conservation centre.
The entire gene bank of local plant crop varieties
has been wiped out.
According to a survey carried out in 1996-97, t h e
continued state of unrest in Somalia not only seve-
rely damaged farm production,but also led to the loss
of some local crop species altogether.This is why the
duplicate collection held in Ke n ya became so impor-
t a n t . In 1996, with funding from the European
U n i o n , through the Somalia Office in Nairobi, i n
c o l l a b o ration with Co-operazione Italiana Nord-Sud
(CINS) and the National Genebank of Kenya,scien-
tists from the International Plant Genetic Resources
Institute (IPGRI) embarked on an ambitious project.
They would reproduce crop seed material from the
genetic samples stored in Ke n ya and repatriate it to
Somalia for planting.
The project concentrated on the Middle
Shebelle, a fertile flood plain in Somalia, covering
the three districts of Balaad, Bulu Burti and
Jowhar. Researchers assessing the effects of the
war found that farmers there had access to a very
limited number of crop varieties. Seeds were often
scarce and of low quality. Hungry families, too
poor to buy new seed, were eating the very seed
stocks they were hoping to plant for food.The war
had destroyed irrigation systems, as well as crucial
farming equipment including milling machines,
water pumps and tractors.
After consultations with local administra t o r s,
farmers and NGOs working in the area, p r o j e c t
scientists introduced 151 sorghum and 14 maize
samples that had previously been multiplied gene-
tically by the National Genebank of Ke n ya and air-
freighted to the project site. The materials were
supplied to 90 farmers for on-farm trials in nine dif-
ferent villages, three in each district. A parallel on-
station trial was set up at the CINS project site at
D e g a n l e y, in Balaad, for comparison.
After about a year, farmers had selected 13
varieties out of the 165 samples for further trials.
If the farmers were happy with the results, they
would adopt them as part of their farming practi-
ce. The project also set up a new gene bank of
over 240 samples of the reintroduced seed mate-
rial at Deganley, just in case.
But disaster struck again. Rival factions of the
Somali warlords attacked the base at Deganley and
destroyed the new gene bank, including some mate-
rial collected in Somalia during the project. Th e
a t t a c kers stole the centre’s computer with all the data
and software. They also held one CINS expatriate
scientist captive for three days before releasing him.
In November 1997, following this attack, the
project terminated its activities in Somalia. It was
not possible to follow up the on-farm trials to see
how farmers got on with the 13 selected elite
plant varieties. But the results already looked pro-
mising and farmers have the seeds. With luck,the
best ones will filter into the farming systems in the
course of time and help re-diversify the genetic
base of sorghum and maize, if not in the project
site, then elsewhere in Somalia. n

plants gr ow in the vegetable gardens ten-
ded by the wo m e n . Some of them, i n c l u-
ding chillies, sweet potat o, basil and
pigeon peas, possess considerable genetic
d i ve rs i t y.
Recuperating all the seeds is very dif-
ficult. The project’s promoters say the
Colombian gove rn m e n t ’s short - t e rm
humanitarian aid policies often hamper
efforts to preserve and restore biodiversi-
ty. “The authorities offer ‘improved’seeds
and animal va rieties without thinking
about the harm they might do to local
genetic biodive rs i t y, and especially
without taking into account the knowled-
ge accumulated by local people over the
centuries,” says Swissaid’s Germán Vélez.
“They also encourage the intensive use of
c h e m i c a l s , marketing techniques and
one-crop farming ,” he adds.
The projects have developed in very
different ways depending on whether they
involve people returning to their own
land—as the Zenú Indians did—or going
to “temporary settlements” far from their
original homes, as in the case of the
region’s black communities.The situation
of the latter is very precarious. For them,
public services, including health, are vir-
tually non-existent and food is scarce.But
these communities, descended from esca-
ped slaves (maroons), are good at organi-
zing themselves.
Preservation of biodiversity 
hangs by a thread
At the end of 1998, 3,500 A f r o -
Colombian peasants, refugees in the tow n
of Pava r a n d ó , began talks with gove rn-
ment officials to fund their return home.
Since then, they have launched a “ Fo o d
S e c u ri t y ” p r o gramme with support from
S w i s s a i d . The menfolk go to nearby com-
munities in search of seeds, while the
women distri bute them to the ve g e t a b l e
g a r d e n s , identify medicinal plants and
exchange know - h ow.The women know all
about crop cy c l e s , soil quality and espe-
cially the needs of the fa m i l y. S e veral food
crops have already been harvested thanks
to teamwork and preparat o ry wo r k s h o p s.
Committees have also been set up to look
after seed storage. But the security situa-
tion is ve ry serious—12 peasants we r e
murdered by a group of paramilitaries on
A p ril 7 1999—and leaving the settlements
is become increasingly dangerous.
The fact is that in Colombia preserva-
tion of biodive rsity hangs by a thread.
W h at ’s more, both Indians and peasants
h ave only ve ry slender chances of being
able to return for good to their land (their
rights to which were recognized in 1993)
and reclaim their dignity in a country
where fundamental rights are violated on
a daily basis and where violence is des-
t r oying the links between land, c o m m u n i-
ties and traditional resources. M e a n w h i l e ,
it is reckoned that eve ry hour, o n e
Colombian family is being forced to leave
their home. H ow long can this go on? n

and more resilient to the type of fin a n c i a l
shock which has left the region reeling
from recession.

leading to the biggest shake-up of the edu-

Southeast Asia’s booming economy for decades masked deficiencies in educational systems. But
now, in the wake of financial crisis, the region is bent on getting smarter faster
launching its first computerized “ s m a rt
s c h o o l s ” .And Singapore has begun a cam-
paign to teach innovative thinking.
Despite differences among the Sou-
theast Asian countries,a few main threads
run throughout their approaches. F i rs t ,
these countries recognize the need for a
quantum leap in basic education and skills
standards in order for the labour force to
regain competitiveness. Second, rote lear-
ning is giving way to a new call for creative
t h i n k i n g . F i n a l l y, in Thailand and Indo-
n e s i a ,a u t h o rity over curricula and spending
is being decentralized to make education
more responsive to local needs.
Even before the crisis,it was clear edu-
c ational systems in many cases were laggi n g
behind economic development in Southeast
A s i a . For three decades these countries had
ridden the crest of export - o riented eco-
nomic growth. An important pillar of the
gr owth was cheap, unskilled labour.
H owe ve r , in recent ye a rs countries like
China,Viet Nam and India have undercut
the cost of labour in Southeast A s i a .This left
Southeast Asia less competitive in prov i-
sion of bargain-priced labour for basic
manufacturing. Meanwhile,skills training
was not keeping pace with the global
market,making it difficult for these coun-
t ries to compete in high added value indus-
tries such as information technology (IT).

average in practice of 5.3 ye a rs.
During the 30 years up to the financial
c risis that began in July 1997, as per capita
gross domestic product quadrupled in real
t e rm s ,p ri m a ry school enrolment grew from
around 70 per cent to 90 per cent.
Secondary school enrolment rose from 40
per cent to over 70 per cent.
But fundamental problems have pers i s t e d
with the education system, in which one in
e ve ry four children aged between six and 17 is
still not in school, and modes of teaching
appear increasingly outdat e d . Rote learn i n g
p r e vails and to the minds of altern at i ve
e d u c ationalists in T h a i l a n d , this cultivat e s
obedience to authority rather than stimulat i n g
independent thought. Most critically in the

is under-qualified and lacks technical
e x p e rt i s e .

technology-based era.“We were reliant on

of non-formal education development.
According to a 1996 gove rnment surve y,
t h r e e - q u a rt e rs of the workforce aged over 21
ye a rs had no secondary educat i o n . At the
upper end of the educational scale there wa s
a dearth of intern ational-standard science
dragged their feet about addressing the
d e fic i e n c i e s. It was easier to put off much-
needed reforms then because the economies
were gr owing quickly, overall standards of
living were improving and there was little
pressure on gove rnments to undert a k e
i m p o rtant reform .M a l aysia and Singapore
h ave generally been forward-looking when
it comes to educat i o n .The fallout of the cri s i s
has increased their resolve to develop eve n
more sophisticated educational systems.

and economic models,” s ays Professor S.
G o p i n at h a n ,S i n g a p o r e ’s National Institute

capital and markets. But the new economic
paradigm will be value-added in an entirely
different kind of way : the ability to use
knowledge and data.”
In Thailand an ambitious educat i o n
r e f o rm bill, which lays the foundations for
the most radical shake-up of the pedagogi c a l
system since the Bri t i s h - e d u c ated King
Rama VI (1910-25) introduced compulsory

approved by parliament.
Deputy Education Minister Somsak
P risanantakul calls it a “ t u rning point for
Thai society”, t h at will lead to less stat e

and engi n e e ring gr a d u ates coming out of a

producing gove rnment bu r e a u c r at s.
This reality, d ri ven home by the cri s i s ,
has gi ven additional impetus to the reform
b i l l , seen as the foundation for deve l o p i n g
the quality education Thailand needs.
Passed by the lower house of T h a i l a n d ’s

to standing at the front of the class and
giving a lecture,” s ays Dr. Rung Kaewdang,

M e a n w h i l e , giving more responsibility
to teachers for devising their ow n

make education more sensitive to the needs

to changes in the education system. G a i n s

state funding.According to a recent World
Bank report , e ven before the cri s i s , m a ny
schools needed books, supplies and
substantial maintenance, with gove rn m e n t
grants to pri m a ry schools amounting to less
than $0.40 per pupil per year.
The scholarship scheme has been
s u p p o rted by a major state-backed “ S t ay in
S c h o o l ”c a m p a i g n , with adve rts on TV with
the catch phrase “aku anak sekolah”—“I’m
a schoolkid.”All funds are being dispers e d ,
when possible, directly to student and
school accounts held at post offices across
the country, in a bid to cut out on
administrative overheads and “leakage”.
E d u c ation minister Juwono Sudars o n o
has conceded in a recent interview that gr a f t
is a problem—and that from 10 to 15 per
cent of the funds are likely to be written off.
C o n c e rns have also been voiced about
delays in disbursement.
The ADB is upbeat about the
s c h o l a rship scheme, which it sees as lay i n g
the gr o u n d work for a radical
d e c e n t r a l i z ation of education financing in
the future. An official monitoring report of
the scheme concluded that 81 per cent of
the $2.50 per month scholarships have
reached the poorest students in the firs t
ye a r , and virtually all have received the
correct amount of money.
G ove rnment officials sound a more
cautious note, seeing the scheme as a stop-
gap measure. But the process of
d e c e n t r a l i z ation of authority for school
budgets and management appears
i n e v i t a b l e .“ D e c e n t r a l i z ation is a must,” s a i d
Dr Indra Djati Sidi, director-general of
p ri m a ry and secondary educat i o n ,a d d i n g
t h at educational programmes devo l v i n g
more authority to districts for teacher
training and construction of schools had
actually started two ye a rs ago. “ W h at the
crisis has done is speed up the process.”
The education ministry appears set on
retaining control of the core nat i o n a l
c u rriculum and exams, but acknow l e d g e s
t h at districts have a better idea of the
e d u c ational needs of communities than
o f ficials in Ja k a rt a .The gove rnment policy
introduced in the early 1990s to allow 20 per
cent local content in the school curri c u l u m —
essential in an ethnically and geogr a p h i c a l l y
d i ve rse country of 200 million people—
remains hamstrung by a lack of local capacity
to go beyond the ri gid national curri c u l u m .
Malaysia and Singapore:
smart schools and creative kids
M a l aysia and Singapore have pressed
ahead with ambitious plans to change the
whole concept of schooling.
M a l aysia embarked this ye a r , a l b e i t
falteringly, on a “smart schools”project to
p r ovide the country with the innovat i ve IT
e x p e rts and computer-savvy wo r k e rs of
t o m o rr ow, in what the gove rnment is
touting as a unique part n e rship between the
state and private sector.
A consortium of 12 mainly
m u l t i n ational IT firms have been charged
with devising systems and software to equip
90 fully computerized schools. Some 30 per
cent of the designated schools are in ru r a l
areas.
“If we don’t go hi-tech and embrace
b r a i n - i n t e n s i ve industri e s , then Malay s i a
will be left reliant on labour-intensive
i n d u s t ri e s ,f o r e ver a developing country,”
declares Dr Rojani Abdul Hamid of the
Malaysian ministry of education
The idea is for the consortium to design
a “total solution” for computerized schools,
including electronic teaching mat e rials as
well as systems for student assessment and
a d m i n i s t r ation and management. C h i l d r e n
will be able to study at their own speed, a n d
take exams—accessed online from a
centralized database—when they are ready
t o. “ C o u rs e wa r e ” on CD Rom will be
p r ovided for four subjects: science and
t e c h n o l o g y, m at h s , English and Bahasa
M e l ayu (the national language of Malay s i a ) .
The ove rriding aim is to provide the
skills base for the planned Multimedia
Super Corri d o r , an IT industrial hub which
will stretch 50 kilometres south from the
c a p i t a l , Kuala Lumpur—the centrepiece of
Premier Mahathir Mohamad’s dri ve for
M a l aysia to achieve developed nation stat u s
by 2020.
Computer industry sources say the
economic crisis and problems of
c o o r d i n ating the pri vate sector consort i u m
has caused delays.The education ministry
has stepped into the breach, devising interi m
computer lesson plans and other teaching
m at e rials to ease the still-underequipped
schools into the IT era.
Singapore meanwhile has announced
plans to invest over $2.6 billion into bu i l d i n g
and upgrading 290 schools over the next
s e ven ye a rs , on its relentless quest to improve
an education system of already remarkable
e f fic i e n cy.The majority of children among
the Singaporean population of 3.5 million
pass through 10 ye a rs of state schooling.
But these achievements belie insecuri t y
about the innovat i ve ability of Singaporean
s t u d e n t s. Last ye a r , the NIE, which is
responsible for all teacher training, a d o p t e d
a new programme that represents a sea
change in the approach to classroom
l e a rn i n g .I t ’s called “teaching thinking” a n d
is designed to encourage what was once
taboo—students coming up with their ow n
i d e a s.
According to the NIE’s Professor
G o p i n at h a n ,Singapore has previously relied
on content mastery or the “pedagogy of the
wo r k s h e e t ” . But the global economy of the
future demands something more.“ We need
a learning environment that allows for
flexibility and collaborat i ve learn i n g,” h e
says. n
In Malaysia,schools are being equipped with computers through a state partnership with the private sector.
‘Decentralization is a must.
What the crisis has done is
speed up the process.’

T
he world’s leading category of
international tra d e, tourism is
i n c reasingly offering a range of
c u l t u ral pro d u c t s, f rom visiting
monuments to the discovery of unique
ways of life. This growing trend fuelled
by a quest for cultural enrichment can
e n c o u rage the revival of traditions and
the re s t o ration of sites and monuments.
But unbridled tourism can have the
opposite effect.
H e re there is a real dilemma. Is there
not a risk that the boom in cultura l
t o u r i s m , by the sheer weight of
n u m b e rs involved, may harbour the
seeds of its own destruction by ero d i n g
the very cultures and sites that are its
stock in tra d e ?
Our introductory section explore s

indigenous communities are doing to
c o n t rol tourism in their lands.
In Part 2 we examine the world of site

Travel and Tourism at the
University of Northumbria,UK
Is cultural tourism on 
the right tra c k ?
w M i ke Robinson
Tourism has long been assumed to promote cultural understanding and peace, but in fact 
it often chips away at cultures and leads to confli c t
Among the Toraja people of Sulawe s i ,
I n d o n e s i a , not all was going well with touri s m .
In fact, resentment became so great over the
way in which sacred funeral ceremonies were being
adapted to meet touri s t s ’ needs that in the lat e
1 9 8 0 s , a number of Toraja communities simply
refused to accept tourists.
The Toraja example highlights the dilemma that
faces contemporary cultural touri s m . On the one
hand tourists increasingly seek exotic and often
unique cultural spectacles and experi e n c e s , and are
willing to pay a premium to do so. But on the other
h a n d , the ve ry presence of tourists can chip away at
local culture and essentially re-invent it to fit the
exigencies of the tourism industry.
The result is that host communities find culture
and traditions under threat from the purchasing
p ower of the tourism industry. Neither are touri s t s
better off from the cultural viewpoint. Instead of
getting rich and authentic cultural insights and
e x p e ri e n c e s ,t o u rists get s t a ge d a u t h e n t i c i t y ;i n s t e a d
of getting exotic culture,they get kitsch.
With nearly one billion intern ational trips expected
in 2000, the impact of tourism on culture has become
so palpable that the question arises as to whether or
not we can continue along the current path without
something having to gi ve . More than eve r , we must
find a way to achieve sustainable cultural touri s m .
S u rp ri s i n g l y, and in contrast to the attention gi ve n
to the natural environment in the sustainable
d e velopment debat e , ve ry little energy has been
d e voted to this end.A major reason for this lethargy
a p p e a rs to lie in our basic assumptions about touri s m .
The predominant notion is that touri s m
g e n e r ates cultural harm o ny.This idea deri ves from
the romantic (and elitist) traditions of travel in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and is today
e n s h rined in the World To u rism Organizat i o n ’s
mission stat e m e n t , which includes the goal of
fostering international peace and understanding.
But claims that tourism is a vital force for peace
are exaggerat e d . Indeed there is little evidence that
t o u rism is drawing the world closer together.T h e
t ruth is that a host of cultural conflicts have
developed around tourism.
Little thought is gi ven to the fact that touri s m
is one globalizing influence which can initiat e
d r a m atic and irr e ve rsible changes within the cultures
of host communities. U n f o rt u n at e l y, while the idea
that we should respect cultures and cultural rights
m ay be present, the idea that we should s u s t a i n
cultures is not fully deve l o p e d . Nor is there any clear
indication of which cultures we are speaking of
Perhaps the most obvious conflict is betwe e n
t o u rist and host.This is in part engendered by the
fundamental difference in goals: while the touri s t
is engaged in leisure, the host is engaged in wo r k .
While the tourist arri ves with loads of expectat i o n s ,
m a ny of the local stakeholders often have no idea
of what to expect.
Another source of conflict is between the often
p e rs u a s i ve and economically powerful deve l o p e rs
and operat o rs of the intern ational (though mainly
first world) tourism industry and the host country.
To u rism can turn local cultures into commodities,
t h at is, consumer items much like any others.
R e l i gious ri t u a l s , ethnic rites and festivals continue
to be reduced and sanitized to conform with touri s t
e x p e c t at i o n s , resulting in what one scholar has
dubbed “reconstructed ethnicity.”
An unequal relationship
Pa rt of the conflict stems from the fact that
p a c k a ging culture begins well away from the cultural
s i t e . Cultures are reduced to a two - d i m e n s i o n a l
world carried by glossy brochures presenting idyllic
l o c ations and generally reducing distinctive cultures
to superficial and readily substitutable narratives.
The flow of tourism receipts is mainly to the
d e veloped world—where the majority of touri s m
businesses are locat e d — c r e ating a perm a n e n t
backdrop for conflict.
Another level of conflict is found among different
s e c t o rs of the host community. For example, l o c a l s
working in the tourism industry might have different
goals from those of agricultural wo r k e rs in the same
c o m m u n i t y. Access to tourism employ m e n t ,w h i c h
in developing countries also means often access to
r e l at i vely high wa g e s ,m ay be skewed to certain social
and ethnic groups.
The attraction of generating hard curr e n cy
r e l at i vely quickly and often with minimal inve s t m e n t
compared to, s ay, establishing a manufa c t u ri n g
i n d u s t ry, is a powerful argument for gove rn m e n t s
of both developed and developing nations seeking
to develop tourism.
H owe ve r , the va rious levels of touri s m - r e l at e d
cultural conflict force us—or should force us—to
Choose your
companions, then
choose your road.

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
question the very foundations of cultural tourism.
A c t i ve collaboration with local cultures must be at
the centre of any efforts to promote sustainable
cultural touri s m . H owe ve r , to date the extent of
c o l l a b o r ation remains narr ow and almost a token
a f t e rthought following environmental and economic
c o n s i d e r at i o n s. One study has shown that in New
Zealand Maori economic invo l vement in the touri s m
i n d u s t ry amounted to less than one per cent.
Though definitions might differ, I would argue
t h at at its heart sustainable cultural tourism recognizes
the value of cultural dive rs i t y, and needs to prov i d e
local cultures with a forum in which they can
p a rt i c i p ate in decisions that affect the future of their
c u l t u r e . In other wo r d s , host cultures should be
e m p owered to say no or yes to touri s m , and in the
l atter case, to set guidelines for tourism if they so wish.
There are examples where the redistri bution and
ow n e rship of resources are being addressed in touri s m
in such a way that indigenous peoples are begi n n i n g
to move from being the prov i d e rs of cultural
e x p e riences for touri s t s , to having an ow n e rship and
management role in touri s m . (See pages 30-33).
Such examples are encouragi n g, though still few
and far betwe e n , and even then, largely shaped by
f i rst world value systems. It is the allocation of
cultural rights and subsequent respect for and
protection of those rights which underp i n
sustainable development and should underpin the
notion of sustainable touri s m .Those cultural ri g h t s
need to be accompanied by rights in other areas.
A rmed with land, resources and intellectual propert y
ri g h t s , communities and cultures can not only
influence the direction and pace of touri s m
d e ve l o p m e n t s , but also provide or withhold consent
for them.
Except for some rare cases, I am not at all
c o n fident that at present we are on the right track
at all.The tourism industry and the gove rn m e n t s
and organizations which empower it cannot, a n d
arguably would not,engage in dramatic structural
and intellectual reshuffling which would put the
notion of cultural consent at the centre of a
collaborative process.
Under the current self-regulat o ry approach, t h e
i n d u s t ry can encourage local community
p a rt i c i p ation in the management of touri s m
resources and can aim to include non-traditional
d e c i s i o n - m a k e rs in the development process.T h e
problem is that it does things in a way that is
designed to serve both the economic goals and
desires of the tourism industry, and the dominant
first world value systems which it represents.
One of the implications of a sustainable touri s m
c o n s t ructed around the idea of cultural consent is that
t o u rism may be rejected outri g h t . More likely is that
via more equitable collaborat i o n s , the nat u r e ,e x t e n t
and type of tourism development will be adopted to
suit the cultural needs of the host community. E i t h e r
way the challenge is to establish mechanisms which
will invo l ve local cultures and transfer to them the ri g h t
to decide on the type and extent of tourism which t h e y
wish within the economic, e nvironmental and cultural
limits which they have set. n

24 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 1999
A rt , like other potent substances, should be
consumed in moderation.This conclusion is
to be drawn from the experience of the
French novelist Stendhal (Mari e - H e n ri Beyle, 1 7 8 3 -
1842) who, while visiting Florence in 1817, e m e r g e d
from the church of Santa Croce in an extremely
shaky condition.
“I was already in a kind of ecstasy,” he wrote,“ b y
the idea of being in Florence, and the neighbourhood
of the gr e at men whose tombs I had just seen.
Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty, I
s aw it in close-up, I touched it so to speak. I had
reached that point of emotion where the heave n l y
s e n s ations provided by the fine arts meet passionat e
f e e l i n g s. On leaving Santa Croce, I had palpitat i o n s ;
all the life went out of me, as I walked I was afraid I
would fa l l .”
This is the first description of what Florentine
p s y c h i at rist Graziella Magherini named “the Stendhal
s y n d r o m e ” , a profound psychological disturbance
t riggered by exposure to a work of art . Symptoms may
include dizzy spells, loss of the sense of identity and
o ri e n t at i o n , depression and even physical exhaustion.
This kind of cultural ove r d o s e , for which the only
k n own cure is rest, r e p o rtedly affects a handful of
foreign tourists in Florence each ye a r.According to
M a g h e ri n i , who has written a book on the subject,1
the ingredients are “an impressionable pers o n a l i t y,
the stress of travel and the encounter with a city like
Florence haunted by ghosts of the gr e at ,d e ath and
the pers p e c t i ve of history.”
Tourism picks up steam
The Stendhal syndrome is not the only
e x p e rience shared by modern cultural tourists and
wayfarers of the past.
In fact,there is nothing new about sightseeing.
Travel guides proliferated in Greek Antiquity, and
the Hellenistic wo r l d ’s taste for tourist at t r a c t i o n s
(m i ra b i l i a) was reflected in the invention of the Seve n
Wonders of the World.
Neither is souvenir hunting an invention of
m o d e rn trave l l e rs.The Greeks who consulted the
Oracle at Delphi or Dodona, like the medieva l
C h ristian pilgrims who trod the highways and
byways of Europe,bore relics in which there was a
profitable trade.
The dehumanizing effects of modern trave l ?
Long before cars and Concordes John Ruskin
condemned 30-m.p.h train travel as “a matter . . . to be
got through as soon as possible. It transmutes a man
from a traveller into a living parcel.” And even before
t h at ,William Wo r d swo rth had decried “ p i l grims of
fashion hurried along in their carriages”.
The tourist as a figure for satire? How about Mrs Clack
in Samuel Fo o t e ’s play A Trip to Calais ( 1 7 7 6 ) , who wa s
amazed at how well the French spoke French?
I n t e r a c t i ve tourist guides? As early as the 1840s Karl
Baedeker was urging readers of his handbooks to wri t e
in with their suggestions for future issues.
The list could go on.
Who was the first cultural tourist? Ulysses?
Alexander the Great? Julius Caesar? Perhaps they, l i k e
the Venetian merchant Marco Polo and the gr e at
voyagers of the European Renaissance who journeyed
“to make Christians and seek spices”, were essentially
business trave l l e rs.The gr e at 14th-century Arab trave l l e r
Ibn Batutah is a stronger candidate. He covered some
120,000 km in the Islamic countries and went as fa r
afield from his birt h p l a c e , Ta n gi e r , as China and
S u m at r a , “for the joy of learning about new countri e s
and new peoples”.
More recent cultural trave l l e rs were the sprigs of
the English ari s t o c r a cy who went on the Grand To u r
of continental Europe, a flexible itinerary usually
including visits to Pa ris and the main Italian cities.w UNESCO Courier journalist

July/August 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 25
Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
According to Thomas Nugent, author of The Gra n d
To u r ( 1 7 4 9 ) , this was a custom “visibly tending to
e n rich the mind with know l e d g e , to rectify the
j u d g m e n t , to remove the prejudices of educat i o n ,
to compose the outward manners , and in a wo r d
f o rm the complete gentleman”. O t h e rs we r e
sceptical about this optimistic ideology.
In the late 18th century the industrial revo l u t i o n
c r e ated a new market for trave l : i m p r oved roads
d r a m atically shortened journey times; i n d u s t ri a l
expansion generated gr e ater wealth and a new
r e s e rvoir of potential trave l l e rs in towns and cities;
t i m e - r e g u l ated forms of work brought with them the
concepts of leisure and va c at i o n .The modern touri s t
is a child of the steam age in Europe and Nort h
A m e ri c a .
S t e a m - d ri ven vessels began to link Dover and
Calais in 1821, and by 1840 an estimated 100,000
t r ave l l e rs were using them annually. In the same
year the steamship B ri t a n n i a crossed the A t l a n t i c
in 14 day s. S t e a m e rs started to ply the Rhine in
1 8 2 8 , the Rhône and the Danube a few ye a rs lat e r.
A b ove all, the spread of railway systems speeded up,
democratized and extended the range of travel.
Going by the book
The new tourists needed more guidance,
solicitude and organization than their more
independent and privileged predecessors. By the
mid-19th century a tourist industry compri s i n g
t r avel agents, g u i d e b o o k s , package tours , h o t e l s ,
r a i lways and timetables, duly emerged to prov i d e
them with protected modes of trave l .Three key
figures in this process were the British and Germ a n
p u b l i s h e rs ,r e s p e c t i vely John Murr ay (1808-1892)
and Karl Baedeker (1801-1859), and the Bri t i s h
travel agent Thomas Cook (1808-1892).
Dozens of volumes of travel writing existed to
a c c o m p a ny the Grand To u ri s t , but they had tended
to be rambling and opinionated accounts of their
authors’ own travels. For the new kind of traveller,
such idiosyncratic writings became obsolete. In the
1 8 4 0 s , they were replaced by red-covered Murr ay s
and Baedekers , which were standardized in form at ,
regularly updat e d , and designed to fit easily into
hand or pocket. B a e d e k e r , whose aim was to gi ve
t r ave l l e rs enough inform ation to dispense with paid
(human) guides, made incognito journeys to check
the reliability of his inform at i o n .He also used “ s t a rs ”
to rank sights and hotels. In fact the red guides, l i k e
some of their modern successors , h ave been
criticized for presenting a monumental heritage of
s t a rred attractions divorced from the real life of the
land and people that had created them and gave
them their meaning.
B a e d e k e r ’s publicat i o n s , which covered most of
E u r o p e , became so popular that Kaiser Wilhelm of
G e rm a ny was quoted as saying that he stat i o n e d
himself at a particular palace window each noon
because “ I t ’s written in Baedeker that I watch the
c h a n ging of the guard from that window, and the
people have come to expect it.”
The emblematic figure of a tourist industry

o p p o rtunities for people to enrich themselve s
culturally and morally by excursions to other
c o u n t ri e s. After starting out in 1841 by organizing
cheap train travel for English working men, he soon
went upmarket and by 1865 was escorting to Italy

Cook was often referred to as a gr e at general, t h e
“Napoleon of excurs i o n s ” , and military and

and administrat i ve authority in Egypt. It was said that
“the nominal suzerain of Egypt is the Sultan; its real
suzerain is Lord Cromer. Its nominal gove rnor is the

Cook and his “excursionists” were attacked by
traditionalists as hurried observe rs , v i s i b l e

will be,in the mind. n

If the World To u rism Organizat i o n ’s forecasts are
on target, i n t e rn ational tourist arri vals will climb
from the present 625 million a year to 1.6 billion
in 2020. By this dat e ,t r ave l l e rs will spend over US$2
t ri l l i o n , (against US$445 billion today ) , m a k i n g
t o u rism the wo r l d ’s leading industry. T h e s e
projections are based on annual gr owth rates of
4.3% for arri vals and 6.7% for spending, well above
the maximum expected expansion of 3% per ye a r
in world GDP. Already in 1997, t o u rism receipts
accounted for a little over 8% of the wo r l d ’s export s
in goods and almost 34% of global services export s.
Electronic technology is fa c i l i t ating this gr owth by
o f f e ring access to fare and hotel inform ation and online
r e s e rvation serv i c e s. Despite a modest annual gr ow t h
r ate (3.1%), Europe will remain, by fa r , the most
popular destination (it can expect 717 million
i n t e rn ational arri vals in 2020, double the 1998 fig u r e ) ,
though its market share will decline from 59 to 45%.
G r owth on the continent will be led by Central and
E a s t e rn European countri e s , where arri vals are
expected to increase by 4.8% per ye a r. At the same
t i m e , almost half of the wo r l d ’s tourists will be coming
from Europe.G i ven this dominance,it is not surp ri s i n g
to find that six European countries count among the
top ten tourism earn e rs and spenders.The United

With a 7% per annum growth in international
arrivals, the East Asia/Pacific region will overtake
the Americas as the second most popular destina-
tion, holding a 27% market share in 2020 against
18% by the Americas. But the industry will also be
doing its utmost to court the Asian traveller, since
East Asia /Pacific is forecast to become the world’s
second most important generator of tourists, with
a 7% annual gr owth rat e , pushing the A m e ri c a s
into third position. China is expected to become
the fourth largest source of tourists on the world
market, while it is not even among the first twenty
today. Both arrivals to and departures from Africa
(and especially Southern Africa), the Middle East
and South Asia are expected to grow by above 5%
per year.
While France has held its place as the top
d e s t i n ation throughout the 1990s, it will be
dethroned in the next decades, with China
(excluding Hong Kong) expected to top the list by
2020 even though it is not even featured on it today.
Also making an entry into the top ten are the
Russian Fe d e r at i o n , Hong Kong and the Czech
Republic.
Despite this gr owth forecast, t o u rism is and will
remain the privilege of a few:W TO forecasts that
only 7% of the world population will travel abroad
by 2020—that’s double the 1996 figure (3.5%). n

can be reve rs e d .
In the hope of increasing foreign reve n u e ,t h e
H i m a l ayan gove rnments are continuing to open
new areas to tourism each ye a r , generally without
p r o p e r l y - d e veloped management plans or any idea
of carrying capacity. Since the mid-1990s, India has
opened parts of A runachal Pradesh and new areas of
Himachal Pradesh. Nepal has permitted cross-
border trekking to Tibet on its nort h west frontier
and allowed freer access to its peripheral Buddhist
k i n g d o m s. Bhutan is the only country in the regi o n
t h at has opted for a quota system, which is in fa c t
seldom fil l e d . In a sign of further opening to foreign
v i s i t o rs , the gove rnment of Bhutan has increased
p ri vate-sector part i c i p ation in the industry, w h i l e
maintaining strict control over the sector.
In Nepal, the rapid gr owth of trekking tourism has
resulted in better internal air serv i c e s , the opening of
new local airp o rts and the building of roads, gi v i n g
large numbers of visitors access to monasteries and
r e l i gious sites in ve ry remote areas of the country.A
well-heeled traveller wishing to visit the Khumbu
or Mustang areas of Himalayan Nepal, for example,
can now charter a helicopter to do so, reducing his tra-

Such festiva l s , generally held on dates determ i n e d

1 People and tourism
Once a region that chiefly attracted inve t e r at e
t r e k k e rs and climbers , the Himalayas are now
d r awing an increasing number of visitors who
place a high premium on personal enrichment through
contact with other cultures,a trend that is not without
m i rr o ring Buddhism’s gr owing appeal in the we s t .
Such journeys might invo l ve visiting religious sites,
attending festivals or gaining a better unders t a n d i n g
of the workings of Himalayan communities.
To dat e , the impact of intern ational tourism on the
r e gion has chiefly focused on environmental issues,
such as deforestation and pollution, which tend to be
more outwardly visible than the effects on local socie-
ties and their cultures. But as tourism to the regi o n
continues to gr ow—it has doubled over the past ten
ye a rs to an annual two-and-a-half million visitors — t e n-
sions are beginning to emerge between the confli c t i n g
aims of intern ational visitors and host communities,
p a rticularly at the mainly Buddhist Himalayan monas-
t e ri e s , temples and festiva l s.
Once a major force in keeping isolated commu-
nities together, these festiva l s ,c h a r a c t e rized by spec-
tacular masked dances, h ave in many cases become
cultural products for sale to touri s t s. In recent ye a rs ,
their popularity has often resulted in modific ation of

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
coincide with the festiva l s.The easier the monastery
is to reach,the more visitors will come, which increases
the likelihood that their presence will alter the festiva l
in some way.Typical problems include inconsiderat e
p h o t o gr a p hy and local people being crowded out by
v i s i t o rs , although this is sometimes encouraged by
monastic authorities who exploit the chance to make
a little money. Selling tickets to tourists and ensuri n g
t h at they get pri o rity seating can generate much-
needed curr e n cy but also cause local resentment.
E ven the structure of the festivals can be altered as a
r e s u l t , sometimes by programme changes where
dances are shortened to accommodate we s t e rn e r ’s low
boredom thresholds. Another unwelcome by-pro-
duct has been the escalation of a black market in reli-
gious art work (particularly in small, p o rtable stat u e s
and t h a n k a s ( r e l i gious paintings on silk) and at least one
m o n a s t e ry on the tourist beat has had to use its tou-
rism revenues to install security screening.
A tourist-driven religious revival
It is not just the Buddhist festivals that at t r a c t
v i s i t o rs. In lowland areas of Nepal,Hindu festivals and
masked Hindu dances at Bhaktapur also draw touri s t s ,
most of whom will combine such a trip with visits to
the World Heritage sites of the Kathmandu va l l e y. I n
the we s t e rn Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh, m o s t
people are Mahayana Buddhists with beliefs consis-
ting of a mixture of Ta n t ric and animistic pre-Buddhist
Bon influ e n c e s.Their festivals take place in the bleak
winter months when villagers gather together. S t a l l s
and a market develop around the go m p a s ( f o rt r e s s
m o n a s t e ri e s ) , highlighting the festiva l ’s role in uniting
s c attered communities, and masked dances are also
p e r f o rm e d .While such events have been visited by we s-
t e rn e rs for many ye a rs , a more recent development is
the “ Fe s t i val of Ladakh”held during the first week of
August and organized by the tourist office rather than
monastic authori t i e s , purely to attract visitors.
In Bhutan the state religion is the Drukpa Kagyupa
school of  Ta n t ric Buddhism with around 5,000 monks
a c c o m m o d ated in fort r e s s - m o n a s t e ries call d zo n g s
t h at form the kingpin of all tourist itinerari e s.T h e i r
annual masked dance festivals (t s e c h u) are the only time
v i s i t o rs may enter many of the d zo n g s.A few ye a rs ago,
s e veral of the monasteries were placed off-limits after
complaints over abu s i ve photogr a p hy.The effect on the
Bhutanese tourism industry was so severe that most
h ave now re-opened.The dates and locations of fes-
t i vals are now available on the WWW and tours may
be booked via the intern e t .
While the incident points to a gr owing depen-
dence on tourist reve n u e , in some cases, i n c r e a s e d
p r o s p e rity as a result of tourism has led to no less than
a religious reviva l .Tengboche monastery in the Solu
area of the Sherpa country in Nepal is now a pri m e
t o u rist destinat i o n , housing an active community of
over 40 monks.Yet the monastery was almost desert e d
in the 1970s when the monks left to work in trekking
t o u ri s m , and destroyed by fire in 1988. M a s k e d
dances were only introduced here in 1942 but are
n ow seen annually by hundreds of touri s t s — m o r e
than 80 per cent of the audience may be foreign—pro-
ducing revenue to keep the monastery going and
expand its activities, which now include a solar-
h e ated lodge and helicopter landing pad. C h a r gi n g
v i s i t o rs for admission either to monasteries or to
masked dances may also generate funding for essen-
tial replacement and repairs to costumes and masks,
as well as for monastic education progr a m m e s.
But local complaints about the bad behaviour of
v i s i t o rs to sacred sites are increasingly common, and it
seems possible that a tolerance threshold has been
r e a c h e d . Some tour operat o rs have started to publish
booklets about festiva l s , d e s c ribing the rituals and
giving visitors tips on etiquette, such as where to stand,
and when and when not to take photos.As tourism to
the region increases—in areas not controlled by a
quota system,annual increases of 10 to 20 per cent can
be anticipat e d — v i s i t o rs must learn to better align their
e x p e c t ations and behaviour with those of local com-
m u n i t i e s. Not doing so can produce resentment—

drought that has afflicted their kingdom for the past four
ye a rs to the malign presence of foreign touri s t s. n

explain how to read totem pole carvings with their
b o g e y wo m e n , thunderbirds and other my t h o l o gi c a l
c h a r a c t e rs.
These scenes reflect the gr owing tourist demand
to discover and experience abori ginal cultures.At the
same time, they tell a story about control over the
gr owing abori ginal tourism niche market. F r o m
I q a l u i t , the capital of the new Canadian terri t o ry of
Nunavut, to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, native
e n t r e p r e n e u rs themselves are increasingly show i n g
off their cultures—and profiting from it.This stands
in contrast to many other parts of the world where
indigenous communities have little control or eve n
s ay in tourist inflows that are having sometimes
huge impacts on their cultures and societies.
“While we have played a role in the touri s m
i n d u s t ry for ye a rs , we were somewhat margi n a-
l i z e d ,” s ays Barry Pa r k e r , president of the Canadian
N ational A b o ri ginal To u rism A s s o c i ation (CNATA ) .
“ We were thought of in terms of p ow wow s or other
cultural celebrations, or as ‘wilderness guides’ for
hunting and fishing.”
N at i ve entrepreneurs no longer merely stage
a b b r e v i at e d ,s i m p l i fied dance shows for tour gr o u p s
which quickly move on to other ersatz attractions,
or souvenir shops selling mass-produced trinkets.
To d ay, indigenous populations are providing trans-
p o rt ation services and accommodations while ope-
ning galleries, restaurants, theatres and even their
own homes.
Not all abori ginal communities in Canada or
Australia welcome touri s m .H owe ve r ,m a ny see it as
an important source of income. C N ATA is “ b o t t o m
line ori e n t e d ,” s ays Pa r k e r.“Our business is job crea-
tion and revenue creat i o n .” P r o m o t e rs say touri s m
also allows abori ginals to teach others about their
t r a d i t i o n s , thus helping strengthen indigenous
c u l t u r e .
Aboriginal Business Canada,a federal govern-
ment agency, cites tourism development as one of
its top three priorities.There are now about 1,000
Canadian abori ginal tourism businesses (i.e., bu s i-
nesses that are at least 51 per cent owned or
controlled by nat i ve people) generating up to some
$200 million in revenue per year, according to the
federal gove rn m e n t ’s Department of Indian A f fa i rs.
These companies provide about 15,000 jobs sea-
sonally and 7,500 year round.
Indigenous tourism has become so economically
i m p o rtant to both countries that gove rnments and
aboriginal peoples have established official groups
to promote and control the industry. Besides the
C N ATA , these include A b o ri ginal To u rism A u s-
t r a l i a , the National A b o ri ginal and To rres Strait
Islander Tourism Industry Strategy (NATSITIS)
and A b o ri ginal To u rism British Columbia (AT B C ) .
E ven Nunav u t , the new terri t o ry in nort h e rn
Canada, has its own tourism body, promoting the
Eskimo (Inuit) culture.

Australia has about 200 abori gi n a l - o p e r at e d
t o u rism bu s i n e s s e s , according to Graeme Pri e s t l e y,
who manages the federal gove rn m e n t ’s section res-
ponsible for developing aboriginal tourism.These
businesses are generating almost $20 million in
revenue per year,with sales in indigenous arts and
crafts amounting to an estimated $130 million
a n n u a l l y, according to the Australian Office of
N ational To u ri s m . P riestley believes that indige-
nous tourism could be a much more signific a n t
business opportunity for aboriginal people.
The gr owing revenues going back to their com-
munities mark progress for those aborigines who
want to encourage touri s m . But by their standards,
more can be done.The Canadian Tourism Com-
mission estimates that if aboriginal peoples shared

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
l ation—four per cent of Canada’s total—abori gi n a l
t o u rism would bring in about $1 billion annually—
five times what it does today—and provide as many
as 40,000 jobs.
L i k e w i s e , despite progr e s s , A u s t r a l i a ’s abori-
gines still face several major obstacles to deve l o-
ping touri s m .To begin with, a b o ri ginal land claims
must be legally resolved.Without legal land titles,
a b o ri ginal people find it difficult to secure bank
loans to start up their bu s i n e s s e s.Also in short sup-
ply are the business skills needed to successfully
run a company.To try to fill these gaps, the gove rn-
ment has worked with aboriginal authorities to set
up a range of support i ve measures—from indivi-
dual grants to training programmes.
Hazel Douglas, a member of the Guguyalanji
tribe in the far north of Australia’s Queensland,is
fully aware of the difficulties of breaking into the
tourism trade. “When I started my business [five
ye a rs ago], people said,‘ O h ,s h e ’s just an abori gi n a l
l a d y, she’ll only last a couple of day s ,’ ” D o u g l a s
told The Australian newspaper. Today, her award-
winning bu s i n e s s ,N at i ve Guide Safa ri To u rs ,l e a d s
groups across the rugged terrain of the Daintree
rainforest, aWorld Heritage site, and Cape Tribu-
l ation National Pa r k .While recounting legends and
explaining traditional culture, she takes her gr o u p s
into the bush to show them how to eat the thirst-
quenching abdomens of live green ants—high in
vitamin C. She also teaches them how to fix snake-
bite with seaweed and how to listen to the bird calls
near the river to know whether a crocodile lies in
wa i t . For Douglas, the tour is more than just a bu s i-
n e s s. “The most important thing is to educat e
people about abori ginal culture and to preserve it,”
she says.
Pa rt of this educational task lies in dealing with
the stereotypes tourists expect to see during their
visits. “People still have the impression that we are
living in the past,” says Jeff Watts,a member of the
Tseshaht tribe in Canada who started his native
culture tour in Va n c o u ver last ye a r.When tourists ask
Watts to take them to a native Indian village, he
teases them by suggesting they hail down the next
covered wagon.
The abori ginal tourism offering is considerable.
In Canada, the possibilities include digging into
traditional indigenous fare at a Haida longhouse res-
taurant serving the likes of toasted seaweed, wild
Pacific sea asparagus, goat ribs and caribou; living
with Inuit families at an igloo camp or spending a
week on an Indian reserve sleeping in a longhouse
or tepee; searching for shaggy musk-ox ; or perhaps
learning drum dances and native games. In Aus-
tralia, one can take tours to aboriginal homelands
to learn how to use a boomerang, listen to native
dreamtime legends, visit an abori ginal emu fa rm or
take a day trip in the scrubs to look for spiny ant
eaters and kangaroo.
Spirituality is
not for sale
In many cases visitors to aboriginal lands have
to learn to live like locals, far away from modern
c o nve n i e n c e s. For example, in Canada, t o u ri s t s
may have to accept caribou hairs on their bannock
bread, while in remote parts of Australia, accom-
modation is in cement floor huts with only basic
washing facilities.
There is often a clash between expectations and
reality, with the result that sometimes tourists are
disappointed while their hosts are astounded by
o u t s i d e rs ’p e r c e p t i o n s. For example, one tour com-
p a ny reportedly received a complaint from a South
Australian tourist that the abori gines in the
M a nyalluk community wore T- s h i rts and short s
instead of loincloths.
Many aboriginal people are aware of possible
n e g at i ve effects of touri s m . In some instances entire
communities are off limits. In other cases, native
communities are controlling deve l o p m e n t ,p u t t i n g
sacred sites off limits and preventing public access
to some ceremonies.
“ E l d e rs generally welcome the opportunity to
share aspects of their cultures with others , but are ada-
mant that their spirituality is not for sale,” s ays CNA-
TA ’s Pa r k e r.“There are things that are not for others
to see or share.Mainstream tourism needs to know this
to ensure appropri at e , authentic products are deve-
loped and marketed with cultural sensitivity.”
E ven more important than the impact of touri s m
on the land is its effect on the people.Says Parker:
“No one wants to feel like they are fish in a fish bow l
or have people invade their space.” n
In Kaan,an Amerindian village in British Columbia (Canada), visitors can learn about the
significance of totems from local guides.
‘ T h e re are things 
that are not for others 
to see or share.
M a i n s t ream tourism needs
to know this to ensure
a p p ro p r i a t e, authentic pro d u c t s
a re developed and marke t e d
with cultural sensitivity.’

mind: one leaves
behind the prejudices
of one’s own country,
and one is hardly
qualified to take on
those of foreigners.

In the heart of Ecuador’s rain forest, f o rt y - five
minutes by foot away from their own village, a
small group of Huaorani, an Amazon indigenous
p e o p l e , built a palm-thatched roof cabin for eight.
Fe a ring that too much tourism could disrupt their tra-
ditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle and bring in unwe l-
come consumer habits, the Huaorani only accept one
group of visitors per month, for two to six day s.
But during this time, they are gi ven full at t e n t i o n .
Community representat i ves greet visitors upon their
a rri val and discuss some of their people’s social and
e nvironmental concern s. D u ring this first meeting,
a per-night fee is paid to the head of the community
for each visitor and the money is distri buted eve n l y
among all the fa m i l i e s. S a l a ries for the va rious jobs
( g u i d e s , m a i n t e n a n c e , canoe paddlers etc) are cal-
c u l ated by doubling what a person would earn as a
labourer for an oil company, the main altern at i ve
source of income.Huaorani guides accompany visi-
t o rs on hikes and teach them about medicinal plants,
the rainforest’s ecology, their spiritual relationship with
the env i r o n m e n t , and local handicrafts.At the end of
their tri p,v i s i t o rs are invited to raise awareness in their
own countries about the Huaorani’s efforts to defend
their land and culture.This initiat i ve has led to dona-
tions that have financed training wo r k s h o p s , h i g h

F rom Ecuador to Namibia, indigenous communities are striking up innovative partners h i p s
with tour opera t o rs to promote ecotourism on their own terms—a strategy to bring in
revenue and protect their culture and enviro n m e n t
in a region prone to outside encroachment—from
unscrupulous jungle tour operators to petroleum
companies—managed to set up a project that won
a prize for the best ecotourism programme at the
1998 Berlin To u rism Expo is not a product of
c h a n c e . It took nine months of planning and ori e n-
t ation meetings for the Huaorani to finetune a tou-
rism strategy, a task carried out hand in hand with
TROPIC Ecological Adventures, a tour operator
with a long experience in working with indigenous
communities, notably on bringing the Huaorani’s
problems with the oil industry to intern at i o n a l
at t e n t i o n . Not only has this community defined its
own rules for tourism, but it has gained indispen-
sable exposure on the international travel market
through a fruitful business partnership.
A strong 
conservationist slant
Just as import a n t l y, the Huaorani have opted for
a self-managed community-based activity that repre-
sents a potential economic altern at i ve to oil and log-
gi n g .M a ny indigenous communities see ecotouri s m
as the most rational way of protecting the rainforest,
c r e ating jobs for the young and generating reve n u e
for educat i o n , community health and transport at i o n .
They also see it as a way of maintaining their cultural
i n t e gri t y. Ecuador is a ve ritable laborat o ry for com-
munity-based ecotouri s m , with some env i r o n m e n-
talists contending that revenues earned from touri s m
in the Amazon rainforest could eventually outstri p
oil earnings.
The Cofan indigenous people have developed a
fairly sophisticated management system in Zabalo,
under the guidance of Randy Borm a n , the son of an
A m e rican missionary who grew up with the Cofa n
and has played a leading role in resisting the effort s
of oil companies to prospect on their terri t o ry. I n
1 9 9 2 , B o rman established a community-run com-
p a ny in Zabalo with ten Cofan associates who
i nvested their labour in building guest cabins. O t h e r
community members are paid for doing va rious jobs
while a small co-operat i ve craft store also brings in
i n c o m e .These va rious initiat i ves provide the Cofa n
of Zabalo with an estimated $500 annually per
p e rs o n .The project also has a strong conservat i o n i s t
s l a n t : the community has defined separate zones for
hunting and ecotouri s m , with fines levied on

m e m b e rs for taking certain species such as toucans
and parrots (particularly coveted by touri s t s ) , or for
exceeding quotas in the hunting zones.
Besides the need for a close relationship with a
p a rtner who has a sound knowledge of the trave l
market and a sensitivity toward indigenous com-
m u n i t i e s , such projects need at least five ye a rs before
they can become commercially viable.Training is the
backbone of any succcessful enterp ri s e .E ven though
these trips are no-frills experi e n c e s , some basic
notions such as punctuality and hy giene in food pre-
p a r ation have to be understood by the community.
Just as import a n t , if a real exchange is to happen
d u ring the tri p, guides have to know how to speak to
v i s i t o rs about their lifestyle and natural surr o u n-
d i n g s , and realize that they may have to slow dow n
their pace when leading hikes along rainforest trails.
All this requires dialogue and a community that is
united around a respected leader. Although NGOs
h ave also assisted communities in developing touri s m
p r o j e c t s , e x p e rience shows that they often lack
contacts on the travel market to make these initiat i ve s
v i a b l e .
‘Unlike oil,
tourism is sustainable’
Other countries and continents are also boosting
their presence on this niche market which is at t r a c-
ting more and more North A m e rican and European
t r ave l l e rs. Take the case of Ve n e z u e l a . H e r e , o n e
indigenous group, the Pemons, does not flinch at
accepting 100 tourists a day who fly in from a beach
resort on Margarita Island to visit Salto Angel,the
wo r l d ’s highest wat e r fa l l , in the southeast of the
c o u n t ry. Besides accompanying visitors to the fa l l s
and serving them a meal, the Pemons have also
built a village (an hour by road away from their ow n )
of ten traditional cabins for ove rnight gr o u p s.To u-
rism revenue (the Pemons receive about $25 per day
per visitor, the total package costing $70) has serve d
to set up a school and a health dispensary and
make up for declining state subsidies. A n o t h e r
gr o u p, the Ye ’ Ku a n a s , won rights from the gove rn-
ment to manage land-use of a forest reserve . Pa rt of
it, beyond a natural barrier formed by a waterfall
over the Caura ri ve r , is off limits to visitors , while in
a n o t h e r , they have built guest cabins and deve-
loped itineraries for tourists in part n e rship with
Natura Raid,an operator based in Caracas.
As awareness of environmental issues has spread
over the past decade,a growing number of travel-
lers are looking into how the adventure/discovery-
style trips they choose benefit communities. In res-
ponse, the latter are joining forces in an effort to
better promote their projects and design common
s t a n d a r d s. In Ecuador, the CONFENIAE, a confe-
deration of indigenous groups from the Amazon
basin, has published guidelines for managing eco-
tourism.The Ecuadorian Ecotourism Association
has designed tools for eva l u ating the env i r o n m e n t a l
policies of tour operators, which are now used in
other Latin A m e rican countri e s. In A f ri c a ,N a m i b i a
f o rmed a national association for community-based
t o u rism (NAC O B TA) in 1995 which groups 41
communities from a range of ethnic gr o u p s. It pro-
vides advice and training to communities seeking to
start up projects, but also keeps a high profile in
i n t e rn ational travel fa i rs. M a ny experts see
N AC O B TA as one of the most rational ways for pro-
moting and defending this touri s m , which by nat u r e ,
is small in scale and highly personalized.
The challenge today lies in designing national
s t r at e gies that put the accent on training, access to
markets and capital, and safety norms—issues that
will be on the agenda of the Ecotourism Society’s
general assembly, to be held in December 1999 in
Q u i t o, upon the inv i t ation of the Ecuadorian gove rn-
m e n t .C l e a r l y, this gesture is another sign that indi-
genous groups have gained a voice at national leve l ,
and tourism is just one way in which they are being
h e a r d . As one Ecuadorian ecotourism operator put
it,“Unlike oil,tourism is sustainable.” n
In good hands: indigenous guides in Venezuela accompany visitors along the Caura river, a tributary of the Orinoco.

the 20th century who

his prejudices.

34 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 1999
w Peruvian archaeologist
Pe r u ’s ‘meet the people’ tours
The European Union and the Peruvian government are setting up a scheme for alternative 
tourism that benefits host communities
Pe ru , the cradle of ancient civilizations and the
home of active indigenous communities, i s
attracting more and more tourists who want to
get away from the old “See a country in seven day s
and nights” package and is putting more and more
emphasis on its cultural and archaeological assets.
Until recently, however, key elements like contact
with local people have been neglected.
To put things right, the European Union and
the Committee to Promote Peru (PromoPerú)
launched a jointly funded 1m-euro programme in
1996 to develop the country’s tangible and intan-
gible cultural attractions “from within”.
The scheme, whose joint director is a Belgian
tourism consultant, Lieve Coppin, is known as
the “ I n t e gr ated Support Programme for the
Development of Tourism in Peru”. It grew out of
a series of seminars involving public and private
bodies, local associations and rural communities.
The job that had to be done was no sinecure.
Factors such as terrorism and a cholera epidemic
which broke out in 1990 and ravaged the country
between 1991 and 1993 had reduced Peru’s
attractiveness as a tourist destination. Many ser-
vice companies went bankrupt and the tourist
industry suffered.
After nearly two years of fieldwork which took
Coppin all over the country, six “ d e ve l o p m e n t
z o n e s ” were chosen—three in the south (Barrio de
San Blas, U rubamba and Ollantaytambo) and three
in the north (Olleros-Chavín,Túcume and Caja-
m a r c a ) . A hundred or so proposals were consi-
dered from these areas, of which 31 were accepted.
W riting guidebooks, designing posters and lea-
fle t s , making maps of the sites and creating Intern e t
websites for communities where sometimes little
Spanish was spoken were some of the most urgent
tasks done by the scheme, which allotted betwe e n
$20,000 and $40,000 to each project.
The result is tourist packages that strengthen
cultural identity, respect the environment, active-
ly involve local communities and make a profit.
Among the tours on offer are “Posada Amazonas”
(“Explore the Tambopata jungle with the Ese’eja
people,” as the brochure says), “Willoc, Living
Inca Art and Culture” (“Learn with an Indian
family about the art of weaving modern tapestry
with ancient ya rn”) and “ Pe ru Llama Tr e k ”
(“Villagers and their llamas will take you to the
sources of Andean culture”).
Tourism with 
cultural identity
E l s e w h e r e , the attraction of prestigi o u s
archaeological sites like Machu Picchu has been
used to develop tourism in nearby communities.
For example, the salt pans at Maras
(“Participatory Tourism in Urubamba”), draw
very few of the many tourists who every day visit
the spectacular ancient Inca city just over an hour
away.The project aims to extend Machu Picchu’s
sphere of influence to Maras, where visitors can
take part in activities like extracting the salt using
methods handed down over the generations and
will be guided around by the villagers themselves.
However, in trying to market these tours, the
organizers have encountered a certain lack of
enthusiasm on the part of tour operators who
regard the projects as competition, albeit on a
small scale.Another problem is lack of inspection
of arrangements that might clash with internatio-
nal consumer protection laws. To overcome these
obstacles, the flow of information must be impro-
ved between local tour operators, foreign travel
agents and customers.
The next step is to get the authorities to treat
tourism as a major economic activity. Only then
will such projects become part of a medium and
long-term plan through which Peru will be able to
fulfil the main goal of the programme, to offer
“tourism with cultural identity”. n

July/August 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 35
Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
Visiting archaeological sites, monuments and
museums is often an ambivalent kind of tou-
rism.On the one hand,it is seen as having an
i m p o rtant educational and social function,h e l p i n g
tourists to find out more about the culture of the
communities they visit. On the other, it is regarded
as a major ri s k , especially for physically fragile sites
(containing cave paintings, for example) which
attract flocks of touri s t s , and sites where touri s t
facilities are few or inadequate.
So excessive exploitation of sites by tourism has
been criticized on the grounds that it may rob host
communities of their traditional cultural landmarks
and destroy the authenticity and significance of
their heri t a g e . This happens when attempts are
m a d e , through superficial presentations or video
games,to cater for visitors who want to be given a
quick general picture of the site.
This conflict cannot be solved by cultural mea-
sures alone.The growing economic importance of
a r c h a e o l o gical sites, monuments and museums
over the past 15 years as a result of tourist demand
must be taken into account as well.
To cope with the pressure, m a ny countries have
made big efforts to improve and diversify the pre-
sentation of their cultural heritage.Museums have
been refurbished. More than $1.1 billion was spent
on doing up the Louvre in Pa ri s. New sites have
sprung up, including modern art museums in San
F r a n c i s c o, B a r c e l o n a , R o m e , To k yo, Hong Kong
and Bilbao.
Historic city centres have been renovated, and
famous monuments such as the Grassi Palace and
the Ca Rezzonico in Venice have been restored.
There has been a sharp rise in the number of big
exhibitions. More than half a million visitors rou-
tinely visit blockbuster shows (e.g.Vermeer atThe
Hague, Monet in Chicago, and Cézanne and
Georges de la Tour in Paris). The 1999 Monet
exhibition in London broke the record for a tem-
porary exhibition, clocking up more than 8,500
visitors a day.
These efforts to popularize culture have been
widely supported by the media. For most visitors,
h e ritage has become a fa m i l i a r , easily accessible
commodity providing surp ri s e s , r e l a x ation and
e n j oy m e n t . The substantial gr owth in short - s t ay
cultural tourism reflects this. Such packages typically
include a reserved ticket for one or more cultural
e ve n t s , such as an exhibition or an opera, train or air
fare, and board—preferably in a charming hotel.
So tourism has been a driving force over the
past 15 ye a rs in taking cultural heritage into the
economic mainstream. This has brought changes
in the way heritage is preserved and deve l o p e d ,
including the role played by institutions and
i nve s t m e n t .
Pressures to create 
jobs and income
In most countries with big tourist industri e s ,
apart from the United States and Britain, cultural
sites have long been run by public institutions, a n d
the money earned from visitors is largely ploughed
back into the sites.This funding is sometimes top-
ped up by other private and public investment.
In some cases however, the income from these
sites is used for other purposes than their preser-
vation and development, as may be justified by
the economic plight of some of the host countries.
This means there is an incentive to over-exploit
the cultural heritage while cutting back on the
investment needed to preserve and present it pro-
perly.Worse, it can lead to the building of tourist

facilities, especially hotels, whose poor location
and mediocre design seriously harm the quality
and authenticity of cultural landscapes.
Planned management of sites can usually
avoid such mistakes, though sometimes pressure
from economic interests means the plans are not
carried out.This has happened with efforts to res-
tore and preserve the sites at Angkor Wat, in
Cambodia, and Petra, in Jordan (see article page
40).
The growth of tourism, especially the income
it provides, has sometimes induced cultural insti-
tutions to develop and redirect some of their acti-
vities. In France, the National Museums service
(RMN), which runs all state museums, was given
commercial status in 1990, enabling it to collect
entrance fees, publish art books and sell associa-
ted items.The RMN now has an annual turnover
of $125 million and employs about 1,000 people.
In Britain, spinoff income (from heritage-rela-
ted items, mail-order and restaurants) earned by
the National Trust, a private body which manages
more than 500 historic buildings and natural
sites, tops $75 million. New York’s Metropolitan
Museum of Art earns close to $110 million. In
many countries, governments encourage the pri-
vate sector to provide funds to support cultural
heritage or to set up foundations.
Most of the time, cultural institutions and
tourist operators co-operate, via agreements to
share staff training facilities and other forms of
partnership. But clashes occur too. The Tunisian
national tourist office recently claimed the right
to administer directly all the country’s monu-
ments, museums and cultural sites, since most of
the income from admission charges and the sale
of associated items comes from tourists.The mat-
ter was only settled when the president of the
republic stepped in and ruled that this was a job
for the country’s cultural institutions.
Private and public investment to protect cul-
tural heritage (preservation and restoration) is
generally declining while funds to enhance it are
increasing.1 Cultural sites are coming under gro-
wing economic pressure to generate jobs and
income.These days,an economic feasibility study
is often commissioned to back up proposals to
fund the development of a site, monument or
museum.
Furthermore, public funding for preservation
and development now needs simply to be justified
by the presence of a clear “economic”goal, most-
ly based on tourism-related arguments, as in the
case of the European Union’s Leader II, Interreg
and Phare programmes, which received some
$1.9 billion between 1994 and 1999. By compa-
rison, over the same period, the Raphael pro-
gramme—the European Union’s only project
specifically designed to safeguard and preserve
cultural property—drew a mere $38 million.
Heritage supermarkets
Tourism can benefit cultural heritage as long
as there is a cultural rationale independent of eco-
nomic interests, even if it is to some extent adap-
ted to these interests.This means having laws and
r e g u l ations and guaranteed public funding.
Cultural officials must also have a more realistic
view of the obligations and benefits of the econo-
mics of tourism. This implies greater respect for
the private sector’s management skills, insofar as
the private sector can adapt to the specific task of
running monuments, sites and museums which
have become “consumer goods”.
If the law of the market is applied indiscrimi-
nately, it may lead to jazzed-up heritage super-
markets which have been standardized and adap-
ted to meet consumer demand. And where the
authentic heritage would be ill-adapted to this
kind of presentation, there is nothing to rule out
making a copy of it, not to protect the original (as
in the case of prehistoric cave painting sites), but
to increase profits.
This is the idea behind the new seaside resort
at Yasmin Hammamet, in Tu n i s i a , where a
55,000-square-metre artificial medina is being
built. In it, there will be none of the access,traffic
or management problems that exist these days in
real-life medinas. n
A casino-hotel in Las Vegas (United States) recreates an Egyptian setting.
1.This trend is difficult to quantify because financial data
do not make it possible to clearly separate funding
earmarked for preservation from funding for development.
Private and public investment 
to protect cultural heritage
( p reservation and re s t o ration) 
is generally declining 
while funds to enhance it 
a re incre a s i n g
Pompeii is a most
surprising sight: this
sudden leap across 19
centuries astonishes
even the most prosaic

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
The Roman city of Po m p e i i , a stone’s throw
from Naples, was bu ried beneath volcanic ash
when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD. It was res-
tored pretty much intact as a result of systematic
e x c avations which began in 1748, but in recent
ye a rs it has been facing a second, s l ower death at the
hands of a host of largely unwitting culprits. The
ruins attract a flood of visitors , whose numbers
rose from 863,000 in 1981 to nearly two million in
1 9 9 8 .There are not enough attendants patrolling the
site to prevent the murals,frescos, mosaics,sculp-
tures and other fragile remains from being damaged
(or even stolen).The site has been poorly adminis-
t e r e d , to put it mildly. The official previously in
charge is currently under inve s t i g ation for
embezzlement.
On top of this, the ravages of time and the
weather have been aggravated by the fact that the
authorities have often opted to continue excava-
ting instead of making sure that buildings already
unearthed were properly preserved. Forty-nine of
the site’s 64 hectares have now been excavated,
but whereas in 1956 visitors could see 64 houses
or buildings in the ancient city, for the past few
years they only been able to see 16 because the
others have been cordoned off for protection.
Concern about the situation is widespread.
“At this rate, in 10 years’ time there won’t be
much to see at Pompeii,” said Andrea Carandini,
one of Italy’s most eminent archaeologists, in
1 9 9 5 . A year lat e r , the U.S.-based Wo r l d
Monuments Fund (WMF) classified Pompeii as
one of the world’s most endangered sites. In
1998, the city was put on UNESCO’s World
Heritage List.
Three years ago, a page was turned when a
respected expert, Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, was
appointed superintendent of Pompeii.The follo-
wing year, the Italian parliament gave the site
a d m i n i s t r ation broad financial independence.
Until then, visitors’ entry fees went directly to the
government, which allotted varying amounts of
money to the country’s archaeological and histo-
ric sites.
“Since my appointment, I’ve concentrated on
setting up an independent administration and
above all on trying to prevent damage to the
archaeological monuments,” says Guzzo, who has
introduced a “theme walk” with arrows to direct
visitors around the huge site. He has a budget of
$11 million, three-quarters of which comes from
the sale of tickets and items associated with the
site. However, studies have shown that “saving”
Pompeii will cost about $310 million.
Help has been promised or is under way from
museums and universities in Italy and abroad, as
well as the WMF, which decided last year to pro-
vide $600,000 over three years, mainly to fund a
general assessment of the state of the site and the
drafting of detailed criteria for restoration work.
To further boost Pompeii’s resources, a law
passed by the Italian parliament in 1997 said
“private firms who want to take part in the resto-
ration can obtain tax breaks under certain cir-
cumstances.” Wild rumours have spread recently
about the supposedly “imminent” conversion of
the site into a “theme park” with guides dressed
in Roman togas, but Guzzo has categorically
denied there are any such plans. nw UNESCO Courier journalist

Engulfed in volcanic ash 2,000 years ago, the ancient Roman city was slowly dying

Limiting the number of visitors entering a house at a given time (above, the villa of the
Vettii) is one proposal currently being studied in Pompeii.

40 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 1999
“Petra has changed more in the last 15 ye a rs
than it did in the previous 14 centuries,”
s ays Ahmed Salamin, who knows what
he is talking about. He was born in Wadi Moussa,
the nearest town to the outstanding Jordanian site,
and served as its mayor before becoming assistant
director-general of the Petra Regional Planning
Council (PRPC). Fourteen centuries ago, he says,
a series of earthquakes seriously damaged the
ancient city, once the capital of the kingdom of the
N a b at a e a n s , an Arab people who controled the
c a r avan trade routes between Arabia and the Medi-
terranean before they were conquered by Rome in
106 A.D.
To d ay, Petra and those who seek to preserve the
site have nothing to fear from the forces of nature
or the Roman Empire.The present danger comes
from the legions of tourists overrunning the site,
whose 800 monuments carved into pink stone we r e
included on UN E S C O’s World Heritage List in 1985.
The number of visitors rose from 100,000 in the lat e
1980s to 400,000 six ye a rs lat e r , then declined
s l i g h t l y. Recent regional tensions stemming from the
crisis with Iraq and the deadlock in the peace pro-
cess have deterred visitors, especially Israelis and
A m e ri c a n s , from visiting some Middle Eastern
countries.
A comprehensive plan
Concerned about the influx of tourists and the
chaotic growth of Wadi Moussa, Queen Noor of
Jordan sounded the alarm in the early 1990s. She
appealed to UN E S C O,which sent a mission of expert s
to Petra in 1992.The outcome was the Management
Plan for the Petra National Pa r k , which includes an
a rr ay of measures cove ring the conservation and res-
t o r ation of monuments, site deve l o p m e n t , t h e
i m p r ovement of infrastru c t u r e s ,c h a rting a future for
the area’s 25,000 inhabitants, and protection of
the environment.
In accordance with the plan’s recommenda-
t i o n s , the Jordanian authorities set up the PRPC in
1995 to bring together all the official bodies
c o n c e rn e d . Chaired by the minister of touri s m ,t h e
council includes representat i ves of the depart m e n t
of antiquities, the ministries of planning, finance,
l a b o u r , h e a l t h , local gove rn m e n t , and irri g at i o n ,

communities. Financed by a 25 per cent cut of the

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
site’s receipts,the council is empowered to review
and approve all decisions concerning Pe t r a . B u t
s e veral questions remain unanswe r e d . Does it have
enough political clout to control all the changes in
its 900-square-kilometre area of competence? How
can conser vation needs and tourism interests be
balanced in a country where tourism accounts for
earnings of nearly one billion dollars a year and
17,500 jobs?
So far,tourism does not seem to have inflicted
irreparable damage on Petra, and the prospect of
increased revenues has led to some indispensable
i m p r ove m e n t s. Under a $27-million pri o rity action
plan set up with the help of the World Bank in
1996, construction work has begun on a drainage
s y s t e m .P r e v i o u s l y, u n t r e ated waste and waste wat e r
were often discharged into the env i r o n m e n t . I n
a d d i t i o n , t e rraces dating back to the Nabat a e a n
p e riod have been gradually restored and wadi beds
c l e a n e d . Once the hydraulic work is completed,
the authorities will renovate the road netwo r k ,e s p e-
cially in the centre of Wadi Moussa, which is
congested with buses and taxis. O l i ve and pine
trees are being planted to stop desert i fic at i o n .R e f o-
r e s t ation “will help absorb water in the event of
t o rrential rainfall and beautify the site,” s ays Zeidoun
al-Muheisen, director-general of the PRPC.“And
i t ’s the best way to prevent unauthorized bu i l d i n g .”
T h at threat , among others , is associated with the
activities of the Bduls, Bedouin who lived in the
ruins of Petra until 1985.They farmed in the area
and had their goats graze there before being expelled
and rehoused in the village of Oum Seyhoun on the
edge of the archaeological park. N ow most of them
make a living from touri s m , renting horses or selling
t ri n k e t s. But the tri b e ’s population has continued to
gr ow and the Bduls, who believe they have been mis-
treated, are cramped in their new village. “There
were 40 Bdul families in 1985. To d ay there are
350,” says Salamin.“The tourist boom has drawn
newcomers from the Aqaba region.If they want to
move here all they have to do is buy land.”
If they can afford it. Land prices have skyroc-
k e t e d .T h at is why, s ay the Bduls, they are forced to
add storeys to their houses, which are now visible
from the site, where their flocks still gr a z e .They can
also expand Oum Seyhoun, but only on its nort h e rn
s i d e .The east is set aside for reforestat i o n , the south
is occupied by the archaeological site and the west
is part of the natural park that is currently being
created.This strictly regulated area will probably
c over 264 square kilometres, f o rming a huge bu f f e r
zone around Pe t r a .The U. S .N ational Parks Serv i c e
will train a team to manage the area. But the pro-
ject is still on the drawing board.
The hotels that have sprung up like mushrooms
in Wadi Moussa have also caused degr a d ation to the
s i t e .Ten ye a rs ago there were fewer than five ;t o d ay
there are around sixty. “The PRPC did not exist
when most of the building permits were issued,” s ay s
Salamin. “From now on we are making sure that
nothing which can have a negat i ve impact on Pe t r a
will be bu i l t .” He is probably thinking of the
unsightly Mövenpick restaurant, l o c ated a few
metres from the entrance to the archaeologi c a l
p a r k , and the six hotels overlooking the site from the
village of Taybé.The private sector is not the only
culprit.Two large public buildings stand at the left
of the entrance to Petra. One is the Wadi Moussa
sports hall.The other is the future headquarters of
the PRPC.
The admission fee at Petra is 20 dinars ($30), a n
exorbitant price that does not seem justified and
makes the Nabataean city one of the world’s most
e x p e n s i ve sites. Of cours e , some difficulties are
hard to avoid: to reach the heart of Petra, visitors
must take the Siq, a narr ow, 800-metre-long gorge
c a rved into the rock that leads to the impressive A l
K h a z n a h , a monument with a columned fa ç a d e
cut into the solid rock. Congestion seems inevi-
t a b l e .To limit it, h o rses are not allowed through the
gorge unless they are drawing carriages.
Other improvements have made life easier for
v i s i t o rs. Toilets have been bu i l t , the site is kept
meticulously clean, and souvenir ve n d o rs have been
grouped together and will eventually be move d
outside the park. On the other hand, the tourist
information centre is too small and is used almost
e x c l u s i vely to display the handicrafts made by local
women under the aegis of the Noor al-Hussein
Foundation.Signposting is minimal:there are few
maps and no explanations.
Under pressure from tourism and in the
absence of a local tradition of site restorat i o n ,
c o n s e rvation may be the most pressing issue. I n
Bdul, bedouins who once lived in Petra,now await tourists at the entrance to the site.
‘ F rom now on we are making 
s u re that nothing 
which can have a negative 
impact on Pe t ra 
will be built’
When one travels, one
accepts everything,
one leaves indignation
at home. One looks,
listens and becomes
enthusiastic about the
most appalling things
just because they are
new. Good travellers
are inhuman.

Ve n i c e: coping with 
c u l t u re vultures 
w Antonio Paolo Russo
Inundated with visitors,Venice is now trying to scare some of them off.
But there are better ways of rescuing the city from tourism
Beauty bears its bu r d e n s , and in tourism no
place illustrates this more clearly than Ve n i c e .
So popular a destination has it become that
t o u rism has created a crisis of economic, s o c i a l ,
demographic, but perhaps above all, cultural pro-
portions. However,it need not be so.
For ye a rs now,Venice has in many ways failed to
l i ve up to its romantic image. The centre is so
c r owded one can hardly move , shops offer low qua-
lity at high prices,and street vendors add an extra
decimal place to the price for a Korean tourist sear-
ching for a made-in-Korea carnival mask.
Things are not much better for the local
p o p u l at i o n .As services from schools to hospitals are
forced out of the city to make way for more cost-effi-
cient operations like fast food restaurants and sou-
venir shops,Venice is less and less able to hold on
to its citizens.The city’s population has now sunk to
about 68,000,only slightly more than a third of what
it was in 1951.This is understandable when one
c o n s i d e rs the disadvantages of living in Ve n i c e .R e s-
taurant meals are very expensive.The purchase of
a necessity like spectacles can invo l ve an hour’s
journey to neighbouring towns. If one happens to
c r ave French cheese, the excursion could stretch to
two hours.
1993 the German intern ational co-operat i o n
a g e n cy, the GTZ, launched an ambitious pro-
gramme in co-operation with Jo r d a n ’s depart m e n t
of antiquities. The first on-site training centre is
scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.A f t e r
years of work,the centre developed a natural mor-
tar which is particularly suitable for the stone at
Pe t r a . This discove ry seems especially import a n t
since the cement and reinforced concrete used in
earlier restoration work have caused damage to the
Khaznah and other monuments.These “modern”
m at e rials trap water in the monumental stonewo r k ,
which is gradually eaten away from within and
cracks in some places.
R e s t o r ation is a long job, but tour operat o rs are
in a hurry and the scales are tipping in their favo u r.
C o n s e rvationists are having trouble making their
voices heard.The department of antiquities report s
to the ministry of tourism, which does not like to
see scaffolding up for a long time. In an effort to
stop water seepage into some of the monuments,
the authorities have applied sprays that prevent the
stone from breathing and may cause the same pro-
blems as cement.
Controversial 
initiatives
That’s not all, say archaeologists,who are par-
ticularly critical of the activities of the Petra
National Trust,a private foundation whose mem-
bers are prominent figures who want to contribu-
te to the enhancement of Jordan’s foremost cul-
tural treasure. Chaired by Prince Raad ben Zeid,
a cousin of the late King Hussein, the Trust has
commissioned a Swiss company to build a series
of dams in the small valleys that give on to the
Siq. The purpose is to avoid a recurrence of the
tragedy that occurred in 1963, when 21 French
tourists drowned as a result of flash floods. The
$1.5-million project, which is financed by the
Swiss government, damages the site’s integrity,
say archaeologists, who would like to restore the
Nabataean hydraulic system. Experts are also
upset about the way the same company excavated
the ancient pavement “with a bulldozer and
without archaeological supervision.”To cap it all,
the Swiss firm coated the Siq’s unpaved surfaces
with a white, powdery substance that has spread
to the walls of the gorge, masking the rock’s
magnificent colours.
“We’re not here just to restore four monu-
ments, carry out a high-profile operation and
leave,” says Helge Fischer, head of the GTZ pro-
ject.“Our objective is to set up a Jordanian struc-
ture capable of looking after the restoration of
monuments.” This body, the Conservation and
Restoration Centre in Petra (CARCIP), will be
independent of the department of antiquities and
staffed by highly-qualified professionals. So far,
GTZ has spent $3.5 million on equipment and
training six specialized workers, two architects
and two stone-cutters. In the long term, the team
should comprise ten or more people. But CAR-
CIP has not yet got off the ground. n

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
Venice is thus a ve ry good case of unsustainable
t o u ri s m . W h at ’s under threat in Ve n i c e , which 250
years ago was one of the most powerful and most
p o p u l ated cities in Europe, is culture in the broadest
s e n s e .Ye s , the issue is heritage preservat i o n . But in
a d d i t i o n , both citizens and visitors presumably
want the city to remain a living entity, and not be
transformed into an empty stage,where the sterile
r e p r e s e n t ation of an act of consumption—tou-
rism—is performed
One approach is to scare off some of the tou-
ri s t s , n a m e l y, the day - t ri p p e rs who, n u m b e ri n g
some seven million per ye a r , pass a few hours in
the city, contribute to congestion at the main tou-
rist at t r a c t i o n s , add to transport at i o n , s a n i t at i o n
and other problems and spend only a minimal
amount of money in the city. To this end, Ve n i c e
recently hired Oliviero Toscani, the photographer
behind Italian clothes-maker Benetton’s contro-
ve rsial adve rt i s e m e n t s , to produce a negat i ve publi-
city campaign feat u ring images of garbage and dead
pigeons.
Smart cards to attract 
high spenders
H o p e f u l l y, by reducing the number of day - t ri p-
pers, the city will not only cut down on associated
costs, but also hold greater  allure for tourists pre-
pared to stay a few days—and thus put real money
into the local economy. H owe ve r , r ather than
shooing tourists away, a more durable solution is to
i m p r ove the supply side of the tourism industry
equation by creating a cultural tourism system.
This approach is based on the recognition that
Ve n i c e ’s cultural offering is so vast that it can sat i s f y
the demands of a public with quite different
p r e f e r e n c e s. H owe ve r , gr e ater efforts need to be
made to publicize this offering. Perhaps the most
expedient method is to set up an inform ation tech-
nology infrastructure allowing visitors to access
details about city sites as well as eve n t s , and to
make advance bookings.
This strategy could include the issuance of a
m u l t i - s e rvice “ Venice Card” o f f e ring tourists oppor-
tunities not available to those who do not book: f o r
example, the right to jump queues; discounts on
museum entry and transport fares, at restaurants
and in shops; and inform ation about special eve n t s.
The card could be delivered, at no charge, to the
overnight-stay tourists when they book a hotel.
In this way, s e rious cultural tourists get a better
deal because they can more easily discover what is
on offer, and then arrange their itineraries expe-
diently and benefit from discounts. M e a n w h i l e ,
the city is better off because it attracts relat i vely high-
spending tourists who add to its profits from tou-
rism.
Diversifying 
the economy
I n f o rm ation systems such as these will be gi ve n
a test run during the Jubilee 2000 celebrat i o n s ,
when Italy expects an enormous inflow of tourists.
The A L ATA part n e rship of nort h e a s t e rn Italian
cities will use an inform ation system designed to
manage and distri bute visitor flow by telling pil-
grims how heavily booked  cities are. If a city’s
hotels are  full, the system will redirect tourists to
other localities for accommodat i o n .This is an emer-
gency measure aimed at coping with celebrations
r ather than providing incentives for certain types
of cultural tourism. But it is a first attempt to use
m o d e rn telecommunications technology to full
advantage.
At the moment, within the Venice city adminis-
tration,the idea of “soft controls”seems to be gai-
ning support. Pilot projects are underway for the
creation of a network connecting cultural institu-
tions. Much more needs to be done.
But Venice needs not only to manage its touri s m
b e t t e r , but also to dive rsify its economy. In a review
of sustainable development options for Ve n i c e ,
s c h o l a rs Enzo  Rullani and Stefano Micelli suggest
that Venice could become the capital of a metro-
politan area specializing in producer serv i c e s ,f r o m
d ata processing to software design and finance;
cultural industries such as musical and theatrical
productions; and other activities from research to
p r oviding convention serv i c e s.This requires a system
of fast transport to reconnect Ve n i c e , an island that
is relatively difficult to get to and from, to the rest
of the region.
Another vision is that of Venice as the capital of
hi-tech and data processing, overcoming its phy s i c a l
i s o l ation through electronic accessibility.W h at e ve r
approach is used, it is now recognized that if the
culture of Venice is to remain a living entity the
city needs to be refashioned into a place that exists
for more than tourism. n
Rain or shine, Venice is a crowd-puller, but the city is trying to cut down on day-trippers.

years old, he is the only remaining practitioner of
this art.
“There used to be 12 of us in this neighbou-

Nearby, the local children and a handful of tou-

include music, traditional drawing, weaving, and

maintain the intangible parts of our cultural heri-
tage like dancing, music, poetry and puppetry,
and develop and pass them on to the children,”
says Khamphouy Phommavong, the local repre-
sentative of the ministry of culture. “Traditional
music is still alive and dance is starting up again.
Tourism is helping this to happen.”
A cautious opening
Luang Prabang has taken on a new lease of
life.The former capital of northern Laos, on the
banks of the upper Mekong river, it was harshly
treated by the rulers who took power in the 1975
revolution, abolished the monarchy and set up
the People’s Democratic Republic of Laos.
Some of the city’s inhabitants were sent to re-
education camps. The city withdrew into itself,
many houses became derelict, the shops on the
main street closed down, the pagodas were deser-
ted and traditions faded out. Few tourists ventu-
red into what was almost a ghost town. Things
slowly began to change in the 1990s, as the
government—which had sought to introduce “a
new way of thinking” and then “new economic
methods”—became more flexible and the coun-
try opened up economically.
And now the city, which today has 60,000
inhabitants, has come back to life. Since 1995,
many small businesses and restaurants have ope-
n e d . And tourists have returned to Luang
Prabang, increasing from 19,000 in 1996 to
44,000 in 1998, according to official figures.The
city now has 45 hotels, compared with only six in
1993.
The authorities have always been cautious,
fearing that a too sudden upsurge in tourism
would bring with it drugs,prostitution and dama-
ge to the environment. Nevertheless, entry into
Laos has been made easier. Visitors no longer
have to go through government-approved travel
agencies or get special permission to drive around
the country. Since 1997, entry visas have been
issued on arrival. Also, the decision to declare
1999 and 2000 as “years of tourism” perhaps
indicates a change of heart by the government, or

at least some people in it. At any rate, official
figures show that last year tourism became the
country’s main source of income.
The traditional way of life in Luang Prabang is
one of its charms for the alert stroller. N o i s y
m o t o r - b o ats on the Mekong have been banned
and have to keep their distance from the city. T h e
r e l i gious life of the monasteri e s , goldsmiths at
wo r k , women we aving among the stilts support i n g
the houses and old ladies taking offerings to pago-
das are scenes that captivate touri s t s.
Visitors are more numerous when the city’s
famed religious or ethnic festivals are going on.
The main event, the Laotian New Year in mid-
April,features parades,dances and the procession
of the Buddha Phra Bang, the city’s spiritual
guardian. As well as these festivities, which have
recovered their former spirit,there are a variety of
family celebrations, which passing visitors are
often generously invited to join in.
This cultural renaissance goes side by side
with the longer-term job of preserving the city’s
architectural standards, which has been a matter
of concern for the last decade. “In 1990, all we
planned was the partial restoration of the old
royal palace and the city’s finest pagodas,” says
Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy, director of museums
and archaeology in the national capital,Vientiane.
“Gradually we realized that the beauty of Luang
Prabang was something to be seen as a whole—
not just the religious buildings but also the houses
around them, and then nature itself, the jewel of
it all.”
A protected zone has been marked out in the
old part of the city and a preservation and deve-
lopment plan is almost ready. Plans for improving
sewage treatment are on the drawing board. A
broader urban development plan will enable deci-
sions to be made about future extensions of the
city and the startup of businesses near the new
stadium, just below the old town.
Since Luang Prabang was put on UNESCO’s
World Heritage List in 1995—600 of its buildings
are classified—many houses have been restored
along traditional lines. Koutis—monks’ dwellings
typical of the city’s architecture—have been resto-

red or rebuilt in their original form. The finest
pagodas have also been refurbished. Most of the
saffron-robed novices who can be seen in and
around them are children of needy families who
r e c e i ve secondary education in the pagodas
thanks to money donated by the faithful.
The House of Heritage has played a key role in
the successful restoration of Luang Prabang’s
architectural heri t a g e . It brings together seve r a l
g ove rnment ministries and attracts sizeable fun-
ding from abroad. “The streets and the quay s i d e s
of the Mekong and its tri bu t a ry were restored
firs t ,” s ays Laurent Rampon, a Frenchman who is
one of the three foreign experts working perm a-
nently at the House of Heri t a g e , of which he is the
main architect. “ We now want to clean and bri g h-
ten up the alleyways which lead to important bu i l-
dings such as the house of Lung Khamlek.” T h i s
big edifice perched on stilts is one of the rare
examples of Luang Prabang’s pre-colonial ari s t o-
c r atic architecture. Some outstanding wo o d wo r k
was crafted during its restorat i o n , which wa s
recently completed.
Tight regulations
for building and restoration
The people of Luang Prabang come to the
House of Heritage for help and advice on buil-
ding, repairing and extending houses in the pro-
tected zone. No building work can be done
without permission from the House,which makes
sure that projects harmonize with the style of the
old town. But the restrictions imposed by the new
regulations and concern for the general good are
not always accepted without complaint. Some
people are benefiting from tourism,but others see
the city’s listing as a World Heritage site as inter-
ference in their right to alter their houses as they
please or, for example, to fill in a pond at the bot-
tom of their garden.
Even the bonzes sometimes object to the new
rules. “Why do I have to ask someone who usual-
ly goes down on his knees before me what colour
tiles I’m allowed to use to mend the roof of my
pagoda?” asks one venerable monk who dislikes
not being absolute master in his monastery. A
scheme to help the bonzes will soon be under way
with Norwegian funding. In co-operation with
the Buddhist clergy it will seek to preserve the
authenticity of the religious heritage and revive
certain skills traditionally practised by the bonzes
such as stencil painting, enamelling, giltwork and
religious sculpture.
“ We want to rely on the people and see that
they benefit from protection of the heri t a g e ,” s ay s
Chansy Phosikham, Luang Prabang’s gove rn o r.
“ We also have to think about the social and econo-
mic development of the whole city.” A small tax on
t o u rism activities has been proposed. R a m p o n
s u p p o rts it because “it will enable us to subsidize
the use of traditional building mat e ri a l s , which are
c u rrently too expensive for many small house-
ow n e rs and also sometimes not ve ry good quality.”
It remains to be seen whether people will accept
such a tax.
Despite the problems, a lot has been achieved in
Luang Prabang. Some of it is due to we l l - p l a n n e d
foreign help, especially from the European Union,
UN E S C O and the French gove rn m e n t .“ N ow - f o r g o t-
ten building mat e rials such as whitewash and tradi-
tional plasterwork have been analysed in laborat o ri e s
a b r o a d ,” s ays Phommavo n g .“ We ’ ve also been helped
by experts who have worked with us for long per-
iods and who we ’ ve gradually learned from.And we
c o u l d n ’t have done it all without the tireless help of
Y ves Dauge.”
D a u g e , the mayor of Chinon in central
France, and a member of the French parliament,
has set up “decentralized co-operation” between
the administration of the two cities (something
new for Laos) and has lobbied for Luang Prabang
at international level. He says the Laotians were
suspicious at first, but then came to trust him, as
they have retained control of the operat i o n s
throughout.
Laotian culture ministry officials reckon that
what has happened in Luang Prabang has signifi-
cantly changed the way people think. It has led to
“the drafting of regulations and especially a new
attitude by the authorities to the question of heri-
t a g e ,” s ays Sayavo n g k h a m d y. “Officials come
from elsewhere in Laos to see what’s being done
in Luang Prabang and to get ideas from it.”
But “the most wonderful thing” about Luang
Prabang is “the kindness and generosity of its
inhabitants,” says Santi Inthavong, who has resto-
red a former royal residence and turned it into a
hotel. “This heritage is so fragile that I wonder
whether it will survive the growth of tourism.” n
Luang Prabang is famed for its traditional houses with wood façades.
‘ We want to rely 
on the people and see 
that they benefit from protection 
of the heritage’
Only through travel can
people mature.

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
Will tourism save the ksars and kasbahs of
the valleys and oases of southern
Morocco? Perched on rocky crags, these
f o rtified buildings made of compacted eart h
mixed with water and chopped straw are a draw
for foreign tourists in search of unusual architec-
tural sites. One jumping-off point to see them is
Ouarzazate in the Atlas Mountains, 200 kilo-
metres south of Marrakesh. This remote and
ancient little town has become a busy tourist
centre. With a total 5,502 beds in its officially-
approved hotels, it attracts more than 450,000
overnight visits every year.
The Ouarzazate region contains 300 of the
thousand or so kasbahs that have been identified
in Morocco. These structures, which come in all
sizes, are notable for the beauty of their architec-
ture and their imaginative use of space. But they
are also fragile and many of them are extremely
dilapidated.
Single-family dwellings in fortified villages or
ksars, into which there is a single entrance, kas-
bahs are remarkable for their defensive architec-
ture, usually featuring towers atop each of their
four corners. The upper parts of some of these
two- or three-storey buildings, which have roof-
terraces resting on beams made from the trunks
of palm-trees, are lavishly decorated.
Fragile and dilapidated
The earthen building material of these fragile
constructions does not stand up well to the
ravages of time and the weather. A ksar only
remains intact for about two centuries. In the
past, its occupants would then leave and build
another ksar nearby. But social and economic
changes in Morocco and the region at large in
recent decades has dealt a heavy blow to the
constant renewal of the ksars.
The end of the trans-Saharan caravan trade,
the disappearance of insecurity, the emergence of
a centralized nation-state and the spread of tele-
vision (reception dishes seem to sprout from all
the dwellings) have all helped to overturn the tra-
ditional way of life in oasis societies. Nowadays,
communities whose members have not emigrated
to more prosperous regions use cinder blocks to
build small houses outside the old walls and
mosques made of stronger material. These buil-
dings are too hot in summer and too cold in win-
ter, but some of them have basic amenities such
as water and electricity.
However, recent events in the village of Aït
Ben Haddou, a village about 35 kilometres from
Ouarzazate, show there is still hope for the ksars.
Thought to have been founded in the 11th centu-
ry, Aït Ben Haddou has six kasbahs and some 50

houses, all in ruins. Its inhabitants have moved
out and over to the other side of the wadi (river),
nearer to the main road. Today 84 families live in
this modern settlement.
A masterpiece of architecture and landscape,
the old village of Aït Ben Haddou was included on
UN E S C O’s World Heritage List in 1987. It was the
first ksar to be preserved under a stat e - s p o n s o r e d
scheme to save the kasbahs of southern Morocco.
The progr a m m e , launched a decade ago by the
m i n i s t ry of culture and backed by the United
N ations Development Programme (UN D P) ,
UN E S C O and the World To u rism Organizat i o n
(WTO) , aims to foster tourism in the region as we l l
as saving endangered items of cultural heri t a g e .
Mixed results
The job has turned out to be an arduous one.
Standard restoration methods are little use because
the ori ginal building mat e rials are not ve ry strong.
They can only prolong the life of an earthen bu i l-
ding for a few ye a rs at most.The only effective way to
p r e s e rve a ksar like Aït Ben Haddou is to pers u a d e
the villagers to return to live in it and care for it on a
d ay - t o - d ay basis.To make it habitable, the ministry
of culture has asked other ministries for help. As a
r e s u l t , the public works ministry has looked into how
to improve access to the village, which is diffic u l t
when the ri ver is in full spat e .The education minis-
t ry has approved the building of a Koranic school
inside the ksar until there are enough children to jus-
tify opening a pri m a ry school.The national electri c i t y
board has agreed to install solar energy equipment.
But the number of people invo l ved and the maze
of bu r e a u c r a cy have meant only some of the goals
h ave so far been achieve d . Cleaning and preserva-
tion work has been start e d , architectural surveys of
the village houses have been made and a prov i s i o n a l
overall plan has been drawn up.The narr ow streets
h ave been pave d , the banks of the wadi strengthened
and a footbridge built to provide access to the ksar
when the water level ri s e s. R e s t o r ation and renova-
tion work has been done on some covered passage-
way s , the façades of houses, the mosque and the
most lav i s h l y - d e c o r ated bu i l d i n g s.
But the village has not yet come back to life.
Its only inhabitants are three families which never
went away because they were too poor.
Developments that might lure residents of the
new village outside the walls to move back into
the old one—such as building an access road and
a proper bridge over the wadi and providing drin-
king water and electricity—are a long way off.
There are several reasons for this. The minis-
tries of culture, housing and tourism are not co-
ordinating their efforts.There is also a shortage of
funds because of a general decision to cut public
spending. Finally, legal tangles are holding up
work on restoring the houses because the owners
of the kasbahs—several heirs who are mostly joint
owners—now live elsewhere in the country or
even abroad.
Because of these problems, the authorities have
o f ficially dropped plans to include Aït Ben Haddou
and the kasbahs of the south in the list of local tou-
rist “ p r o d u c t s ” .They are deemed too fragile and pre-
cious to be able to stand up to mass touri s m .
But the inhabitants of the village have not
given up hope of getting some income from tou-
rism and have taken up where the government
has left off. Several foreign films have been made
on the site and the paving of the access track has
spawned a modest tourist infrastructure. Twenty-
five bazaars and souvenir shops have been ope-
ned, eight of them in the old village, as well as
four café-restaurants which also offer lodging.
Some emigrants who have returned from
abroad have even taken a chance by building a
couple of small hotels. Many organized excursions
from Marrakesh and Ouarzazate now include a stop
at Aït Ben Haddou, which is attracting around 400
visitors a day.The money from this has helped the
inhabitants of the new village to do up their houses
and buy an electricity generator.
Restoration work inside the ksar is slowly
going ahead, and the local people have set up the
Aït Aïssa A s s o c i ation for Culture and
Development, which keeps a close eye on the res-
toration work and takes part in meetings about it.
Aït Ben Haddou even seems to have started a
trend. In a number of other villages people have
recently started restoring kasbahs and converting
them into small hotels. n
Classical restoration techniques are of little help in safeguarding the fragile architecture of
southern Morocco’s ksars. One solution would be to draw back villagers who have abandoned
these fortified villages.
Many organized excursions 
f rom Marra kesh and Ouarzazate 
now include a stop at Aït Ben Haddou,
which is attracting around 400 visitors 
a day. The money from this 
has helped the inhabitants 
of the new village to do up their houses
and buy an electricity genera t o r.
But I was impelled by
a resolute spirit and
the desire to visit
these illustrious
sanctuaries was
hidden in my bosom. .

my dwelling just as

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
He never dreamt he would return to a free country.
But nearly fifty ye a rs after fleeing his nat i ve
H u n g a ry, Lazlo Karolyi is now occupying one
wing of the 140-room castle where he lived until the
age of 12 before fleeing the advancing Red A rmy with
his fa m i l y. After the 1956 Hungarian upri s i n g, t h e
c a s t l e , a 19th-century neoclassical jewel located outside
B u d a p e s t , was turned into a centre for abandoned
c h i l d r e n .“There was absolutely nothing left in it,” s ay s
Karolyi in a polished British accent. In a pat t e rn found
to different degrees throughout Central Europe,
collections were dispersed or simply destroye d .“ We
had a library of 30,000 French and Latin manuscri p t s
t h at were bu rnt in the court yard in 1949.My parents
bu ried some silver and china in the grounds when they
left that we have found again.”Two ye a rs ago,K a r o l y i
accompanied his 88-year-old mother over from the
United States to attend a charged reinstat e m e n t
c e r e m o ny :the Red Star adorning the front of the castle
was removed and proudly replaced with the restored
family crest.
Feasibility studies
Now, in his wish to give the neoclassical palace
a fresh lease on life,Karolyi is taking part in a pro-
ject that will eventually transform some 30 to 40
a ri s t o c r atic residences into a chain of top-notch
châteaux-hotels spanning four countri e s — H u n-
g a ry, S l ova k i a , Czech Republic and Poland—a route
running from the Danube to the Baltic.
Launched in the early 1990s, the initiat i ve is the
brainchild of Christian Dromard, a Frenchman
specialized in the field of heritage and tourism. In
a context of restructuring in dire economic condi-
t i o n s ,t o u rism from the West was viewed as a poten-
tial source of revenue for Central European coun-
t ri e s , but restoring the regi o n ’s considerable we a l t h
of castles could hardly be deemed a pri o rity for
financially strapped governments.
As part of a Council of Europe working group
on cultural heritage and tourism in Eastern Europe,
Dromard put forward a few basic deve l o p m e n t
principles to partners from the region.“The basic
premise is that the upgrading of the castles had to
be seen as part of an investment and tourist deve-
lopment programme that would help to fin a n c e
r e s t o r ation and gi ve historic monuments an income-
generating activity while playing up their cultural
value.This was readily accepted.”
As such,with cultural and tourist authorities in each
c o u n t ry,Dromard has spent the past six ye a rs dru m-
ming up financial support for his cause while trave l i n g
across Central Europe with experts on restorat i o n
and hotel development to select ideal settings.“ H e ri-
tage is not a business like any other.The bottom line
is that the historical and cultural potential of the bu i l-
dings must be safeguarded,”s ays Karel Nejdl, head of
the Czech To u rist Board. Feasibility studies we r e
conducted for a number of locat i o n s.While the firs t
châteaux-hotels will be near capital cities, the project

are still largely unexplored by we s t e rn trave l l e rs.

“The idea we have been trying to get across is that
monuments are part of a country ’s tourist offeri n g .A s
s u c h , they should be regarded as an infrastru c t u r e
i nve s t m e n t , just like the building of an airp o rt or a road.
This was the only way that external funding could be
obtained for the project,” said Dromard. E x p e ri e n c e
s h ows that revenue from tourism alone can rarely
p ay off the cost of restoring castles—Dromard set
the average cost at around 30 million French francs ($5
million)—hence the need for state funding and long-
t e rm development loans. G r a d u a l l y, over the past
d e c a d e , perceiving restoration in the context of eco-
nomic development has made its way in intern at i o n a l
financial circles.
Catering with a local flavour
In the past two ye a rs , the World Bank and the
Council of Europe have made historic monuments eli-
gible for financial aid progr a m m e s. As a result, t h e
H u n g a rian end of the project recently obtained a
green light from the Council of Europe’s Fund for
Social Development while the gove rnment has
a p p r oved the granting of low-interest loans under
s t ate guarantee, also for restoration purp o s e s. In the
Czech Republic, if a contract is finalized this fa l l , it will
be the first case of intern ational financing for Czech
t o u ri s m . Although sites have been selected in Slo-
vakia and Po l a n d ,financing has been slower in getting
off the gr o u n d ,c h i e fly due to political and adminis-
t r at i ve setbacks.
At his end,Dromard and other pri vate part n e rs will
finance the cost of outfitting the castles with modern
fa c i l i t i e s ,h i ring British or French decorat o rs and local
a rt experts for refurbishing the interi o rs , and fin d i n g
m a n a g e rs ,chefs and staff who will understand the art
of cat e ring with a personal and local touch. T h e
interest for the stat e ,s ays Dromard, is that the operat o r
is responsible for the upkeep of the site for a gi ve n
p e riod of time and eventually sells the business back
to the ow n e rs—whether pri vate or public.
Finding new vo c ations for Central Europe’s ri c h
h e ritage of castles might be the only way of saving many
of them from decay. M o s t , over the past half century,
were stripped of their glamour after being confis-
c ated and declared state propert y. A select few
remained open to the public and were furnished to
r e flect a particular theme. Po rtraits and religious art
were kept sealed in reserve s. But for the most part ,
palaces were transformed into orp h a n a g e s ,b o a r d i n g
s c h o o l s , centres for the disabled, retirement homes,
summer camps,hospitals or state fa rm s.Some serve d
as hunting lodges for the nomenklat u r a . Until the
early 1990s, the Red A rmy installed its headquart e rs
and barracks in Gödöllö, the Hungarian summer
residence of Emperor Franz Josef and Queen Elisa-
beth—Empress Sissi.
After the fall of the Iron Curt a i n , new gove rn m e n t s
were faced with restitution claims,but only the Czech
Republic passed a law by which families or their des-
cendants could reclaim their propert i e s , on condition
they had kept their nationality and could prove they
had not collaborated with Nazi Germ a ny. In the end,
only 10 to 20 per cent of the country ’s castles were res-
tituted to their former ow n e rs. But while going back
to one’s roots after long ye a rs of exile may bring a sense
of justice restored, the responsibility is not a light
o n e .Dr Radslav Kinsky,a medical researcher who fle d
C z e c h o s l ovakia in 1958, is now spending his retirement
d ays managing Zdar, f o l l owing the restitution  of the
1 7 t h - c e n t u ry castle to him. S l ated to be on the châ-
teaux-hotel circuit, p a rt of Zdar will be transform e d
for this purp o s e , while the family also envisages ope-
ning a cultural centre there,gi ven the locat i o n ’s prox i-
mity to the chapel of St John of Nepomuk, a Wo r l d
H e ritage site. With forestry revenue earned on his
6,000-hectare estat e , Kinsky has financed the resto-
r ation of the fa ç a d e ,the roof as well as some of the cast-
l e ’s frescoes.
Although in Hungary castles are still officially the
p r o p e rty of the stat e , the Karolyi family has created a
f o u n d ation for the restoration of their expropri ated pro-
p e rt i e s , and more generally, to promote cultural
exchange with we s t e rn Europe. When the stat e
launches a public tender this fa l l , Karolyi hopes to win
it and lease the castle for a 99-year peri o d .“ G r a n t e d ,
in Hungary there’s a type of nostalgi c, romantic fa s-
c i n ation with castles, with associations cropping up to
s ave them,” s ays Tamas Fe j e r d y, a historic monu-
ments expert and country representat i ve for the châ-
teaux-hotels project since its begi n n i n g . More impor-
tantly he notes, the country approved its first law on
h i s t o ric monuments last ye a r ,which clearly delineat e s
the role of the state in mat t e rs of safeguarding.H i s t o ri c
monuments have beeen placed under the juri s d i c t i o n
of the cultural ministry instead of the env i r o n m e n t .
Funding has also been boosted.“The new gove rn m e n t
clearly considers that Europe’s dive rsity can be
enhanced through the promotion of our heri t a g e ,” s ay s
Fe j e r d y.
This is also one of the goals of the Karolyi fa m i l y.
Without any descendants, they are intent on trans-
mitting their heritage to future generat i o n s. “ E ven if
we had developed along the same lines as the We s t , we

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
For the last holy year of the millennium,Santiago de Compostela is organizing over one thousand cultural events.
The right ro a d

I n v e s t m e n t , political commitment and respect for heritage have turned a religious centre 
into a cultural attraction for millions of tourists
w UNESCO Courier journalist
“B uen camino!”—“Have a good journe
For centuries, hundreds of thousands of
p i l grims from Denmark, the Netherlands,
Italy, France and Portugal,have used this Spanish
phrase to greet each other as they trek along one of
the nine pilgri m s ’ routes to Santiago de Compostela
in northeastern Spain.
In 1999, o f ficials reckon nine million touri s t s
will visit the city, where tradition says St Ja m e s
(Santiago in Spanish),one of Christ’s 12 apostles,
is bu ri e d . Some 150,000 of them will have offic i a l l y
qualified as pilgrims by cove ring in a spirit of
c o n t e m p l ation at least 100 kilometres of the journ e y
on foot or horseback or 150 kilometres by bicycle.
The rest will have come by plane, train, buses or
cars,drawn by a $30-million programme in which
about a thousand events are being staged with fun-
ding from national, regional and local authorities.
Light and sound displays,exhibitions and classical
and modern dance performances will make sure
that the last Holy Year of the millennium will be a
memorable cultural occasion in Santiago de Com-
postela.

UNESCO AND CULTURAL TO U R I S M
Promoting better co-operation between all the stakeholders of tourism is one of UN E S C O’s
main strategies for bringing about more culturally-sensitive policies in this growth industry.
During the UN-proclaimed World Decade for Cultural Development (1988-1998), t h e
organization struck up partnerships with the World Tourism Organization (WTO) , the Wo r l d
Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UN D P) , as well as private business,
site managers and experts to encourage a more in-depth reflection on how tourism can benefit
or harm heritage and cultures. The goal, beyond promoting research and awareness at all
l e v e l s, is to help states formulate long-term strategies for safeguarding cultural heritage,
giving tourists the tools for better understanding it, and ensuring that local populations
participate in,and benefit from,the development of tourism.
Besides providing expertise for drawing up World Heritage site management plans, UN E S C O
supports a range of cultural tourism projects. O n e, run in co-operation with the Universities of
Venice and Rotterdam, involves setting up a network between 20 European historic cities on
how to better manage tourist flows and present heritage in more comprehensive wa y s.
Another focuses on drafting a code of conduct with private and public stakeholders for the
S a h a r a , an environmentally fragile region where tourism is expected to grow. As part of
UN E S C O’s Memory of the Future project, funds were secured in 1999 from several tour operators,
hotel chains and agencies for cultural heritage programmes in Petra (Jordan), A n g ko r
(Cambodia) and Machu Picchu (Peru).
To u r i s m ,fin a l l y, is about promoting a richer dialogue between cultures.This is the essence of
several international scientific projects,which have all acquired a tourism dimension in the past
d e c a d e : the Slave Route project, in co-operation with WTO, foresees the inventory,p r e s e r va t i o n
and restoration of historic monuments and places of memory linked to the transatlantic slave trade
in A f r i c a , the Americas and the Caribbean; the Silk Road initiative (also in partnership with WTO) ,
is gradually building up cultural tourism in Central Asian countries, and in the process seeking
to revive the memory of strong cultural ties that once linked countries of this region. n
years or so have been a second golden age for the
p i l grimage to Santiago (the first was in the 11th
and 12th centuri e s ) , which continues to draw
crowds,whether for spiritual or cultural reasons.
In 1991, the Galician authorities launched an
ambitious programme to boost regional touri s m ,
focusing on Santiago and the pilgri m s ’ way. T h e
Spanish gove rnment and the eight prov i n c e s
through which the Way passes spent a lot of money
marking out the route, p r e s e rving its historical fea-
t u r e s , refurbishing hotels for pilgrims and bu i l d i n g
f o o t p aths for the pilgrims to use instead of the
roads.
P ri vate sector invo l vement was encouraged and
a mascot for the Way was created,named Pelegrín.
N ational and intern ational publicity campaigns
were launched, mostly through travelling exhibi-
tions including one called “In the Footsteps of
James”, which started out from Buenos Aires last
October 1 and by December 1999 will have visited
Mexico City, Munich,São Paulo, New York,Brus-
s e l s ,L o n d o n , Santiago de Chile, D u b l i n , Pa ri s ,To u-
louse and Bordeaux.
There is plenty of “ r aw mat e ri a l ” of cours e .T h e
old centre of Santiago de Compostela and its
baroque, neoclassical granite buildings have been
placed on UNESCO’sWorld Heritage List,and so
has the pilgri m s ’ way itself. In 1987, the Council of
Europe classified the entire complex of pilgri m s ’
routes to Compostela as a major “European cultu-
ral itinerary”,describing it as “a repository of col-
l e c t i ve memory crossed by paths which defy dis-
tance, frontiers and incomprehension.”
And while maintaining its local atmosphere and
i m p r e s s i ve group of monuments centred on the
c at h e d r a l , the city has also tried to retain the pat t e rn
of urban development which in 1998 won it the
European Urban and Regional Planning Awa r d ,
the European Commission’s highest distinction in
this field granted every four years. The jury com-
mended the radical steps that have been taken to
halt the deteri o r ation of the old quarter and the
successful integration of new buildings and infra-
structures.
“The old city is now untouchable,” s ays Cri s t ó-
bal Ramírez, head of the Jo u rn a l i s t s ’A s s o c i ation of
the Road to Santiago. “Subsidies have enabled a
range of architectural work to be carried out to
maintain 17th- and 18th-century façades and stru c-
tures as well as the interi o rs of houses and other
bu i l d i n g s.To d ay, e ven if they only want to change a
t a p, ow n e rs have only four or five models to choose
from.”
With more than a dozen cultural events a day,
including round-table discussions, c o n f e r e n c e s ,
s h ow s , lectures and concert s , Santiago is decked
out in all its fin e ry. B e t ween now and the end of
the ye a r , its streets, restaurants and more than
8,000 hotel rooms will be filled with pilgri m s ,b a c k-
packers and other visitors. Then, just before mid-
night on December 31, the Holy Door of the cat h e-
dral will again be sealed with cement and bri c k s
until the next “holy year”,2004.
But the celebrations will not end with the cen-
t u ry, because Santiago has been designated by
European ministers of culture as one of the nine
“cultural capitals of Europe” for the year 2000,
along with Avignon (France), Bergen (Norway ) ,
Bologna (Italy), B russels (Belgi u m ) , C r a c ow
( Po l a n d ) , Helsinki (Finland), Prague (Czech Repu-
blic) and Reykjavik (Iceland).
Stones can’t talk, but Galicia is a land of
legends. On the Portal of Glory, the Romanesque
façade of Santiago’s cathedral,there is a carving of
the Prophet Daniel which features what is reckoned
to be the first smile in Romanesque art. From his
pedestal, Daniel seems to be looking down at the
t o u rists and—he too—wishing them “ B u e n
camino!”. n

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
He built an empire on the sands of some of the
wo r l d ’s most beautiful beaches by wheeling
and dealing with kings and presidents. H e
made a fortune by selling a sun-splashed brand of
hedonism with the trademark bikini-clad couple fro-
licking along a lick of white sand. Meet Gilbert Tri-
g a n o,one of the two men responsible for starting the
wo r l d ’s most famous network of resort s , the Club
M e d i t é rranée—better known as the Club Med.
At the age of 78,Tri g a n o ’s club-days are over bu t
he has found a new role as a consultant to govern-
ment officials on the tourism industry, which may
send shivers up the spines of those devoted to the
new school of cultural tourism. Club Med’s hall-
mark lazy get-away in which visitors need not
exchange money, let alone venture to a local res-
t a u r a n t , is often cast as the dark side of the industry.
“It’s become a sin just to use the expression ‘mass
t o u ri s m ’ ,” s ays Tri g a n o, “ but that ’s what we are
faced with. Should we be nostalgic and try to return
to the past when people didn’t travel in groups or
should we try to better control the flows?”
The spirit of the times
I r o n i c a l l y,Trigano cannot help but hark back to
Club Med’s early days in the 1950s, when the
r e s o rts consisted of tented camps on pristine beaches
of the Mediterr a n e a n . “The real success of the club
m ay not have been in the quality of the services bu t
in the way it represented the spirit of the times.We
[ Trigano and his business partner Gérard Blitz]
were young men, survivors of the war.We made a
profession out of offering others what we wanted for
ourselves: a chance to discover the sea, to breathe
deeply and live healthily. There was an incredible
desire to discover new things in life and new people.”
Trigano maintains that the same trends are
intensifying today.Yet there is a hollow ring to his talk
about discove ring other cultures.The clubs are and
have always been removed from surrounding life.
The flash of these pleasure domes often seems
indecent in poor countries. “It is very easy to criti-
cize along these lines,” s ays a visibly aggr avat e d
Tri g a n o, but the bottom line is that tourism bri n g s
much-needed money and jobs.
“Besides do you really think that anyone can
u n d e rstand the culture of a country like Mauri-
tius after visiting for eight or 15 day s ,” s ays Tri g a n o.
“ People at the club basked in the sun of Spain.
They tasted the tomatoes of Tunisia and the gri l l e d
mutton of the Berbers in Morocco. They didn’t
discover these countries but they did get a taste of
them.”
According to Tri g a n o, it would be irr e s p o n s i b l e
for the club to dive any deeper into local culture.“ I n
Indonesia,I used to pay actors to stage traditional
m a rriages because I was furious that people wa n t e d
to penetrate Buddhist temples to see a ceremony.
This would have been totally inappropriate.”
Trigano has just returned from Pa l e s t i n e ,
enchanted by the cultural heri t a g e . Yet he is
also concerned,explaining that the impending
recognition of the formal state of Palestine will
unleash a wave of tourists. “Now is the time to
a c t ,” s ays Tri g a n o. “It would be a bit far-fetched for
me to play the role of the moralist”and tell the Pa l e s-
tinians what to do, he say s. “It is a lot more plausible
for me to offer my experience as to how a ‘good idea’
can get out of hand.”
“My role used to be to look for isolated sites of
exceptional beauty,” s ays Tri g a n o, and then deve l o p
them by brokering deals with the gove rnment to
b ring electri c i t y, d rinking water and even small air-
p o rt s. “It is possible to discover and develop a
site without destroying it,” he insists. But what of
places like Cancún in Mexico, the Moroccan beach
r e s o rt of A g a d i r , or Tu n i s i a ’s Isle of Je r b a . In all
three cases, Club Med was the first to lay the
f o u n d ations for the tourism industry. I n d e e d ,w i t h
a certain pri d e , Trigano explains that when he
and his team arri ved over 30 ye a rs ago, “ t h e r e
was nothing.”Yet he is also the first to admit that
“they are now concrete horr o rs.” Was this
inevitable? “Not entirely,” he say s. For Tri-
g a n o, the error lies not in developing a site
but in ove r d e veloping it—and to avoid this,
“ a u t h o rities must have the courage to issue
l aw s ” to regulate the industry ’s gr ow t h . “ I ’ m
not ashamed of anything I have bu i l t ,” s ay s
Tri g a n o. As for the others. . . . nw UNESCO Courier journalist

“Bali was wonderful until your guidebook
came along,” said a member of the
a u d i e n c e ,d u ring a talk I gave recently about
the pitfalls of touri s m . “ W hy are you sending all
those visitors to Burm a ,d o n ’t you know how horri b l e
the gove rnment is?” q u e ried another, r ather angri l y.
Questions like these are raised almost eve ry
time I speak about my life as a guidebook publisher.
According to this line of reasoning, I should be
ashamed of myself for helping to ruin dozens of
places round the wo r l d , not to mention propping up
a string of corrupt regi m e s. In my view, the situat i o n
is rather different.
When my wife Maureen and I founded
Lonely Planet Publications over 25 years ago the
world was, from a tourism point of view, a much
less crowded place. I can easily measure that
growth by simply glancing at my bookshelf—our
first South East Asia on a Shoestring guidebook
covered the region in 144 pages. The latest 10th
edition takes 936 pages to do the same job, and if
you added up the individual guidebooks we have
for countries in the region they would tot up to
over 5,000 pages, an information overload no
visitor would contemplate carrying around.
Maureen and I put that first regional guidebook
together in a backstreet Singapore hotel room.
Our entire staff could fit into one car to go out for
lunch.Today they’re scattered around four offices
on three continents and it would be standing
room only in a 747.
Has big tourism ruined Bali?
We started with a ve ry simple philosophy : we
were the small-time operat o rs who couldn’t compete
head on with the big publishers in London or New
Yo r k . So we would produce guidebooks to the places
nobody had ever thought of writing about. In retros-
pect it was an amazingly clever idea. By the time the
“big guys”had woken up to the tourist boom that wa s
taking off from airp o rts all over the world we had
c a rved out a name for ours e l ves as publishers for the
new destinations suddenly topping the statistics lists.
This hard-won reputation gave us the stature to
m ove on to the more established and familiar touri s t
d e s t i n at i o n s.To d ay, h owe ve r , there are no undisco-
vered corn e rs. Name the destination and there are
probably half a dozen guidebooks about it.
So have we “ruined” Bali and dozens of other
untouched paradises? Have we demolished pristi-
ne cultures by drowning them in a never-ending
flow of tourists? Absolutely not. For a start we’re
only one influence amongst many. If guidebooks
were the huge influence many people seem to
assume they must be, airlines would be welco-
ming me aboard with open arms and upgrading
my tickets. In fact I’m just another anonymous
“bum on a seat”.
While many places have taken off as tourist
destinations during the last 25 years, Bali offers a
fine example of how the boom arises. Turn the
clock back to the 60s and you find a virtually tou-

THE EXPANDING GUIDEBOOK MARKET: A
SAMPLING OF THE LEADERS
The classic: In 1926, Brittany became the first of Michelin’s fine print green guides, a collec-
tion that now counts over 100 titles and is translated into nine languages including Japanese
and Hebrew. In 1997,the French publisher launched a more upbeat weekend escapade series,
which now counts 40 titles and is translated into English.
Still a bargain: First published in 1957,Arthur Frommer’s acclaimed Europe on $5 a day is still
geared to the value-conscious traveller. Only the figure in the title changes with the times—
up to $50 a day in 1999.Guides are published to over 25 countries and so far only translated
into Portuguese.
More upscale: Not for the backpacker market, Insight guides were launched in 1970 and now
cover 77 countries. Translated into 10 languages, including Chinese, Russian and Thai.
Bestsellers include guides to Australia,Canada, India and Thailand.
Asia first: Launched in 1973 with Across Asia on the cheap, Lonely Planet has expanded its
offer to 250 guidebooks. Bestsellers in English include guides to Southeast Asia, Western
Europe, India and Australia.So far, only translated into French.
Humour and value: Initially turned down by 19 publishing houses in 1973, the Guide du
Routard, a series valued for its refreshing, humorous approach and lists of good value hotels
and restaurants, now boasts 75 titles—all updated every year.
Steady growth: Rough Guides entered the market in 1982 with a title on Greece and have
since grown to a collection of over 100 guides that pride themselves on providing in-depth
coverage with a writer’s touch.Bestsellers are not guides to countries but to the Internet and
events of the millennium. Translated into 12 languages.
Show and tell: In 1992, the French publisher Gallimard inaugurated a new guidebook
concept—Eyewitness Guides—in which illustrations such as 3D and cutaway views of
palaces, monuments and museums take on just about as much importance as the text.The full-
colour, glossy collection now counts 90 titles with translations into 13 languages, including
Chinese and Polish. n

Tourism and culture : rethinking the mix
All travel has its
advantages. If the
passenger visits better
countries, he may
learn to improve his
own, and if fortune
carries him to worse,
he may learn to enjoy
it.
Samuel Johnson,English
scholar and critic (1709-1784)
rist-less Bali—not because we hadn’t published a
guidebook about the island Jawaharlal Nehru, the
first prime minister of independent India, dubbed
“the morning of the wo r l d ” . In fa c t , t h e
Indonesian government was distinctly unwelco-
ming to all overseas visitors. But even the subse-
quent change in government did not suddenly
open the floodgates of tourism. Bali didn’t take
off as a major international destination until air-
lines started scheduling regular flights, until big
hotels were built, until the island’s small, specia-
list image and reputation was disseminated to a
mass audience.
Has this leap to big tourism ruined Bali? Well,
first of all tourism is not the only agent of change.
Recent Asian economic mayhem apart , I n d o n e-
s i a ’s economy has been on a roll for the past 20 ye a rs
which Bali has clearly been a part of, whether it’s
been the green revolution doubling rice output or
the cottage industry clothing manufa c t u ring making
“made in Bali” a familiar label wo r l d w i d e . C u l-
tural changes have also taken root independently of
those linked to touri s m .I t ’s hard to believe that tou-
rism has a tenth of the influence of the Hollywood
videos now found in even the most remote cor-
ners of the world.
Tread lightly and 
be culturally aware
So tourism is not the only agent of change but
has it had such a terrible impact? Clearly, i t ’s brought
in a lot of money.We old Bali hands may regret how
much noisier, h ow much more crowded and
modern the island has become. However, I doubt
whether you’ll find many Balinese complaining.
Park the motorcycle and go back to walking to the
market? No thanks. Flick the lights off and go back
to oil lamps at night? Not a chance. And most
i m p o rtant of all, go back to the days when harve s t s
were uncertain and rice shortages were a regular
occurrences? Well would you?
Progress does not necessarily take a toll on
culture. In fact it’s often quite the opposite, and
again Bali is a fine example of the positive effects
of tourism. The island’s much-vaunted artistic
skills were essentially moribund when the first
Western visitors turned up in the 1930s. They
prompted a revival but nothing compared to
today’s artistic boom. Sure there’s a lot of mass
market art being churned out but that’s just a
broad foundation for a smaller output of higher
quality work. In Bali tourism has contributed to
change but this change has certainly not ruined
the place. The dancers may be performing for
tourists in hotels rather than the nobility in the
palaces but they are still dancing. Quite possibly
they wouldn’t be if there weren’t such a high
demand among visitors.
I believe guidebooks have played a positive part
in that change and in part that ’s because guidebooks
h ave changed as we l l .The modern guidebook is fa r
more than just a list of hotels, restaurants and “ h ow
t o ” i n f o rm at i o n . We firmly believe that better
i n f o rmed visitors are not only better visitors but also
visitors who enjoy themselves more. If you know
something about the dance, the music, the cere-
monies, the architecture, the food, the customs—
central elements of a culture—you enjoy the place
more. I think we’ve always been aware of that and
looking back at our early guidebooks I’m encou-
raged to see that we’ve always stressed the impor-
tance of fitting in, treading lightly and being cultu-
rally aware. We now have much larger budgets to
work with and can afford to put more time,energy
and expenditure in producing sections on specialist
cultural issues. Of course we ’re not alone in this acti-
vity, other guidebook publishers are equally aware
t h at a modern guidebook has to be much more
than simply a manual for the practicalities of trave l .
In countries like India with a wide range of reli-
gions some understanding of that rich backdrop can
make the travel experience immeasurably more ful-
filling and our India guide includes a section intro-
ducing the country’s varied range of religions. In a
r e gion like T i b e t , where religion underpins eve ry ele-
ment of everyday life, our guide tries to introduce
Buddhist iconogr a p hy, the importance of pilgri-
mages and the monastic lifestyle.
The evidence that modern travellers demand
this sort of coverage is easy to measure. Sure there’s
a lot more tourism these days but the gr owth in gui-
debook publishing has far outstripped the expansion
in the number of travellers.
Tourists appreciate that a good guidebook can
be a money- and trouble-saver that quickly pays for
i t s e l f, but they’re equally aware that it can make their
t r avels a more rewarding experi e n c e . I firmly believe
that travel and culture can live together,and good
guidebooks can help make that a reality. n

how much noisier, how much more

has become. H o w e v e r,

To w a rds an ethics o f t o u r i s m
w Cynthia Guttman
With pre s s u re on sites and cultures set to rise in the coming years, initiatives are multiplying 
to reduce tourism’s negative impacts and promote awareness at all levels
As glossy travel catalogues thicken by the year
and U.S. companies take reservations from
citizens hoping to become the first touri s t s
in outer space,concerted efforts are on the rise to
make the industry—and the traveller—more res-
ponsible.
O ver the past few months, the World To u ri s m
O r g a n i z ation (WTO) has been consulting NGOs,
businesses and gove rnments to draw up a Global
Code of Ethics for To u rism that will be presented
to its General Assembly in Santiago, C h i l e , in Sep-
tember 1999.“There are many vo l u n t a ry codes of
conduct produced by associations and companies
but there is really a demand from all the part n e rs in
the tourism industry for one simple reference that
could be a base for all other initiat i ve s ,” e x p l a i n s
W TO secretary-general Francesco Frangi a l l i .S u c h
codes aim to put forward guidelines that prov i d e
the industry and other stakeholders with an ove r a l l
f r a m e work for applying sustainable tourism prac-
t i c e s.
The first article sets the tone: “The actors in
tourism development and tourists themselves are
duty-bound to observe the social and cultural tra-
ditions and practices of all peoples, including nat i o-
nal minorities and indigenous people.” The code
condemns the “exploitation of other people in any
f o rm , notably sexual”and stresses that tourism poli-
cies should benefit local communities, c o n t ri bute to
p r e s e rving and embellishing heri t a g e , and allow
traditional crafts and folklore to flo u ri s h .A mecha-
nism of implementation will be proposed for solving
potential conflicts betwe e n , for instance, a tour ope-
rator and a host community.
Contradictory interests
While the World Council of Churches and other
a s s o c i ations started to draw attention to the des-
tructive impact of tourism on local cultures in the
late 1960s, it is only over the past decade that the
subject has turned into a much broader debat e ,
p a rtly dictated by the steady gr owth in the number
of intern ational trave l l e rs. For the first time, in A p ri l
1999 tourism was featured on the agenda of the
United Nations Sustainable Development Com-
m i s s i o n , which gat h e rs eve ry year to discuss fol-
l ow-up to the Rio Earth Summit. R e p r e s e n t at i ves of
i n d u s t ry, local gove rn m e n t s , NGOs and trade
unions broadly agreed that mechanisms had to be
put in place to ensure that tourism deve l o p m e n t
was sustainable—i.e. t h at long-term social and env i-
ronmental benefits are placed ahead of short-term
gains—and underlined the critical role that local
governments have to play in defining projects and
assessing to what extent they benefit their consti-
tuencies.
Underlying these trends is the notion that tou-
rism cannot be simply considered as a commercial
activity gove rned by market cri t e ri a .“ N ational tou-
rism policies have to be developed by multidiscipli-
n a ry teams that not only include tour operat o rs bu t
also archaeologi s t s , a n t h r o p o l o gi s t s , h i s t o rians and
g e o gr a p h e rs ,” s ays Doudou Diène, of UN E S C O’s
Division for Intercultural Projects. This strategy is
being promoted with WTO. C o n t r a d i c t o ry interests
m ay often be at stake.“ T h e r e ’s a strong lobby seeking
to cut down prices and taxe s ,” s ays Hervé Barr é ,o f
UN E S C O’s touri s m , culture and development pro-
gr a m m e . “On the other hand, c u l t u r e , from an eco-
nomic standpoint needs the price of entry tickets to
be high enough in order to cover costs.”
‘Respect makes for 
the best of encounters’
U l t i m at e l y, both pri vate and public sectors have a
role to play in safeguarding heritage and cultures
and also in educating visitors. In 1988, the Wo r l d

aimed at airlines and schools starring a cartoon cha-
racter who returns from extinction to help creat e
awareness of the impact of tourism on the env i r o n-
m e n t .The British NGO To u rism Concern has pro-
duced its first inflight video that highlights concern s
Gambians have about touri s m . It has also made a
video for secondary schools, which examines the
c o u n t ry as a destination through the eyes of adve rt i-

H U M A N I TA R I A N
I N T E RV E N T I O N :
A CONTROVERSIAL RIGHT
w Olivier Corten
The crisis in Kosovo has fuelled the debate between supporters and opponents of the right of
humanitarian intervention. The contributions below were made at the beginning of June 1999
n
The term “ ri g h t ” or “ d u t y ” o f
“ i n t e rvention”—to which the wo r d
“ h u m a n i t a ri a n ” was soon added—wa s
coined in the late 1980s by Mario Bettat i ,
Professor of Intern ational Public Law at the
U n i ve rsity of Pa ris II, and by the French
politician Bernard Kouchner, one of the
f o u n d e rs of the aid organization Médecins
sans frontières (Doctors without Borders ) .
As Kouchner put it, they were taking
issue with “the old-fashioned theory of stat e
s ove r e i g n t y, used to fend off criticism of
m a s s a c r e s.”The idea caught on quickly,
especially with the emergence of a new
world order in which values like democracy,
the rule of law and respect for human ri g h t s
were supposed to be top pri o ri t i e s.The need
to help peoples in distress would mean that
e ve ryone had a “duty to assist a people in
d a n g e r ” which would ove rride the
traditional legal rules.
Despite the generous intentions of its
advocates, the fuzziness of such a right
immediately raised questions and even
criticism. Was it simply a moral right or
was it a principle to be incorporated into
international law? For centuries, interna-
tional law has been based on the soverei-
gnty of the state.As a result,a state is only
bound by a legal obligation—especially by
an obligation to protect human rights—if
it has agreed to it by ratifying a treaty or
by adhering to an existing customary
rule. Human rights have widely varying
legal status all over the world,and persons
are better protected in some countries
than in others.
A challenge 
to sovereignty
S overeignty also means that a coun-
t ry which has violated human rights can-
not be prosecuted unless it accepts or
has accepted the authority of a court .
Except by going through regional bodies
such as the European Court of Human
Rights and the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights, it is thus ve ry hard to get
a gove rnment convicted of human ri g h t s
v i o l ations by an intern ational court . A n d
e ven if a conviction is obtained, there is
no way of guaranteeing the sentence will
be carried out. S overeignty has prove d

incompatible with the existence of a kind
of worldwide “international police force”.
The doctrine of “the right to interve-
ne” is an attempt to challenge this tradi-
tional legal structure by calling into ques-
tion the very concept of sovereignty it is
based on.The power of the state, it says,
must yield to a “principle of extreme
urgency”—the need for a minimum pro-
tection of human rights.
H u m a n i t a rian aid must therefore be
d e l i vered without regard to nat i o n a l
f r o n t i e rs , or whether or not a country
has pledged to respect a ru l e , the juri s-
diction of a court or the powe rs of an
i n t e rn ational police force. It is no longer
tenable to bow to legal formalism which,
as Kouchner say s , is tantamount to
accepting that it could be “ p e rm i s s i b l e ,
albeit discreditable, to massacre one’s
own people.”
M a ny legal experts have strongly cri-
ticized the view of traditional intern at i o-
nal law held by support e rs of the right to
i n t e rve n e . F i rs t , under no circumstances
can a gove rnment claim it is “ l aw f u l ” t o
massacre its own population on the
grounds that eve rything that goes on insi-
de the country is an “ i n t e rnal mat t e r ” .
All states have formally agreed that they
should respect fundamental ri g h t s , s u c h
as the right to life and respect for the
p hysical pers o n , and that genocide is
u n l awful as far as their own people are
c o n c e rned and therefore on their ow n
t e rri t o ry. They decided in “a sove r e i g n
m a n n e r ” to respect these pri n c i p l e s , s o
they must respect them in a sove r e i g n
manner too.
Where a massive violation occurs ,
retaliatory measures and reprisals can be
taken in political, diplomatic, economic
and financial ways. An embargo, even
without United Nations interve n t i o n ,
could be envisaged against a state or a
group which is violating a people’s most
basic rights. Such a measure, quite a for-
midable one, has been used against cer-
tain states, including Argentina at the
time of the Falklands war, the Soviet
Union after its military intervention in
Afghanistan and more recently against
Haiti and Burundi in response to coups
d’état in those countries.
The United Nations Security Council
can also declare that massive violations of
human rights are a threat to “ i n t e rn at i o n a l
peace and securi t y ” and duly authori z e
m i l i t a ry intervention (article 42 of the
United Nations Charter). It has done this
on several occasions (see box ) . So on closer
i n s p e c t i o n , most of the operations pre-
sented as arising from “the right of huma-
n i t a rian interve n t i o n ” are actually applica-
tions of existing legal mechanisms. It is
quite wrong to say that traditional inter-
national law is incompatible with effective
protection of human ri g h t s. In fact the pro-
blem is usually more political than legal, i n
the sense that what is needed is not new
rules but the better use of existing ones.
These political obstacles, e s p e c i a l l y
the right to exercise a veto in the Security
Council, mean that nobody is going to
claim international law is perfectly ade-
quate to protect human rights. But despi-
te the system’s shortcomings, many ana-
lysts think that it is less bad than one that
would include a broad right of humanita-
rian intervention.
The principle of non-intervention is
the result of a historic battle waged by the
weakest countries. Throughout the 19th
century, they were subjected to colonia-
lism and imperialism, which also made
themselves out to be defending “civilized”
values. On many occasions, the humani-
tarian argument was used to justify mili-
tary action by Western states against the
Ottoman Empire, as well as in Africa and
the Far East.
The United Nations Charter did not
put an end to such practices, but at least
it gave countries that were attacked the
opportunity to invoke the law to oppose
the use of force. A return to a situation
where there was a right to interve n e
which could, hypothetically, involve sides-
tepping UN decisions, would mean the
world’s most powerful states could set
themselves up as sole judges of what
humanity supposedly needs. Once again,
might would be right.
Colonial memories
The question of double standards is
often raised.How can one claim an action
is humanitarian if it clearly arises from
considerations of realpolitik, which are the
only possible explanation why some states
that violate the most basic human rights
Under no circumstances can a government claim
it is ‘lawful’ to massacre its own population
on the grounds that everything that goes on inside 
the country is an ‘internal matter’

ACTION ON GROUNDS 
OF ‘ H U M A N I TARIAN INTERV E N T I O N ’
The “right to intervene” came to public attention for the first time when military action against Iraq wa s
taken by several Western countries in April 1991.1 The operation was presented as a measure to pro-
tect the Ku r d s, who were being harshly oppressed by the Iraqi authorities. Respect for human rights
would from now on be enforced through action by the “international community”, through the appropriate
institutions or by certain states which were prepared to defend this principle. The United Nations Security
Council,as on all subsequent occasions, declared the situation a “threat to international peace and secu-
rity”.
The same reason was used by the Council to justify  Operation Restore Hope in Somalia from late 1992.
Officially, it was meant to put an end to anarchy there and restore conditions in which people could sur-
v i v e. In 1994, France carried out Operation Turquoise in Rwa n d a , ostensibly to protect its inhabitants from
a genocidal war that was tearing the country apart. On similar grounds there have also been military inter-
ventions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1994-95), L i b e r i a , S i e r ra Leone, Albania (1997) and in Ko s o v o
(1999). n
1 The international action against Iraq after Iraq invaded a sovereign state, Kuwait,is by definition outside the
purview of the “right to intervene”.

The member states of the Nort h
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
decided on March 24, 1999 to start the
m a s s i ve bombing of Yu g o s l avia on the
grounds that they were defending Kosova r
p o p u l ations of Albanian ori gin in the name
of the unive rsal values of the intern at i o n a l
c o m m u n i t y. Olivier Corten believes that
classic intern ational law, which would have
required a prior resolution by the UN
S e c u rity Council, was ignored on the
grounds that it was outmoded: a double ve t o
by Russia and China would have been a
f o rmal obstacle that was inappropri ate in
such an emergency.
Olivier Corten
Making Kosovo a milestone in the
gr owth of a right of humanitari a n
i n t e rvention may turn out to be ve ry
e m b a rrassing for its support e rs. It is virt u a l l y
impossible to say that , at the end of the day,
the intervention will have improved the
h u m a n i t a rian situat i o n .The deport at i o n s
and atrocities the Kosova rs of A l b a n i a n
o ri gin have been subjected to are not a
direct result of interve n t i o n , but that is
i rr e l e vant because the consequences of
intervention were not only foreseeable but
were predicted by many foreign observers.
And this is the dilemma. Either the
We s t e rn planners have good intentions bu t
h ave carried them out incompetently,
thereby losing all credibility as guarantors
of respect for the law, or else they are
c o m p e t e n t , but their motives are perhaps
less humanitarian than they publicly
proclaim.The second of these possibilities
clearly seems to be more likely.W h at ’s more,
N ATO ’s passivity in equally seri o u s
s i t u ations elsewhere (Angola, A f g h a n i s t a n ,
S i e rra Leone, R wa n d a , Kurdistan) makes
it even harder to defend the thesis of
“humanitarian”intervention.
This may be why many states refused to
s u p p o rt it. The Islamic world has widely
condemned the deport ations and at r o c i t i e s
but has not taken a clear stand on the
l e gi t i m a cy of military interve n t i o n .The Rio
G r o u p, which includes nearly all the Lat i n
A m e rican countri e s , has condemned the
d e p o rt at i o n s , atrocities and military
i n t e rve n t i o n , and has called for the United
N ations Charter to be respected. M o s t
member countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS, which embraces
most of the former Soviet republics) adopted
the same position.
I n d i a ’s representat i ve on the United
N ations Security Council said on March 24
t h at “no country,group of countries or regi o n a l
a rrangement can arr o g ate to itself the right to
take arbitrary and unilateral military action

THE FIRST LESSONS OF KO S OVO

are let off the hook? The Palestinian situa-
tion is the one most often cited in this res-
pect. This probably points to the funda-
mental problem raised by the “right to
intervene”—that it is not clearly defined.
M a rio Bettati (see below) illustrat e s
this ambiguity when he defines “the ri g h t
to interve n e ” largely in terms of opposi-
tion to a restri c t i ve , ri gid interp r e t ation of
s ove r e i g n t y. “The term just by itself has no
legal content,” he say s. “It only acquires
a ny when it is accompanied by the
a d j e c t i ve ‘ h u m a n i t a ri a n ’ . By virtue of the
p u rpose it gi ves to interve n t i o n , the adjec-
t i ve removes the unlawful aspect which
e ve ryone associates with it. A law ye r
would prefer the expression ‘ right to pro-
vide humanitarian assistance’, w h i c h
d e fines the purpose more clearly and
sounds less like a subjective and implicit
clash—which after all it isn’t—with the
anti-colonialist principles of ‘ n o n - i n t e r-
ve n t i o n ’ and ‘ n o n - i n t e r f e r e n c e .’ ”1
Ambiguities
And so it is hardly surp rising that this
d o c t ri n e , which might seem at t r a c t i ve in
t h e o ry, has led to and is still leading to
m a ny abuses in practice. The recent
example of the war in Kosovo may be seen
to embody all the ambiguities of a “ right to
i n t e rve n e ” e xe r c i s e d , in the name of the
i n t e rn ational community, by a coalition of
the wo r l d ’s biggest military powe rs. n

include countries as dive rse as Namibia,

claim that NATO ’s action reflects the will
of the “ i n t e rn ational community” as a whole

The attitude of NATO member stat e s ,
which say that the Intern ational Court of

hear the complaint lodged with it by
Yugoslavia,only confirms this fear.

right of intervention risks being associated
with a return to the gunboat diplomacy
which the authors of the United Nat i o n s

out to eliminate.
Mario Bettati
The intervention in Kosovo both is and is
not a question of the right of humanitari a n
i n t e rve n t i o n .To begin with,nobody disputes
that the Serbian regime is guilty of serious
human rights violations on its own soil, i n
K o s ovo. This is grounds for legal
i n t e rve n t i o n , and the recent indictment of
f i ve of its leaders by the Intern at i o n a l
C riminal Tri bunal for the Fo rmer Yu g o s l av i a
resoundingly confirms that.
The nature of the intervention has also
been tacitly accepted by the intern at i o n a l
c o m m u n i t y.The Security Council refused
on March 26, by 12 votes out of 15, t o
condemn the air at t a c k s. And on A p ril 16,
the UN Human Rights Commission, by 44
votes out of 51, condemned “ e t h n i c
c l e a n s i n g ” , while the opponents of this
c o n d e m n ation had stressed that it would be
tantamount to justific ation of the bombing.
These two votes provided an implicit legal
basis for the bombing. F i n a l l y, t h e
i n t e rvention was not unilat e r a l , as in a
classic colonial operat i o n , but multilat e r a l .
H owe ver the purpose of exercising the
right of humanitarian intervention is to help
the victims. F i rst by staying the hand of the
executioner. But not only have the victims
not been protected but the executioner has
gr own tougher: the announced aim of the
i n t e rvention and the result achieved by it
are poles apart . S e c o n d , by providing free
access to the victims so they can be helped.
H owe ve r , no humanitarian organization has
been able to set foot in either Serbia or
K o s ovo.T h i r d , free access is still without
the necessary support of an accompany i n g
a rmed force, in this case, i n t e rvention on
the ground.
The Kosovo precedent has adva n c e d
the cause of the right to intervene because of
the indictment, for the first time, of a sitting
head of stat e . It has also made people awa r e
t h at the right to intervene on humanitari a n
grounds is necessary, but it has shown that
in the field, the present half-measures are
giving a flawe d , e ven false view of its
a p p l i c at i o n . In short , the right has become
more popular, but the exercise of it to help
the victims has run into political obstacles.

WAR COMICS:
THE NEW REALISM
Comic strip authors today are tackling the horrors of war with a critical eye
n
August 1993. In shell-bat t e r e d
Sarajevo, three newborn babies, Nike
Hatzfeld, Leyla Mirkovic and Amir
Fa z l a gi c, are being fed with milk in
Kosevo Hospital. One is Croat, another
Serb and the third Muslim.But what does
that matter? All three of them have lost
their parents. They have come into a
world torn by suffering and they must
endure the same distress. They are chil-
dren of war.
w Spanish writer
Thirty-three years later, in 2026, their
paths cross again. They are now living in
a society where religious fundamentalism,
b i o l o gical manipulation and histori c a l
revisionism are the pillars of a system to
which they do not belong.They have lived
different lives, but their destinies have
been shaped by their common past, a
wound that refuses to heal.They are still
prisoners in a ruined hospital.
This is the story-line of Le sommeil du
m o n s t r e (“The Sleeping Monster”), a comic
book by the Yu g o s l av - b o rn French art i s t
Enki Bilal, published in 1998.Through its
richly textured narrative and drawing the
book broaches several key themes, i n c l u d i n g
the psychological impact of war. After the
rubble of wa r fare has been cleared away, t h e
emotional wounds remain, although they
are never mentioned by the military in their
c o m b at report s. Wa rs play havoc with
m e m o ries and feed our imagi n at i o n .F r o m
ancient times to today’s video games, war-
fare has been a common subject of fiction.
The “ p o e t i c s ” of destruction dominat e s
our my t h s , as a way of sublimating or exor-
cising violence. And comic strips are no
exception to the rule.
“To cry out in a city whose memory is filled with bombs and death is absurd,pathetic and pointless. . .” writes Enki Bilal in Le sommeil du monstre (“The Sleeping Monster”)
published by Les Humanoïdes Associés, Geneva,1998.

62 The UNESCO Courier - July/August 1999
A quick, superficial look at comic
books might gi ve the impression that
conflict is their dominant theme. Indeed,
some of the best-known series often turn
to fighting and brutality to resolve
conflicts. Some people think comic strips
are an invitation to aggressive behaviour,
even inciting people to violence. In fact,
the opposite is true these days. Some
comic books now contain sharp criticism
and lucid analysis of war. Gone are the
days when their pages were filled with war
propaganda.
Goodies 
and baddies
The 20th century has had its fill of
wa rs and hardly anywhere in the world has
been spared. H owe ve r , comic books deal
mainly with the Second World Wa r , w h i c h
has provided a seemingly inexhaustible
quantity of mat e ri a l . Trailing way behind
come the war in Viet Nam, the Korean
Wa r , the First World Wa r , the Spanish
Civil Wa r , the A l g e rian war of indepen-
dence and the Sino-Japanese wa r.
The setting is often the same: a land
devastated by explosions, burnt-out cities
and ravaged countryside. Only the geo-
graphical surroundings change. Through
impenetrable forests, across arid deserts,
frozen wastes or tropical islands, a soldier
makes his way, advancing or retreating
and observing the world around him.
With him, the reader can visit countrysi-
de which has either been spared mas-
sacres or has suffered their terrible conse-
quences. Most authors use a lot of back-
ground mat e rial and are scru p u l o u s
about details of history, weapons and uni-
forms. They know the credibility of their
story depends largely on such detail.
War is a subject that lends itself well to
a medium like comic books,just as adven-
tures and heroism often do. The charac-
ters frequently find themselves in extreme
situations. It is at such moments of great
tension, when the spectre of death looms
over the protagonists, that courage or
cowardice, self-assertion or trauma are
revealed. There’s no room for ambiguity
The characters in Hugo Pratt’s “Desert Scorpions”(1969),which is set in North Africa,feel no sense of patriotism. They are resigned to a situation they find revolting.Aware
that they are victims of interests beyond their control and caught up in the maelstrom of history, they try to make sense of their lives. In this state of general alienation,all
points of view are comprehensible—or at least justifiable. So soldiers of rival armies end up by fraternizing.As one of the characters puts it,real men have no flag.
“Stormtroopers”(1968),by the Italian artist Bonvi,is one of few comic strips to use war as a backcloth for humour. It deals with German soldiers in the Second World War
and replaces the usual stereotype of discipline and cruelty with one of stupidity and cowardice. Bonvi shows life on the sidelines of war, with troops more inclined to
malinger than to fight.He creates a theatre of the absurd with macabre overtones. The balloon in this frame reads:“Sergeant,I want you to tell the soldiers that when they
attend to their physical needs, they don’t have to stand to attention in the presence of an officer!”
The new authors criticize war by using humour,
attacking vested interests and analysing the psychology 
of the characters

on the battlefield. It’s a place of extreme
commitment and fierce loyalty to exem-
plary values and attitudes. Even today it
can still provide inspiration for epics.
Goodbye 
to propaganda
There are many kinds of comic strips
about war in which the characters per-
form heroic deeds in a sequence of adven-
tures. Although these stories explain nei-
ther the causes of the conflict nor the
interests at stake for each side, the beha-
viour of the characters makes very clear
who are the heroes and who are the vil-
lains. Pitted against tyranny, injustice and
appalling horrors are an almost reckless
courage and spirit of sacrifice. The two
sides may be engaged in a conflict bet-
ween different sets of values, but what
matters most is victory.
Over the years, this kind of one-sided
comic strip, typical of the 1940s and
1 9 5 0 s , has run out of steam. C o m i c
books have freed themselves from the
burden of propaganda and have become
more critical or analytical of people’s
behaviour.
They no longer rely exclusively on the
glorification of good guys and condemna-
tion of baddies. With the more relaxed
international atmosphere of recent years
and as the old conflicts fade into history,
“classic” war comic books are now rare. A
new readership has emerged, with a new
outlook dominated by a pacifist culture
The comic strip author who has gone deepest into the causes and effects of war is the Frenchman Jacques Tardi.In his comic book C’était la guerre des tranchées (“Trench
warfare”,1982),about the First World War, he deals bluntly with the stupidity of a civilian population which was swept along by a tide of patriotic fervour and supported the
fighting,and with the agony of a soldier living in a hell of blood and mud in the trenches. He shows the horror unleashed by officers who did not hesitate to sacrifice
thousands of men in the name of an absurd sense of honour. In this context,German soldiers are victims too. The only possible outcome is trauma, desertion or death.
and not much interested in stories that
praise patriotism or present the battlefield
as a theatre for courageous deeds and
heroic victories. Taking the opposite tack
to comic strips that peddle violent
conflict, the new authors criticize war by
using humour, attacking vested interests
and analysing the psychology of the cha-
racters. Among the most representative
figures of this trend are the Italians Hugo
Pratt and Bonvi, and the French artist
Jacques Tardi (see illustrations).
This kind of comic strip depicts sol-
diers who are paralysed with fear, know
little about the cause they are supposed to
be defending, and are mainly concerned
with trying to save their own skin.
Homesick, grief-stricken about their dead
comrades and horri fied by massacres,
they are also the victims of administrative
incompetence.The enemy rarely appears,
and when he does he’s depicted as a fel-
low unfortunate. In comic books of this
kind, the conflict is not a horizontal one
between two parties but a vertical one,
with a hierarchy obliging the soldiers to
defend interests that are not their own.
One example is a 1987 A m e ri c a n
series called The ’Nam (Viet Nam),whose
a u t h o rs , Michael Golden and Doug
Murray, presented a detailed and realistic
picture of the Viet Nam War. They told
the story of a group of U.S. marines who
d i d n ’t really understand why the wa r
began or what they were fighting for, and
who tried to get through it by making
friends with each other. More recently,
S a ra j e vo - Ta n go ( 1 9 9 6 ) , by the Belgi a n
cartoonist Hermann, revived the argu-
ment about getting involved in a war like
the one in Bosnia, where ethnic cleansing
happened because of the feeble diploma-
tic efforts of the United Nations and the
Western powers.
The most violent comic strips are
nearly always fantasies, with few historical
references. It is as if fantasy can soften the
cruelty of the scenes or at least set them
in a fictional context where there are
f e wer ethical requirements. But when
strips have a historical conflict as a back-
drop, authors these days are extremely
critical. Even when the story is set in the
midst of a conflict, a u t h o rs like the
Slovene Tomas Lavric in his “Tales of
Bosnia” (1997) avoid warlike postures.
Lavric recounts how, despite the war, eve-
ryday life goes on, with children playing
amid the snipers, old people looking for
pigeons to feed, politicians putting their
p e rsonal interests first and journ a l i s t s
trying to exploit the media possibilities of
disaster. The message is that in general,
war should always be condemned, whate-
ver its causes or aims.
The historical accuracy of the comic
books cited here, along with others such as
La guerra civil española (“The Spanish Civil
Wa r ” , 1978) by Antonio Hern á n d e z
Palacios, provides a reliable and congenial
basis for studying history in schools. Pala-

exercises
The opportunity to draw lessons from
these comic books arises not so much
from the pictorial reconstruction of the
conflict as from their approach and the
way problems are presented. S o l d i e rs
handle weapons, but ideas justify what
they do.The authors present a wide range
of opinions which can be analysed and
assessed in the classroom. One exercise
could invo l ve asking the children to
explain why the characters in the comic
strip behave as they do and to compare
each side’s motives with those of their
adversaries. The children could then go
on to discuss whether these differences
were worth fighting over.
Of course, such situations can only be
explained in a historical context. It might
also be useful to make the victors and the
d e f e ated switch sides so as to see, by reshuf-
Comic strips produced in a number of countries present a biased version of conflicts. One notable example can be
found in Chinese comic books of the 1950s and 1960s. With huge print runs and wide distribution,they spread a
deceptive view of communist war and revolution
ADVENTURE AND PROPAG A N DA
“Terry and the Pirates”, the cartoon strip the
American artist Milton Caniff (1907-1988)
began to draw in 1934, describes the adventures
of a little boy who travels the rivers and seas of
China fighting pirates and other rogues who are
plundering the region. The main attraction of
these adventure tales is the exotic nature of the
settings and the people living in them. When
Japan occupies China,Terry and his friends turn to
fighting invaders who are not explicitly named.
The story-line changes sharply in 1942 when
the United States comes into the war after the
bombing of Pearl Harbour. Terry signs up at the
Chinese air cadets’ academy and starts wearing a
U.S. military uniform. From now on, his only
enemy is the Japanese army and its many allies.
Oddly though, despite the change of enemy, the
strip kept its old title.
The enemy are no longer pirates but a regular
army. Yet the way problems are presented, the
fling the plot and the outcome, those ele-
ments of the dramatic structure that might
justify the victory of one side or the other.
Analysing this kind of comic book might
help va c c i n ate the world against future wa r-
like impulses. Comic strips could help us to
stay alert and prevent the monster of vio-
lence from waking up once again. n
Terry and the pirates by Milton Caniff.
way people behave and the outcome of situations
are virtually unchanged. The Japanese officers and
soldiers are shown with the usual characteristics of
an enemy—not only in their physical appearance
but in their lack of moral scruples. Terry and his
friends hardly change either when they join the
army. They continue hand-to-hand fighting and stay
within the law and above all respect ethical prin-
ciples.
The simplistic, all-or-nothing depiction of the
opposing armies is not due to the causes being
fought for or the historical context but to the diffe-
rent roles the characters play. These are people
who, by their behaviour, justify or debase the cause
of the country they represent. History has entered
the comic strip and adopted its stereotypes.
Although they wear the uniform of the imperial
army, the Japanese remain pirates, an emanation of
the evil that the hero must continue to fight.
Most war comics published in the 1940s and
1950s are based on this allocation of roles.
During these years of patriotic fervour, many
comic strip characters enrolled in the army, inclu-
ding Captain America and Mickey Mouse, and
fought against the Axis forces. The same thing
happened in the 1960s with the Viet Nam War, in
strips like Tales of the Green Beret (1966) by
Robin Moore and Joe Kubert. n

require ships at sea to be equipped to

the early part of this century has save d
countless ships and thousands of lives.
GMDSS has been developed and pro-
gr e s s i vely implemented since 1979.As more
and more ships adopted the new system,
coastal radio stations around the world have
been closing down their wireless telegr a p hy
(W/T) services as demand has decreased.
As midnight approached on Ja n u a ry

their final Morse signals in a profusion of
emotional messages, typical of which was
this from a group of Danish stat i o n s :
“Concluding an era of more than 90 years
of W/T service from Danish coast stat i o n s ,
starting in 1909. . . .This is the last trans-
mission for ever.”
Thus signed off with dots and dashes the
era of Morse telegr a p hy, a medium which in
the 19th century had created a revolution in

i n s t rument to achieve this by means of inter-
rupted electrical currents corresponding to
a prearranged code (see box ) .
In 1843, C o n gress allocated $30,000
to test his invention on a 40-mile (65-km)
line along the railroad from Washington to
Baltimore.This opened on May 24, 1844,
with the sending of the apposite phrase
“What Hath God Wrought!”,and within a
year pri vate companies came into being
with plans to run Morse lines to all parts of
America.
In 1866, after several earlier at t e m p t s , a
submarine cable linked Britain and Ame-
ri c a . By 1871 a cable had reached A u s-
tralia, and well before the turn of the cen-
t u ry most of the world was covered by a va s t
network of Morse lines.
A new industry
The Morse telegraph created an entirely
new industry which, amongst other things,
offered women for the first time an oppor-
tunity to take up a respectable career, that
of a telegrapher,outside their own homes.
Te l e grams became a way of life for bu s i n e s s
and for individuals, and many large orga-
nizations had their own telegraph offices.
In 1848, six New York newspapers
f o rmed the A s s o c i ated Press, s h a ring news-
g at h e ring and telegraphic serv i c e s. T h e y
hired their own lines and operating staff,a n d
by 1923 AP landlines across North A m e ri c a
totalled 92,000 miles (148,000 km) ser-
ving the interests of 1,207 member news-
papers.
M a ny famous people started their
careers in the telegraph industry. Thomas
Edison, the famous inventor, was an itine-
rant Morse telegrapher at the age of 17,
t r avelling thousands of miles throughout
the United States and Canada, taking job
after job as his fa n cy, or circumstances,
dictated.
Andrew Carn e gi e , the industrialist and
philanthropist, began as a messenger boy
and was a telegraphist for twe l ve ye a rs.
HOW IT W O R K E D
In its simplest form,each of two telegraph stations has
a Morse ke y, in effect a simple electrical switch; a bat-
t e r y ; and an electromagnetic receiving instrument
called a “ s o u n d e r ” . The two stations,which could be
a few or many miles apart, are linked by a single wire
strung on telegraph poles.A second wire is connected
to the ground at each station and the earth completes
the electrical circuit.
When the key in one station is held down, e l e c-
tricity passes along the line to activate the magnets
in the sounder in the other station. A hinged bar in
the sounder is pulled down towards the magnets,
making a loud click as it comes to the end of its
m o v e m e n t . Releasing the key switches off the
magnets and the sounder’s bar is pulled up by a
spring to make yet another click.
Depressing the key for a brief moment (a dot)
results in two clicks close together. Holding the ke y
down for a longer period (a dash) creates two
clicks further apart. A telegraph operator learned to
distinguish between the dots and dashes sent in
this way and thus read the Morse code.
The code received was transcribed manually
with pen and paper. Subsequent improvements in
speed and capacity were achieved by the inven-
tion of the typewriter, which dramatically increa-
sed receiving capability; and a semi-automatic
Morse key which greatly increased the sending
speed of manual Morse.
The greatest capital expense was the cost of
erecting poles and wires hundreds of miles across
country to carry telegraphic tra f f i c . In 1876
Thomas Edison invented a “ q u a d r u p l e x ” s y s t e m
enabling a single wire to carry up to two messages
in one direction and another two in the opposite
direction simultaneously. This created extra “ l i n e s ”
which did not have to be physically built.
Automatic high-speed sending and receiving
machines further increased the carrying capacity
of existing lines. n
This Morse receiver dating from 1889 is displayed in the telecommunications museum at Pleumeur-Bodou,in France.

Gene A u t ry, “the singing cow b oy ” , w h o
died in 1998 aged 91, was a railroad tele-
grapher in his youth before he became a
Hollywood star.
In the early days of broadcasting, a tele-
grapher accompanied A m e rican commen-
tators to sporting events, and special lines
were installed to connect the stadium to
the radio stat i o n .The telegrapher sent short
r e p o rts to the station describing the progr e s s
of the mat c h , and a “ s p o rt s c a s t e r ” u s e d
them to provide a “ l i ve ”c o m m e n t a ry on the
game as if he were there personally. One
broadcaster who worked in this way in the
1930s was Ronald Reagan,later President
of the United States.
A universal code
The code used on the A m e rican lines wa s
“ A m e rican Mors e ” ,which is not the same as
the intern ational code we know today.The firs t
M o rse line in Europe was between Hambu r g
and Cuxhaven in 1847, but the A m e ri c a n
code was not entirely suitable for the Germ a n
language with its diacritical letters. A new
extended code was therefore devised, i n c l u-
ding some new characters and some retained
from the A m e rican code.
As the telegraph spread to other
German states and to Austria, each state
devised its own va ri ation of the Morse code,
n e c e s s i t ating telegraphic translation to a
different code by an operator as messages
crossed state boundaries.
In 1851 the A u s t r o - G e rmanic Te l e gr a p h
Union adopted a slightly amended ve rs i o n
of the 1847 code for use in all states as part
of a unified telegraph system effective from
July 1, 1 8 5 2 .The new code spread to other
European countries and was finally adopted
for unive rsal use in 1865 by the newly
formed International Telegraph Union.
Later, some countries developed their
own versions of the code for internal com-
m u n i c at i o n s.A p a rt from the ori ginal A m e-
rican Mors e , which remained in use within
the United States, there are Arabic, Bur-
mese, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese,
K o r e a n ,R u s s i a n , and Turkish Morse codes,
and possibly more.
The European code, which finally
became the intern ational Morse code, wa s
the chosen communication mode for the
newly invented wireless at the end of the
19th century.
A good practical system of signalling
already existed between stations using metal
wires to carry their signals.The purpose of
early wireless was simply to replicate and
extend the scope of the Morse telegraph
without the need for wires between sta-
t i o n s. When wireless was found to be
capable of sending messages over gr e at dis-
tances it was adapted for use by ships at sea
which previously had no means of com-
m u n i c ation with land, or each other, e x c e p t
by visual signalling when close-by.
Inspiration for wireless
The most famous early use of Morse at
sea was when the Titanic struck an iceberg
and sank on the night of A p ril 14, 1 9 1 2 .H e r
t wo Radio Offic e rs , Jack Phillips and Harold
Bride, stayed by their radio until the last
m o m e n t , sending out CQD SOS messages
in Morse code calling other ships to their
r e s c u e .“ C Q D ” was a recognized mari t i m e
distress signal, and “ S O S ” was a new inter-
national signal due to replace it shortly.
Their calls were heard 58 miles (93 km)
away by the C a rp at h i a, which arri ved on the

the Ti t a n i c sank and rescued some 700 sur-
vivors. Over 1,500 people died in the tra-
g e d y, including Jack Phillips. B ride sur-
v i ved and although unable to walk or stand,
spent much of the time over the next four
days heroically helping the radio officer of
the Carpathia send a continuous stream of
messages from the surviving passengers to
their next of kin.
Military use
Morse telegraphy was used by military
forces in the Crimean Wa r , and in the A m e-
rican Civil War. In the First World War, it
was widely employed in trench wa r fare with
bu z z e rs replacing sounders. At the same
time early wireless telegr a p hy sets we r e
coming into use.
By the time of the Second World Wa r ,
although wired telegr a p hy was still used,w i r e-
less had become the preferred form of military
c o m m u n i c at i o n . It was also an essential part
of clandestine/intelligence operat i o n s ,p a rt i-
cularly in occupied Europe where Allied agents
risked detection,and their live s ,e ve ry time they
transmitted a message to London. M o rse by
radio also served as a vital communicat i o n s
link for the gr e atly increased use of aircraft in
wa rtime operat i o n s.
In most armed forces today Morse is no
longer taught as a standard form of com-
munication,although some operators still
l e a rn it as a special skill. In a recent unusual
a p p l i c at i o n , Sudan Pe o p l e ’s Liberat i o n
A rmy rebels fighting the gove rnment of
Sudan have been heard on short wave radio,
without Morse keys, vocalizing the code as
“dits” and “dahs”into microphones.
Not quite the end
The invention of radio signalled the
b e ginning of the end for landline Mors e , bu t
it took a long time to happen.While long-
distance radio services challenged the cable
c o m p a n i e s , the advent of the telepri n t e r
took a more immediate effect. B ri t a i n ’s Po s t
O f fice officially abandoned Morse in 1932,
although its use continued in the United
States and Australia until the 1960s.
The same process took place in other
c o u n t ries although from time to time
u n c o n firmed reports indicate that landline
Morse still survives in Mexico and India.
M o rse at sea has officially ceased, but it
has not yet disappeared. Some stations and
ships are still actively carrying Morse traffic,
mostly in the developing world, but some
European stations can also be heard.The
high cost of installing new equipment in
the ships is the main reason for the delay in
c h a n ging to GMDSS, but also training fa c i-
lities have not been able to keep up with
demand.
There is still one major user of Morse
code. Radio amateurs worldwide use it to
communicate with each other because of
t wo adva n t a g e s. It has an intern at i o n a l l y
understood system of abbreviations which
aids communication between people who
are unfamiliar with each other’s language;
and Morse radio transmission is a part i-
cularly effective means of getting signals to
distant places compared with other radio
modes—the same advantages that made it
so valuable for maritime use.
Landline Morse is also kept alive by
hobbyists. In America, Canada and Aus-
t r a l i a , enthusiasts mount historical display s
and communicate with each other using
original keys and sounders via the public
telephone system, dial-up units, a n d
modems. n

When Morse is sent by hand,every operator has
his or her own characteristics in the shape of
slight variations in the lengths of dots and dashes
and spacing between letters and words. Slight as
they are, when a Morse operator regularly “ w o r k s ”
another operator, it becomes quite easy to reco-
gnize the style or “fist”of the other.
In the Second World Wa r, the differences in
the sending styles of secret agents were noted
by their home stations so that if they were cap-
tured false messages emanating from the enemy
could easily be detected.The styles of opera t o r s
on enemy submarines, ships or military units
were also identified to help track their move-
ments on a day-to-day basis. n

T A L K I N G  T O …
You say that the development model 
which has been proposed as a panacea 
for more than half a century is leading nowhere.
Why?
Economic development is one of the
great myths of the 20th century. In the
1 9 7 0 s , people firmly believed Brazil
would conquer poverty and become a
world power. The same thing was said
about India, Mexico and many other
countries. But the fact is that on the eve of
the 21st century, more than 100 countries
have not developed, and only three have
managed to make a breakthrough—South
Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, represen-
ting less than 2 per cent of the population
of the so-called “developing world”.
Development in general, which has
been tried through socialism and is now
being tried through capitalism, has not
happened. For the poor countries, the
choice is no longer about how to develop
but about how to simply survive the chal-
lenges of the technological revolution and
darwinist global competition.
But some world indicators, e.g.for life
expectancy and infant mortality, are improving. .
.
The fact is that in the year 2000 about
1.5 billion people will be living in poverty
on less than a dollar a day and 2.3 billion
on less than two dollars a day, and that in
nearly 100 countries real per capita inco-
me has not increased for 15 years. The
World Bank’s dollar-a-day poverty line
and the UN Development Programme’s
Human Development Index show the
enormous extent of poverty in the inap-
propriately-named developing world.The
existence of vast numbers of people living
in a state of deprivation with such low
purchasing power means that their coun-
tries are “quasi-nations”, unable to carry
out any national project and to be part of
the global economy.
You think many countries are or will 
soon be “non-viable national economies” or,
even worse, “ungovernable chaotic entities”.
Why?
Most of these countries suffer from
what I call “the virus of economic non-
v i a b i l i t y ” — e x p l o s i ve urban populat i o n
growth and production which is focused
on raw materials at a time when the tech-
nological revolution needs less and less of
t h e m . The convergence of these two
trends dramatically hinders development
and creates a structural deadlock which
leads countries so afflicted to “stabilize”
the non-viability of their economies. Not
all non-viable economies collapse.
Countries with the strongest population
growth and the least ability to survive are
OSWALDO DE RIVERO:
D E BUNKING THE MYTHS OF

the ones that break down into “ungover-
nable chaotic entities” (UCEs).
What are these UCEs like?
Basically the government loses control
over large segments of its territory and
population. In such economically non-
viable countries, poor income distribu-
tion, spiralling population growth and
technological backwardness lead to social
exclusion, which in turn stirs up ethnic,
ideological and religious animosity. Large
areas of the country fall under the control
of warlords, drug traffickers, ideologically
motivated guerrillas or a mixture of all
three. So chaos grows, civil society vir-
tually disappears and the populat i o n
becomes dependent on the Red Cross or
Doctors without Borders. The country is
in a state of permanent destabilization.
This what I call an “ungovernable chaotic
entity”.
Could you give us some examples?
UCEs are in a constant state of inter-
nal violence, where fighting altern at e s

B u ru n d i , B o s n i a , C h e c h nya , H a i t i ,
Albania and Colombia.
Does this only happen in the countries of the
South?
There are policies which create exclu-
sion in some rich countries of the North.
In several U.S. cities, there are neighbou-
rhoods which seem as if they’ve been
transplanted from the Third Wo r l d .
There’s also exclusion in France. But
these countries don’t become UCEs
because the state hasn’t lost control of the

country that can be called developed—
because it belongs to the G8 group of

Apart from their economies,
does anything else make countries

cultural problem. In these countri e s — a n d

(ILO) reckon that if the population of
these nations keeps on growing, about a
billion new jobs will be needed at the
beginning of the next century. How can
jobs be found for so many people with the
new technologies? The technologi c a l
revolution and the urban explosion are
therefore on a collision course.
But these two phenomena are virtually
inevitable. So what can be done?
I don’t think there’s an easy remedy
and that’s what shocks people about my
book. You’re not going to get a solution
while the urban population keeps growing
in the world’s developing countries. In the
meantime, there’ll have to be social welfa-
re subsidies and programmes to fight
poverty and create jobs. This isn’t going
to solve the problem, but at least it will
limit the damage.
Will this situation last forever?
It doesn’t matter if it lasts 100 years.
Things will only change when the world’s
birthrate falls, which is expected to hap-
pen sometime around 2050, but until
then there’ll be tremendous social and
political upheavals in the world. Human
beings only learn through experiencing
disaster, not through reason or theories.
People feel compassion about T h i r d
World poverty, but they don’t realize the
damage that’s being done. When serious
disturbances break out,not just ecological
ones but political and social disturbances
which also affect rich countri e s , t h e n
maybe we’ll start thinking about a new
system of co-operation.
You say that if globalization closes the gap
between rich and poor countries, the result will
be ecological disaster. So is there any way out at
all?
The model of consumption in ri c h
c o u n t ries isn’t viable for them either in the
long term .Yet they’re trying to pass on the
p at t e rn of consumption of about a billion
people to almost five billion inhabitants of

u n d e r d e veloped countri e s. The irony is
t h at unemploy m e n t ,p ove rty and exclusion
p r e vent such pat t e rns from being adopted.
If they were adopted, five billion credit
cards would soon destroy the planet’s bios-
p h e r e .There wo n ’t be any solution until all
humanity reduces its level of consumption
and income is better shared out by a sys-
tem of intern ational co-operat i o n .
In your view, the structural adjustment
programmes of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund have not worked.
Has the cure been worse than the disease?
In the long term, yes. In the short
term, they’ve managed to stabilize the
macro-economy and curb inflation. But
they’ve failed in the long term because
they haven’t laid the foundations for capi-
talist development in those countri e s.
They adjusted production but didn’t
modernize it. The neo-liberal develop-
ment theory says once countries have
liberalized their economies, they must
produce goods on the basis of the compa-
rative advantages they enjoy on the world
market. But the only comparative advan-
tage these countries have is their raw
materials. The world economy is deman-
ding more and more goods and services
with high technological content, but the
u n d e r d e veloped economies are still
exporting relatively untransformed raw
materials and products with low techno-
logical input.
Why has this failure been so resounding in
Africa?
African economies have specialized in
exporting bananas, cocoa, minerals and
tropical products which,together with the
population explosion, is a deadly trap.
The continent is the best example of what
I call the conjunction of two “viruses of
n o n - d e velopment”—the population explo-
s i o n and the production of raw materials.
IMF and World Bank officials are obses-
sed with the complete deregulation of the
e c o n o my, when the real problem of
u n d e r d e veloped countries is histori c a l
and cultural: their lack of a capitalist spi-
rit and a scientific tradition to modernize
their production.
Do you see any chance of African countries
being able to reverse this trend?
For the moment, no, none at all.
You regard development aid as a kind of
“Mother Teresa policy”.What do you propose in
its place?
International aid is, paradoxically, the
most striking indication of non-develop-
ment. It won’t solve the problem. But at
least we have to set up systems of interna-
tional co-operation and not treat coun-
tries as equals when they’re not. Ghana,
for example, c a n ’t compete with the
United States in the global market.
Special rules must be set up for develo-
ping countries. Such rules used to exist,
but they’ve all been dismantled.
You propose setting up a transnational
ecological system.What would it be like?
Ecological problems will sooner or
later put a brake on the expansion of
high-consumption capitalism which is
using nature as a raw material and slowly
eating it up. The United Nations isn’t
tackling the problem very well because it
can’t do so without the help of the trans-
national companies, for it is they who are
doing the producing and developing both
AN UNDIPLOMATIC DIPLOMAT
“We must dare to think the unthinkable,” says Oswaldo de Rivero in his book El Mito del Desarrollo
( “ The Myth of Development”),1 which has had a big impact in Latin America and will soon be publi-
shed in English.He argues that development does not exist,or at least not as we have understood it for
the past half-century.
De Rivero is a former Peruvian diplomat who was born in Lima in 1936.He is neither a university pro-
fessor nor a government spoke s m a n . His opinions are based on a profound knowledge of the international
scene acquired during more than 20 years’ experience in a broad range of international forums.
He has represented his country at the United Nations General Assembly and on the Security Council;
he is a former ambassador to the United Kingdom and Russia,president of the Economic Commission of
the Non-Aligned Countries’ summit,president of the Group of 77 countries and chairman of the council
of the Latin American Economic System (SELA), a regional intergovernmental body set up to encourage co-
operation and integration among Latin American and Caribbean countries. He has also been president of
the World Conference on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and the United Nations Disarmament Conference and
led the Peruvian delegation during the Uruguay Round of GATT world trade negotiations.
A lawyer with a degree from the Catholic University of Lima, de Rivero abandoned his diplomatic career
because of “a profound disagreement with the present Peruvian government”. Today he lives in Geneva,
where he works as a United Nations consultant, contributes to the Peruvian daily newspaper La República,
and is currently writing a new book. n

dirty technologies and green technolo-
gies.These firms must be represented in a
t ri p a rtite intern ational body in which
g ove rn m e n t s , t r a n s n ationals and civil
society are represented. A solution can
only be based on negotiations between
the real players.
How powerful are the transnationals?
The rationale of globalization has
s p awned a new faceless non-gove rn m e n t a l
economic ari s t o c r a cy—the transnat i o n a l s.
These day s , the future of many economies
and national cultures is not decided in
g ove rnment ministries or parliaments bu t
on the intern ational financial markets.
Only 10 industrialized countries export
more than the wo r l d ’s 10 richest compa-
n i e s.Yet the World Trade Organization dis-
cusses intern ational trade problems
without these companies. At the Rio Eart h
S u m m i t , countless plans and measures to
protect the environment were put forwa r d ,
none of which have come to fru i t i o n
because the companies responsible for the
e nvironmental damage made no commit-
ment to them. The trouble is that the
t r a n s n ationals have more and more powe r
but no global responsibility.
How can we get them to assume these
responsibilities?
It’s clear that international institutions
no longer reflect the new world power
structure. We can’t go on having diploma-
tic get-togethers between representatives
of governments without any real power to
alter global economic and ecologi c a l
trends. Let’s start by giving the transna-
tionals a place and a vote in international
b o d i e s , because nothing can be done
without them.
This doesn’t guarantee they’ll change their
attitude.
It won’t be easy to change their poli-
cies since the transnationals are ve ry
shrewd and choosy about how and where
they invest.What might change their atti-
tude is the fact that if globalization conti-
nues to create exclusion, they’ll have to
start investing in poor countries to create
markets there. But they’ve already got an
enormous potential market anyway. The
opening up of the Chinese economy
b rings the transnationals 300 million
c o n s u m e rs , the equivalent of the
American market. India brings in another
150 million people with real purchasing
power. So there are still new markets to
be won. . . . And so the process will be a
long one.
So what can the worst-off countries be offered?
Many countries which only produce
raw materials and have a rapidly-growing
urban population are having to wrestle
with shortages of water, energy and food.
To cope with these problems, what I call
a “ n ational surv i val pact” is needed,
because without water, food and energy
there can be no state or civilized life and
no society that can develop. This is the
s i t u ation in countries like Guat e m a l a ,
Peru and Bolivia in Latin America, and
Bangladesh, India and even China, in
Asia.
What does this “survival pact”involve?
A minimum level of development is
impossible without energy, water and
food. How can you educate a child who
A MYTH
IN FIGURES 
“Some truths are unpleasant, but they’re still
t r u t h s,” says Oswaldo de Rivero. Here are some of
them,extracted from his book.
World poverty. In the year 2020,there will be 3
billion poor people in the developing countries, o f
whom more than 800 million will be hungry and
hundreds of millions will be unemployed or under-
employed.
Transnational companies. About 38,000 trans-
national firms and their subsidiaries account for
two-thirds of world tra d e. The sales of the 86
most powerful transnationals exceed the value of
the exports of almost every country in the world.
Financial marke t s. The international financial
market is a huge casino which handles a trillion
dollars’ worth of transactions every day—nearly
six times more than total direct foreign investment
world-wide in one year.
I n e q u a l i t i e s.The annual income of the world’s 358
richest people is greater than the total income of
2.3 billion other people—that is, 45% of the
world’s population.
Food. Almost 800 million people in sub-Saharan
A f r i c a , South A s i a ,C e n t ral America and the A n d e a n
countries have no food security.
Wa t e r. Half the population of the developing
countries do not have enough wa t e r. I l l n e s s e s
related to water pollution kill 25,000 people every
day.
Energy. Low per capita consumption of oil fuel
plus population growth make a country econo-
mically non-viable. High per capita oil consump-
tion in every country would make the civilization
non-viable.
Africa. A total of 162 structural adjustment pro-
g rammes have been implemented in Africa (com-
pared with 126 in the rest of the world) since
1 9 8 2 , reinforcing A f r i c a ’s role as an exporter of ra w
materials and basic products.After 20 years of this
r e g i m e, Africa starts the next millennium with
national economies which are severely handi-
capped in the world economic system.
Raw materials. At the end of the century, t h e
amount of raw material per unit of industrial pro-
duction is two-fifths less than in 1930. Japan has
reduced its consumption of raw materials by 40%
compared with 1973. World demand for high
tech products is growing by 15% every year, w h i l e
the demand for raw materials is growing by less
than 3%. In real terms, prices of raw materials will
continue to fall at least until the middle of the next
century. n

hasn’t been properly fed, how can you
industrialize a city without water,how can
public utilities work without electricity? A
national survival pact involves seeking
secure supplies of energy, water and food
because without them no development
plan can work. But these days there are
no development plans, there’s only the
market. It is thought, absurdly, that the
market will produce development. But
that has never happened. All the develo-
ped countries emerged thanks to protec-
tionist trade policies. It’s impossible for a
country to switch from exporting cotton
to producing computer chips as a result of
the invisible hand of the market. Such a
country will need to have an industrializa-
tion policy and take protectionist mea-
sures, at least temporarily, in order to
develop.
Is there anything constructive about
globalization?
The globalization of communications
is good for the cultural exchanges and
contacts it makes possible and because it
fosters a global awareness of human pro-
blems and suffering. It’s also positive at a
political level—here I’m thinking
particularly of how these days we keep
track of governments that violate human
rights.
But in economic matters, globaliza-
tion imposes a monolithic doctrine. It
sells us a development model that is non-
viable. Instead of creating a “global villa-
ge”, it creates a worldwide collection of
gated communities of wealthy, elegant
people who share the same lifestyle and
pattern of consumption, and destroy the
environment. Behind these ghettos, there
are shanty-tow n s , slums and subu r b s
where water, energy and food are scarce,
and crime, unemployment, violence and
pollution are rife.
Why do you think your book made such an
impact in Latin America?
I think it was successful because a new
awareness is emerging. A large part of
Latin America’s political class has suppor-
ted the single neo-liberal development
model, but people are starting to have
doubts about it.The book came out just
after the big economic crises in Asia,
Russia and Brazil. If it had come out
before,I would have been called pessimis-
tic or crazy.When I had finished the book,
people asked me how I was going to
publish it when Buenos Aires is full of
Mercedes cars and there are dozens of
shopping centres in Santiago de Chile
and Lima. But all that’s just a façade. Of
course, if you go to Caracas,Buenos Aires
or Rio and stay in the hotel where World
Bank officials stay, you’ll get the false
impression everything’s fine. But if you
venture just a short distance away, you’ll
see there are really two countries in one.
So do we have to give up the idea of
development because it’s a kind of suspect
ideology?
I’m not against the market economy
and I don’t say that capitalist deve l o p m e n t
s houldn’t exist.But the laws of the market
“In the 1970s, people firmly believed Brazil would conquer poverty.“ Above, Brazilian miners carrying bags weighing up to 60 kilos.
It is thought, a b s u r d l y, that the market will produce development.
But that has never happened.

fear? A society can neither live like this
nor go forward. Sooner or later, that
youth of 20 will have to get down to the
business of changing the world’s only sys-
tem of development because it works
against him.
And to a young person in an industrialized
country, what would you say?
The consumer society inoculat e s
people against compassion. I’d tell those
young people to get “ d i s - i n o c u l at e d ”
because the way the world’s going, their
children and grandchildren are going to
s u f f e r. A predat o ry attitude has been
encouraged in human beings, that the
strongest win, consume and then forget. I
think lots of young people are aware of
this problem. But most of them live a life
of instant gratification in a sort of moral
vacuum and don’t see any connection
between their own well-being and people
dying in Africa.
Isn’t your attitude over-pessimistic?
I think we have to see things straight.
That’s why I talked about a national
survival pact. Development technocrats
have come up with highly complex plans,
from education to steel production, but
the basics have been forgotten: popula-
tion growth, lack of food, energy and
water. Big countries with nuclear wea-
pons,like India, Pakistan and China,have
serious water supply problems and have
to import food and energy. They’re giants
with feet of clay.That isn’t development. I
am sending out an alarm signal to alert
the poor countries against being hypnoti-
zed by a mirage—the mirage of the tech-
nological development that exists in the
United States and Europe and is virtually
impossible for them to achieve. These
countries must take survival measures,
because otherwise there will be no stable
societies. You can’t have health without
water, production without energy, or life
without food. My book is an appeal for
the poor countries to concentrate on
these essentials. This is what must be
done and done properly. n

are not natural laws. The market can be
regulated and geared to making people
happy. We can’t use it like the law of gra-
vity and say that those who stumble
should fall, that those who aren’t compe-
titive should die. That’s economic darwi-
nism. What’s missing really is a moral
revolution. The problem is ethical, pro-
foundly ethical and cultural. We’ve had a
technological revolution, but we haven’t
had an ethical revolution.
What would you say to a 20-year-old living in a
developing country?
It depends on which social class they
belong to. If they’re from a rich family,
they’ll have no problems, except the risk
of being kidnapped. If they’re middle
class, they’ll have to be realistic and stop
thinking that when they graduate from
university they’re going to find a job, start
a family and live well. I wouldn’t dare to
say anything to a poor person, because in
underdeveloped countries the poor live in
hell, the middle class in purgatory and a
group surrounded by bodyguards lives in
the paradise of global consumption. But
