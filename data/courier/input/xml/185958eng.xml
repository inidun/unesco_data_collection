INDIA: 
People in many 
parts of the world are 
receiving letters this month 
postmarked with a unique tribute. 
The Indian Government commemorated 
the first anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s 
death on 30 January by stamping every letter  
mailed that day with a quotation  
from the great leader’s favourite prayer.
The postmark, much more than a mere stamp collector’s item  
in today’s world, says:  
“May God grant good sense to everyone.”

The UNESCO Gift Coupons Programme has made this discussion group at the Bombay City Social Education Centre possible.
India is a young nation, but it has inherited prodigious, eco-
nomic and educational problems which affect nearly 350 mil-
lion people. Our illiteracy figure is as high as 85%. Though 
70% of our people work on agriculture, we are short of food 
grain. Our standard of living is low. These are a few illustra-
tions. Our leaders are aiming at building up a welfare state, 
at improving agriculture, at industrializing the country. We 
have undertaken schemes for large-scale irrigation, scien-
tific research, and are building up technical institutions to 
train scientific and technical personnel. And so we look to 
UNESCO for all the assistance it may render us in transfor- 
ming ourselves. 
India has been a foundation member of UNESCO, whose 
objectives have always appealed to the Indian mind and con-
science. The delegations to UNESCO included some of our 
foremost scientists and scholars. We have set up a National 
Commission to cooperate with UNESCO and carry out its 
principles in our country. Above all, India believes in the heal-
ing power of the principles of UNESCO. We live in an age 
which is torn by conflict, fear and hatred. If we look below the 
surface of political events we become aware of the massive 
emotional currents which are working to produce a new life 
in society. At the heart of the nature of things, there is always 
a dream. The greatest gift of life is the dream of a higher way 
of living. At the heart of the universe there is this dream of 
justice for all men.  When the framework of society becomes 
a cramped prison, it explodes by the explosive power latent 
in society. This is revolution. And every revolution causes suf-
fering to innocent people, who have to pay for the atrocities 
and arrogance, laziness and selfishness of the forerunners 
or leaders. This does not, however, justify embracing social 
systems that cramp the free spirit of the individual. Democ-
racy is a balance between the organizing power of the state 
and the enterprise of the individual.  Enterprise, adventure 
is what saves civilization from staleness, from boredom. A 
civilization that is adventurous is free, vigorous, and creative. 
Where adventure is lacking, we have life without depth; litera-
ture without spirit, science concerned with the elaboration of 
details, art busy with trivialities.  The spirit of man craves for 
freedom, for co-operation. We must choose between wisdom 
or folly, co-operation or extinction. No nation has a monopoly 
of either wisdom or folly. UNESCO attempts to work for a 
just and enduring peace, for constructive adjustment or con-
flicting interests. Humanity’s inability, nay refusal, to use the 
UNESCO method and deal with world problems in a civilized 
way is the most distressing feature of our time. India believes 
in UNESCO, in the paths of peace and co-operation.  We 
are using all the instruments, the visual arts, theatre, dance, 
music, cinema, wireless etc., for this one supreme purpose of 
fostering the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.

UNESCO’s Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi 
NESCO is paying a special tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. It renders hom-
age to both the person and the writings of a man whose spiritual influence has 
extended throughout the world in a new book entitled All Men Are Brothers, which 
presents the life and thoughts of the great teacher as set down in Gandhi’s own 
words. The aim of the texts is to illustrate and make better known the different 
aspects of Gandhi’s personality and writings. The English edition will be followed 
by French and Spanish versions. On pages 10, 11 and 12 we publish a section of 
Gandhi’s thoughts taken from All Men Are Brothers. The complete introduction 
to the UNESCO volume specially written by Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, is 
presented on the opposite page.

The UNESCO Courier - Special Issue November 2009 l 9
A 
great teacher appears once in 
a while. Several centuries may 
pass by without the advent of 
such a figure. He is known by 
his life. He first lives and then 
tells others how they may live like him. 
Gandhi is such a teacher. These selec-
tions from his speeches and writings 
compiled with great care and discrimi-
nation by Sri Krishna Kripalani will give 
the reader some idea of the workings of 
Gandhi’s mind, its development and the 
practices he adopted. 
Gandhi’s life was rooted in India’s 
religious tradition, with its emphasis on 
a passionate search for the truth, a pro-
found reverence for life, the ideal of non-
attachment and the readiness to sacrifice 
all for the knowledge of God. He lived his 
whole life in the perpetual quest of truth: 
“I live and move and have my being in the 
pursuit of this goal.” 
A life which has no roots, which is lack-
ing in depth of background is a super-
ficial one. There are some who assume 
that when we see what is right, we will 
do it. Even when we know what is right, it 
does not follow that we will choose and 
do right. We are overcome by powerful 
impulses, we do wrong and betray the 
light in us. “In our present state we are, 
according to the Hindu doctrine, only 
partly human; the lower part of us is still 
animal; only the conquest of our lower 
instincts by love can slay the animal in 
us.” It is by a process of trial and error, 
self-research and austere discipline that 
the human being moves, step by painful 
step, along the road to fulfilment.
G
andhi’s religion was a rational 
and ethical one. He would not 
accept any belief that did not 
appeal to his reason, or any in-
junction which his conscience 
did not commend. If we believe in God, 
not merely with our intellect but with our 
whole being, we will love all mankind 
without any distinction of race or class, 
nation or religion. We will work for the uni-
ty of mankind. “All my actions have their 
rise in my inalienable love of mankind.” 
“I have known no distinction between 
relatives and strangers, countrymen 
and foreigners, white and coloured, Hin-
dus and Indians of other faiths whether 
Musulmans, Parsees, Christians or Jews. 
I may say that my heart has been in-
capable of making any such distinc-
tions.” “By a long process of prayerful 
discipline I have ceased for over forty 
years to hate anybody.” All men are 
brothers and no human being should 
be a stranger to another. The welfare 
of all, ‘sarvodaya’, should be our aim. 
God is the common bond that unites 
all human beings. To break this bond 
even with our greatest enemy is to 
tear God himself to pieces. There is 
humanity even in the most wicked. 
This view leads naturally to the adop-
tion of non-violence as the best means 
for solving all problems, national and 
international. Gandhi affirmed that he 
was not a visionary but a practical ide-
alist. Non-violence is meant not merely 
for saints and sages but for the com-
mon people also. “Non-violence is the 
law of our species, as violence is the 
law of the brute. The spirit lies dor-
mant in the brute and he knows no law 
but that of physical might. The dignity 
of man requires obedience to a higher 
law – to the strengths of the spirit.”
Gandhi was the first in human 
history to extend the principle 
of non-violence from the indi-
vidual to the social and politi-
cal plane. He entered politics 
for the purpose of experimenting with 
non-violence and establishing its validity. 
“Some friends have told me that truth and 
non-violence have no place in politics and 
worldly affairs. I do not agree. I have no 
use for them as a means of individual sal-
vation. Their introduction and application 
in everyday life has been my experiment all 
along.” “For me, politics bereft of religion 
are absolute dirt, ever to be shunned. Poli-
tics concerns nations and that which con-
cerns the welfare of nations must be one 
of the concerns of a man who is religiously 
inclined, in other words, a seeker after 
God and Truth. For me God and Truth 
are convertible terms, and if any one told 
me that God was a God of untruth or a 
God of torture I would decline to worship 
him. Therefore, in politics also we have to 
establish the Kingdom of Heaven.” 
In the struggle of India’s independence, 
he insisted that we should adopt civilized 
methods of non-violence and suffering. 
His stand for the freedom of India was not 
based on any hatred for Britain. We must 
hate the sin not the sinner. “For me patrio-
tism is the same as humanity. I am patri-
otic because I am human and humane. I 
will not hurt England or Germany to serve 
India.” He believed that he rendered a ser-
vice to the British in helping them to do 
the right thing by India. The result was not 
only the liberation of the Indian people 
but an increase in the moral resources of 
mankind. 
In the present nuclear context, if we wish 
to save the world, we should adopt the 
principles of non-violence. Gandhi said: 
“I did not move a muscle, when I first 
heard that an atom bomb had wiped 
out Hiroshima. On the contrary I said 
to myself: unless now the world adopts 
non-violence, it will spell certain suicide 
for mankind.” In any future conflict we 
cannot be certain that neither side will 
deliberately use nuclear weapons. We 
have the power to destroy in one blind-
ing flash all that we have carefully built 
up across the centuries by our endeav-
our and sacrifice. By a campaign of pro-
paganda we condition men’s minds for 
nuclear warfare. Provocative remarks fly 
about freely. We use aggression even in 
words; harsh judgements, ill-will, anger, 
are all insidious forms of violence. 
In the present predicament when we 
are not able to adjust ourselves to the 
new conditions which science has 
brought about, it is not easy to adopt 
the principles of non-violence, truth and 
understanding. But on that ground we 
should not give up the effort. While the 
obstinacy of the political leaders puts 
fear into our hearts, the common sense 
and conscience of the peoples of the 
world give us hope. 
With the increased velocity of mod-
ern changes we do not know what the 
world will be a hundred years hence. 
We cannot anticipate the future currents 
of thought and feeling. But years may 
go their way, yet the great principles of 
satya and ahimsa, truth and non-violence, 
are there to guide us. They are the silent 
stars keeping holy vigil above a tired and 
turbulent world. Like Gandhi we may be 
firm in our conviction that the sun shines 
above the drifting clouds.
W
e live in an age which is 
aware of its own defeat 
and moral coarsening, an 
age in which old certain-
ties are breaking down, 
the familiar patterns are tilting and cracking. 
There is increasing intolerance and embit-
terment. The creative flame that kindled the 
great human society is languishing. The 
human mind in all its baffling strangeness 
and variety produces contrary types, a 
Buddha or a Gandhi, a Nero or a Hitler. It is 
our pride that one of the greatest figures of 
history lived in our generation, walked with 
us, spoke to us, taught us the way of civi-
lized living. He who wrongs no one fears 
no one. He has nothing to hide and so is 
fearless. He looks everyone in the face. 
His step is firm, his body upright, and his 
words are direct and straight. Plato said 
long ago: “There always are in the world a 
few inspired men whose acquaintance is 
beyond price.”

“I have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and non-violence 
are as old as the hills.”
“It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel them-
selves honoured by the humiliation of their fellow-beings.”
 
“Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which, though 
easy enough to understand, is rarely practised, and that is why 
the poison of hatred spreads in the world.”
 
“You have to stand against the whole world although you may 
have to stand alone. You have to stare the world in the face al-
though the world may look at you with bloodshot eyes. Do not 
fear. Trust that little thing in you which resides in the heart and 
says: Forsake friends, wife, all; but testify to that for which you 
have lived and for which you have to die.”
“God has created different faiths just as He has the votaries 
thereof. How can I even secretly harbour the thought that my 
neighbour’s faith is inferior to mine and wish that he should give 
up his faith and embrace mine? As a true and loyal friend, I can 
only wish and pray that he may live and grow perfect in his own 
faith. In God’s house there are many mansions and they are 
equally holy. Let no one even for a moment entertain the fear that 
a reverent study of other religions is likely to weaken or shake 
one’s faith in one’s own. The Hindu system of philosophy regards 
all religions as containing the elements of truth in them and en-
joins an attitude of respect and reverence towards them all. This 
of course presupposes regard for one’s own religion. Study and 
 “The World is sick of hatred”  
 Mahatma Gandhi
appreciation of other religions need not cause a weakening of 
that regard; it should mean extension of that regard to other re-
ligions.”
“Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. 
It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by 
the ingenuity of man. Destruction is not the law of the humans. 
Man lives freely by his readiness to die, if need be, at the hands 
of his brother, never by killing him. Every murder or other injury, 
no matter for what cause, committed or inflicted on another is a 
crime against humanity.”
“My experience, daily growing stronger and richer, tells me that 
there is no peace for individuals or for nations without practising 
Truth and Non-violence to the uttermost extent possible for man. 
The policy of retaliation has never succeeded.”
“My love for non-violence is superior to every other thing mun-
dane or supramundane. It is equalled only by my love for truth 
which is to me synonymous with non-violence through which and 
which alone I can see and reach Truth. My scheme of life, if it 
draws no distinction between different religionists in India, also 
draws none between different races. For me A man’s a man for 
all that.”
“My non-violence does not admit of running away from danger 
and leaving dear ones unprotected. Between violence and cow-
ardly flight, I can only prefer violence to cowardice. I can no more 
preach non-violence to a coward that I can tempt a blind man 
to enjoy healthy scenes. Non-violence is the summit of bravery. 
And in my own experience, I have had no difficulty in demonstrat-
ing to men trained in the school of violence the superiority of 
non-violence. As a coward, which I was for years, I harboured 
violence. I began to prize non-violence only when I began to shed 
cowardice.” 
“Not knowing the stuff of which non-violence is made, many 
have honestly believed that running away from danger every time 
was a virtue compared to offering resistance, especially when 
it was fraught with danger to one’s life. As a teacher of non- 
violence, I must, so far as it is possible for me, guard against such 
an unmanly belief.” 
“I am not a visionary. I claim to be a practical idealist. Religion 
of non-violence is not meant merely for the rishis and saints. It is 
meant for the common people as well. Non-violence is the law 
of our species as violence is the law of the brute. The spirit lies 
dormant in the brute, and he knows no law but that of physical 
might. The dignity of man requires obedience to a higher law, to 
the strength of the spirit.” 
“Often does good come out of evil. But that is God’s, not man’s 
plan. Man knows that only evil can come out of evil, as good out 
of good… The moral to be legitimately drawn from the supreme 
tragedy of the atom bomb is that it will not be destroyed by coun-
ter bombs, even as violence cannot be by counter violence. Man-
kind has to go out of violence only through non-violence. Hatred 
can be overcome only by love. Counter hatred only increases the 
surface, as well as the depth of hatred.” 
“It is impossible for one to be an internationalist without being 
a nationalist. Internationalism is possible only when nationalism 
becomes a fact, i.e., when peoples belonging to different coun-
tries have organized themselves and are able to act as one man.

It is not nationalism that is evil, it is the narrowness, selfishness, 
exclusiveness which is the bane of modern nations which is evil. 
Each wants to profit at the expense of, and rise on the ruin of, 
the other.”
“Interdependence is and ought to be as much the ideal of man 
as self-sufficiency. Man is a social being. Without inter-relation 
with society he cannot realize his oneness with the universe or 
suppress his egoism. His social interdependence enables him to 
test his faith and to prove himself on the touchstone of reality. If 
man were so placed or could so place himself as to be absolutely 
above all dependence on his fellow-beings he would become 
so proud and arrogant as to be a veritable burden and nuisance 
to the world. Dependence on society teaches him the lesson of 
humanity.”  
“What is the cause of the present chaos? It is exploitation, I will 
not say of weaker nations by the stronger, but of sister nations by 
sister nations. And my fundamental objection to machinery rests 
on the fact that it is machinery that has enabled these nations to 
exploit others.” 
“My notion of democracy is that under it the weakest should 
have the same opportunity as the strongest. That can never hap-
pen except through non-violence.”
“The true source of rights is duty. If we all discharge our duties, 
rights will not be far to seek. If leaving duties unperformed we run 
after rights, they will escape us like a will-o’-the-wisp. The more 
we pursue them, the farther will they fly.” 
“To me political power is not an end but one of the means of en-
abling people to better their conditions in every department of life. 
Political power means capacity to regulate national life through 
national representatives. If national life becomes so perfect as to 
become self-regulated, no representation becomes necessary. 
There is then a state of enlightened anarchy. In such a state every 
one is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is 
never a hindrance to his neighbour. In the ideal State, therefore, 
there is no political power because there is no State. But the 
ideal is never fully realized in life. Hence the classic statement of 
Thoreau that government is best which governs the least.”  
“I value individual freedom but you must not forget that man is 
essentially a social being. He has risen to his present status by 
learning to adjust his individualism to the requirements of social 
progress. Unrestricted individualism is the law of the beast of the 
jungle. We have learnt to strike the mean between individual free-
dom and social restraint. Willing submission to social restraint for 
the sake of the well-being of the whole society enriches both the 
individual and the society of which one is a member.” 
“The golden rule of conduct is mutual toleration, seeing that we 
will never all think alike and we shall see Truth in fragment and 
from different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing 
for all. Whilst, therefore, it is a good guide for individual conduct, 
imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interfer-
ence with everybody’s freedom of conscience.”
 
“Differences of opinion should never mean hostility. If they did, 
my wife and I should be sworn enemies of one another. I do not 
know two persons in the world who had no difference of opinion, 
and as I am a follower of the Gita, I have always attempted to 
regard those who differ from me with the same affection as I 
have for my nearest and dearest.”

“We must be content to die, if we cannot live as free men 
and women.” 
“Even the most despotic government cannot stand except 
for the consent of the governed, which consent is often forc-
ibly procured by the despot. Immediately the subject ceases to 
fear the despotic force, his power is gone.” 
“The true democrat is he who, with purely non-violent means, 
defends his liberty and, therefore, his country’s and ultimately that 
of the whole of mankind.”  
“I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my 
windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all lands to be blown 
about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off 
my feet by any. I would have our young men and women with liter-
ary tastes to learn as much of English and other world-languages 
as they like, and then expect them to give the benefits of their 
learning to India and to the world.” 
“I am not sure that it is not better for the children to have much 
of the preliminary instruction imparted to them vocally. To impose 
on children of tender age a knowledge of the alphabet and the 
ability to read before they can gain general knowledge is to 
deprive them, whilst they are fresh, of the power of assimilating 
instruction by word of mouth.” 
“I would develop in the child his hands, his brain and his soul. 
The hands have almost atrophied. The soul has been altogether 
ignored.” 
“A wise parent allows the children to make mistakes. It is good 
for them once in a while to burn their fingers.” 
“To call woman the weaker sex is a libel; it is man’s injustice 
to woman. If by strength is meant brute strength then indeed, is 
woman less brute than man. If by strength is meant moral power, 
then woman is immeasurably man’s superior. Has she not greater 
intuition, is she not more self-sacrificing, has she not greater pow-
ers of endurance, has she not greater courage? Without her man 
could not be. If non-violence is the law of our being, the future 
is with woman… Who can make a more effective appeal to the 
heart than woman?”
“I believe in the proper education of women. But I do believe that 
women will not make her contribution to the world by mimicking 
or running a race with men. She can run the race, but she will not 
rise to the great heights she is capable of by mimicking man. She 
has to be the complement of man.”
 
“I am not at all concerned with appearing to be consistent. In 
my pursuit after Truth I have discarded many ideas and learnt many 
new things. Old as I am in age, I have no feeling that I have ceased 
to grow inwardly or that my growth will stop with the dissolution 
of the flesh. What I am concerned with is my readiness to obey 
the call of Truth, my God, from moment to moment. Music means 
rhythm, order. Its effect is electrical. It immediately soothes. Unfor-
tunately like our shastras, music has been the prerogative of the 
few. It has never been nationalized in the modern sense. If I had any 
influence with volunteer boy scouts and Seva Samiti organizations, 
I would make compulsory a proper singing in company of national 
songs. And to that end I should have great musicians attending 
every congress or conference and teaching mass music.” 
“I love music and all the other arts, but I do not attach such value 
to them as is generally done. I cannot, for example, recognize the 
value of those activities which require technical knowledge for 
their understanding… When I gaze at the starsown heaven, and 
the infinite beauty it affords my eyes, that means to me more than 
all human art can give. That does not mean that I ignore the value 
of those works generally called artistic; but personally, in com-
parison with the infinite beauty of Nature, I feel their unreality too 
intensely… Life is greater than all art. I would even go further and 
declare that the man whose life comes nearest to perfection 
is the greatest artist; for what is art without the sure founda-
tion and framework of a noble life?”

Portrait of a Man
                                       by Satyajit Ray
n August 7, 1941, in the city of Calcutta, a man died. His mor-
tal remains perished, but he left behind him a heritage which 
no fire could consume.  
It was a heritage of words and music and poetry, of ideas 
and ideals, and it has the power to move us today and in the 
days to come.   
We, who owe him so much, salute his memory.  
Founded in the year 1690 by an Englishman named Job 
Charnock, the city of Calcutta, one hundred years ago, was 
a thriving metropolis. As the capital of India Calcutta was the 
seat of government.  
In the northern part of this sprawling city, in the area known 
as Jorasanko in Chitpore, was the family residence of the Tag-
ores. The Tagores had an impressive lineage. It dated back 
to the first group of learned Brahmins that came from Kanauj 
and settled in Bengal in the 8th century. One thousand years 
later, Panchanan, a descendant, came to the new city of Cal-
cutta and found a lucrative position with a British shipping 
company. His grandson Nilmoni added considerably to the 
family fortune and built the house at Jorasanko in 1789.  
The peak was reached, however, with Nilmoni’s grandson, 
Dwarkanath, one of the most brilliant and colourful figures of 
the 19th century. Dwarkanath Tagore combined cultured so-
phistication with largeness of heart and a rare degree of busi-
ness acumen. Coal, sugar, indigo, export, banking, newspa-
pers, there was no end to his enterprise – and he succeeded 
in all. If his earnings were fabulous, so was his spending.  
Although a Hindu and a Vaishnab, Dwarkanath defied the 
ban of Brahmin orthodoxy and twice went to England. There 
he had an audience with Queen Victoria, discussions with 
Gladstone, and dinner with men like Dickens, Thackeray and 
Max Muller. 
Before his death in England, Dwarkanath had written a let-
ter to his eldest son Debendranath reproving him for neglect-
ing the family’s business affairs. For some years past, young 
Debendranath had been developing tendencies which might 
well have distressed his father. 
It began in a burning ‘ghat’. The last rites were being admin-
istered to Debendranath’s grandmother. Not far away, on the 
river bank, sat Debendranath. Like many a rich man’s son, he 
had been leading a wayward life. But tonight, he was over-
come by a strange feeling. Worldly possessions seemed to 
lose their meaning for him.  
This led to a period of profound disquiet, followed by a 
ceaseless quest for the meaning of existence in the great 
source books of the East and West. He read the materialist 
philosophers of modern Europe – Locke, Hume, Bentham 
and others – whose ideas were so much in vogue among 
the students of the time. Then he learnt Sanskrit and read 
the Mahabharata. But peace of mind would not come until 
one day he chanced upon a torn page of a Sanskrit book. 
There was a ‘sloka’ in it, which said: “God is supreme and 
all-pervading. Be content with what He gives. Do not covet 
another’s wealth.”  
This happened to be a page of the Ishopanishad, edited by 
Raja Rammohun Roy. Rammohun had been a close friend 
of Dwarkanath’s. As a boy, Debendranath had a deep and 
silent admiration for the man. But the greatness of Raja’s vi-
sion and the magnitude and nobility of the tasks he had set 
before himself, were beyond the boy’s comprehension. The 
Raja lived in times when India’s spiritual heritage was being 
submerged in ritual and superstition. 
Growing up in  
a family of scholars and artists
Rammohun advocated Western education for Indians be-
cause he wanted the new ideas of the West to spread in 
the country. But he also wanted to us to respect what was 
old and true in our own heritage. His own study of the Upa-
nishads had led him to the monotheistic bases of Hinduism, 
which he sought to spread through writings and lecturers. 
His work was left unfinished by his death in England. And 
now Debendranath, inspired by the two lines of Sanskrit 
text, went on to prove to be his true spiritual son and heir. 
Debendranath suffered social ostracism for preaching the 
monotheistic faith that he called Brahmoism, but to his fol-
lowers – and there were many – he was Maharshi, the Great 
Sage.  When Rabindranath was born, the Maharshi was 45 
years old. His wife Saradamoni was 33. Rabindranath was 
Satyajit Ray (1921 - 1992)  
was one of India’s leading film directors.  
In 1961 he made a documentary film on Rabindranath Tagore  
on the occasion of the poet’s birth centennial.

the fourteenth child. The eldest was Dwijendranath – poet, 
philosopher and mathematician. The second son, Satyen-
dranath, was a Sanskrit scholar who translated the Gita and 
Meghdoot into Bengali verse, went to England and returned 
as the first Indian member of the Indian Civil Service. The fifth 
son, Jyotirindranath, was a born musician, translated Molière 
and Sanskrit dramas into Bengali, and wrote and staged 
some of the most popular Bengali plays of his time. Among 
the daughters was Swarnakumari, the first woman novelist 
and the first woman to edit a literary journal in India. Indeed it 
was a household which hummed with activity.  At the age of 
seven, Rabi was sent to school. He went to four schools and 
hated them all. But to say that he lacked education would be 
wrong, for his third brother, Hemendranath, saw to his stud-
ies at home, and it was all done by the clock.  Rabi was 13 
when his first book of verse, ‘Kabikahini’, came out. When 
Rabi was 16, Dwijendranath brought out a literary magazine 
called ‘Bharati’, and Rabi found an admirable platform for his 
literary activities. His essays included pieces on European 
poets like Dante and Petrarch whose acquaintance Rabi had 
already made in the library of his elder brother Satyendranath. 
Satyendranath’s wife, Gnanadanandini, who had been stay-
ing in England with her two children, was a remarkable wom-
an, who had been persuaded by her husband to come out of 
orthodox seclusion. Tabi set out for England in the summer 
of 1879 and joined Gnanadanandini at Brighton. If the plan 
was to provide the boy with a proper education, it came to 
nought. For Rabi returned a year later without completing his 
course of studies at London University. 
While in England, Rabi had become acquainted with West-
ern music. Some of the tunes he had learned found their way 
into the enchanting opera ‘Valmiki-Prativa’. There were other 
tunes, however, which had their origin in classical Indian ra-
gas, used for the first time in an operatic context. 
Watching life  
through the window
‘Valmiki-Prativa’ was performed in the Tagore residence 
with Rabindranath himself in the role of the bandit-turned-
poet. The rest of the cast, too, was composed of members 
of the Tagore family, all gifted with varying degrees of talent. 
Among those who saw and praised this performance was the 
greatest literary figure of the time, Bankim Chandra Chatterji. 
A year later, when Rabindranath’s Sandhya-Sangeet was 
published, Bankim Chandra personally congratulated the 
poet and acknowledged his pre-eminence among the rising 
writers of the day.  At the age of 22, Rabindranath married 
Bhabatarini Devi; the old fashioned name was later changed 
to Mrinalini. Two months before the wedding Rabindranath 
had received a letter from his father in which he was asked to 
prepare himself to look after the family estates. After a period 
of initial training in the Estates’ Offices in Calcutta, Rabin-
dranath found himself in the very heart of rural Bengal, in the 
area of the river Padma.  With a worldly wisdom unusual in a 
poet, but characteristic of the Tagores, Rabindranath in later 
life set out in a practical way to improve the lot of the poor 
peasants of his estates and his varied work in this field is 
on record. But his own gain from this intimate contact with 
the fundamental aspects of life and nature, and the influence 
of this contact on his own life and work are beyond mea-
sure. Living mostly in his boat and watching the life through 
the window, a whole new world of sights and sounds and 
feelings opened up before him. It was a world in which the 
moods of people and the moods of nature were inextricably 
interwoven. The people found room in a succession of great 
short stories, and nature, in an outpouring of exquisite songs 
and poems. Dominant was the mood of the rains, exultant and 
terrible.  In 1901, Rabindranath was 40 years old. His already 
enormous output of poems and plays had been gathered in 
one big volume. It comprised 21 books and included Sonar 
Tari, his first masterpiece.  The same year, 1901, marked an 
event of a somewhat different nature. In 1862, one year after 
Rabindranath was born, the Maharshi had acquired some 
property in Bolpur, in the district of Birbhum in West Ben-
gal. The property was made over to a board of trustees, 
and the deed specified that the place was to be used for 
meditation on the Supreme Formless Being. According 
to the Maharshi’s wishes, a seat of prayer and a temple 
of worship had been built, and close to the temple, a 
residence which was called Santiniketan – the Abode of 
Peace.  Rabindranath had been worrying about the edu-
cation of his children, and he decided to start an experi-
mental educational institution in Santiniketan. It was to 
be a school, but not like the schools that had been the 
nightmare of his own childhood. It was to be like the forest 
hermitages of classical India.  But to bring it into being 
was not an easy task. For one thing, it cost money and 
Rabindranath had to sell, among other things, the copy-
right of his books. His wife added her bit by selling her 
wedding ornaments. Three months after the school was 
opened, she was taken ill. Two months later, she died. For 
Rabindranath it was the beginning of a series of personal 
tragedies. Nine months after his wife’s death, his second 
daughter Renuka passed away. The hardest blow of all 
came four years later. The youngest son Sami, who took 
after his father in many ways, fell a victim to cholera when 
he was only 12.  It was in the midst of these bereave-
ments that Rabindranath participated in one of the great-
est political upheavals in the history of India. In December 
1903 was published the decision of Governor-General 
Lord Curzon to split up Bengal into two provinces. The 
idea was to create a separate province with a Moslem 
majority, which would induce a rift between the two main 
religious groups and thus avert the possible growth of a 
united front against the Government.  But in proposing 
the Partition, Curzon merely fanned the flame of patrio-
tism that had been smouldering in the minds of certain 
visionaries all through the period of the renaissance in 
Bengal. These men now came to the fore and led the mil-
lions to rise in a protest. 
Poetic politics
The series of stirring patriotic songs which Rabindranath 
composed for the occasion were sung in processions in 
the streets of Calcutta with the poet himself in the lead. 
On 27 October, 1905, the Partition became an accom-
plished fact. In a form of protest that only a poet could 
conceive, Rabindranath turned the Black Day into a mass 
festival of Rakhibandhan – the tying of the band of friend-
ship.  But the Swadeshi movement was fated to grow 
and assume a character which was not possible to fore-
see in its early stages. While admitting the bravery and 
patriotism of those who killed or were killed in a reck-
less bid for freedom, Rabindranath could not condone 
terrorism. He stated his credo in clear terms. The path 
of violence was not for India. Good could come only out 
of constructive work carried out in a spirit of tolerance. 
He had himself followed up his retirement from the po-

litical scene by undertaking the work of rural welfare in 
his estates. And there were other activities: he was teach-
ing at school, editing journals, and engaging himself in 
almost every conceivable form of literary activity.  That his 
own countrymen now regarded him as their leading man 
of letters was proved by his 50th birthday celebrations in 
Calcutta. Sponsored by the Bengal Academy of Letters and 
attended by thousands, it was a unique literary manifesta-
tion in India. But to the outside world, Rabindranath was 
still an unknown name.  The object of Rabindranath’s visit 
to England in 1912 was to study the educational methods 
of the West and also to acquaint the West with his work 
at Santiniketan. He happened to carry with him on this 
occasion a notebook containing his own English trans-
lations of some of his poems, mainly from Gitanjali. He 
showed these translations to the English painter, William 
Rothenstein, who had met the poet on an earlier visit to 
India. Rothenstein was so impressed that he sent a copy 
of the translation to the great Irish poet, William Butler 
Yeats.  Introducing the poems to a gathering of English 
writers and intellectuals, Yeats said: “I know of no man in 
my time who has done anything in the English language 
to equal these lyrics. Even as I read them in these lit-
eral English translations, they are exquisite in style and 
thought.” Gitanjali was published in England in the same 
year. There has rarely been another instance of a poet 
gaining world fame in like manner. The Nobel Prize came 
in 1913 and knighthood in 1915, while war was raging 
in Europe. Touring the United States and Japan in 1916, 
Rabindranath made eloquent appeals for peace. He felt 
that world peace could only be achieved through intellec-
tual co-operation between nations. He said, “The call has 
come to every individual in the present age to prepare 
himself for the dawn of a new era, when man shall dis-
cover his soul in the spiritual unity of all human beings.”
Pursuing this noble idea of international co-operation, 
Rabindranath gave the school at Santiniketan a new sta-
tus and a new name. ‘Yatra Visvam Bharati Ekanirham’

– Where the world makes home in a single nest – this 
was the motto of Visvam Bharati, the World University, 
which was inaugurated in December 1918, with the 
aged philosopher Brijendranath Seal presiding.   
Dominating the Indian political scene at this time was 
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. As a barrister in South 
Africa, Ghandi had fought for the rights of the Indians liv-
ing in that country. As a protest against the Rowlatt Act, 
Gandhi launched a movement of passive resistance. But 
the masses misinterpreted the movement and, following 
a rumour of Gandhi’s arrest, violence broke out in many 
parts of the country. As a result of this the Government 
started taking repressive measures out of all proportion to 
the magnitude of the violence.  
In the Punjab, martial law was declared. In charge of the 
troops at Amritsar was Brigadier General Dyer. On the first 
day of the month of Vaisakh, a crowd gathered in Jallian-
wallabagh, as it had done every other year. It was a peace-
ful crowd. But Dyer was taking no chances. Machine guns 
rattled.  
The news of the Amritsar incident was suppressed by the 
Government, but details of it filtered through to other parts 
of the country and even to the Abode of Peace.  
Rabindranath rushed to Calcutta. But the Defence of India 
Act was still in force and no leaders would support him in a 
plea for a meeting of protest.  
No nation can be proud  
of isolating its life & culture
At four o’clock on the morning of May 30, Rabindranath fin-
ished writing a letter. It was addressed to the Viceroy, Lord 
Chelmsford, and it was published in the newspapers. Con-
demning the Government for the killing at Jallianwallabagh, 
Rabindranath concluded by saying: “And I for my part wish to 
stand, shorn of all special distinctions, by the side of my coun-
trymen who for their so-called insignificance are liable to suffer 
degradation not fit for human beings. And these are the reasons 
which have painfully compelled me to ask your Excellency to re-
lieve me of my title of knighthood.”
The next ten years of Rabindranath’s life were filled with cease-
less activity. The urge to travel, and the necessity to collect funds 
for his university, took him to all parts of the world and the West 
as much as the East, welcomed him with open arms.  
Wherever he went, he spread the message of peace and 
stressed the importance of intellectual co-operation between 
nations. He said: “We ought to know that isolation of life and 
culture is not a thing of which any nation can be proud. In the 
human world, giving is exchanging, it is not one-sided.” 
His great humanist ideas found an echo in the best minds of 
Europe, and some became his close friends.  
In the meantime, the institution at Santiniketan had come 
a long way from its modest beginnings. Its scope for studies 
had greatly increased. There was Kalabhawan for the study of 
painting, under masters like Nandalal Bose, who was himself 
a pupil of Abanindranath, a nephew of the poet. The Sangeet 
Bhawan, which neglected no brand of Indian music, had also 
grown under Dinendranath, another of the poet’s nephews. Spe-
cial provisions had been made for conducting oriental studies, 
and scholars came from abroad and stayed to lecture for study 
and research. Such men were Moriz Winternitz from Austria, 
Sylvain Levi from France, Victor Lesny from Austria, and Sten 
Konow from Norway.  
But there were some Europeans who did even more than 
that. Charles Freer Andrews, a missionary who was present at 
Yeats’ reading at Gitanjali, and William Winstanely Pearson, 
who had also met the poet in England, came to the Ashram in 
its early days – drawn by the poet’s personality – and stayed 
on until their death, working with a selfless devotion to the poet 
and his cause that few Indians could equal. Leonard Elmhirt, 
another Englishman who was drawn by the poet’s personality, 
came over to Santiniketan and took charge of the Santiniketan 
at Surul, two miles away.  
The poet’s last European tour began with a visit to Oxford, 
where he delivered the series of Hibbert lectures which were 
later published as ‘The Religion of Man’.  
It was also on this last tour that Rabindranath went to 
Soviet Russia for the first time. On the eve of his departure 
from Moscow he told his hosts: “You have recognized the truth 
that in extirpating all special evils one has to go to the root, and 
the only way to it is through education.” In Russia as well as 
in other places that he visited on this tour, Rabindranath held 
exhibitions and had found a new outlet for his creative urge.  
In 1931, the leading citizens of Calcutta united in an appeal 
to observe the poet’s 70th birthday. It was celebrated in a 
manner that was truly worthy of the occasion. The Golden 
Book of Tagore was a testimony to the love and reverence 
that the intellectuals of the world bore for the poet. Its spon-
sors consisted of three Europeans and two Indians. There 
was Romain Rolland from France, Albert Einstein from Ger-
many, and the poet Kostes Palamas from Greece. One of the 
two Indians was the scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, the 
other was Mahatma Gandhi.  
The last years of the poet’s life were spent largely in his 
beloved Santiniketan. He had a choice of small houses built 
for him, for he never liked to stay in the same house, or even 
in the same room for long. It was in a way symbolic of the 
refusal to get into a rut which had marked his whole life. In 
his writings he was now producing some of his most mature, 
original and striking works, and these included text books and 
nonsense rhymes for children, not an unusual occupation for 
someone who had loved and understood children all his life 
and had done so much to mould them for a better future. His 
health was failing, but calls of duty, which he was ever ready 
to answer, gave him little rest.  
On May 7, 1941, Rabindranath was 80 years old. Three 
months later, he was to leave the Ashram, never to return. He 
would be taken to his ancestral house in Calcutta, fatally ill.  
Rabindranath attended his 80th birthday celebrations in 
Santiniketan in spite of his failing health. For the occasion, he 
had composed a message – his last message to the world. 
It was called ‘Crisis in Civilization’. It concerned itself with the 
state of the so-called modern civilization, a civilization that 
was being shaken to its very roots by barbaric wars of ag-
gression.  
In the course of the message, Rabindranath said: “I had at 
one time believed that the springs of civilization could issue 
out of the heart of Europe. But today, when I am about to leave 
the world, that faith had deserted me. I look around and see the 
crumbling ruins of a proud civilization strewn like a vast heap 
of futility. And yet, I shall not commit the previous sin of losing 
faith in Man. I shall wait for the day when the holocaust will end 
and the air will be rendered clean with the spirit of service and 
sacrifice. Perhaps that dawn will come from this horizon, from 
the East, where the sun rises. On that day will unvanquished 
man retrench his path of conquest, surmounting all barriers, to 
win back his lost human heritage.”

MAHATMA Gandhi was the foremost leader of the Indian 
independence movement, and one of his great qualities 
was to secure and retain the devotion of persons of differing 
temperaments, but all of very great distinction. Of these, three 
leading figures were Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarvepalli Radhakrish-
nan and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. 
Educated in Britain, Nehru was drawn to Gandhi because 
he felt that, while others talked, Gandhi was primarily a man of 
action who was making a dent in British rule. Nehru accepted 
Gandhi’s method of non-violence, first as a useful weapon 
against the British and then, after the atom bomb of 1945, as a 
means without alternative. He saw the validity of Marx’s analy-
sis of historical change but did not believe that such change 
can only be brought about by force. The class war could not 
be denied, but it could be resolved by persuasion. In the free-
dom movement, Nehru realized that, while Gandhi had brought 
the peasants into the political campaign, to retain their inter-
est and support, the Indian National Congress should have an 
economic programme. In this sense he is a pioneer of modern, 
twentieth-century nationalism. 
Once Gandhi had brought other classes into the indepen-
dence movement, it became Nehru’s task to hold the various 
classes together by taking account of the basic economic 
needs of the vast majority of the Indian people. So Nehru 
promised that, when freedom had been won, the free govern-
ment of India would give priority to economic development and 
the promotion of social justice. Even before the departure of 
the British, Nehru made the Indian people conscious of the 
importance of planning. 
Nehru’s other great contribution to the independence move-
ment was that he gave it an international perspective. He saw 
that fascism, militarism and imperialism were partners and 
against them were ranged popular and national movements all 
over the world. So the independence movement in India was 
part of a universal struggle and its allies were the peoples fight-
ing for freedom and dignity in Europe, Asia and Africa. 
Nehru’s policies as India’s first prime minister, from 1947 till 
his death in 1964, continued to be influenced by these ideals. 
An emphasis on civil liberties and a search for a socialist pat-
tern of society inspired all his efforts within India; while abroad, 
he followed an active policy of support for anti-colonialism and 
anti-racism. He was particularly committed to Africa, which 
he regarded as India’s neighbour. He supported the national 
movements in Kenya, Algeria, Ghana and Nigeria and never 
compromised in his resistance to apartheid. Above all, he was 
a supporter of the United Nations and its agencies, sent Indian 
troops as part of United Nations contingents to Gaza, Suez 
and the Congo and worked to promote total disarmament. 
The contribution of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan to the indepen-
dence movement was of a different order. Imperialism dam-
aged the identity of the Indian people by assuming that West-
ern civilization was superior. In reply Radhakrishnan turned to

years in Delhi, first as Vice-President for ten years and then for 
five years as President, he gave the lead in improving the qual-
ity of life and promoting character. Even while holding these 
high offices and carrying out his duty to his own people, Rad-
hakrishnan continued to travel round the world, advocating the 
emergence of a new civilization based on the unity of mankind 
and common truths of the spirit and animated by a religion not 
founded on dogma but on the deepening of the individual’s 
awareness and compassion for all fellow beings. 
If Radhakrishnan was by birth a Hindu, Abul Kalam Azad was 
born in Mecca of pious Muslim parents; but they both had a 
strong sense of religion based on rationalism and common val-
ues of all humanity transcending creeds and denominations. 
Fluent in Arabic and Persian and a scholar in Islamic studies, 
Azad gave a broad and liberal interpretation of the Qur’an. To 
him religion was a guide to proper action and his scholarship 
led him into public life. From 1912 his primary objective was 
to draw the Muslims in India into the struggle for freedom. 
A steadfast follower of Gandhi, he was elected a number of 
times President of the Indian National Congress and suffered 
long terms of internment and imprisonment. From 1920, po-
litical differences between Hindu and Muslim organizations 
increased; but the Congress insisted that nationalism had no 
connection with religion and the presence of Maulana Azad 
in the ranks of the nationalist leadership was the highest testi-
mony of this. Azad’s pride in being an Indian was strengthened 
by his commitment to what he termed the Islamic spirit, and 
he never accepted that a good Muslim could not be a good 
Indian.  From 1947 till his death in 1958 he served as 
India’s first minister for education and was a key figure in 
the formulation of national policies in all fields. With his be-
lief that true religion brings all peoples together, Azad also 
took much interest in the promotion of international under-
standing and was the president of the General Conference 
of UNESCO at its session in Delhi in 1956.

the sources and, in his writings on Indian philosophy, showed 
that the thought of his people was second to none in logic and 
rationality. This enabled them to hold up their heads. But Rad-
hakrishnan did more. He argued that philosophy was related 
to life and, while interpreting Indian thinkers at their best, also 
called on Indians to discard what was outmoded and to rid 
themselves of obscurantism and superstition. Their long and 
rich tradition had been arrested and required innovation and 
further evolution. Truth should not be allowed to be smothered 
by the dead past. The speculative and scientific thought of the 
West should be incorporated into the Indian heritage. 
Moreover, by expounding Indian thought in terms that related 
to the Western tradition, Radhakrishnan made Indian culture a 
part of world civilization. He, like Nehru, accepted a national-
ism that was a brick in the structure of internationalism and 
his philosophical efforts were intended to build understand-
ing between East and West. A member before the Second 
World War of the International Committee for Intellectual Co-
operation, he was active in UNESCO from its foundation in 
1945. He was a member of UNESCO’s Executive Board, 
served as its chairman, was elected president of the General 
Conference in 1952, and was associated with the opening of 
UNESCO’s Paris Headquarters in the Place de Fontenoy, in 
1958. To him UNESCO was, as he described it, “the priest-
hood of the spirit”. 
Radhakrishnan’s main activity, after India became free, was to 
help in the reconciliation of mankind on the basis of the com-
mon ground among all the religions of the world. He believed 
that a global community was emerging and that humanity 
should be educated to recognize its purpose and destiny. Ap-
pointed by Nehru as India’s ambassador to the Soviet Union, 
Radhakrishnan stood nearly thirty years ago for negotiations 
and peaceful settlements between the two sides in the Cold 
War. In 1952 he came back to India and, for the next fifteen

5000 Years of Indian Culture
          by Vishwanath S. Naravane
he development of Indian culture can be compared to 
the progress of a river from its Himalayan home, through 
forests and wastelands, orchards and farms, villages and 
cities. The river assimilates the waters or many tributaries, 
its environment changes, yet it remains the same. Indian 
culture shows a similar combination of unity and diversity, 
continuity and change. In the course of her long history, 
India has witnessed many changes, made many adjust-
ments, and assimilated elements from many sources, with-
out breaking the continuity. 
India is a land of varied landscapes and climates, of many 
races, religions, languages and cultures. But they all have 
an unmistakably Indian flavour. The source of this unity is 
elusive. It can be felt, but it defies analysis. In his famous 
book, Discovery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru gave a sensitive 
and fascinating account of his search for the unity at the 
root of India’s amazing diversity. 
The Indus Valley civilization (3000-1800 BC) shows an-
ticipations of ideas and art forms later regarded as typically 
Indian. This is clear from the artefacts yielded during exca-
vations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro. A statue of a man 
in meditation suggests the practise of Yoga. The smooth 
surfaces of a male torso in stone suggests, by its absence 
of muscular tension, the classical Indian concept of inward 
energy. A deity depicted on a clay seal is very similar to 
some later images of Shiva. And a little copper dancing-girl 
wears bangles of a kind that can be purchased today at a 
wayside bazaar in India. Recent research has shows that 
the influence of this culture extended to distant regions of 
northern and western India, and that the Indus Valley people 
had close contacts with the Dravidian civilization, which 
flourished in southern India long before the coming of the 
Aryans. 
Some time between 2000 and 1600 BC, a branch of the 
vast Aryan family, usually referred to as Indo-Aryans, migrat-
ed to India. They brought with them the Sanskrit language, 
and a religion based on sacrificial ritual, honouring deities 
symbolizing elemental forces of Nature, such as Indra, god 
of rain and thunder, Agni (Fire) and Varuna, lord of the seas, 
rivers and seasons. Hymns addressed to these and other 
Vishwanath S. Naravane,  
former head of the Departments of Philosophy at the universities  
of Allahabad and Poona, is the author of a number of works  
on Indian cultural history and thought, including Modern Indian Thought, 
Dictionary of Indian Mythology, A Cultural History of Modern India.

deities were collected in the 
four Vedas. The oldest of the Ve-
das is the Rigveda (1500-1200 
BC) in which there is a quest 
for the Supreme Reality underly-
ing all multiplicity. This trend was 
strengthened in the dialogues 
of the Upanishads (900-600 
BC). Vedic poetry is marked by 
lofty ideas, literary beauty and a 
movement from external ritual to 
inward experience. 
Two religions outside the Vedic 
tradition emerged in the sixth 
century BC. The Buddha’s per-
sonality, and his emphasis on 
love, compassion and harmony, 
profoundly influenced Indian 
thought and culture, though Bud-
dhism as an organized religion 
struck deeper roots outside 
India. Jainism, founded by Ma-
havira, stressed truth and non-
violence, and made significant 
contributions to Indian art and 
philosophy. 
In 326 BC, Alexander of Macedon crossed the Indus and 
won a decisive battle. Although he soon turned back, his 
invasion influenced Indian culture by initiating contacts with 
the Greco-Roman world. Six years later, Chandragupta 
Maurya tried to unite the scattered kingdoms and republics 
of India in a centralized empire, with the capital at Patali-
putra (modern Patna in Bihar). His grandson, Ashoka (who 
reigned from 273-237 BC), recoiling from the horrors of 
war, became an ardent Bud-
dhist. The message of com-
passion and gentleness was 
inscribed on rocks and highly 
polished stone columns. The 
capitals surmounting the 
columns are fine pieces of 
sculpture. 
Kings of the Shunga dynas-
ty (185-149 BC) were ortho-
dox Hindus, but there was a 
strong Buddhist revival under 
Kanishka, the Kushan king 
who ruled in north-western In-
dia (78-101 AD). The Gand-
hara style of Buddhist sculp-
ture, strongly influenced by 
Greco-Roman art, developed 
under the Kushans. Another 
centre of Buddhist art was Mathura (south of Delhi).
Pataliputra again became the centre of political and cul-
tural activity during the Gupta Empire (319-540 AD), which 
has been described as the golden age of ancient Indian cul-
ture. Some of the Gupta kings, such as Chandragupta and 
Skandagupta, were poets and musicians. Kalidasa, great-
est among Sanskrit poets and dramatists, lived during the 
reign of Chandragupta. The Buddha images of Sarnath, and 
the frescoes painted in the caves of Ajanta in western India, 
are among the artistic masterpieces of this age. The decline 
of the Gupta Empire was followed by political fragmenta-
tion. King Harsha of Kannauj tried 
to stem this process, but, after 
his death in 648 AD, indepen-
dent kingdoms arose in Kashmir, 
Bengal, Orissa and many other 
regions of southern as well as 
northern India. 
Culturally, this was a very rich 
period. The Cholas, Pallavas and 
Rashtrakutas of south India built 
the superb temples at Tanjore, 
Mamallapuram and Ellora. The 
Sun Temple of Konârak in Orissa 
and the Shiva Temple at Khajura-
ho in Central India were built in 
the eleventh century. In all these 
temples, sculpture is an integral 
part of the architecture. In litera-
ture, Sanskrit was gradually being 
replaced by regional languages 
such as Bengali, Marathi, Hindi 
and Punjabi. In the south, Tamil, 
Telugu and Kannada had devel-
oped their literary traditions. The 
Vedanta philosophies of Shanka-
ra (eighth century) and Ramanuja 
(twelfth century) exerted a deep influence. There was, how-
ever, a conservative trend in social and religious life. The 
caste system, originally based on differences of aptitude, 
became rigid and oppressive. 
The establishment of Muslim rule at the end of the twelfth 
century was a turning point in India’s cultural history. An 
initial period of conflict was inevitable because of the radi-
cal differences between Hinduism and Islam. But a process 
of accommodation soon 
started. Sufi mysticism, phil-
osophically close to Vedan-
ta, was one of the meeting 
points. Many Muslim kings, 
at Delhi and in regional king-
doms, were patrons of Indian 
literature and music, and 
participated in Hindu festi-
vals. After the foundation of 
the Mughal Empire (1526 
AD) the trend towards inte-
gration was strengthened. 
Under the wise and tolerant 
rule of Akbar (1556-1605) 
the foundation of a national 
culture was firmly laid. The 
Hindu and Muslim traditions, 
while retaining their distinct 
identities, influenced each other deeply. 
Islamic architecture in India was at first austere and simple. 
But the builders soon started adopting decorative elements, 
including the lotus motif, from Hindu temples. Conversely, 
many temples built in medieval India have Islamic features, 
such as the dome, the arch and screens carved of stone 
and marble. Indian architecture reached its apex during the 
reign of Shah Jahan (1627-1658), who built such master-
pieces as the Pearl Mosque at Agra and the Taj Mahal, ‘the 
dream in marble’. 
In painting, too, there was a blend of the two traditions.

Inspired by Bihzad and other 
great Persian artists, painters 
at the Mughal court created a 
new style of miniature paint-
ing. Combining the technique 
and subtlety of this style with 
the religious and aesthetic 
spirit of India, painters of the 
Rajput School made their 
own distinctive contribution. 
One of the greatest genius-
es of medieval India was Amir 
Khusrau: poet, musician, and 
linguist. He invented several 
instruments played in clas-
sical Indian music. His po-
etical experiments led to the 
emergence of Urdu, one of 
the major Indian languages. The sixteenth and seventeenth 
centuries were exceptionally rich in devotional poetry in re-
gional languages. Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, Tulsidas, 
whose Hindi version of the Ramayana epic is recited and 
read by millions even today, Kabir, whose poetry transcend-
ed all sectarian differences – these and other saint-poets 
preached a universal religion based on tolerance and love. 
The Mughal Empire declined rapidly during the first quar-
ter of the eighteenth century. Meanwhile, Europeans were 
making inroads into India: the Portuguese, the Dutch, the 
French, and finally the British who emerged victorious. By 
the end of the eighteenth century, British authority was firm-
ly established. The introduction of English education and 
the work of Christian missionaries had a deep impact on the 
cultural and religious life of India. Calcutta, the new capital, 
became the centre of Western thought, followed by Bombay 
and Madras. Some educated Indians, in their excessive zeal 
for European culture, turned away from their own heritage. 
But a reform movement, founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, 
ushered in a spiritual and cultural renaissance. The leaders 
of this movement, known as 
the Brahmo Samaj, stressed 
the deeper truths of Hindu 
and Muslim scriptures, while 
accepting progressive ele-
ments of Western thought. 
Another source of inspiration 
was Sri Ramakrishna (1836-
1886), who regarded differ-
ent religions as paths leading 
to the same goal, and his fa-
mous discipline, Swami Vive-
kananda (1863-1902), who 
is remembered as India’s 
first spiritual and cultural 
ambassador to Europe and 
America. 
Though politically subjugat-
ed, Indian culture retained its dynamism. In the latter half of 
the nineteenth century, novelists and dramatists took up po-
litical, historical and social themes. Ghalib, the great Urdu 
poet, and Bankim Chatterji, the Bengali novelist, made rich 
contributions to Indian literature. Outstanding musicians, 
many of whom were Muslims, kept alive the tradition of clas-
sical Indian music. The kathak school of dance was deve- 
loped at Lucknow and Jaipur. Later, there was a renaissance 
in Indian painting, initiated by Abanindranath Tagore and 
other artists of the Bengal School. Plays based on mytho-
logical as well as modern subjects were staged at Calcutta 
and Bombay. 
Meanwhile, under the leadership of the Indian National 
Congress (founded in 1885) the movement for indepen-
dence was gaining strength. The sense of patriotism thus 
aroused was reflected in the literature of the age. When 
Mahatma Gandhi returned to India, after his heroic struggle 
against racism in South Africa, a new chapter was opened 
in India’s life. 
The Mahatma touched every aspect of Indian life, though

his main concern was with social and political issues. Some 
of the greatest writers of that period – Bharati in Tamil, 
Premchand in Hindi, Sharat Chatterji in Bengali – expressed 
Gandhian ideals in their poems and novels. 
Indian culture in the twentieth century was dominated by 
the towering genius of Rabindranath Tagore, one of the 
greatest poet-philosophers in world history. Tagore left the 
stamp of his personality and work on every field of creativ-
ity: poetry, music, drama, novel and short story, even paint-
ing. He was the first non-Western writer to be awarded the 
Nobel Prize for Literature. He founded the international uni-
versity, Vishwa-Bharati, and anticipated many modern con-

cepts in education. Tagore influenced an entire generation 
of Indian writers and artists. Gandhi and Tagore are rightly 
regarded as the makers of modern India. 
On 15 August 1947, Indian became an independent nation. 
Thus, in Jawaharlal Nehru’s words, India had “kept her tryst 
with destiny” after a century of struggle. The partition of the 
country on the basis of religion, the bloodshed that followed, 
and then the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, were pain-
ful shocks. But the trauma was soon overcome and India 
began building her future as a sovereign country taking her 
rightful place in the community of nations. 
Since independence, India has made significant progress 
in many areas of culture. In almost all the fourteen major 
languages of India (fifteen including English), creative litera-
ture of the highest order has been produced. Satyajit Ray 
is recognized as one of the greatest film directors in the 
world. In classical music, Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan; 
in painting Jamini Ray and M.F. Hussain; in classical dance, 
Balasarasvati – these are only a few among the outstanding 
artists who have enriched Indian culture in recent decades. 
Selectivity, assimilation and adjustment have charac-
terized Indian culture throughout its long history. It has 
confronted and overcome many periods of crisis and 
uncertainty. Today there are new challenges, demanding 
new adjustments. Ours is the age of science and tech-
nology. How to preserve whatever is of enduring worth 
in the spiritual and aesthetic tradition that has stood the 
test of fifty centuries, and how to reinterpret that tradi-
tion in the contemporary context: that is the question 
which the thinkers, artists and writers of India have to 
deal with. Their ability to handle this task in a balanced 
and imaginative manner will determine the future course 
of Indian culture.

Contemporary Indian Films  
for International Understanding
  by Kwaja Ahmad Abbas 
Comparatively speaking, India has had practically no opportunity of exporting her culture through the 
medium of the cinema. The few Indian films that have ever crossed the seas have been seen by very 
limited audiences, and it is still doubtful whether they will ever be able to compete successfully with 
American and European products in the foreign market.
But there is no reason why an attempt should not be made to secure at least a specialized and select 
audience abroad for the right type of Indian films. Some of our Ambassadors have already taken steps 
to secure good Indian films for exhibition in their Embassies. Film societies, cultural organizations and 
educational institutions in all countries would surely welcome opportunities of seeing, from time to 
time, a representative selection of Indian films. 
But it is important that foreign audiences should learn to look at Indian films as a mirror of Indian life, 
and should not expect that universality of interest, which the standardized product from Hollywood 
is able to provide. The foreigner is sometimes apt to complain that Indian films are inordinately long, 
though none of them, so far, has beaten the record of Gone With The Wind. 
It is true, however, that the tempo of story development in an average Indian film is slower than in its 
Hollywood counterpart. So, to a foreigner, it seems longer. 
This criticism applies not only to film-making but to a whole way of life. The Indian films are slow be-
cause the tempo of Indian life is slow. The Indian films will acquire the nervous tension and mounting

tempo of a Hollywood thriller when the impact of industrial-
ism has created the same psychological atmosphere in India 
as in England and America.
The preponderance of songs in an Indian film has been its 
most exasperating feature for foreigners and even for west-
ernized Indians. The commercial (and, therefore, primary) 
reason is that the cinema in India has developed into an om-
nibus entertainment for millions of uprooted peasants and 
small town folk who have lost their rich traditions of folk song 
and folk dance and found nothing to substitute it in the cities 
and the big towns. 
Again, through religious musical expressions like kirtan, 
bhajan and qawwali, the song is woven into the fabric of Indian 
life more closely and intimately than in any other country. 
What kind of Indian films should be shown abroad? There 
can be as many answers as the different varieties of films pro-
duced by us. Some would favour mythological and puranic 
films as they represent the ‘spiritual’ heritage of India; others 
would favour the historical films about our emperors and em-
presses to show to the world ‘the Glory that was India’. No 
doubt their colourful pageantry would appeal to the Western 
audiences as they approximate more closely to the average 
Westerner’s notions of the ‘exotic’ East.
The modern-minded ultra-realists would ban the export 
of all such films and insist that only films on contemporary 
themes should be sent abroad. But, again, there would be a 
divergence of views as to whether it is advisable to send out 
some of our films that expose our social evils, as that might 
create an unfavourable impression about India. 
If the task were left to me, I would select the following ten 
films for international screening. I wouldn’t say they are the 
Ten Best Indian Films, though obviously some of them would 
come in that category; but, taken together, they provide a 
more or less complete cross-section of India – and the In-
dian cinema. Here, then, is my list:
1. Seeta (East Indian Films). This, in my opinion, is the most 
dignified, the most beautiful and the most meaningful mytho-
logical film so far produced in India. It has none of the tinselly 
gaudiness that characterizes some of the more elaborate and 
expensive films on the same theme.
2. Yidyapati (New Theatres). Regarded by many as 
Devaki Bose’s greatest and last masterpiece, this film should be 
included because it handles a typically Indian emotional-mys-
tic theme in an artistic manner, and also represents a distinct 
era in Indian history and a (somewhat idealized) picture of old 
feudal society.
3. Pukar (Minerva). Though technically better films have 
been produced on Moghal themes, this remains the most 
impressive and significant of them all. Through this story of 
Jehangir’s sense of justice, the world will get a glimpse of all 
that was best in the Moghal era.
4. Tukaram (Prabhat). Dozens of devotional pictures about 
every conceivable saint in India have been made, but in utter 
simplicity, fidelity of detail and humanistic approach, Tukaram 
remains unbeaten. One need not believe in miracles or even 
in religion to believe in a human being like Tukuram; the prole-
tarian saint who preached a good life by his good actions. 
5. Devdas (New Theatres). Here is the classic story of emo-
tional frustration, written by the inimitable Sarat Chatterjee, 
and filmed with a youthful artistic flair by Barua. 
6. President (New Theatres). A modern melodrama in 
Hollywood style, the ‘father and founder’ of the boy-meets-
girl films in India, and director/screenwriter Nitin Bose’s 
abiding contribution to Indian film.
7. Unexpected (Prabhat). Directed by Shantaram in the 
days when be believed in utter realism, and the first daring 
and progressive picture on the theme of forced marriages.
8. Bari Didi (New Theatres). The most beautifully poignant 
story or a widow’s frustrated emotions, handled with rare art-
istry and dignified restraint.
9. Dharti Ke Lal or Children of the Earth (People’s 
Theatre). The first non-commercial, realistic feature-docu-
mentary on the grim tragedy of the Bengali Famine. 
10. Doctor Kotnis (Rajkamal). Shantaram’s filmic tribute to 
the young Indian doctor who died a martyr’s death in China, 
while serving humanity, along with the Congress Medical 
Mission. The right note on which to conclude this series of 
films representing India.

The Indian film industry was born and took root in and around 
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, major port cities where there 
was a strong backdrop of intellectual and theatre activities. 
From the 1920’s on, enterprising film-makers in these regions 
made films in a variety of genres such a mythology, history, 
folklore and fantasy, whose popularity cut across social barri-
ers. These films were products of the studio system. The ma-
jor studios had distinct identities of their own. Three of them in 
particular left a mark on Indian cinema in the 1930s. 
New Theatres Limited, with its famous banner of a trum-
peting elephant, was the vision of Birendra Nath Sircar, a civil 
engineering graduate of London University, who gathered a 
group of talented men around him and raised Indian cinema 
from the status of a novel form of entertainment to that of an 
art. New Theatres was a nursery for a number of directors and 
actors who later became household names. 
As one cinema historian has written, “Sircar wanted not a 
production company, studio and cinema halls, but a system,

a pervasive, self-supporting, efficiently managed, supremely 
equipped network of men and women and machines which 
would sell the celluloid dream like it had never been sold be-
fore in India, in markets determined by the caprice of public 
preference.” The artistes, who worked as salaried staff and 
not on contract, had to be at the studios whether or not they 
were working on a film; when not acting, an actor might be 
given riding or fencing lessons or assigned temporary techni-
cal duties. 
New Theatres’ first big success, Chandidas, was based on 
the life of a Hindu saint. With Devdas, adapted from a famous 
Bengali novel, it captured the huge all-India market. Most 
Indian films had hitherto been vehicles for song-and-dance 
sequences, but Devdas was a serious treatment of a power-
ful dramatic situation. A fire in the studios in 1940 and later 
a sharp financial decline brought about the demise of New 
Theatres in 1955. The impact of communalism in the 1940s 
and the advent of the star system also helped to seal its fate.

moved to a fine location on the outskirts of Pune, 100 miles 
south of Bombay, covering a wide expanse ranging from hilly 
tracks to marshland. The facilities at this great film production 
complex, which had no highbrow pretensions, ranged from 
a huge studio and art factories to accommodations for the 
staff and actors. 
The veteran actress, Durga Khote, recalled later, “At Prabhat 
we reported for work at 5:30 in the morning, and we knew 
that shooting would be definitely over by 4:30 in the after-
noon. There was no departure from this routine as shooting 
was done in sunlight, and no artificial lights or arc lights were 
used. We were called for work at 5:30 because it took two 
full hours for make-up with the hard grease of the old days. 
By 8 o’clock we were ready for takes, and by tea-time we 
used to pack up, as no more shooting was possible 
with the fading sunlight.”
Prabhat Studio made many good films, in-
cluding Amrit Manthan (‘Churning of Nec-
tar’), produced by V. Shantaram after his 
return from a study tour of German stu-
dios. Amrit Manthan was a milestone 
in film technique and evoked a wide-
ranging humanitarian appeal on the 
issue of animal sacrifice. Prabhat’s 
peak period lasted barely ten years 
since it could not cover a wider 
market due to its early regional lan-
guage films in Marathi.
In addition to these three studio 
units, an equally strong complex of 
studios arose in the mid-1930s in Ma-
dras, South India. Films in the South In-
dian languages enjoyed autonomy from the 
all-embracing Hindi film market. Modern The-
atres near Madras, founded by T. R. Sundaram in 
1936, had a staff of 250 and made an average of three 
films per year.

The second important studio, Bombay Talkies, was found-
ed in 1934 by Human Rai and became the true precursor of 
the Indian commercial cinema. Its films captivated audiences 
with a blend of political and social comment, glamour, melo-
drama and melodious soundtracks. Achhut Kanya (1936) is 
the tragic tale of an Untouchable girl in love with a Brahmin 
youth, who ends by giving up her life on the altar 
of caste barriers and religious bigotry. Films 
such as Savitri (1937), a mythological 
tale from the Mahabharata, effec-
tively captured Hindu values and 
sentiments. 
Foreign technicians, mainly 
German and British, were em-
ployed at the Talkies, and a 
lot of modern equipment was 
used. A staff of more than 
400 Indians ate together 
in the company canteen, ir-
respective of the castes to 
which they belonged. Well-
known actors would sweep the 
floors if need be. Famous au-
thors conducted seminars for the 
staff, who were assigned a variety of 
duties to broaden their knowledge of 
the film medium. 
Prabhat Studio was launched by a group of 
men who had learned their trade as junior apprentices in 
a film company in Kolhapur. One member of the team had 
done odd jobs at the Bombay docks before becoming the

Women Painters  
of Northern India 
The paintings reproduced on the following colour pages have been produced by village women of Mithila, a province in 
Bihar State, in northeast India. The women create these masterpieces in their spare time from the daily routine of 
cooking, caring for children and working in the fields.
Mithila’s women conjure up vivid colours, by skilful mixing of minerals and vegetables: blue from the leaves of the 
indigo plant, yellow from orpiment (a natural mineral form of arsenic), red from logwood or sandalwood. Mixtures 
of these colours give them green and orange hues. Their paintings, full of grace and elegance, portray scenes from 
the lives of the gods – Krishna with his flute, Shiva with his wives, some gentle, some fearsome to behold, as well 
as episodes from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, depicting exploits of men and animals who are none other than 
gods in disguise. Delicately executed with brushes improvised from bamboo splinters to which wads of wild cotton 
are attached, the paintings are executed on the occasion of various ceremonies and celebrations. They adorn the 
walls of marriage chambers, em-
bellish the wrapping paper 
for ritual gifts, and also deco-
rate the letters, known as 
‘kohabars’ in which Mithila girls 
traditionally ask for a husband’s 
hand. Using rice-water and 
dung, Mithila women trace out 
remarkable images on court-
yard floors, to mark the altars, 
or ‘Aripanas’, where household 
rituals are performed.
In these many ways the wom-
en of Mithila apply their creative 
talents to various aspects of 
everyday life, while adding 
colour and lustre to festivals or 
prayer. Long unknown outside 
their province, their exquisite 
work is today much sought 
after by art collectors and mu-
seum curators, and, recog- 
nizing their talents, the govern- 
ment of Bihar now provides 
these women with paper for their 
work.
Their art has now been revealed 
to the Western world through 
collections brought back from 
Mithila – a small province 
which 1500 years ago was 
one of India’s first kingdoms 
– by a French writer and 
teacher, Yves Véquaud. Exhibi-
tions have been held in Paris 
at the Musée de l’Homme 
(in 1973), and at the Musée des 
Arts Décoratifs (early in 1975). 
They have shown how Mithila’s 
ancient traditional art, created 
entirely by the skill and talents 
of women artists, has been pre-
served and enriched.

Shah Jahan’s Heaven and Hell: 
the Red Fort in Delhi
           by Appasamy Murugaiyan 
f there be a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, reads the 
inscription at the entrance of Qala-a-Mubarak’a’. The couplet 
by the Persian poet Amir Khusrau reveals the intention of 
Shah Jahan’s architects. They designed a citadel to match 
the Koran’s description of paradise, not unlike Ispahan in 
Iran.   
Shah Jahan is known as the man who so loved his favourite 
wife, Mumtaz Mahal, “light of the palace”, that after she died 
in 1631, he put 20,000 builders to work on the famous Taj 
Mahal in Agra; the mausoleum in her memory was inscribed 
on the World Heritage List in 1983. He was also a mighty 
emperor who brought the greatest glory to the Mughal em-
pire, founded in the 16th century by Babur, “The Leopard”, 
descendant of the fierce warlord Tamerlane – to whom we 
owe another fabulous World Heritage site, the 14th century 
Samarkand, now in Uzbekistan.   
Shah Jahan will undoubtedly be remembered as the dy-
nasty’s greatest art lover and builder. His legacy, the Qala-
a-Mubarak’a’, known as the Red Fort, was a citadel at the 
heart of the capital, serving as both imperial residence and 
government headquarters.
Appasamy Murugaiyan is professor of comparative and historical  
linguistics at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and researcher  
at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, in Paris. He is the author 
of ‘The Great Indian Temple of Tanjavur’ (The UNESCO Courier 1995 - 2)  
and ‘The Indian Dilemma’ (The UNESCO Courier 2008 - 1).
The new red capital
When he decided to move the capital from Agra to Delhi 
in 1638, the emperor gave orders to build his “paradise on 
earth” on the banks of the river Yamuna, just like the Taj Ma-
hal. Today it is called Old Delhi, but then it bore the name of 
its founder: Shahjahanabad.   
Begun in 1639 and completed probably in 1648, the Red 
Fort accommodated some 3000 people. It is the first Mughal 
palace fort designed according to an octagonal grid pattern, 
which later became an architectural characteristic of the dy-
nasty. Made primarily in brick, clad with sandstone or red 
marble, it represents a harmonious fusion of Persian, Timurid 
and Indian elements, yet it is based on Islamic prototypes. 
The unique style, also distinguished by its complex geometric 
compositions, is named after the emperor: Shahjahani.

Connected in the north to Salimgarh, an earlier fort built 
by Isma Shah Sur in 1546, the walls of the Red Fort stretch 
out for more than two kilometres. Their height varies from 16 
metres on the river to 36 metres 
on the town side. Two entrances 
allowed access to the citadel: the 
Delhi and Lahori gates. The first 
was used by soldiers and servants 
of the court. The second, facing 
the town of Lahore and giving 
onto the Chatta Chowk (palace 
market) was reserved for visitors 
and the emperor himself. A wide 
north-south road ran alongside the market. It set the border 
between the military camp to the west and the palace in the 
east.
When the powerful and inconsolable Shah Jahan arrived 
for a public audience in the hall designated for that purpose, 
the Diwan-i-Am, he passed by the drum house (naubat khana 
or naqqarkhana), a three-storey rectangular building for the 
musicians. In the audience hall stood the throne, incrusted 
with semi-precious stones, as elaborate and majestic as Solo-
mon’s if not an actual copy.   
But an even more sumptuous throne awaited him in the Diwan- 
i-Khas, the hall for private audiences, where he met his minis-
ters and courtiers. More than 100 rubies and the same num-
ber of emeralds enhanced the splendour of the two peacock 
effigies standing behind the royal seat, as well as countless 
diamonds, sapphires and rare pearls. The famous Peacock 
Throne had been taken as war booty from Iran by Nadir Shah. 
It was in 1739, a century after construction of the Red Fort had 
begun, when the “Persian Napoleon” had devastated Delhi 
with fire and sword.   
Having disposed of affairs of state, Shah Jahan retired to the 
Khas Mahal, his private pavilion with bedrooms, prayer rooms 
and a tower from which the emperor would speak to the peo-
ple. The Khas Mahal was part of a series of royal pavilions in 
white marble giving onto the Yamuna, linked one to the other 
by a channel whose sparkling waters justified its name of Nahr-
i-Behisht, the stream of paradise.   
To relax, Shah Jahan would retreat 
to one of the hammams, where hot 
and cold water flowed through pipes 
and the walls’ floral motifs created the 
impression of a garden. And at the 
southern end of the alignment was 
the ultimate paradise: the zenanas, 
or women’s quarters, consisting of 
one-storey pavilions also linked with channels and pools. His 
wives and mistresses lived in the Rang Mahal pavilion (palace 
of colours), with ceilings adorned with gold and silver motifs 
reflecting the water and white marble of the magnificent lotus 
pool, a favourite ingredient of Mughal architecture. 
  
Symbol of power   
Shah Jahan lived less than 20 years in earthly paradise and 
ten years in hell, in the very same place. When he fell ill in 1657, 
he was deposed and imprisoned in the fort until his death in 
1666, by his own son Aurangbzeb.   
Thanks to the latter we have the Moti Jasjid, the Pearl Mosque, 
which he built for his own use in 1659, to the west of his father’s 
hammams. The white marble mosque’s prayer room floor is in-
laid with the outline of a prayer carpet in black marble. To the 
north of the mosque is laid out the splendid Hayat-Baksh Bagh, 
the life-giving garden, its sections also separated by water.   
But little remains of the heavenly gardens. Since its construc-
tion, the fort has undergone much modification, the British in 
particular considerably changing its structure. In 1857, when the 
British crown took command of the Raj, it made the fort the Brit-
ish Indian Army’s headquarters. As a result, pavilions were torn 
down and colonial style military buildings replaced them, while 
Mughal gardens were transformed into English ones.   
In 1947, after India declared its independence, the Indian army 
took over the Red Fort and turned it into the symbol of the British 
colonial power’s defeat. The proof: the first Independence Day 
celebrations took place there, on 15 August 1947. And since 
then, every year, the Prime Minister gives his Independence Day 
speech on this historically significant site.

A Matter of 
Choice 
            by Amartya Sen
Amartya Sen, born in 1933, is a distinguished Indian economist  
and philosopher who was awarded the Nobel Price in Economics, in 1998. 
Famous for his writings on development and globalization,  
he is Professor of Economics and Philosophy  
and Lamont University Professor at Harvard University (U.S.A).
here are two ways of looking at development in the contem-
porary world. One, deeply influenced by growth economics 
and the values that underlie it, regards development as es-
sentially a rapid and sustained expansion of gross national 
(or domestic) product per head, perhaps qualified by some 
requirement that the fruits of this expansion reach all sec-
tions of the community. I shall call this ‘the opulence view of 
development.’ In this approach, values and culture have no 
foundational place. 
A second, contrasting view sees development as a process 
that enhances the freedom of those involved to pursue what-
ever objectives they value. In this, which I shall call ‘the effec-
tive freedom view of development’, the importance of eco-
nomic opulence is left to the values of the people involved, 
and is thus culturally conditioned. 
In line with this view of development, the expansion of hu-
man capability may be described as the central feature of 
development. The concept of a person’s ‘capability’ can be 
traced back to Aristotle, for whom the life of a person could 
be seen as a sequence of things the person does, or states 
of being he or she achieves, and which constitute a collection 
of ‘functionings’. ‘Capability’ refers to the alternative combina-
tions of functionings from which a person can choose. Thus, 
the notion of capability is essentially one of freedom – the 
range of options a person has in deciding what kind of life to 
lead. Poverty, in this view, lies not merely in the impoverished 
state in which a person may actually live, but also in the lack 
of real opportunity – imposed by social constraints as well 
as personal circumstances – to choose other types of living. 
Even low incomes, meagre possessions, and other aspects 
of what are standardly seen as economic poverty are relevant 
ultimately because of their role in curtailing capabilities (that 
is, in severely restricting people’s opportunities to lead valu-
able and valued lives). 
The application of this broader view of development thus 
involves specific hypotheses about the values people have 
reason to cherish. Economists who have studied this prob-
lem have been particularly attentive to indicators of quality of 
life such as longevity, good health, adequate nutrition, basic 
education, absence of gender-based inequality, and basic 
political and social freedoms. 
This approach, which is based on people’s values, differs 
from the radical a priori judgement implicit in the ‘opulence’ 
view of development. If, given the choice, people would rather 
have longer and more disease-free lives with more autonomy, 
than a higher level of GNP per head, then the ‘effective free-
dom’ view of development can be applied to their case, but 
not the ‘opulence’ view of development.
In the opulence view of development, the focus is uncom-
promisingly on the growth of incomes. However, while classi-
cal economic theorists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill 
did indeed write a great deal on the growth of real income 
per head, they saw income as one of several different means 
to important ends, and they discussed extensively the nature 
of these ends – very different as they are from income. 
Smith, Mill and other classical authors were deeply con-
cerned with the idea that we value many things other than 
income and wealth, which relate to real opportunities to lead 
the kinds of life we would value living. Their writings reveal 
great interest in the foundational importance of our ability to 
do the things we value, and have reason to value. They com-
mented fairly extensively on the connection between these 
matters, on the one hand, and income, wealth, and other eco-
nomic circumstances, on the other, and they had much to say 
on public policies that support and promote the more basic 
ends on which we may choose to concentrate. 
Evaluating economic growth
In the opulence view of development, the role of culture is 
purely instrumental, helping in particular to promote rapid 
economic growth. The question thus arises as to whether 
economic growth can be valued for its own sake, thus lead-
ing to the treasuring of those things (including culture) that 
promote growth? Or is economic growth itself an instrument, 
with less claim to a foundational role than cultural aspects of 
human life may have? It is hard to think that people have good 
reason to value goods and services irrespective of what they 
do to our freedom to live in a way we would value. It is also 
difficult to accept that culture can have a purely instrumental 
role. Surely, what we have reason to value must be itself a 
matter of culture, and in this sense we cannot reduce cul-
ture to a subsidiary position as a mere promoter of economic 
growth. How can we make our reasoned valuing completely 
valueless?
It is thus important to acknowledge the far-reaching instru-
mental functions of culture in development but also recognize 
that culture cannot be reduced to these functions. Culture 
also plays, for example, an intrinsic role in evaluating the pro-
‘The tree of life’, a collective work made by children, UNESCO, 1979.

cess of economic development, as well as in making room 
for less immediate objectives such as sustaining the environ-
ment and preserving the diversity of species. 
Some cultural parameters can help, and others will hinder, 
the fulfilment of these objectives, and we have grounds for 
valuing those cultural attitudes and features that foster this 
fulfilment. But, when we turn to the more basic question, 
namely, why concentrate on these objectives, culture must 
appear not as a servant of ends, but as the social basis of 
those ends themselves. We cannot begin to understand the 
so-called ‘culture dimension of development’ without taking 
note of each of these two roles of culture.  
A foundational role
Since the language of ‘sustaining’ has become common 
in the literature of development, it is not surprising that the 
phrase ‘culturally sustainable development’ has made its ap-
pearance. Is this the right direction to take, in moving away 
from a purely instrumental view of culture in development?
There are two major drawbacks in using language of this 
kind. First, it ignores the constitutive role of culture. If culture 
is only to do the ‘sustaining’, we still have to ask what is to be 
sustained? Focusing on ‘culturally sustainable development’ 
is to alienate culture from its foundational role in judging de-
velopment, and to treat it just as a means of sustaining ‘de-
velopment’ – no matter how that is defined. This is, in other 
words, an ornamental debasement of culture to the status 
of a glorified instrument in sustaining ‘development’, defined 
independently. 
The second problem comes from a different direction. Cul-
ture admits of dynamism, evolution and refinement. Culture 
in every country in the world has changed over the centuries. 
The rhetoric of ‘sustaining’ – as opposed to having freedom 
to grow and develop – frames the cultural debate in prema-
turely conservationist terms. There is a dis-analogy with the 
environment, here. When it comes to the natural environ-
ment, we don’t try to improve the best that nature gave us; 
we try to ‘conserve’ what we have got, and perhaps return 
to what we had earlier. But culture is the foundation of our 
creativity and progress. Sustaining is too feeble a role for it 
to play in development. Once we shift our attention from the 
purely instrumental view of culture and accept its construc-
tive and creative role, we have to see development in terms 
that include cultural development as well. 
The three roles of culture
Culture comes into development in three quite distinct  
– though interrelated – ways.
Constitutive role: Development in the broadest sense 
includes cultural development. Cultural development is a 
basic and inseparable component of development in general. 
If people are deprived of the opportunity to understand and 
cultivate their creativity, then that, in itself, is a hindrance to 
development (not just because it may hurt economic growth, 
or some other externally specified objective). Basic educa-
tion is thus important, not just for the help that it might give 
to economic growth, but because it is an essential part of 
cultural development. 
Evaluative role: What we value may, ultimately, be influ-
enced by culture. There is no externally sanctified impor-
tance to economic growth or any other such objective, and 
the things that we intrinsically value reflect the impact of our 
culture. Even if the same things are valued in many different 
societies (if, for example, longer and happier lives without ill-
health are sought in many quite different societies), this does 
not make them independent of values or cultures, but only 
indicates the congruence of valuational reasons in distinct 
societies. 
Instrumental role: No matter what objectives we value, 
their pursuit is, to some extent, influenced by the nature of our 
cultures and ethics. While there is more to culture than this, 
we must not ignore the fact that cultural parameters do inter 
alia have strong instrumental roles. This applies not merely to 
the promotion of economic growth, but also to the achieve-
ment of other objectives such as raising the quality of life. 
Central to culture is freedom, and in particular, the free-
dom to decide what we have reason to value, and what lives 
we have reason to seek. The instrumental, the evaluative 
and the constructive roles of culture all relate, ultimately, to 
this freedom.

and culture have no foundational place”.

Vandana Shiva  
                         talks to Judithe Bizot
You are a physicist  
who abandoned your country’s 
nuclear energy programme  
to devote yourself to nature 
and to halting its destruction. 
How did you reach  
your present position?
Ever since I was a child, love and 
knowledge of nature have given me my 
deepest satisfaction. I was very lucky 
to have been born the daughter of a 
forester in India and to have grown up 
in the Himalayan forest. Then I studied 
physics. The real bases of nature, as 
defined in the reductionist scheme of 
things, are understood through phys-
ics, the foundation of all the sciences. 
I had the opportunity to study biology 
and chemistry too, but real, profound 
understanding of nature was supposed 
to be reached through physics. Then I 
went into nuclear physics, where I ex-
perienced massive disappointments. It 
was only when I was doing my mas-
ter’s degree that I realized how unthink-
ing nuclear scientist were about the 
question of radiation hazards. We were 
taught how to create chain reactions in 
nuclear material and we knew all about 
energy transformations, and so on, but 
nothing about the interaction of radia-
tion with living systems. I learned about 
radiation impacts from my sister, who 
is a doctor. When I was working in a 
nuclear reactor in India she kept say-
ing: “Promise me you’re never going to 
go back there!” “But why?” I’d say and 
she would reply, “but you could have 
babies with mutations. You don’t know 
what’s going to happen to you.”
When I was groping my way and ex-
ploring these issues, senior physicists 
would say, “You don’t need to know 
these things.” Again, this was an ex-
clusion and a violation of my search 
for knowledge. If science means to 
know, then I had no scientific training. 
So I went to Canada and enrolled on 
a Foundations of Physics programme, 
where some of the basic questions 
about science that were troubling me 
were being asked. 
I knew that if I continued studying the 
foundations of quantum theory I should 
be marginal to my situation and I decid-
ed that I must do something to relate 
myself to the Indian context. I shifted to 
science and technology policy issues. 
In the meantime, the Chipko movement 
had been created and because this had 
happened where I was from, I kept go-
ing back and doing volunteer work and 
writing for them. Before I knew where I 
was, ecology had become my primary 
concern. 
What is the Chipko movement? 
In your book Staying Alive you 
talk of the forest, for instance, 
not as a product for the market 
but as ‘prakiti’ – a life-giving 
force. You talk of the impor-
tance of women in the struggle 
against the massive consump-
tion of natural resources. 
I responded to the destruction of the 
forest first because I was a child of the 
Himalayan forests. They were my iden-
tity and my sense of being. The erosion 
of the forests hit me very hard. Just be-
fore I left for Canada, I wanted to go 
back and visit a favourite spot of mine, 
a place where the British had built lovely 
rest houses from which the foresters 
managed the forests. There was one I 
particularly loved, near a stream in the 
beautiful oak forest. I went back there, 
and the oak forest had become a mere 
sprinkling of trees, and the stream was 
no longer gushing with water. When I 
talked to the people in the area I found 
that the stream had disappeared be-
cause they had cut the oak forest down 
to plant apple orchards, an enterprise 
which had never really been successful. 
(Apple trees need very fertile soil and 
virgin forest is usually cut down for this 
purpose.)
As for my involvement with Chipko, a 
movement of Himalayan women dedi-
cated to the protection of the environ-
ment, I first got to know a leading fig-
Vandana Shiva is an Indian physicist and feminist militant,  
who works with many community action groups fighting against environmental destruction.  
In this interview she examines the links between the ecological crisis,  
the marginalization of women and the dominant model of economic development.

ure in the movement, named Sundarlal 
Batinguna, who was a great inspiration 
to people like myself. But at a second 
and more lasting level, my involvement 
was with the ordinary women who form 
the bedrock of Chipko. It was their per-
ceptions and their beliefs that were the 
really rich foundations of my knowledge 
of ecology. They offered me a new sensi-
bility about relationships. Ordinary peo-
ple don’t theorize. They have visions and 
beliefs. The germ of an idea or insight 
that I have developed has always been a 
phrase or an action from a person com-
mitted to act in a concrete situation. All 
my theory-building has come out of this 
nature-centred and women-centred ac-
tion. The special relationships women 
have with the environment are due to 
this. In my book Staying Alive I attempt-
ed to explain why my insights came from 
women who were considered ignorant 
and marginal, who were not given a plat-
form of any kind by society.
Why is it that women sense destruc-
tion faster and are more persevering in 
the struggles against destruction? Why 
do they carry on, when everyone else 
is cynical and hopeless? The reason is 
that women have a distinctive percep-
tion of what life is, a sense of what is 
really vital, which colours their view of 
what is at stake in the world. 
Can women lead the way  
in the new concern  
for the environment?
I think women are taking the lead today. 
The important thing is that their leader-
ship should be taken seriously. For us 
in India, Chipko marked the reawaken-
ing of an ecological consciousness, in 
a movement stretching from the villages 
of central India to the western Ghats. 
This new ecological consciousness is 
as old as our civilization, but what is new 
is its re-emergence as a political force 
in response to destruction, a force like 
Chipko in which ordinary women define 
the issues. 
It doesn’t take much effort to say, ‘let’s 
bring women in’. The crucial issue is 
let’s not push women out. Because of 
its very specific nature, the relationship 
between women and the environment 
differs from one place to another. The 
movements that have led me towards 
my own commitments and decisions 
originate in the most marginal sectors 
of our society, in the so-called backward 
communities and specifically among the 
women of those communities. 
If societies have succeeded in repro-
ducing themselves for centuries, they 
are examples of sustainability. Today, 
unfortunately, these are the societies 
that are labelled backward, whereas 
the societies that give up too quickly 
traditional ways of doing things are 
called progressive. That definition, of 
course, is biased. It is in countries like 
India that you find groups of women 
who are embedded both in nature and 
in sustainable cultures. Perennial civili-
zations, not ones that burst into growth 
and collapse, have something very spe-
cial to offer. They enshrine the capacity 
to regenerate, the capacity to heal, the 
capacity to give and take, to build and 
create. 
But I believe that women in the North 
are also intimately linked to the environ-
ment. Even in the most advanced soci-
eties, women have been left to care for 
children, homes and health. A wonderful 
study was carried out in Helsinki which 
showed that, whatever yardstick you 
take – time, energy, work – women are 
running Finnish society and the Finnish 
economy. It’s wrong to say that women 
are unproductive, that they don’t 
work. It is often said that women 
who stay at home do not work, 
but in fact they work harder 
than anyone else. 
Nature for me comprises 
the life-giving forces, the life-
support systems, the ecological 
systems that make life possible. 
These things are violated in the 
cities and in the country through 
nuclear hazards, toxic wastes, 
contaminated water 
and polluted air. We need those life- 
giving sources of pure air, pure water, 
pure food, no matter where we are. 
Are we not in the process  
of amputating something  
from ourselves by rapidly  
diminishing our powers  
of regeneration?
The term ‘feminine principle’ is basi-
cally just an English translation of prakiti, 
a force in nature and life which exists 
all round us, in women and in men. To 
me, the rise of modern patriarchy tend-
ed to kill the feminine principle in all its 
fullness, and in particular to annihilate 
it totally in man. In a sense, the rise of 
the masculine mode of knowledge, pro-
duction and governance was a way of 
crushing something essential to soci-
ety as a whole – to males and females. 
Fortunately, however, whereas the patri-
archs considered that they were ruling 
over passive creatures (women and 
nature), they could never fully take that 
life away. They could distort and stifle it 
but they couldn’t destroy it entirely. 
I can’t imagine any recovery or 
flowering of these creative forces 
of nature, of women coming into 
their own, that would leave men 
untouched. Men will do one of 
two things. Either they will react 
violently because this flowering cre-
ates a new kind of insecurity and 
inadequacy. Or, hopefully, more 
men will sense that they have im-
poverished themselves, and the 
feminine principle will emerge as 
A woman carrying water (1962).

a creative force which values nurture 
above domination, sustaining above de-
struction, rooted and experienced con-
crete knowledge above abstract, irrele-
vant knowledge. Surely these values are 
important enough for men to recognize 
and support them. 
Are you saying that  
male-dominated knowledge 
should be thrown out?
Every society except contemporary 
industrial society has had criteria as to 
what it should say ‘no’ to. Industrial so-
ciety is the only one which believes that 
if you have the power to do something 
you must do it. Indian philosophy is built 
on the concept that ‘yes, you might have 
the power, but it is important that you use 
your discrimination in the exercise of that 
power’. A society should be able to make 
choices and judgements about means, 
to have values as ends. 
I feel that plurality of choice creates an 
opportunity to decide what is needed 
and desirable, and what is not, and what 
is good and what is not. If that kind of 
opportunity is honestly and scientifi-
cally made available to society, with 
the idea of maintaining quality of 
life, with participation by people, then 
it will undoubtedly be taken. It should 
also be recognized that scientists 
are as fallible as anyone else and that 
science and its institutions are more 
often that not prostituted to eco-
nomic interests, since the structure 
of power is so closely married to the 
structure of knowledge. Many technolo-
gies are used to serve the economic 
interests of the powerful, not choices 
based on ecology and ethics. Women 
have already made their choices on 
these issues. 
Does the exploration of other 
planets have a place in a 
world-view that is concerned 
with improving the quality of 
life, joy, sharing and meeting 
basic needs?
It’s all right to explore. What is wrong is 
to justify the exploration of outer space 
in terms of solving the problems of this 
planet. I believe it is immoral to use peo-
ple and their needs as the reasons for 
outer-space programmes, which should 
be seen as what they are: the indulgence 
of a group of very privileged people and 
countries. Everyone has a right to explore, 
but to use that right as an imperative into 
which everyone must fit is another mat-
ter. It’s hiding the other agendas which 
go along with space programmes, which 
In what specific ways do local 
communities understand or 
use planetary knowledge? 
Traditional systems of agriculture in every 
society have been based on the relation-
ships between planets, which have pro-
vided the basis for deciding which is the 
right time to sow and which crops should 
be grown together. For example, many 
peasants possess a kind of scientific 
knowledge which enables them to rec-
ognize certain types of insect behaviour 
which indicate impending floods, so that 
they move out in time. But all this is a thing 
of the past because pesticides have killed 
these living indicators. We create systems 
which seem more reliable than traditional 
systems but are actually more vulnerable. 
I see two ways in which industrial soci-
ety has been impoverished. Ethically, it is 
the only society which cannot distinguish 
between good and bad, which does not 
provide a chance to say no, which has 
no restraining criteria, values or limits to 
action. Secondly, it seems to lack any 
realization that its systems are increas-
ingly based on highly vulnerable forms of 
organization. There is no comprehension 
of how these systems break down when 
most needed. If my relationship to nature 
provides me with knowledge and a fee- 
ling for what’s happening to the world and 
what changes are coming, it helps me 
guide and protect my animals, myself and 
others. I have certain indicators available 
to me without risk of breakdown by which 
I can act in informed ways. Satellites, 
computer networks and so on are made 
to replace what is considered reliable, 
but they are actually more vulnerable. 
What influence can women 
have? How can they make 
a difference? How can 
they improve their lives 
and their environment?
The first thing is that they should not 
lose faith in the knowledge they have 
and that they should trust in them-
selves. I also believe that when those 
Himalayan streams were disappear-
ing women knew that deforestation is 
linked to desertification and stood their 
ground, even though the foresters said 
that forests have no link with watershed 
management. Women’s instruments of 
resistance are standing their ground, 
believing in their knowledge, having faith 
in their values, not losing confidence, 
not feeling inferior. The dominating sys-
tem imposes its choice on people by 
transforming every multiple choice into 
a tragic last possible one. Things are not 
black or white. I think that in our time it is 
very important to be able to turn around 
and say, no matter how powerless one 
is, well things could be different, could 
they not? I don’t think that merely in-
creasing the number of choices neces-
sarily enriches people’s lives. The criteria 
of choice are what really count. Merely 
to increase the number of choices is to 
adopt a supermarket mentality of con-
sumer choice. It is essential to know 
when a choice is not a real choice, and 
that is impossible unless people have 
a sense of discrimination within them. 
Relating to nature, being embedded in 
it, provides the ethnical framework for 
choice between different scientific and 
technological options.

What is your attitude to global, 
planetary, management and 
the question of local versus 
global ecologies?
So-called ‘primitive’ peoples have always 
had a planetary cosmology, and for them 
the planet has existed in every action 
that they have taken. The most isolated 
communities have had a view not just of 
this planet but of how it relates to others 
and of how balance must be maintained. 
The planetary has always existed in the 
local. Any attempt to disenfranchise lo-
cal communities of their planetary con-
sciousness is unethical.

adaj is a desolate place about 40 km from the historic city 
of Baroda in India’s Gujarat state. During the summer months 
the baked earth cracks in the heat. When the monsoon comes, 
villagers perch on the furniture like chickens to avoid the ris-
ing waters. After the floods have subsided, the waterlogged 
clay soil is impenetrable, trapping cattle and people alike. For 
the past four years, the tin shacks of Vadaj have been home 
for dozens of families forced to leave their ancestral village to 
make way for the giant reservoir of the controversial Sardar 
Sarovar dam on the Narmada river.
These ‘oustees’ could even count themselves lucky. Ac-
cording to a report by Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), a 
pressure group fighting the Narmada project, when the Bargi 
dam was finished in 1990, over 1000 km upstream in Mad-
hya Pradesh, the 114,000 people from 162 villages in the 
path of the floodwaters were simply jettisoned with nowhere 
to go. The government, says NBA, offered no resettlement 
land and only minimal cash compensation. Many of these vil-
lagers, says the report, now have menial jobs in the slums of 
Jabalpur, the main city in the region.
 The plight of the Vadaj oustees could be shared by over 
300,000 others as construction moves slowly ahead on the 
30 large dams, 150 medium and 3000 smaller dams in a 
vast project that will transform the Narmada into a staircase 
of reservoirs and turbines. For the past 15 years, the backlash 
of opposition from NBA, a coalition of local people’s move-
ments opposed to the different dams, has been challenging 
the view of development that these dams promote. NBA ar-
gues that the beneficiaries of the project will be city dwellers, 
not the rural communities forced to leave their homes in the 
flooded valley.
 Over 80 per cent of India’s rural households have no elec-
tricity – and little hope of ever being connected to the elec-
tricity grid – according to Arundhati Roy, the acclaimed In-
dian author who has recently championed NBA’s struggle. 
She says the increased food that the dams’ irrigation canals 
may produce will be destined for export, doing little to feed 
the nation’s poor. In 1995, she says, some 30 million tons 
of unsold grain were stockpiled in state granaries, while 350 
million Indians still live below the poverty line. What is more, 
most of the people affected by the Narmada project, says 
NBA, are tribal communities, fishing villages and Dalits (the 
so-called ‘oppressed’ lower stratum of the Hindu caste sys-
tem), who already benefit least from India’s prosperity.
 The notion of dam building as a prime technology solution 
to development is not new. Back in the 1940s, just after Inde-
pendence, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru saw dams as ‘the 
Temples of Modern India’. The Narmada Valley Development 
Project was to be a showcase for this vision. Although this 
particular project stayed on the drawing board for over 30 
years, mostly because of disputes over water rights between 
the three states – Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat 
– through which the Narmada flows, India went on to build 
some 3600 dams.
 Coupled to the Green Revolution of the 1960s, these dams 
provided massive irrigation systems that have underpinned a 
fourfold increase in food production. And similar prospects

are being heralded for the Narmada dams. According to of-
ficial figures, the Sardar Sarovar dam, the last and largest of 
the dams before the river reaches the Arabian Sea, will pro-
vide water for 20-30 million people all year round, especially 
in the arid areas of Kutch, Saurashtra and the state of Rajas-
than. At the same time, the 138.6 metre multi-purpose dam 
is scheduled to produce 1450 MW of hydroelectric power, 
while its reservoir should smooth out the yearly seesaw of 
floods and droughts, protecting some 400,000 people.
NBA contests just about all the official statistics on the fu-
ture benefits of the project. It 
also questions the very princi-
ple of the dams from the point 
of view of development. Led 
by Medha Patkar, a sociologist 
originally from Bombay, NBA 
argues that the benefits will 
never justify the irreversible 
loss of forest, fisheries, farm-
land, culture and livelihood for 
the hundreds of thousands of 
displaced people. Some 30 
million people depend directly 
or indirectly on the 1312 km 
long river and its valley, with its 
fertile farmland, historic tem-
ples and pilgrimage routes.
World Bank withdrawal 
In 1986, a year after the World 
Bank lent $450 million to cons- 
truct Sardar Sarovar, NBA com- 
missioned a series of impact as-
sessment studies that, it claims, 
exposed crucial flaws in the of-
ficial cost-benefit analyses for 
the entire project. But at the 
heart of NBA’s campaign is the 
apparent lack of resettlement 
provision for oustees. With 
mounting international support, 
NBA was able to force a review 
of the Narmada project. In 1991 
the World Bank commissioned 
an independent inquiry, whose 
report essentially endorsed the 
NBA claims, saying that there 
had been “no proper appraisal” 
of the project’s impact. Two 
years later, in an unprecedent-
ed about-turn, the World Bank 
withdrew from the scheme.
 In 1994, India’s Supreme 
Court upheld a case presented by NBA, freezing all con-
struction on the Narmada dams until the state govern-
ments carried out adequate impact assessments. NBA 
insists that there must be no displacement if there are 
no realistic plans for resettlement. With the exception of 
Sardar Sarovar, none of the dam projects had any reset-
tlement plans, says the organization. NBA is adamant that 
it is not opposed to the development that the dams prom-
ise. It is also looking for a compromise solution, calling for 
the final height of the dams to be reduced. The lower the 
final height, the fewer people will be forced to move to 
make way for the reservoirs and the less land will be lost.
Although it now seems unlikely that NBA’s actions will stop 
the dams, the organization has brought the issue of resettle-
ment to the fore. In 1998 the Madhya Pradesh government 
set up a task force to look at resettlement possibilities. It 
found that not only was there no land in Madhya Pradesh to 
house oustees, but that the land promised by Gujarat either 
did not exist, or was of too poor quality. Madhya Pradesh 
has now called for a new evaluation. The state of Gujarat, how-
ever, has dug in its heels. Not only did it refuse to allow the in-
dependent World Commission 
on Dams, set up by the World 
Bank, to visit the Sardar Sarovar 
site, it also challenged the Su-
preme Court’s earlier ruling. In 
February 1999, after a four-year 
moratorium, the Supreme Court 
reversed its earlier decision, al-
lowing construction to begin 
again at Sardar Sarovar, adding 
a further 5 metres to the 80 me-
tres already built. 
Rally in the valley
NBA has now reinforced its 
struggle, organizing a series 
of passive sit-ins and hunger 
strikes. At the end of July last 
year Arundhati Roy organized 
a ‘Rally in the Valley’, marching 
with 400 other public figures 
and supporters from village 
to village in the affected area. 
An estimated 10,000 oust-
ees joined the rally in the 
fertile Nimad region of Mad-
hya Pradesh, where the local 
farmers will lose their land if 
construction goes ahead. And 
when the monsoon rains be-
gan in August 1999, Medha 
Patkar and other NBA mem-
bers took up positions in the 
village of Domkhedi, refusing 
to move as the flood waters 
rose up to their shoulders. Po-
lice in boats finally removed 
them. At the end of last year, 
Arundhati Roy published a 
closely documented essay en-
titled ‘The Greater Common 
Good’ in Outlook magazine, 
criticizing the Narmada Valley 
project both in principle and in its application.
As the mud flies between NBA and supporters of the proj-
ect, the withdrawal of the World Bank could have unpre-
dictable effects in the longer term. With most international 
aid programmes now unwilling to be associated with the dams, 
the developers are looking for private sector funding. This could 
be much harder to influence than an institution such as the 
World Bank, which has a ‘worthy’ image to protect.

Project tiger            
       by Rahul Singh
In 1989, Rahul Singh was editor-in-chief of The Sunday Observer, 
India’s largest Sunday newspaper, published in Bombay and Delhi. 
 tiger in its natural habitat is one of Nature’s most marvel-
lous and unforgettable sights. Around three metres long and 
weighing about 230 kilos, the adult animal with its beautifully 
coloured coat of golden-orange and black stripes is swift, 
ferocious and powerful, yet languid and graceful in its move-
ments. It is an unmatched hunting machine. No other animal 
arouses such fear, excitement and awe; no other animal is 
surrounded with such an air of mystery. 
The tiger, which is afraid of no wild creature, has one mor-
tal enemy – man, who can not only destroy this magnificent 
animal with guns, poison and traps but can also destroy its 
surroundings with axe and chain-saw. 
Half a century ago, there were at least 60,000 tigers in Asia. 
In Indonesia, the last known tiger was killed just before the 
Second World War and the Caspian tiger followed it into 
oblivion three decades later. (Attempts are now being made 
to re-introduce the tiger to these areas.)
India has become the tiger’s last major haunt in Asia, but 
here too the species has been devastated on a monumental 
scale. At the turn of the century there were 40,000 tigers in 
India. By 1972 there were just 2000 left. For the maharajahs 
of India, with their lavish privy purses, tiger shooting was a 
status symbol. One maharajah proudly claimed to have shot 
1150 tigers during his lifetime. Bags of 500 were quite com-
monplace. 
But even the abolition of the princely order did not improve 
matters. Poachers moved in for the valuable tiger skins, which 
two decades ago were worth $4000 each. Meanwhile, In-
dia’s population explosion from 450 million at independence 
in 1947 to over 800 million today meant that people moved 
inexorably into the tiger’s habitat. 
Forests, particularly in the Terai region bordering India and 
Nepal, were cut down to provide land for foodcrops. Its cover 
and that of its prey destroyed, the tiger disappeared from 
many parts of India where it had earlier flourished in large 
numbers. In other areas tigers retreated further and further 
into such forests as were left, often killing domestic cattle in 
their desperate hunger. By the time alarm bells started to ring 
in the late 1960s, the tiger was on the verge of extinction in 
India. 
The 1969 world congress of the International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), held 
in New Delhi, signalled an important turning point. The IUCN 
put the tiger on its list of endangered species and called for 
a ban on tiger hunting worldwide, to which India quickly re-
acted by forbidding tiger-shoots. On 1 April 1973, an am-
bitious ‘Project Tiger’ was officially launched by the Indian 
Government in Corbett National Part (Uttar Pradesh), named 
after the legendary British hunter-turned-conservationist, Jim 
Corbett. Eight tiger reserves were initially created as part of 
Project Tiger, to which the World Wildlife Fund donated $1 
million. 
According to Bittu Sehgal, the founder-editor of India’s 
leading wildlife magazine, Sanctuary, the idea behind Project 
Tiger is basically very simple. “Each reserve is demarcated 
into a core zone and a buffer zone. In the core, no human 
activity other than forest protection is allowed; here Nature 
is allowed to administer itself. In the buffer, human activity is

A
minimized, restricted to the exploitation of ‘minor’ forest pro-
duce such as grass, fruit, seeds, honey and fallen wood. The 
logic is that the core area, left to its own devices, will quickly 
become super-productive and that this productivity will spill 
over to the buffer zone.”
The results of the new strategy were extremely encouraging. 
Slowly but surely, the tiger started to make a comeback in 
India. At Corbett Park, there were only 44 tigers left sixteen 
years ago; today there are nearly 100. At Ranthambhor, a 
forest once owned by the Maharajah of Jaipur and protected 
mainly for tiger hunting, the number of tigers remaining at the 
start of Project Tiger has increased from fourteen to forty. 
Thanks to Project Tiger, the tiger has even made a remark-
able recovery in the Sundarbans, the 10,000-square-kilome-
tre mangrove forest in India, where the Ganges, the Brah-
maputra and the Meghna flow into the Bay of Bengal. Here, 
in one of the world’s largest tracts of mangroves, an area 
where the ecosystem was seriously threatened, more and 
more woodcutters, fishermen and honey-gatherers were be-
ing attacked by tigers, who, in the process of evolution, have 
become excellent swimmers and whose diet now includes 
fish. 
In 1973 Project Tiger was launched over an area of 2500 
square kilometres of the Sundarbans. At first, the authorities 
tried to exclude people entirely from the core reserve, but this 
proved impractical, and fishermen and honey-gatherers con-
tinued to go there despite the risks. So, in 1981, a new strat-
egy was devised. Electrified human dummies were placed 
at selected points in order to condition the tigers to fear 
man. When the tigers attacked the dummies, they received a 
shock, powerful enough to cause them pain. 
The ploy seems to have worked. Since then, the number of 
people killed by the tigers has dropped considerably. At the 
same time, since the inner core has been protected, honey 
collection and fish harvesting have increased by 300 per 
cent in fifteen years. 
As Sehgal says, Project Tiger is concerned not only with 
saving the tiger, but with ecology, the environment, and “sav-
ing mankind itself”. Today, the number of tigers in India has 
risen to 4000 and, in the process, other creatures that were 
on the verge of extinction in India, such as the elephant, the 
stag, the one-horned rhino and the wild buffalo, have been 
given a new lease of life. 
Above all, the Indian public is now far more aware of how 
man’s future on this planet is closely linked with Nature. 
Deforestation has certainly threatened the tiger, but it has 
also been a cause of the floods that recently ravaged much 
of north and eastern India. The connection would not have 
been made 20 years ago, but it is being made now. That is a 
step in the right direction.

Off the beaten path, Nokrek gained 
international recognition in May 2009. 
Along with two other Indian biosphere 
reserves – Pachmarhi in the central 
Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, and 
Similipal, in the eastern state of Orissa 
– Nokrek is among the 22 new sites re-
cently added by UNESCO to its World 
Network of Biosphere Reserves. Their 
inclusion raises the number of Indian 
sites on the World List to seven, from a 
total of 15 Biosphere Reserves across 
the subcontinent. 
The new status is expected to have 
a huge impact on the conservation and 
monitoring of these reserves to find the 
right balance between economic and 
human development. 
The challenge for all three Indian Bio-
sphere Reserves is to achieve a bal-
ance between human activity and envi-
ronmental protection. This is precisely 
the main challenge of UNESCO’s Man

the area,” said Vinod K. Nautiyal, principal

cover how people living in the area can 
improve their quality of life and enhance 
the superb natural environment.” 
The state forest chief points out that 
guidance from international experts 
would greatly benefit Nokrek. He hopes 
the new designation will contribute to 
the research and documentation of 
landscapes, ecosystems, species and 
genetic variations, besides complement-
ing conservation and sustainable devel-
opment strategies already in place. 
The Botanical Survey of India has re-
vealed that 10% of plants in Nokrek are 
rare or endangered. Scientists fear that 
increasing human intervention around 
the area designated as the gene sanc-
tuary is affecting the habitat’s natural 
balance. Large-scale deforestation and 
shifting cultivation have led to soil ero-
sion, and the selective cultivation of 
commercially profitable citrus varieties in 
areas close to the reserve also threatens 
genetic diversity. 
Spanning an area of 47.48 square kilo-
metres, Nokrek’s core zone is an impor-
tant source of many perennial rivers and 
streams, including the Simsang, Ganol, 
Bugi, Dareng and Rongdik rivers. One 
of the biggest tourist attractions in the 
area is the Siju Cave, located on a cliff 
overhanging the right bank of the Sim-
sang River. Locally known as Dobakhol 
or the cave of bats, it is the third-longest 
cave in India, and consists of innumer-
able internal chambers and labyrinths 
which have yet to be fully explored.
Pachmarhi, botanical  
and religious sanctuary
Located in the heart of India, the 
Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve encom-
passes three wildlife parks – Bori, Sat-
pura, and Pachmarhi. It also includes 
the Satpura Tiger Reserve at its core, 
and the picturesque hill-station of 
Pachmarhi, established by the British 
as a regional army headquarters. 
With cascading waterfalls, ravines 
and gorges sculpted into the red sand-
stone earth, and dense evergreen sal 
and teak forests interspersed with wild 
bamboo groves, Pachmarhi is a veritable 
paradise for botanists and geologists. 
Pachmarhi is also an archaeological trea-
sure house, with rock paintings in cave 
shelters, some of which are estimated 
to be 10,000 years old. Pachmarhi also 
has cultural and religious significance for 
Hindu pilgrims who throng here in large 
numbers every year to celebrate two im-
portant Hindu festivals, Maha Shivratri (in 
March) and Nagpanchmi (in July-August). 
Pachmarhi boasts seven distinct forest 
types, including tropical, moist and dry as 
well as sub-tropical hill forests. A mon-
soon climate, with three distinct seasons, 
ensures a rich and luxurious vegetation. 
Perennial streams and dark shady gorges 
encourage the growth of moisture-loving 
species such as ferns, orchids and rare 
herbs. As many as 71 species of ferns 
and fern allies, and 1190 species of an-
giosperms (flowering plants) have been 
documented. 
Satkoshia Reserve Forests, covering a 
total area of 5500 square kilometres. 
Sustained protection measures and 
management initiatives under the In-
dian government’s ‘Project Tiger’ pro-
gramme have resurrected the dwindling 
population of tigers in the Similipal Tiger 
Reserve, which accounts for nearly half 
the tiger population in Orissa state, on 
India’s east coast. 
Named after the silk cotton trees that 
bloom here, Similipal is a living labora-
tory for environmental scientists. Its 
ecosystems include lush forests, grass-
lands and wetlands, which are inhab-
ited by elephants, panthers, four-horned 
antelopes, giant squirrels and mugger 
crocodiles, besides being the abode of 
tigers, including the rare black and mela-
nistic tigers. It houses 94 species of 
orchids and over 3000 species of other 
plants. 
The tribal inhabitants, who account for 
73 per cent of the total population of 
about 450,000, depend on agriculture, 
hunting and collection of forest products 
for their livelihoods, but need additional 
sources of income. With 75 tribal vil-
lages located inside the tiger reserve, 
and the human population and livestock 
living in close proximity with wildlife, it 
is little wonder that forest officials are 
constantly challenged by man-animal 
conflicts. 
“Our biggest challenge is to protect the 
traditional rights of the forest dwellers, 
while conserving wildlife,” said R. Naga-
raja Reddy, Orissa’s Chief Conservator 
of Forests and Director of the Similipal 
Biosphere Reserve. “The inclusion of 
Similipal in the World Network will lead 
to meaningful exchanges of information, 
experience and personnel. It will also 
considerably help the research of eco-
systems, as well as monitoring and train-
ing work.” 
Besides providing advice, Reddy 
hopes the new designation will “bring 
funding from UNESCO through seed 
funds which could initiate local efforts, 
help broker local projects, and establish 
durable financial mechanisms.” 
For Belinda Wright, Executive Director 
of the Wildlife Protection Society of In-
dia, “The benefits for the sites of joining 
the World Network are largely political. 
With world recognition, the state govern-
ments of Orissa and Madhya Pradesh 
will focus more attention on the protec-
tion and management of these two tiger 
reserves, and this in turn should help 
improve their conditions.”

Pachmarhi’s dense forest vegetation 
provides an ideal habitat for wild animals, 
including panthers, wild boar, barking

besides tigers. The area is home to over 
50 species of mammal, 254 species of 
birds, 30 species of reptiles, and 50 spe-
cies of butterflies. 
The reserve, with a total area of 4926

of income. Poaching, deforestation and 
man-animal conflicts remain the reserve’s 
greatest problems.

Rajendra Pachauri   
                          talks to Jasmina Šopova
The Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, which you 
chair, has been awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize. Could this 
be seen as a sign of change  
in the world’s attitude towards 
global warming?
Indeed, the award of the Nobel Peace 
Prize to the IPCC and Mr. Al Gore is an 
important statement on what the Norwe-
gian Nobel Committee sees as a danger 
to peace arising out of unmitigated climate 
change. Since the Nobel Peace Prize and 
the significance attached to it get a great 
deal of attention and coverage worldwide, 
hopefully people’s attitude towards this is-
sue will be affected as a result. 
What are the impacts  
of climate change on peace? 
The impacts of climate change on peace 
can be numerous: first, the availability of 
water is decreasing, water resources 
are under high stress in several parts of 
the world. Second, extreme events such 
as heat waves, floods, droughts and ex-
treme precipitation, coastal flooding as a 
result of sea level rise, can lead to popu-
lation movements on a sizeable scale. 
The migration of large numbers of people 
can have an impact on peace, since the 
locations where such people move to 
may find this to be an unacceptable im-
position. Finally, the impacts of climate 
change on agriculture could also lead 
to large scale malnutrition, hunger and 
deprivation, which could end in conflict 
within communities and further move-
ment of large numbers away from areas 
where food is scarce.
In your Nobel lecture,  
you highlight that scholars  
do not pay enough attention 
to the inequities arising from 
these changes, although  
they are part of the most  
significant aspects  
of the impacts of climate 
change. Could you develop  
this idea? 
Scholars have not paid adequate atten-
tion to the equity implications of climate 
change because thus far research has 
largely focused on the physical science 
aspects of climate change, the vulner-
ability aspects as well as on the options 
for mitigation. Now, however, there is 
growing awareness about equity as an 
ethical issue related to climate change. 
You head The Energy and  
Resource Institute which  
developed a germ that breaks 
down petrol. Can you explain 
how it works and what  
the results are? 
We have a major biotechnology pro-
gramme in The Energy and Resources 
Institute, and some of our work has re-
sulted in the development of microbes 
that consume petroleum products. This 
technology is being used now quite ex-
tensively for cleaning up oil spills and oil 
sludge deposits. Once the oil has been 
completely eaten up, the microbes per-
ish without any environmental effects. 
You subscribe to the  
philosophy of Vasudhaiva  
Kutumbakam, which means  
the whole universe is one  
family. What is the role  
of Indian traditional culture  
in your work? 
It is difficult for me to identify what role 
Indian tradition and culture play in my 
work, but having been brought up in 
this country and holding Indian tradi-
tion in great respect, I suppose every-
thing I do is influenced by my upbring-
ing and beliefs.
You believe that each one of us 
can do something for a better 
and safer world. What advice 
would you give our readers?
Each one of us can do a great deal to 
make this world better and safer. First, 
we must develop a belief in the need for 
protecting the environment. We must also 
realize the danger of treating Mother Na-
ture with disrespect and of damaging the 
earth’s ecosystems and natural resources. 
We could then find ways to minimize our 
footprint on the earth’s natural resources 
and ecosystems. This would involve sim-
ple things like switching off lights when 
we leave the room, using efficient energy 
consuming devices, using energy effi-
cient transport such as public transport, 
promoting the use of renewable forms of 
energy… We can bring about a lifestyle 
change in which we reduce reusing and 
recycling products that we have become 
accustomed to. Technology will also bring 
about change towards lowering the inten-
sity of natural resource use, which in turn 
should be supported by policies. But life-
style changes are important too.

Climate change endangers peace,

Scenes from  
everyday life

amil people today have a way of life that carries them back 
and forth over twenty centuries. When a young Tamil with a 
doctorate in atomic science from a famous American univer-
sity advertises for a bride in the matrimonial columns of a Ma-
dras English-language daily, he mentions his caste and sub-
caste and asks a suitable girl with the height and waistline he 
desires to write to him immediately – enclosing a horoscope. 
And since computers are now used for casting horoscopes 
there need be no delay. 
On the day of Ayudha Pooja, the annual festival at which 
craftsmen honour the tools of their trade, surgeons who per-
form open-heart surgery will put a kumkumam mark on their 
minute, high-precision equipment.
Village, town, city: each has its own pace and style of life. 
Morning begins much earlier in the cities and villages than in 
the small towns. In the villages this is a natural and in the cities 
an enforced inconvenience. 
In the cities a generation may still survive which remembers 
the sound – that wonderful sound – of milk squirting into 
empty metal pots from the teats of cows and buffaloes. The 
milk sound, the sound of cow bells, the sound of hoofs, the 
rattle of horns, the rustle of straw, the clatter of milk cans on 
the ground – the only sound like these in the cities today is 
that of bicycle bells. In the city milk is left on the doorstep in 
plastic sachets, and the customer does not even see the face 
of the girl who delivers it. Alas, the alarm has been set too 
late for that. Beside the milk is the morning newspaper, and 
soon the odour of coffee and news will be in the air. While 
reading his newspaper and drinking his coffee, the prudent 
householder will remember to turn on the tap and fill his pots 
and pans with water. The water supply may continue to flow 
all day... but then again it may not. 
In the city as in the village, the first thing the housewife should 
do when she has taken her morning bath is to draw the tra-
ditional kolam sign in front of her door. I still remember forty 
years later how my grandmother once accusingly pointed out 
to her daughter-in-law that, although it was already noon, she 
had still not drawn the kolam. (In fact the sun had only just 
risen). In those days the kolam was drawn with rice flour; to-
day it is traced with white lime powder. Over the years it has 
become accepted that a housewife can draw the kolam after 
merely washing her face, provided that she has applied the 
kumkumam and arranged her hair above her forehead. 
Methods of cooking have changed. There has been a real 
revolution in the kitchen. Yesterday gas stoves, electric grind-
ers, pressure-cookers, hot-plates and refrigerators were pos-
sessions of the rich; today middle-class people aspire to have 
them. Working housewives are discovering time-saving strat-

egies in the kitchen. The menfolk and the children will have to 
learn to do their bit in the morning hustle and bustle. 
From eight o’clock in the morning onwards the sparrows 
start to fly away from every home. First the little sparrows, 
then the big sparrows. Then the house suddenly subsides 
into a great calm. Now, if anybody rings the doorbell, the door 
will usually be kept firmly shut. Even if it is opened, it will only 
be to a width of four fingers, and an elderly face, frightened by 
the sound of its own non-committal reply, will close the door 
upon itself. 
Crowded buses and trains. Even if a seat is vacant, tradition 
still requires that a woman should not sit beside a man, nor man 
beside a woman. While boarding, however, men and women 
inevitably jostle one another in the crush. They are bound to 
bump into one another while standing or moving down to aisle. 
But for the time being they have decided not to sit side by 
side. Some humorous conductors crack jokes and make the 
passengers laugh, helping to dispel the nervousness that has 
been rising into the mind like poison ever since daybreak. 
The evenings are starting to belong to the television, which the 
middle class has welcomed with open arms. For all practical 
purposes the television is simply the cinema that has entered 
the home; films that have already been seen at the cinema get 
a second showing in the drawing room. Groups of children 
from neighbouring families are sitting on the floor in front of the 
set. They know what is going to happen next on the screen, 
and shout out the emotion-packed dialogue being breathlessly 
delivered by hero or heroine, delighted to beat the actors to 
the end of each sentence. Not that television has depleted the 
cinema audiences; even for midday shows long queues can 
be seen waiting outside the cinemas in the scorching sun. 
Women attend the free meetings held by religious preach-
ers. When these erudite religious scholars intersperse epic 
stories with examples of behaviour drawn from everyday life, 
from the cinema, and from politics in order to show how the 
ancient virtues have fallen into neglect, the people in the au-
dience can find tearful consolation in relating the trials and 
tribulations of their own lives to the general decline in values. 
The men, and more so the women, also flock to the plays put 
on by the Sabha, local cultural associations. They rock with 
laughter at the crackling jokes, secretly weep with the heroine 
when she bewails the sorrows besetting her, and share her 
joy when her problems disappear like mist driven away by the 
sunshine. Then they return home, glad to have found an outlet 
for their mental tensions. 
For those who do not want to go out or who cannot afford 
to do so, there are the weekly and monthly magazines to be 
read. These magazines contain adventure stories, love sto-
ries with a social or historical background told with bubbling 
enthusiasm and ending with a strong insistence on the moral 
virtues, titbits of information, revelations about politicians and 
film stars, as well as light poetry and essays. Tamils who do 
not feel some mental bond with these magazines or who do 
not glance at them at least once a day are few are far be-
tween. 
Sunday is a wonderful day. Sunday mornings are for routine 
jobs and the afternoons for more spiritual satisfaction. Piles of 
clothes must be mended, washed, ironed and put away. The 
bank must be visited (banks are open on Sundays in residen-
tial areas). Certain skills must be brought into play to obtain 
from ration-shops slightly higher quantities of scarce grains, 
low-fat vegetable oils (sought-after not because of their low 
cholesterol but because of their low price), sugar and/or ker-
osene. Grain must be pounded and ground. Then, after ap-

plying oil to the head, it is time for a leisurely bath with careful 
rinsing of the hair, followed by a siesta to squeeze out the last 
drop of body fatigue. In the afternoon, a film or a trip to the 
beach or to a friend’s house. And so on and so forth… When 
Sunday dawns there are so many plans and projects nagging 
at the mind. If you listen to the voice of physical fatigue that 
says “Not today, not today”, and you stay in bed, then the fam-
ily is done for. Even if you get up briskly and chase after time’s 
fleeting chariot and rush through your chores, time’s chariot 
somehow manages to keep ahead and when it disappears 
into darkness not even a quarter of the work is done. Every 
theatre companies have become very common. Electricity 
has brought lighting. It has also brought the blare of loud-
speakers. Simple make-up accessories and new kinds of 
dresses are finding a place in village life. The villagers are 
obsessed by films and politics, even though their lives are not 
dependent on them. In the little shops, at the hairdresser’s, 
and under the trees, people gather and discuss the cinema 
and politics. The two fields are not unrelated. Yesterday’s 
film personalities are today active in politics. Today’s cinema 
people may go into politics at any moment.

Sunday it is like this. You think back and remember the care-
less mistakes you have made, the things you have forgotten 
to do. Next Sunday you must try even harder. 
The gap between cities and villages has narrowed. Efficient 
and steady improving road transport is helping to bring peo-
ple together. The expanding city suburbs are reaching out to 
the villages. 
The village revolves around agriculture. It is very early in the 
morning when the men and women of the village set out to 
work in the fields or gardens. There is no time to prepare 
breakfast, nor any modern time-saving kitchen equipment. If 
there are any left-overs from the previous night’s food the vil-
lagers swallow a mouthful before they leave. It is becoming 
a custom to drink a cup of tea on the way to work. In the vil-
lages few parents devote much time or trouble to getting their 
children off to school; the children must fend for themselves. 
Changing fashions are also reaching the villages. Touring 
lages has completely disappeared. Time once went by at 
snail’s pace; now it has started to walk; but it does not yet 
run. Leisurely conversation can still be heard on the thinnai, 
the verandahs of the houses. In rivers and ponds women take 
their time to bathe. Women still carry pots of drinking water 
on their hips. The harmony that once existed everywhere be-
tween men and other living creatures continues to exist in the 
villages. There are cows, buffaloes, chickens and dogs. The 
grinding mills still turn in the homes, the pestle still rotates 
in the mortar. Healthy women still pound paddy with heavy 
pounding rods. Boiled paddy is spread outside in the street 
in front of the door. 
The sun still rises over the village. Leave the house, walk 
across the fields, look to the far horizon and feel the mountain 
breeze like the soft touch of children.

India:  
Cycles of Birth and Rebirth      
   by A.S. Gnanasambandan
nce up on a time a snarling dog was standing outside an 
Indian temple. Another dog came up to him and asked why 
he was so angry. The first dog replied: “I was a priest in this 
temple in my previous birth. The trustee of the temple, a power-
ful man, goaded me into becoming his accomplice in the theft 
of the jewellery of the goddess of the temple, and as a result I 
am now born as a dog. I am waiting to see that fellow. As soon 
I see him, I shall pounce on him and tear out his throat. The 
second dog said: “Please don’t do that. I was that trustee in 
my previous birth.”
This story and others like it were often told by Indian sages to 
illustrate the belief, common to all schools of Indian philosophy, 
that life is a cycle of births and rebirths. After their death, hu-
man beings are reborn into this world in various forms; all of 
them have passed through several earlier births and will pass 
through several future births. What they think and do in this life 
will determine the form (human, animal, insect, etc.) in which

they will live their next life, as set forth in the doctrine of Karma 
(action) and rebirth. “Accordingly as one acts, accordingly as 
one behaves, so does one become in the next life,” says the an-
cient treatise known as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. “The 
doer of good becomes good, the doer of evil becomes evil. 
One becomes virtuous by virtuous action, bad by bad action.”
What happens to the soul after death and before rebirth? 
Each school of Indian philosophy has its own answer to this 
question, although they all agree that there is a celestial world 
and that those who do right things and live a godly life go to 
it and enjoy its benefits while awaiting their return to the ter-
restrial world.

50 l The UNESCO Courier - Special Issue November 2009
Because there are differences in the amount and quality of 
good and evil that people do, the upper world is divided into 
seven regions or lokas; the underworld where evildoers go is 
also divided into regions. The doers of good go to one of the 
seven different upper worlds depending on the quality and 
quantity of the good they do. The lowest upper world, for 
example, is reached by those who do good and lead a pious 
life, performing the prescribed rituals to propitiate the gods, 
but do not control their senses and mind. To go to a higher 
upper world one must control one’s sense and one’s mind, 
and as far as possible one’s inner mind also. 
Only a human being can achieve emancipation (moksha) 
from the cycle of birth and death. This fate is reserved for the 
amount of desire – even desire for emancipation – remains 
in his mind. 
“Eradicate desire,” wrote the southern sage Tirumoolar. 
“Eradicate it even if the desire is to attain the lotus feet of 
the Lord.
The more you desire the greater will be your suffering.”
Some believe that the life which goes out of the body has 
a form, the sukshma sarira or astral body, with which we 
accede to the upper world or lower world according to the 
good or bad that we have done in this one. Another belief 
is that a dying person’s last thought gives an indication as 
to their next birth. This is why Indian philosophy stresses 
that you should go to bed with pure thoughts, repeating 
select few (jnanis or yogis) who are unaffected by worldly 
things or by the pairs of opposites (dwandas) such as suf-
fering and happiness. According to the Bhagavad Gita: “The 
serene one absorbed in the Atman [eternal self] masters 
his will, He knows no disquiet in heat or in cold, In pain of 
pleasure, In honour, or dishonour.” Only someone who tran-
scends the pairs of opposites attains the lotus feet of the 
Lord. 
Even if a person’s soul reaches the seventh upper world 
it is still not entitled to achieve emancipation if a very small 
the name of the Lord. If you die in your sleep, the purity of 
your last thought will ennoble your soul through the next birth 
which will certainly be into a higher spiritual life.
How far have these philosophical tenets and beliefs been 
practised in society? Traditional Indian society was broadly 
divided into a minority of intellectuals and philosophers and 
a majority which fully accepted their teachings about the cy-
cle of birth and death. Even today, illiterate villagers say that 
someone who harms another person will be born as a street 
dog in his next birth.

The doctrine of Karma and rebirth has long influenced 
people to do what would lead them to a good afterlife. It 
might be said that they were motivated by a foolish fear of 
the other world, which may or may not exist. But what about 
the postulates of modern science regarding the atom, elec-
tromagnetic force and energy, which cannot be perceived 
by our senses, but whose existence we accept because we 
can see the results of their actions?
There is however one big difference between the findings 
of modern science and the Indian “life chain” philosophy. The 
Darwinian theory of evolution postulates that life can only 
evolve upwards, whereas according to Indian philosophy, 
those who have reached a very high spiritual level can come 
However, as the centuries went by, an intellectual hierarchy 
began to rule society and its members realized that they could 
use the doctrine of Karma and rebirth as a weapon to sub-
jugate the majority and thereby perpetuate their power. The 
caste system came to be twisted into an inegalitarian hi-
erarchy based on birth. The higher castes in the hierarchy 
were meant to serve them. Since the majority of the lower 
rank were deliberately left without education and intellec-
tual pursuits they had to accept this inegalitarian structure 
based on birth, which determined what work they should 
do in this world. 
So, for many centuries, the theory of a chain of birth and 
rebirth helped perpetuate the inequalities and injustices of

down in the next birth to the lowest level if they commit an 
action in a fit of emotion or anger. There is no guarantee that 
people will always rise from one birth to the next. Their next 
birth is decided by their thoughts and actions in the previous 
one and by the Karma that they have already accumulated. 
This deeply rooted faith in the life chain has shaped Indian 
society from time immemorial. As an explanation of why some 
are more talented and enjoy higher social status that others, 
and why some suffer while others enjoy good fortune in this 
life, it led people to accept what was inevitable and at the 
same time enjoy peace of mind. When people feel that they 
alone are the cause of the good and evil which befall them, 
they do not try to blame others for their situation. In the words 
of a Tamil poem written in the third century B.C.: “All places in 
the world are ours, all human beings are our kinsmen; good 
and bad which befall us are not inflicted by others.”
the caste system based on birth. Saint Tiruvalluvar’s dictum 
that all souls are born equal in this world could not exert 
much sway over the majority of people because they were 
denied the capacity to read it and understand it.
It is hard to know how far modern Indians believe in the doc-
trine of Karma and rebirth and how much they think about it. 
Modern Indian society is a competitive society in which the 
pursuit of wealth is accompanied by many pressures and 
evils. And yet the majority of people still have a wonderful way 
of keeping their peace of mind. Of someone who acquires 
wealth by wrongdoing they are inclined to say peacefully: “Let 
him earn, he is not going to carry anything he acquires now 
into his next birth. He has to go empty-handed.”

Class, caste 
and power
     by Ambalal Somabhai Patel
he basic cause of poverty in developing countries is usually 
considered to be the economic backwardness or stagnation 
of the rural areas where the vast majority of the population 
live. In India the main occupation of these rural people is ag-
riculture, which contributes almost 40% to the net domestic 
product. Yet the income of agricultural workers is substan-
tially below the national average, and is often almost at sub-
sistence level.
There are a number of reasons for this, notably:
• the unviable size of land holdings (still decreasing as a 
result of the system of dividing property among many);
• lack of irrigation facilities, so that farmers are dependent 
on rainfall and the vagaries of nature;
• lack of sufficient financial resource to invest in seeds, ma-
nure or equipment, or to pay seasonal labour costs;
• lack of satisfactory administrative machinery, such as co-
operatives, to organize the purchase and resale of agricul-
tural produce; 
• lack of transport facilities and a good road network to en-
sure rapid distribution of fresh vegetables and fruit;
• inadequate knowledge of farming, farm products and sea-
sonal crops, through non-utilization of available facilities such 
as further education programmes.
The productivity of small farms is generally low, resulting in 
very poor returns on labour input and capital investment. The 
plight of small farmers and unskilled agricultural labourers is 
made worse by the fact that they are ill-equipped for alter-
native employment in related sectors which could provide a 
source of income during the slack season. 
While economic stagnation results from external factors that 
can be altered by determined implementation of appropriate 
development policies and programmes, there are other so-
cial or sociological factors, which are deeply rooted in tradition 
and are woven into the fabric of Indian society. Big efforts by the 
education system and media are needed to overcome these ob-
stacles, which arise from caste distinctions and religious beliefs. 
The rigid hierarchy of the caste system and the specific functions 
assigned to each caste since ancient times, underpinned by re-
ligious injunctions, provide little scope for upward mobility. Rural 
people are also more conservative and traditional in their outlook 
and believe so strongly in religious practises, social customs and 
superstitions that they resist attempts to change social behaviour 
and attitudes. The weight of past traditions, customs and values 
acts as a brake on economic development and the rapid elimina-
tion of poverty. 
Another social mechanism, exploitation, is a natural conse-
quence of the class, caste and power systems, and plays an 
important role in perpetuating economic, social and political in-
equalities. The rich exploit the poor in subtle ways, of which the 
latter may be unaware; employers exploit employees; engineers 
exploit contractors or builders; the upper classes or castes ex-
ploit the lower; school administrators exploit teachers; teachers 
exploit students (although sometimes the reverse is the case); 
doctors and lawyers exploit patients and clients; intellectuals ex-
ploit non-intellectuals and create problems of student unrest.
Among other factors which affect the economic well-being of a 
society are family composition and size, which influence not only 
the intellectual and personal characteristics of family members, 
but also affect the family’s financial status and the benefits de-
rived from it. Two families differing in size and age structure may 
derive very different benefits from an equal total income. On the 
other hand, two families of equal size may have unequal earn-
ing capacities because of differences in age, sex, intellectual and 
personality traits, social or job status, or the number of aged, in-
firm or young family members. 
Since the poor are usually unemployed, unemployment is often 
regarded as a cause of poverty. It should rather be seen as a 
contributing factor, or as a consequence of other variables which 
may co-exist with poverty. 
Demographic factors have been raised in discussions of poverty 
because the population parameter appears in the measurements 
of wealth in terms of per capita national income. One conclusion 
drawn from this is that, in order to reduce poverty, the numerator 
(national income) should increase, while the denominator (popu-
lation size) should be reduced. At one time the population factor 
was relegated to the background – Karl Marx, for example, saw 
no link between demographic growth and poverty and held the 
capitalist system entirely responsible for the latter. In the 1950s 
and 1960s many developing countries experienced a population 
explosion as the result of a rapid decline in mortality rates unac-
companied by a corresponding fall in the birth rate. This again 
brought the population factor to the forefront. However, to imply 
that rapid population growth is the cause or even one of the main 
causes of the problem of poverty is clearly an oversimplification 
of the problem.

Tea cultivation is a vital industry in the region of Assam. In the 1970s small

Cultivation on small farms increased during the 1990s and today accounts  
for over 10% of the tea produced in Assam.

India’s ‘Hidden Apartheid’
 by Gopal Guru, with Shiraz Sidhva
Gopal Guru is a professor of social and political theory  
in the Center of Political Science at Jawaharlal Nehru University.  
In 2001, Shiraz Sidhva was a UNESCO Courier journalist.
or centuries, the untouchables of Paliyad, a nondescript vil-
lage in western India’s Ahmedabad district, have known their 
place. Many of them are manual scavengers, cleaning the toilets 
of upper-caste villagers or toiling the land, sometimes for less 
than a handful of rice a day. 
“We’ve known that we must stay away from them [upper-caste 
people] since the day we were born,” says Rajesh, who is going 
on 19. “At the tea stalls, we have separate cups to drink from, 
chipped and caked with dirt, and we’re expected to clean them 
ourselves. We have to walk for 15 minutes to carry water to our 
homes, because we’re not allowed to use the taps in the vil-
lage that the upper castes use. We’re not allowed into temples, 
and when I attended school, my friends and I were forced to sit 
just outside the classroom […] the upper caste children would 
not allow us even to touch the football they played with […] we 
played with stones instead.” 
More than 160 million people, a sixth of India’s population, 
continue to bear the burden of a 2000-year old caste system 
sanctioned by Hindu theology, which locks people into a rigid 
role by virtue of their birth.
Codes to suit the upper class
Though the term ‘untouchables’ was abolished in 1950 under 
India’s constitution, the ‘oppressed people’ or Dalits as they are 
now referred to, continue to be discriminated against. They are 
denied access to land, forced to work in humiliating and degrad-
ing conditions and are routinely abused by the police and upper-
caste groups, which enjoy the state’s protection. 
Though India has sought to overcome the inequities of caste 
and discrimination through affirmative action — reserving quo-
tas in education, government jobs and political bodies — these 
policies have benefited only a few. The highest office in the land, 
that of the largely ceremonial President, is today held by a Dalit, 
K.R.Narayanan. But all the horrors of India’s caste system per-
sist at the grassroots; attempts to defy this rigid social order 
invariably result in violence or economic retaliation. 
Perhaps the world’s longest surviving social hierarchy, India’s 
caste system entails a complex ordering of social groups on the 
basis of ritual purity. Attributed to the law-giver Manu, the system 
was spelt out over 2000 years ago in the Dharma Shastra, the 
cornerstone of the Hindu religion. 
According to Manu, every individual is born into one of four 
principal varnas, or large categories, and must remain within that 
caste until death, although the particular ranking of that caste 
may vary among different regions in the country and over time. 
In order of precedence, the Brahmins are the priests and teach-
ers, presiding over knowledge and education; the Kshatriyas 
are the rulers and soldiers; the Vaishyas, merchants and trad-
ers; and the Shudras, the peasants, labourers and artisans. The 
untouchables fall into a fifth category outside the varna system, 
and were often assigned tasks too ‘ritually polluting’ to merit in-
clusion within the traditional varna system. 
Clearly, caste discrimination was an ideological construct that 
was deployed by the upper castes to create and maintain their 
monopoly over cultural capital (knowledge and education), so-
cial capital (status and patriarchal domination), political capital

ney general and a member of the UN Subcommission on 
Prevention of Discrimination. India, a vigorous campaigner 
against apartheid, claims that it has done everything pos-
sible to grant equality to India’s lowest castes. A fifth of 
the seats in parliament are reserved for members of the 
scheduled castes (the official term for Dalits), and some 
states are governed by powerful political parties based on 
alliances with the lower castes.
Campaigns to end the stigma
Quotas and job allocations, however, have not brought equality, 
dignity, or even safety for India’s ‘broken people’. In villages, the 
social stigma remains too strong to obliterate by laws alone.
Official figures speak for themselves: recorded crimes and 
atrocities against the lowest castes averaged 26,000 a year 
between 1997 and 1999 (the latest figures available). Con-
sidering the police are often reluctant even to record claims 
against the upper castes, these figures expose just the tip of 
the iceberg. 
About two-thirds of the Dalit population are illiterate, and 
about half are landless agricultural labourers. Only seven per-
cent have access to safe drinking water, electricity and toilets. 
And a majority of the estimated 40 million bonded labourers 
(who work as slaves to pay off debts), including 15 million chil-
dren, are Dalits. 
A national campaign to highlight abuses against Dalits was 
spearheaded by human rights groups in eight Indian states in 
1998, and caste has been taken up as an issue internation-
ally for the first time by organizations including Human Rights 
Watch. While some Dalits have resisted subjugation and dis-
crimination by armed struggle, these are invariably quelled by 
more powerful upper-caste private militia like the Ranbir Sena 
in Bihar, which has been held responsible for a series of mas-
sacres of poor Dalit peasants and landless labourers. 
Macwan agrees that including caste discrimination in the 
conference’s final resolutions would be only a symbolic vic-
tory, changing nothing in reality. “The only solution is to change 
people’s minds,” he declares.

(power), and material capital (wealth). The codes were often per-
nicious, and rules were bent to suit the upper castes. In northern 
India, for example, untouchables were forced to use drums to 
announce their arrival, and even their shadows were thought 
to be polluting. In the south, some Brahmins stipulated that the 
lower castes would have to maintain a distance of 65 feet (22 
metres) from them in order not to contaminate their betters. 
Yet this caste-based discrimination also had a pragmatic di-
mension. The untouchables, excluded from the education and 
books of the Brahmins, were nevertheless allowed to develop 
their own stores of knowledge, in agriculture or midwifery for 
example. But there was a catch — this knowledge was only al-
lowed because it benefited the upper castes. 
A case of racism?
Caste is still frequently used as a cover for exploitative eco-
nomic arrangements. Even today, most Dalits are not permitted 
to cross the invisible ‘pollution’ line that divides their part of the 
village from that occupied by the higher castes. And yet a Dalit 
woman, whose very shadow is polluting, is allowed to mas-
sage the body of the upper-caste woman she serves. Upper 
caste men, meanwhile, think nothing of raping Dalit women or 
consorting with lower-caste prostitutes, even though touching 
them by accident in the street is a sacrilege. 
One of the main reasons why the caste system has survived 
is because the hierarchical notion of social good it perpetu-
ates is legitimized by the lower castes themselves. They rep-
licate this hierarchy by imitating the cultural values of the up-
per castes, imposing discrimination on castes even lower than 
their own. Sociologists claim there are more than 2000 castes 
and sub-castes within the five categories. These are called 
jatis, endogamous (inter-marrying) groups that are divided 
along occupational, sectarian, regional and linguistic lines. 
Even as outcasts, the Dalits divide themselves into further 
castes. This proliferation allows for discrimination both hori-
zontally and vertically, thus making social relations all the more 
rigid and impermeable. 
The plight of India’s untouchables and the regular hu-
man rights abuses against them elicits short-lived public 
outrage, leaving the state under little pressure to engineer 
large-scale social change. This is why a coalition of Dalit 
groups and activists has lobbied 
hard for their plight to be on the 
agenda of the UN World Confer-
ence against Racism. 
“Caste is India’s hidden apart-
heid,” says Martin Macwan, 41, 
convenor of the National Campaign 
on Dalit Human Rights. He argues 
that like racism, caste discrimina-
tion is “based on descent.” 
Their demand has sparked off a 
national debate about the nature of 
caste discrimination and whether 
other countries should be allowed to 
interfere in what the Indian govern- 
ment considers “an internal mat-
ter.” 
The government has opposed the 
inclusion of caste on the UN con-
ference’s agenda on the grounds 
that caste and race are not synony-
mous. “Race and caste are distinct,” 
insists Soli Sorabjee, India’s attor- Transplanting rice in Tamil Nadu.

he democratic ideal has never been fully translated into prac-
tise. Many so-called democratic societies in the past were 
hijacked and became oligarchies in which democratic rhet-
oric was used to preserve the fiction that the ruling group 
represented the majority. The Greek city states, for example, 
are often cited as the first democracies, but it is convenient-
ly forgotten that, in them, slaves outnumbered free citizens 
and were neither represented nor had any rights. In the light 
of historical experience, how can democracy be adapted to 
the circumstances of the late twentieth century?
In modern times democracy has often been associated 
with the nation-state. But perhaps we should not overlook 
the experience of the smaller social and political unites 
which in the past have been run on quasi-democratic lines. 
Those who sought to endow the nation-state with an 
identity by associating it with the middle class or with a re-
gional, linguistic, ethnic or even religious group, claimed to 
be doing so in the name of democracy. Sometimes, it has 
been argued, these communities were fictitious and their 
ostensible identity camouflaged hidden aspirations. By 
equating the group’s identity with nationalism, national and 
democratic causes coalesced. But in these nation-states 
the functioning of democracy was limited by the national-
ism with which they were linked. Now that the nation-state 
is increasingly being questioned, should we also question 
democracy – or certain kinds of democracy?
One question that might be asked is whether democracy 
presupposes secularism. In many parts of the world, reli-
Romila thapar is professor emeritus of History at Jawaharlal Nehru  
University in New Delhi, and one of the world’s foremost experts 
of ancient Indian history. Her seminal work, ‘History of India, Vol.1’  
has been in print ever since it was first published in 1966. Dr. Thapar,  
who believes in interpreting ancient Indian texts in the light of new  
insights, has taught at top institutions including Oxford University, Cornell, 
the College de France in Paris, and the University of London.  
She has been involved in her country’s debates about historical truth,  
political identity and social reform.

gion is now being politically manipulated on an unprece-
dented scale. In saying this I am not objecting to people’s 
right to practise their faith, but to the way in which various 
politicians and fundamentalists have distorted this right. If 
questioning the public function of religion necessarily leads 
to secularism, then this could encourage the promotion of 
another approach to democracy, particularly in societies 
where several religions exist side by side. 
Democracy implies both representation and decisions 
based on the views of the majority. But what constitutes 
a majority? If it is simply a matter of the number of votes 
cast at elections, this opens the ways to vote-rigging or to 
the mobilization of mass support by ideologies that appear 
to espouse a variety of causes but in reality are no more 
than a mechanism for attracting and controlling large num-
bers of people. I am thinking here of the kind of reactionary 
populism based on race or religion that has time and again 
caused tensions and violence in many parts of the world, 
both North and South. In the interests of true democracy, it

would be worth considering how such movements can be 
prevented from imposing their definition of majority rule, es-
pecially when religious communities are exploited politically 
as part of a supra-national hidden agenda. 
The modern nation-state also faces the problem of ac-
commodating minority cultures, which are increasingly 
aware that they cannot be excluded from the democrat-
ic majority. This problem is likely to become especial-
ly acute in the industrialized countries, where sharply 
differing groups have forcibly been brought together 
through past colonial connections and present eco-
nomic needs, and where a numerical majority is some-
times reduced to the status of a political minority. In 
ex-colonies where such conflicts are also known, the 
divergent groups do, at least, normally share some com-
mon inheritance and history. 
The best way to understand the correlation between cul-
ture and democracy is to examine the manner in which in-
dividuals or groups choose their identity and perceive the 
difference between themselves and others. In part, this 
is the result of early socialization. It can also spring from 
tension and conflicts, which sharpen people’s perception 
of their identity. Why, incidentally, should the nation-state 
insist on a single identity? After all, individuals have mul-
tiple identities. The sterility of a single identity could be 
replaced by a multi-faceted one involving more complex 
social and cultural patterns. A multi-faceted democracy 
would also be more difficult to control politically. 
Representational democracy often ends up with power 
far removed from the individual citizen. Now that cine-
ma, television and advertising have all got into the act, 
would-be representatives of the people find themselves 
addressing audiences they cannot even see. True repre-
sentativity must be based on some reference back to the 
electors, who must also retain the right to recall their rep-
resentatives, if they so wish. These seemingly negative

rights can provide an essential corrective to the tendency of 
representatives to turn into power-brokers. 
The collapse of some socialist economies has led the peoples 
in the countries concerned to a desperate hope that the free 
market will protect them against the revival of totalitarian 
regimes. But the experience of other countries shows that 
the market cannot do this. Unfortunately, the market can 
equally well lend itself to other kinds of dictatorial demand 
– from consumerism, the armaments industry, multi-national 
corporations and other interests. Such demands, which un-
dermine equality of opportunity and social justice, can only 
be countered by an equitable economic system and a legal 
system that is accessible to all citizens and prevents the ero-
sion of human rights and the annulling of human dignity. 
However, any system can be thwarted, abused or rendered 
ineffective if those who control it cannot be challenged. In-
stitutions which are expected to act as watchdogs often end 
up by becoming a party to the abuses they are supposed to 
prevent. The articulation of dissent and protest is impera-
tive for democratic systems. Even in democratic societies, 
when children are taught their rights and duties, attention 
is rarely drawn to their right to disagree. Conformity is at 
a premium, and dissent is frowned upon or ignored. The 
submissive subject, rather than the autonomous individual, 
is regarded as the ideal citizen. 
In pleading the case of the autonomous individual, I am 
not advocating an anarchic society. Autonomous individu-
als do not set out to destroy society; they are concerned 
with changing it in creative ways. They do not necessarily 
form part of the power structure themselves, but they com-
ment on it and, if needs be, protest against specific actions 
taken by those in power. As long as it is accepted that 
there is room for moral authority as well as political and 
social authority in the running of society, such people will 
always have a place in the democratic process.

Ideology 
Clashing 
with History    
               Romila Thapar talks 
               to Shiraz Sidhva
You have strongly opposed the attempt to use 
history in support of an ideology of religious 
nationalism by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP), which was in power from 
1998 to 2004. There was an attempt at the time to 
rewrite Indian textbooks. How does the rewriting 
of history to endorse recent political ideology  
affect human rights? 
Let me clarify here that my fight was against the BJP-led 
government and the Hindutva view of Indian history, and not 
against other governments in India. The Hindutva lobby that 
insisted on the changes in Indian textbooks endorses a Hindu 
right-wing ultra-nationalism – often described as Hindu funda-
mentalism – and is trying to propagate a revisionist history in 
classrooms and political discourse. The parent organization in 
India, known as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has 
a distinctly religious fundamentalist political agenda. The RSS 
and its political arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), gained 
power defeating moderate secular Indians by exploiting Hindu 
nationalist sentiments. The RSS has been involved in several 
high-profile incidents of religiously motivated violence over the 
last twenty years. 
The controversy on my work involved some textbooks I had 
written for middle schools, where I had talked about the lives of 
Aryans as we knew it from the Vedic texts. I had mentioned, for 
instance, that the early Indians ate beef – the references in the 
“The best way to understand the correlation between culture and democracy 
is to examine the manner in which individuals or groups choose their identity  
and perceive the differences between themselves and others”.

Vedas are clear, and there is archaeological evidence for this. 
The Hindu right wing extolled the Aryans as the great model 
society for ancient India, and were opposed to any criticism 
of them. When they objected to this and other statements of 
mine, I provided evidence from the texts as proof. But they 
insisted that children should not be told that beef was eaten in 
early times. My reaction was that it was historically more cor-
rect to explain to school children why in early times beef was 
eaten, and why later a prohibition was introduced. 
Though the attack on me was vicious, I was not the only his-
torian attacked. There were about six of us, who had authored 
the earlier textbooks, and others who spoke up against the 
changes in school curriculum and textbooks by the (then) 
government, made without consulting educational bodies that 
would normally have been consulted. The government then 
described us as being anti-Hindu, and therefore anti-Indian, 
and therefore anti-patriotic, and therefore, traitors. 
The deletion of passages from our books and the ban on any 
discussion of the deleted passages raised a number of issues 
of various kinds pertaining to the rights of individuals and the 
ethics of government institutions.
There was also a virulent protest by some  
Indians living in the United States when the US 
Library of Congress appointed you as the first 
Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures of the 
South in 2004. What became of these protests 
and were textbooks revised when the Congress 
government replaced the Bharatiya Janata Party 
in New Delhi?
The Library of Congress rejected without any hesitation the 
demand from the Hindutva lobby, particularly Indians living 
in the United States, to reverse my appointment, therefore 
the demand was slowly silenced. The abuse online and 
through e-mails continued unabated. 
When the Congress reclaimed power in 2004, it decided 
to do away with all the previous textbooks, written by us as 
far back as the 1960s and 70s, as well as those produced 
by the BJP government just prior to its fall. A new set of 
books was commissioned, which are now in use. They are 
different from the ones we wrote and reflect some of the 
new interests in history as a discipline, and do not push a 
Hindutva hard line. 
The worrying thing is, what will happen if the Bharatiya 
Janata Party returns to power in the next election, which will 
be held within 12 months? Will they change the textbooks

again? I worry for the school children who have to be exam-
ined in the subject and depend on textbooks. 
Once we accept one religious group’s agenda and beliefs 
to be taught in the public schools, it opens the door for every 
other group to do the same thing. As educators, we have to 
make a distinction between history on the one hand, which 
involves questioning existing knowledge about the past where 
necessary, and faith on the other hand, where even myths are 
acceptable. The two have to be kept separate. The first is the 
domain of the historian and the second that of the priest.
On a wider international level, many human 
rights atrocities in recent years have sought to 
draw legitimacy from history, using the pretext of 
setting right the wrongs of the past. How can this 
be avoided?
Political parties today draw heavily on ideology and also on 
history, because a lot of the current politics is determined by 
imagined identities – either imagined racial identities, or imag-
ined religious identities, or whatever the identities may be, 
there is a construction of identities. They are projected back 
into the past, but in effect really arise out of concerns of the 
present. And these imagined identities that go into the making 
of political ideologies are very likely to grapple with history. The 
grappling also takes the form of creating the notion of what is 
believed to be a national culture, THE national culture. This is 
never questioned, because if you question it, you become a 
traitor to the nation. And it is usually a single, carefully selected 
strand from the broader culture which is drawn out and exag-
gerated, and this facilitates the potential exclusion of some citi-
zens on the basis of either religion or race or language or what-
ever identity is conveniently within reach. This is very harmful 
to issues of human rights, because it gives priority to certain 
groups and their cultures over others. 
But isn’t it a dangerous notion, for those in 
power to believe they can set right the wrongs of 
the past? 
This is a commonly made claim. We have an example, in the 
Indian case, where a Hindu political faction led by BJP leaders 
destroyed the (16th century) Babri Masjid at Ayodhya (in North-
ern India) in 1992, and claimed that they were avenging Mahmud 
of Ghazni’s attack on Somnath (a Hindu temple) and thereby set-
ting right this wrong of the past. 
First of all, did it have to take a thousand years before this act (of 
Ghazni) was avenged if indeed the idea was to avenge it? More 
important, how did it set right the wrongs of the past? What 
was the result of the destruction of the Babri Masjid? It made 
not the slightest difference to our reading of the past. What it 
did was that it resulted in a massacre of Muslims in (the West-
ern Indian state of) Gujarat, and since then, a continued series 
of bomb explosions in the major cities of the country. So what 
is argued as setting right the wrongs of the past cannot be set 
right in this fashion. And in any case, it’s a rather silly argument, 
because the past is that which has happened. It cannot be 
changed, and therefore, it’s much more important to set right 
the wrongs of the present, rather than harping on what might 
have been the wrongs of the past. 
History and Memory                      
Seeking sanction from the past involves memory and history. Very often people think that history is in fact memory formalized, 
as it were, but that is not the case. History is very different, and therefore it is important to differentiate between memory 
and history.
Memory is primarily a personal thing, and if it’s taken up by a group, it is reformulated as a collective memory. Collective memo-
ries, therefore, are not spontaneous. One person’s memory can evoke the memory of others, and can create an echo in others as 
well. But the coming together of all this is something which is a deliberate act.   
History, by definition, is not personal – it has formal rules by which one ar-
rives at a particular conclusion. It is the end-product of a clear-cut process 
which involves various stages – where the data is textual and one is using writ-
ten records, the process is very very clear. It becomes a little more ambiguous 
in archaeology, for example, when one is dealing with artefacts, which have 
to be interpreted by an archaeologist. They say very little, and the archaeolo-
gist has to try to represent what the object signifies. In fact, this is also true of 
textual data, because the historian has to interpret the text and get more data out 
of it.   The most difficult separation between memory and history comes in oral 
history, where the data is limited to memory, and the processing becomes much 
more difficult.   The role of memory is very important in terms of remembering 
the human rights part of it. The emphasis is on the fact that there are certain 
rights which are fundamental, and those rights have to be reiterated for each 
generation. The memory that goes with events that have occurred concerning 
those rights, that is very important. But memory can also be abused, like when 
people talk about setting right the wrongs of the past. This is an appeal to a 
kind of memory which is very different from the memory that concerns human 
rights, and the results are very different.
