ST. SIMEON AND THE SKYSCRAPER
Mantled in scaffolding and dwarfed by its multi-story neighbour, a 17th-century Moscow church
undergoes restoration. Located near the Kalinin Prospect, a broad, modern avenue bisecting an area recently
transformed by town planning, the church is preserved in its modern surroundings. It is dedicated to St. Simeon
Stylites, propagator of the Greek Orthodox faith and one of Russia's most venerated saints. Two years ago a
society for the preservation of historic and cultural monuments was set up in the Federal Republic of Russia,
in the U.S.S.R. Some 30,000 monuments have since been catalogued and many of them are being restored.

U.S.S.R. T
Metamorphosis of a continent
by Nikolai Mikhailov
Fifty years ago, the October Revolution of 1917 led to
the creation of the U.S.S.R« the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics. A major part of this issue of the
UNESCO COURIER is devoted to developments in
education, science and culture in the U.S.S.R. today.

I o country on earth pre¬
sents more diversity than the Soviet
Union. Primarily this is due to the
vastness of its territory: more than
22 million square kilometres (8,500,000
square miles).
From north to south the Soviet Union
stretches for nearly 5,000 kilometres
(3,000 miles). And from west to east
still more: in the Soviet Pacific port
of Vladivostok, at the end of the rail¬
way line running from Moscow, there
stands a kilometre-post bearing the
figure "9288" (6262 miles) a distance
to be found in no other single country
in the world. This is almost equal to
the distance from the pole to the equa¬
tor. When dusk falls in Vladivostok,
it is only dawn in Moscow. The New
Year is rung in 11 times, since the
Soviet Union is divided into 11 time
zones.
In area the U.S.S.R. is the world's
largest country. It could accommodate
700 Belgiums, for example.
Geographically, it would be more
appropriate to compare the U.S.S.R.
not to other countries but to continents:
it is somewhat smaller than Africa,
bigger than South America, three times
as big as Australia. It can even bear
cosmic comparisons: wherever you
see the full moon in the sky, know that
its visible face is smaller than the terri¬
tory of the U.S.S.R.; one would have
to add Argentina, say, to the moon's
NIKOLAI MIKHAILOV the Soviet geo¬
grapher and author has written widely on
the countries he has visited in many parts
of the world. A U.S.S.R. State Prize
winner, he has devoted a number of books
to the geography and evolution of the
Soviet Union. An English translation of a
recent work, "Discovering the Soviet
Union", was published by Progress
Publishers, Moscow, in 1965.
hemisphere to bring it up to the size
of the Soviet Union.
In view of the vast size of the Soviet
Union its extreme diversity should not
surprise us.
It has mountain peaks reaching above
the clouds and endless expanses of
flat lowlands. The Great Russian (East
European) Plain and the West Siber¬
ian Lowland stretch for thousands of
miles. Among the highest mountains
are the Pamirs, the Tien Shan, the Altai,
the Caucasus. The highest peak in the
U.S.S.R. (in the Pamirs) reaches to a
height of 7,500 metres (24,600 feet).
The climate is equally diversified.
There are places in Siberia that are
colder in winter than the North Pole,
and plains in Central Asia that are
hotter in summer than the tropics. In
Yahutia the winter temperature some¬
times drops to minus 70°C, while in
Turkmenia it is sometimes plus 70°C in
the sun. In the Kara-Kum Desert in
summer one can bake an egg in the
sand, while in northern Siberia, during
the winter polar nights the mercury
solidifies in the thermometer and one
can hear the crackling of the human
breath as the vapour turns into ice
crystals immediately. The Yahuts who
live there call it the "whispering of the
stars".
In Uzbekistan people begin mowing
the barley, when the inhabitants of
Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka are digg¬
ing their houses out after another
blizzard.
On the shores of the Barents Sea it
takes a hundred years for a larch tree
to grow slightly thicker than a ski stick,
while in sub-tropical Ajaría on the
Black Sea coast a young bamboo tree
shoots up over a metre in one day.
The U.S.S.R. is skirted by twelve
seas of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic
oceans. The country has the largest
network of rivers in the world, the
world's largest lake the Caspian Sea
as well as the world's deepest lake,
the Baikal (1,620 metres or 5,315 feet
at its deepest point).
The country is traversed by several
soil-vegetation zones: in the extreme
north there is a long bank of treeless,
boggy tundra covered most of the year
round by snow; the polar night there
lasts several months, illuminated not
by the rays of the sun but by the
Aurora Borealis. To the south there is
a forest belt, the world's most abun¬
dant concentration of coniferous
trees. Further south the forests thin
out and give way to the steppes; the
steppe belt with its rich fertile soil
stretches across the land for several
thousand kilometres. Still further south
the steppe turns into semi-deserts and
deserts which serve for grazing. In
those places where rivers run down
into» the desert zone from the southern
mountains, there are irrigated oases
bright greenery against a yellow back¬
ground. Finally, on the Black Sea
coast and in the southern valleys of
Central Asia, sheltered from the north
by mountains, there are sub-tropical
regions which hardly ever experience
frost. There the sea never freezes,
roses bloom in January, and even such
heat-loving plants as the date palm
bear fruit.
So the U.S.S.R. has plants that
range from dwarf birches to palm, from
lichens to lotus and animals that vary
from the snowy owl to the flamingo,
from the polar bear to» the tiger.
An immense variety of raw products
are industrially processed in the
U.S.S.R. Industry has to deal with
nearly all the elements in Mendeleyev's
Periodic Table. Soviet power stations
produce electric current from coal, coal

Second largest city of the U.S.S.R., Leningrad has a population of over three
million. Its construction was begun in 1703 by Peter the Great and from 1712 to 1918 (first as
St. Petersburg and, during the First World War, as Petrograd) it was the capital of Russia.
The Revolutions of February and October 1917 began in this city. The northernmost
large city of the world (59 degrees N) it has been called "The Venice of the North"
since it is built on over 100 islands formed by 66 rivers and canals and has 620 bridges.

dust, fuel oil, peat, combustible shales,
natural gas; ever more power is being
obtained from the energy of falling
water (600,000 million kwh for 1967).
And now a contribution is being made
to the national economy by several
large atomic power stations.
Factories throughout the country are
smelting iron and steel, copper and
nickel, lead and zinc, aluminium and
magnesium, tungsten and molybdenum,
and many other important metals. The
U.S.S.R. produces machines of every
complexity from spaceships and gi¬
gantic walking excavators, each replac¬
ing 15,000 labourers, to instruments
more sensitive than a human nerve.
The diversity of climate and soil
allows a great variety of crops to be
grown In the U.S.S.R.: rice, cotton, bar¬
ley, tea and flax.
At present the U.S.S.R. has a
population of about 240 million. Only
China and India have bigger popu¬
lations. The population is made up of
many nations, large and small; it
includes nationalities of various lin¬
guistic groups: Slavic, Turk, Finno-
Ugrian, and others; the Russian popu¬
lation exceeds a hundred million, while
in the Caucasus there is the Archi
nation, all of whom live in a single
settlement.
S
OVIET children are taught
in more than a hundred languages as
different as are the histories of their
individual speakers. In the Georgian
language there are written monuments
fifteen centuries old, while the Evenki
(Tungus), who live in northern Siberia,
have only acquired a written language
since the Socialist Revolution of 1917,
just as half a hundred other peoples of
the U.S.S.R. who had no written lan¬
guage before. The inhabitants of the
Soviet Union differ widely in appear¬
ance, the colour of their skin, their
way of life, and in number of
population (1).
But in essence they are all quite
similar. In travelling across the
U.S.S.R. one can see a Russian engi¬
neer dressed in a European-style suit,
à Ukrainian peasant women in a tra¬
ditional embroidered dress, an Uzbek
in a vari-coloured robe, a Turkmen in
a huge fur hat, a Caucasian highlander
in a sheepskin coat, an inhabitant of
the cold northland in furs. But what¬
ever the region, all men and women
share one common feature: absolute
equality. Naturally, this makes for close
ties and national unity.
The landscapes of the fifteen Repub¬
lics, making up the Soviet Union, are
all different. But the people from these
widely differing areas all live under the
same social and state structure.
This unit favours the rapid develop¬
ment of the country. Since all the
basic riches belong to the state, the
country is developing according to a
single plan. In the output of major
'industry the U.S.S.R. has now sur¬
passed Czarist Russia about seventy-
fold. Industrial output has advanced
from fourth place in Europe to first
place.
Pre-revolutionary Russia provided
1/25th of the world's industrial produc¬
tion; now the U.S.S.R's share is nearly
1 /5th, thus testifying to the country's
extraordinary growth and change during
the past half century.
T
(1) The U.S.S.R. is a multinational State.
It comprises over 100 nationalities In 15 Soviet
Republics, 20 autonomous Republics, 8 natio¬
nal regions and 10 national areas.
HE Soviet Union has be¬
come one of the world's great powers,
but this does not mean that all its
problems have been solved. This
country that was once extremely back¬
ward still has many unsatisfied needs
and unrealized possibilities. The pros¬
pects for further increasing industrial
and agricultural production are self-
evident. These include, among other
things, the exploitation of its enormous
natural resources.
Essentially, the U.S.S.R. has all the
useful minerals known on earth. It
holds first place in the world in
reserves of iron, manganese, copper,
lead, and nickel ores, in potash salts,
apatite (raw material for phosphorous
fertilizers). The U.S.S.R. has an abun¬
dance of oil, gold, diamonds, uranium.
It also leads the world in water-power
resources.
One-third of all the world's forests
are located in the U.S.S.R. and no other
country can boast of such vast stret¬
ches of fertile, chernozem soil (black
earth).
Much has already been done to
exploit these resources and to raise
the living standard of the people.
In the last decades, the economic
geography of the Soviet Union has
undergone great change and continues
to change before our very eyes. The
economic map has acquired a new
look. It has become denser and more
uniform.
Before 1917, Russia's industry was
concentrated in a few isolated areas
in the western part of the nation in
Moscow and its vicinity, St. Petersburg,
the Donbass in the Ukraine, the Urals,
the Caucasian Baku and the Baltic
ports. Since then, it has spread
throughout the land, providing each of
the Soviet nations and each region with
a basis for economic and cultural
advancement and the utilization of vir¬
gin natural resources. The movement
of industry eastward has been a
continuing trend.
Top, supply plane comes
in to land near a scientific
research station in the
Soviet Far North. Bottom,
combine-harvesters at work
in the fertile black-earth
steppe zone that stretches
for several thousand
kilometres. The largest
country in the world, the
U.S.S.R. reaches from
the Baltic to the Behring
Straits and from the Arctic
to Afghanistan. Washed
by twelve seas of the
Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic
oceans, the Soviet Union
has more rivers than any
other country, the world's
largest inland sea (the
Caspian) and the world's
deepest lake (Baikal). No
less striking is its range of
climates (from minus
70 degrees C. in parts of
Siberia to plus 70 degrees
in Central Asia).
The Donbass in the Ukraine, the
nation's principal coal region, develop¬
ed sharply, but its national share in
coal output fell from nine-tenths to
one-third because many other regions,
especially in the east, began mining
their own coal. Despite their growth,
the giant oilfields of Baku fell behind
new oil regions which sprang up bet¬
ween the Urals and the Volga. The
Urals and the Kuzbass are now com¬
peting with the Ukraine in metallurgy.
One by one the rivers were deprived
of their free and useless courses... on
the Volga and the Dnieper this har-

nessing is nearing completion, while
on the great Siberian rivers it is now
getting into full swing, on a scale
unheard of in world power engineering.
Machines are no longer being produced
in a few centres as in the past we
now can see automobiles made in
Byelorussia and Georgia, tractors from
the Urals and the Altai, lathes from
Novosibirsk, and locomotives from Bu-
ryatia (beyond Lake Baikal). New
meat, bread and clothes factories have
sprung up everywhere. The solid foun¬
dations have been laid for a nation¬
wide unified electrical power grid.
Industry and industrial development
have spread across the country. Sib¬
eria is a case in point.
In the past ten years this part of the
country, equal in area to the whole of
the United States, has witnessed fan¬
tastic transformations.
Siberia's economy is based on its
colossal natural resources and power
provided by cheap coal and rivers.
Gigantic power stations are under
construction and several are already
in operation. For example, on the An¬
gara River, in an ocean, of forests, the
world's largest hydroelectric power sta
tion, the Bratsk, has been built; and
nearby the new town of Bratsk has
grown up. Enormous enterprises are
already operating there, such as the
aluminium plant and the woodworking
complex whose buildings extend for
six kilometres. This year the first units
of a still larger hydroelectric station,
the Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisei River
is scheduled to go into operation with
a total capacity of 6 million kilowatts.
Construction has now begun on an
even more powerful station, the
Sayano-Shushensk, further north on
the Siberian Yenisei River.

Cities built
on permafrost
It is calculated that energy from coal
and rivers will turn Siberia into one of
the world's greatest power centres.
After all the power stations under
construction go into operation, Siberia
will be producing more electric power
than any Western European country.
And this is only the beginning.
The abundance of cheap power in
Siberia is paving the way to the rapid
expansion of industry. A number of
aluminium plants are already operating
in Siberia: one in Bratsk, another in
Krasnoyarsk, one near Irkutsk and
another in the Kuznetsk coal basin.
Iron and steel production is expand¬
ing. A large ¡ron-and-steel plant was
built In Novokuznetsk before World
War II, and a second one since the
war. In time, iron-and-steel plants will
also be built in other parts of Siberia.
Metal provides a basis for heavy
machine-building. The city of Novosi¬
birsk on the Ob River, for example,
now produces as many machines as
did all of Russia before 1917. Kras¬
noyarsk on the Yenisei has turned into
a major machine building centre, pro¬
ducing river boats, bridge cranes, self-
propelled combines, refrigerators,
washing machines, television sets and
pianos.

GEOLOGISTS ON THE WING
Geologists are helping to change the economic geography of the U.S.S.R. Last year,
1,000 planes and helicopters airlifted Soviet geologists to prospection areas. Total, length
of geological probes and drilling was twice that of the earth's diamater at the equator.
Top right, helicopter "taxi" for geologists lands on the tundra in. the Chukotka region
(Soviet Far East). In foreground are antlers of a reindeer herd. On landing (above)
geological team sets off for weeks and even months of arduous work and camp life in
virtually unexplored territories. Below, bearded geologist discusses day's ventures by
candlelight. Siberia keeps engineers and statisticians hard at work revising the figures
of its known wealth in oil, copper, diamonds, nickel, iron ore and other minerals.

ECENTLY one of the
world's largest oil and gas basins was
discovered in north-western Siberia, in
the Tyumen region, in the lower
reaches of the Ob River. It is already
supplying oil and gas, and long pipe¬
lines, railways and a motor-road are
being laid. By 1970 it will be produc¬
ing as much oil as the whole of Azer¬
baijan, with its famous old oil centre
Baku, did a year or two ago.
In Yakutia, located in the distant and
formerly almost impenetrable taiga, rich
diamond fields have been found and
mining has already begun. Some of the
diamonds are as much as 106 carats
in size.
New cities are mushrooming in Sib¬
eria, and three-fourths of all the cities
east of the Urals are new. Some j of
these cities, such as Norilsk, have
grown up on permafrost, the buildings
being erected on special reinforced
concrete piles driven into the ice.
Maxim Gorky once wrote: "The fabu¬
lous scenes of a future Siberia stagger
the imagination with their grandeur..."
We are close to putting these words
into effect.
A remarkable Science City has
recently grown up in a pine forest near
Novosibirsk, in the heart of Siberia.
Here have been established 14 insti¬
tutions of higher education, a scientific-
technical library with 5 million books.

U.S.S.R. TODAY (Continued)
The call of the Far North
A Siberian branch of the U.S.S.R. Aca¬
demy of Sciences has been founded
there with nearly a score of Academi¬
cians, two score corresponding mem¬
bers, and hundreds of scientific
workers.
A simple enumeration of a few of the
score of institutes there provides an
idea of the scope of the work being
done in this new scientific centre: a
mathematics institute with its own
computing centre, institutes of physics,
thermal physics, non-organic chemistry,
automation and electrometry, kinetics
and combustion, hydrodynamics, eco¬
nomics and statistics, cytology and
genetics. . .
The problems being studied include
controlled thermonuclear reactions, the
interior of the earth, cybernetics. The
hydrodynamics institute has developed
a water-cannon capable of disinte¬
grating the very hardest rock. A high¬
speed electronic computer has been
put to the unusual task of deciphering
the hieroglyphics of the Maya Indians
who lived many centuries ago in Cen¬
tral America. The average age of a
scientist in the Siberian Branch of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences in Novo¬
sibirsk is about 34 years.
A
10
STONISHING changes
have also occurred in the development
of the U.S.S.R. 's extreme North. Along
the former impassable coastal waters
skirting the north of Siberia there now
operates a regular North Sea route,
equipped in summer with ice-breakers,
including the atomic ice breaker
"Lenin." In the once wild Kola Penin¬
sula there has grown up the city of
Murmansk which has more inhabitants
than the whole of Iceland. The city of
Kirovsk has become a world centre for
the production of apatite fertilizer.
Research institutes have been founded
that investigate both the ocean bottom
and the aurora borealis. Today 90 per
cent of the inhabitants of the Kila
Peninsula are city dwellers.
The Soviet far north-east was once
a wilder and even more forsaken region
than Siberia. Today in the areas such
as the Chukotka Peninsula beyond the
Arctic Circle modern industrial enter¬
prises have been built and an atomic
power plant is under construction.
The same holds true for the far south
of the U.S.S.R., where forty years ago
practically the whole population was
illiterate, while the only form of industry
was the separation of seeds from
cotton to facilitate shipping it to the
centre of the country. Today each of
the four Central Asian Republics boasts
its own independent Academy of
Sciences.
The new distribution of industry
caused new lines of communication to
spring up and, consequently changed
the face of transportation.
Not only has the overall mileage of
railways been doubled and other trans¬
portation between the capital and other
districts been increased, but the whole
country is now linked by a vast net¬
work of railways, motor-roads and
waterways. The so-called Turksib (Tur¬
kestan-Siberian railway) now connects
Central Asia with Siberia across
thousands of miles of desert. The
South-Siberian trunk line passes
through an enormous zone from the
Southern Urals to the Kuzbass and the
Yenisei and beyond. The Volga Don
Canal forms a water bridge between
the Volga Valley and the Donbass. The
Volga-Baltic Waterway provides cheap
transportation from Leningrad and the
north to the central regions of the
country. As for the railways, nine out
of every ten tons are no longer drawn
by steam-engines but by electric or
diesel locomotives.
The agricultural map of the country
has also undergone remarkable
changes.
With the adoption of co-operative
methods and the mechanization of
farming it has been possible to elimin¬
ate those shortcoming in the utiliza¬
tion of farm1 lands that were born of
the backwardness of pre-revolutionary
agriculture.
The economic map has reflected the
rapid expansion of cultivation. The
area of tilled land has increased every¬
where, especially in the East, where
a large area of the steppes beyond
the Urals in northern Kazakhstan
and southwestern Siberia has been
brought under cultivation. In a very
short time a valuable natural resource
that had lain dormant for centuries
was put to use. Up to the time of
intense cultivation of the trans-Urals
virgin and long-fallow lands, the area
of the arable lands in the U.S.S.R.
had increased since the Revolution
by no more than the area of France.
But in a few years of work on virgin
Night scene at the
Dnieproges Dam, the
"father" of the Soviet
Union's giant hydro¬
electric installations,
built across the
Dnieper (1932). Over
2,500 feet long, It
was destroyed during
World War II. When
rebuilt in 1947, its
total power capacity
was increased to
700,000 kilowatts. The
colossal new hydro¬
electric installations
in Siberia have even
larger power capaci¬
ties: Bratsk on the
Angara (4,1 million
kw) and Krasnoiarsk
on the Yenisei (6
million kilowatts).
and long-fallow lands the Soviet East
acquired arable lands exceeding in
area the whole of Italy.
Not in all regions was the land
ready for ploughing. In many places
it first had to be prepared. In the
hot south rivers had to be diverted
to irrigate fields, and in the north bogs
had to be drained and shrubs cleared
away.
N
OW nearly all the rivers of
the far South have been brought under
control in one way or another from
the modest Salgira in the Crimea to
the Kura in Transcaucasia and the
Syr-Dariya in Central Asia. The sun-
parched deserts have been traversed
by large irrigation canals, the length
of the new Kara-Kum Canal in Turk¬
menia has already reached 800 kilo¬
mètres (500 miles). In many regions
of the Byelorussian Polesie and the
Georgian Kolkhida, swamps have been
turned into fertile ploughlands. Farm¬
ing oases have been created beyond
the Arctic Circle. The slopes of the
mountains skirting the Black Sea have
become covered with plantations of
subtropical plants.
To ensure steady and abundant
harvests in semi-arid regions, a
staggering measure is being put into
effect: forest strips are being grown
in the open steppes, changing the
whole face of the region.
Important shifts have occurred in
the distribution of crops in arable
regions. Wheat has migrated further
north into the non-chernozem zone,
sugar beet has travelled from the
Ukraine to the Far East, vegetable
gardens have sprung up around cities,
apple orchards have conquered the
Urals and Siberia, where formerly
there were none.
Such are some of the important
changes in the economic geography
of the U.S.S.R.

almost entirely by nomad tribes
of hunters and reindeer herdsmen
who were totally illiterate. The

even a written form. Today higher

national and local administrative orga¬
nizations of the country, and the natio¬
nal economy, ruined by imperialist and
civil wars, had to be set back on its
feet.
In 1913, Czarist Russia accounted for
a little over 4 per cent of the world's
industrial production, and in 1920 this
percentage was further decreased by
the slump resulting from these con¬
flicts. The country's agriculture had
also suffered heavily.
Contemporary statistics show that
at the beginning of 1917, 30 per cent of
the country's population was illiterate,
while among women, illiteracy reached
88 per cent. The local populations of
the lands surrounding Czarist Russia,
Central Asia in particular, were like¬
wise almost totally illiterate: only 5 per
cent of Tadzhiks, 6 per cent of Kirghiz-
ians, and 7 per cent of Turkmenians
could read. Only 1,400,000 out of the
165 million inhabitants in the whole of
Czarist Russia had received any
education above the primary school
level. In short, the Czarist regime
bequeathed us a burdensome legacy in
national education.
In 1919, the People's Commissariat

methods are being increasingly adapted to
the needs of modern scientific development,
and the length of compulsory schooling has
been increased. Above left, time off between

engineers in our country is negligible...
Desperately insufficient too are the
numbers of those with a secondary
technical education... The general level
of technical knowledge in Russia is
low..."
Knowledge... the nation needed it
urgently, and people in every part of
the country aspired to greater learning.
Emergent countries today are under¬
going a similar experience, with this
single exception, that in the case of
the Soviet Union there was no outside
aid. Nor was there, at that time, any
international organization such as
Unesco which could have given help
in teaching. On the other hand, Soviet
Russia had a nucleus of avant-garde
intellectuals, young students, who
though not very numerous, were full
of enthusiasm and ready to give their
energy, their time and their skill to the
cause of mass education. The schools
were open to everybody.
The new students who flocked to the
institutes and to the universities were
yesterday's workers and peasants,
with their children. Few of them had
the necessary education. So, on the
initiative of the workers of Moscow,
"workers' faculties" were created,
where adults who already had con¬
siderable experience of life could learn
the rudiments of the subjects required
for admission to institutions of higher
education. Workers' faculties were a
temporary expedient, but, given the
conditions of the time, they amply
justified their creation. Now, with the
growth and improvement of secondary
education in the U.S.S.R. they are no
longer needed.
Many present-day directors of indus¬
trial and other installations as well,
and many Soviet scholars of note,
began their training in the workers'
faculties.
One of them is Professor Evgeni
Tovstykh, Rector of the Institute of
Naval Construction in Leningrad. The
son of a workman, he started work
himself at 15. From 1926 to 1929, he
was sent by Komsomol to study at the
workers' faculty of Nikolaiev, and
thereafter, from 1929 to 1933, he
attended the Institute of Naval Con¬
struction in the same town. Once qua¬
lified as an engineer, Tovstykh, though
beginning only as a foreman, climbed
the ladder of promotion to become
director of some of the biggest
shipyards in the country, including the
Baltic Factory of Leningrad. Since
1945 he has been head of the Institute
of Naval Construction in Leningrad.
He is not only an outstanding scholar
and professor but also an active and
militant social worker.
The right of the citizen to be educ¬
ated is laid down by the Constitution
of the U.S.S.R. It is guaranteed by
eight years of compulsory schooling
and by the constant expansion of faci¬
lities for general secondary, vocational
technical, specialized secondary and
higher education, which the State
encourages. In the U.S.S.R. all forms
of education are free. Most students,
and specialized secondary school
pupils, too, have grants and free
lodging.
Since the Soviets first came to
power, the schools in the Soviet Union
have trained close on 7 million spec¬
ialists who have had a higher educa¬
tion and more than 11 million with
secondary qualifications. During the
seven-year period from 1958 to 1965
alone, more than 5 million specialists,
including 2,412,000 with higher educ¬
ation, were trained in accordance with
the plan for the development of the
national economy.
A
T the beginning of 1967,
the Soviet economy was employing
1,800,000 engineers, over 3 million
technicians, 320,000 specialists in rural
economics who had received higher
education, and approximately 500,000
who had had specialized secondary
instruction, 554,000 doctors, nearly
2 million teachers with higher educa¬
tional qualifications and 1,300,000 with
specialized secondary qualifications.
It should be observed that among the
Soviet specialists who have had a
higher education there are 2,518,000
women (52 per cent). Among those
who have a specialized secondary
education, there are more than
4,400,000 women representing 62 per
cent of the total number of specialists.
From 1940 to 1966, the vocational
training schools trained nearly 17 mil¬
lion skilled workers for different trades.
During the scholastic year 1966-1967,
the number of Soviet citizens pursuing
studies of one kind or another amount¬
ed to 72 million, 48 million of whom
were pupils in schools of general
education. Today the U.S.S.R. boasts
767 universities and institutes (or
seven times as many as in Czarist
Russia) with 4,120,000 students
(34 times the number under the old
régime), and approximately 4,000 tech¬
nical schools, with 4 million students.
Institutions of higher education in
the U.S.S.R. are of.two kinds: institutes
and universities. The institutes provide
a four to six-year course and train
engineers, agronomists, doctors, teach¬
ers, economists, -jurists and other
specialized practitioners. Such insti¬
tutes are to be found today, as are
universities, in all 15 of the federated
republics of our country.
In 1967, 900,000 new students en¬
tered institutions of higher education,
405,000 of whom attended day classes,
the rest going to evening classes or
taking correspondence courses. Stu¬
dents in faculties and institutes who

leges at their places of work. For
exemple, they can obtain a maximum
of 40 days' supplementary leave per

examinations, as well as paid leave
during the last year of study, Of four
months for students at higher educa¬
tional establishments and of two
months for pupils at specialized secon¬
dary schools, to enable them to pre¬
pare and present their diploma pro¬
jects.
Courses of study in colleges and
other institutions of higher education
are divided as follows: in advanced
technical colleges almost half the time
is spent on general subjects (social
sciences, higher mathematics, physics,
chemistry, a foreign language, etc.),
25 per cent is devoted to general tech¬
nical instruction (stress-resistance of
materials, interchangeability of machine
parts, theory of mechanics and machine
design, electro-technology, hydraulics,
etc.) and 25 per cent to 30 per cent to
special subjects. Practical work occu¬
pies nearly 25 per cent of the total
study time and experience has shown
that, provided the student has a sound
general training in the theory of each
subject, this is quite ample.
It should be noted that colleges and
universities have not given enough
attention to the importance of practical
scientific work as opposed to theo¬
retical training. In the last few years,
however, contacts with industry and
agriculture have been developed for
this purpose to a noteworthy extent.
At the request of industrial concerns,
co-operative farms (kolkhozes), state-
farms (sovkhozes) and various econo¬
mic bodies, student clubs and societies
now study the operating efficiency of
industrial and agricultural installations
and then draw up plans for machines
and machine-tools, survey the subsoil
and study demographic problems for
future scientific development.
As an instance of this, the students
of the Institute of Civil Engineering In
Moscow have prepared a project
for an experimental town in the
Polar regions, and a project for an
embankment involving improvement of
the area adjoining the reservoir in
the town of Ijevsk, in the Ural region.
The students of the Institute of Archi¬
tecture In Moscow have drawn up a
plan for the reconstruction of the
industrial sector of Ivanovo, north-east
of the capital.
The rapid increase in our scientific
knowledge (specialists consider that
the quantity of scientific Information in
the world Is doubled every ten years)
coupled with the relatively short time
that can be devoted to education de
mands constant improvement of study
methods. Films, radio, television and
computers are being called upon more
and more often to supplement tradi¬
tional methods of teaching. The study
of the problems of programmed learn¬
ing in the U.S.S.R. is of relatively
recent date, but positive experience
has already been acquired in this field.
In collaboration with specialists in
education, psychology, cybernetics and
mathematical logic, scientists and stud¬
ents at our institutes have invented
many varied teaching and testing
devices.
From year to year an ever-increasing
number of young people come from
abroad to study in the U.S.S.R. In
Soviet institutes there are many young
Asians, Africans and Latin Americans.
At present there are more than 24,000
foreigners from 130 different countries
in nearly 300 schools in the U.S.S.R.;
over 10,000 of these come from Asian,
African and Latin American countries.
Among the Soviet institutions of
higher education which train high-
ranking staff for the Asian, African and
Latin American nations, the Patrice
Lumumba Peoples' Friendship Univer¬
sity, founded in 1960, plays an impor¬
tant rôle. Close on a thousand young
engineers, agronomists, mathematic¬
ians, physicists, jurists, philologists
and economists have already com¬
pleted their studies at this university
and, specialists now in their field, have
returned to their own countries.
Apart from training foreign special¬
ists in Soviet colleges the U.S.S.R. is
co-operating on the technical side in
the foundation of study centres in
developing countries. With Soviet aid,
22 centres have been or are being built
in Burma, India, Indonesia, Ethiopia,
Cambodia, Guinea, Mali, Algeria,
Kenya, Afghanistan, Tunisia and else¬
where. Soviet establishments of higher
education help In working out plans for
teaching methods and send textbooks,
specialist publications and scientific
and technical information for these
study centres. Hundreds of Soviet
teachers are working there too.
The most important task of higher
and specialized secondary establish¬
ments is to improve the training and
education of specialists with due re¬
gard for the requirements of contem¬
porary production, science, technology
and culture and the possibilities for
their future development. To this end,
scientific groups have worked out
means of determining the scope and
the content not only of each branch of
Instruction but also of each subject.
This will be a sound guarantee of
further successes in the development
of higher and specialized secondary
education in the Soviet Union.

Students in this class belong to a new
generation of scientists and mathematicians
being formed in the special science training
centres of the U.S.S.R. In Siberia, students
qualify for places in these specialized schools
by entering a Science Olympics competition
designed to select the most naturally gifted
young people throughout the region.
scope, methods and programmes of
instruction have to be re-examined.
In a period of rapid scientific and
technological progress, a period of
what is called the "information explo¬
sion," the teaching of many school
subjects has remained unchanged or,
even worse, the old subject-matter has
been patched up with new and fashion¬
able views that give a semblance of
bridging the gap between out-dated
material and contemporary knowledge.
Formal methods of instruction, with too
much stress on memorizing, have be¬
come widespread.
Fifty years ago the main job for our
country was to liquidate illiteracy.
When that was accomplished we intro¬
duced universal elementary schooling,
then a compulsory seven-year educa¬
tion for all children, and now universal
eight-year schooling.
We are now on the threshold of uni¬
versal secondary education for young
people.
Two or three years ago we were
telling teen-agers: you've finished eight
years of school; now get a job and
repay the nation for what it spent to
educate you. Now we tell them:
modern development requires that you
possess higher education or qualifi¬
cations. Greater knowledge will give
you more versatility and your life will
be more interesting. Society will
appreciate you more if you stay on in
school until you complete a general
secondary education or, if you prefer,
enter a specialized secondary school
or a vocational school where you can
learn a good trade and professional
skills.
This approach seems simple but it
is not so easy to put it into practice.
Nothing is ever accomplished mecha¬
nically in education. Planning and
facilities may be ideal, but education
will have an influence on society only
if we carry out painstaking, individual
work with the teachers, the pupils and
the parents.
It is becoming more and more imper¬
ative that each member of the rising
generation should be given a thorough
secondary education. We intend,
within the next few years, to draw all
boys and girls into secondary school
education in one form or another.
What are these forms? First, a ten-
year general secondary education
offering courses in all subjects but
providing a good knowledge of the
fundamentals of science sufficient for
admission to college or university. We
estimate that from 70 to 75 per cent of
the young people will choose this road.
Secondly, young people may choose,
after finishing eight years of school, to
enter a technical secondary school
where, in three or four years, they
receive a general education and learn
a trade or skill that will enable them
to get medium-level specialized jobs.
These two forms, we believe, plus
evening schools and study by corres¬
pondence, will enable us to give all
young people a secondary education.
There are many problems, including the
adolescent's possible lack of desire to

continue his studies. Only by working
in close contact with each family and
each teen-ager will we be able to attain
the truly unprecedented goal of a
secondary education for all.
To do this we shall have to open,
equip and staff 8,000 new secondary
schools this year and in 1968. The
main lines along which instruction is to
develop have been mapped out. We
realize that everything cannot be
changed all at once and intend to
improve the school curriculum grad¬
ually and persistently.
A new pattern of study hours is
being introduced to relieve the exces¬
sive load the pupils now carry; there
will be 24 hours of compulsory classes
a week in the junior grades and
30 hours in the senior grades. Doctors
and physiologists agree this is more or
less the optimal pattern.
To this we add a programme of
optional subjects to meet the interests
and inclinations of the individual pupil.
Elective courses must be particularly
well-thought-out. Experts will be invited
to conduct them. A mediocre teacher
will never be able to make an elective
course stimulating. It degenerates into
idle talk or a repetition of previous
lessons.

VER the past few years
a huge team of scholars, college edu¬
cators, methodologists and school¬
teachers has painstakingly analyzed,
re-examined and, in the main, approv¬
ed new syllabuses. The main idea has
been to avoid overloading the pupil's
memory with facts. Instead, the basic
laws governing the development of the
material world and social processes
will be studied from the standpoint of
our contemporary understanding of
them.
In the biological sciences the pupils
will, of course, gain a picture of the
great variety of forms of life, from the
virus to the human being. However,
the important thing is not to memorize
the names of the countless species,
families, etc., but to grasp the basic
laws governing the functions of the
living organism. This is what the
course in general biology now included
in the syllabus sets out to do, but so
far it is making slow headway in the
schools.
In chemistry the pupils will have to
learn about a great number of both
natural and synthesized substances.
Their efforts will be rewarded by an
understanding of the laws governing
the formation of chemical substances,
presented in up-to-date, comprehen¬
sible form in the courses provided
in organic and inorganic chemistry.
The course in the literature of the
peoples of the Soviet Union and other
nations naturally cannot encompass
everything. Not even specialized
college courses can. The secondary
school literature programme aims not
at "covering" a work of fiction but at
teaching the pupil to think about it, to
think about the social facts and con¬
ditions and moral principles it deals
with, discern the beauty of the imagery,
and develop a taste for reading.
Methods of instruction must be acti-
vized and individualized, stripped of the
stereotypes that sometimes result from
strictly following set teaching methods
supposedly suitable for all occasions.
We believe that the closer instruction
comes to the principle that "learning is
an act of discovery" the more success¬
ful it will be.
Laboratory experiments and demon¬
strations are not always meant merely
to confirm the generally accepted
laws recorded in the textbooks. More
often they are a study of laws and an
observation of facts that have to be
understood and explained a process
by which the experienced teacher leads
his pupils up to the discovery of a
law. In the final analysis, it is develop¬
ment of methods of instruction that
make the pupil realize science is not
something complete and unchanging
but is an ever deeper penetration into
the sphere of the unknown.
That, roughly, is the line reconstruc¬
tion of the curriculum and the sylla¬
buses is now taking. It presupposes,
naturally, the Installation and provision
of laboratories, study rooms, good text¬
books and manuals, teaching aids
which include technical equipment and
machines for programmed instruction,
and many other items.
T
ODAY'S younger genera¬
tion is living in a fortunate period.
Human genius has penetrated deeply
into the essence of social phenomena,
which man is using to remake the
world in the name of human happiness.
Human genius is delving deeply into
the secrets of the universe and the
essence of matter. Man has gone out
into space and is sending probes to
distant planets. He has discovered
a new form of energy, nuclear energy.
Ho is investigating living phenomena
and is, as yet timidly, changing their
lower forms. Progress is only a matter
of time.
A generation is growing up of inquir¬
ing, active young people inspired by
the great ideals of transforming the
world into a satisfying place for
everyone. And the schools are doing
their best to educate a new generation
of young people imbued with an
optimistic outlook.

NEW HORIZONS IN MOSCOW
Moscow, capital of the U.S.S.R., is a swiftly growing metropolis.
Greater Moscow counts some five million inhabitants and in the
built-up areas that have risen along the main highways from
the city, live three million more. New plans for urban
development aim to link up these suburban population centres
and to create a number of modern cities on the outskirts

SOVIET CULTURE
(Continued from page 21)
more than 40 years of my life to film¬
making, that phenomenal art born of
the twentieth century, inseparable from
scientific and technical achievements
and part and parcel of the mainstream
of modern life.
Perhaps the best way to get a true
picture of our age might be to view
one after another, all the great films
of the 20th century, from Griffith's
"Intolerance" and Eisenstein's, "Battle¬
ship Potemkln" to the pictures of 1967.
Naturally, the cinema could not have
performed this historic feat if It did
not rely on the complex nature of the
other arts that produced the synthetic
essence of the cinema and gave It
life. Consequently, film-makers, giving
the truth its due, never forget that
literature is the father of all the arts,
and music their mother.
When I go back in thought to the
sources of Soviet culture, I see, along
with men who were close to me
professionally, besides 25-year-old
Eisenstein, the gigantic figure of Maya-
kovsky, his contemporary, and 18-year-
old Shostakovich.
Their generation started life along
with the many millions who had just
crossed the threshold into our great
era.
Here it would be well to recall what
Czarist Russia was like in the opening
years of the 20th century, an empire
sprawled across two continents, from
the Baltic and Black Seas to the
Pacific.
When I close my eyes on a sleep¬
less night, the memory that recorded
childish impressions for my whole life
brings back a picture of the fat police¬
man who stood on the corner of
Malakhovskaya Street in Ekaterinburg,
where I was born, and the street itself,
knee-deep in mud in spring and
autumn. I recall the houses of the
merchants as they stood jutting up
in the midst of wretched hovels.
Those houses resembled chests of
drawers, filled with bed-bugs and fetid
stupidity, with the arrogance and
quivering flesh of somnolent gluttons.
I recall the village where I spent the
years of my childhood, with its com¬
pletely natural economy, where each
fed and clothed himself and his family
from what his pitiful farm could pro¬
duce.
So it went all over the country,
with the exception of a few cities
where living conditions came up to
the modern standards of amenities in
the age of steam and electricity.
Towering over all this were ancient
Moscow and St. Petersburg, the re¬
splendent capital of the Russian
empire and the home of Russia's
wealthiest landowners where, side by
side with the glitter of court society,
there arose a great national culture
that gave mankind such men of genius
as Dostoyevsky, Pushkin, Tolstoy,
Chekhov, Gogol and Shevchenko.

known to the Czar's officials and quite
unknown to the city dwellers, were
tens of millions of men and women in
tree-bark shoes and homespun cloth¬
ing. And still farther away were the
alien folk, whom even the Czarist
governors who ruled them could not
make out. To the man in the street
these distant people were no more
than geographic elements and not
human beings of different races with
their own soul or mind or heart. They
viewed them as objects without feel¬
ings, without language or alphabet.
All this is what Russia inherited
when Czarism collapsed. The Octo¬
ber Revolution decided the history of
our country. It set out on a new road.
Here is where the sacramental
question arose, the question Romain
Rolland later formulated as "On whose
side are you, masters of culture?" To
the Russian intelligentsia's honour, it
had the insight, spiritual force and
common sense to make its choice.
Our people will» never forget that side
by side with them were such giants
as Pavlov and Timiryazev, Blok and
Mayakovsky, Meyerhold and Stanislav¬
sky, Petrov-Vodkin and Nesterov.
In all justice, it should be noted that
many of Russia's prominent intellec¬
tuals were unable immediately to
understand and accept in their hearts
the immense changes taking place in
their native land. They were frighten
ed by the austere and inexorable early
years of the Revolution and left. Later,
many of them returned home. Others
remained abroad to the end of their
days.

besides Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev,
the Central Asian republics, once the
most remote border regions of the
Russian empire. Whether writers,
artists or businessmen, they often
return from Central Asia deeply
impressed by what they saw even in
the shortest of visits. It may be that
the phenomenal flowering of these
Central Asian republics is the most
striking testimony to the moral as well
as economic victory of our country.
We ourselves regard this achievement
as our greatest. To us it is all the
more revealing because we know what
those places were like before.
Any list of the most respected,
world-famous Soviet artists, writers
and musicians would be extremely
long, but the very first names would
certainly include the brilliant Kirghiz
novelist Chingiz Aitmatov, son of a
shepherd; the poet and war hero
Musa Jalil; the truly amazing poet and
philosopher Rasul Gamzatov; the inex
haustibly gifted Armenian painter Mar-
tiros Saryan and his fellow countryman
Aram Khachaturyan, and Kara Karaev
of Azerbaijan.
Having mentioned a few names,
without which what I want to say might
seem abstract, I think it would be well
to consider how it came about that an
illiterate country, condemned to spend
its long winter nights by the light of
rush candles, was able to make such
a colossal leap forward. Naturally,
when the country embarked on its
active post-revolutionary development
it progressed along with the rest of
the twentieth century in spite of the
inevitable isolation it was forced into.
The tremendous thirst for knowledge
awakened by the cultural revolution in
the twenties made the Soviet citizen
perhaps the most avid reader in the
world. With books having remained
silent friends and companions of each
individual reader, a special Soviet way
of living with literature has come into
being. The readers' conferences held
regularly at hundreds of thousands of
libraries and factory and rural recrea¬
tion centres, and poetry readings
before audiences of many thousands
are but two of the new features char¬
acteristic of our culture.
On several occasions I have accom¬
panied visitors from abroad to such
gatherings. I could not help feeling
proud of the impression our readers"
conferences made on them: The
heated arguments, keen observations,
ability to understand the literary impli¬
cations below the surface, and the
appreciation of style.
This brings to the forefront an
important feature of modern social
man, in the best meaning of the word,
and that is his unselfish interest in
matters of common concern, and his
sense of responsibility for the moral
achievements, in which each sees a

SOVIET CULTURE (Continued)
Controversies on the borders of realism in art
major fruit of his labours. It is not
only houses, factories, shops and
handsome streets and cities that
reveal the level of a civilization. The
most important yardstick is man him¬
self, his code, of ethics, his attitude
to the world, to good and evil, to
strength and weakness, to the goal
of life. That is what the reader looks
for in the books he reads, the plays
he attends, the new paintings and films
he sees.
At this point the eternal debate
arises: what is art, what is its purpose?
The debate arises with greater and
greater force at every new dividing
line in history. Many are inclined to
accuse us of utilitarianism, of being
didactic, even of distorting the sacred
predestination of art by applying it to
the practical needs of society, to the
organization of government itself.
That is both true and not true.
It would be hypocritical and false to
dismiss that view I would not call
it an accusation out of hand. We
have no intention of either cancelling,
or evasively skirting, the specific fea¬
tures of our way of life.
Yes, all of us writers, artists, musi¬
cians and film-makers are co-operat¬
ing in a gigantic programme on which
we have embarked at the call of our
hearts and in the interests of our own -
people and other peoples who conti¬
nue to be threatened by a great num¬
ber of dangers derived from brutality
and despotism.
The programme is so important to
us and is so much a part of the
substance and content of our life
that most of us are unable to draw
a strict dividing line between our per¬
sonal concerns and the concerns of
society. Speaking without any of the

propagandiste accentuation which the
modern man so abhors, and within the
framework of discovering the truth, a
man's work, if he is completely
engrossed in it, is an integral part of
his private life, sometimes much more
so than purely family matters.
It is this heightened personal atti¬
tude on the part of everyone working
in the extensive sphere of culture, a
sphere encompassing all the meridians
and parallels of our vast country, that
makes up the essence of our attitude
to the importance and significance of
one or another artistic phenomenon.
In our professional environment it
is natural that there should be contro¬
versies concerning form, the borders
of realism, and the breadth of its
shores. I see no harm at all in the
fact that the debate often reaches a
high pitch of intensity.
It Is because they are seemingly so
innocent and bloodless that literary
and artistic battles often grow aggra¬
vated with remarkable ease. Here
the youth naturally play a special part.
Doing their duty in the succession of
generations, they logically act accord¬
ing to the dialectical law of "negation
of the negation."
We would be poor dialecticians if
this circumstance were to fill us with
undue fears.' We know definitely that
in the development of that law any
negation must be followed by an affir¬
mation, which will be followed by ano¬
ther negation-affirmation, since in our
concept of the world everything is
continuously developing.
That is why, while we are aiming
at the future, we cannot discard the
past with curious arrogance or infan¬
tile naivete. To us, the historical pro-
Young artists visit
an exhibition of
Kinetic Art in
Moscow. Some of
these art forms
are based on
mathematical
formulae projected
in three
dimensions. Others
show moving
elements of light.
In the past few
years there has been

cess is continuous. This was clearly
formulated by Lenin in his argument
with Bogdanov concerning the attitude
to a cultural legacy.
To us, modern art draws on the
greatness of ancient and medieval art,
the Renaissance, and the art of the
recent past, in which before our eyes
there arose the brilliant figures of such
artists as Picasso, Diego Rivera and
Siqueiros, men who have never for a
moment separated their art from the
interests of humanity and who have
waged violent battles, sometimes with
themselves, for artistic truth.
Hence, to us the names of the young
poets who now tour many countries
and have become widely known in
Europe and America, the names of
Evtushenko, Rozhdestvensky and
Akhmadulina, are all signs of the
times, contemporary features of our
many-levelled culture, inseparables
connected with the interests of all
men.
Behind these poets stand the people,
who have the right both to love
them and to make demands on them
in keeping with the laws of spiritual
unity that have become the foundation
of our community. Again, this is a
special feature that may appear awk¬
ward, even unbearable, to the solipsist
artist, whose only life companion is
himself. This is a principled difference
we have no intention of either erasing
or evading. The difference lies in
the very depths of our society and
our national traditions, the traditions
of the Russian intelligentsia, which
from Pushkin and the Decembrist
poets, throughout the brilliant writings
of the nineteenth century by Gogol,
Shevchenko, Hertzen, Tolstoy and
Dostoyevsky, showed that it had insep¬
arable spiritual ties with the people.
Now the people, too, have changed.
They produce from their depths much
new talent that is shaped gradually,
in amateur groups, in factory literary
clubs, at public lecture courses on
the arts. Before you know it, you
have world-famous groups like Igor
Moiseyev's folk dance company, which
has scored a truly unprecedented suc¬
cess all over the world.
As a film-maker, it would be only
fitting if I were to pay some tribute to
cinema art in this brief survey. With¬
out beating about the bush I could
simply list the dozens of first prizes
won at international film festivals. But
what is the use of self-praise and
self-glorification? History judges us.
We are only 50 years old, a mature
age for human beings but youthful for
a country.
As I look backward, and then into
the future, I think: each of us can say
he is growing older, and that we are
all mortal, but the advantage of our
life has been that we have devoted
it to mankind's youngest cause.

In 1913, scientific workers
and lecturers in Russlon higher educa¬
tional establishments numbered about
10,000. Today, the Soviet Union has
about 700,000 scientific workers a
quarter of all the scientists in the
world. Under the Soviet régime, the
membership of the Academy of
Sciences has grown to more than two
hundred times its former size, and
there has been an almost one-hundred¬
fold increase in the number of scientific
publications.
Each Republic of the Union has Its
own Academy of Sciences, with well
organized and equipped scientific
centres engaged in various types of
research. For example, the Academy
of Sciences of the Ukrainian S.S.R.
has about fifty scientific institutes.
Soviet physicists have synthesized
chemical elements 102 and 104 of the
periodic system of Mendeleev. Not

700,000 SCIENTISTS (Continued)
The mushroom growth
of research centres
32
Russian town of Serpukhov, the
world's most powerful particle accele¬
rator, a 70-Bev proton synchrocyclo¬
tron, will soon be in operation.
It cannot, of course, be said that
Soviet science began in a vacuum,
for Russia had great scientists before
the Soviet Revolution. The history of
science has an honoured place for
such researchers as Nikolai Loba-
chevsky, the inventor of. non-Euclidean
geometry, Dmitry Mendeleev, the
creator of the periodic system of che¬
mical elements, Aleksandr Butlerov,
the author of the first works on the
structure of organic compounds, and
llya Mechnikov, one of the founders
of immunology, the science which
investigates the defensive mechanisms
of the human organism.
The Czarist Government, however,
often attacked daring scientific thought,
with the result that the general level
of development in pre-Revolutionary
Russia was very low.
Despite the extremely difficult con¬
ditions created by the Civil War (1918-
22) foreign intervention, the blockade
and the economic dislocation which
affected every region of the country,
Lenin and his colleagues never lost
sight of the needs of Soviet science,
then in its infancy.
It might be thought that, in a country
whose industry and transport had been
destroyed and whose agriculture could
barely provide a starvation level of
sustenance for the population, the
first duty of the nation's leaders would
be to foster the development of applied
scientific research yielding immediate
practical results, and that abstract
science could wait.
But it was clear to Lenin that the
new society could not be built without
the active participation of the basic
sciences, for that was the only way
in which conditions favourable to the
rapid growth of applied research could
be created. Otherwise, the U.S.S.R.
would be condemned to perpetual
dependence on foreign science.
Lenin knew that unless a sufficiently
high level of development were attain¬
ed in mathematics, physics, mechanics,
chemistry, biology and the other
natural sciences, plans for building
socialism would remain merely Uto¬
pian. He therefore used all the means
in his power to mobilize scientists and
direct their efforts towards the dev¬
elopment of fundamental scientific
research and the establishment of
large, modern scientific centres.
As early as the years 1918-1920,
physico-technical, optical and radium
institutes were set up in Petrograd
(today Leningrad) while Moscow saw
the establishment of institutes of
physics and biophysics and of the
Central Institute of Aerodynamics the
famous "Tsagi" which has produced
the greatest Soviet mechanicians, air¬
craft constructors and rocket en¬
gineers. From 1920 onwards, the
number of scientific centres increased
year by year.
A second, extremely important
reason for the dynamic growth of
Soviet science was the introduction of
a universal system of popular educa¬
tion which made it possible for talented
young people to have scientific training.
Much was also due to the fact that,
from the very first years of the Revo¬
lution, scientific research was organ¬
ized on the basis of an integrated
national plan, under which goals and
objectives for the study and solution
of the most pressing problems of
science and technology at any given
time were fixed with reference to
scientific developments in the world
as a whole. The Soviet Union is
perhaps the first country which has
organized its scientific planning on a
nation-wide basis.
In 1920, Lenin Initiated the prepa¬
ration of the famous "Goerlo" plan,
which provided for the building of a
vast network of power stations and
for the development of industry over
a period of ten to fifteen years.
Lenin's electrification plan like all
subsequent scientific and economic
plans proved eminently feasible, for
the targets set by "Goerlo" were two
to three times over-fulfilled.
After the victory of 1945, world
science embarked on a new course
mapped out by the whole of its pre¬
vious evolution. Practical applications
were found for the results of a great
deal of basic research, notably in
atomic energy, electronic computing
and the exploration of space.
In nuclear physics, Igor Kurtchatov
contrived to build up around him and
to organize large groups composed
of the finest engineers and researchers
in various special fields. Soviet
scientists, for instance, were the first
to use hydrogen as a nuclear fuel.
In the conquest of space a pre¬
dominant rôle was played by Sergei
Korolyov. He, like Kurtchatov, had
a genius for co-ordinating the work
of researchers and constructors.
Soviet scientists and engineers were
the first to put into orbit an artificial
satellite and a manned capsule. The
launching of the first sputnik was a
tremendous spur to the development
of world science.
The last ten years have been marked
by the accelerated growth of research
centres, both in number and in quality.
Apart from questions of- nuclear energy
and the exploration of space, there
are many centres actively engaged on

million. Already a big industrial centre, the city has also

of Akademgorodok, known as "Science City." Twenty-five
miles from Novosibirsk, over 3,000 acres of virgin forest

country's scientific institutes; planning
scientific development at a time when
the volume of scientific knowledge
can double in ten or twelve years;
finding the best ways of selecting and
training scientists and skilled workers,
the demand for whom is growing by
leaps and bounds; and somehow
strengthening the link between science
and the national economy.
As an example of how we in the
U.S.S.R. are tackling problems of this
type, I should like to say something
about the work of my own department
the Siberian Section of the Aca¬
demy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.
From the earliest years following
the October Revolution, Siberia and
the Soviet Far East experienced a
massive development, both economic
and cultural. Universities sprang up
at Irkutsk and Vladivostok; schools
and factories mushroomed everywhere
and finally a number of branches of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences were
established. In brief, this wild region,
which had previously served chiefly
as a place of exile, began slowly to
change into a civilized area.
During the first Five-Year Plan there
grew up the new metallurgical centre
of the Kuznetsk Basin, which today
has an essential rôle in the national
economy. Siberia's contribution during
the Second World War is inestimable;
together with the Urals, it sent to the
front equipment and fighting men of
the highest quality.
Victory won, the Soviet people
concentrated the greater part of its
energies on reconstructing its shatter¬
ed towns and factories and restoring
a devastated countryside. During this
difficult period, only slow progress
was made with the development of
Siberia. We had to wait until 1956,
and the 20th Party Congress, before
a fresh stimulus was given to these
regions with their fabulous unexplored
natural wealth. A plan was drawn
up providing for intensive underground
prospection, the establishment of an
infrastructure for industry and energy
resources and a huge network of
secondary schools and higher edu¬
cational establishments. Science was
given a fresh start.
To achieve rapid and complete
results it was, of course, necessary
to reinforce existing establishments
mainly regional branches of the
U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and
government research centres. Above
all it was essential to create centres
and institutes capable of carrying out
basic studies ranking with scientific
research at world level.
In 1957 the Soviet Government
therefore decided to set up a Sib¬
erian section of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences and to build a big scien¬
tific centre which would be responsi¬
ble for all the branches and institutes
of the Academy of Sciences situated
east of the Urals.
A government committee was spe¬
cially nominated to draw up the
statutes of the Siberian section and
to establish a timetable for the
construction, equipment and launching
of the new centres. The committee
was given a programme and, drawing
upon national and international exper¬
ience, it began by laying down guiding
principles.
The site selected for the new scien¬
tific centre was in a pine forest on the

edge of the Obi Reservoir, 25 kilo¬
metres (15 miles) south of Novosibirsk.
In seeking to attract to Siberia first-
rate scientists, it was important to take
full advantage of this natural scenic
beauty.
Since its foundation nine years ago,
Akademgorodok, or "Science City"
as it has been called, has greatly
expanded. Its citizens today include
16 Academicians, 30 Corresponding
Members of the Academy, 95 Doctors
of Science and 950 Candidates.
Workers and office staff number
16,000.
The centre is concerned with all
the major problems of modern science;
every branch is represented: mathe¬
matics, physics, chemistry, biology,
geology and the social sciences, and
each yields results of the greatest
significance. Some of the work has
been awarded the Lenin Prize nuclear
physics research concerning the induc¬
ed collision of beams of particles,
studies on the theory of detonation
and on applied cybernetics. Geolo¬
gists, biologists and mathematicians
have achieved remarkable successes.
Scarcely had the organization of
the Siberian section got under way
than our research teams established
close contacts with the industry and
economy of Siberia and the Far East.
The specific problems of this vast
region with its low population density
have been studied with particular
attention. Our scientists have given
hundreds of lectures on current prob¬
lems of science in towns and in large
factories; we have undertaken a de¬
tailed study on ways in which Siberia's
special climatic conditions hamper
the development of industry notably
the mining industry.
Though in most instances we have
had to be satisfied with giving general
advice, joint studies have also fre¬
quently led to close collaboration over
several years. Today the institutes
controlled by our centre are in per¬
manent contact with more than 300
factories and enterprises in the East.
Joint efforts by scientists and in¬
dustrialists have enabled us to find
practical economic uses for fundamen¬
tally new scientific concepts. At Novo¬
sibirsk researchers and industrialists
are together studying the industrial
application of a new technology which
uses the method of flash welding to
obtain laminated materials. This most
promising technique offers almost un¬
limited combinations of metals to meet
desired specifications. For example,
we have some "bl-metals" whose resis¬
tance to heat and whose refractory
and anti-corrosive properties are quite
remarkable. These may be of great
utility for chemical apparatus, electro-
technical installations, etc.
I
HE study of the behaviour
of dynamically supercharged water has
given rise to the "impulse currents"
theory and this in turn has enabled
us to build a whole range of super-
powerful presses intended for stamp¬
ing out shaped components in different
metals. These hydraulic-impulse pres¬
ses giving an impact energy of the
order of 200 strokes per minute are at
present undergoing trials in the facto¬
ries of Novosibirsk. This alliance bet¬
ween science and production is bound
to expand in the future.
Unfortunately, experience has shown
that a direct transition from science
to industry is not always successful; we
have seen considerable efforts by both
parties end in failure, each side being

m«
fully convinced that the other was
to blame. The conclusion we draw is
that it is no good approaching big
industry without adequate preparation,
and without realizing quite clearly that
the more revolutionary an idea, the
greater the need to work it out fully
on the spot and to perfect its techno¬
logy.
In response to our proposal, the Sov¬
iet Government has decided to set up
a series of pilot plants and construc¬
tion centres near to Soience City.
These are intended to be the half¬
way house between a scientific disco¬
very and its practical application. It is
here that students or trainees in the
last year of higher studies can, by way
of vocational training, gain practical
experience in new products and new
technologies so that when we submit
drawings, technological plans or proto¬
types to industrialists, we can send
them at the same time young people
who have played an active part in
their creation.
We already have two pilot projects
of this nature: one specializing in hy¬
draulic stamping equipment and an¬
other dealing with economic evalua¬
tion and planning. The first has per¬
fected a new range of machines found¬
ed upon the principles already des¬
cribed, and giving pressures and
speeds never before attained. The
prototypes have been built and are
now being tested for resistance to wear
and for stability. The second project
has a purely economic function; it is
already dealing with innumerable in¬
quiries concerning optimum layout of
equipment and buildings and the cons¬
truction of new industrial plants. We
are now setting up another pilot plant
for research and construction, specia¬
lizing in small-scale accelerators for
industrial use, catalysers, precision
instruments, etc.

700,000 SCIENTISTS (Continued)

The man behind
Science City
Founder of Akademgorodok, Siberia's
Science City, the distinguished scientist,
Mikhail Lavrentiev finds time, between
his research, lectures and
administrative work, to take an interest
in every aspect of its life. Left,

bungalow the city's oldest house. Above,

a chat with one of his assistants.
Below, on a boat trip with his daughter
Vera, also a mathematician,
and his granddaughter.
Since its creation, the Siberian sec¬
tion has consistently sought to attract
young talent and to educate and train
it. The Soviet Union may justly pride
itself on possessing the largest net¬
work of secondary schools and higher
educational establishments in the
world.
The attraction exerted by science
and technology upon Soviet youth is
unmistakable. In addition to schools,
technical clubs abound where young¬
sters of 10 to 12 years of age build
model boats or aircraft, assemble wire¬
less sets and so on. Even so, we
consider that the development of our
education lags behind our needs
behind the evolution of science and
technology.
The shortage of qualified staff is
particularly acute in centres of higher
education and in those technical fields
which are working on the newest scien¬
tific discoveries. When organizing our
university in Science City, we plan¬
ned to base our teaching on the system
of laboratories attached to the research
institutes and to recruit our teachers
as widely as possible from among both
the older and the younger generations
of scientists. That is what we do in
practice.
In view of the outstanding educa¬
tional opportunities which we are able
to offer young people and because of
the limited capacity of our laboratories,
we have naturally had to adopt a
system of selection which ensures
the admission to our university of
talented young people who know exact¬
ly what they want to do.
A
S regards mathematics and
physics, and later chemistry, we solved
the problem by arranging a selective
system of "Scientific Olympics," orga¬
nized in three stages and open to the
largest possible number of candidates.
This revealed that in the remote re¬
gions of Siberia mathematical apti¬
tudes are underdeveloped solely be¬
cause of insufficiently qualified teach¬
ing staff. Today, therefore, our selec¬
tion is carried out in depth and we
have even set up a residential col¬
lege for studies in physics and ma¬
thematics, specifically for young people
who have a natural talent but an In¬
sufficient stock of knowledge.
Six years' experience have convinced
us of the success of this system. In
a few years, not only shall we be able
to provide our own replacements, but
also to supply other higher schools
and research centres with large num¬
bers of graduate and of Doctors in
Science, eminently qualified and pos¬
sessing a high creative potential.
As Science City itself has grown,
many branch centres and institutes in
the East have also been considerably
expanded. The major impetus has
been given to the branch at Irkutsk,
where the local Institute of Energy has

achieved outstanding results and now
boasts a first-class electronic comput¬
ing centre. Equally satisfying progress
has been recorded by the scientific
establishments at Yakutsk, Magadan
and Vladivostok.
Having gradually overcome the dif¬
ficulties of growth, the Siberian section
is developing and spreading; its net¬
work of research centres is expanding
and its contacts with the national eco¬
nomy grow stronger. From year to
year the wealth of our country in¬
creases, as does the rôle of science in
its industry and its economy. Yet
while working at our daily tasks, we
are also duty bound to look to the
future, paying special attention to
training a new generation of the highest
quality. The future development of
our country depends entirely upon the
men and women we train today.

A TV programme
girdling the world
o,
38
'VER six hundred million
viewers one sixth of the world's
population this was the potential
audience for the remarkable television
programme, "Our World", broadcast on
June 25 in 31 countries. Of course,
not all these six hundred million people
will actually have switched on their
sets at that moment; but still one
is safe in saying that no show on
earth has had such an audience
before.
The newspapers have already car¬
ried detailed descriptions of the pro¬
gramme itself. But what went on
behind the scenes is less well known
and just as fascinating.
The idea was born in Spring 1966.
For some years now, television sta¬
tions in western Europe have got
together to organize joint transmissions
of major sporting events and other
spectacles of international interest;
these link-ups, no longer a rarity, are
arranged by Eurovision, part of the
European Broadcasting Union.
At one of the European Broadcast¬
ing Union's meetings, the British
Broadcasting Corporation put forward
a suggestion: why not try for one day
to go beyond purely European colla¬
boration and arrange a world-wide
hook-up using communication satel¬
lites?
The European television organiza¬
tions were enthusiastic about the pro¬
ject. But in the United States the
commercial structure of television
caused some difficulties: the broad¬
cast was to last two full hours, and
the U.S. network could hardly accept
a period as long as that free from
publicity. However, the National
Educational Television network (NET),
a nonprofit organization, agreed to take
part. But naturally the audience in
the U.S.A. was not as big as it would
have been if the programme had been
carried by one of the major networks.
What about the other continents?
Unfortunately there could be no
question of the programme being seen
in all countries of the world, and this
above all for technical reasons. The
broadcast was relayed from continent
to continent via satellites in stationary
orbit 36,000 kilometres (22,500 miles)
by Pierre de Latil
above the earth. At present, few
countries possess the sensitive aerials
needed to receive signals from these
satellites.
Of course, the signals, once receiv¬
ed, can be sent on to other countries
by conventional means coaxial cables
or microwave transmissions and in
highly industrialized regions there are
dense communication networks of this
kind. But many parts of the world
Asia (outside Japan), tropical Africa
even Latin America lack such faci¬
lities.
When the day comes that satellite
relay transmitters are powerful enough
to be picked up by less sophisticated
aerials, direct communication with the
whole world will be possible.
The project faced one other major
difficulty. Co-ordinating the transmis¬
sion of "canned" (pre-recorded) pro¬
grammes is a relatively simple matter.
But "Our World" was broadcast "live":
what was seen on the screen was
actually happening in another part of
the world at that very moment. This
made the whole operation very much
more complicated. But as it turned
out, timing was perfect all along the
line, and world-wide television passed
with flying colours one of the stiffest
tests it is likely to meet: perfect co¬
ordination of a long programme made
up of many short contributions which
all have to fit together like the pieces
of a jigsaw puzzle.
There were tricky problems of "con¬
trol" to be solved. Let's see how
they were ' tackled. In each country
where more than one sequence was
to originate, the places where the
various contributions were coming
from were connected to a "national
control". These national controls
were themselves linked to "interna¬
tional controls": New York for America,
Australia and Japan for Asia, and Brus¬
sels for Europe. The signals were
passed across the Atlantic and Pacific
via satellite, but within Europe they tra¬
velled by more conventional means.
The "master control" was in London,
linked both to Brussels and, by satel¬
lite, to New York.
A precise second-by-second time¬
table had been drawn up, so that eacn
producer, whether he was bringing to
the world screen shrimp-fishing in
Japan, scenes from Romeo and Juliet
in an Umbrian church, or folk-dances
in a village square in Mexico, knew
exactly when his "contribution" to the
programme was due to start.
The nerve centre in London was
directed by Aubrey Singer, head of
the BBC Outside Broadcast Features
and Science Department. As Euro¬
pean Broadcasting Union Project Edi¬
tor, he had in front of him monitors
showing the transmission sequence,
and test pictures from the next two
sequences to follow. He was also In
telephone contact with these three
units, and was thus able to give them
personally their "countdown" and go
ahead signal.
As soon as one sequence went on
the air, one of the two "waiting"
screens became free for the next
sequence in line, coming either from
Brussels or New York. In the European
control room in Brussels, where the
French director Alexandre Tarta was
in charge, the set-up was the same:
two sequences "standing-by" on two
monitor screens, and as soon as one
of them went on the air, another was
switched in from Austria, France or
Sweden...
So carefully had the two-hour pro¬
gramme been planned that everything
went off smoothly.
The timing was perfect too, except
for one sequence, showing the famous
painter Miro at work in the South of
France, which overran a few seconds:
the artist took a little bit longer than
expected to finish a drawing. But
after all, age and art could hardly be
hurried in the name of technical
perfection!

dant pulled the blinds at the big

to Addis Ababa.
The landscape below the plane was
incredible, like blown-up views of the
craters of the moon. Dry, desolate,
crinkly, for scores of miles as far as
the eye could see. No trace of habi¬
tation, cultivation, road, or river: untidy
sharp dusty hills, a dull red in colour.
Later the landscape became more
mountainous, with the characteristic
high plateaus and steep jagged decli¬

ley. Still no habitations, but gradually
as we approached Addis and the plane
descended lower, little communities
could be seen, some winding paths,
an occasional stream, and green

NLY later, during a series
of comfortable air excursions to distant
towns, does one discover the incre¬
dible richness of the antiquities of
Ethiopia. This is a land of contrasts;
it is so highly developed as a leader
in contemporary African affairs, and
yet so remote and medieval and
untouched in its hinterlands.
The antiquities are glorious and of
international significance to archaeolo¬
gists and art historians, but one travels
to seek them outside the capital. In
Addis there are only two good mu¬
seums, and an excellent display of
indigenous building types on the
grounds of the Ethio-Swedish Building
College.
One travels far into the countryside
to see the astounding physical remains
of the three great peaks of Ethiopian
culture: To the north, where Axum
and the surrounding lands are filled
with obelisks, temples, and tombs of
the early centuries of the Christian
era, to Lalibela for the unbelievable
unique rock-cut churches of the
Middle Ages, and to Gondar, the
former capital of the Empire, where
splendid palaces and churches of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
show a sophisticated cultural develop¬
ment that reflects Arab as well as
European connexions.
The French archaeologists say it is
difficult to date the great obelisks
and tombs at Axum more closely than
from the second to the sixth century.
The obelisks are called stelae. They
are monolithic shafts, and there are a
hundred or so, most fallen. A few
are still erect or have been erected.
The largest of the fallen ones (fully
carved to represent a nine-story
building with doors and windows) is
as tall as a nine-story building. It is
bigger than any Egyptian obelisk, and
is probably the largest single worked
stone ever set up by man! The group
set in a park is overwhelming.
Nearby is the infinitely moving old
cathedral of St. Mary, called the
Basilica. It is full of life and
hoary antiquity, although the present
structure is a replacement of the
17th century. It is on the site of the
most ancient and venerated of all
Ethiopian churches, and its Axumite
terrace foundation of the second to
sixth centuries is clearly visible.
The stelae at Axum were probably
erected as memorials, as dwelling-
places for the spirits of departed
personages of importance. Many have
window and door motifs cut in low
relief, comparable to the fenestration
and portal designs of palaces of the
period. The palaces were vast in
extent, several stories high, and were
perhaps comparable to similar struc¬
tures in the Arab peninsula across
the Red Sea, past as well as present.
The foundations of many palatial and
religious structures of the Axumite
period show a sophisticated use of
stone construction without mortar,
angles re-inforced with larger stones,
and rhythmic uses of receding and
projecting planes in the wall surfaces.
To reach Lalibela one flies over the
massive stone "needles" rising in the
mountainous landscape, on which
political prisoners were isolated. It is
easy to see that they could never get
down. The unbelievable aspect is
how anybody ever got up to the tops
of these shafts that seem to rise 300
or 400 feet vertically up, with no visible
slope for ascent. Yet from the plane
one sees on the top of one of them
various walls and the ruins of a vaulted
house. From the airstrip terminal the
town of Lalibela is 40 minutes away
by Land Rover, crossing one of the
most magnificent changing landscapes
of mountains and valleys in the world.
T
HE town is large, and noted
for its two-story circular dwellings with
thatched roofs. At the far side is a
comfortable hotel, The Seven Olives,
built a few years ago under the
direction of Princess Ruth Desta, who
also has supervised the restoration
programme of the great rock-cut
churches here, which has elicited the
interest of Unesco.
There are nine major rock-cut sub¬
terranean churches here, all under
monastic or priestly care and available
for visits. The Christian faith of
course is the Orthodox Ethiopian
branch, akin to the Coptic, and has
been the religion of the country since
the fourth century.
These fantastic structures are cut
from the living rock, their tops level
with the hills, and surrounded by deep
rock-cut trenches to free them, and for
passage and access. They are
connected by long tunnels in the rock,
deep dark passages with crude stairs.
The rock cuttings, tunnels, and ditches
are sometimes 100 feet down from
the surface.
A major campaign for restoration
is in progress, involving hundreds of
labourers under the expert direction of
two Italian superintendents. The
cement for repairs is made of broken-
up and pulverized local stone, so it
will be the same colour as the original,
rather red. Some of the churches
have developed bad cracks. The
stone "roofs" of some have weathered
badly, scaling, so that water tends to
seep through. But a new water¬
proofing is being applied that will
render the roofs impermeable.
At Gondar the palaces are clustered
in a walled compound in the centre
of the city; a number of beautiful
eighteenth century country residences
and churches are in the nearby country¬
side. One of these suburban areas is
Kusquam, where one sees the ruins
of a handsome eighteenth century
country palace of Queen Mentuab.
UCH of the principal recep¬
tion room remains red stone dressed
trim around the three arched door¬
ways, lions and crosses in relief on the
facade, remains of several stories and
many adjacent buildings, with corner
circular towers, for little private
rooms, not stairs. Stairs were always
in a rectangular stair-tower. There
are exposed wooden floor beams
inside and frequent balcony beams
outside. This is sophisticated archi¬
tecture, done by and for the Ethiopian
rulers who were enlightened patrons
of the art of' architecture.
In town, the Gondar palaces are
empty today, and the visitor is free
to wander through the deserted halls,
climb to the roofs of some, and
recreate in his imagination the tur¬
bulent life and excitement of three
hundred years ago. The crenellated
wall of the compound has several
gates, and remains of 20 or so
buildings, several of which have been
restored.
The principal palace is seventeenth
century, three stories and towers, with
provision for roof-living. A nearby
palace (of Yasu the Great, 1682-1706),
is very like the country palace at
Kusquam. Several other luxurious
buildings are scattered through the
compound, including an elaborately
decorated pavilion of Queen Mentuab,
with windows having a series of
receding lintels and enframements.

Versailles! It was built by King
Bakaffa, 1719-1730.
Far earlier than these palaces, and
indeed long ante-dating the second-
century Axumite remains, are the
discoveries of early man, coming to
light in the Awash River Valley and
farther south in the Orno area.
Hundreds of sites are yielding stone
tools and other evidences of primitive
habitation. A four-nation expedition
earlier this year, composed of
Ethiopian, Kenyan, French, and Amer¬
ican scientists, has shown that
primitive man and homonids probably
arose in this rich section of Africa.
The Ethiopian range of antiquities
is indeed great. A recent Unesco
study, released last June (1), had for
its purpose the unification of all
branches of research concerning the
past, so that the country's excavation
programmes (by both Ethiopian and
foreign archaelogists) can be cor¬
related with an expanding museum

be co-ordinated with an expanding
programme of archaelogical studies at
the Haile Selassie I University.
Two learned journals published
in Ethiopia, Annales d'Ethiopie
and Cahiers de l'Institut Ethiopien
d'Archéologie, share with the scholarly
world the secrets of Ethiopia's in¬
credibly magnificent past. This is now
also becoming more and more
accessible because of the country's
tourist facilities that are so ably
developed by the Ethiopian Tourist

Announcement
to our readers
Repeated rises in production and
distribution costs have made una¬
voidable an increase in the "Unesco
Courier" subscription rates. The
new rates, applicable as of January
1, 1968, will be announced in our
next issue. Subscriptions and re¬
newals transmitted to Unesco before
December 31, 1967 (date of post¬
mark) will be accepted at the old
rates.

Canadian paper for African
adult education
Canada has provided 160 tons of
newsprint for adult education in East
Africa. It is being used to produce books
and other reading material for literacy
projects. Textbooks made from the news¬
print are already in use in Kenya where a
literacy campaign for the Masai people has
been launched.
Cannons and steambaths
welcome young tourists
A new international youth centre was
opened recently by the "Sputnik" Soviet
Tourist Office in the picturesque setting
of an old Russian fortress at Rostov-
Yaroslavski, on the banks of Lake Nero,
north-east of Moscow. New arrivals are
welcomed with a salvo from the ancient
brass cannons and receive traditional
Russian hospitality during their ten-to-
twelve day stay. Guests are not deprived
of modern comforts: those who find the
rigours of the old Russian steambath in
the presbytery washroom too much for
them can take a shower.
U.N. training
for African air staff
An East African School of Aviation is to
be developed in Nairobi, Kenya, under an
agreement between the U.N. Development
Programme and the governments of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania. The project is being
supervised by the International Civil Avia¬
tion Organization.

Unesco publishes Apartheid Report
Unesco has just published its Report on the effects of Apartheid on Education,
Culture, Science and Information in South Africa (1). Prepared by Unesco at the
request of the United Nations Special Committee on the Policies of Apartheid in
South Africa, the report terms the situation in South Africa "alarming" and describes
in detail how discrimination in the areas studied contributes to maintain an ideology
which it says is "unnacceptable to the world of today". (In its March 1967 issue
on Apartheid, the "Unesco Courier" published advance excerpts from the report.)
Publication in book form in English and French versions is timed to coincide with
the submission of the report to the present session of the U.N. General Assembly.
Unesco drew up the report with the assistance of Folke Schmidt, of the University
of Stockholm (chief consultant), and with the collaboration of J. P. Clark, Nigerian
poet and playwright, of the University of Lagos, Prof. P. Sherlock, Vice-Chancellor
of the University of the West Indies and Prof. F. Terrou, of the Institut Français de
Press, Paris. Its stated object is "to confront the policies and practices of the
Government of South Africa in the fields of education, science, culture and
information with a number of international norms of conduct to which Unesco is
legally and morally' dedicated".
(I) "APARTHEID, its Effects on Education, Culture, Science and Information", 224 pp.,
($1.50; 81- stg.; 5.50 F.). Order from any bookseller, or direct from a Unesco national
distributor (see page 43).
