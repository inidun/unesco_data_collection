A problem as old as mankind, the abuse
of drugs has taken on new dimensions
in recent times. Most countries have
now taken steps to combat the non¬
medical use of opium, cannabis, coca
and their derivatives (morphine, heroin,
hashish, cocaine and other drugs). But
fresh problems have arisen today with
the appearance of a wide range of
synthetic drugs, from certain tranquillizer
pills to "mind-changing" hallucinogenic
drugs such as LSD. Cover photo

The abuse of drugs
-a growing menace
s
4
OCIETIES in all parts of the world have
discovered substances which can alleviate pain and
relieve various symptoms and which also give plea¬
surable sensations when consumed.
Some of the more important of these substances
are opium, from the opium poppy; the leaf of the coca
bush, which contains the active principle of cocaine;
and the tall weed cannabis or Indian hemp, whose
preparations are known variously as marijuana,
hashish or bhang and by many other names. The
medical value of opium is so high that this drug has
been a boon to humanity to the present day; coca
and cannabis, on the other hand, while they once
had medical uses, have become relatively obsolete.
However, all these substances are dangerous
because they share the quality of giving temporary
euphoria and contentment; one can develop a craving
for them in a short time that leads to complete
dependence. It is this dependence which causes
obvious harm to the user and society. Today, the
abuse of cannabis is more widespread than that of
any other substance under international control.
In recent years, however, we have witnessed the
appearance and increasing resort to new stimulants,
new sedatives and new hallucinogenic substances.
The U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs, in an official
report prepared in January 1968, pointed to the grow¬
ing danger of these psychotropic substances not
under international control barbiturates, certain tran¬
quillizers, amphetamines (or "booster" drugs) and
"psychedelic" or hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD.
The non-medical consumption of these substances,
the report stated, has already become a "serious
social and public health problem in a number of coun¬
tries and is tending to assume increasing proportions
in others." It foresaw the growth of the problem
and the possibility that "epidemic abuse will clearly
be a very real danger in countries which are unpre¬
pared to meet it."
Until the end of the nineteenth century, the question
of narcotic drugs was not widely regarded as an
international problem calling for concerted action on
a world-wide scale. The trade in narcotic products
was viewed as a more or less legitimate business
and the misuse of dependence-producing substances
such as opium, coca leaf and Indian hempwas
believed to originate in deeply ingrained habits of
the populations of certain countries.
Prior to multilateral co-operation in the field of
narcotics control early in this century, several bilateral
treaties curbing the imports of narcotics into Far
Eastern countries had been concluded by certain
powers with political and trade interests in the area,
but essentially the problem was considered a domes¬
tic one, which could be solved within the limits of
national jurisdiction.
Developments in the latter part of the nineteenth
century, however, gave a new dimension to the
problem. First, through technological progress, labo¬
ratories began producing from opium and coca leaves
an increasing number of alkaloids and their deriva¬
tives. Further, expansion of transport and inter¬
national trade reduced geographical distances and
natural barriers between nations until what originally
seemed to be a local problem of a few countries
became a matter of concern to the world community
as a whole. Moreover, the association of traffic in
narcotics with misery and crime contributed to a
growing conviction that the sale of drugs could no
longer be viewed as a simple commercial transaction,
free from government interference.
Attempts at collective efforts by governments to
deal with this menace to health and social order were
backed by enlightened public opinion and by an
interest in self-protection on the part of those who
became aroused by a danger to which they had
previously thought themselves immune.
The reasons which led to the establishment of a
system of universally applied control over narcotic
drugs were humanitarian rather than economic or
financial. In the general interest of mankind, govern¬
ments freely consented to limit their own freedom
of action and to give an account of their activities
in the field of narcotic drugs to international organs
originally created within the framework of the League
of Nations and now operating under the United
Nations.
Addressing the U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs
in January 1968, Pier Spinelli, Director-General of the
United Nations Office in Geneva, reported that the
abuse of narcotics had assumed epidemic proportions
and that more people especially young ones were
questioning the justification of the struggle against
drug addiction and notably against the abuse of
cannabis. Appropriate action was necessary, he said,
to counter such attitudes.

THE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL
OF NARCOTICS
by Vladimir Kusevic
INTERNATIONAL co-opera¬
tion in the control of narcotic drugs
has its origins' in the movement that
sprang up at the end of the last century
for nations to work together in several
economic and social domains, in the
wake of the principal effort to regulate
political differences by peaceful means.
In the 60 years since the first formal
attempt was made to circumscribe the
dangers that lie in non-medical use
of a drug like opium, the world
has reached a situation > today in
which governments have progressively
accepted limits on their sovereignty
in the common interest of them all.
The problem of narcotics control is
such that it makes wide co-operation
almost imperative. Lack of co-opera¬
tion in the field of narcotics control
could bring social degeneration and do
immediate mental and physical damage
to hundreds of thousands of people.
Opium, one of the most important
narcotic drugs, contains as alkaloids
not only morphine, which is among the
strongest of analgesics but also
codeine, which is the essential part of
most cough medicines, or anti-tussives,
sold in the world.
The great beneficial qualities of
narcotic drugs, whether analgesic or
anti-tussive, require that the drugs be
available to all those who, in the
opinion of their doctors, are in need
of them.
Narcotic drugs, however, also have
the harmful quality of producing drug-
dependence (addiction). A very small
proportion of persons who are drug-
dependent reach -the state out of
medical treatment during which they
are administered narcotic drugs in such
doses that they become dependent and
continue wanting to take the drugs
even after the medical need has
passed.
However, most of the drug-
dependence in the world has nothing
to do with medical use: persons started
taking drugs for a combined sense of
pleasure and well-being or to escape

VLADIMIR KUSEVIC Is director of the
Division of Narcotic Drugs (United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs),
In Geneva. He was formerly head of the
Pharmaceutical Service at the Yugoslav
Ministry of Public Health in Belgrade, and
later directed the Institute of Research and
Control of Medicines in Zagreb. A former
member of the Yugoslav National Commis¬
sion on Narcotics, he was also, from 1959
to 1967, a member of the U.N. Drug Super¬
visory Body.
from psychological or other problems
besetting their lives. The state of
drug-dependence can arise very soon
after the first administrations of the
drug; the need for the drug becomes
irresistible and it is taken in increasing
doses. The drug addict is led into an
artificial world in which his life centres
round obtaining and using the drug.
He progressively loses contact with
reality and his function in society is
impaired.
Heroin, made by the conversion of
morphine, is the most dangerous of
the drugs obtained from opium and
the abuse of heroin is a serious
problem in some countries.
The experience of the last century
with opium, with heroin between the
World Wars and with heroin and the
new drugs today, have shown again
and again that narcotics control must
be international.
This realization which dawned at the
turn of the century was progressively
reinforced, and given expression in
formal treaties binding all governments
to take measures to ensure that drugs
were available only for medical and
scientific use, and prohibited for non¬
medical use.
T
HE responsibilities impos¬
ed by treaty must, of course, be con¬
ditioned by the roles that different
countries play in the production,
manufacture or use of narcotic drugs
and substances. If a country produces
raw narcotics opium', cannabis or
coca leaf the treaties require that
such production be organized in a way
that the narcotic substances cannot
find their way into illicit channels.
The same responsibility is imposed
upon governments which manufacture
narcotic drugs, either from the natural
substances for example, morphine
from opium or cocaine from the coca
leaf or manufacture other narcotic
drugs such as pethidine or methadone
by processes of chemical synthesis.
These two aspects of international
control are specific to producing and
also manufacturing countries.
The third aspect is common to all
countries since all are medical con¬
sumers of narcotic drugs: this aspect
requires that the arrangements under
which narcotic drugs are traded or
supplied for medical purposes be
under such control that they cannot
be put to illicit use in the country
itself, and also that they cannot be
diverted to supply illicit requirements
in another country.
These controls were developed step
by step through nine conventions and
protocols dating from 1912 down to
1953. This corpus of international
treaties progressively refined and
strengthened controls on production,
manufacture and licit supply, and at
the same time it laid down lines for
combatting both drug addiction and the
illicit traffic in narcotic drugs which
sought to maintain this social ill. In
1961 the last of the narcotics treaties
was adopted, the Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs, with the purpose
of simplifying the treaty provisions,
and replacing the older treaties.
An examination of this treaty gives
a comprehensive idea of all aspects of
international narcotics control. Taking
them one by one, it is seen for
example that countries which produce
opium are required to set up a state
monopoly or equivalent administration
which would license opium cultivation
and take delivery of all the opium
harvest.
As regards manufacture, the Single
Convention has provisions which
include, for example, that a concern
wishing to manufacture a drug
controlled by the Convention shall
obtain permission to do so, the
premises in which the manufacture
takes place shall be licensed, and in
addition that manufacturers shall
receive periodical authorization spe¬
cifying the kind and the amount of
drugs which they shall manufacture.
On the supply side, a cardinal
requirement is that any export and
import of narcotic drugs be specifically
authorized by the governments of both
sides in terms of the drug, the quantity
and the period by which the transaction
shall be completed.
The production, manufacture and
international trade in narcotic drugs is
supervised by an international body,
the International Narcotics Control
Board. The Board is elected by the
United Nations Economic and Social
Council.
Apart from controlling production,
manufacture and international trade,
the Single Convention requires that all
transactions in narcotic drugs on the
national plane are also restricted to
medical and 'scientific purposes.
Governments are required to ensure,
for example, that the trade in drugs
is conducted by wholesale and retail

DRUG
PRODUCING
PLANTS
From these four plants come
the main "natural" narcotic
drugs. They are cannabis,
from which hashish and
marijuana are prepared;
the poppy plant, which gives
opium and its derivatives,
morphine and heroin; the coca
bush, from whose leaves
cocaine is made; and the
Mexican Peyote cactus
(its hallucinogenic properties
were known to the Aztecs,
and it is still used in America).
Chemists recently isolated
mescalin from the roots
of this cactus and now produce
it synthetically for use
in psychotherapy.

establishments which are duly autho¬
rized; in the case of most drugs no
retail supply or issue is permitted
except against a medical prescription.
Arrangements are set out to ensure
that stocks held by traders or other
establishments are checked from time
to time, and prescriptions are matched
against quantities actually moved in
retail distribution.
The control on licit supply and
demand is completed by measures
against illicit supply and demand: the
Convention seeks the provision of
facilities for the medical treatment, care
and rehabilitation of drug addicts, and
sets down requirements of adminis¬
tration, international co-operation,
legislation and penal action in respect
of illicit traffic in narcotic drugs.
Governments are required to report
annually, in detail, to the Secretary-
General of the United Nations on the
narcotics situation in their territory and
keep him informed, for example, of
cases of illicit traffic.
Thus the treaty control extends from
the difficult aspect of controlling
agricultural production to the com¬
plexities of tightly supervising manu¬
facture in factories, proceeding there¬
from to meticulous checks on how the
drugs produced move through licit
channels to supply medical needs, and
includes attention to treating drug
addiction and combatting illicit traffic.
It is interesting to note that while the
philosophy of the Convention is
absolute i.e. to limit narcotic drugs to
medical and scientific use, transitional
concessions are made by the treaty in
respect of those countries where
the non-medical and quasi-medicai
use of opium and the non-medical use
of cannabis and coca leaf are practices
that have been ingrained for
centuries. The governments con¬
cerned in these cases have been
allowed a lapse of time during which
they undertake to put an end to such
uses by progressively restricting the
supply for such purposes.
The procedure for bringing new
drugs under control is that the World
Health Organization makes an expert
assessment of the danger of abuse
liability and ill-effects that the d-ug
presents, and recommends that it be
put under the appropriate control
regime of the Convention.
This recommendation is subject to
acceptance by the United Nations
Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which

CONTROL OF NARCOTICS (Continued)
is the international policymaking body
in this field, under the Economic and
Social Council. The Division of
Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations
Secretariat in Geneva, as part of its
duties, makes studies for the
Commission, and follows up decisions
and recommendations that the latter
adopts at its annual sessions.
In the last years a new danger has
appeared abuse of certain substances
which had hitherto not been abused
or were not known. These substances
are psychotropic (other than narcotics)
which have a stimulating or depressing
effect on the central nervous system1
or create hallucinations; among them
are included barbiturates, amphe¬
tamines, tranquillizers and hallu¬
cinogens. LSD belongs to the last-
mentioned group and seems to be as
dangerous as and even more dan¬
gerous in its effects than any of the
narcotic drugs including heroin.
These substances were outside the
scope of the Single Convention and
the earlier narcotics treaties but as
the problem of their abuse became
widespread the international bodies
have closely considered how the
problem could be resolved.
In the first instance recommendations
were made both by WHO and by the
U.N. bodies to put these substances
under national controls such as
limitation of manufacture and distri¬
bution. In spite of these recom¬
mendations, the problem has grown
apace, and it has become evident in
the last two or three years that more
international action is required which
will bind governments to apply
appropriate control measures.
The majority view seems to be that
the nature of the substances is so
diverse and the problems they pose so
variable, in gravity and manageability,
that the Single Convention conceived
for the established narcotic drugs
would not be suitable.
On the whole, it appears that a new
treaty instrument may have to be
adopted, but the final decision on this
point will be taken by the Commission
on Narcotic Drugs in the coming year
or two. However, it is clear that the
lacuna in international narcotics control
through which these substances have
been available for misuse is now
likely to be closed.
Narcotics problems are not static
and in the experience of more than
half a century their nature, incidence
and gravity has changed from time to
time and country to country.
Given the international machinery
established to oversee the manage¬
ment of the problem on a world¬
wide basis, and with reasonably
efficient administration and laws on the
national plane, every possibility now
exists for restricting the abuse of
dangerous drugs while allowing their
full and- increasing use for scientific
and medical purposes, as more of the
world's peoples come to enjoy the
benefits of modern therapy.
THE POPPY
OF SLOW DEATH
The majority of the world's opium
poppies, like this crop being
harvested in Laos, are grown in
Asia. Since opium is legally
cultivated in many countries for
medicinal purposes, the illicit growth
of the poppy is extremely difficult
to track down. The world's legitimate
needs in opium are estimated at
800 tons a year, whereas some
2,000 tons are actually harvested.
Thus 1,200 tons are diverted to
illicit use in the international
traffic in opium.

CCORDING to legend,
the opium poppy was born on the
very spot where Buddha's eyelids fell
when he cut them off to prevent sleep
from overtaking him. But the pharma¬
cological properties of the poppy and
its product, opium, were certainly
known long before then.
MARCEL GRANIER-DOYEUX is vice-pre¬
sident of the International Narcotics Control
Board and a member of the World Health
Organization consultative group on depen¬
dence-producing drugs. Professor Granier-
Doyeux is head of the Department of Phar¬
macology and Toxology at the Central Uni¬
versity of Venezuela, in Caracas, president
of the Venezuelan National Academy of
Medicine, and a member of the Pan-Amer¬
ican Academy of the History of Medicine.
Sumerian tablets (3-4,000 B.C.)
mention the poppy. Assyrians, Egyp¬
tians and Greeks have left us written
evidence of the use of opium in
bygone ages.
According to another legend, which
Homer recounts in his Odyssey, the
beautiful Helen,, wife of Menelaus,
offered to Telemachus a philter called
"nepenthes" "a potion to lull pain
and bring forgetfulness of sorrow."
But it was Hesiod (8th Century B.C.)
who left the first written mention of
the poppy in indicating the existence
near Corinth, Greece, of the town of
Mekone (town of the poppy).
The Greek historian Herodotus
spoke of the therapeutic use of opium
as did Hippocrates, the wise doctor
of Cos. From Aristotle to Virgil and
Pliny the Elder, numerous authors of
Greek and Roman antiquity mention
both the poppy and opium in their
writings.
Certain historians claim that Avi-
cenna, the great Arab philosopher and
doctor, died from opium intoxication
in 1037 in Persia. In a book published
in 1946 {Opium, Vigot Frères, Paris),
Ihno J. Bensussan suggests that
opium was probably introduced to
India in the 8th Century, after the
Arab invasion in the province of Sind.
But two Greek specialists, P.G. Kri- _
tikos and S.P. Papadaki, declared D
more recently (U.N. Bulletin on Nar- *»
cotics, Nos. 3 and 4, 1967) that the
technique of opium extraction could

FROM OPIUM TO LSD (Continued)
already have been introduced to India
twelve centuries earlier by the armies
of Alexander the Great. If we study
the first references to the cultivation
of the opium poppy in India, we find
that it is situated in the 15th Century,
as mentioned in the records of the
reign of the Mogul Emperor Akbar
the Great.
One of the first medicinal prepara¬
tions with an opium base is believed
to have been laudanum paracelsi,
prescribed In the 16th century by the
Swiss Doctor Paracelse; but the pre¬
sence of opium in this medicine has
been contested. Thomas Sydenham,
the well known English doctor of the
17th century, invented a special pre¬
paration of opium and gave his name
to a new laudanum.
However, it was not until the begin-
ing of the 19th century that the first
opium alkaloid morphine was disco¬
vered and isolated, and this discovery
is sometimes attributed to the German
pharmacist Friedrich Sertürner and
sometimes to the French chemist
Armand Seguin.
While the medicinal virtues of
opium have been recognized almost
since time immemorial, when no other
means were known for calming phys¬
ical pain, its improper use in later
years turned it into a veritable poison.
It is difficult, to say precisely when
the habit of opium smoking first
appeared, but some believe it dates
from the end of the 17th century.
The practice seems to have been
introduced in China from two direc¬
tions from Java and Formosa in the
East, and from India in the West.
The first "Opium War" (1839-42)
which brought Great Britain and China
into conflict as the result of the Chi¬
nese Government's decision to forbid
the importation of opium, can well be
considered as the beginning of the
spread of opium addiction in that
country, which soon took on tremen¬
dous proportions.
Imperial China sank into a kind of
lethargy. Drug addicts could be
counted in millions and their number
increased continuously until 1906. In
that year, an Imperial edict was
issued forbidding, progressively, the
growth of the poppy and the use of
opium.
Three years later an International
Opium Commission met in Shanghai
and was attended by representatives
from 13 countries. This was the first
serious international move to deal
with the harmful effects of opium.
Like an epidemic, opium addiction
was spreading its harmful effects over
a large part of Asia, particularly among
the most underprivileged peoples,
and it was gaining the West.
Opium can be drunk or eaten but
it is generally smoked. Opium smok¬
ing is a fairly complicated operation
which takes a lot of preparation and
equipment. Generally the pipe is
made of a bamboo stem with a clay
^
THE OPIUM POPPY
IN ANTIQUITY
Recent research by two Greek scientists,
P.G. Kritikos and S.P. Papadaki, has
shown that the opium poppy was known
and widely used as a decoration in the
Ancient World. It figures on many objects
such as statues, brooches, pendants, coins
and utensils, unearthed in the Eastern Med¬
iterranean (Ancient Greece, Egypt, Rome,
etc). Poppy capsules (above) are repro¬
duced as a decoration (left) to adorn the
hair of a Minoan goddess a figurine made

bowl. The smoker lies down. With
a needle, he takes from a box of
opium a little lump of chandu which
is a specially prepared opium extract.
The chandu is then dried over the
flame of a lamp and rubbed between
thumb and index finger into a ball
which is then placed in the bowl.
The pipe is ready. The smoker lights
it and slowly inhales the smoke.
But poor smokers cannot afford
refined chandu. They use the left¬
overs of rich smokers, the dross,
which contains highly toxic substan¬
ces. And the very poor are reduced
to the dross of dross!
Prolonged use of opium will lead
the smoker to the final stage of stu¬
por, severe loss of weight and even
death. The capacity for work is
greatly reduced among heavy smokers
and their physical condition deterio¬
rates rapidly.
To satisfy their craving, poor smo¬
kers spend a large part of their wages
on the drug and deprive themselves
of everything else. As they become
utterly impoverished they find the
drug is their only consolation, and
the vicious circle is complete.
Intoxication by sub-cutaneous or
intravenous injection of the natural
alkaloid derivatives of opium (princi¬
pally morphine and codeine) is by
far the most serious form of chronic
intoxication.
Heroin, a semi-synthetic derivative
of morphine, is an even more dan¬
gerous substance than the natural
extracts of opium. It can be inhaled,
smoked or taken as an injection. A
particularly toxic mixture is that of
heroin and cocaine, known as a
"speedball", whose use was once
common in America.
The synthesis of a number of anal¬
gesics which substitute for morphine,
complicates still further the problem
of drug addiction and the fight against
drugs which, by their repeated use,
produce "dependence". These new
drugs are usually injected, but some
produce their effect when simply
swallowed.
"Some people think", states a
report of the United Nations Commis¬
sion on Narcotic Drugs, "that a per¬
son is free to poison himself if he
wishes to and that any effort by
society to prevent the addict from
taking his drugs is an infringement
on individual liberty. This, or course,
is an indefensible concept in a
modern society, in which an addict
not only destroys himself but is likely
to harm others in the process."
The coca leaf
and cocaine
The coca leaf is associated with
an ancient legend which comes from
the Cordillera of the Andes. Khunu,
God of thunder, lightning and snow,
angered by the Yunga chiefs who
allowed their people to burn the
forests, resolved to punish them. The
smoke from the fire had blackened
his palaces, the lllimani and the Muru-
rata two high snow capped moun¬
tains in Bolivia. He decided to isolate
them from the capital built on the
shores of the Sacred Lake (Lake Titi¬
caca, on the border between Peru
and Bolivia).
Thus out off from all communication
with the mallcos (supreme chiefs) and
from their main sources of food, the
Yungas were forced to lead a nomadic
existence and suffered from thirst and
hunger. It was then that they disco¬
vered the coca leaf. Chewing the
leaves gave them renewed strength,
diminished fatigue and enabled them
to reach Tiahuanaco without suffering
from mountain sickness.
Studies made by Dr. Medrano (of
Cochabamba, Bolivia) seem to prove
that coca originated in the region of
Machu Yunga, in the former High Peru
(now Bolivia). According to a theory
which has been accepted by many
authors, the Arawaks learned the use
of coca from their conquerors, the
Chibchas.
After their migration across the
Andes, they spread the custom of
chewing coca leaves in regions which
are today Peru and Bolivia. In the
course of their migrations, the Chib¬
chas, Aymarás and Quetchuas are
thought to have propagated the grow¬
ing of the coca leaf, and this later
spread to Central America, the West
Indies and the Northern part of South
America.
m ix
T,HE Inca, Mayta-Capac
(1230 AD), and one of his successors,
Rocca (who died in 1315) are very
probably responsible for spreading the
use of coca. Yahuar-Huacac (who
died in 1347) discovered in his
conquests, regions where the Indians
worshipped coca as a divinity. The
use of the coca leaf was widespread
among the Incas by the end of the
14th century.
In 1857, Karl von Scherzer brought
back from a trip to Peru some coca
leaves which were given to the
research laboratory run by the Ger¬
man chemist Friedrich Wohler and
analyzed by Albert Niemann, who iso¬
lated from them an alkaloid cocaine.
This natural product was the first local
anaesthetic used in medicine.
The coca leaf has had many defen¬
ders, but even more detractors. The
controversy still goes on. Carlos
Gutierrez Noriega of Lima and his
school have proved the harmful effect
of chewing coca leaves.
Cocaism, as the habit of chewing
coca leaves is called, is entirely dif¬
ferent from cocainism which is the
consumption of cocaine extracted

FROM OPIUM TO LSD (Continued)
The sacred mushrooms
visit the laboratory
from the leaf. Cocaine can be taken
by inhalation, or by sub-cutaneous
injection; some cocaine addicts inject
it into their veins, either pure or
mixed with heroin the "speedball"
referred to earlier. But cocaism is by
far the more widespread. It affects
a vast number of persons in the
Andean Cordillera.
The coquero or chewer of coca
leaves, does not really chew the
prepared "quid" (chique); to extract
the juice, he sucks it, moves it around
in his mouth and wedges it between
teeth and cheek. An inveterate coca
chewer can easily be recognized by
the deformed shape of his cheek
produced by this habit.
To extract the active ingredient of
the leaves by chewing, a strongly
alkaline substance must be added and
this is provided by quick-lime, the
ashes of quinua (an Andean cereal)
or a calcareous powder obtained from
crushed shells.
T

HE harmful effects of
chewing coca leaves have been clearly
established by the Commission of
Enquiry appointed by the United
Nations in 1949, and of which the
author of this article was a member.
Cocaine, the active constituent of
coca, causes well established changes
in the intellectual faculties of the
person who habitually chews the leaf
of this plant. Numerous studies and
particularly those of Gutierrez Norie¬
ga, have focused attention on the
serious difficulties which cocaism
creates for education.
Let me quote an example: "These
difficulties begin in the home; parents
who chew coca are not interested in
sending their children to school and
even force them to. acquire the habit
of this drug. The majority of the
teachers in rural schools in Cuzco
and Puno have told us that children
with the coca habit have a very limit¬
ed capacity for learning or are not
interested in being educated. They
add that such children are very shy,
introverted, lacking in will power, and
with little inclination to play..."
There is without doubt a connexion
between cocaism and illiteracy. A
statistical study shows that the per¬
centage of illiterates in different re¬
gions is closely related to the quan¬
tity of coca leaves consumed.
Moreover, even if it could be claim¬
ed that the coca leaf has nutritive
value, under no circumstances can it
be regarded as a substitute for a
proper diet. By deadening the feeling
of hunger, it creates a vicious circle
leading to a constant state of malnu¬
trition.
It has never been scientifically
proved that coca chewing is a useful
factor, still less a necessary one, in
acclimatization to life at high altitudes.
Nor is there any good reason for
supposing that cocaine acts in a
different way on persons living at
high altitudes or produces a different
effect upon them. Cocaism which
affects millions of human beings in
South America, is a habit which is
harmful to the individual who practi¬
ses it and, in many cases, to the
community.
The coca chewer has generally a
reduced output of work. He lacks the
ability to undertake a job which requi¬
res concentration and skill; he is
incapable of assuming responsibility;
more prone to accidents at work. If
one adds to this the damage done by
the leaf to the coca chewer's health
and that of his children, one can
easily see the harmful^ effects of coca
on the economy.
Cocaism is not an isolated pheno¬
menon. It is the result of a series
of unfavourable social, economic,
cultural and hygienic factors.
Any campaign against cocaism the
ancient vice of the New World has
to take into account the need to
improve social and economic condi¬
tions, to provide better and more
extensive education, to raise stan¬
dards of health, to improve nutrition
and working conditions, to provide
proper housing and to combat super¬
stitions and false beliefs. Finally,
there is need for an intensive educa¬
tional campaign to eradicate this inju¬
rious habit once and for all.
Some hallucinogenic drugs
The Huichol Indians from the Sierra
Madre in the West of Mexico, used
to set out on a pilgrimage every year
to collect a supply of the peyotl
cactus. They cut the head off and
dried the juicy rings in the sun. Once
dry, these slices of peyotl, also called
"mescal buds" were ready for use.
They played a very important part in
religious ceremonies.
Peyotl brought on hallucinations
which the Indians took for prophetic
visions. In the 16th Century, Fray
(Friar) Bernardino de Sahagun wrote:
"Those who eat it see things which
are frightening or laughable... This
plant gives them the strength and
courage to fight, by freeing them from
fear, thirst and hunger... It is even
believed that it protects them from
all danger..."
The particular nature of the halluci¬
nations produced by peyotl is due to
mescalin, its active constituent.
Since the 16th century, the sacred
mushrooms of Mexico and their intoxi¬
cating, narcotic effects have been
mentioned by many writers. The
Indians called them teonanacatl (flesh
of God). Eaten raw, they produce
strange hallucinatory effects, with
dreams often accompanied by hilarity,
excitement or torpor, fantastic visions
or a general feeling of well being.
Most of these hallucination-pro¬
ducing mushrooms of Mexico belong
to the psilocybe family. Prof. Roger
Heim of the Paris Museum of Natural
History, managed to grow them in a
laboratory and thus provided suffi¬
cient quantities of active substances
for analysis. This enabled Albert
Hofman, the Swiss chemist, to repro¬
duce these substances synthetically,
and notably the drug psilocybin which
is today used in psychotherapy.
Another mushroom, which grows in
many other countries, and has for
long been talked of, is gaining new
fame nowadays. This is ergot, a
fungus growth found on barley and
used by midwives in past centuries to
speed delivery. It was also the cause
of the many mass poisonings known
as "St. Anthony's Fire".
IN 1943, Albert Hofman,
who was studying the melting point
of a by-product of ergot, discovered a
strange substance. A new drug LSD
25 destined to cause a stir in the
world, was born.
Few drugs have sparked off as much
discussion and controversy or given
rise to so many misconceptions. There
is no definite proof of its therapeutic
value in medicine, whereas it does
represent a hazard to health. Those
who take it claim that it represents an
escape from the harsh reality of
everyday life, enabling them to take a
"trip," as they put it, thanks to its
"psychedelic" (consciousness-expand¬
ing) properties.
The United Nations Economic and
Social Council has recommended that
LSD be placed under special control
and that its use be restricted to
approved scientific and medical
research. Public concern has brought
the abuse of the hallucinogens (espe¬
cially LSD) in North America and
Europe to the forefront of interna¬
tional attention.
A special committee established by
the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs to study the problem of sub¬
stances not under international con¬
trol, singled out LSD "as presenting
the most acute problem and showing
signs of such spread as to demand
immediate action".

One of the great controversies of today evolves around the dangers
incurred by the use of LSD and other hallucinogenic drugs, the amphe¬
tamines and certain tranquillizers. On the following pages, the "Unesco
Courier" presents the views of three international authorities on these
questions. The authors' conclusions are based not only on their own
broad experience, but the- findings of scientific research in different
countries. Richard H. Blum is director of the Psychopharmacology
Project at Stanford University (U.S.A.). Karl Evang (page 18) is
Director-General of Public Health in Norway. Grigory Avroutski

A SCIENTIFIC APPRAISAL
RICHARD H. BLUM is director of the Psy¬
chopharmacology Project at the Institute
for the Study of Human Problems, Stanford
University, California, and lecturer at the
Center for Training in Community Psychia¬
try, Berkeley, California. A consultant to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and
to the National Institute of Mental Health,
and recently consultant to the Presidential
Commission for Law Enforcement and the
Administration of Justice, he has written
widely in a number of fields, including psy¬
chopharmacology, public health, and crimi¬
nology. His books include "Alcoholism:
Modern Psychological Approaches to Treat¬
ment" (with Eva Blum), "Utopiates: The Use
and Users of LSD-25" (with associates).
h_ SYCHOACTIVE drugs,
those pharmaceutical and naturally
occurring compounds which affect
man's mind, have long been in use.
Alcohol was the earliest known, for
it was used at least by 6000 B.C. as
hunting and food-gathering peoples
settled into agricultural pursuits in Asia
Minor and the Middle East and learned
about fermentation and storage.
Opium also has an early history,
probably being used 2000 years B.C.
in the Eastern Mediterranean.
The range of such materials used in
healing, in religion, in ceremonies and,
sometimes, socially and individually,
by Richard If. Blum
was broad. A great compendium
showing just how many naturally-
occurring drugs were used medically
in the Eastern Mediterranean area in
early times is that of Dioscorides, a
Greek herbalist living in Asia Minor
in the first century after Christ.
In mid-Asia the literature of the
Vedas contains many medicinal refer¬
ences while in China there are early
pharmacopeias attesting to the wisdom
and extent of traditional medicine there
during early civilizations.
Indeed, much of the pharmacy of
today is derived from these early begin¬
nings; it is estimated that about half

Drug dependence
Therapy for the drug-dependent
patient has two distinct phases:
getting the patient off drugs, that is,
curing him of physiological
dependence, and rehabilitating him
so that his psychological dependence
on drugs is broken and he does
not relapse after completing the
treatment. Persons with strong
habituation to drugs have to be
withdrawn gradually, yet even so
withdrawal is often a disagreeable
experience. Photos here show the
mental and physical distress of a
young woman patient whose
reactions to ungratified craving for
her habitual drug range from violent
excitability to complete prostration.
Where there is physical dependence
there are withdrawal symptoms.
Where there is no physical
dependence, there are none. Recent
studies on morphine-dependent
patients have shown that the
"withdrawal syndrome", as it is
called, may persist for up
to 30 weeks.
MIND-ALTERING DRUGS (Continued)
The revolution in psychiatry
14
of all drugs prescribed in the United
States each year contain a naturally
occurring drug as the main, or one of
the main, ingredients.
Today, however, in medical use and
in social use as well there are many
more substances available than our
ancestors would ever have imagined.
Modern substances also tend to be
much more powerful than those known
in early times. Because of the great
variety of drugs in use today, it is help¬
ful to classify them by their most likely
effects on man.
The classifications developed are
guides only, since even within the
limits of normal dosage no psycho¬
active drug affects every person the
same way and, indeed, may well affect
the same person differently from one
day to the next depending on the
person's condition and his environment.
The classifications are also limited
because most of these drugs simul¬
taneously affect humans in a variety of
ways.
Indeed, scientists are not yet aware
of all the changes in human moods,
cycles of sleep and wakefulness, sen¬
sitivity to anxiety and pain, coherence
of thought, sensory and information-
processing capacities, social capabili¬
ties, learning and memory functions,
drive and motivational' levels, and bodi¬
ly performance capacities which are
affected by any one of the psycho¬
active drugs.
Thus, one must say that the science
of psychopharmacology which has as
its goal the understanding of the
effects of mind-altering drugs what
these drugs are and what they do,
how they act on and in the body and
what other influences affect drug
outcomes is just at its beginnings.
Keeping these limitations in mind, we
can set forth the following major
groups of psychoactive drugs.
Sedatives and tranquillizers
Although alcohol and opiates were
early used as drugs to produce
relaxation and sleep, it is to Asia that
we look for the earliest application of
tranquillizers as such, drugs which
reduce anxiety and excitability. There,
and in Africa too, natural plants have
long been used whose effects include
such relief.
The first pharmaceutical tranquillizer
used in the Western countries was
derived from research in India for, be¬
ginning in 1931, Indian scientists dis¬
covered the ability of Rauwolfia to
reduce blood pressure. After using
this drug for hypertension it was dis¬
covered, in the early 1950s, that it
was very beneficial in treating mental
illness. The resulting drug, reserpine,
had been synthesized in Switzerland
beginning in 1947.
The application of this drug in the
treatment of mental disorders marked
the beginning of a psychiatric revolution
and the birth of modern psychophar
macology. The introduction of reser¬
pine was shortly followed by chlor-
promazine, another tranquillizer, and
in the intervening fourteen years from
that date, several sub-groups have
evolved. Among the tranquillizers are
some characteristically termed the
minor tranquillizers such as mepro-
bamate, diphenylmethane, and ' chlor-
diazepoxide, etc., and others termed
the major tranquillizers (chlorpro-
mazine, phenothiazine, reserpine, per¬
phenazine, etc.).
Both groups of tranquillizers have
widespread application in medical prac¬
tice. The minor tranquillizers are
often prescribed for persons who are
tense or nervous. The major ones are
used in mental hospitals where the
results over the years have been so
successful, especially in combination
with new methods of community care,
that the number of persons hospitaliz¬
ed for mental disease has dropped
markedly. Many of these released
patients are helped to live nearly nor¬
mal lives by maintaining their intake of
tranquillizers. At present, minor tran¬
quillizers account for perhaps 15 per
cent of all medical prescriptions in the
United States.
These drugs can have unexpected
and undesired effects as well. Un¬
expected idiosyncratic outcomes are
called "side" effects; usually that term
implies unpleasant or dangerous results
in the person taking the- drug. Be¬
cause we shall soon be discussing

<![CDATA[
problems in the unsupervised or social
use of drugs, it is well to note that the
minor tranquillizers have been de¬
scribed as producing emotional de¬
pendence, physiologic dependence,
and drug tolerance, all of which are
components of what used to be call¬
ed "addiction" but which is now con¬
sidered more broadly under problems
of "drug dependence" as such. The
major tranquillizers can also produce
"organic" complications, that is neuro¬
logical disorder, but do not produce
psychic not physical dependence.
The minor tranquillizers are usually
considered closely akin to sedatives
in their action and effects, although as
the names imply, the former tend to
' relax and the latter tend to produce
sleep.
Sedatives as pharmaceutical pro¬
ducts are of earlier origin than tran¬
quillizers. The barbiturates are the
group of sedatives most commonly
prescribed: these were introduced
about 1913 and at present enough are
produced to provide several dozen
doses of sleeping pills per citizen per
year in the United States. Other se¬
datives which are less widely prescrib¬
ed include the bromides, chloral hy¬
drate, glutethimide, and certain other
compounds including anti-histamines,
belladonna, aspirin, etc.
The sedatives, as their name implies,
are useful in inducing sleep or in
slowing people down, but they can
have side effects too. Barbiturates
especially are associated with physical
and psychological dependence as well
as the development of tolerance. The
bromides, although not implicated in
physical dependence, can produce
psychoses when taken in large
amounts (as can many substances)
and, like any mind-altering drug, can
be (although they rarely are) a basis
for psychological dependence. .
The sedatives, as opposed to newer
tranquillizers, appear more dangerous
in that coma and death occur more
readily with small doses, especially
if there is another drug such as alcohol
present to add to their effects. Barbi¬
turates are also described as produc¬
ing more noticeable impairments of
judgement and motor (muscular) co¬
ordination, and as being associated
more often than tranquillizers with de¬
pendency reactions and, as a conse¬
quence, with convulsions, psychosis
or death should a person be with¬
drawn from his heavy doses of the
drugs.
Stimulants and
Anti-Depressants
We can distinguish five classes of
stimulants. There are those which are
minor stimulants in widespread social
use; these include coffee, tea, khat (in
the Arabian and East African areas),
betel nut, kola, kava, the cola bever¬
ages, and chocolate and cocoa to a
very minor degree. Caffeine is also
present in non-prescription stay-awake
preparations. The drugs present few
problems with the exception of khat
about which there is some debate as
to its effects. It is our view that these
effects are minor.
A second stimulant is nicotine
which is heavily used around the
world in cigarettes, pipes, cigars, snuff,
and chewing tobacco. It is a drug
with no recognized medical use but
which in social use can easily lead
to psychological dependency and the
development of tolerance. Physical de¬
pendency is also found in that the with¬
drawal symptoms of heavy smokers
can be substantial. The long-term
effects of smoking are clearly impli¬
cated in the development of cancer,
although nicotine itself may or may not
play a role.
A third class of stimulants are the
amphetamine compounds (there are
also pipradrol and methylphenidate
types). These are widely employed
to treat narcolepsy (a compulsive
tendency to attacks of deep sleep),
to combat fatigue and depression
(sometimes effective) and to assist
obese patients in reducing (very rarely
effective). They promote alertness
and activity and, in high doses, produce
irritability, excitement and toxic psycho¬
ses. Continued use can be associated
with psychological dependence, toler¬
ance occurs, and there are some
scientists who report mild physical de¬
pendence as well. In any event, such
physical dependence as there may be
is very minor as compared with
opiates or sedatives.
Cocaine, derived from the coca leaf
chewed in the high Andes, is also a
stimulant. The coca leaf itself is an¬
algesic, reducing sensations of cold^
fatigue, pain, bad taste, or hunger.
Cocaine is used medically as a local
anesthetic though much less so than
in former years.
However, in its non-medical (and in 1 H
most countries, illicit) use it is taken
intravenously or sniffed in order to
achieve feelings of pleasure and

strength. Such use can lead to hallu¬
cinations, delusions, excitement, as
well as digestive disorders and possib¬
ly convulsions. Although very strong
psychological dependence can occur
there is no evidence for physical
dependence with cocaine.
A fifth class of stimulants are usually
termed anti-depressants and include
monoamine oxidase enzyme inhibitors
and tricyclic compounds (imipramine,
amitriptyline, etc.). These preparations
tend to reduce melancholy or chronic
depression and some, at the same time,
reduce alertness and produce confu¬
sion in thinking. There is no evidence
of dependency on these drugs develop¬
ing. The drugs are used almost ex¬
clusively in psychiatric treatment.
Hallucinogens
This classification includes quite a
range of drugs, some of which have
been used for many centuries mush¬
rooms, peyote, ergot, cannabis, and a
variety of South American plants and
some of which are dramatic recent
discoveries of which LSD-25 is the
best known.
Although the classification implies
that hallucinations are a most probable
effect, that is often not the case.
Changes in sensory experiences, eu¬
phoria, anxiety and anxiety reduction,
peculiar contradictory emotional ex¬
periences, altered perceptions of self,
increased but more narrowed alert¬
ness, reduced learning ability and, in
high doses, confusion and psychoses,
can all be outcomes.
Cannabis (marijuana, hashish) is the
substance about which there is the
most current debate, for even though
its use has been known for several
thousand years, a scientific assess¬
ment of its affects under varying con¬
ditions of dosage and administration,
or on subjects of differing nutritional
or psychological status remains to be
completed.
When used in mild doses by stable
persons, few ill effects are reported;
when used in heavier doses by mal¬
nourished or unstable persons there
are reports of bad outcomes, for exam¬
ple psychosis, apathy, and psycho¬
logical dependence.
Historically, most of the hallucino¬
gens have been employed in folk medi¬
cine, in religious ceremonies, and also
socially or by individuals to produce
altered states of consciousness or im¬
proved moods. At present cannabis
is, used in Asia in traditional medicine,
peyote and some mushrooms are em¬
ployed in healing and religion by
American Indians, and LSD and related
pharmaceutical preparations are being
tested as treatment aids for psychotic
children and for alcoholics. At the
moment, the greatest scientific poten¬
tial for the hallucinogens appears to
be in pharmacological and psycholo¬
gical research rather than in treatment
itself.
Trends in use
of psychoactive drugs
When we look at the historical
and anthropological evidence, certain
trends in the use of drugs emerge. In
the first place, almost every society
known to man and" there are only
three or four exceptions we have been
able to identify have used one or
several psychoactive drugs (alcohol
included). Secondly, small societies
or tribes which are themselves stable
or well integrated appear to use these
drugs without apparent ill effects. Use
in such settings is likely to be religious
and medical but also to be ceremonial
in the sense that drugs are foci of
attention and have symbolic value.
In spite of these "formal" purposes
in use, even in small tribes individuals
seem to enjoy drug use and to find
that drugs can alleviate distress and
facilitate sociability. Nevertheless, tri¬
bal use is almost always controlled
by custom and by the presence of
others.
As societies have become more com¬
plex, especially as agricultural societies
became urban or small tribal groups
experienced the impact (through con¬
quest) of contact with new cultures,
changes in drug use, in effects, and in
appraisals of drug significance appear.
Several thousand years before
Christ, alcohol was the first drug iden¬
tified with "abuse," which can mean
anything from moral or legal disap¬
proval of drug use to concern about
drug-induced behaviour to alarm over
damage to health.
During the period of Greek and
Roman medicine, there was awareness
of the health danger in certain drugs,
opium and hemlock for example, but
little evidence that people were taking
these dangerous substances except in
limited quantities for healing (or to
induce death as with Socrates).
The next drug to be the subject of
any public alarm was cannabis which
during the Crusaders' time became the
subject of the legend of the Assassins,
a story which held hashish capable
of making men killers. That myth is
current even now though it is unsup¬
ported by scientific evidence.
Mushrooms and ergot, a plant para¬
site, both containing alkaloids from
which modern hallucinogens have been
derived, were probably early identified
as producing illness (St. Anthony's
Fire, for example) but their use to pro¬
duce altered consciousness was not
a source of public concern until the
19th century at which time observers
of Siberian tribes using fly agaric
were alarmed about their conduct.
As for the concept of "addiction,"
that is recent, not arising until the late
18th and early 19th centuries when lite¬
rate users and curious physicians ob¬
served the effects of long-term use of
opium. Subsequent to those obser¬
vations, the potential "addicting"
qualities of other drugs were observed.
Very recently the World Health Or¬
ganization, recognizing that the con¬
cept of "addiction" has itself been
abused and is scientifically inadequate,
has recommended a new terminology
which rests upon descriptions of the
kind and quality of "dependency"
associated with drug use.
As a general statement one may
say that almost any psychoactive drug
which relieves pain, produces pleasure,
or enhances sensations or interperso¬
nal relations can become the object
of psychological dependency. Phy¬
sical dependency, which implies to¬
lerance and withdrawal symptoms,
occurs with fewer drugs but these
include barbiturates, some tranquilli¬
zers and possibly the amphetamines
as well as alcohol and opiates (nar¬
cotics).
At the present time we are wit¬
nessing the rapid introduction of new
kinds of drugs, most of which are
produced by the pharmaceutical
manufacturers, but some of which are
folk discoveries imported to the West¬
ern world.
The consumption of psychoactive
drugs is increasing rapidly. It is esti¬
mated that in the United States, for
example, enough psychoactive drugs
(excluding opiates, alcohol, etc.) are
produced to provide over 60 doses
per year per man, woman and child.
Illicit distribution and lack of ade¬
quate medical supervision constitute
a large but unknown proportion of the
use of these drugs; furthermore, in
the United States production and con¬
sumption appear to be rising at a rate
of perhaps 10 per cent per year.
Studies of normal populations show,
as would be expected, that most city
people use these . drugs, either on
tlirect prescription from physicians or
on a ho.me remedy basis. A growing
number, especially among young
people, also procure and use them
illicitly. The amphetamines, cannabis
and other hallucinogens are particu¬
larly popular in the United States.
College student studies suggest the
most common illicit pattern is experi¬
mentation and casual use rather than
any heavy use. We find so far that
something like 25 per cent of col¬
lege students have employed amphe¬
tamines, 21 per cent cannabis, and
5.6 per cent the hallucinogens.

some of which is simply inadequately

seem to use them safely; those who do
not, seem most likely to be persons al¬
ready disadvantaged by personality dis¬
order, poverty, or other forms of social
or personal deprivation or alienation.
Nevertheless, even healthy persons
from adequate social environments can
experience either immediate or long-
term ill effects from use of psycho¬
active drugs which is one reason for
calling for medical supervision and
individual caution in their use.
The extent of use and kind of prob¬
lems occurring vary from one part
of the world to another. In technolo¬
gically advanced countries the trend
toward widespread consumption of
pharmaceutical preparations typically
is accompanied by some illicit use by
a few young people; Japan, Sweden,
England and Denmark have reported
amphetamine "abuse."
Most European countries have, their
"hippies" who illicitly use cannabis and
hallucinogens as well as amphetami¬
nes; in African cities cannabis and
amphetamine use among young people
is a matter of concern, and in remoter
nations such as Nepal and Afghanistan
local authorities are worried lest their
influx of hippie tourists expose local
youth to a drug:centered life which
many people around the world would
agree is socially unproductive, psy¬
chologically limiting and which poses
health dangers.
In evaluating trends it is important
to maintain. perspective. Psychoactive
agents are medically valuable and one
must expect more of these drugs to be
discovered and prescribed. The use
of pharmaceuticals is part of urban
technological culture as is at least
some of the despair and nervousness
which they relieve. Experimentation
by youth must be considered a normal
phenomenon. It is not surprising that
such experimentation with drugs is
quite frequent where these agents are
readily available. But experimentation
is not to be confused with heavy illicit
use, as in the case of hippies, chronic
hashish eaters (or alcoholics).
The latter patterns of "abuse" will
also continue, but the goal of most
public health authorities and policy
planners is to limit them by control¬
ling production and distribution of
drugs, to restrict use to medically su¬
pervised treatment, to provide treat¬
ment facilities for those suffering ill
effects, to support research, and to
provide, through education to physi¬
cians, citizens, and growing children
knowledge of the potential benefits and
dangers of the use of any powerful
substance which affects the mind.

terrified by the tiny creature and seeks refuge in a corner. LSD causes monkeys to panic

LSD
NEW MENACE
TO YOUTH
by Karl Evang

eople who indulge in
psychedelic drugs like to claim that
LSD, mescalin, psilocybin, marijuana
and hashish fill them with joy and rap¬
ture and enrich their inner life. They
call such drug-taking a soul-revealing
experience that permits the individual
to discover new and subtler aspects of
his personality, and to distil the impres¬
sions from the external world filtering
through the effects of the drug.
The truth is that all of these substan¬
ces are dangerous. What, for example,
is their effect in biological, chemical
or medicinal terms? Are they habit
forming? Are they harmful for the body
or the mind? Do they cause mental
illness or other serious disturbances?
Can they provoke a person to committ¬
ing suicide? When questions such as
KARL EVANG is Director-General of Public
Health in Norway. This article Is based

author for the International University of
the Air, and broadcast recently by the
French radio network (ORTF) as part of
a special presentation on "psychedelic
drugs."
these are raised the problem is placed
in its proper perspective, attention is
focussed on the reactions that occur
from taking psychedelic drugs as much
as on the individual who takes them.
Many people do not fully realize that
the problems raised by psychedelic
drugs not only directly affect the indi¬
vidual who takes them, but have much
wider, social consequences. Man is
not simply a two-dimensional being
made up of just a body and a mind.
This becomes much more obvious when
a person falls ill, and the third dimen¬
sion his role in society is clearly
affected.
Human beings cannot function in
isolation, for isolation is tantamount
to stagnation, the death of the spirit,
the destruction of the body. Man is
the product of his environment, for
the most part, and is entirely depen¬
dent on the impressions and stimuli
that reach him from the world around
him. And as the great Pavlov rightly
put it, man is a being made up of
reflexes.
The World Health Organization has
clearly stated that any evaluation of
the effects of psychedelic and similar
drugs that does not take into account
all aspects of man is incomplete.
Psychedelic drugs, whether habit
forming or not, all seem to have one
characteristic in common in that they
weaken the need for human contact
and social relations. They lower the
overall quality and degree of social
relationships which every person as a
member of society must share. They
limit and impoverish his range of inte¬
rests, make him self-centred and a
prisoner of his own ego.
The individual loses interest in his
former friends and the life of the
community, and loses all desire to take
part in the events of his time. Nor
is there evidence of any artistic acti- .
vity being released by the use of psy¬
chedelic drugs despite the violent
sensory manifestations, including vi¬
sions and hallucinations, that are
experienced.
To justify their indulgence in psy¬
chedelic drugs the argument is often
advanced that it helps the individual
to escape from established society, to
break out of the straightjacket, to be
liberated from social conventions, to
assert his discontent at being a mere

To warn the public of the effects

known to create "illusions of

cal game of world politics", and so
on. Let us take advantage of life
they say, before it is too late. This
is all very fine but it adds up to noth¬
ing more than organized alienation
and renunciation.
The tragedy is that psychedelic drugs
find their adepts not only among young
people who have been deprived of love
and affection or. who suffer from per¬
sonality disorders, and hence present
. problems of adaptability, but also
among a portion of the youth of .today
who do not present such problems,
who are our hope for the future and
could work to build a better world
for tomorrow than the one we have
today. Luckily, the number of young
people who fall victim to these prac¬
tices is very small indeed.
What has caused concern among
public health authorities, social secu¬
rity officials, criminologists and in the
home is that these potent pharma¬
ceutical products, especially LSD, are
not subject to legislation in many
countries and are now freely used by
people who are not ill.

LSD (Continued)
20
It was not clear at first whether the
problem really merited attention, but
as the number of tragic cases increas¬
ed, the outcry became louder and
louder.
In the autumn of 1966, a special
committee set up by the Economic
and Social Council of the United Na¬
tions to deal with this question,
expressed "its deep concern over the
excessive and growing use of LSD
with its serious consequences, both
for the health and safety of the indi¬
vidual and that of society, and invites
governments to take the necessary
measures to impose strict controls on
the importation, exportation and pro¬
duction of LSD and similar products
and place the trade in this product
under the control of competent autho¬
rities."
The committee recommended that
LSD should be used only for medical
research and under strict medical
control. It urged governments to take
the necessary steps to prevent any
other use being made of this sub¬
stance. This is an unusual step to
take with regard to a pharmaceutical
product and unusually harsh language
for an International official committee.
But it is not the medical use of
LSD and similar products like psilo-
cybin, mescalin, etc. which made
these drastic measures necessary.
Over the past 20 years the use of-
the drug for medical purposes has
declined sharply. It is now limited to
the diagnosis and treatment of certain
serious nervous disorders, particularly
neuroses.
It is possible that at some future
date the use of these substances may
prove of use for patients who are too
ill to live in society and who have
had other treatments without success.
A growing number of countries
(22 as of January 1968) have taken
action on the recommendations of the
U.N. special committee and have plac¬
ed LSD in the same category as other
outlawed drugs such as marijuana,
hashish, heroin and similar substances.
This means that the unauthorized
possession, sale, distribution and use
of these drugs is illegal and punishable
by law.
Let us therefore examine the dan¬
gers that the use of LSD represents.
The effects of LSD can be divided
into four main groups, but in all of
them the reactions can occur suddenly
and within a very short time after the
drug is taken. (These effects may
occur in varying intermixture.)
In the first group, LSD stimulates a
sensation of unlimited power and
strength of virtual omnipotence. We
call this state "the megalomaniac
reaction". There is the example of
a girl of 19 who, after taking LSD,
was convinced that she could fly like
a bird. She jumped out of a window
and fell to her death. A young man
of 21 announced that all motor traffic
would respond to his command. He
stepped into the middle of the street,
raised his arm, shouting "Stop", and
was killed instantly.
In the second group, the use of
LSD has a completely opposite effect.
It produces a state of deep depression,
of despair and discouragement. The
overwhelming feeling of being worth¬
less, sinful and incompetent often leads
to suicide.
The reactions to LSD in the third
group are paranoid disorders. The
subjects surfer profound anxiety and
believe they are being threatened by
others who wish to kill them, in most
cases by persons in their immediate
surroundings. And as attack is the
best method of defence, they Often
inflict serious injuries and even go as
far as murder, in the belief that they
are defending themselves.
The fourth group of severe reactions
is characterized by a state of general
confusion, the symptoms of which
resemble mental diseases or insanity,
illusions, hallucinations, incoherence,
irrational feelings, little or no sense
of time, etc. These conditions are
usually short-lived, but can sometimes
continue for long periods. A little girl
of five lost her mind after eating a
lump of sugar which she found in the
refrigerator and on which a drop of
LSD had been placed. It took nine
months for her to regain her normal
health.
. In other words, a normal healthy
person who takes LSD runs the risk
of mental illness, of becoming funda¬
mentally irresponsible, of resorting to
murder or committing suicide.
How then can we explain the cult
of LSD and the eager publicity given
to its "prophets"?
The answer seems simple: there is
no limit to human curiosity, to the lust
for new sensations of any kind. All
of us feel more or less frustrated by
social conventions, tied to hierarchical
values not of our making which put
us in situations where we feel ill at
ease. Then there is our work which
for the most part is a dull routine.
Throughout history there have been
intoxicants to break these bonds,
either for short periods or long ones.
LSD and similar substances like
psilocybin, mescalin, Indian hemp,
and other hallucinatory drugs can free
a person from all constraints by
intoxicating the sensory faculties. For
a moment there may be a feeling of
liberation, renewal, freedom from the
bonds of life. But afterwards one
quickly finds that everything was an
illusion. Drunkenness is no liberation;
it is a dungeon immuring its prisoner.
The so-called "prophets" have pre¬
dicted that important new knowledge
concerning the human soul will come
from experiments carried out with
psychedelic drugs such as LSD. So
far nothing remotely like this has
happened. Not one single fundamen¬
tally new thing has appeared. The
only result has been to confirm the
grave dangers which the ignorant
invite when they tamper with the vol¬
cano which is the sub-conscious mind.
Tranquillizers are not narcotic drugs
but nevertheless constitute a
hazard with prolonged and
continuous use. It has been
pointed out that people who abuse
these drugs tend to rely on them
to solve their difficulties, thus
reducing their ability to react and
face up to life's everyday problems.
In many countries tranquillizers and
"pep" pilis (amphetamines) are
supplied only on medical
prescription.

T HE second half of the
20th century has seen remarkable
progress in the fields of chemistry and
pharmacology; with the advent of
antibiotics, man suddenly found himself
in possession of a wide range of
medicines for curing or alleviating the
most varied diseases.
New scientific discoveries have
enabled man to gain still more victories
over Nature. Nevertheless, repeated .
danger signals lead us to ask
ourselves today if these gigantic
forces which have been unleashed are
not slipping out of our control like
some Sorcerer's Apprentice.
The simplicity in the use of modern
drugs and their safety in terms of
secondary effects and complications
have led them to be used increasingly
for general "routine therapy", as it is
called, which patients can follow at
home for extended periods, often years,
instead of in accordance with strict
medical prescription..
Since such treatments are relatively
inexpensive and the drugs are
GRIGORY AVROUTSKI is one of the lead¬
ing psychopharmacologists in the U.S.S.R.
He is head of the Psycfiopharmacoíogíca/
Section of the Institute of Psychiatry, Mos¬
cow and author of "Contemporary Psycho¬
tropic Products and Their Use in Schizo¬
phrenia Treatment" and other works, some
of them translated in English and German.
manufactured industrially, pharmacies
are now overstocked with a multitude
of patent medicines in attractive
wrappings. The same product is
sometimes distributed under different
brand names with extravagant
advertising.
Advertising, low prices and ease of
purchase have led to the present
tendency to use drugs indiscriminately
or, in any case, more often than is
necessary. And a paradoxical phe¬
nomenon has occurred, known as
"drug dependence".
A patient suffering from a chronic
internal complaint is prescribed a
certain drug to relieve his pain and
to' be taken over an extended period.
Any attempt made to cut down on the
medication leads to worsening of his
condition and the reappearance of
morbid symptoms. This is a case of
necessary and beneficial dependence.
In another case, the medication has
done its work, the illness has receded,
but the patient continues the treatment
through fear of a relapse. This is
dependence of a different kind which
can be considered psychological and
which is more often than not harmful
to health. This dependence generally
develops among the anxiety-prone.
It can be dealt with by dissuasion, by
explaining to the patient that his
medicine is no longer needed and has,
in fact, become dangerous.
However, the situation is more
serious when dealing with so-called
psychotropic producta one of the
miracles of modern medicine, which
are used in the treatment of
psychological disorders. Some have
a sedative effect and are called
tranquillizers; others, on the contrary,
are stimulants and are referred to as
psychotonics.
Thanks to these drugs, thousands of
mental patients have been freed from
serious disturbances such as delirium,
hallucinations and depression, without
having to be confined to a psychiatric
ward. In these cases, psychological
dependence on the drug is entirely
beneficial. By constantly operating on
the organism the psychotropic drugs
help to free the patient from the
psychopathological disturbances that
imprison his mind; if these are not
completely cured, they may well
reappear as soon as the dose of the
prescribed drug is reduced.
However, in the great majority of
cases, psychotropic substances, both
tranquillizers and psychotonics, are
used by healthy persons or in cases
where doctors diagnose only minor
nervous complaints, such as fatigue,
irritability or other personality disor¬
ders; indecision, anxiety syndromes
or apathy.
In all these cases, treatment by
tranquillizers gives excellent results

"Hippy" meeting in Golden Gate
Park, San Francisco during a festival.
The unforeseen boomerang effect
22
and the symptoms disappear quickly.
In the past six or seven years sedatives
such as meprobamate, librium, valium,
trioxazine, etc., have been consumed
on an unprecedented scale. In 1963,
for example, American drugstores sold
60,775,000 units on prescription alone,
without counting those sold freely
across the counter.
There can be no doubt that
absorbing a drug which can bring
rapid, effective action against severe,
often unbearable, psychological tension
produces an impression of tremendous
relief. The patient finds that he can
face what until then had seemed
unsurmountable difficulties. It is
precisely because these drugs have
taken on the aspect of a "miracle" cure
that tranquillizers and stimulants have
come to occupy such an important
place in the rough-and-tumble pace of
modern life. It has even become
fashionable nowadays after the usual
remarks about the weather and other
no less serious topics, to ask one's
friends which brand of tranquillizer
they use.
And why not? These drugs are
supposed to be harmless and can be
taken for as long as one wants to
without any fear of secondary effects;
at least, that is what certain advertise¬
ments and some medical men say.
Helenium and librium sometimes cause
dizziness and slight difficulties in
co-ordination to be sure, but these are
only passing symptoms. '
From this it is a natural step to the
conclusion that there is no need to
submit one's nervous system to the
permanent strain created by modern
life; that there is no reason to insist
on training our will power to control
our nerves, anxiety or lack of self-
confidence since miracle products do
it all for us as if by magic.
The box of tranquillizer pills first
makes its appearance on the bedside
table; then it is carried in coat pocket
or handbag so that one can swallow
a pill just before going into the boss's
office or before facing the audience
on opening night or simply after a
family squabble.
As a rule, this is considered better
than smoking a cigarette, which is
quite true. At least it does no harm
to the lungs. But gradually the user
notices that instead of the two or
three pills a day prescribed by the
doctor, he is now taking four or six.
This indicates that the nervous system
has got used to the drug and that a
bigger dose is now needed to achieve
' the same effect.
At this point one hesitates and
begins to get pangs of conscience.
Are the pills as good as they are said
to be? And then one. remembers the
drugs which were first developed to
cure people but soon turned out to
have a boomerang effect.
This is precisely what happened with
the amphetamines, a group of drugs
widely used in the early 1950s and
which, like the tranquillizers, belong
to the psychopharmacological family,
but have a tonic or stimulating effect.
The amphetamines are "pep" pills that
stimulate physical and mental energy;
they also reduce the appetite and help
in slimming, which accounts for their
great popularity, particularly as a
result of a vast advertising campaign,
and the fact that they were once sold
without a prescription. In 1954,
200,000 persons are believed to have

used amphetamines in Japan, and the
Japanese Government finally clamped
strict medical controls on their use.
The use of amphetamines can
lead to physical and psychological
disturbances such as sharp loss
of weight, insomnia, and nervous
disorders culminating in psychosis, and
the urge to keep on taking the pills is
almost uncontrollable. In spite of the
control measures adopted, these drugs
still represent a serious danger,
especially for the young. Cases of
misuse are still as frequent as ever,
reports the World Health Organization.
Doctors and scientists have recently
renewed their campaign in medical
journals to tighten -controls and limit
the medical prescription of ampheta¬
mines. The brief history of the am¬
phetamines shows how a medical drug
which in other respects has various
valuable properties, can virtually
become a "narcotic" drug although
in fact it is not.
Amphetamines differ from narcotics
in the first place by their action, since
they are stimulants. They differ also
through their chemical structure and
pharmacological properties. It was
difficult to foresee the hidden dangers
in the use of amphetamines when
pharmacologists first suggested that
they be given to night pilots to help
combat fatigue and drowsiness. It was
only after extended and exhaustive
clinical tests that the amphetamines
revealed how dangerous they really
were. In fact, no way has yet been
found to eliminate their untoward
effects completely.
What, then, are the effects of the
amphetamines that have raised doubt
about their value?
The amphetamines are a drug that
acts principally on the nervous system.
The capacity of amphetamines to ele¬
vate mood and induce a state of well-
being is probably largely the basis for
their widespread use as stimulants.
Since this commonly involves conti¬
nuous and prolonged administration,
the users of these drugs develop
varying degrees of psychic dependence
on them.
The abuse of this class of drugs
originates in and is perpetuated by the
psychic drive to attain maximum eu¬
phoria. No physical dependence is
created. Nevertheless the sudden
withdrawal of the stimulant drug which
has masked chronic fatigue and the
need for sleep now permits these con¬
ditions to appear in an exaggerated
fashion.
Thus the withdrawal period is cha¬
racteristically a state of depression
both psychic and physical, which
probably reinforces the drive to re¬
sume the drug. In this respect, it is
much less important and does not
compare in magnitude with those that
occur with - morphine, . barbiturates,
alcohol and other drugs that create
physical dependence. Withdrawal of
drugs of the amphetamine type is
never threatening to life and requires
psychological rather than somatic
therapy.
. A unique feature of the ampheta¬
mines is their capacity to induce what
is technically known as "tolerance", a
quality possessed by few central ner¬
vous system stimulants. Tolerance
means that the individual finds that the
same quantity of drug produces less
effect or response, or to put it another
way, that larger doses are required to
produce the . same effect. This in¬
crease in dosage can eventually result
in death.
We'HAT about the tranquilli¬
zers? Is it correct to assume that they
are suspect in the same way as the
amphetamines and other narcotic drugs
now are? The answer is "No". Al¬
though certain tranquillizers definitely
have properties in common with some
narcotic drugs, they differ markedly
from the latter in that they do not in¬
duce the physical dependence and tole¬
rance characteristic of most of these
drugs. It cannot be denied, however,
that certain tranquillizers do produce
psychological dependence.
Hence we may conclude that tran¬
quillizers are quite different from nar¬
cotic drugs like marijuana, cocaine,
morphine as well as the amphetamines.
They are usefully and legitimately em¬
ployed for medical purposes in the
treatment not only of psychological and
nervous disorders but many somatic
illnesses of the so-called "neurogenic"
type, such as cardialgía (neuralgic
pains in the region of the heart) and
hypertonic diseases (high blood pres¬
sure). Such sedatives as meproba-
mate, librium and trioxazine have
proved highly -valuable and effective
in dealing with diseases of this kind.
But like all drugs, tranquillizers and
sedatives should be used with
moderation and should be used only
on a doctor's prescription.
The sense of security engendered
by the possibility of resorting to
tranquillizers results in the atrophy of
our psychological functions, weakening
will-power and character; in short,
inhibiting those aspects of our per¬
sonality which should help us to face
up to day-to-day difficulties.
The real use of tranquillizers is to
help people overcome some patho¬
logical disturbance at a certain
moment. The purpose, I repeat, is to
"help" and not to replace individual
effort. In the case of a fracture,
crutches are helpful in enabling the
bones to mend more quickly, by
supporting part of the weight and
keeping limbs immobile. But if
crutches are used permanently,
muscles which have remained in
enforced inactivitv for too long
become atrophied and the healing
process is delayed. This is equally
true of tranquillizers.
And so we find that the continued
use of tranquillizers results in psycho¬
logical dependence. People have con¬
fidence in the drug and believe that
it will help them in moments of stress
and strain. A person who makes
moderate use of tranquillizers can
usually stop taking them when he or
she decides to do so. Sometimes,
however, it is not as easy as one
believes, and psychotherapy measures
are called for.
A person who suddenly stops taking
tranquillizers after many months of
heavy dosage usually finds that the
break is accompanied by very unpleas¬
ant effects, and patients are known
to have suffered convulsions as a
result. As a general rule, however,
with moderate use, one can usually
stop taking most tranquillizers without
experiencing major difficulties, and
certainly without the pathological with¬
drawal symptoms associated with the
physical dependence produced by nar¬
cotic drugs and the psychological de¬
pendence produced by amphetamines.
For all the above reasons, it is our
opinion that tranquillizers should not
be sold freely across the counter and
should be supplied only on medical
prescription. Furthermore, in pres¬
cribing tranquillizers, the doctor should
take into consideration not only the
patient's physical and nervous tempe¬
rament but the gravity of the illness
requiring treatment.
In many countries commercial
advertising for tranquillizers is pro¬
hibited, and information regarding
these products is sent exclusively to
doctors through their specialized
journals. In these countries tran¬
quillizers are not sold without a
doctor's prescription.
The near future will no doubt bring
new achievements in pharmaceutical
chemistry, pharmacology and clinical
psychiatry, and we may then have at
our disposal tranquillizers which are
more effective and harmless. We
should like to think that progress in
this field will be properly controlled
and that tranquillizers will remain what
they are today a wonderful instrument 00
in the hands of doctors as a more ^*»
effective weapon against nervous and
psychological disorders.

INTERPOL
VERSUS THE
UNDERWORLD
OF NARCOTICS
4 «aftttM
y Jean Nepote
A
24
, BUSE of drugs is an
affliction that has plagued mankind
throughout history. It has caused
immeasurable harm in the past and
continues to do so today.
For the last fifty years nations
have been co-operating closely to
solve this problem. They have creat¬
ed and put into force a system of
treaties and regulations governing
national and international trade in
narcotics. And it has often been
suggested that the system built up
over the years could well be adopted
as a model in other fields.
But the application of national and
international control to trade in nar¬
cotics has promoted in its turn the
growth of a "black market" in these
products, an illicit traffic with which
the police forces of the world now
have to contend.
JEAN NEPOTE is Secretary-General of
Interpol (the International Criminal Police
Organization).
These are the basic facts of the
problem.
The motivations of drug addiction,
of course, are completely different
depending on whether one is consider¬
ing a heroin addict in New York or
a smoker of hashish in Africa, a
chewer of coca leaves in the Andes
or an opium addict in Hong Kong.
I do not propose to discuss the
psychological maladjustments or the
physical needs which induce a person
to abuse drugs; I wish simply to
review the present situation and to
show how efforts are being made to
deal with it.
To provide a clear picture of the
present state of drug abuse is far
from easy for, as one might imagine,
no precise figures exist of the number
of drug addicts in the world. Statis¬
tics are difficult to obtain, partly
because drug taking is a clandestine
affair and addicts do not announce
the fact to the authorities. Further¬
more many countries still lack the
administrative services which would
enable them to identify and register
drug addicts.
The number of drug addicts varies
considerably from one region of the
world to another and according to the
types of drugs employed. In North
America (U.S.A. and Canada) two
main types of drug are taken, 1)
heroin, affecting about 60,000 persons
(55,000 officially indicated in the
U.S.A. and 2,200 in Canada), and 2)
cannabis which is mostly smoked in
the form of marijuana cigarettes, par¬
ticularly in the U.S.A.
South America's chief drug is the
coca leaf, chewed by at least four
million Indians living in the Andean
Highlands; coca leaves are also used
to produce cocaine which is employed
in various parts of the world by certain
drug addicts.
In Africa, the drug most frequently
used is cannabis, and it is estimated
that the number of persons who
smoke cannabis runs into the tens of
thousands, especially in rural areas.

addiction is négligeable except for
reports of the increasing use of can¬
nabis, particularly by young people.
A number of heroin addicts have been
noted in the Federal Republic of
Germany, France, Italy and U.K., but
most of these originated with medical
treatment.
In the Near and Middle East, some
countries are untroubled by drug
addiction whereas in others it is a
serious problem. The United Arab
Republic has many hashish smokers
and a far from négligeable number
of opium smokers. Iran faces a
difficult problem with the switch from
opium to heroin following the coura¬
geous decision of the Iranian govern¬
ment in 1955 to outlaw all use, trade
and production of narcotic drugs.
In the Far East and South-East
Asia, there are still a large number
of opium addicts, in the order of
300,000 to 350,000. The Far East,
like the United States, is undoubtedly
a sensitive focal point in the world
of drug abuse. Governments in the
region frankly admit that many rural
communities in Burma, Thailand and
Laos cultivate the opium poppy and
smoke the drug. Singapore has at
least 10,000 opium smokers, and
Malaysia probably more.
The black spot of the region is
Hong Kong which may have as many
as 80,000 to 100,000 heroin addicts.
A government White Paper published
in 1959 calculated at 170 million Hong
Kong dollars the sums squandered
each year on the clandestine drug
market in Hong Kong.
There are also about 3,000 heroin
addicts in Japan. Of mainland China
we can say nothing, since no official
data is available.
If the national and international
regulations governing the legal nar¬
cotics trade were strictly enforced,
drug addicts would have no source
of supply and would rapidly disappear.
As a result of very precise interna¬
tional agreements, trade in all nar
cotic drugs, whether natural or manu¬
factured, has been severely restricted.
The opium poppy is the basis of
opium and its derivatives: morphine
and heroin. International agreements
therefore, as a first step limited the
number of countries authorized to
produce opium. (There are presently
seven Bulgaria, Greece, India, Iran,
Turkey, USSR and Yugoslavia. Gree¬
ce and Iran, however, have stopped
production).
A complex system of controls,
export and import licenses, was orga¬
nized so that, theoretically, not a
single gramme of opium could escape
control and be diverted from the
authorized trade channels through
which the legitimate needs of medi¬
cine, science and industry are suppli¬
ed. Unfortunately, despite all these
efforts, reality is still rather far from
theory.
Authorized production is diverted
to illegal use, either by producers who
fail to declare the totality of their
crop to the official monopoly, or by

TRADE
ROUTES
OF ILLICIT
DRUGS
Tentacular "trade routes" of the
world's illicit drug traffic criss¬
cross this map prepared by Inter¬
pol in 1967. It shows the areas of
production and drug extraction,
from opium to morphine and from
cannabis crops to marijuana, and
the routes and means of transport.
From the plantations where the
opium poppy is grown illicitly and
from the High Plateaux of the Andes
where the leaves of the coca bush
are harvested, as well as from the
fields where cannabis is grown in
Africa and the Middle East, the raw
materials of narcotic drugs flow-
to ports for illicit export. Traffickers
try to use every trick in the trade
to move their drugs across frontiers.
Vast and complex organizations,
comprising their own pernicious
army of chemists, smugglers, ban¬
kers, wholesalers and retailers spread
a formidable network across the
world. Interpol has set up its
own formidable network to coun¬
teract these clandestine activities.

farmers who plant a larger surface
than that authorized. Anyone familiar
with rationing during the Second
World War can easily imagine this
situation. Moreover, there are vast
areas in the world which have vir¬
tually no government control and
where poppies are grown illegally on
a large scale.
To sum up the opium situation, we
find a sort of crescent-shaped "fis¬
sure" from the Near East to South-
East Asia where opium is produced
illegally. To put it in figures, we
quote an estimate found in a recent
report of the Central Permanent
Opium Committee: 1,200 tons of
opium are apparently produced ille¬
gally in the world while legal pro¬
duction amounts to about 800 tons,
to supply legally recognized needs.
This figure of 1,200 tons was recently
confirmed.
International trade routes in opium
and its derivatives (morphine and
heroin) start from this vast region.
Some reach the United States via
the Mediterranean and Europe; others,
via South-East Asia and Singapore,
reach Hong Kong, Japan and occasion¬
ally the West Coast of the United
States and Canada. There are of
course subsidiary regional zones, but
it would take too long here to list
the various routes.
As for cannabis, it is impossible to
make an accurate estimate of its ille¬
gal production because it can grow
wild just about anywhere, so long as
the climate is at all suitable. Its
traffic is also international in scale.
The situation is a little clearer as
regards cocaine, although it is no less
alarming: most of the cocaine traffic
originates in South America and par¬
ticularly in Bolivia and Peru.
To give a better idea of the
complexity of these problems, it
should be stressed that the illegal
smuggling of narcotics, considered
from a purely national point of view,
is in no way related to drug addiction.
Perhaps the best example is that of
France where the number of heroin
addicts is négligeable but where
important quantities of morphine and
heroin are seized regularly (186 kilos
in 1967) which indicates the existence
of processing laboratories in that
country.
From the criminologist's point of
view, drug smuggling is a special
offence, with a pattern all of its own.
Unlike most criminal offences, there
are, strictly speaking, no victims; no
one complains to the police of injury
or damages; no one reports that he
has obtained a certain quantity of
drugs or how he did so; in this type

of violation of the law, the addict is
the accomplice of the smuggler and
the peddlar.
Nor do cases of drug trafficking
offer much scope for the "scientific"
police investigation. There are few
clues to be gathered at the scene
of the crime; no possibility of techni¬
cal analysis or observation; few fin¬
gerprints which could lead to the
identification of the culprit.
Another peculiarity of the drug traf¬
fic is that, it is often in the hands of
old offenders who are well acquainted
with the dark and slippery ways of
the underworld. It is not usually a
game for novices. The U.S. Commis¬
sioner of Narcotic Drugs reported a
few years ago that 63 per cent of
those arrested for narcotic offences
in the U.S.A. had previous criminal
records.
Traffic in drugs, hence, is the per¬
fect type of organized crime. It is
clearly impossible for the same per¬
son to harvest a kilo of opium in his
own fields in India or Burma, to turn
it into 100 grammes of morphine and
then into 100 grammes of heroin, and
after that cross to the United States,
Canada or Hong Kong to sell it.
On the contrary, the illicit drug
traffic is a "big business" operation,
whose instigators first have to invest
large sums in the purchase of drugs.
They also must hire specialists or at
least persons capable of processing
the raw material through several
stages. They have to set up a
transport system, often stretching
over thousands of miles. Finally,
they have to penetrate and become
known in the closed circles of the
narcotics racket in order to sell their
products.
In the illegal drug trade, there are
the producers of raw material, the
processors or manufacturers, the
wholesalers, semi-wholesalers, retail¬
ers, bankers and carriers.
Good products have their brand
names; blocks of morphine labelled
"999" are famous; so are the little
bags of cannabis marked "The keys
of Paradise". It is not unusual to
see packets marked "Genuine quality
product; beware of imitations".
Drug smugglers are wily and daring.
They use every trick to move their
merchandise. Heroin has been dis¬
covered in the walls of refrigerators
(Hong Kong), in oscilloscopes (USA);
bales of goatskins stuffed with mor¬
phine have been found in Marseilles.
A few months ago, near Geneva, a
Turkish truck loaded with water me¬
lons was stopped; hidden in specially
prepared compartments the police

UNDERWORLD OF NARCOTICS (Continued)
102 countries in the Interpol network
found 500 kilogrammes of morphine.
In South-East ' Asia small tourist
planes sometimes put down on impro¬
vised landing fields and load opium
which is then parachuted over the
sea. Protected by plastic bags, the
opium is towed underwater and
smuggled into port.
To cross the U.S. frontiers, drug
smugglers recruit "carriers" who, in
the guise of simple tourists, carry
rigged suitcases from one address to
another. Spurred by periodic arrests
and failures, the drug traffickers are
constantly trying to evade the police
and in this incessant battle of wits,
it is obviously the trafficker who
nearly always has the initiative; it is
he who makes the first move.
The world-wide traffic in narcotics
obviously is not an operation master¬
minded by a single gang. But the
activities of small groups of smugglers
together forge a chain that encircles
the world. All these gangs have
their "territories", their contacts with
other gangs, sometimes their mono¬
polies and often their rivalries.
By and large the fight against the
illicit traffic in narcotics is an extre¬
mely difficult one for the police.
Following up the intricate threads of
its clandestine operations involves
long and patient investigation. First
a few suspects have to be singled
out and shadowed continuously for
long periods. Scraps of information
picked up have to be pieced together
like the parts of a jigsaw puzzle until
a coherent pattern is revealed. For
days and nights on end investigators

must watch without being seen, sha¬
dow their quarry without arousing sus¬
picion. And even modern aids such
as cameras with telephoto lenses
cannot solve all their problems.
If it is to be effective, police action
has to be co-ordinated and centraliz¬
ed on a national scale. For many
years the United Nations and the
International Criminal Police Organi¬
zation (Interpol) have urged that
in each country the repression of the
illicit drug traffic should be entrusted
to special investigators with authority
over large areas, and that their action
should be co-ordinated through a
central office.
Co-ordination of police action inter¬
nationally is another indispensable
factor and it was precisely to accom¬
plish this that Interpol was created.
Interpol is not an autonomous
police force which sends out its
detectives all over the world to inves¬
tigate crime and arrest criminals. It
is an organization with international
headquarters in France at St-Cloud,
on the outskirts of Paris, and its job
is to maintain mutual collaboration
between the world's police forces in
the struggle against crime. One need
hardly add that one of its responsi¬
bilities is to co-ordinate the fight
against drug smuggling.
The need-for international action
had first to be recognized by the
police in the various countries, and
they had to realize that their respon¬
sibility did not stop at their own
frontiers. Then machinery for this
co-operation was needed and, as a
priority, the creation in each country
of a special international police liaison
service which would also serve as a
base, for dealing with international
problems.
Today, 102 countries each have this
special police service known as the
"National Central Office-Interpol,"
through which information is exchang¬
ed and arrangements for co-operation
channelled.
The General Secretariat of Inter¬
pol was created as the co-ordinating
body for the centres and as a records
and information centre for police
affairs.
Through the vast network formed
by the National Central Offices and
the Interpol Secretariat there is
now daily co-operation in tracking
down criminals on the run, identifying
suspects, exchanging data, handling
requests for investigations of every
kind everything in fact, which can
help an investigation to succeed
through international action.
To make such contacts easier,
Interpol has set up its own radio
network in which 40 countries now par¬
ticipate. Last year the network trans¬
mitted 120,000 messages, many hun-

The new Unesco Statement on Race and Racial
Prejudice, published below, is a document of
paramount importance in our world today, faced
with the challenge of peaceful relations between men
of different races. It is painfully clear to anyone
who follows current events that prejudice and
discrimination rooted in differences of race have
led to many acts of violence and constitute a serious
menace to the future peace of the world. The
"Unesco Courier" sincerely hopes that this Unesco
Statement will be carefully read and studied in
every part of the world and that it may serve
as a guide and inspiration for individuals and
governments alike.
STATEMENT ON RACE
AND RACIAL PREJUDICE
30
"All men are born free and equal both in dignity
and in rights". This universally proclaimed demo¬
cratic principle stands in jeopardy wherever political,
economic, social and cultural inequalities affect human
group relations. A particularly striking obstacle to the
recognition of equal dignity for all is racism. Racism
continues to haunt the world. As a major social pheno¬
menon it requires the attention of all students of the scien¬
ces of man.
Racism stultifies the development of those who suffer
from it, perverts those who apply it, divides nations
within themselves, aggravates international conflict
and threatens world peace.
The conference of experts meeting in Paris in Sep¬
tember 1967, agreed that racist doctrines lack any
scientific basis whatsoever. It reaffirmed the pro¬
positions adopted by the international meeting held in
Moscow in 1964 which was called to re-examine the bio¬
logical aspects of the statements on race and racial
differences issued in 1950 and 1951. In particular, it
draws attention to the following points:
All men living today belong to the same species and
descend from the same stock.
The division of the human species into "races" is partly
conventional and partly arbitrary and does not imply any
hierarchy whatsoever. Many anthropologists stress the
importance of human variation, but believe that "racial"
divisions have limited scientific interest and may even
carry the risk of inviting abusive generalization.
M Current biological knowledge does not permit us to
impute cultural achievements to differences in genetic
potential. Differences in the achievements of different
peoples should be attributed solely to their cultural
history. The peoples of the world today appear to
possess equal biological potentialities for attaining any
level of civilization.
Racism grossly falsifies the knowledge of human biology.
The human problems arising from so-called "race"
relations are social in origin rather than biological.
A basic problem is racism, namely, anti-social beliefs
and acts which are based on the fallacy that discriminatory
inter-group relations are justifiable on biological grounds.
Groups commonly evaluate their characteristics in
comparison with others. Racism falsely claims that
there is a scientific basis for arranging groups
hierarchically in terms of psychological and cultural cha¬
racteristics that are immutable and innate. In this way
it seeks to make existing differences appear inviolable as
a means of permanently maintaining current relations bet¬
ween groups.
Faced with the exposure of the falsity of its biolo¬
gical doctrines, racism finds ever new stratagems
for justifying the inequality of groups. It points to
the fact that groups do not intermarry, a fact which follows,
in part, from the divisions created by racism. It uses this
fact to argue the thesis that this absence of intermarriage
derives from differences of a biological order. Whenever
it fails in its attempts to prove that the source of group
differences lies in the biological field, it falls back upon
justifications in terms of divine purpose, cultural differences,
disparity of educational standards or some other doctrine
which would serve to mask its continued racist beliefs.
Thus, many of the problems which racism presents in the
world today do not arise merely from its open manifesta¬
tions, but from the activities of those who discriminate on
racial grounds but are unwilling to acknowledge it.
Racism has historical roots. It has not been a
universal phenomenon. Many contemporary socie-
ties and cultures show little trace of it. It was not
evident for long periods in world history. Many forms of ra¬
cism have arisen out of the conditions of conquest, out of the

justification of Negro slavery and its aftermath of racial
inequality in the West, and out of the colonial relationship.
Among other examples is that of anti-semitism, which has
played a particular rôle in history, with Jews being the
chosen scapegoat to take the blame for problems and
crises met by many societies.
The major techniques for coping with racism involve
changing those social situations which give rise to
prejudice, preventing the prejudiced from acting in
accordance with their beliefs, and combating the false
beliefs themselves.
M The anti-colonial revolution of the Twentieth century
has opened up new possibilities for eliminating the
scourge of racism. In some formerly dependent
countries, people formerly classified as inferior have for the
first time obtained full political rights. Moreover, the
participation of formerly dependent nations in international
organizations in terms of equality has done much to under¬
mine racism.
There are, however, some instances in certain
societies in which groups, victims of racialistic
practices, have themselves applied doctrines with
racist implications in their struggle for freedom. Such an
attitude is a secondary phenomenon, a reaction stemming
from men's search for an identity which prior racist theory
and racialistic practices denied them. None the less, the
new forms of racist ideology, resulting from this prior
exploitation, have no justification in biology. They are a
product of a political struggle and have no scientific
foundation.
In order to undermine racism it is not sufficient
that biologists should expose its fallacies. It is
also necessary that psychologists and sociologists
should demonstrate its causes. The social structure is
always an important factor. However, within the same
social structure, there may be great individual variation in
racialistic behaviour, associated with the personality of the
individuals and their personal circumstances.
The committee of experts agreed on the following
conclusions about the social causes of race
prejudice:
Social and economic causes of racial prejudice are
particularly observed in settler societies wherein are
found conditions of great disparity of power and property,
in certain urban areas where there have emerged
ghettoes in which individuals are deprived of equal
access to employment, housing, political participation,
education, and the administration of justice, and in many
societies where social and economic tasks which are
deemed to be contrary to the ethics or beneath the dignity
of its members are assigned to a group of different
origins who are derided, blamed and punished for taking
on these tasks.
Individuals with certain personality troubles may be
particularly inclined to adopt and manifest racial preju¬
dices. Small groups, associations, and social move¬
ments of a certain kind sometimes preserve and transmit
racial prejudices. The foundations of the prejudices
lie, however, in the economic and social system of a
society.
Racism tends to be cumulative. Discrimination deprives
a group of equal treatment and presents that group as
a problem. The group then tends to be blamed for its
own condition, leading to further elaboration of racist
theory.
It is recognized that the basically important changes
in the social structure that may lead to the elimin¬
ation of racial prejudice may require decisions of a
political nature. It is also recognized, however, that
certain agencies of enlightenment, such as education and
other means of social and economic advancement, mass
media, and law can be immediately and effectively mobilized
for the elimination of racial prejudice.
The school and other instruments for social and
¿| economic progress can be one of the most effective
agents for the achievement of broadened under-
standing and the fulfilment of the potentialities of man.
They can equally much be used for the perpetuation of
discrimination and inequality. It is therefore essential that
the resources for education and for social and economic
action of all nations be employed in two ways.
The schools should ensure that their curricula contain
scientific understandings about race and human unity,
and that invidious distinctions about peoples are not
made in texts and classrooms.
Because the skills to be gained in formal and vocational
education become increasingly important with the pro¬
cesses of technological development, the resources of
the schools and other resources should be fully available
to all parts of the population with neither restriction nor
discrimination.
Furthermore, in cases where, for historical reasons,
certain groups have a lower average education and
economic standing, it is the responsibility of the society
to take corrective measures. These measures should
ensure, so far as possible, that the limitations of poor
environments are not passed on to the children.
In view of the importance of teachers in any educational
programme, special attention should be given to their
training. Teachers should be made conscious of the degree
to which they reflect the prejudices which may be current
in their society. They should be encouraged to avoid
these prejudices.
Governmental units and other organizations con-
cerned should give special attention to improving
the housing situations and work opportunities avail-
able to victims of racism. This will not only counteract
the effects of racism, but in itself can be a positive way
of modifying racist attitudes and behaviour.
The media of mass communication are increasingly
[|f important in promoting knowledge and understand-
ing, but their exact potentiality is not fully known.
Continuing research into the social utilization of the media
is needed in order to assess their influence in relation to
formation of attitudes and behavioural patterns in the field
of race prejudice and race discrimination. Because the
mass media reach vast numbers of people at different
educational and social levels their rôle in encouraging or 01
combating race prejudice can be crucial. Those who work **
in these media should maintain a positive approach to the
promotion of understanding between groups and popula-

tions. Representation of peoples in stereotypes and hold¬
ing them up to ridicule should be avoided. Attachment to
news reports of racial designations which are not germane
to the accounts should also be avoided.
Law is among the most important means of ensuring
equality between individuals and one of the most
effective means of fighting racism.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 10 Decem¬
ber 1948 and the related international agreements and
conventions which have taken effect subsequently can con¬
tribute effectively, on both the national and international
level, to the fight against any injustice of racist origin.
National legislation is a means of effectively outlawing
racist propaganda and acts based upon racial discrimina¬
tion. Moreover, the policy expressed in such legislation
must bind not only the courts and judges charged with its
enforcement, but also all agencies of government of what¬
ever level or whatever character.
It is not claimed that legislation can immediately eliminate
prejudice. Nevertheless, by being a means of protecting
the victims of acts based upon prejudice, and by setting
a moral example backed by the dignity of the courts, it can,
in the long run, even change attitudes.
Ethnic groups which represent the object of some
form of discrimination are sometimes accepted and
tolerated by dominating groups at the cost of their
having to abandon completely their cultural identity. It
should be stressed that the effort of these ethnic groups
to preserve their cultural values should be encouraged.
They will thus be better able to contribute to the enrich¬
ment of the total culture of humanity.
Racial prejudice and discrimination in the world
today arise from historical and social phenomena
and falsely claim the sanction of science. It is,
therefore, the responsibility of all biological and social
scientists, philosophers, and others working in related disci¬
plines, to ensure that the results of their research are not
misused by those who wish to propagate racial prejudice
and encourage discrimination.
This statement was prepared by a committee of experts on
race and racial prejudice which met at Unesco House, Paris,
from 18 to 26 September 1967. The following experts took part
in the committee's work:
Professor MUDDATH1R ABDEL RAHIM (University of Khar¬
toum, Sudan); Professor GEORGES BALANDIER (University of
Paris, France); Professor CELIO DE OLIVEIRA BORJA (Univer¬

dreds of them concerning traffic in
narcotics.
In its role as world headquarters
against international crime, the Inter¬
pol Secretariat not only keeps re¬
cords of all traffickers and of all per¬
sons implicated in any way with the
drug traffic; it also circulates their des¬
criptions and gathers information on
gangs and their smuggling techniques.
One day for example, a man inform¬
ed the Belgian police that he had
been approached to drive his car with
a quantity of drugs from Istanbul
(Turkey) to Western Europe. He was
asked to maintain contact with the
smugglers.
The Turkish police were alerted and
took steps to keep in touch with the
driver and to catch the smugglers
red-handed. The gang, however, was
wary and revealed their plan of ope¬
ration to the "carrier" only in snippets:
a hiding place had been arranged in
the petrol tank of his car. The mor¬
phine was to be driven to Marseilles
and delivered in exchange for half a
Turkish pound note, the other half of
which he would be given just before
leaving Istanbul. On his return trip he
was to travel via Switzerland and
pick up a lead of contraband watches.
On the day he was due to leave,
the Turkish police searched his car
and discovered nearly 40 kilos of mor¬
phine. Most of the gang were iden¬
tified and arrested: information sent to
the French police enabled them to
identify the person who was to receive
the drug in Marseilles.
Sometimes operations of this type
are more complex and delicate. In
such cases, a detective from Hong
Kong, for instance, might be sent to
Bangkok to give the authorities there
details of a case which began in Hong
Kong, but which also had ramifications
in Thailand.
The world still has hundreds of
thousands of drug addicts, but there
would be many many more if pre¬
ventive and repressive measures had
not been adopted and applied on a
world scale. Great progress has been
made in international police co-opera¬
tion since the groundwork was laid
during the period between the two
World Wars.
Yet no one could deny that flaws
still exist in the present system for
stamping out the illicit traffic in drugs.
Not all countries attach the same
importance to the problem, and over
large areas official controls are either
non-existent or inadequate, which
makes things much easier for the
smugglers.
Frontier control is especially diffi¬
cult, in one area because of the topo¬
graphy of the country, in another be¬
cause control services are swamped
by the volume of travellers crossing
the border. The extraordinary ease
with which people travel nowadays
makes it difficult for the police to cap¬
ture all the smugglers and criminals
who slip unseen among them.
Fresh problems have been created
by the new synthetic drugs, LSD
among them.
The police have a difficult job ahead
of them. And they will not succeed
in it unless at the same time the fun¬
damental economic, social and edu¬
cational problems are solved in cer¬
tain parts of the world. Arresting a
drug smuggler is fine. But a drug
smuggler without a job because he
has no merchandise or no customers
would certainly be far betterl

is underwater acoustic research off La
Jolla, California, but its cable hoist system
capable of handling a 30,000 pound pay-
load will later be' used In the operation
of several océanographie research vehicles
including a remote controlled sea floor
tractor and a two-man deep submersible.
Radio-clubs
in Cameroon and Togo
A United Nations Development-Unesco
audio visual specialist from Haiti has
helped to organize 120 educational radio
listening groups throughout Cameroon, and
has trained personnel to direct them. In
Togo, radio clubs grew from 475 to 746
during the second half of 1967, under
a programme introduced by a Unesco edu¬
cational broadcasting specialist from India.
Airport for
prehistoric city
Mohenjo-Daro in Pakistan, the largest
planned city of the prehistoric world, has
recently acquired its own airport. The
greatest of the ancient Indus cities to sur¬
vive, Mohenjo-Daro is 300 miles from
Karachi across the Sind desert. Excavation
of the 4,000-year-old city from the sand
which had covered it began in the 1920s,
but until recently few. people other than
archaeologists have been able to see the
results.
Afro-Asian books in English
Two monthly checklists of English-lan¬
guage books published in Asia and Africa
are now available for the use of libraries,
scholars and research institutes. . Sub¬
scriptions may be obtained from K.K. Roy
(Private) Ltd., P.O. Box 10210, Calcutta 19,

Bringing science
to Papuan schools
A joint Unesco-Unicef project is to help
promote general science teaching in the
Territory of Papua and New Guinea, at
present administered by Australia under a
U.N. agreement. Unicef will supply labora¬
tory and science equipment and other
forms of aid, totalling $275,000 during the
next three years; Australia will contribute
$825,000; and Unesco will advise on science
teaching and programme development.
Technical advice and guidance will also
be given by the Unesco Regional Centre
of Science and Technology for South-East
Asia, in Bangkok.
U.K. library honours
Gutenberg anniversary
Rare printed books and manuscripts of
the 15th century are on display in the
John Rylands Library, Manchester (U.K.),
to mark the fifth centenary of the death
of Johann Gutenberg, Europe's inventor of
printing from movable type. The collection
includes a 36-line Bible printed in Bam¬
berg before 1460, of which only 11 copies
are believed to exist, and a Psalter of 1457,
the first book to use more than one printed
colour and to carry a colphone with the
printer's name, and place and date of
publication.
New names among top
translating countries
The U.S.S.R. remains top of the list of
translating countries with 3,968 titles,
according to the latest (19th) edition of
Unesco's "Index Translationum," (1) which
lists 39,367 translations published in
70 countries during 1966. The U.S.S.R. is
now followed by Yugoslavia (3,452), which
lay eighth in 1964, and whose production
has more than doubled since then to
bring it ahead of Germany (3,095). Another
noteworthy advance is that of Spain (2,429),
now in fourth place ahead of the U.S.A.
(2,069). Lenin remains the most trans¬
lated author (201) followed by Georges
Simenon (137) and Tolstoy (122). During
1966 there were 197 translations of the
Bible.

Letters to the Editor
U.S.S.R. TODAY
Sir,
34
In your Interesting number, "U.S.S.R.
Today" (Nov. 1967), we see progress
in many fields, particularly for young
people in all levels of education. We
see the youth of the country at work
and play. All this makes us want to
go there and see for ourselves.
Nevertheless, two things puzzle us:
Is there no poverty? There was
nothing to suggest it in your illus¬
trations. And yet there is poverty in
France, In the U.S.A., in fact every¬
where. Has the Soviet Union managed
to vanquish this evil?
Why does a happy country, blessed
with natural resources, whose people
have made tremendous progress lock
itself within its own frontiers?

HOW A NATION
'KEEPS ITS COOL'
Sir,
I wish to express my appreciation
for your issue devoted to the two
Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana, and their related modern
art forms (Dec. 1967).
The various competently written
articles by well-known authorities not
only introduce Indian tradition to out¬
siders, but give the Indians them¬
selves a capsule refresher course in
their past and present achievements.
A significant fact to be noted is the
continuity of Indian tradition and
culture.
The handsomely got up issue is
indeed very opportune at a time when
so much editorial space Is being
given both in India and elsewhere
to the near-chaos that prevails on
the political and economic fronts in
the country today. One gets a clear
picture of the characteristic ability of
the nation "to keep its cool" even
in troubled times, deriving its vital
force from an ancient faith that is
never out of fashion.

SLAVERY STILL EXISTS
Sir,
Thank you for the remarkable num¬
ber on Human Rights (Jan. 1968).
Article 4 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights states: "No one
shall be held in slavery or servi¬
tude..." Yet slavery is still found in
some parts of the world. A docu¬
mentary film, "Slaves Still Exist,"
drew attention to this tragic problem
in 1966. Even so, people and govern¬
ments, can never be reminded too
often that one of man's inalienable
rights is still being flagrantly and
persistently violated.

AUSTRALIA'S FOLK LORE
Sir,
I should here like to make a plea
for the conservation of what we choose
to think of as our Folk Lore. Essen¬
tially this may be regarded as the
more human and personal aspects of
our country's history. Yet far too
often the great drama of important
events is chronicled with little thought
given to the secondary effects brought
about by such happenings.
Too little has been done, here in
Australia, to correlate and preserve
these adjuncts to the "purer" form of
history as we learnt it from school
textbooks. The importance of Folk
Lore is too often overlooked by the
academic historian; or omitted be¬
cause, in being passed down, stories
become so distorted as to sound
ludicrous. The greatest problem lies
in seeking out these stories. As yet
another generation passes, so too
does the bulk of the remaining
legends unless a zealous effort is
made now to save them.
As an historian, this worries me.
Our National Archives is ill-equipped
to act the role of guardian of Austra¬
lia's Folk Lore. From what I have
been able to observe, other nations
are placed similarly. Novelists here
seem presently to be doing more to
document this form of history than
are government departments upon
whose shoulders much of the respon¬
sibility should lie.

NOISE ADDICTS
Sir,
Your issue on Noise Pollution (July
1967) shows how much needs to be
done to overcome this problem.
One point you should have made
is that people in cities seem to be
addicted to noise. In their homes
transistor radios blare away all day
long, making conversation difficult if
not impossible. These "noiseboxes"
are often left switched on even when
housewives are out shopping.
What is the real reason that impels
people to carry transistor radios
around with them so as to have noise
within reach at all times? Isn't it
because they dread the solitude of
their own company when all is quiet.

WORLD SURVEY
OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
Sir,
Two colleagues and I are collecting
material with a view to an eventual
publication of studies relating to Chil¬
dren's Literature. It is our hope that
sufficient material of an international
nature exists to justify inclusion as a
major emphasis of the projected book.
We are primarily concerned with
topical authoritative critical opinion of
literature of children or bibliogra¬
phies, etc. stemming from: Major
ethnic groupings (Asia, Europe, etc.);
National bodies of literature (Persian,
Chinese, etc.); Countries achieving
full entity (the so-called "emerging
countries", e.g.: Nigeria, Kenya, etc.).
Though the book will be primarily
designed for the needs of teachers
we anticipate it could have a wider
appeal, hence items need not have
a pedagogical emphasis.

TREASURES OF PARIS IN PERIL
Sir.
Paris had the good fortune to
escape damage during the Second
World War. The heart of the city
between the Marais and the Louvre
boasts many architectural treasures.
This area may be mutilated if a
proposed urban development plan is
approved by the Paris Municipal
Council in June. To prevent it being
ravaged, I believe the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" should devote an article to the
splendid buildings in the Halles and
Saint-Merri districts. Your magazine
with its international readership would
be a major asset for the defence of
an historically important section of
Paris.

INDIA'S ENGINEERING
GRADUATES
Sir,
The article, "Only the Educated are
Free" by Louis François (Jan. 1968)
nicely outlines the importance and
problems of education vis-à-vis Uni¬
versal Human Rights, and contains
good statistical Information.
May I point out, however, that as
far as my information goes, Indian
universities and institutions of higher
education last year turned out 13,000
graduates in engineering and not 5,000
as stated in the article.

INTERPOL
AND
THE ILLICIT
DRUG TRAFFIC
Although drug addiction has been a problem that has
long preoccupied public authorities, an important change
in drug habits has marked the industrial countries in
recent years. The sedatives, tranquillizers and stimulants
now being mass produced by the pharmaceutical industry
have attracted an increasing number of persons
especially among young people seeking a "cosmic
upheaval". Unlike opium, hashish and cocaine, these new
products have not come under international control,
although in all countries laws forbid their sale except
by medical prescription. A vast illicit market in these
drugs has developed, supplied by petty traffickers. The
man seen here is being questioned by the police after a
hoard of barbiturates and amphetamines was found in
his car. (See article in this issue by Jean Nepote, Secre¬
tary-General of INTERPOL.)
