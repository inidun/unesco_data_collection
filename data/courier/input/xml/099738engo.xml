1988, watercolour and
Indian ink
(35 x 54 cm)
by Masako
This watercolour by Masako, a
Japanese artist who has lived in
France for more than twenty
years, seeks to express the eter¬
nal renewal of life, symbolized by
an interplay of waves, reflections
and flowing calligraphic motifs.
Painted on a printed page, it com¬
bines the rigour and delicacy of
Japanese draughtsmanship with
bright, impressionist colours.

We live in a complex, contradictory, chaotic world in which landmarks and
systems that worked in the past are breaking down, unpredictable factors
are increasingly at work, and the forces of regression and the forces of
progress sometimes mingle confusingly. In such a world it is normal that
people should lose their bearings and feel afraid.
But surely pessimism is no more justified than optimism. We must make
our choice. To profess an informed optimism is to decide that the worst is
not bound to happen, that worthwhile things can still be done, and that
freedom should be used to do all we can to make sure that good prevails.
Choosing to hope and act implies a certain way of interpreting what is
happening in the world, of clearsightedly promoting the possibilities of
change, of reacting positively to alarm signals and regarding them not as
reasons for despair but as opportunities to break new ground and turn fail¬
ures into success.
To take one example, what assessment should we make of the mass of
data that has accumulated about development, one of the thorny problems
that have dominated the second half of this century?
The tragic rise of unemployment, exclusion, poverty and violence has
occurred, paradoxically enough, in a world that continues to grow wealthier
all the time, in the South as elsewhere. In dozens of developing countries,
hundreds of millions of people are living longer and more comfortably, are
studying longer and producing more sophisticated goods. Some eastern Asian
countries are even becoming the direct competitors of the industrial North.
These two trends are two sides of the same coin. Both are a part of the
same modernizing process. The alarming thing is that they are both hap¬
pening simultaneously. What is becoming intolerable is the widening gap
between the haves and the have-nots, between those who are involved in
modernization and those who are excluded from it (both internationally and
within each society). The kind of development that generates inequality
as well as growth is now under fire.
This counter-attack has been launched everywhere at the same time and
in the same terms on the level at which the real problems existthe plan¬
etary level. It is a radical new departure in human history. A gigantic first
step towards change, an irreversible new awareness of the need to
impose human demands for fairness and solidarity onto the blind play of
market forces.
Development must now be conceived in social terms. This is why a World
Summit for Social Development has been convened by the United Nations
and is opening in Copenhagen on 6 March and why a Forum of non-gov¬
ernmental organizations being held simultaneously in the same city will
be attended by hundreds of organizations representing civil society from
almost every country in the world. Unesco has taken an active part in
preparing for the Summit and Forum, and this issue of the Unesco Courier
is intended to give our readers a preview of the debates and introduce them
to some current thinking on development.

SPECIAL FEATURE
AUNG SAN SUU KYI
Winner of the Nobel Peace prize, under
house arrest in Myanmar since 1989
Human rights activist, champion of democracy in her country,
daughter of the Burmese nationalist leader Aung San (assas¬
sinated in 1947), Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house
arrest since 1989. In spite of the victory of her party in the
elections of May 1990 and support from all over the world,
the authorities have so far refused to restore her freedom. She
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. A collection of
her writings, edited by her husband, Michael Aris, has been
published under the title Freedom from Fear by Penguin
Books, Harmondsworth, UK.
Peace as a goal is an ideal which will
not be contested by any government
or nation, not even the most belligerent.
And the close interdependence of the culture
of peace and the culture of development
also finds ready acceptance. But it remains
uncertain how far governments are pre¬
pared to concede that democracy and
human rights are indivisible from the culture
of peace and therefore essential to sustained
development. There is ample evidence that
culture and development can actually be
made to serve as pretexts for resisting calls
for democracy and human rights. It is
widely known that some governments argue
that democracy is a Western concept alien to
indigenous values; it has also been asserted
that economic development often conflicts
with political (i.e. democratic) rights and
that the latter should necessarily give way to
the former. In the light of such arguments
culture and development need to be care¬
fully examined and defined so that they
may not be used, or rather misused, to block
the aspirations of peoples for democratic
institutions and human rights.
'Development means more than
economic growth'
The unsatisfactory record of development
in many parts of the world and the ensuing
need for a definition of development which
means more than mere economic growth
became a matter of vital concern to econ¬
omists and international agencies more
than a decade ago1. In A New Concept of
Development, published in 1983, the
French economist François Perroux stated,
"Development has not taken place: it rep¬
resents a dramatic growth of awareness, a
promise, a matter of survival indeed. Intel¬
lectually, however, it is still only dimly
perceived"2. Later in the same book he
asserted that ". . . personal development,
the freedom of persons fulfilling their
potential in the context of the values to
which they subscribe and which they expe¬
rience in their actions, is one of the main¬
springs of all forms of development"3.
While the concept of human develop¬
ment is beginning to assume a dominant
position in the thinking of international
economists and administrators, the Market
Economy, not merely adorned with capital
letters but seen in an almost mystic haze, is
increasingly regarded by many govern¬
ments as the quick and certain way to

perception of themselves.'
material prosperity. It is assumed that eco¬
nomic measures can resolve all the prob¬
lems facing their countries. Economics has
been described as the "deus ex machina, the
most important key to every lock of every
door to the new Asia we wish to see".
When economics is regarded as "the
most important key to every lock of every
door", it is only natural that the worth of
man should come to be decided largely,
even wholly, by his effectiveness as an eco¬
nomic tool4. This is at variance with the
vision of a world where economic, political
and social institutions work to serve man
instead of the other way round; where cul¬
ture and development coalesce to create
an environment in which human potential
can be realized to the full.
The value systems of those with access
to power and of those far removed from
such access cannot be the same. The view¬
point of the privileged is unlike that of the
underprivileged. In the matter of power
and privilege the difference between the
haves and the have-nots is not merely
quantitative, for it has far-reaching psy¬
chological and ideological implications.
And many "economic" concerns are
seldom just that, since they are tied up
with questions of power and privilege. The
problem of poverty provides an example of
the inadequacy of a purely economic
approach to a human situation. Even those
who take a down-to-earth view of basic
human needs agree that ". . . whatever doc¬
tors, nutritionists and other scientists may
say about the objective conditions of depri¬
vation, how the poor themselves perceive
their deprivation is also relevant"5.
The alleviation of poverty thus entails
setting in motion processes which can
change the perceptions of all those con¬
ti cerned. Here power and privilege come
AUNG SAN SUU KYI
into play: "The poor are powerless and
have no voice. Power is the possibility of
expressing and imposing one's will in a
given social relationship, in the face of any
resistance. The poor are incapable of either
imposing, coercing or, in many cases,
having any influence at all"6.
It is not enough merely to provide the
poor with material assistance. They have to
be sufficiently empowered to change their
perception of themselves as helpless and
ineffectual in an uncaring world.
'Empowerment is central to culture
and development'
The question of empowerment is central to
both culture and development. It decides
who has the means of imposing on a nation
or society their view of what constitutes
culture and development and who deter¬
mines what practical measures can be taken
in the name of culture and development.
The more totalitarian a system the more
power will be concentrated in the hands of
the ruling elite and the more culture and
development will be used to serve narrow
interests. The "national culture" can
become a bizarre graft of carefully selected
historical incidents and distorted social
values intended to justify the policies and
actions of those in power7. At the same
time development is likely to be seen in the
now outmoded sense of economic growth.
Statistics, often unverifiable, are reeled off
to prove the success of official measures.
Many authoritarian governments wish
to appear in the forefront of modern
progress but are reluctant to institute gen¬
uine change. Such governments tend to
claim that they are taking a uniquely
national or indigenous path towards a
political system in keeping with the times.
In the decades immediately after the
Second World War socialism was the pop¬
ular option. But increasingly since the
1980s democracy has gained ground. The
focus on a national or indigenous way to
socialism or democracy has "the effect of
stressing cultural continuity as both
process and goal; this in turn obviates the
necessity of defining either democracy or
socialism in institutionally or procedu¬
rally specific terms; and finally, it elevates
the existing political elite to the indis¬
pensable position of final arbiter and inter
preter of what does or does not contribute
to the preservation of cultural integrity"8.
It is often in the name of cultural
integrity as well as social stability and
national security that democratic reforms
based on human rights are resisted by
authoritarian governments. It is insinu¬
ated that some of the worst ills of Western
society are the result of democracy, which
is seen as the progenitor of unbridled
freedom and selfish individualism. It is
claimed, usually without adequate evi¬
dence, that democratic values and human
rights run counter to the national culture,
and therefore to be beneficial they need
to be modified perhaps to the extent that
they are barely recognizable. The people
are said to be as yet unfit for democracy,
therefore an indefinite length of time has to
pass before democratic reforms can be
instituted.
The first form of attack is often based
on the premise, so universally accepted
that it is seldom challenged or even noticed,
that the United States of America is the
supreme example of democratic culture.
What tends to be overlooked is that
although the U.S.A. is certainly the most
important representative of democratic
culture, it also represents many other cul¬
tures, often intricately enmeshed. Among
these are the "I-want-it-all" consumer cul¬
ture, mega-city culture, superpower cul¬
ture, frontier culture, immigrant culture.
There is also a strong media culture
which constantly exposes the myriad prob¬
lems of American society, from large issues
such as street violence and drug abuse to
the matrimonial difficulties of minor
celebrities. Many of the worst ills of Amer¬
ican society, increasingly to be found in
varying degrees in other developed coun¬
tries, can be traced not to the democratic
legacy but to the demands of modern mate¬
rialism. Gross individualism and cut-throat
morality arise when political and intellec¬
tual freedoms are curbed on the one hand
while on the other fierce economic com¬
petitiveness is encouraged by making mate¬
rial success the measure of prestige and
progress. The result is a society where cul¬
tural and human values are set aside and
money value reigns supreme.

DEMOCRACY, THE COMMON HERITAGE OF HUMANITY
erfully diverse nation as the United States
have been prevented from disintegrating if
it had not been sustained by democratic
institutions guaranteed by a constitution
based on the assumption that man's capacity
for reason and justice makes free govern¬
ment possible and that his capacity for pas¬
sion and injustice makes it necessary?9
Democracy in the plural
It is precisely because of the cultural diver¬
sity of the world that it is necessary for dif¬
ferent nations and peoples to agree on those
basic human values which will act as a uni¬
fying factor. When democracy and human
rights are said to run counter to non-
Western culture, such culture is usually
defined narrowly and presented as mono¬
lithic. In fact the values that democracy and
human rights seek to promote can be found
in many cultures. Human beings the world
over need freedom and security that they
may be able to realize their full potential.
The longing for a form of governance that
provides security without destroying
freedom goes back a long way10.
Support for the desirability of strong
government and dictatorship can also be
found in all cultures, both Eastern and
Western: the desire to dominate and the
tendency to adulate the powerful are also
common human traits arising out of a desire
for security. A nation may choose a system
that leaves the protection of the freedom and
security of the many dependent on the incli¬
nations of the empowered few; or it may
choose institutions and practices that will
sufficiently empower individuals and orga¬
nizations to protect their own freedom and

security. The choice will decide how far a
nation will progress along the road to peace
and human development".
Many of the countries in the Third
World now striving for meaningful devel¬
opment are multiracial societies where
there is one dominant racial group and a
number sometimes a large number of
smaller groups: foreign, religious or ethnic
minorities. As poverty can no longer be
defined satisfactorily in terms of basic eco¬
nomic needs, "minority" can no longer be
defined merely in terms of numbers. For
example, it has been noted in a study of
minorities in Burmese history that "In the
process of nation-building ... the notion of
minority in Burma changed, as one group
defines itself as a nation those outside the
group become minorities"12.
Once again, as in the case of poverty, it
is ultimately a question of empowerment.
The provision of basic material needs is
not sufficient to make minority groups
and indigenous peoples feel they are truly
part of the greater national entity. For that
they have to be confident that they too
have an active role to play in shaping the
destiny of the state that demands their alle¬
giance. Poverty degrades a whole society
and threatens its stability while ethnic con¬
flict and minority discontent are two of
the greatest threats to both internal and
regional peace. And when the dispossessed
"minority" is in fact an overwhelming
majority, as happens in countries where
power is concentrated in the hands of the
few, the threat to peace and stability is ever
present even if unperceived.
As the United Nations Development
Programme's Human Development Report
points out, "National governments must
find new ways of enabling their people to
participate more in government and to
allow them much greater influence on the
decisions that affect their lives. Unless this
is done, and done in time, the irresistible
tide of people's rising aspirations will
inevitably clash with inflexible systems,

leading to anarchy and chaos. A rapid
democratic transition and a strengthening
of the institutions of civil society are the
only appropriate responses"13.
The argument that it took long years
for the first democratic governments to
develop in the West is not a valid excuse for
African and Asian countries to drag their
feet over democratic reform. The history of
the world shows that peoples and soci¬
eties do not have to pass through a fixed
series of stages in the course of develop¬
ment. Moreover, latecomers should be able
to capitalize on the experiences of the pio¬
neers and avoid the mistakes and obstacles
that impeded early progress. The idea of
"making haste slowly" is sometimes used
to give backwardness the appearance of
measured progress. But in a fast devel¬
oping world too much emphasis on
"slowly" can be a recipe for disaster.
There will be as many kinds of democ¬
racies as there are nations which accept it
as a form of government. No single type of
"Western democracy" exists; nor is democ¬
racy limited to a mere handful of forms
such as the American, British, French or
Swiss. Each democratic country will have
its own individual characteristics. With the
spread of democracy to eastern Europe
the variety in the democratic style of gov¬
ernment will increase. Similarly there
cannot be one form of Asian democracy; in
each country the democratic system will
develop a character that accords with its
social, cultural and economic needs. But the
basic requirement of a genuine democracy
is that the people should be sufficiently
empowered to be able to participate sig¬
nificantly in the governance of their
country. The thirty articles of the Uni¬
versal Declaration of Human Rights are
aimed at such empowerment. Without
these rights democratic institutions will
be but empty shells incapable of reflecting
the aspirations of the people and unable to
withstand the encroachment of authori¬
tarianism.
The democratic process provides for
political and social change without vio¬
lence. The democratic tradition of free dis¬
cussion and debate allows for the settle¬
ment of differences without resort to
armed conflict. The culture of democracy
O and human rights promotes diversity and
dynamism without disintegration; it is
indivisible from the culture of develop¬
ment and the culture of peace. It is only by
giving firm support to movements that
seek to empower the people through
democratic means that the United Nations
and its agencies will truly be able to pro¬
mote the culture of peace and the culture of
development.
Let me in conclusion summarize my
argument. The true development of human
beings involves much more than mere eco¬
nomic growth. At its heart there must be a
sense of empowerment and inner fulfill¬
ment. This alone will ensure that human
and cultural values remain paramount in a
world where political leadership is often
synonymous with tyranny and the rule of
a narrow elite. People's participation in
social and political transformation is the
central issue of our time.
This can only be achieved through the
establishment of societies which place
human worth above power, and liberation
above control. In this paradigm, develop¬
ment requires democracy, the genuine
empowerment of the people. When this is
achieved, culture and development will nat¬
urally coalesce to create an environment in
which all are valued, and every kind of
human potential can be realized.
Extracts from an address written by Ms.
Aung San Suu Kyi and delivered at her
request by Ms. Corazón Aquino, former
President of the Philippines, at a meeting
of UNESCO's World Commission on Cul¬
ture and Development held in Manila on
21 November 1994.
'it is precisely because of
the cultural diversity of the
world that it is necessary
for different nations and
peoples to agree on those
basic human values which
will act as a unifying factor.'

it was already written in the Lao Tzu, a Chinese classic,
that "the best of all rulers is but a shadowy presence to
his subjects". The notion that "in a nation the people are
the most important, the state is next and the rulers the
least important" is to be found not in the works of a
modern western political theorist but in that of Mencius.

Dismantling the mechanism
Of eXClllSion by Ignacy Sachs
What can be done to prevent societies from
disintegrating as a result of worsening unemployment
and poverty?
IGNACY SACHS
¡s a French socio-economist who
heads the Research Centre on
Contemporary Brazil at the
School of Advanced Studies in
Social Sciences (EHESS) in
Paris, where he is also in
charge of doctoral studies on
comparative research on
development. His works
published in English include
Development and Planning
(Cambridge University Press,
1987) and Studies in Political
Economy of Development
(Pergamon, 1980).
I In June 1992 the Rio Earth Summit laid
down the founding principle of eco-
development or "sustainable development".
The idea is that any development worth the
name should promote social justice, while res¬
pecting nature and seeking economic efficiency
without the latter two factors' becoming ends in
themselves. The Burkinabé historian Joseph Ki-
Zerbo aptly summed up this approach when
he wrote: "Ecodevelopment? Yes. But only as
long as it is people-centred."1
The Social Summit in Copenhagen also turns
its back on an exaggerated emphasis on eco
nomics, which regards economic growth as the
necessary and sufficient condition of develop¬
ment. Our societies are paying a very high price
for having put economics in the driver's seat
instead of being dependent on a social project
democratically defined. The crisis brought about
by structural unemployment and underem¬
ployment affects the whole world. According to
United Nations estimates, almost one-third of
the workforce is affected.
With very few exceptions, all the models seem
to be running out of steam or even collapsing. The
social cost of restructuring the former communist
societies and economies in eastern Europe on
capitalist lines is very high. It is creating distor¬
tions similar to those observed in the countries of
the South which are engaged in an impossible
endeavour to copy models taken over from the
industrialized nations. Here, the processes of

development, or maldevelopment, are bringing

A 'fair-share' civilization
Contrary to forecasts made by theorists of the
"dual" economy functioning at two or more
speeds forms of social exclusion have emerged
on a massive scale. The modern sector no longer
needs the services of marginalized men and
women. At best it relegates them to the purga¬
tory of the informal economy, which is put for¬
ward as a solution to maldevelopment, of which
it is actually one of the worst symptoms. In the
absence of social protection, productive rela¬
tionships in the informal sector are often
extremely brutal. The survival strategies
deployed by those involved in the informal
economy remain, for the time being, a mere
palliative. They must not be allowed to serve as

a pretext for states to evade their responsibilities
and opt out of the fight against the root causes
of exclusion.
This "dualization" of the economy is also
happening in the industrialized countries, where
the problem of social exclusion has become
front-page news. We are witnessing what might
be termed the creation of a "Third World" on a
global scale. This is where the Copenhagen
Summit comes in. To varying extents and in
different ways, the fight against poverty and
for social integration and the creation of pro¬
ductive jobs concerns most of the member coun¬
tries of the United Nations.
We must rethink our development strate¬
gies and invent new ways of regulating mixed
economies (those in which the public and private
sectors coexist). Development transcends the
material dimensions of human existence but it
cannot disregard them. Even if we view it as
the construction of a civilization based on
human beings, such a civilization cannot flourish
unless resources are fairly shared out.
But resources are increasingly unevenly dis¬
tributed within and between nations. The
growth mechanism functions in and through
inequality. It is very hard to correct this phe¬
nomenon by redistributing a small percentage of
income on the margin. Only the distribution of
income that is part of the production process will
have a decisive impact. Unemployment is not an
inevitable result of the globalization of the
economy. The great majority of countries still
sell the bulk of their products, especially services,
on their domestic market. The growth of the
latter will continue to play an essential role in
development. This is particularly true of big
countries and those in which a significant part of

market economy because of its extremely low
purchasing power.
How can hundreds of millions of marginal¬
ized or semi-marginalized people be made more
productive? By identifying opportunities for
employment and self-employment which are
still under-used. These opportunities are bound
up with better management of the resources of
our planet and with the production of services.
This means making a detailed assessment of all
the latent potential for employment, analysing
obstacles, and proposing public policies that
are capable of changing the existing state of
affairs.
The situation is less desperate than it seems.
I believe that the barriers are essentially political
and therefore capable of solution if a broad con¬
sensus of public opinion can be reached on the
measures to be taken. The situation will have to
be examined country by country. But I would
suggest that there are four priority fronts.

rour front-line targets
In rural areas we must introduce forms of
modernization which improve the condition of
small farmers without causing a massive reduc¬
tion in their numbers and which simultaneously
create large numbers of rural jobs in the non-
agricultural sector. We must avoid the dispro¬
portionate growth of cities through the influx of
refugees from the countryside and, wherever
possible, halt rampant and excessive urban
growth of the kind experienced in Latin America
and elsewhere. Because they reproduced, in the
name of an ill-conceived modernity, a model
of agriculture requiring little manpower, many
Latin American countries now find themselves
with tens of millions of city-dwellers living in
precarious conditions. These countries have
been unable to reconcile the enormous reserve
of agricultural land at their disposal with the
abundant supply of labour.
Two new factors have changed the nature of
the problem of the rural economy. First, envi¬
ronmental awareness: we must learn more about
biodiversity and the knowledge acquired in this
sphere by different cultures not in order to
revert to ancestral practices but so as to find
better forms of environment-friendly exploita¬
tion of the agricultural and forest biomass. In
theory, progress in biotechnologies brings highly
productive processes (genetic selection, in vitro
reproduction, direct nitrogen fixation, new
methods of fish farming) within the reach of
small farmers. The range of energy-bearing and
industrial products derived from biomass should
be greatly extended as a result.
Secondly, a decentralized form of industri¬
alization is taking shape. Small towns and vil¬
lages will become the setting for units that

process biomass and produce goods and ser¬
vices for local use and perhaps even for external
markets. A growing number of industries are
already evolving from mass production towards
flexible specialization.
The redeployment of activities in rural areas
is also of direct interest to certain industrial¬
ized countries which are obliged to reduce the
land area given over to food crops because of
surplus production. These countries may well
become rural deserts dotted with urban archi¬
pelagos unless they find new productive activ¬
ities for the countryside.
However, the countryside and small towns
cannot be fully developed without the imple¬
mentation of public policies to provide access to
the land for small farmers, to make informa¬
tion available about loans and market outlets, to
define and protect outlets for rural industries.
Furthermore, agricultural research should not be
left to a handful of multinational companies
which today enjoy a near-monopoly in the field
of genetics.
In the countries of the South, the enor¬
mous current wastage of energy and other natural
resources must be reduced. An enormous amount
needs to be done here in such fields as recycling
waste, re-using materials, finding uses for by-

products that are now neglected, and conserving
energy and water. Above all, capital savings must
be made through better maintenance of infra¬
structures, equipment and buildings.
These activities demand a great deal of man¬
power but they are at least partly self-financing
through the savings they make in the use of
resources, and they are also relatively simple to
organize. The greatest need is for financing sys¬
tems, and these could be established by the
public banks. But nothing much is happening
here, even though we know that the fight against
waste is one of the key elements in ecodevelop-
ment strategies.
There is no point in expecting any signif¬
icant increase in jobs in industry. In countries
which are already industrialized, the number
of jobs in industry will continue to decline. Is it
possible, however, to increase jobs in the services
sector, especially in the social services? If there
is one area in which large numbers of people can
quickly make a specific contribution, this is it
in education, health care and caring for people
of all ages, from young children to the elderly.
Substantial unsatisfied demand exists in the
richest countries, but it cannot be met in com¬
mercial terms. We must therefore seek new

forms of partnership between users, citizens'
associations, the state and the market in order to
reduce the need for public funding. The social
economy co-operatives, mutual-aid institu¬
tions, clubs and associations, community-based
business ventures, non-profit-making private
enterprise has a promising future. But at pre¬
sent it is relegated to the sidelines.
As for the countries of the South, instead
of waiting to become rich before acquiring effi¬
cient social services, they should on the contrary
bank on the fact that even a modest allocation of
resources will permit the financing of an exten¬
sive range of educational and primary health
care services. Social services, and increasingly
research, are an area in which the countries of the
South retain their greatest comparative edge.
Finally, one traditional sector must not
go unmentioned, i.e. public works which are
imperative in countries that lack adequate infra¬
structures, to say nothing of low-cost housing.
However, although their importance is acknowl¬
edged in theory, very little is being done as yet
in practice.

The culture of silence
by Aminata Traoré
My point of view is that of a woman from one of the world's
poorest countries, Mali. The word development has no equiv¬
alent in our local languages. It is primarily an imported theoretical con¬
struct, which has left a mark on our individual and collective lives and
given rise to some surrealist situations.
TERRIBLE HUMAN DAMAGE
In material terms the result of development can be gauged from the
dilapidated state of our infrastructure and from the extent of insalubrity
and mendicity. In mental terms the damage is even greater, though less
easy to evaluate. Under colonialism, and more insidiously during the
last thirty years, self-contempt has been continually instilled into
us. This has profoundly undermined African societies,
Our birth rate is a nuisance; people think we are poor because there
are too many of us. But they forget that without young people there
would never have been democracy in Mali, for it was they who took to
the streets and did what adults no longer dared to do. People do not
realize the tragedy of their lives. Young people represent 60 per cent
of the African population. What future can they look forward to?
DISENCHANTMENT
Nobody talks about the real causes of the failure of development.
Nobody talks about all the waste, or the way this crazy debt has been
contracted. On the ground the process goes quietly on, with its suc¬
cession of senseless projects and programmes. Young people and their
parents do not know about this debt; they do not know that their pre¬
sent and future are mortgaged; they do not know that the World
Bank even exists. Newly elected representatives need fresh money,
and so they keep quiet and let the projects started under previous gov¬
ernments go on. African research workers talking to foreign research
workers also keep their mouths shut, because they are ambitious to
get jobs in international organizations. On the spot, despite the insti¬
tutions' good faith, we deal only with arrogant, pretentious people who
listen to nobody.
It is as though a culture of silence has developed. On the one side
are the so-called illiterate people, entitled neither to information nor
to the truth, and on the other are the decision-makers who prefer to
keep quiet. As for illiteracy, it is not a blemish. My mother, watching
some of your television, said to me: "It seems to me as though hearts
no longer love one another. All this development business is a story
of disenchantment; everybody feels anger towards everybody else".

EMPOWERMENT
An escape route from

June Jordan "Calling on All Silent
Minorities" (1989)
-
14
This poem by African-American poet June
Jordan is about the process of empowerment. It
urges those without a voice to find their collec¬
tive voice, to get out there and meet and discuss
and make demands.
There are, according to United Nations esti¬
mates, about 1.3 billion people in the devel¬
oping world living in poverty. If we add to these
the people who live near the edge of absolute
poverty, the world's poor would easily rise
above 2 billion people. That is more than a third
of world population a silent minority on a
global scale.
Economic growth has not trickled down to
them. On the contrary. To all intents and pur¬
poses, the poor are excluded from "develop¬
ment".
The failure of economic policies over the
last thirty years to address the plight of the
world's poor requires that we rethink first the
very definition and interpretation of poverty, and
second what solutions are appropriate.
Our new definition centres on the notion of
poverty as disempowerment, and we argue for
a politics of collective self-empowerment on
the part of the world's poor, complemented by
certain new state policies.
The old theory of poverty
The United Nations figures on poverty cited
above are derived by calculating a "poverty
line" which is expressed in money terms,
whereby the poor are defined according to their
ability (actually inability) to consume. Although
household income is sometimes used in sur¬
veys, the usual emphasis is on the individual.
This understanding of poverty fits neatly
with the assumptions of neo-classical econo¬
mists, wherein the population is roughly divided
into producers and consumers. Both are treated
individually. Individuals enter labour markets,
and what their labour earns, they consume,
sharing their income with whomever they choose.
]]>

<![CDATA[
According to this theory, the situation of
the poor may be improved by increasing the
productivity of labour, by redistribution of
income through various forms of subsidies and
welfare programmes, and by the (increasingly
faint) hope of "trickle down".
This neo-classical model makes invisible the
huge amount of work that takes place outside the
market, specificially, work that is performed
inside the household economy. For the most part
this work is done by women and children, and its
object is the social reproduction of the household
and its members. Perhaps each household should
be seen as a small group of producers who have
joined together to produce their life and liveli¬
hood. This production of life and livelihood
includes work that results in paid income, but it
gives equal worth to the unpaid work of house¬
hold members. In short, it acknowledges the
value of the moral economy of the household,
which is based on reciprocity and affection, as dis¬
tinct from the market, which is based on profit.
The household economy is double-edged. It
is both the smallest unit for the self-produc¬
tion of life and livelihood, and the smallest polit¬
ical community. As such, it involves both co¬
operation and conflict, both a "collective" and
a conflictive arrangement among individuals
with greater and lesser degrees of dependence on
each other, and with claims on the household
and its distribution of resources.
empowerment
Those who are relatively well off can claim to be
relatively empowered, because they have rea¬
sonable access to resources that enable them to
pursue the ends of life that they value. Those
who lack such access are relatively disempow-
ered, or poor.
There are three kinds of disempowerment:
psychological, social and political. Psychological
disempowerment has to do with low self-esteem.
Social disempowerment means having little or 15

no access to the bases of social power. Political
disempowerment means having no say in how
one's life is shaped and determined within the
political communities in which one moves.
All three forms of disempowerment are
important in the definition of poverty and in the
ways of escaping from poverty. To begin the
long climb out of poverty, all three forms of
power must come together and be engaged.
Here we will emphasize social disempow¬
erment. From the perspective of the household,
eight bases of social power are crucial: a pro¬
tected life space; surplus time over and above the
time needed for the maintenance of life and
livelihood; social organization; social networks;
knowledge and skills; information related to
using existing knowledge and skills; tools and
instruments of production, including good
health; and, finally, financial resources.
The bonds of family and community
A protected life space is the most basic condition
for the production of life and livelihood. This
implies housing and, in the case of rural settle¬
ments, access to productive land. Landless
labourers and unhoused households in cities
are among the poorest, most disempowered
segments of a population.
But households also need connections to
the world beyond their walls. They need social
organization and social networks. This includes
the bonds of family, of community, and of net¬
works of individuals (friends, work compan¬
ions, quasi-kin, patrons, and so on) who operate
largely on the basis of reciprocity.
"The production of life and
livelihood in the household
acknowledges the value of the
household's moral economy,
which is based on reciprocity
and affection." Above, mother
and daughter in Cairo (Egypt).
A co-operative grain mill in a
Burkina Faso village.
Reinforcing and strengthening these connec¬
tions between household and community must
be worked at, which involves investments of
time, care and effort. (By community we mean
social organizations based in local neighbour¬
hoods where people know each other and where
relations of personal trust can be established.)
The production of life and livelihood is a
social process that requires co-operation. In the
case of poor households, the dependence of mem¬
bers on each other, on family, friends, neigh¬
bours and social organizations, is substantial.
But before these social relations can be mean¬
ingfully engaged, an even more fundamental con¬
dition of social power comes into play: surplus
time, in the context of protected life space.

Households obviously need the relative secu¬
rity of a home. But they also need to have time,
over and above that needed for subsistence at
present levels, in order to improve their life
conditions.
Whether it is political action, starting a small
business, participating in community affairs, or
contributing with sweat equity to the con¬
struction or improvement of their home, time
has to be salvaged. This could mean living closer
to the centre of the city, to minimize commuting;
having child care services available during the
day; having access to piped water; having basic
community facilities nearby. These are only a
few examples of what might save on and release
time for other (productive, political, commu¬
nity-building) activities.
There are, however, limits to what poor
households can do for themselves. The inter¬
vention of the state is still needed.
The importance of the state
Access to productive land and to housing, for
instance, cannot usually be generated exclu¬
sively from within poor communities. Access to
the use of land is regulated by the state, and
housing aid and investments for poor people
must come from the state. The same is true for
surplus time. Household and community efforts
are basic, but action by the state is required, for
example, in water and sewerage service provi¬
sion, in transport facilities, in the location of
new settlements and so on.
Now it is one thing to argue that states have
a responsibility to act in these ways, and quite
another to get states to use their powers on
behalf of poor people's livelihoods. States do
not act out of benevolence but because they are
politically pressured to do so. The development
of a politics of poor people's movements is
essential. The object of such a politics is to call
the attention of the state to the basic needs of the
poor, and to pressure governments to act on
behalf of these needs.
Successful political and other collective
actions are very empowering psychologically to
those who participate in them. And political
and collective action in securing rights of access
to the bases of social power draws particularly
on the strength, leadership and imagination of
women. For women, such struggles are empow¬
ering in a special sense, as they emerge from
the privacy of their households into the public
sphere of community-based action on behalf
of their own families.
But state actions when states respond at

all can be both empowering and disempow-
ering. When solutions are imposed from above,
they are disempowering to both poor people and
their communities. Solutions are empowering
when they work through democratic, partici¬
patory processes in which the energy and inven¬
tiveness of communities are directly engaged.
Solutions to problems of livelihood are most
meaningful when they are tailored to commu¬
nity conditions and needs and involve the active
collaboration of the organized community.
States have found it convenient to rely on
non-governmental organizations for meeting
some of the needs of poor people, and much
good has been done in this way. But the
resources devoted to non-governmental efforts
are woefully inadequate when faced with the
massive needs of poor people.
The state alone has the resources and the
legislative powers to address the problems of
life and livelihood of the disempowered on a
scale that begins to be meaningful.
Our model of poverty as disempowerment
has a number of advantages over the old bureau¬
cratic model based on neo-classical assump¬
tions. It acknowledges and includes the impor¬
tance of non-market work. It validates
co-operative action, inherent in the produc¬
tion-orientation of the model (as opposed to
the consumer-based individualism of neo-clas¬
sical economics). It argues for an anti-poverty
strategy that is based on the needs of life and
livelihood rather than on the logic of accumu¬
lation. And it envisions anti-poverty strategies
that combine individual and collective forms
of psychological, social and political empower¬
ment. Finally, our model acknowledges the role
of the state in improving the access of the dis¬
empowered poor to the bases of social power,
while emphasizing that any state intervention
must be democratic and participatory, strength¬
ening civil society.

of launching a garbage-recycling programme

the 600 tons of garbage thrown into the street
each day and then sell recyclable material at
one of 150 "shops" forming part of a buyers'
co-operative. One quarter of the city's waste
is sent for recycling In this way. After three
years' efforts the rag-pickers have succeeded
in forming their own trade union which defends
their rights and today has 4,000 card-carrying
members.

South Africa: leaving apartheid behind
by Roger Meunier
A reconstruction
programme for a
country with a
ruinous heritage
20
ROGER MEUNIER,
of France, is a staff member of
the School of Advanced Studies
in Social Sciences (EHESS) In
Paris. A member of the southern
Africa research group at his
country's National Centre for
Scientific Research (CNRS), he
is currently working on problems
of agriculture and agrarian
reform in South Africa.
I The new South Africa is on the move.
I Representatives of the whole nation, now
headed by Nelson Mandela, are still working on
a final draft of the constitution. Meanwhile, they
have already embarked on a reconstruction and
development programme. This is a package of
social and economic measures which will make it
possible, now that political equality has been
achieved, to erase the terrible consequences of
over a hundred years of colonial plunder and
nearly half a century of government whose very
foundations rested on a policy of social exclusion.
The task at hand is all the more daunting
because the final years of apartheid resulted in
a serious economic crisis, a downturn in invest¬
ment, an appreciable decrease in national wealth
and the institutionalization of regional inequal¬
ities. The self-governing and supposedly inde¬
pendent Bantustans (Transkei, Ciskei,
Bophuthatswana and Venda), which now once
again form an integral part of the South African
national framework, were pockets of destitution,
overpopulation and environmental disaster.
Even today, there are those who refuse to
accept the apartheid regime's responsibility for
the maldevelopment of South Africa. The appro
priation by the white minority of the lion's
share of the country's wealth tends to be
regarded by its beneficiaries more as the natural
result of economic laws or a legitimate reward
for hard work and expertise than as the product
of massive overexploitation based on political
domination and racial discrimination.
A ruinous social and economic
heritage
In fact, the years of growth leading up to 1980
were a time when inequalities increased in every
sphere and the great majority of the rural black
population were impoverished. The scale of the
phenomenon can be gauged from the findings of
a nationwide survey on poverty carried out by
hundreds of researchers in the early 1980s.
The survey painted a damning picture of the
predicament faced by millions of South Africans
in meeting their basic needs for water, energy,
food, housings work, medical care and education.
The problem of water is particularly
revealing. White homes have two or three water
taps per inhabitant, and middle-class residences
are often graced with a swimming pool. But in

Cape Province, it is not unusual for several hun¬
dred inhabitants to share the use of a single
water-supply point. In rural areas the situation
is often even worse: a study of three Transkei vil¬
lages showed that members of each household
spent an average of more than three hours a
day fetching and carrying water. The quality of
the water available to the poor is so low that they
have to buy drinking water at a price tens of
times higher than that paid by the more privi¬
leged. The same goes for energy: photographs
showing women carrying heavy loads of fire¬
wood against a background of electricity pylons
are familiar to everyone.
Uemocracy and the fight against
poverty
In a speech he gave at Atlanta University a few
months before coming to power, Nelson Man¬
dela summed up the situation as follows: "A
democratic constitution must address the issues
of poverty, inequality, deprivation and want in
accordance with the internationally recognized
standards of the indivisibility of human rights.
A vote without food, shelter, and health care
would be to create the appearance of equality
while actual inequality is entrenched. We do
not want freedom without bread, nor do we
want bread without freedom."
Representatives of the nationalist movement
(the African National Congress) long believed
that the best way to achieve this kind of justice
was to bring the whole economy under public
control in a manner modelled on the Soviet,
Chinese and Cuban revolutions. This approach
has been comprehensively called into question.
The reconstruction and development pro¬
gramme now being implemented by the gov¬
ernment of national unity is clearly geared to a
market economy. It gives priority to the absolute
need for national cohesion rather than the redis¬
tribution of wealth. It takes for granted that
there can be no policy of growth without the
confidence of domestic and international
investors, or without the trust of the nation's
elites, whose departure could result as it has
elsewhere in South Africa making a great leap
backwards.
The aim is to meet people's basic needs while
making as few changes as possible to South
Africa's general macro-economic equilibrium
and production structure. As regards housing,
ambitious targets have been set: within five
years, the number of homes built annually is due
to rise from 50,000 to 300,000. By the year 2000,
2.5 million homes and all schools will have elec¬
tricity. Running water and medical care will
also become generally available. Sweeping
agrarian reforms will provide for part of the 85
per cent of land appropriated by whites to be
returned to the dispossessed. The public works
policy that is part of the programme should
create many jobs.
There remains the problem of financing such
a programme. Several possible solutions are being
looked at. They include a rationalization of the
administrative system, a decrease in some military
spending, the creation of a development fund
for certain long-term investments, and a limita¬
tion on the use of international financing.

Change from within
by Peter Anyang Nyong'o
Governments in the South are kept in power through a combi¬
nation of internal and external factors. In the 1960s and
1970s, it was easy for authoritarian regimes to remain in power in
Africa. Thanks to revenues earned from mining and agriculture, and
with the help of the West, a cohabitation could easily be sustained
between bureaucratic elites and popular masses. The state had
enough resources to maintain the elite while supporting the con¬
sumption of the masses. But this led to an increase in state debt, and
when state revenues began to decrease and foreign aid diminished,
cohabitation between the bourgeoisie and the mass was blown away
and popular rebellion exploded. This rebellion took the form of ethnic
conflicts, religious and secessionist movements, and various move¬
ments in the name of democracy. . . . While it is true that popular rebel¬
lion now expresses itself through a strong demand for democratization,
it should not be forgotten that the success of democratization will
depend largely on the availability of resources such as land for agri¬
cultural production, technology to transform raw materials into man¬
ufactured goods, and a trained and skilled workforce, workers and deci¬
sion-makers alike.
THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
But if the powerful continue to deny the developing world its share of
development resources, to maintain unfair trade relations and biased
investment protocols, it will not be possible to establish the proper con¬
ditions of development without breaking away from these patterns.
Global economic policies and relations must be democratized.
There are many examples of inept projects conceived by Western
companies and supported by their governments and by the corrupted
elites of countries of the South. Whenever the forces of opposition have
wanted to establish responsibility for the failures which resulted from
these projects, Western governments have sided with the corrupt gov¬
ernments in power. The success of inner change necessarily depends
on how international relations evolve.
DEVELOPMENT, CHANGE AND DEMOCRACY
Of course nothing will be done without a leadership that is com¬
mitted to the well-being of populations. Some believe that non-gov¬
ernmental agencies can take over responsibility for development In the
Third World. That is an illusion. These organizations may provide
medicine and dispensaries, and help women's groups in their endeav¬
ours, but they will not be able to construct roads or railways or create
an infrastructure for health and education. Only national governments
can fulfill that role.
Most of all, change has to come from within. The emergence of
new leaders has to be encouraged, leaders who can guide their fellow
citizens and who are genuinely committed to development and change,
without ever losing sight of democratic principles. Otherwise, debt and
underdevelopment will be perpetuated and governments will con¬
tinue to repress and neglect people's demands. These new leaders
should be real trustees of the people and not mere inheritors of on-going
privileges.
'Sweeping agrarian reforms will
provide for part of the 85 per cent
of land appropriated by whites to
be returned to the dispossessed.'
But the crux of the programme is the redis¬
tribution of existing resources so that the needs
of the most underprivileged can be met. It is
impossible, for example, to increase education
spending on a massive scale (it already accounts
for 7 per cent of GNP and 24 per cent of the
budget). But it will be possible to devote a bigger
slice of it to the generalization of high-quality pri¬
mary education by calling on higher education
institutions to shoulder a greater share of their
costs. Similarly, the agrarian reforms will be partly
funded by reducing the subsidies that now go to
big commercial farms run by whites. In the elec¬
tricity and water sectors, new pricing systems
will provide the necessary funding: a transfer of
resources will take place between the present
beneficiaries of existing networks, who are often
large-scale consumers, and those who have not
yet been connected up to the network.
Quite apart from the purely financial aspects,
the success of such a programme hinges on two
crucial factors. First, there must be a social and
political consensus. The well-to-do minority,
consisting overwhelmingly of whites, will have
to accept a number of sacrifices. As for the vic¬
tims of apartheid, they will have to curb their
impatience and accept that priority be given to
the most underprivileged members of their com¬
munity. The second key factor is the ability of
the new government to marshal a competent
and highly-motivated administration. Given
the difficult situation it has inherited, this will be
no easy task.

I Pronasol, the National Solidarity Pro¬

a model in the fight against poverty. It has three
priorities: to improve the living conditions of the
rural population, the Indians and people living
in working-class urban districts; to promote
regional development and create the produc¬
tive basis for a higher standard of living; and to
strengthen the participation of social organiza¬
tions and local authorities in development.

economist, is a lecturer in
economics at the Institute of
Advanced Latin American
Studies (IHEAL) in Paris. He is
the author of "Le développement
est-il dans l'impasse?", a study

to concentrate public action on extreme poverty
and, secondly, to make contracts with the social
groups concerned so that they can share the
costs and assume administrative responsibility
for social projects carried out jointly.
The aim is to limit and reduce the costs of
social intervention by the state, but above all to
make this aid more effective and more equi¬
table. After 1981, economic management
marked by an increase in external debt led to the "
worsening of inequalities and poverty in Mexico.
Between 1981 and 1987, the number of poor
people rose by 9.2 million and the number of the
extremely poor by 3.6 million (the population
increased by 9.8 million in the same period).
While unemployment and underemployment
among the active population rose (from 12.8
per cent to 29 per cent between 1982 and 1989),
social expenditure decreased.
Nobody denies the beneficial effects that
Pronasol may have on social infrastructures,
but it seems doubtful whether it can eliminate
poverty. All the same, it remains a valuable
supplementary policy which has the merit of
stabilizing the number of poor people, if not the
ranks of the extremely poor. Will it be enough
to prevent outbreaks of popular discontent?
By responding after the event to the deteriora¬
tion of poverty and inequalities, the state is
acting as a social fire brigade. The shocks stem¬
ming from economic liberalization measures
and the resulting trade deficit are paralyzing
the resumption of growth. The Chiapas upris¬
ings may simply mark the beginning of a
broader movement.
Little room for manoeuvre
PronasoFs record shows how narrow is the
path, for all Latin American governments, which
reconciles opening up the economy with polit¬
ical democratization. The priority given to the
fight against extreme poverty soon proved inef¬
fectual without an economic recovery that
would improve the distribution of income by
raising levels of employment and earnings and
providing room for manoeuvre to finance social
expenditure.
The Mexican case seems to be particularly
significant. The fight against extreme poverty
which is waged on a broad and deep front in this
society (this is not just a pilot experiment of
the kind that can be observed in some other
Third World countries) also reflects the limits

encountered by all reform in the direction of lib¬
eralization. A social policy of this kind is no
remedy for extreme poverty; at best, it helps to
integrate people who are excluded from the
social protection linked to paid employment.
Certainly this is a "consolidation" of democ¬
racy which extends citizenship to a growing
percentage of the population. One of the most
original features of Pronasol is that its corner¬
stone consists of more than 80,000 "solidarity
committees" which put forward requests for
action and follow them up. Through their num¬
bers and the flexibility of their organization,
they provide a new sphere of collective decision¬
making open to those who have hitherto taken
no part in the corporative structures which con¬
trol the distribution of social benefits. The inno¬
vative feature is the room for manoeuvre open
to community leaders, who can either use these
structures or not, as they see fit.
The distribution of Pronasol's financial
resources establishes a direct link between the
central government and local authorities. Many
analysts believe that Pronasol points the way to
a kind of neo-corporatism which could mod¬
ernize clientelism by giving it roots not only in
the trade unions, as in the past, but also at the ter¬
ritorial level and by giving political weight to the
new social actors who have emerged from the
neighbourhood associations.
Pronasol thus reflects a remarkable social
opening. All the parties agree that it is evidence
of a new political determination to broaden the
social base of the state. But it is clear today that
it guarantees neither social peace nor the tran¬
sition to democracy. What some observers had
called the "Mexican model to recover from
crisis" is certainly not a panacea.
With the passage of time, the limits of
Pronasol have become clear. An effective fight
against poverty must be accompanied by a
return to economic growth. But it is hard to
imagine how growth could resume without
more resolute public intervention designed to
improve the job situation and wages, thus revi¬
talizing the domestic market. Social policy must
be the spearhead of a development strategy that
lives up to its promises.
An ethical
commitment
by Devaki Jain
Not everyone shares the pessimistic view of development that
seems to be in the air. Development is the mirror of social
action and the result of an active civil society. In the field we are
resisting development that brings economic growth without bringing
jobs, and this resistance is wasting a lot of our energy. We are
trying to reconstruct on a local level, using our natural resources to
protect our environments against destruction.
GANDHI'S MODEL
Ethics and development go together, and Mahatma Gandhi was suc¬
cessful in combining the two. He implemented a growth model
based on "bubble-up" rather than "trickle-down" economics. This calls
for two basic reforms:
A political reform: government must be decentralized and run by
democratically elected local officials. But political decentralization
is only viable if it is accompanied by economic and technological
decentralization as well.
-* An economic reform: attention should be focused on the poorest
of the poor, who should be at the core of our preoccupations.
India, for example, recently adopted a reform that extends the
power of local government while giving the poor a much greater share
of representation (30 per cent for women and 30 per cent for lower
castes).
MAKING UTOPIA A REALITY
Much is said about alleviating poverty but not about eradicating it.
I believe, however, that the eradication of poverty is the key to sus¬
tainable development. We have to build up economic development
within a framework of justice. To accomplish that, North and South
have to show solidarity. But first the North must become more
democratic by changing its economic policies and allowing its
society to play a bigger role. Personal commitment, solidarity in
thought and action, moral imperatives, ethics, sacrifice, altruism and
confidence in the people's competence, are all key values in the
struggle for development. Intellectuals should mobilize so as to
give these ideas a wider audience. Utopia must be given a chance.

Brazil: a country in arms against
hunger by Herbert de Souza
26
Spurred by a citizens' campaign, the mobilization of Brazilian
society against poverty marked the birth of a new political
awareness
Hunger and unemployment have become
blots on the world. They haunt the faces
of Somali refugees and the street children of
Rio. There are 35 million unemployed in the
world's seven wealthiest nations, and in Brazil
alone there are 20 million workers for whom
having a job does not even mean that they will
be able to eat their fill.
"Above all, I am a human In 1 "3 Brazil invented an oriSinaI waX of
being." Above, street children tackling these complex problems. It is known as
demonstrate in Rio de Janeiro. the Citizens' Action Campaign against Poverty
and for Life (ACF), and its 3,000 committees
nationwide have managed to mobilize all of
Brazilian society to relieve the hunger of 32
million persons.
The committees were spontaneously and
independently set up in communities, compa¬
nies, churches, non-governmental organiza¬
tions, trade unions, neighbourhood associations
and schools.
The results of a 1993 survey showed that 96
per cent of the persons polled approved of the
campaign and that 32 per cent had either con¬
tributed financially or offered their time to it.
These surprising and telling figures show that
something can be done, and that appealing to
people's civic spirit is not a waste of time. Brazil's

work at the campaign's disposal, and employees
in nearly 2,000 of its 3,000 branches have vol¬
unteered to collect and distribute food, build
shelters and crèches and mobilize public opinion
in 1,500 Brazilian towns.
Public sector businesses were not to be out¬
done. Some thirty of them today belong to an
extremely active support committee. The private
sector also pitched in, and the C 6c A Institute
of Social Development (Instituto C & A de
Desenvolvimento Social) allocated about $2 mil¬
lion last year to projects on behalf of needy
communities. All the religious faiths have com¬
bined their efforts and established an interde¬
nominational fund that has received donations
for underprivileged children amounting to
almost $600,000. Brazilian university students
have enthusiastically supported the campaign by
organizing meetings and debates on the causes
of hunger and its possible solutions. The civil
service has also been very active; regional offi¬
cials have worked with citizens' committees on
a range of measures against hunger and unem¬
ployment.
Uonations from businesses, the
performing arts and prisons
But the most high-profile responses have come
from the performing arts. Right from the start
actors and singers organized supporting events
all over the country. For months, before every
performance, actors in Rio and Sao Paolo
appealed to their audiences to support the cam¬
paign. Some theatres accepted food as payment
for tickets. The campaign was carried into music
halls, cinemas and onto television, and gave rise
to a gigantic "happening" in which 500 per¬
formers took part in a Week of Art against
Hunger, inspired by the famous Week of
Modern Art held in Sào Paulo in 1922. Chico
Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and
other singers took part in concerts held in many
parts of Brazil.
Perhaps the most amazing reaction came
from the female inmates of Rio's Talavera Bruce
prison. They came up with the idea of asking
prisoners in nine other institutions to give part
of their food rations to the anti-hunger campaign
and were able to gather 2.5 tons of provisions
that were used to feed some 200 needy families
for a fortnight in November 1993.
Brazilians living abroad demonstrated their
solidarity by creating support committees in
France, Switzerland, Italy, the United States,
Japan, Finland, Australia and Chile to collect
funds for the inhabitants of the southern
Brazilian states, especially hard hit by a very
severe winter.
Lifting the curtain of indifference
None of this would have been possible if
Brazilian society had not discovered a new
decentralized way of organizing itself and prac¬
tising politics at grassroots level, relying on
individual initiative and a partnership between
generosity and need to lift the heavy curtain of
indifference between the middle and upper
classes and the reality of hunger and poverty.
For the state, the campaign was an oppor¬
tunity to innovate. The President set up a
National Council for Food Security (Conselho
Nacional de Segurança Alimantar) in which
nine ministers and twenty-one representatives
from civil society met to see what the authori¬
ties could do about hunger. It was through this
mechanism that the citizens more or less forced
the state to organize a massive distribution of
provisions to 2 million drought-stricken fami¬
lies in the northeast. In a country the size of a

8,500,000 km2) transporting and distributing
more than 7.5 million staple rations of rice,
beans, wheat, salt and oil was a major operation.
Today, a year after taking to the streets, ACF
has shown Brazilians a new kind of politics
based on principles and reflexes that have always
been latent in their country. The first sign of this
change was the discovery of a new feeling in
Brazil, the feeling that things could be done on
the initiative of society rather than the state.
This gave rise to an entirely new way of looking
at politics.
The first new factor was the realization that
decentralization works. ACF has neither leaders,
nor political slogans nor a central committee. It
simply encourages a sense of individual initiative
and responsibility (what the institutional left
calls "spontaneism"). The campaign has showed
that the capacity of citizens to mobilize should
not be underestimated. For the first time they
prevailed over society, and society over the state.
A political turning point
The media have played a decisive role in alerting
public opinion to a problem which had hitherto
been widely and scandalously ignored. One of
the first ads broadcast free of charge on televi¬
sion summed up the general mood. It showed a
driver, clearly a wealthy member of society,
stopped at a red light, hurriedly rolling up his
window when he sees a skinny, sad-faced street
urchin coming his way for a handout. When
the light turns green, the car roars off, leaving the
boy empty-handed. At market rates it would
have cost ACF $5 million to run this and other
similar ads on Globo TV (the country's main
network with 80 per cent of the market) for six
months!
Hunger became a major issue in the 1994
election campaign because television showed
the general public (as the newspapers showed the
elites) that hunger is an ethical matter, that
democracy cannot accept poverty and that no
country has the right to turn a blind eye to 32
million needy citizens. By now it was impossible
for candidates and voters to ignore a problem
that the whole of Brazilian society had grown
familiar with. No one could forget that there
were 32 million hungry Brazilians.
When the first accusations of corruption
emerged in 1992 against the then President,
nearly 900 citizens' associations, backed by
public opinion, combined in a movement
defending morality in politics to demand his
ouster. Brazilians took to the streets (their faces
painted with the national colours), there were
student demonstrations, and the media rallied
public opinion. The president was forced to
resign, and democracy won the day. In the wake
of this victory the movement's leaders decided
to create ACF.
During the election campaign which led to
the election by universal suffrage of the new
president the second to be democratically
elected after a long period of military dictator¬
ship ACF activists monitored the campaign's
moral aspect, urging various candidates on all
power levels to take a stand on the hunger issue.
In Brazil there are 2 million child workers
between the ages of 10 and 13, whites are paid
twice as much as blacks, and men twice as much
as women. The minimum wage is $65 a week,
but millions of peasants work more than 40
hours a week and do not even earn that paltry
amount. The average monthly wage may be
$280, but 28 million persons share 10 per cent of
GNP and just under 5.6 million privileged
Brazilians control half of it.
The present model of development has failed.
For most Brazilians the wealth that has been
accumulating for decades means nothing. That

Brazil has become the ninth richest country in
the world is a joke to them. And the solutions
recently adopted at the instigation of the major
economic powers have only led to worse
poverty.
Citizens working at grassroots level are
thinking about the ethical issues as they start to
build a new socio-economic model that ques¬
tions the role of the state, the market and private
enterprise.
In 1993 and 1994 the Campaign against
Hunger demonstrated that the development
model that creates poverty and exclusion is nei¬
ther irreversible nor inevitable, and that it should
not be accepted fatalistically. The fight against
hunger augurs well for the future. It began by
rejecting what seemed unavoidable. It enabled
people to say, "We can and must all be able to eat,
work, have a roof over our heads, medical care,
basic facilities and access to education and cul¬
ture. Everyone has a right to human dignity
and citizenship."
Much, of course, remains to be done, but at
least the wind of change has blown into Brazil.
ACF's optimism is that of people who know that
the struggle has only just begun.
Hoping against hope
by Edgar Morin
Development is a key word which has run through all political ide¬
ologies, but it has never been thought out in depth. At present three
revolutions are taking place in the field of knowledge, particularly in
science. They will give rise to a new analysis of development:
Science used to think that it could state certainties: we now know
that room must be found for uncertainty;
Science used to think it could deal with problems separately from
each other, but everything that is linked to a context and to a
system can no longer be isolated;
It used to be accepted that a single rationalizing logic sufficed
for understanding reality. Rationality has now opened itself to new
logics.
DOUBTS ABOUT DEVELOPMENT
These revolutions have thrown doubt on the presupposition that
progress has only positive consequences and leads inevitably to the
development of humankind. We now know that technology is ambiva¬
lent and that both people and nature need to be protected from its
negative effects.
We can see that economic issues cannot be separated from
social, human and cultural issues. So long as the link between eco¬
nomic and non-economic factors was concealed, everything that could
not be quantified was neglected. Intellectually satisfying economic
models were constructed, but they were not capable of taking
account of reality. We have so far not taken account of the destruc¬
tive effects of technical and economic development on our cultural
heritage and on nature. These destructive effects explain why fun¬
damentalism is gaining many devotees and finding leaders among intel¬
lectuals who possess the tools of modern knowledge but have been
disappointed by it.
So it is the end of the euphoric concept of development, which
favoured the idea of a single model applicable to ail situations.
A NEW APPROACH
nbleThe notion of development must be put back into an ensem l
encompassing nature, history, society and culture. But we still lack
an awareness of a common earthly destiny. We must foster the
growth of a kind of human solidarity based on a uterine link between
people, for instance the idea of an earth-motherland. As the poet
Machado put it, "Hiker, there is no road; you make the road by
walking". We need to seek a new way, trying to draw inspiration from
Heraclitus's thought, "You cannot hope if you do not seek the
unhoped-for".

SOME FACTS AND FIGURES
30
Developing countries devote on average
only 13% of their national budgets ($57 billion
a year) to basic human development concerns.
On average, bilateral donor countries allo¬
cate only 7% of their aid to the various human
priority concerns (basic education, primary
health care, mass-coverage water supply sys¬
tems and family planning services).
In the past two decades, the number of
jobs in industrial countries has increased at only
half the rate of GDP growth and failed to keep
pace with the growth in the labour force. By
1993, more than 35 million people were
seeking work, and a high proportion were
women.
In developing countries, registered unem¬
ployment is commonly above 10%, and total
unemployment probably way beyond that.
The overall availability of food in the world
is not a problem. There is enough food to offer
everybody in the world around 2,500 calories
a day200 calories more than the basic min¬
imum.
Some 800 million people around the world
go hungry.
In developing countries, the major causes
of death are infectious and parasitic diseases,
which kill 17 million people annually.
In industrial countries, the major killers are
diseases of the circulatory system (5.5 million
deaths a year).
In the industrial countries, on average
there is 1 doctor for every 400 people, but for
the developing countries there is 1 for nearly
7,000 people (in sub-Saharan Africa the figure
is 1 per 36,000).
The widest gap between the North and
the South in any human indicator is in maternal
mortalitywhich is about 18 times greater
in the South.
At the beginning of this century, around
90% of war casualties were military. Today,
about 90% are civilian.

61:1
THE WORLD SUMMIT FOR SOCIAL
DEVELOPMENT
(COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, 6-12 MARCH 1995)
Why a "social" summit?
Instead of the social and economic progress that it seemed to promise,
the end of the cold war has given way to a "cold peace" reflected in wide¬
spread political fragmentation and social destabilization. Instead of
the long-awaited social harmony and affluence, poverty and unem¬
ployment are increasing and there is a growing sense of insecurity.
What has happened? In the words of United Nations Secretary-Gen¬
eral Boutros Boutros-Ghali, "the world is suffering from a social and
moral crisis which, in many societies, is of immense proportions".
A change of course is necessary.
Changing course is not so simple. . .
The problems are planetary. They must be addressed in a global context.
The international approach requires foresight, collaboration and con¬
sensus in order to formulate a truly global strategy to combat the inter¬
twined crises of poverty, unemployment and social disintegration.
... but it canand mustbe done
"The globalization of economies and culture", characterized by
increasing interdependence in everything from markets to population
movements and methods of decision-making, "should benefit all
people". It is the ultimate responsibility of governments to ensure that
the major problems of this decade poverty, unemployment and social
disintegration are addressed through principles based on social justice
and democracy and through actions built on respect for human dignity,
individual freedom and equality of rights and responsibilities.
The UN's role: in the forefront of social progress
The United Nations responded to socially deteriorating conditions
worldwide by calling for a World Summit for Social Development to
address three issues: poverty, unemployment and social disintegra¬
tion. This key event is one of a sequence of eight UN-sponsored con¬
ferences being held within the framework of the Fourth United Nations
Development Decade (1991-2000).
Putting people first
The World Summit for Social Development is the centrepiece of the
UN's commitment to put social issues at the centre of development.

Between 1987 and 1994, the decrease in military spending generated a
peace dividend of some $935 billion. Unfortunately, this peace dividend has
not been used to finance the world social agenda. During 1995-2000, if global
military spending were to continue declining by 3%, another $460 billion could
emerge as a peace dividend. The World Summit for Social Development pro¬
vides a unique opportunity to agree on capturing the potential peace divi¬
dend and translating It into improved human development.

COMMENTARY
Sharing our knowledge
32
I UNESCO's mission, whether
I it be in the natural sciences
or in the social and human sciences,
is to correct the glaring disparities
in the scientific research effort
being made throughout the world
and to promote the development of
scientific knowledge for its intrinsic value and for its
contribution to general education, but also to provide
the backing for social and economic development.
For UNESCO's science programmes cover the basic
sciences, the sciences applied to the environment and
the development of natural resources, and the engi¬
neering sciences. While UNESCO promotes the
advancement of the social and human sciences, it
also encourages their application to the management
of social transformations, as well as interdisciplinary
approaches to such complex problems as population,
development and the environment, the status of
women, and human rights, democracy and peace.
UNESCO regards the social sciences as an area of
knowledge that has to be strengthened but also believes
in using them to solve the main problems of humanity
and societies, in tune with its work in education, cul¬
ture and communication, its other areas of compe¬
tence. In so doing, it is helping to lay the foundations
on which the programmes of the other specialized
agencies of the United Nations system can be built.
UNESCO contributed to the creation of CERN, the
European Centre for Nuclear Research. Together
with the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the Italian government, it is responsible for admin¬
istering the International Centre for Theoretical
Physics in Trieste, which each year trains several
hundred researchers from developing countries. It
participated in the foundation of the International
Centre for Pure and Applied Mathematics in Nice,
and was instrumental in setting up two international
non-governmental research organizations, one on
the brain and the other on cells. It has also set up co¬
operation networks linking research institutes such
as the Microbial Resources Network and the Molec
ular and Cell Biology Network, and co-operation
mechanisms involving, for example, the human
genome and biotechnologies (the Biotechnology
Action Council).
This international and regional approach has been
applied in the launching of major intergovernmental
scientific programmes that bring together and stim¬
ulate national, regional and international activities.
This is the case of the activities of the Intergovern¬
mental Océanographie Commission, the Interna¬
tional Hydrological Programme, the Man and the
Biosphere Programme, the International Geological
Correlation Programme and, in the last year or so, the
Programme for the Management of Social Transfor¬
mations.
Human developmentpriorities
The goal common to all these activities is that of sus¬
tainable human development, which is recognized
as being both the prerequisite for peace in the world
and the prize to be won for its achievement. Sus¬
tainable human development has obvious priorities,
such as combating poverty, improving living condi¬
tions, especially in rural areas, preventing the accel¬
eration of the growing disparities between and within
nations, and establishing a more equitable interna¬
tional economic environment.
However, the priority in which UNESCO is specif¬
ically interested and which has a place in all its pro¬
grammes, especially in the sciences, is the development
of human resources, in other words, skills training
aimed at creating or strengthening endogenous capac¬
ities at national and local level. We should derive
great satisfaction from the fact that all the agencies
engaged in funding economic and social develop¬
ment projects I am thinking above all of the World
Bank and the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme now acknowledge that the enhancement of
human resources, the training of professionals and the
improvement of people's skills are all key factors in
development.

B Y F E D E R I C MAY i
In the few years now separating us from the next
century, our strategy will therefore consist in stepping
up the transfer and sharing of scientific knowledge
and in promoting its application to the development
of natural resources and the management of social
transformations. In this transfer, the importance of
the basic sciences should not be underestimated. As we
all know, "there are no applied sciences unless there are
sciences to apply". In sharing knowledge, it is impor¬
tant to remember the passing on of information as
well as skills. In briefing decision-makers, whether in
the private or public sectors, scientists contribute
decisively to a clear and rational understanding of
problems and of possible solutions to them.
Science and the decision-makers
This briefing function should not be confined to what
we regard as being recent advances in science; it is
essential, for example, to explain the scientific prin¬
ciples underlying traditional practices which might
otherwise be treated with undeserved contempt.
Obviously it also includes the publication of research
findings I am thinking, for example, of those
involving malaria or hydrophilic polymers.
In order to accelerate the transfer of knowledge,
UNESCO has set in motion a number of projects,
among which I would mention the UNITWIN pro¬
gramme, which involves twinning and co-operation
arrangements between universities and the setting up
of networks linking them; the project providing for
the granting of short-term fellowships to researchers
from developing countries; and the UNESCO chairs
programme under which scientists from the North
can go to countries of the South and help to train
their future colleagues in those countries. These forms
of knowledge-sharing are also clearly designed to
combat the brain drain and wastage of skills.
The primary aim of UNESCO's strategy regarding
the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development will be to find sound
scientific solutions to the problems involved in devel¬
oping natural resources and in managing social trans¬
formations and population issues, with a view to pro¬
moting sustainable human development. These
solutions will be based on the results of projects in
which research will be combined with educational,
training and information activities. The implemen
tation of this strategy will entail collaborating more
closely with scientists, engineers and technicians and
with their international, regional and national non¬
governmental organizations and professional asso¬
ciations, in order to increase and step up the pace of
the transfer and sharing of knowledge.
Networks ofco-operation
Such transfers and sharing will be brought about
by:
*" improving the relevance of higher education
and training by adapting syllabuses to new require¬
ments;
*" linking research more closely to training;
*~ establishing or strengthening links between
production sectors, industry and higher education
and research systems;
*" continuing activities designed to collect and dis¬
seminate scientific information;
*" consolidating co-operative networks in this
area.
In this connection, I would like to mention two
multidisciplinary programmes of international co¬
operation in Latin America and the Caribbean, the
Common Market of Knowledge (MECCO), an
extremely worthwhile venture, and the ENLACE
Plan, which is designed to foster co-operation between
industry, universities and research as part of the
"Bolivar" programme.
UNESCO's strategy will draw on increased collab¬
oration and synergy between the Organization's
intergovernmental programmes in the environ¬
mental and social sciences, in an endeavour to find
solutions to a number of urgent environmental and
development problems. Particular emphasis will be
placed on improving our knowledge of the working
of ecosystems, on the management of social trans¬
formations and on promoting environmental and
population information and education, in order to
encourage changes of attitude, especially among
young people, and inculcate behaviour patterns con¬
ducive to sustainable human development.
We shall also be trying to encourage small-scale
field projects that will help to foster a spirit of enter¬
prise, especially in rural areas, and induce people who
might be tempted by the mirage of urban life to
remain in their home environment. ^o

The stones of Byblos
by Sawsan Awada Jalu
Time and cultures have leftan indelible mark on Byblos in Lebanon,
trading centre of the ancient world and a cradle of the modern
alphabet
34
Above, the courtyard of the
temple of the obelisks.
Opposite page, the church of
St. John the Baptist, a fine
Romanesque building with
three apses (12th century).
The ancient Phoenician seaport of
Byblos (the biblical Gebal) on the
coast of Lebanon is reputed to be
the oldest continuously inhabited city in
the world, with a history stretching back
7,000 years to the time when the first com¬
munity of fishermen settled there.
Today the Lebanese town of Jbeil
stands on the site of Byblos, which in
ancient times maintained close ties with
the powerful empires of the Orient and
Mediterranean and was one of the great
cultural centres ofAntiquity.
The violence that has ravaged Lebanon
has left the narrow streets ofJbeil 's old souks
virtually unscathed. Here, as if reading a
book whose pages date back thousands of
years, the visitor can begin to retrace the
story of the serene city to which Yam, the
ancient god of the sea, was believed to have
given the fine natural harbour that for cen¬
turies brought it fame and fortune.

Avisittothe medieval town is the first stage
of a journey into the past of Byblos. The
decoration of the elegant baptistry of the
twelfth-century Romanesque church ofSt.
John the Baptist, once the cathedral of
Gibelet (as Byblos was called by the cru¬
saders), is a reminder that the citywas for a
time under the sway of the Genoese. Nearby,

Renan carried out the first excavations on
it in I860, but it was the work done by the
French archaeologist Pierre Montet
between 1920 and 1924 and continued by
his successor, Maurice Dunand, that did
most to reveal the secrets of the thousands
ofyears ofurban history that unfolded here.
Dunand discovered earthenware vases
ornamented with sea shell impressions,
dating from the sixth and fifth millennia,
great funeral urns and jars containing
grain, food, weapons and jewellery buried
between the aeneolithic dwellings. The
earliest shelters were simple cabins;
houses with stone walls were not built
until the end of the fourth millennium.
The first urban layout worthy of the
name multi-storied houses, a water
drainage system and ramparts reveals
the influence of Mesopotamia and Egypt.
Starting from the centre, a narrow, twisting
street ran through the town; little alleys
ran off it, winding their way between the
dwellings. A twenty-six-metre-long stretch
of the city wall has survived. Originally
supported on the inside by pillars four
metres square, it only enclosed the city
on the landward side. The rocky promon¬
tory on which Byblos was built provided a
natural rampart on the seaward side.
The land of the gods
The golden age ofByblos, in the third mil¬
lennium, is inseparable from its special
relationship with Egypt. There were
numerous temples in which the same gods
were worshipped as in Egypt. The
Pharaohs would send to Lebanon for
timber for their ships and the resinous
wood needed for mummification. In the
great temple dedicated to Baalat-Gebal
(remodelled and restored until Roman
times), vases bearing the names of
pharaohs have been found. They reveal
the veneration by the Egyptian sovereigns
of the "Lady of Byblos" (the Phoenician
goddess Astarte, paredros or secondary
deity of the god El, believed by the Phoeni¬
cians to have founded Byblos), who was
worshipped here for centuries.
The vestiges of another temple, in this
case dedicated to a male divinity, which
was destroyed by fire in 2150 B.C., and
those ofthe "Grand Residence", a vast and
luxurious villa, attest to the city's pros¬
perity at this period.
However, Dunand's major discoverywas
the "Temple of the Obelisks" (beginning of
the second millennium B.C.) and the
remarkable set of standing stones in its
courtyard. These small obelisks (between 0.5
and 2 metres high) symbolized the pres¬
ence of the faithful near their god, who was
himselfrepresented by an obelisk mounted
abutments dates back to the Byzantine era.
The imposing crusader castle whose
massive bulk dominates the town stands on
the site of a structure built by the Fatimids
of Egypt in the ninth century. Its stones
were taken from Phoenician and Roman
monuments. A fortress with vast vaulted
halls, it was begun in the twelfth century
and has been constanüy remodelled down
the centuries. From the top of the keep, the
visitor can look out over the vast archaeo¬
logical diggings of the ancient city, formed
by the superimposition and intertwining of
several ancient towns.

cities

on a pedestal. Perforated bronze, gold and
silver axes, daggers with repoussé gold scab¬
bards, bronze figurines covered in gold leaf
and other precious offerings unearthed in
the temple show the artistic refinement of
the local craftsmen.
Byblos was a great commercial and
artistic crossroads. Trade was conducted in
the east with Mesopotamia, in the south
with Egypt, in the north with the Hittite
empire and in the west, across the sea,
with the brilliant civilization of Crete.
Under Persian domination, Byblos
became a strategic point in the defence
system of the Persian empire in the eastern
Mediterranean. After its conquest by
Alexander the Great, it experienced a
period of enormous influence as a centre
for,the cult ofAdonis, a Phoenician divinity
who later entered the mythological pan¬
theon of Greece. In the Roman era, the
site was covered with temples and public
buildings. Excavation of a theatre dating
from the third century has revealed a beau¬
tiful mosaic floor.
The cradle of the Phoenician
alphabet and art
The territory of the Phoenicians was fertile
but too confined, and so they sought their
fortune elsewhere. The Phoenicians were
great navigators and shrewd merchants.
They are described in the Bible as talented
carpenters and ivory carvers who cut the
beams for the Temple ofSolomon and fash¬
ioned its chryselephantine decorations.
The earliest artistic evidence that has
survived consists of votive objects with
geometrical motifs of undeniable
orginality. They were discovered in the
ruins of the temple ofBaalat-Gebal. Highly
stylized zoomorphic vases strikingly cap¬
ture the movements and characteristic
postures of the animals they depict. If the
stylization is sometimes crude, it always
possesses the characteristic vividness of
Phoenician art which, as the French
archaeologist André Parrot has written,
was to become "an elegant and harmo¬
nious synthesis of all the finest and most
sophisticated features already achieved
by neighbouring civilizations".*
To meet the needs of merchants who
wanted contracts and invoices to be made
out rapidly, the scribes ofByblos ("byblos"
is the Greekword for papyrus, an Egyptian
productwhich reached Greece via the mer¬
chants of Byblos) developed a simplified
alphabet and writing system with just
twenty-two signs. Taken over by the Greeks
and Romans and propagated throughout
the Orient and Occident, this was the direct
ancestor of all the Western alphabets.

A CONTINUING
DIALOGUE
THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE
FOR THE HUMANITIES
Since Byblos was for so long a meeting-point
between civilizations, the idea arose in the
1960s of creating an international centre
there to encourage a dialogue between faiths
and cultures. In 1974, Unesco gave its support
to this Lebanese project, which was included
in the programme of its Philosophy Division
under the name of the "International Centre
for the Humanities and Development at
Byblos". The Centre's aim was "to study con¬
temporary man, his relations with nature and
society and the problems posed by develop¬
ment in all its different aspects".
After sixteen years of war had ravaged
Lebanon, an international symposium was
held at Unesco Headquarters in February 1992
in order to relaunch the idea of the Centre.
One of the participants pointed out that
despite the long conflict, Lebanon had
remained a land of coexistence, mutual accep¬
tance and dialogue and that at Byblos in par¬
ticular different religious communities had
continued to coexist in a climate of uninter¬
rupted tolerance.
Byblos, the setting of a brilliant synthesis
of the arts of the great civilizations of Antiq¬
uity and the birthplace of modern principles of
written communication, may again become a
crossroads of encounters, exchanges and
creation.

7,000 YEARS OF HISTORY
5000 B.C.: First human settlement on
the western part of the promontory.
3200 B.C.: Construction of stone houses
3000-2800 B.C.: Incipient urban orga¬
nization on the site. Occupation of the
entire promontory, construction of a ram¬
part and establishment of a water
drainage system. Byblos becomes a
centre for meetings and trade between
the great civilizations of Egypt and
Mesopotamia.
c. 2150 B.C.: The Amorites destroy
Byblos by fire.
c. 1950 B.C.: The city, temples and ram¬
parts are rebuilt and ties with Egypt are
restored. Trading activities extend as
far afield as the Caucasus and Crete.
1725 B.C.: The Hyksos invade Egypt and
the development of Byblos is interrupted.
1580 B.C.: Egypt expels the Hyksos and
makes Phoenicia its protectorate, thus
sheltering Phoenician civilization from
the invasions of the Mitannians and later
of the Hittites. Trade activities are
resumed in Byblos and flourish thanks to
the invention of the alphabetic system.
1200 B.C.: The power of Egypt wanes.
The region is threatened by the peoples
of the sea, and Tyr gains supremacy over
all the other Phoenician cities.
725 B.C.: Assyrian domination
612 B.C.: Babylonian domination
539 B.C.: Persian domination
332 B.C.: Hellenistic domination
63 B.C.: Roman domination
Despite these successive dominations,
Byblos experiences relative economic
prosperity. Above all, it is one of the
main religious centres of the Orient
(notably through the cult of Adonis). Its
sanctuaries are considered to have a
special aura and its religious festivals
attract great crowds.
638: At the time of the Muslim con¬
quest, the importance of Byblos declines.
1104: The town is captured by the cru¬
sader Raymond de Saint-Gilles. After
becoming the lordship of Gibelet, it is
entrusted to the Embriaco family of
Genoa in 1109. The era of the crusades
restores wealth and trade to Byblos.
1187: Saladin I recaptures Byblos, dis¬
mantles the crusader castle and razes
the ramparts.
1199: The city is recaptured by the
Franks.
1266: Byblos ceases to play a leading
role in history and becomes the peaceful
fishing port that it is today.
1960: Ratification by Lebanon of The
Hague Convention (Convention for the
Protection of Cultural Property in the
Event of Armed Conflict).
1984: Byblos, with Anjar, Baalbek and
Tyr, is included on Unesco's World Her¬
itage List.
1993: Application for inclusion of the
Lebanese World Heritage sites on the
"International Register of Cultural Prop¬
erty under Special Protection" of The
Hague Convention. 37

Man of action, writer and
political thinker, losé Martí
(1853-1895) was one of the
great architects of Latin
American consciousness
The first Cuban-born member of a
poor Spanish immigrant family,
José Martí (1853-1895) never
denied his Spanish roots but felt himself to
be first and foremost a son of the land of
his birth. As a child he witnessed the cru¬
elties of slavery and swore that he would
devote his life to "expunging this crime".
While still an adolescent, he fought against
colonialism, was sentenced to hard labour
and put in irons in a prison for political
activists. During his imprisonment, whose
horrors he later vividly denounced, he
paradoxically achieved spiritual freedom
and worked out a militant ethics that
would lead him to call for a war of libera¬
tion that was "necessary" but should be
waged "without hatred".
Exile in Madrid and Zaragossa, where
he pursued his university studies, strength¬
ened his affinities with the rebellious side
of the Spanish character but also his con¬
viction that Cuba could hope for nothing
from the rulers of Spain, whether they
were royalists or republicans. Visits to
Mexico, Guatemala and Venezuela famil¬
iarized him with the problems faced by
these newly independent republics still
fettered by the evils of colonialism. He
spent nearly fifteen years in the United
States, which he studied by analysing the
ideas of its founding fathers, the positive
and negative aspects of its social system,
the characteristics of its people and the
increasingly imperialist tendencies of its
government.
During these years he produced a flow
José Martí
Cuba's man ofdestiny
by Cintio Vitier
"I may fade away. But my thinking will not."
of notable literary and journalistic work,
especially after visiting Venezuela in 1 88 1 .
He was a man of many parts. The orator
who delivered a memorable speech to the
Caracas Chamber of Commerce, the edi¬
torialist who founded the Revista Vene¬
zolana ("Venezuelan Review"), the poet
who wrote Ismaelillo, and the author of the
preface to Juan Antonio Pérez Bonalde's
Poema del Niágara heralded the renais¬
sance ofHispano-American literature. After
his death on the battlefield at Dos Rios,
Rubén Darío, who would later become the
most conspicuous leader of this renais¬
sance, referred to him as the "Master".
Yet Marti did not devote his life to
making a literary reputation. He dedicated
his talents as an orator and journalist to
Cuba and to what he called in a memo¬
rable work, "Our America". His writings
helped to make this America become more
self-aware.
Throughout his life he was guided by a
sense ofethics, duty and sacrifice. When he
proclaimed the Cuban Revolutionary Party
on 10 April 1892 in New York, poor immi¬
grants in Florida revealingly dubbed him
the "Apostle", a man whose destiny tran¬
scended the political context. Earlier, on
26 November 1891, he had made a speech
at the University ofTampa in which he set
forth the foundations of a new Republic,
"With all and for the good ofall".
Marti then embarked on a period of
intensive revolutionary activity. He made
speeches, published articles in the Patria
newspaper, corresponded and travelled
constantly, notably in order to secure the
help of the two most distinguished gen¬
erals of the Ten Years' War between Cuba
and Spain (1868-1878), Maximo Gómez,
who was chosen as commander in chiefof
the Liberation Army, and Antonio Maceo.
In his Tampa speech Marti said, "Either
the Republic must be based on the
integrity ofeach of its sons, on the habit of
working with one's hands and thinking for
oneself, on complete self-fulfilment and
respect, as sacred as family honour, for
the complete self-fulfilment ofothers, and
on a passion for human dignity; other¬
wise the Republic is not worth a single
tear shed by our womenfolk or a single
drop of our brave men's blood."
These fruitful ideas appear in the doc¬
uments written by Marti that were, at the
end of the war, to inspire the creation of the
Cuban Republic, especially an article enti¬
tled "Our ideas", the Montecristi mani¬
festo and two letters to Federico Henriquez
Carvajal and Manuel A. Mercado. In these
and many other writings the Republic is
presented as an absolute democracy,
without privilege based on race or class,
founded on a fair distribution of wealth
and culture and on the demands of the
productive masses.
In a letter to his Mexican confidant,
written only a few hours before he was
killed in battle on 19 May 1895, Marti
wrote, ". . . from now on I am likely to die
any day for my country and my duty, a
duty which I know and am determined to
perform." Duty meant wresting Cuban
independence from Spain in order to pre¬
vent a new imperialism from spreading
through the West Indies and bringing
greater oppression to the Americas.
It was for this and not only to free Cuba
from Spanish dominion that José Martí
helped to organize the war in which he
would perish. But the parable ofMarti's life
continued to inspire future generations. As
he once said to Mercado, "I may fade away.
But my thinking will not."
Perhaps Marti's greatest quality was
his ability to speak to the poor and to chil¬
dren, his readiness to live and die for them.
His example will continue to inspire us.
The task he began is still unfinished both
in his homeland and elsewhere in the
world.

GREENWATCH
MONTSENY:
HARMONY IN
THE HILLS
BY FRANCE BEQUETTE
Ä Biosphere Reserve in the Catalonian
massif not far from Barcelona
Right, a typical
wooded valley in
the Montseny
Biosphere Reserve,
which extends over
more than 30,000
hectares.
M
ontseny National Park is
wrapped like a scarf round
a mountain massif. But the
scarf is not all cut from the same
cloth. To the south, it is perpetu¬
ally green, woven from evergreen
oaks, pines, arbutus, broom and
heather. To the north, the trees are
deciduous beech and chestnut. On
this winter Friday, only a few pine
trees and giant holly bushes add a
touch ofgreenery to the grey trunks.
The road is deserted, even though
the Barcelona conurbation with its
4.5 million inhabitants is only 50
km away. What is more, access to
Montseny is easy: a motorway, two
railway lines and buses. The public
throng here, especially on Satur¬
days and Sundays in the spring and
autumn. In summer, they prefer
the sea.
FREE ENTRY
However the visitor chooses to get
to the Park, there is no barrier at the
entrance. At weekends, three young
people in green uniforms occupy a
roadside cabin from which they
signal to cars to slow down and
hand the passengers a brochure
containing a plan of the Park and
information about how it functions.
The reader learns that farming and
¿m
IP ftc¡3l
timber are the main source of
income for most of the inhabitants
ofMontseny; that the land is in both
private and public ownership; that
forestry is governed by the law of
Catalonia and the rules laid down by
the park authorities; that hunting
is regulated; that the Park is an ideal
centre for all kinds of sports and
also provides an opportunity to
admire the natural and cultural her¬
itage; that everyone must help to
protect it for future generations;
and that camping is permitted only
at certain designated sites. There
follows a list of six prohibitions:
lighting fires, riding motorcycles off
the marked tracks, disposing of
refuse anywhere except in the many
dustbins provided for this purpose,
gathering mushrooms with a rake,
picking up chestnuts without per¬
mission from the owners of the
land, and cutting branches ofholly,
which is a protected plant.
From the 1,712-metre-high
summit of the Turo de l'Home, the
Mediterranean can be seen through
a gap in the coastal mountain range.
The Pyrenees lie to the north. A few
lighter points stand out in the forest
as it stretches down into the valley:
Romanesque churches built ofpink
sandstone, farms, inns, restaurants
and the buildings directly associ
ated with the Park's activities: the
house ofpopular culture, the school
of nature, a research station, infor¬
mation offices and interpreting cen¬
tres. Between the meteorological
observatory and the military post
with its two huge circular antennas,
a parapente school launches a few
foolhardy adepts out into the void.
Further down is a hang gliding base.
With all these colourful activities,
it is hard to imagine that you are in
a biosphere reserve-the very term
evokes a certain austerity (see box
page 41). Be that as it may, the Park
complies with Unesco standards.
Its eleven central zones, where tree
felling and hunting are prohibited,
are surrounded by a vast protected
area which itself forms part ofwhat
is known here as the "zone of influ¬
ence" or transition zone.
VISITORS AND LOCALS
Is it hard to ensure that the Park is
protected? Because of its proximity
to Barcelona, it was visited by
1,616,800 people in 1993. Since
there are no barriers, how was this
figure calculated? The answer is that
a vehicle counting system was
installed and it was estimated that
each car carried an average of three
passengers. The Park's director,

WORLD
TOURISM AND THE HERITAGE
A World Conference on Sustainable
Tourism, or ecotourism, will be held from
24 to 29 April 1 995 in Lanzarote, Canary
Islands (Spain). It is being organized jointly
by Unesco, the United Nations Environ¬
ment Programme (UNEP), the World
Tourism Organization and the Interna¬
tional Scientific Council for Island Devel¬
opment. After oil and cars tourism is the
world's third largest export industry.
Travel-related activities represent more
than 1 2% of world GNP and employ one
out of every sixteen working persons. But
tourism can have a destructive impact on
lands and cultures, and one of the ques¬
tions to be discussed at the Conference is
how the environment and the cultural
heritage can be reconciled with it. One fea¬
ture of the Conference will be a forum-
exhibition presenting a wide variety of
case-studies designed to encourage an
exchange of viewpoints and Ideas.

TORTURED TURTLES
Calypso Log, the magazine published by the
French environmental group Equipe
Cousteau, has come out strongly against
the way In which green turtles (Chelonia
mydas) are farmed on the French Island of
Réunion in the Indian Ocean. For breeding
requirements between 4,000 and 1 0,000
wild baby turtles are taken every year
from the Eparses Islands to the north of
Réunion. Only half of them survive. This
kind of operation is illegal. Green turtles
belong to an endangered species, and the
farm has no authorization to remove them
from their natural habitat, transport them
and market their shells. Furthermore, the
physical condition of the turtles is
deplorable. Diseased and poorly fed, they
cannibalize one another. A complaint
against France has been lodged with the
European Commission.
PARAGUAY PROTECTS ITS
BIODIVERSITY
Paraguay's congress has enacted a law
committing to conservation nearly 10%
of Its landmass, which in all Is about the size
of the American state of California. Thanks
to The Nature Conservancy, a U.S. non¬
governmental organization, a Conservation
Data Centre has been created in Paraguay

have helped to demonstrate the need to
protect the country's rich biodiversity.
Considerable responsibility for imple¬
menting the law will fall to the private
sector, and the Fundación Moisés ßertoni,
which has managed the Mbaracayu Forest

AN INTERNATIONAL BIOSPHERE
RESERVE CONFERENCE
An International Conference on Biosphere Reserves,
organized on UNESCO's initiative, will take place in Seville
(Spain) from 20-25 March 1 995. Its aim is to draw up a
new action plan for biosphere reserves on the basis of
an evaluation of results and experience acquired so far,
and in the light of the international context after the Rio
Conference. It is also expected to draft statutes for the
international network of biosphere reserves. Some 400
participants are expected to take part in the Conference,
notably biosphere reserve managers and co-ordinators,
scientists working on co-operative research programmes
in biosphere reserves, and decision-makers in the field
of conservation and natural resources management.

Eduard Botey Puig, an agricultural
engineer who also has a diploma in
geography, denies that the visitors
cause any problems. "The asphalted
roads are open to everyone. The
earth tracks are closed off by a
chain. Once they have parked their
cars in a parking area, visitors walk
around for a few minutes and then
return to their vehicles or go for
lunch. Bicycles on the other hand
can be ridden anywhere. But the
destructive invasion of mountain
bikes does not seem to have
reached this region yet."
What about the 850 permanent
inhabitants? How do they view the
tourists? "They benefit from them,"
Eduard says. "The restaurants are
full at the weekend and served
1,300,000 meals last year! We are
working with the local people to
develop pottery making and wood
carving and the sale of local prod¬
ucts such as pork sausages, cheese,
chestnuts, mushrooms, honey and
firewood. We also intend to orga¬
nize a Sunday market in the Park.
The old people stay in the village
with their grandchildren. They still
till the land and raise a few cattle,
but the wooded area is encroaching
on the fields. Young people go to
the city, but come back to look after
their woods. One family still works
a marble quarry that existed before
the Park was created. Life here is
not easy, but some people won't
accept change: they don't want elec¬
tricity or telephones and they don't
have cars. Park rangers on skis
deliver bread when the snow falls".
We come across a big white
cross-country vehicle sprouting
radio aerials. A girl in a brown uni¬
form sporting the insignia of the
forest rangers jumps down. Dolores
Rodriguez, aged twenty-five, is the
first and onlywoman to do this job.
She holds a diploma from a forestry
school and completed her one-year
training course before joining the
eleven other rangers in the reserve.
Twelve people to look after nearly
30,000 hectares! They have no
weapons and the only sanction they
can take is to note down the names
of persons who commit offences
and report them to the police. Edu¬
cation and prevention are the key
words. Apart from the rangers,
twenty-six other officials work in
the Park, plus another sixty who are
under contract to the local
authority. Exploring the north face
of the massif with Luis, a young
ranger who is a passionate nature-
lover, we come across a big pad¬
locked chain which bars off the
asphalted road. He sounds his horn
and an old man, his face wreathed
in smiles, runs up holding a wooden
box and a book of tickets: "240
pesetas," (around $2) he says.
THE LANDOWNERS ARE UNHAPPY
This toll charge, unusual in a bios¬
phere reserve, is highly revealing.
We learn from Ignasi Castello, head
of the Catalonian parks service, that
90 per cent of Montseny is in the
hands ofprivate owners! The prob¬
lems that Eduard did not mention
certainly exist. As far back as 1922,
attempts were made to protect
Montseny but they did not succeed
until 1977. In the following year, the
park became a biosphere reserve.
In 1994, round table meetings open
to the general public were held for a
month to review the status of the
Park and adapt it to the region's new
socio-economic situation.
Ignasi Castello does not deny
that the creation of the Park brought
land speculation to an end. Building
land is highly sought-after for

suburb" of Barcelona but, at the
stroke of a pen, the area ceased to be
building land and is now only worth
the price of agricultural or forest
land. But lawsuits are proliferating.
One example is that of a private
individual who bought a plot of land
crossed by a public footpath. He
wanted to close the path, but after
an enquiry the courts ruled in
favour of the Park. As Ignasi Castello
points out: "The aristocrats of the
mountain who ruled the roost in
the past find it hard to adjust to the
new situation. They are trying to set
up a pressure group within the Park
administration."
The Montsenybiosphere reserve
also has to fight on another front.
Hard-line environmentalists would
like to turn it into a sanctuary and
put it under wraps. Jacques Ducros,
of the Cévennes biosphere reserve
in France, which is twinned with
the Montseny reserve, said in 1988:
"What is the primary function of a
biosphere reserve? The harmonious
coexistence ofman and nature must
be our primary aim	 A biosphere
reserve must be created on inhab¬
ited lands where non-destructive
activities are pursued and where
the population is willing to accept,
for its own well-being, a few ele¬
mentary rules of management
which help to preserve the envi¬
ronment, to protect the existing her¬
itage, promote education and fur¬
ther knowledge."

CONSERVATION AND THE WISE USE
OF NATURE
A world convention on biological diversity was signed
at the Rio Conference on Environment and Develop¬
ment in 1992 and is now coming into force.
We know that we must protect animal and plant
species which may one day be needed and which form
part of the irreplaceable natural heritage of humanity.
But we also know that all over the world the ecosys¬
tems in which these species live are threatened by
urbanization, road-building, deforestation and other
developments. In tropical countries, which are the
richest in biological diversity but the poorest in eco¬
nomic terms, rural populations often have no choice but
to cut down trees for firewood and for the practice of
subsistence agriculture.
How can these vital human needs be reconciled
with the protection of nature? In the last twenty years
or so, Unesco has proposed a solution to the dilemma
in the form of what are known as "biosphere reserves".
These are land areas of varying size in which biological
diversity is protected in central zones, while local
populations have an opportunity to use the natural
resources in peripheral zones and thus guarantee that
the core areas are protected. This way of reconciling
environment and development on the ground is based
on wisely chosen forms of scientific research, man¬
agement and zoning and on international co-operation.
Today 324 biosphere reserves have been desig¬
nated in 82 countries as part of a worldwide network
run by Unesco's Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Pro¬
gramme. This is a very encouraging start. At the end of
March 1995, a major International Conference on
Biosphere Reserves will be held in Seville (Spain) in
order to strengthen this network and adopt an action
strategy in line with current developments in the con¬
servation of biological diversity and the management
and use of land in the interests of those who live on it,

new reserves per year in partnership with

tionalizes protected areas in Paraguay,
which were previously designated by pres¬
idential decree and faced the possibility of
being revoked with each new administra¬
tion. Now, as a spokesman for the Funda¬
ción says, "it is up to us to raise the money
and inspire local landowners to make this
national vision a reality."
RUSSIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL
CLEAN-UP
In November 1 994 the World Bank loaned
Russia $ 1 1 0 million for an Environmental
Management Project to upgrade the
country's environmental protection sys¬
tems and clean up pollution. The sum
comes on top of $84 million provided by
the Russian government, enterprises and
banks. The Project will help Russia to
reverse more than 70 years of neglect
during which harm to the environment
has been severe and widespread. Until
recently production was the only crite¬
rion of success for huge industrial com¬
plexes, gas, oil and mining operations. Envi¬
ronmental degradation is evident in cities,
rivers, lakes, forests and plant and animal
life. The task is immense.
LIMA ADOPTS A TWO-WHEELED
STRATEGY
Traffic in Lima (Peru) is causing growing
pollution, and many workers can barely
afford public transport. To solve the
problem a World Bank specialist has sug¬
gested promoting greater use of bicycles.
He argues that Lima is flat, without much
rain, and enjoys relatively mild tempera¬
tures for most of the year. Moreover, 63%
of the city's 6.5 million people are under 30
years old and thus can be considered
potential pushbike riders. One stumbling
block is that bicycles are relatively expen¬
sive. They currently cost at least $150
each, but it is possible that two Peruvian
companies may introduce less expensive
models that workers could buy with the
help of a new credit programme. The next
stage will be to build cycle paths, rehabil¬
itate roads and bridges, and persuade
people of the benefits of the bike.
BOUNTIFUL BREADFRUIT
Marie-Françoise Lamy, a teacher who lives
in Martinique, has written to tell us about I
the amazing properties of the breadfruit
tree (Artocarpus alias). Breadfruit can be
turned into cakes, syrup, jam, chewing gum,
vinegar, yeast, starch, soap and even sheets
of paper. Waste can go for animal food or
can, as a last resort, be used as compost.
The breadfruit tree grows in tropical areas.

WELCOME TO THE SIERRA CLUB!
The Sierra Club, which currently
has almost 600,000 members, was
founded by John Muir and his
artist and mountaineering friends in
1892 to protect the forests and wilder¬
nesses of the United States. Now, for
more than a century, volunteers have
kept a vigilant eye on more than 60
million hectares of land. The Club's
extremely active members constitute
a pressure group that works to influ¬
ence how legislators vote on environ¬
mental issues, and when a law is
enacted they are ready to go to court to
make sure it is enforced. Over the years
the Club's objectives have broadened
to include planetary issues such as the
ozone layer, acid rain, the greenhouse
effect and rainforest protection.
In the early days, before the envi¬
ronment became a widespread pre¬
occupation, Sierra Club outings looked
more like scout camps than scientific
expeditions. Members would gather
round campfires, sing songs and recite
poetry with the spectacular scenery
of California's Yosemite Park as their
back-drop. By 1949 the numbers of
visitors had risen so high that two Club
members wrote anxiously of the
national parks as "a sort ofsynthesis of
the public library, the art gallery and
the museum, out of doors and full of
native inspiration	 But the public
library ceases to function at some point
if overcrowded. ... So, too, does the
national park."
One of the Sierra Club's most spec
tacular operations took place in 1966
when it used full-page newspaper ads
as part of a campaign against the
building of two dams on the Colorado
River where it passed through the
Grand Canyon. The project was even¬
tually dropped. The following year the
Club protested against a scheme to
build a nuclear power plant near the
rare ecosystem of the Nipomo Santa
Maria dunes on the California coast. A
deal was finally struckwith the power
company, which agreed to build its
facility a little further away. Next, the
Club turned its sights on Alaska, which
had been admitted to the Union as a
state in 1959 and was a fabulous trea¬
sure trove of countryside, resources,
plant and animal life. After a nine-year
lobbying campaign, it was eventually
granted legal protection. This was the
biggest campaign in the history of a
Club which is never short ofcauses to
defend. It would, for example, like to
ban the sale abroad ofpesticides that
are outlawed in the United States, and
notes in surprise that only 2% of the
400 pesticides that the American Con¬
gress requested the Environmental
Protection Agency to re-examine in
1972 have actually been studied and
then only for their carcinogenic prop¬
erties without considering their effects
on the nervous, immune, or repro¬
ductive systems.
A recent Sierra Club campaign was
combined with a voyage to a remote
and beautiful region when, in Feb
ruary 1994, a handsome three-masted
schooner sailed along the coast of
British Columbia in western Canada
with a crew of scientists and journal¬
ists. Their aim was to focus global
attention on the region's spectacular
temperate rainforests and to record in
words and images what may well be
lost to chainsaws in the next few years.
At the end of the voyage they trum¬
peted their indignation at the massive
deforestation that logging companies
had carried out on the quiet, far from
prying eyes. In a recent issue of the
Club's handsome bi-monthly maga¬
zine, Sierra, a botanist described how
a trek along the California coast by a
small group of conservationists
revealed the presence of so many
plants foreign to the area that indige¬
nous species were in danger of being
forced out altogether. The botanist did,
however, ask the pertinent question
ofhow many centuries it takes before
a species can be considered indige¬
nous to a region.

Club's spectacular back-packing treks in

Population growth
and development
interview with Jean-Claude Chasteland
*»-*
Poverty, unemployment, social disintegration and other items on the agenda of this month's
Social Summit cannot be fully understood without reference to demography. Here Jean-Claude
Chasteland, a former director of the United Nations Population Division and currently scientific
advisor to the French National Institute for Demographic Studies in Paris, outlines his thinking
on demographic problems today.
The international community has been
concerned about population questions
since the 1950s. At that time world pop¬
ulation was two billion; today, it is 5.7
billion. How should we be reacting to this
situation?
The world population situation has
changed radically in the past forty years
and especially in the past twenty. Ofthe 5.7
billion people living on the planet, about
one billion live in the so-called developed
countries, where fertility is low. But people
should realize that only some 700 billion of
the other 4.7 billion live in countries where
fertility has not yet begun to fall. In most
Third World countries, fertility has defi¬
nitely declined. That was not the case in
1974. Today, the problems ofvery high fer¬
tility are centred geographically on sub¬
sanaran Africa, some regions of south¬
west Asia and one or two countries of
Central America.
In the other areas with a high popula¬
tion density, such as North Africa notably
Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and above
all China, fertility has fallen very rapidly.
The case of China is particularly extraor¬
dinary. A developing country with 1.2 bil¬
lion inhabitants, representing one-quarter
of the population of the Third World and
one-fifth of total world population, has
managed to bring its birth rate down below
replacement level within a single genera¬
tion. Europe took more than a century to
reach that stage. This unprecedented
decline is an encouraging sign, especially
since other equally spectacular downturns
have been observed in a different polit¬
ical context, in the Republic of Korea and
in Thailand.
However, despite the fall in fertility,
the number of births is still rising in the
Third World and will continue to do so.
There are fewer births per couple but a
very large number ofcouples have already
reached the age of procreation. It is only
when their children in turn reach that age
that the number of births will fall in
absolute terms. There is a gap between
the time when fertility falls and that when
the number of births itself begins to
decline in absolute terms. Because ofthat
gap, population growth will peak early
next century and will only begin to fall
later on.
For the time being, rapid population
growth is continuing and all these people
must be properly provided with food, edu¬
cation and health care, and have access to
work and shelter. That calls for consider-

able investment and poses problems in
terms of development.
Development has been described as the
most effective contraceptive. The specific
link between population and development
was to be examined at the Cairo Confer¬
ence in September 1994 and is also on the
agenda of the Social Development Summit.
The Cairo Conference was supposed to
be dedicated to the problems of popula¬
tion and development, but the develop¬
ment issue was to some extent sidelined.
The emphasis was placed on reproduc¬
tion and on the condition of women, all
this being seen in an individualist per¬
spective which disturbed a number ofpar¬
ticipating countries. Some twenty of these
countries expressed reservations about
the content of some paragraphs of the
action plan, whereas a paragraph in the
introduction stipulates that the recom¬
mendations are acceptable only to the
extent that they are not incompatible with
religious beliefs. This is a retrograde step in
comparison with the previous population
conferences held in Bucharest (1974) and
Mexico City (1984).
How do you explain this disagreement?
It must be accepted that the action plan
was inspired by a Northern approach. The
model of the condition ofwomen is based
on that ofwomen in Sweden rather than in
Saudi Arabia. Similarly, the countries of "W

the North tried to win acceptance for their
very open concepts of the family. Of course
this gave rise to keen controversy, under¬
lining the dichotomy between a religious
vision of the world and what I would term
a more modernist approach without reli¬
gious overtones.
Regardless of their theme, the big
United Nations conferences always reflect
the international atmosphere prevailing at
the time when they are held. The Cairo
Conference was the first population con¬
ference to be held since the collapse of
the Communist bloc. Previously, these
conferences were generally the setting for
East-West ideological confrontations in
which the South played whatever role it
could. With the disappearance of the "left
hemisphere" of international life, con¬
frontations have shifted onto religious
ground, with on one side the Vatican and
certain Islamic countries and on the other
industrialized nations which subscribe to
radically different concepts of the family,
the condition of women, abortion and
sexual life in general.
This being so, is it going to be possible to

strategies, as desired by the United
Nations?
It was probably the emphasis laid on
individual problems, leaving aside devel¬
opment issues, that weakened the
expected consensus on the programme
of the Cairo Conference. There are other
development problems as well as that of
the condition of women. I fail to see how
women's condition could be improved
independently of other development fac¬
tors such as water supplies, electrification
and employment. A woman is not really
free if she has to walk several miles every
day to fetch water, just as a family cannot
flourish in an environment ofpoverty.
Everybody agrees on the need for
development, regardless of their religious

or ideological convictions. Let us not be
pessimistic. Extraordinary progress has
been made in the last forty years, in the
Third World as elsewhere. Mortality in the
Third World has declined substantially,
because of education as well as vaccina¬
tion campaigns. In the 1950s the level of
illiteracy was very high as much as 90
per cent in the case ofwomen. Today, even
ifprogress has been uneven, we are dealing
with illiteracy rates of between 20 and 30
per cent.
On the whole, the 5.7 billion people
alive today lead far better lives than the 2
billion who lived in the 1950s. The proof is
that their life expectancy has risen. We
have made enormous progress. Now we
must maintain the pace of advance and
also adopt a cautious attitude towards
population growth and its potential
impact on the environment. We must also
avoid polarizing attention on some
aspects of the problem, such as pollution
or depletion of natural resources, for
which the critical thresholds are con¬
stantly being pushed back either by new
discoveries or by the appearance of sub¬
stitution products.

Text selected by Edgardo Canton
In the course of its transformation
into an industrial enterprise, a com¬
pany of shareholders, the modern
newspaper has naturally been compelled
to give priority to dividends over all other
interests. To maintain the popularity of
his paper and its daily sales, the editor of
a widely read organ is obliged to cultivate
the sensational taste of his readers.
The fascination of crime
The realms of science, morals and philos¬
ophy are, by their very nature, almost inca¬
pable of producing facts or phenomena
calculated to appeal to that lust for sensa¬
tion which is a public failing in all lati¬
tudes. From time to time, a discovery such
as the application of the theory ofHertzian
waves to wireless telegraphy or the first
aeroplane flights provide matter that
appeals to the masses; but the need to
keep the reading public in a perpetual
state of tension in order to maintain or
increase sales forces newspaper propri
etors to seek the sensational item in other
aspects of human activity.
In this branch of information, crime
provides usable material every day. There
is no need to recall that criminal news
items exercise a veritable fascination on all
classes of readers. It seems that the record
of crime in all its odious fecundity would
suffice to slake the daily curiosity of the
public. But the papers are often compelled
to resort to an inordinate amplification of
detail in order to arouse more interest;
and there are undertakings which do not
hesitate to invent a crime if the annals of
criminality do not furnish one.
Bread and circuses
Sport and the social column provide the
modern newspaper with another kind of
publicity which is easily explained. From
the point of view of publicity, these sub¬
jects differ from that of crime, insofar as
the illustrious actors on these stages of
modern life seek an advertisment which
others endeavour to elude.
The press has greatly contributed to
the propagation of sport, and it accepts
complacently the plaudits which the
public unjusdy lays at its door for the wel¬
come effects of such activity upon the
sociability and the health of the human
race; but the truth is that such influence is
reciprocal, and that the press would lose a
great number of its readers if it devoted to
other forms ofcontemporary life the space
which is taken by tennis, football, pelota,
golf and portraits of champions.
Sport is developing because those

interested in its practice know that by this
means they achieve the honours of pub¬
licity, and the press occasionally gives inor¬
dinate space to its sporting chronicle in
order to recruit an assiduous reading
public of professionals and amateurs
whose number increases thanks to the
encouragement of publicity.
In the course of its natural interests,
the press tends to attach to certain activ¬
ities more importance than they deserve.
News concerning literary and artistic
trends, the theatre and other manifesta¬
tions of taste and intelligence occupy less
and less space, unless they have a sensa¬
tional flavour. The literary chronicle,
which, half a century ago, was the main
attraction of the better papers in France,
England, Italy and learned Germany, has
been abandoned to monthly or weekly
publications specializing in this type of
study.
If perchance the great daily press pub¬
lishes literary news of some length and
real interest, the public smiles disdain¬
fully, for it regards such news as publicity
at so much a line, inserted by publishers.
Cut-throat competition
In all aspects of journalistic activity, the
absorbing and to a certain point deplorable
influence of commercial interests can be
discerned at a glance. It would be unfair,
and, above all, vain to demand that the
press should renounce commercial activity
because it was originally an educational
medium; what the writer of these lines
would desire is the reconciliation of two
apparently contradictory tendencies.
To this must be added that the great
commercialized press as it exists today
has been suddenly confronted with a
menace, in the form ofcompetitors whose
means of dissemination for certain
branches of trade are superior to its own.
The wireless, which derives its nourish¬
ment from the daily press, is tending to
supersede it in certain activities. This
mode ofdissemination, intelligently com
bined with the cinematograph, could
easily become the most effective of edu¬
cational mediums; but, fortunately for
the newspapers, both wireless and cine¬
matograph have up to the present been
commercial experiments whose devel¬
opment is governed by exactly the same
principles as that of the powerful rival
which they are seeking by merciless com¬
petition to supplant.
To sum up, it is necessary to put quite
frankly a very serious question: Can it be
said that there is not only a danger, but
also the possibility that the press, byvirtue
of its unlimited power, may voluntarily
exert its influence in the service of ten¬
dencies contrary to the progress of civi¬
lization, provided the exploitation ofsuch
tendencies results in a pecuniary gain for
the newspapers thus proceeding?
The disclosures made on this point
during the past few years, according to
which certain newspapers have not hesi¬
tated to make a dangerous appeal to
national feeling in order to realise mas¬
sive profits, unfortunately warrant the
conclusion that, in more critical circum¬
stances, they would not hesitate to dis¬
turb the peace, if, by so doing, they
achieved a durable and profitable increase
of influence and revenue.
Having stated the above considera¬
tions, I must ask the following question,
"Does the information, habitually fur¬
nished by press to public, tend in general,
by its nature, to develop the education
and the general knowledge of the latter?"
From the foregoing, it is clear that this
question must be answered in the nega¬
tive. The education received by the public
from large-circulation newspapers is of a
bad quality. Special literary preparation
and a very lively sense of reality are nec¬
essary in order to combat the evil influence
of the daily press and to derive from it
useful knowledge. So long as big newspa¬
pers are guided by the principles that make
for commercial success, it is impossible
for them to become a factor in education.
What is newsworthy?
When the reader has devoured the sen¬
sational paragraphs devoted to crime,
championships, war, earthquakes, railway
and other accidents, he has just time to
read the Stock Exchange prices and per¬
haps an esoteric political leader. His mind
is too weary to read articles on the new
atomic theory or to assimilate the latest
discoveries about the stratosphere.
Information about foreign nations and
culture is provided by newspapers in
accordance with local requirements. In
Buenos Aires, where there are a million
foreign residents, a majority ofwhom have
retained a business or sentimental con¬
nection with their home country, infor¬
mation about foreign events occupies as
much, if not more, space than the local
news. This predominance offoreign infor¬
mation has widened the outlook of the
reading public of this city by the influence
it exercises on national feeling.
As a matter of fact, up to recent years,
the Buenosairean followed international
questions with great equanimity, toler¬
ance and detailed knowledge. The quan¬
tity of foreign information in the press of
this capital had produced this result on
popular education.
But it must be admitted that the abun¬
dance of foreign news daily offered the
public by the Buenosairean press was in all
probability not so much the result of an
educational endeavour as a calculation
based on the need to increase the sales of
the papers. At all events, this instance
shows that abundant information is of
indisputable educational value, ifnews is
published without interpretations foreign
to its real significance and historical value.
To sum up, if a newspaper is to become
a conveyor of useful notions, an instru¬
ment of civilization, if it is to serve the real
cause ofmankind, it must begin by casting
off its character of a commercial under¬
taking, a role too dependent upon con¬
tingencies in a world exclusively governed
by the law of competency.

UNITED NATIONS YEAR FOR TOLERANCE
Federico Mayor
Director-General of Unesco
Violence, an affront to humanity
The Cold War long justified the intolerable. So long as the world was
divided into two camps, hostilities, violence and massacres were con¬
cealed or sanctioned. Today, we know. In a more transparent world, we no
longer have the excuse of innocence.
Today there are no longer any camps and the world is one. But along¬
side the joy and hope occasioned by the progress of freedom, democracy
and peace, unhappiness continues to advance through the violence of
ethnic cleansing, terrorism, cultural and religious extremism, genocide,
exclusion and discrimination.
Violence, especially when it imperils life, is inexcusable. How can it
be justified by "religious" arguments when all religions are founded on
love and generosity? Violence can and must be combated as such, as an
affront to everything that makes for humanity in a human being and as
the expression of an inability to move from dreams of hegemony to the
reality of interdependence.
From now on, the archaic culture of war must yield to the culture of
peace in which the cult of force and the apology of competition will be
replaced by the emergence of new horizons of human solidarity, the daily
epic of freedom and justice, the sense of fellowship embracing, at once,
human beings everywhere and generations to come.
From now on, humanity must be able to devote itself to the safe¬
guarding, restoration and construction of peace, through the creation of
the necessary areas of dialogue, co-operation and reconciliation. Yes to
disagreement, no to violence. What is required by democratic princi¬
ples which must be consolidated every dayis neither docility nor sub¬
mission. On the contrary, it is involvement in discussion, it is the expres¬
sion of the ideals and ideas of all, with verve and perseverance. But this is
not, ever, violence.
If we wish to remedy the asymmetry of our world, reduce inequali¬
ties in the distribution of its resources, we must not slacken in the fight
against ignorance, poverty and humiliation. We must strengthen our
efforts and pursue them unremittingly in order to counter hostile inter¬
ests and correct shortsightedness, which is always a bad counsellor. But
violence never again.
From now on, let us decree that citizens should no longer sacrifice
their lives but rather live them; that the finest tribute one can pay to the
dead ofall the wars of this century is to preserve the lives of their children.
From now on, in the conscience and behaviour of each of us, tolerance
should assume its strongest significance: not simply the acceptance of
others with their differences, but a spontaneous movement towards
others, to know them better and to know ourselves better through them,
to share with them, to extend to them the hand of fellowship and compas¬
sion, so that universal values, common to all, are enriched by the precious
individuality of every culture and every language, and by the irreplaceable
creativity of every person.

OPERA FROM TAIWAN
by Isabelle Leymarie
48
I Beijing Opera, widely regarded as the
I paragon of Chinese opera, is severely
stylized. Its Taiwanese cousin (ke tsai hsi),
less well known abroad until recently, is more
flexible and has shown a remarkable capacity
to adapt to the contemporary world.
The ancestry of Taiwanese opera can be
traced back to ke tsai chen, a form of street the¬
atre that developed from folk songs and folk
tale's introduced into Taiwan by immigrants who
arrived there in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries from Fujian province in southeast
China. In the 1920s, it returned to Fujian, then
spread to Singapore and developed fully in
Taiwan after the Second World War. It has never
lost its spontaneity or its roots in folk art.
The Ming Hwa Yuan company, founded in
1929, is a distinguished exponent of ke tsai hsi.
One of the main works in its repertoire is
Buddha Incarnate, the plot of which is based on
the conflict between the fatalistic Taoist master
Ch'un Yang, who believes that there is a fun¬
damental difference between human beings
and non-human beings, and the Buddhist monk
Ji Gong, who professes unconditional love for all
living creatures. These are two of several arche¬
typal characters from Chinese literature and
folklore who appear in the opera. Ji Gong is
thought to have been a wild, drunken monk
who lived in the thirteenth century in Zhejiang
province and, in spite of his unkempt appear¬
ance and contempt for conventions, achieved
illumination long before his more respectable
correligionists. Another stock figure is the Taoist
master who is able to perform supernatural
feats but is power-hungry and amuses himself
by baiting the Buddhist hero. Other characters
in the opera include a cunning white fox, who is
also a figure of Japanese mythology, and a
peach-tree, a sturdy figure whose symbolism is
obscure.
MEN PLAYED BY WOMEN
Bored by the hereafter, the white fox and his
acolyte the peach tree decide to assume human
form and come down to earth to see what is
going on in the living world. The fox is victorious
in a martial arts competition organized by a man
who is on the look-out for a suitor for his
daughter, and duly wins the young woman's
heart. His love is returned, but he is unmasked
by the Taoist Master, who tries to prevent the
union. Now aware that the fox is a superhuman
being, the young woman's family opposes the
wedding. To prove his sincerity, the fox gives up
his natural form and the magic powers that go
A colourful form of
entertainment inspired by
music hall, cinema and
folk theatre
with it, and turns into a simple mortal. After
many adventures and with the help of Ji Gong,
who fights with the Taoist Master in the pres¬
ence of the rulers of hell, the fox becomes a
scholar, brilliantly passes his state exams,
weds his beloved and wins the affection of her
parents.
In Chinese theatre, the feminine nature of
certain characters is heightened by the fact
thateven in rural Chinawomen play male
roles (in Japanese kabuki drama the reverse is
the case). In Buddha Incarnate the fox and the
peach tree are both played by young women. "Tai¬
wanese theatre is very gentle," explains Ming
Hwa Yuan's director. "We don't like violent things.
Women have gradually come to play male roles
because with a woman it is more beautiful."
A METAPHOR FOR
THE BUDDHIST WAY
Although archetypal characters appear in Tai¬
wanese opera, the legends on which it is based
are sometimes modified or invented. In Buddha
Incarnate, for example, Ji Gong is moved by the
sincerity of the fox's love for the young woman
and uses all kinds of stratagems and martial
arts skills to help bring about their marriage
an episode which does not appear in the orig¬
inal version of the drunken monk's biography.
After suspense worthy of a Kung Fu movie,
Buddha Incarnate comes to a happy end. The
moral undertones of such operasin this case
the themes of redemption and the deceptive-
ness of appearancesare very important. In
order to get what he wants, the fox triumphs
over dark forces. As his inner revolution pro¬
gresses from the opening of his heart to the
renunciation of false friendships, the fox
becomes a metaphor for the Buddhist way.
Once a family affair, the Ming Hwa Yuan
company today recruits actors among teenagers
who have completed their secondary studies.
In the past, Chinese peasant families found
their children a place in theatre companies to
provide them with a future. Chen Kaige's film
Farewell, My Concubine shows that their training
could be hard and often cruel. In Taiwan today,
however, young people are only too happy to
embark on a career in show business. The
aspiring performers follow their apprentice¬
ship, which lasts about two years, by watching
their seniors and playing small parts. "We like
young people," says the director. "They have
lots of enthusiasm and energy."
Plenty of physical energy is certainly needed
for the long dally grind of rehearsal, and early
to bed and early to rise is the rule when the com¬
pany is on the road. The performers rehearse
on stage for hours, learning not only their lines
but collective choreography, acrobatics and
martial arts, especially the arm gestures taken
from the chen form of Tai chi, the ancient Chi¬
nese art of body movement. Everything is made
more attractive by emphasizing the surreal and
the fantastic in order to enchant the audience.
Without their extraordinary make-up the actors
look much more vulnerable than they do during
the show. Many of them are still children or
rebellious teenagers, sometimes tired, preoc¬
cupied or unruly.
A DAZZLING SPECTACLE
Taiwan opera is a dazzling spectacle with its
blend of sets, lights and traditional and kitsch
costumes taken from music hall, movies and
other kinds of theatre. All kinds of odds and
ends are tacked on to the main plot. "It is a free
form," says the director. "In this way the show
becomes a mirror of present-day life. The audi¬
ence feels that what is happening on stage is
close to their lives, and this has an effect on
them. We have to rehearse constantly because
even a well prepared show never follows a set
course. It is subject to constant variations."
The lively, rhythmic music also plays an
important role. Played on traditional Chinese
string and percussion instruments, it is based
on peasant songs arranged by the company's
own composer who, depending on require¬
ments, adds snatches of already existing music
or composes original passages. It may be used
deliberately to go against the flow of the action,
relax a tense situation or create a comic atmos¬
phere and special effects. At various moments
during the performance the players start to
dance disco style, keeping a two-four beat as in
black music, a scansion unknown in the Asian
tradition.

ETTERS TO THE EDITOR
SLAVERY IN HISTORY
I am writing to express my indignation as
an African about certain articles published
in your October 1994 issue Slavery, a crime
without punishment.
The so-called triangular slave trade
(ships plying from European ports to West
Africa, then the West Indies and back to
Europe again) and the black slave trade
were not the only manifestations of slavery,
although in time and space they consti¬
tuted its bloodiest and hence most massive
and inhuman form. The cover illustration,
whatever its historical accuracy, is too
selective and is yet another affront to black
dignity and may encourage anti-African
racism.
First of all, I would remind you that
the word "slave" is not African. It comes
from "Slav", a name still borne by the peo¬
ples of central Europe, a region which in
the Middle Ages supplied slaves to the
Ottoman Empire, the East, the Middle
East, and even western Europe. Where
does this put pharaonic Egypt, ancient
Greece and imperial Rome?
I was particularly shocked by the inter¬
view with Mr. Doudou Diene ("The Slave
Route", p. 29) which I regard as the expres¬
sion of a dead African memory. "The initial
act of the black slave trade," says Mr. Diène,
"barbaric as it was, came to be instru-

mental in laying the foundations ofa new
civilization." What intellectual processes
lead him to see the enslavement of our
ancestors, which I consider to be the
biggest act of genocide in history, as an
act "laying the foundations of a new civi¬
lization"? . . .
When a production system reduces
200 million human beings to the state of
chattels for three centuries (from the 16th
to the 19th centuries), what justification
can there be for talking about "civiliza¬
tion"? Some, like the late Cheikh Anta Diop,
preferred the term "barbarity". . . .
I note the same contempt for the
memory of Africa and our deported
brothers in the article by the historian
Elikia M'Bokolo ("Who was responsible?",
p. 1 1) . To ask who was responsible for the
black slave trade is no more nor less than
sophistry. . . .
The slave trade originated in violence.
Might prevailed over right and ruled out
any notion of choice. In the ensuing cen¬
turies the same balance of power con¬
tinued to operate against the black man,
who was no match for Western slavers.
Among many statements that seem to
me to be unwarranted let me draw your
attention to this one: "The social history of
pre-colonial Africa shows that slavery was
a widespread institution in [some] states"
(p. 12). This is either a lie or pure igno¬
rance.
Slavery was unknown to the African
peoples before the onslaught of the slave-
traders. This was the case, for example, of
the Bwo and Minianka of Mali and the
Fang of Equatorial Africa. What is more,
the writings of the first Arab travellers to
Africa, in the 8th and 9th centuries, show
that there was no institutional slavery in,
for example, Ghana and Mali.
Some features of the Cisse (Ghana)
and Keita (Mali) empires were not unlike
those found in the feudal societies of
western Europe. In the Mali empires
(Ghana, Mande, Songhai, Macina, Segu)
there was a kind ofvassalage that was ini¬
tially based on a relationship of military
dependence and protection.
The only form of pre-colonial slavery
was ofEuropean origin. The African states
were forced to superimpose on the system
of feudal serfdom, traces of which still
exist in Mauritania and northern Mali, a
new system from outside that was alien to
previous practices.
I feel it is a serious matter to confuse the
"merchandizing" ofAfricans by Europeans
with the feudal practices (prisoners ofwar
and serfs often eventually became part of
the families they served or recovered their
freedom) that were features of our states
before contact with the Portuguese and,
later, with other Westerners	
Thus in ancient Kongo, a so-called
"slave" was called "navana", the child. He did
not become a commodity until the coming
of the European slave trade. Here, as in the
Sahelian social groups described by Mr.
M'Bokolo, a slave should the term even be
used? was part of the lineage and could
even wed the master's daughter. He pos¬
sessed rights. He was not, as described in
the "Black Code" ofLouis XIV (p. 19), "mov¬
able" or "immovable" property.
So let's have no more intellectual spec¬
ulation about our millions of deported
and dead. May they rest at last in peace
and dignity.
Tinge Coulibaly

THE THIRD ROOT
The historical arguments used in Mr. Tinge
Coulibaly's letter justify the urgent need,
which Unesco wishes to meet, for a new
look at the black slave trade.
In his letter the debate hinges on two
points:
a) The specificity of the black slave
trade. Although slavery may be a wide¬
spread phenomenon, it is generally agreed,
as historianJean-Michel Deveau acknowl¬
edges in the introduction to his recent work,
La France au temps des négriers (France-
Empire, Paris, 1994), that the black slave
trade "by virtue ofits magnitude and dura¬
tion constituted the greatest tragedy in
human history".
The extreme complexity ofstudying this
major historical phenomenon and its con¬
sequences has led the Director-General of
Unesco to set up a multidisciplinary Inter¬
national Scientific Committee with some
thirty members. At the end ofitsfirst session,
held in Ouidah (Benin), the Committee
recommended to the Director-General that
in theframework ofits Slave Route project
Unesco should give priority to the trian¬
gular black slave trade, without, however,
ignoring the trans-Saharan and Indian
Ocean slave routes.
b) The consequences ofthe black slave
trade. It should be remembered that the m q
black slave trade was a brutal, enforced H«#

encounter between millions ofAfricans
and theAmerindian and European popu¬
lations oftheAmericas and the West Indies.
It was also a cultural encounter insofar as
it is through culture that African slaves
were able to survive and face the terrible
conditions that wereforced on them.
This is why one ofthefiercest struggles
of the descendants ofAfrican slaves has
been to achieve recognition oftheir identity
and ofthefertilization ofAmerindian and
European cultures byAfrican culture. It is
in this context that the black slave trade
may be said to have contributed to the
foundation ofcivilizations.
In addition to their activities in the
United States, which are well known, com¬
munities ofAfrican origin in several Latin
American countries are voicing intellec¬
tual and political demandsfor recognition
ofa cultural pluralism to which they have
made a large contribution. It is significant
in this regard that intellectuals and
researchers ofnon-African origin are also
waging the same struggle. A case in point is
Mexico's Third Root programme, which
seeks to promote recognition oftheAfrican
as well as the Amerindian and European
root of the civilizations oftheAmericas.

THE SLAVE TRADE
AND TWENTIETH-CENTURY
NEOCOLONIALISM
Mr. Tinge Coulibaly's letter has the merit of
recalling two importantpoints. Firstly, that
debate and controversy are partand parcel
ofhistoriography. Secondly, that assump¬
tion of the collective memory is always
accompanied by disagreement. All the
same, unless one believes that one has a
monopoly ofthe truth, one cannot simply
dismiss those who differ from one's own
point ofview as liars or ignoramuses.
1) Slavery in Africa. Discussion is no
longer in order about the existence of
slavery in Africa because of the number
and diversity, not only of the contempo¬
rary sources we possess on the subject, but
also ofearlier and later sources bothfrom
outside Africa (Arab and European trav¬
ellers of very different backgrounds and
status) andfrom within the continent (the
writings of African scholars and oral
sources) all ofwhich confirm the existence
ofaform ofAfrican slavery.
What may legitimately be discussed is
the use ofconcepts such as slave, serf, pris¬
oner ordependant on theonehand, andon
the other, the unequal distribution of this
slavery over the continent in different types
ofsociety (whence the useful distinction
between "state" and "society without a
state") and in different regions. What may
abo be discussed are the chronologyand the
nature of the interactions between "the
slave trade" and interior slavery.
My position is based not only on the
sources but on an obvious fact and a
hypothesis: slavery was practised in ancient
times fryall known states in all the cultural
areas ofhumanity. So, unless one believes
that Africans do not form part of this
common humanity, it is legitimate to put
forward the hypothesis (confirmed by the
sources) that their states also practised a
form ofslavery that was specific to their
particular social organization and inde¬
pendent of the European and Arab slave
trades.
2) The transitionfrom the period when
slaves were abducted to the age ofthe slave
trade. This phenomenon has been generally
established and solidly documented in
studies on the Sahelian states, Senegambia,
"Upper Guinea", the GulfofGuinea, Kongo
and Angola and the hinterland ofZanz¬
ibar. Slave trading was clearly based on
constant violence, but it should not be
restricted to a European/African,
white/black polarization.
After the abduction phase, the dura¬
tion of which varied from place to place
and sometimes depended on commercial
practices, came a time when African states
specialized, whether we like it or not, in
capturing slaves using firearms sold by
Europeans. Iwill put it differently by using
an anachronistic metaphor: the slave trade
functioned like 20th-century neo-colo-
nialism: the profits went to the states and
companies ofEurope and the Americas,
while the on-the-ground task ofproducing
goods for export at any cost (war in the
past, autocracy today) was left to the
Africans.
A mass ofdocumentation exists on all
these questions. I have made an honest
effort to identify the points of agreement
and divergence. Whatever Mr. Coulibaly
may think, the real differences between his¬
torians concern harder questions than those
Idiscussed in myarticle, e.g. quantifying the
slave trade and its effects on the economic,
political and psychologicalfuture ofAfrica.
