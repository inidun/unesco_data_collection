The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR) is undoubtedly one of the 
greatest documents in history. The first 
international treaty of ethical values to be 
adopted by humanity as a whole, it has 
served for seventy years “as a common 
standard of achievement for all peoples 
of all nations,” to quote from the speech 
of Eleanor Roosevelt – Chairperson of the 
Commission on Human Rights and of the 
UDHR Drafting Committee – delivered 
at the United Nations General Assembly 
on 9 December 1948, the day before the 
Declaration was adopted.
Hailed as a unique charter of humanity 
and accepted as a key reference in today’s 
world when it comes to upholding the 
human dignity of people everywhere, 
the Declaration has not been immune to 
criticism, notably invoking the argument 
for cultural diversity.
While it is true that in its form, the 
UDHR is largely inspired by the Western 
tradition, it is equally true that, in 
substance, its principles are universal. 
“Tolerance and respect for individual 
dignity are foreign to no people and 
native to all nations,” stated Kofi Annan, 
the former Secretary-General of the 
United Nations (1997-2006), at the 
commemoration of the 50th anniversary 
of the Declaration at UNESCO in 1998. 
We pay tribute to the Ghanaian diplomat, 
who passed away on 18 August 2018.
For his part, Federico Mayor, Director-
General of UNESCO at the time, declared 
that “In ‘commemoration’, there is ‘memory’. 
We cannot act without memory. But what 
we must remember in order for our actions 
to be worthy of our fathers is not so much 
the date, the place or the letter, but more 
the sounds, the colours, the feeling or the 
spirit of the moment.”
This is precisely the goal of this issue of 
the Courier: to rediscover the spirit of the 
time, so that we may better inform our 
reflections on human rights today. The 
Wide Angle section presents a selection of 
texts sent in response to a major survey on 
the philosophical foundations of human 
rights, launched in 1947 by Julian Huxley, 
the first Director-General of UNESCO.  
More than sixty prominent thinkers 
responded to the call of the young 
Organization. Mahatma Gandhi was one 
of them, as were Benedetto Croce, Aldous 
Huxley, Humayun Kabir, Lo Chung-Shu 
and Arnold Schoenberg.
“Such a project was particularly 
timely, for a world consciousness had 
developed towards this question. 
Our whole social structure had been 
shaken by the repercussions of total 
war. People everywhere sought a 
common denominator to the problem 
of fundamental Human Rights,” wrote 
Jacques Havet – who coordinated the 
project – in the August 1948 Courier. 
The answers – some very brief letters, 
others long studies of the question 
– reflected, according to the young 
French philosopher, “nearly all the 
world’s national groups and nearly all 
ideological approaches”.
Certainly, the world has changed a lot 
in the last seventy years. Many nations 
have cast off the colonial yoke, and many 
cultural traditions have resurfaced since 
the adoption of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights on 10 December 1948. 
Yet this effort by UNESCO – to develop 
a global philosophy based on a broad 
knowledge of the world’s cultures – has 
lost none of its relevance or validity.
In 1949, UNESCO compiled many of 
the responses to the survey under 
the title Human rights: comments and 
interpretations, to “help the creation of a 
better understanding between men of 
different cultures”, as Havet put it. 
Today, the UNESCO Courier subscribes to 
the same logic. Because of limited space, 
we can only reprint a few of the hundreds 
of pages received by UNESCO in 1947. More 
texts are available in the Courier online. We 
are aware our selection cannot do justice to 
the full scope of the project, but we hope it 
will provide some food for thought.
The days of 
closed systems of 
divergent civilizations 
and, therefore, 
of divergent 
conceptions of 
human rights are 
gone for good

This issue is accompanied by a 
supplement containing about fifty

publish an interview with him (p. 54). 
The Peruvian artist was inspired by 
the pages of the Courier (from 1948 to 
1954) for his series of drawings titled 
The Book of Needs. The title is taken 
from a book published by UNESCO 
in 1947, which assessed the losses 
and the global needs in education, 
science and culture at the end of 
the Second World War.

To understand the background of 
the international system during this 
period, it is important not to read the 
history of these early years through 
the lens of much later developments. 
Re-reading those formative years with 
what I have called a “period eye” allows 
us to appreciate the extent to which the 
international system – including UNESCO 
– existed on a shifting landscape, an 
unsettled firmament that would continue 
to be in motion to a greater or lesser 
degree over the succeeding decades.
Mark Goodale
In 1947 and 1948, UNESCO 
conducted a worldwide 
survey of a diverse group of 
intellectuals, political leaders, 
theologians, social activists 
and other personalities to 
gather their opinions on the 
philosophical foundations of 
human rights. A survey that was 
not widely publicized at the 
time, but one that is surprisingly 
relevant today.
The international system that was 
created in the aftermath of the Second 
World War took time to emerge. This is, 
of course, true institutionally – agencies 
had to be created, headquarters had to 
be built, staff and leadership positions 
had to be filled. The difficulties with this 
“practical” aspect of the new post-war 
order should not be underestimated. 
For example, during its first twelve years, 
the headquarters of UNESCO were 
located in the Hotel Majestic in Paris’s 
16th arrondissement, where bedrooms 
and bathrooms were used for offices 
and closets and bath-tubs were used to 
store files. 
But the complications were even greater 
at the political level. Although the general 
outlines of the relationships between 
the various international agencies were 
spelled out in charters and constitutions, 
the actual interactions between these 
organizations were ambiguous, to say the 
least, in those early years. 
Seventy-year-old views
that remain
contemporary 
Such a perspective is particularly 
pertinent in the area of human rights. 
The embryonic international community 
faced two main problems in 1945. The 
first was how to organize itself in a world 
devastated by global war and shaped 
by the contours of colonialism. Would 
Realpolitik continue to prevail – in a 
world in which national sovereignty and 
interests were paramount – or would a 
new, egalitarian model be created, one 
that would redistribute power along new 
political and geographic lines?

It was not entirely clear what would be 
needed for this “faith in fundamental 
human rights” to take more concrete 
forms. As the answer to the first question 
suggests, the powerful members at 
the core of the new UN system were 
reluctant to create any structure that 
could pose a threat – however abstract 
– to their political and legal prerogatives. 
Nevertheless, there was sufficient support 
for what United States president, Harry 
Truman, described as an “international 
bill of rights” that the UN Economic and 
Social Council (ECOSOC) created an 
international Commission on Human 
Rights (CHR) in 1946, with eighteen 
members and with Eleanor Roosevelt 
as its chair. 
Even so, the actual procedure through 
which the CHR was supposed to produce 
a bill of human rights was left open. More 
specifically, it was not at all clear in 1946 
how the CHR would establish the moral, 
religious and philosophical principles 
on which such a bill of human rights 
should be based. It was clear that they 
should be universal and not privilege 
any one national, regional, or cultural 
tradition. But where were such principles 
to be found? 
An unprecedented 
approach
It was at this moment that UNESCO 
boldly entered the picture. It should 
be remembered that Julian Huxley, the 
controversial and charismatic first Director-
General of UNESCO, had written a sixty-
page blueprint for the new Organization, 
titled UNESCO: Its Purpose and its 
Philosophy (1946). In it, Huxley makes 
the argument that a special international 
agency was needed in order to help the 
world overcome its many divisions. 
Huxley believed that this only would 
take place if what he called a “world 
philosophy” could be developed through 
cultural understanding, education, 
and scientific collaboration. For 
Huxley, UNESCO was to be this unique 
international agency, charged with 
overseeing the emergence of what he 
described as a “single world culture, with 
its own philosophy and background 
of ideas.” 
It was not surprising, therefore, that 
the proceedings of the first UNESCO 
General Conference in Paris took place 
in this spirit of visionary activism for the 
new Organization.  
The creation of the United Nations 
Security Council was the answer to the 
first question. Not only would the UN 
system be one in which the nation-state 
would continue to play a foundational 
role; it would be a system that both 
reflected and legitimated the fact that 
certain countries were more powerful 
than others. 
The second question was related to the 
first, but was even more complicated. 
Given the horrors that had been 
unleashed during the recent global 
conflict – horrors that followed only two 
decades after the unprecedented carnage 
and destruction of the First World War 
– what kind of moral statement could 
the international community make that 
would adequately express its collective 
outrage and hope, however utopian, for 
a better future? 
The answer, or the beginning of the 
answer to the second question, was to 
be found in the 1945 UN Charter, which 
examined the ravages of genocide and 
imperial militarism and nevertheless 
“reaffirm[ed] faith in fundamental human 
rights [and] in the dignity and worth of 
the human person.” 
Rights and freedoms don’t seem to 
me to exist on the universal scale (…). 
The very words cannot be interchanged 
internationally without ambiguity and 
misunderstanding (…). I am inclined 
to think that there is only one problem 
which is fundamental – the cause and 
cure of sadism and aggressiveness – 
and that until we have done something 
about this problem, it is merely futile to 
discuss human rights. At present we are, 
in a collective sense, savages, and not 
entitled to any human rights…

Working with a sense of urgency – since 
they worried that UNESCO’s human rights 
activities would be overshadowed by the 
much more high-profile labours of the 
CHR under Roosevelt – Huxley and Havet 
got right to work to design a procedure. 
After several false starts, they decided 
to do something unprecedented – to 
conduct a global survey among a diverse 
group of intellectuals, political leaders, 
theologians, social activists and others, 
in order to establish the philosophical 
principles of human rights. 
To do this, they prepared two documents 
– the first, an aide-mémoire, which 
provided a short history of national 
human rights declarations and outlined 
the important stakes involved in drafting 
an international declaration; and second, 
a list of specific human rights and 
freedoms that respondents were asked to 
consider in their replies. 
In March and April 1947, between 150 to 
170 of these surveys were dispatched to 
an impressive list of social institutions, 
state organizations, and individuals.

Around sixty responses were eventually 
received by UNESCO – they were not 
nearly as comprehensive as accounts 
of the process described, either at the 
time, or decades later. Nevertheless, the 
UNESCO human rights survey managed 
to capture a spectrum of viewpoints on 
the question of human rights that was 
arguably wider and more diverse than 
that produced by the CHR.
The verdict
Under Havet’s supervision, UNESCO 
convened an experts committee in 
Paris in late June 1947 to evaluate the 
responses and produce a report to be 
sent to the CHR, so that it could use 
UNESCO’s findings as the basis for the 
eventual human rights declaration. 
Apart from electing Huxley as its first 
head, UNESCO also established a number 
of major priorities for the coming year. 
One of these instructed the Secretariat 
to “clarify the principles on which might 
be founded a modern declaration of the 
Rights of Man” [Records of the General 
Conference, first session, 1946, p.236]. 
This was precisely the mandate that 
Huxley needed. In his view, a decisive 
intervention in the field of human rights 
would quickly establish UNESCO as the 
leading UN agency, the fulcrum of the 
post-war international system, with a 
unique role as the guardian of what he 
called a “unifying and unified” global 
culture.
The unit within UNESCO that was 
responsible for carrying out this mandate 
was the philosophy subsection of what 
was in the beginning the Subcommission 
on Philosophy and Humanistic Studies. 
It was headed by a young French 
philosopher, Jacques Havet, who had 
recently published a well-received book 
on Kant (Kant et le problème du temps, 
1947). Havet would go on to play a key 
role in UNESCO’s first human rights 
project, although the extent of his 
influence was not known until recently.

As scholars, international officials, 
and activists struggle to reassert the 
legitimacy of human rights in the face 
of contemporary challenges such as 
resurgent nationalism, the weakening 
of the European Union, and especially 
global inequality, the UNESCO human 
rights survey is proving to be an 
extraordinary, if unexpected, resource 
for new perspectives as well as, at least 
potentially, new solutions. 
Professor of Cultural and Social 
Anthropology and Director of the 
Laboratory of Cultural and Social 
Anthropology (LACS) at the University of 
Lausanne, Switzerland, Mark Goodale 
(United States) is the editor of the 
Stanford Studies in Human Rights series 
and the author or editor of thirteen 
volumes, including Letters to the Contrary: 
A Curated History of the UNESCO Human 
Rights Survey (Stanford, 2018). This book 
analyses dozens of recently discovered 
documents about UNESCO’s activities in 
the field of human rights during the first 
two years of the Organization’s existence, 
thus expanding and revising the general 
history of human rights.
The experts committee – E. H. Carr 
(chair), Richard McKeon (rapporteur), 
Pierre Auger, Georges Friedmann, 
Étienne Gilson, Harold Laski (see p.13), 
Luc Somerhausen, and Lo Chung-Shu 
(see p. 30) – debated the survey results 
and sent its conclusions to the CHR in 
August 1947. At the same time, they 
discussed the possibility of publishing 
some of the survey’s responses, which 
became the basis for the UNESCO 
volume, Human Rights: Comments and 
Interpretations (1949).
Meanwhile, throughout most of 1947, 
there was much confusion among the 
different UN states about just which 
agency was responsible for drafting the 
human rights declaration. Both Huxley 
and Havet had suggested that UNESCO 
was undertaking the survey as either the 
leading institution, or, at the least, in close 
collaboration with the CHR. Yet, when 
UNESCO’s report was finally considered 
by the CHR, in a closed session in Geneva 
in December 1947, it was met with 
confusion, and even anger. 
Apparently the majority of the CHR 
members had no idea that UNESCO was 
undertaking such a survey. In the end, by 
a vote of 8 to 4 (with one abstention), the 
CHR decided not to distribute UNESCO’s 
report to its member states or include 
it as part of the drafting process that 
would eventually lead to the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). 
Lessons for the future
Yet, in spite of the fact that the UNESCO 
human rights survey of 1947-1948 did 
not serve its original purposes, it remains 
strikingly relevant today. The responses 
offer a unique window into the diversity 
of thinking about basic issues of human 
dignity, society, and rights and duties, 
among many others, in the period before 
the UDHR codified a much more limited 
understanding of the Rights of Man. 
As recent research on the survey 
demonstrates, the ability to rewind the 
history of human rights back to this 
transitional post-war era has given us an 
unexpected treasure-trove of ideas at a 
moment in time in which the status of 
human rights is as threatened as ever.

Benedetto Croce 
For UNESCO to conduct “a formal, public and international debate 
on the necessary principles underlying human dignity and 
civilization” so that “the force of logic, culture, doctrine and the 
possibility of fundamental agreement would secure the triumph 
of free minds over the adherents of autocracy and totalitarianism” 
was the best way forward, advocated Italian philosopher 
Benedetto Croce (1866‑1952) in his text, sent to UNESCO from 
Naples on 15 April 1947, with the title “The Rights of Man and

Declarations of Rights (of the natural 
and inalienable rights of man, to quote 
the French Declaration of 1789) are all 
based upon a theory which criticism on 
many sides has succeeded in destroying: 
namely, the theory of natural rights, 
which had its own particular grounds 
during the sixteenth, seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries, but which has 
become philosophically and historically 
quite untenable. Nor can we argue from 
the moral character of such rights, for 
morality recognizes no rights which are 
not, at the same time, duties, and no 
authority but itself – this is not a natural 
fact but the first spiritual principle.

This, moreover, is already implied in the 
report you have sent me [Memorandum 
on Human Rights, 27 March 1947], when 
it says that these rights vary historically; 
thereby abandoning the logical basis 
of those rights regarded as universal 
rights of man, and reducing them to, at 
most, the rights of man in history. That 
is to say, rights accepted as such for 
men of a particular time. Thus, they are 
not eternal claims but simply historical 
facts, manifestations of the needs of 
such and such an age and an attempt 
to satisfy those needs. As a historical 
fact, the Declaration of 1789 had its 
importance, since it expresses a general 
agreement which had developed under 
European culture and civilization of the 
eighteenth century (the Age of Reason, 
of Enlightenment, etc.) concerning the 
certain urgent need of a political reform 
of European society (including European 
society in America).
Today, however, it is no longer possible 
to realize the purpose of the Declaration, 
whether of rights or of historical needs, 
for it is precisely that agreement on 
the subject which is lacking and which 
UNESCO desires to promote. Agreement, 
it is obvious, is lacking in the two most 
important currents of world opinion: 
the liberal current and the authoritarian-
totalitarian current. And indeed that 
disagreement, though moderated in 
its expression, may be discerned in the 
report I have before me.
Will this agreement be obtained? And 
by what means? By the reinvigoration 
of the current of liberalism, whose 
moral superiority, power of thought and 
persuasion and whose political wisdom 
and prudence will prevail over the other 
current? Or will it be through a new 
world war which will bring victory to 
one or the other side, according to the 
fortunes of war, the course of events 
or Divine Providence? And would the 
immortal current of liberalism emerge 
from its opposite, should the latter be 
temporarily victorious?
Is compromise 
possible?
I assume that UNESCO reckons with the 
first alternative or hypothesis and I need 
not tell you that, for my part, I am heart 
and soul in favour of this endeavour for 
which each of us is bound to work with all 
his energies and for which I myself have 
been working for nearly twenty-five years 
in Italy and also further afield.
If that is so, however, a working 
organization such as that you invite 
me to, and in which representatives of 
all currents, especially the two most 
directly opposed, will participate with the 
same rights, cannot possibly proclaim 
in the form of a declaration of rights, a 
declaration of common political action, 
an agreement which has no existence, 
but which must, on the contrary, be 
the ultimate outcome of opposed and 
convergent efforts. That is the point 
to be carefully considered, for it is the 
weak point. 
Nor do I even see how it would be 
possible to formulate any half-way or 
compromise declaration, which would 
not prove either empty or arbitrary. It 
may be that you and your colleagues, 
when you get to work, will discover 
the futility and the impossibility of it, 
and even, if you will allow me to say 
so, the danger of causing readers to 
smile at the ingenuousness of men who 
have conceived and formulated such a 
declaration. 
In my opinion, there is only one useful 
form of practical work for UNESCO 
to do: namely, a formal, public and 
international debate on the necessary 
principles underlying human dignity 
and civilization. In such a debate I 
do not doubt that the force of logic, 
culture, doctrine and the possibility 
of fundamental agreement would 
secure the triumph of free minds 
over the adherents of autocracy and 
totalitarianism, who are still reduced to 
reiterating the same slogans and the 
same sophistries to catch the public ear. 
Once that debate was held, it would 
no doubt be possible to formulate 
the declaration of certain historical 
and contemporary rights and needs 
in some such short form as the Ten 
Commandments or, if it were to include 
details, at somewhat greater length. 
An Italian philosopher, essayist and 
historian, Benedetto Croce (1866-1952) 
was a member of the Prussian Academy, 
of the British Academy, and of the 
American Academy of Letters. Noted 
for his literary criticism, he founded 
La Critica, a journal of cultural criticism 
in 1903, and was the author of almost 
seventy books.
We must not imagine that all nations 
have now reached the same degree 
of perfection in the recognition and 
guarantee of the rights of man. 
But the joint declaration will serve 
as a guide to the legislators of 
the different countries; it will 
encourage the expansion and 
improvement, along the same lines, 
of national declarations, which 
are still incomplete or inadequate, 
raising them to the level which 
all should attain

It must be remembered, further, that 
one of the main emphases which have 
underlain past Declarations of Rights has 
been the presumed antagonism between 
the freedom of the individual citizen 
and the authority of the government in 
the political community. It is not merely 
that the rights of the citizens have been 
conceived in individualist terms, and 
upon the political plane.

Against an
individualistic
impasse
Harold Joseph Laski 
“Any attempt by the United 
Nations to formulate a 
Declaration of Human Rights 
in individualist terms would 
quite inevitably fail,” wrote the 
British academic and politician, 
Harold J. Laski (1893‑1950). 
According to him, to go beyond 
these individualistic terms, the 
state must intervene to ensure 
a certain number of social rights 
for its citizens. This is an excerpt 
from his text, sent to UNESCO 
from London in June 1947, under 
the title “Towards a Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights”. 
All rights proclaimed in the great 
documents of this character are in fact 
statements of aspiration, the fulfilment of 
which is limited by the view taken by the 
ruling class of any political community 
of its relations to the security of interests 
they are determined to maintain.

Chinese-German artist Ji Kun, one of 
the participants in the Work Right! 
competition organized in 2014 by the 
human rights non-profit, 4tomorrow. 
It is of the first importance, if a document 
of this kind is to have lasting influence and 
significance, to remember that the Great 
Declarations of the past are a quite special 
heritage of Western civilization, that 
they are deeply involved in a Protestant 
bourgeois tradition, which is itself an 
outstanding aspect of the rise of the 
middle class to power, and that, though 
their expression is universal in its form, the 
attempts at realization which lie behind 
that expression have too rarely reached 
below the level of the middle class. 
“Equality before the law” has not meant 
very much in the lives of the working class 
in most political communities, and still less 
to Negroes in the Southern states of the 
United States. “Freedom of Association” was 
achieved by trade unions in Great Britain 
only in 1871; in France, save for a brief 
interval in 1848, only in 1884; in Germany 
only in the last years of the Bismarckian era, 
and then but partially; and, in a real way, 
in the U.S.A. only with the National Labour 
Relations Act of 1935; this Act itself is now 
in serious jeopardy in Congress.

There is the deeper problem that has 
arisen from the unconscious, or half-
conscious, assumption of those who 
wrote the great documents of the past 
that every addition to governmental 
power is a subtraction from individual 
freedom. Maxims like Bentham’s famous 
“each man is the best judge of his own 
interest” and that “each man must count 
as one and not more than one”, have their 
roots in that pattern of social organization 
so forcibly depicted by Adam Smith: 
in which, under any “simple system of 
natural liberty”, men competing fiercely 
with one another in economic life are 
led, each of them, “by an invisible hand 
to promote an end which was no part 
of his intention”, and that end, by some 
mysterious alchemy, is the good of the 
whole community. 
Even if it be argued – and it is at least 
doubtful whether it can be argued – that 
this liberal pattern was ever valid, it is 
certainly not valid today. There are vital 
elements in the common good which 
can only be achieved by action under the 
state-power – education, housing, public 
health, security against unemployment; 
these, at a standard acceptable to the 
community in an advanced society in 
Western civilization, cannot be achieved 
by any cooperation of citizens who do 
not exercise the authority of government. 
It becomes plain, on any close analysis, 
that so far from there being a necessary 
antagonism between individual freedom 
and governmental authority, there are 
areas of social life in which the second is 
the necessary condition of the first. No 
statement of rights could be relevant 
to the contemporary situation which 
ignored this fact. [...] 
Ideological differences
In the light of such considerations as 
these, any attempt by the United Nations 
to formulate a Declaration of Human 
Rights in individualist terms would 
quite inevitably fail. It would have little 
authority in those political societies which 
are increasingly, both in number and 
in range of effort, assuming the need 
to plan their social and economic life. It 
is, indeed, legitimate to go further and 
say that if the assumptions behind such 
a Declaration were individualistic, the 
document would be regarded as a threat 
to a new way of life by the defenders of 
historic principles which are now subject 
to profound challenge. Its effect would be 
to separate, and not to unify, the groping 
towards common purposes achieved 
through common institutions and 
common standards of behaviour which 
it is the objective of such a Declaration 
to promote.
Nothing, in fact, is gained, and a great 
deal may be lost, unless a Declaration of 
this character notes the fact of important 
ideological differences between political 
societies and takes full account of their 
consequences in the behaviour both 
of persons and institutions. To attempt 
to gloss them over would be to ignore 
completely the immense changes they 
involve in the attitude that a socialist 
society, on the one hand, even a society 
beginning to embark on socialist 
experiment, and a capitalist society, on the 
other, is likely to take to things like private 
property, law, both civil and criminal, 
the services of health and education, 
the possibility of living, between certain 
ages, without the duty to earn a living, the 
place of the arts – of, indeed, culture in its 
widest sense – in the society, the methods 
of communicating news and ideas, the 
ways in which citizens adopt a vocation 
in life, the conditions of promotion in 
the vocation adopted, and the relation 
of trade unionism to the process of 
economic production. [...]
Let us define man's chief right-duty in 
life as that of seeking, and if possible, 
finding himself in experience, i.e. of 
understanding as much as he can of 
the world, of himself and of the true 
relation between the two. A minimum 
guarantee against starvation is to be 
proclaimed as the first right of man; but 
the foremost right of man is a guarantee 
that he will be free to live his life in 
his own way

Human Rights, 1995, by Algerian-born 
Belgian artist, Boubeker Hamsi.The weight of 
the ruling class
It is difficult, moreover, to avoid the 
conclusion that was aptly formulated 
by Marx when he said that “the ruling 
ideas of an age are the ideas of its ruling 
class”. From that conclusion it follows 
that, historically, previous Declarations 
of Rights have in fact been attempts to 
give special sanctity to rights which some 
given ruling class at some given time in 
the life of a political society it controlled 
felt to be of peculiar importance to the 
members of that class. It is no doubt true 
that they were often, even usually, written 
out in universal form; perhaps even their 
claim to the status of universality gave 
them a power of inspiration beyond 
the area in which they were intended 
to be effective. But it remains generally 
true that in their application, the status 
of universality was always reduced to a 
particularity made, so far as possible, to 
coincide with what a ruling class believed 
to be in its interest, or what it regarded as 
the necessary limits of safe concession. [...] 
Towards a Declaration 
that is bold 
and concrete
An International Declaration of 
Human Rights which was based on 
these premises and built upon these 
conclusions, to which men and women 
all over the world might look for a 
programme of action, would be a 
valuable stimulus to the recognition of 
the need for reforms, any long denial 
of which is likely to result in violent 
revolution here, to violent counter 
revolution there, and perhaps, even more 
grimly, to international conflict which 
may easily assume the character of a 
global civil war. 
To provide the appropriate inspiration, 
such a Declaration would have to be 
both bold in its general character and 
concrete in its detailed conduct. It 
would have to take account rather of the 
possibilities which are struggling to be 
born than of the traditions that are dying 
before our eyes. It would be better to 
have no Declaration than one that was 
half-hearted and lacking in precision, or 
one which sought an uneasy compromise 
between irreconcilable principles of social 
action. A Declaration such as is proposed 
would do more harm than good unless it 
was issued in the confident expectation 
that the members of the United Nations 
gave to it an unquestionable faith 
and respect. 
An age like our own, which has seen the 
impotence of the League of Nations, the 
contemptuous disregard of the Kellogg-
Briand Pact and the cynical violation 
of international law and customs, and 
has lived under the barbarous tyranny 
of regimes which made torture and 
wholesale murder the sanctions of their 
policy, cannot afford another failure of 
so supreme a significance as this failure 
would mean. They have no right to offer 
hope to mankind who are not prepared 
to organize the essential conditions 
without which it has no prospect of being 
fulfilled. The next betrayal by statesmen 
of what the common man regards as 
the basis of his self-respect as a human 
being will be the prelude to a disaster this 
civilization is unlikely to survive.
A British political scientist and academic, 
Harold J. Laski (1893-1950) was a 
prominent member of the British Labour 
Party. He taught at McGill University 
in Canada, Harvard University in the 
United States, and the London School of 
Economics and Political Science in the 
United Kingdom. He was also the author 
of numerous books on democracy and 
socialism. Laski was one of UNESCO’s 
most ardent and valued collaborators on 
several of its early projects.

To banish poverty 
and want
Secondly, there is the need for 
guaranteeing a certain minimum 
subsistence for all, sufficient to banish 
poverty and want. This has two aspects. 
First is the guarantee through a 
comprehensive system of social security 
against loss of earning power from any 
of the risks to which the wage-earner is 
prone: risks arising from accident, sickness 
or old age. Second is a guarantee of 
certain minimum terms and conditions of 
employment: a prohibition of any contract 
of employment which fails to secure a 
certain minimum standard of earnings. 
This is not only a matter of aspirations: it 
is a matter also of attainment; while the 
standard that is regarded as the minimum 
standard – as “a living wage”– is itself 
subject to change from one generation to 
the next and varies with the level of social 
and historical development in different 
parts of the world.
Over large parts of the world, any 
desirable minimum standard is at present 
unattainable (even with radical alterations 
in the distribution of income) owing to 
the low level of productivity per man-
hour. Here the practical realization of this 
“right” requires a planned development 
of these regions as a prior condition 
(development which is systematically 
integrated under public auspices over a 
wide area, and not left to laissez-faire; and 
preferably development that is financially 
assisted from outside, provided that 
undesirable political conditions are not 
attached to such assistance). 
Maurice Dobb 
The right to employment, to social security, to a minimum wage, 
to the freedom of assembly and association, to free access to 
employment. These are the essential elements to integrate into a 
charter of human rights, in order to imagine a new kind of society, 
according to the British economist, Maurice Dobb (1900‑1976). 
Economic
and social rights 
A guarantee 
for everyone
Thirdly, it is necessary that rights of 
assembly and of organization should 
be guaranteed to all employed persons: 
moreover, that this right of organization 
should be made actual by extension of 
the right to all representative workers’ 
organizations to negotiate regarding the 
terms of their employment and to be 
represented on bodies responsible for 
controlling the conditions of work. It is 
manifestly inconsistent with the dignity 
of man that labour should be regarded 
(as hitherto) as a mere hired factor of 
production, excluded from any voice in 
the conduct of industrial policy. 
Fourthly, it is necessary that employment 
and access to the means of livelihood 
should be unrestricted by any 
considerations of race, creed, opinion or 
membership of any legal organization. 
Against private-owned 
monopolies
It can reasonably be held that ownership 
of the means of production (including 
land) by private individuals on such 
a scale as to imply that independent 
access to these means of production is 
barred for a substantial section of the 
community, represents an infringement 
of the economic rights of man in any 
full sense of the term. Where ownership 
of land and productive equipment is 
concentrated in the hands of a class, the 
remainder of the community is deprived 
of the possibility of a livelihood except as 
hired servants to the former – a situation 
which involves a substantial inequality 
of rights, de facto, and in an important 
sense, involves a deprivation of freedom 
from the class of non-owners. 
Such an interpretation of human rights is, 
of course, incapable of being reconciled 
with Capitalism as an economic system. 
Clearly, the notion of a declaration 
of rights which shall hold true of all 
times and conditions is too abstract to 
be tenable in this age, which is more 
conscious than its forbears of the 
historically-relative character of social 
and economic problems. Problems, 
needs, rights and duties only have a 
meaning within the framework of a 
particular set of social institutions and 
social relations – institutions and relations 
which are subject to historical change, 
and in the contemporary world are 
continually changing before our eyes. Yet 
declarations of rights can have a function 
in summarizing the aspirations of 
progressively-minded persons in a given 
age, confronted with the given situation 
and a given group of problems – as 
pointers to the direction in which efforts 
at social advance must be turned. 
Foremost among the requirements of 
any new society must be the attainment 
of full employment. This is nowadays 
a commonplace. But it has not always 
been so; and there are even some today 
who resist its attainment, or if they 
accept the ends, will not accept the 
means. Until recently, unemployment 
was considered to be either an inevitable 
accompaniment of so-called “free society” 
or even a desirable reserve without which 
a capitalist economy would lack a vital 
instrument of flexibility and of discipline. 
It is of interest in this connection that the 
1936 Constitution of the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) included 
as the first among its “basic rights of 
citizens”, “the right to work” ( Article 118).

In a more modified form, however, 
this interpretation could be held to 
debar the existence of private-owned 
monopolies which dominate whole 
industries and control the production and 
sale of essentials of human existence or 
essential raw materials and requisites of 
production, and which are accordingly in 
a position to dictate their terms to private 
consumers or to other producers.

Defeating the enemies of 
freedom
Aldous Huxley
Analysing the gravest threats facing humanity, the British novelist 
Aldous Huxley (1894‑1963) recommended that a world Bill of Rights 
should include efforts to increase available resources to meet the 
needs of the world's population; limiting the power of those who, 
through their wealth or hierarchical position, effectively dominated 
the masses of ordinary, unprivileged men and women who 
constituted the majority. He elaborated on these suggestions in his 
article, originally titled “The Rights of Man and the Facts of the Human 
Situation”, which he sent to UNESCO in June 1947. Excerpts follow.
Because of the mounting pressure of 
population upon resources, the twentieth 
century has become the golden age of 
centralized government and dictatorship, 
and has witnessed the wholesale revival 
of slavery, which has been imposed upon 
political heretics, conquered populations 
and prisoners of war. 
Throughout the nineteenth century, the 
New World provided cheap food for the 
teeming masses of the Old World and free 
land for the victims of oppression. Today 
the New World holds a large and growing 
population, there is no free land and 
over the vast areas, the much- abused 
soil is losing its fertility. The New World 
still produces a large exportable surplus. 
Whether, fifty years from now, it will still 
have a surplus, with which to feed the 
three billion inhabiting the Old World 
seems doubtful.
It should be added, at this point, that 
while the population of the planet as a 
whole is rapidly increasing, the population 
of certain extremely overpopulated 
areas in Western Europe is stationary 
and will shortly start to decline. The fact 
that, by 1970, France and Great Britain 
will each have lost about four million 
inhabitants, while Russia will have 
added about seventy-five million to its 
present population, is bound to raise 
political problems, which it will require 
consummate statesmanship to resolve. [...]
A constitutional Bill of Rights, whose 
principles are applied in specific 
legislation, can certainly do something 
to protect the masses of ordinary, 
unprivileged men and women against the 
few who, through wealth or hierarchical 
position, effectively wield power over 
the majority. But prevention is always 
better than cure. Mere paper restrictions, 
designed to curb the abuse of a power 
already concentrated in a few hands, are 
but the mitigations of an existing evil. 
Personal liberty can be made secure only 
by abolishing the evil altogether. 
UNESCO is engaged at present in 
facilitating the task of mitigation; but 
it is in the fortunate position of being 
able to proceed, if it so desires, to the 
incomparably more important task of 
prevention, of the radical removal of the 
present impedimenta to liberty. This is 
primarily an affair for the scientific section 
of the Organization. For the problem of 
relieving the pressure of population upon 
resources is primarily a problem in pure 
and applied science, while the problem 
of total war is (among other things, of 
course) a problem in ethics for scientific 
workers as individuals and as members of 
professional organizations. [...] 
The British novelist and critic 
Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) was best 
known for his dystopian Brave New 
World (1932), which vividly expressed his 
distrust of politics and technology in the 
twentieth century through satire. He was 
the younger brother of Julian Huxley, 
the first Director-General of UNESCO 
(1946-1948).
The increasing pressure of population 
upon resources and the waging, threat of, 
and unremitting preparation for, total war 
– these are, at the present time, the most 
formidable enemies to liberty. 
About three quarters of the 2.2 billion 
inhabitants of our planet do not have 
enough to eat. By the end of the 
present century, world population will 
have increased (if we manage to avoid 
catastrophe in the interval) to about 
3.3 billion. Meanwhile, over vast areas of 
the earth’s surface, soil erosion is rapidly 
diminishing the fortuity of mankind’s four 
billion acres of productive land. Moreover, 
in those countries where industrialism is 
most highly developed, mineral resources 
are running low, or have been completely 
exhausted – and this at a time when 
a rising population demands an ever-
increasing quantity of consumer goods 
and when improved technology is in a 
position to supply that demand.
Heavy pressure of population upon 
resources threatens liberty in several 
ways. Individuals have to work harder 
and longer to earn a poorer living. At the 
same time the economic situation of the 
community as a whole is so precarious 
that small mishaps, such as untoward 
weather conditions, may result in serious 
breakdowns. There can be little or no 
personal liberty in the midst of social 
chaos; and where social chaos is reduced 
to order by the intervention of a powerful 
centralized executive, there is a grave risk 
of totalitarianism.

The right to information is a natural 
extension of the right to education, and 
that very fact makes it possible to define 
its concrete content.
That content is sometimes defined as 
“facts” or raw news, i.e., news that is not 
interpreted. There should be no illusion 
about the practical value of the traditional 
distinction between fact and opinion. 
René Maheu 
“The same is true of the right to 
information as of all other rights: 
its legitimate content must be 
defined in terms of real needs,” 
wrote the French philosopher 
René Maheu (1905‑1975), 
adding: “Conditionally, of 
course, on the word 'needs' 
being understood to mean the 
needs of human development, 
and not of self‑interest or 
passion.” This is an excerpt of 
his contribution to UNESCO’s 
survey on the philosophical 
foundations of human rights, 
which he submitted on 
30 June 1947, under the title 
“Right to Information and to 
the Expression of Opinion”. 
Information as the means of 
free thought
For, in your tongue, I cannot fit, 
an installation by Indian artist 
Shilpa Gupta at the YARAT

The inclusion of the right to information 
among the Rights of Man means 
more than seeking a mere increase 
or improvement in the knowledge 
available to the public. It involves a 
radical reconsideration of the function of 
information. It means that the products, 
the methods, and even the organization 
of the news industry must be reassessed 
from the point of view not of the interests 
or prejudices of those who control its 
production, but of the human dignity 
of those who henceforth are justified in 
expecting of it the means of free thought.
From the moment that information 
comes to be regarded as one of the rights 
of man, the structures and practices 
which make of it an instrument for the 
exploitation, by alienation, of the minds 
of the masses, for money or for power, 
can no longer be tolerated; information 
becomes, for those who impart it, a social 
function in the service of intellectual 
emancipation.

What is a fact? A piece of evidence. 
And the selection of a fact is an implicit 
expression of opinion. There is nothing 
more misleading than the chimera of 
mechanical objectivity. Nor can human 
liberty look for salvation to the impersonal.
A better definition of information would 
probably be a detached presentation of 
materials capable of use by anybody in 
the formation of an opinion. Whereas 
an expression of opinion – whether 
persuasive or challenging – is always 
militant, the characteristic of information, 
unlike propaganda or publicity, which 
proceeds by obsession, is availability.
This being so, it will be asked whether a 
corollary of the recognition of man’s right 
to information is not an admission of 
the right of all to access to all sources of 
knowledge in all circumstances. Leaving 
out of account questions of physical 
impossibility, this straightaway suggests 
to the mind the many restrictions 
imposed for the protection of the most 
legitimate political, economic or personal 
interests: secrets of State, manufacturing 
secrets, domestic privacy.
A realistic appreciation 
of relativity
But the proclamation of the right to 
education does not ipso facto mean that 
the child has a right to learn anything, 
at any age, and anyhow. It only means 
that it is the duty of adults to give the 
child the knowledge necessary for his 
development in the light of his needs 
(and capabilities) at his age. A right is no 
more than an instrument – an instrument 
for building up man in man’s mind. And 
an instrument is only an instrument if it is 
related to needs.
The same is true of the right to information 
as of all other rights: its legitimate content 
must be defined in terms of real needs. 
Conditionally, of course, on the word 
‘needs’ being understood to mean the 
needs of human development, and not of 
self-interest or passion.
Of their very nature, those needs involve 
a large measure of recourse to human 
fraternity and to exchanges between 
men, an appeal that will always extend far 
beyond mere egotism. It is true, however, 
that, as there are great variations in living 
conditions and modes of development, the 
needs of human groups are not identical at 
all points in time and space. These groups 
do not all need the same information.
There must be no fear of introducing into 
a consideration of the rights of man this 
element of historical and sociological 
relativity. So far from putting in peril the 
effective achievement of those rights, 
only a realistic appreciation in the light 
of that relativity can give them concrete 
meaning for the men who must fight to 
make them triumph.
The right to the expression of opinion 
is much more closely geared to historic 
relativity. While the right to information 
must be numbered among the conditions 
of democracy and thus has the force of 
a principle, the right to the expression 
of opinion is part of the exercise of 
democracy and, as such, shares the 
relativity of all political realities or practice. 
A regime blessed with stable institutions 
and with a body of citizens apathetic or 
tolerant or whose critical faculties are 
highly trained, can give the freest rein to 
the expression of individual views. Indeed 
it must do so, in the sense that, more than 
any other, it needs that indispensable 
stimulus to maintain progress.
Against this, a democratic order in peril in 
a State torn by passion or possessed of the 
devils of credulity or, again, a democracy 
fully committed to a revolutionary or 
systematic process of reconstruction, 
is justified in imposing considerable 
limitation on the freedom of individual 
expression, the exercise of which is 
necessarily hostile to complete unity. 
Recognition that the right to the 
expression of opinion must be 
conditioned by the historical perspective 
of a particular democracy, is not 
sacrificing a human right to reason 
of State. On the contrary, that right is 
thus given its full meaning by refusal to 
sacrifice to an abstract concept the merits 
and chances of success of a concrete 
undertaking. [...]
French philosopher René Maheu 
(1905-1975) joined the staff of UNESCO 
when it was set up in 1946, and went 
on to serve two consecutive six-year 
terms (from 1962 to 1974) as Director-
General of the Organization. He was head 
of UNESCO’s Free Flow of Information 
division at the time he submitted this text. 
It would be proper, I think, for UNESCO 
to urge that the United Nations 
consider [human rights] as a minimum 
standard of national conduct and not 
as a fixed maximum which is static and 
rigid in its application. What we want 
to create is the notion that human 
rights should be always expanding as 
man’s control over his own behaviour 
and the forces of nature make possible 
an enlargement of opportunities 
for human development

A study of recent statements on human 
rights reveals the curious paradox that 
the one condition which is essential to 
their realization and proper use is hardly 
ever mentioned. Perhaps the omission 
of any reference to education can be 
explained on the assumption that it 
is taken for granted as a human right 
and as the essential foundation for the 
enjoyment of human rights. 
The history of education, however, provides 
ample evidence that education has not 
been regarded as a human right nor has it 
been used as an instrument for developing 
an appreciation of the importance of 
human rights for the fullest development 
of each individual as a human being. 
Historically two motives have dominated 
the provision of education. The first 
and the earliest motive was directed to 
indoctrinating the younger generation 
in the religious beliefs of their particular 
denominations. The second motive, which 
came with the use of the national state, was 
to develop a sense of loyalty to the political 
group or nation. In both cases, the ends 
that were sought emphasized acquiescent 
discipline rather than education for 
freedom as a human being. […] 
Because education has not yet been 
recognized universally as a human right, 
it is essential that it be included in any 
declaration of human rights that may 
be drawn up. The right to education 
needs greater emphasis than it is given 
in the Memorandum on Human Rights, 
prepared by UNESCO [27 March 1947]. 
Isaac Leon Kandel 
“Education for freedom does not mean, as it has frequently 
been thought to mean, a laissez‑faire programme of content 
or of methods of instruction, but the intelligent recognition of 
responsibility and duty,” wrote the American educator Isaac L. Kandel 
(1881‑1965), in his article “Education and Human Rights”, sent to 
UNESCO in 1947. Excerpts follow.
Two-tier education 
One of the tragic results of the traditional 
organization of education into two 
systems – one for the masses and the 
other for a select group – is that, even 
when equality of educational opportunity 
is provided, certain social and economic 
classes feel that the opportunities are 
not intended for them. The provision 
of equality of educational opportunity 
demands in some countries, measures 
to change the psychological attitudes 
produced by the traditional organization. 
Thus Henri Laugier, in discussing plans for 
the reconstruction of education in France, 
wrote [in the Educational Yearbook of the 
International Institute, Teachers College, 
Columbia University, p. 136 f, New York, 1944]: 
“So many generations in France have 
lived in an atmosphere of theoretical 
equality and actual inequality that the 
situation has in practice met with fairly 
general acceptance, induced by the 
normally pleasant conditions of French 
life. Of course, the immediate victims of 
the inequality are barely conscious of 
it or do not suffer from it in any way. It 
does not occur to the son of a worker or 
an agricultural labourer that he might 
become the governor of a colony, director 
in a ministry, an ambassador, an admiral, 
or an inspector of finance. He may know 
that such positions exist, but for him they 
exist in a higher world which is not open to 
him. Most frequently this situation neither 
inspires nor embitters him, nor does it 
arouse in him a desire to claim a right or to 
demand a definite change!” […] 
The recognition of education as a human 
right is, however, only one aspect of the 
problem as it concerns the Rights of Man. 
Free access to education at all levels may 
be provided without affecting either the 
content or the methods of instruction. 
Traditionally, the quality of elementary 
education differed from the quality of 
secondary education; the former was 
directed to imparting a certain quantum of 
knowledge, most generally to be acquired 
by rote and resulting in what the French 
call l’esprit primaire; the latter was intended 
to import a liberal or general cultural 
education. In neither case was there, except 
by indirection, any deep-rooted training for 
the use and enjoyment of those freedoms 
which are included in the list of Human 
Rights. The emphasis, particularly, since 
most types of education were dominated 
by exigencies of examinations, was rather 
on the acceptance of the authority – either 
of the printed word or of the teacher.
Freedom is not license
When the pendulum began to shift from 
an emphasis on discipline, indoctrination, 
and authoritarianism to an emphasis on 
freedom, it was too often forgotten that 
freedom is a conquest and that education 
for freedom of any kind demands a type 
of discipline in learning to appreciate 
the moral consequences of one’s actions. 
Education for freedom does not mean, as 
it has frequently been thought to mean, 
a laissez-faire programme of content or of 
methods of instruction, but the intelligent 
recognition of responsibility and duty. 
If this principle is sound, it also means a 
change in the status of the teacher and 
of teaching. If the teacher is to be more 
than a purveyor of knowledge to be tested 
by examinations, then the traditional 
limitations placed upon him by courses of 
study prescribed in detail, by prescribed 
methods of instruction, and by control 
through inspection and examinations must 
be replaced by a different concept of the 
preparation that is desirable for the teacher.

foundation for human rights

German artist Sarah Hartwig, judged

to Education competition, organized 
in 2014 by the human rights non-profit, 
4tomorrow. 
That preparation must be raised to 
the same level as preparation for any 
other liberal profession. If the efforts 
of the teacher are to be directed to 
the development of free personalities 
and to education for freedom of 
speech, expression, communication, 
information and inquiry, the teacher 
through his preparation should become 
professionally free and recognize that 
freedom without a sense of responsibility 
easily degenerates into license.
Before the Rights of Man can be 
incorporated into programmes of 
education, another change is essential. 
In the past, education has been used 
as an instrument of nationalistic 
policy, which too frequently meant 
indoctrination in either national or racial 
separatism and superiority. And even 
where the humanities formed the core 
of the curriculum, so much attention 
was devoted to the scaffolding that the 
essential meaning of humanism was lost. 
The common goals inherent in the 
ideal of the Rights of Man can only be 
attained as programmes of education and 
instruction are based on the realization 
that there is no national culture which 
does not owe far more than is usually 
admitted to the influence of the cultural 
heritage of man of all races and of all 
ages. It is upon this foundation that 
the freedoms included in the Rights of 
Man can be laid; it is only in this way 
that the true concept of humanism as 
an end in education can be developed. 
Their attainment, finally, depends upon 
training in the methods of free inquiry. 
Education for the various freedoms 
demands discipline. To paraphrase 
Rousseau, man must be disciplined to 
enjoy the freedoms which are his rights.

It is, in my opinion, 
a sign of respect 
for an absolutely 
essential freedom not 
to create in children, 
at an age when they 
are defenceless, any 
conditioned reflex 
(psychological or 
otherwise) that they 
would subsequently 
be incapable of making 
disappear. Respect for 
this freedom has as a 
corollary the prohibition 
against anyone teaching 
the child anything 
as an absolute and 
unquestionable truth 
that is not recognized 
as such by the majority 
of educated adults. 
This applies to religion 
as well as history 
A pioneer in the field of comparative 
education, the American educator 
Isaac L. Kandel (1881-1965) conducted 
extensive studies of education systems 
around the world. Born in Romania, 
of British parents, he was the author 
of more than forty books and over 
three hundred articles, the editor of 
several academic journals, and taught 
at his almae matres, the University of 
Manchester in the United Kingdom and 
Columbia University in the United States.

Path of thorns, 2014, by Senegalese 
artist Barkinado Bocoum.
Melville Jean Herskovits
How can individual rights be 
reconciled while respecting 
the cultural sensibilities of 
different human groups? For 
the American anthropologist, 
Melville J. Herskovits 
(1895‑1963), this is the main 
difficulty facing the formulation 
of a world declaration of human 
rights. He elaborates on this 
dilemma in this excerpt from the 
text with the title "Statement on 
Human Rights", which he sent 
to UNESCO in 1947. 
Individual rights and respect
for all cultures
The problem faced by the Commission 
on Human Rights of the United Nations 
in preparing its Declaration on the Rights 
of Man must be approached from two 
points of view. The first, in terms of which 
the Declaration is ordinarily conceived, 
concerns the respect for the personality 
of the individual as such, and his right 
to its fullest development as a member 
of his society. In a world order, however, 
respect for the cultures of differing 
human groups is equally important.
These are two facets of the same 
problem, since it is a truism that groups 
are composed of individuals, and human 
beings do not function outside the 
societies of which they form a part. The 
problem is thus to formulate a statement 
of human rights that will do more than 
just phrase respect for the individual as 
an individual. It must also take into full 
account the individual as a member of 
the social group of which he is a part, 
whose sanctioned modes of life shape his 
behaviour, and with whose fate his own is 
thus inextricably bound.
Because of the great numbers of societies 
that are in intimate contact in the modern 
world, and because of the diversity of their 
ways of life, the primary task confronting 
those who would draw up a Declaration 
on the Rights of Man is thus, in essence, to 
resolve the following problem: How can 
the proposed Declaration be applicable to 
all human beings, and not be a statement 
of rights conceived only in terms of 
the values prevalent in the countries of 
Western Europe and America? [...]

The disintegration 
of human rights
Over the past fifty years, the many ways 
in which man resolves the problems of 
subsistence, of social living, of political 
regulation of group life, of reaching 
accord with the Universe and satisfying 
his aesthetic drives has been widely 
documented by the researches of 
anthropologists among peoples living in 
all parts of the world.  
All peoples do achieve these ends. No 
two of them, however, do so in exactly 
the same way, and some of them employ 
means that differ, often strikingly, from 
one another.
Yet here a dilemma arises. Because of the 
social setting of the learning process, the 
individual cannot but be convinced that 
his own way of life is the most desirable 
one. Conversely, and despite changes 
originating from within and without his 
culture that he recognizes as worthy of 
adoption, it becomes equally patent to 
him that, in the main, other ways than 
his own, to the degree they differ from 
it, are less desirable than those to which 
he is accustomed. Hence valuations arise, 
that in themselves receive the sanction of 
accepted belief.
The degree to which such evaluations 
eventuate in action depends on the basic 
sanctions in the thought of a people. In 
the main, people are willing to live and let 
live, exhibiting a tolerance for behaviour 
of another group different than their own, 
especially where there is no conflict in the 
subsistence field. In the history of Western 
Europe and America, however, economic 
expansion, control of armaments, and 
an evangelical religious tradition have 
translated the recognition of cultural 
differences into a summons to action. This 
has been emphasized by philosophical 
systems that have stressed absolutes in 
the realm of values and ends. Definitions 
of freedom, concepts of the nature of 
human rights and the like, have thus been 
narrowly drawn.  
Alternatives have been decried, and 
suppressed where controls have 
been established over non-European 
peoples. The hard core of similarities 
between cultures has consistently 
been overlooked.
The consequences of this point of view 
have been disastrous for mankind. 
Doctrines of the “white man’s burden” 
have been employed to implement 
economic exploitation and to deny 
the right to control their own affairs to 
millions of peoples over the world, where 
the expansion of Europe and America 
has not meant the literal extermination 
of whole populations. Rationalized in 
terms of ascribing cultural inferiority 
to these peoples, or in conceptions of 
their backwardness in development of 
their ‘’primitive mentality” that justified 
their being held in the tutelage of their 
superiors, the history of the expansion 
of the western world has been marked 
by demoralization of human personality 
and the disintegration of human 
rights among the peoples over whom 
hegemony has been established. [...] 
A declaration 
with global influence 
The problem of drawing up a Declaration 
of Human Rights was relatively simple 
in the eighteenth century, because it 
was not a matter of human rights, but of 
the rights of men within the framework 
of the sanctions laid by a single society. 
A bill of rights for all the nations cannot 
be based solely upon the traditional 
values and ideological assumptions of 
any one of the nations. If it is to capture 
the aspirations and ideals of all 
the peoples of the world, it must be 
rooted in at least some of the accepted 
institutions and social doctrines 
of each and every people

The worldwide acclaim accorded the 
Atlantic Charter, before its restricted 
applicability was announced, is evidence 
of the fact that freedom is understood 
and sought after by peoples having 
the most diverse cultures. Only when 
a statement of the right of men to 
live in terms of their own traditions 
is incorporated into the proposed 
Declaration, then, can the next step of 
defining the rights and duties of human 
groups as regards each other be set upon 
the firm foundation of the present-day 
scientific knowledge of Man.
Known for his humanistic and 
relativistic study of culture, American 
anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits 
(1895-1963) is noted for opening up 
the study of the New World Negro as 
a new field of research. A specialist in 
African-American cultural and social 
issues, he taught at Columbia University, 
Howard University and at Northwestern 
University, Chicago, where he held 
the first chair of African Studies in 
the United States (1951).
Such persons, living in terms of values 
not envisaged by a limited Declaration, 
will thus be excluded from the freedom 
of full participation in the only right and 
proper way of life that can be known 
to them, the institutions, sanctions and 
goals that make up the culture of their 
particular society.
Even where political systems exist that 
deny citizens the right of participation 
in their government, or seek to conquer 
weaker peoples, underlying cultural 
values may be called on to bring the 
peoples of such states to a realization 
of the consequences of the acts of their 
governments, and thus enforce a brake 
upon discrimination and conquest. For 
the political system of a people is only a 
small part of their total culture.
Worldwide standards of freedom and 
justice, based on the principle that man 
is free only when he lives as his society 
defines freedom, that his rights are 
those he recognizes as a member of 
his society, must be basic. Conversely, 
an effective world order cannot be 
devised except insofar as it permits the 
free play of personality of the members 
of its constituent social units, and 
draws strength from the enrichment 
to be derived from the interplay of 
varying personalities.
Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, by the Italian illustrator 
and painter Alessandro Gatto.
Even then, so noble a document as the 
American Declaration of Independence, 
or the American Bill of Rights, could be 
written by men who themselves were 
slave-owners, in a country where chattel 
slavery was a part of the recognized social 
order. The revolutionary character of 
the slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity” 
was never more apparent than in the 
struggles to implement it by extending 
it to the French slave-owning colonies. 
Today the problem is complicated 
by the fact that the Declaration must 
be of worldwide applicability. It must 
embrace and recognize the validity of 
many different ways of life. It will not 
be convincing to the Indonesian, the 
African, the Indian, the Chinese, if it lies 
on the same plane as like documents 
of an earlier period. The rights of Man 
in the twentieth century cannot be 
circumscribed by the standards of any 
single culture, or be dictated by the 
aspirations of any single people. Such 
a document will lead to frustration, not 
realization of the personalities of vast 
numbers of human beings.

In each being dwells a light and 
inspiration which no power can 
extinguish, which is benign and tolerant, 
and which is the real man. It is our 
business to discover him, protect him 
and see that he is utilized for his own 
and humanity’s welfare. It is the nature 
of this man to search for the true, the 
good and the beautiful in life, to esteem 
them properly and to strive for them 
continuously.
The Hindu
concept of human freedoms
Shrikrishna Venkatesh Puntambekar
Criticizing the Western emphasis on reason and science that marked 
the emergence of European human rights doctrines, the Indian 
political scientist S.V. Puntambekar was of the opinion that “we shall 
have to give up some of the superstitions of material science and 
limited reason, which make man too much this‑worldly, and introduce 
higher spiritual aims and values for mankind.” He focused on the 
spiritual nature of human beings in his text, “The Hindu Concept of 
Human Rights”, sent to UNESCO in May 1947. Excerpts follow.
Then we must note that there is also an 
incalculable element in the human will, 
and an endless complexity of human 
nature. No system, no order, no law can 
satisfy the deep and potential demands 
of a great personality, be they religious, 
political, social or educational. Men are 
often endowed with great potential 
energy and creative power which 
cannot be encased within the bounds 
of old formulas and doctrines. No fixed 
discipline can suit the developing 
possibilities of new human manifestations 
in the psychological, ethical or spiritual 
fields. No system can satisfy the growing 
needs of a dynamic personality. There 
always remains something unthought of 
and unrealized in the system. Hence we 
want freedom for man in the shape of 
human freedoms.

Museum of 21st Century Arts (MAXXI) in 
Rome, Italy. Passers-by, who are part of 
the installation, form a human garland 
under the watchful eye of the artist, 
the Indian painter N. S. Harsha. 
The proper study of mankind is man. 
There is something more in man than is 
apparent in his ordinary consciousness 
and behaviour under a given system of 
environment – something which frames 
ideals and values of life. There is in him a 
finer spiritual presence which makes him 
dissatisfied with merely earthly pursuits. 
The ordinary condition of man is not his 
ultimate being. He has in him a deeper 
self, call it soul or spirit.

Freedom encourages 
growth
There is always a tendency for new values 
and new ideals to arise in human life. No 
ready formulas and systems can satisfy 
the needs and visions of great thinkers 
and of all peoples and periods. Freedom 
is necessary because authority is not 
creative. Freedom gives full scope to 
developing the personality and creates 
conditions for its growth. No uniformity 
or conformity or comprehension of 
all aspects of life will be helpful. The 
present centralization of all authority, its 
bureaucracy and party dictatorship, its 
complexity and standardization, leave 
little scope for independent thought and 
development, for initiative and choice. [...]
Can we be aware of a call for national 
freedom and for human freedom, when 
we are so rigid, inflexible, fanatic and 
exclusive in our political, religious, cultural 
and socio-economic outlook? Not having 
succeeded in disposing our rules and 
systems on all countries and continents, 
some of us still harbour feelings of 
superiority and hatred, coercion and 
dominance against our neighbours.
Therefore first let us “be men”, and then 
lay down the contents, qualities and 
interrelations of human freedoms. We 
must respect humanity and personality, 
tolerate our differences and others’ ways 
of internal and external group behaviour, 
and combine to serve one another in 
calamities and in great undertakings.
To talk of human rights in India is no 
doubt very necessary and desirable, 
but hardly possible in view of the 
socio-cultural and religio-political 
complexes which are so predominant 
today. There are no human beings in 
the world of today, but only religious 
men, racial men, caste men or group 
men. Our intelligentsia and masses 
are mad after racial privileges, religion, 
bigotry and social exclusiveness. In 
short, we are engaged in a silent war of 
extermination of opposite groups. Our 
classes and communities think in terms 
of conquest and subjugation, not of 
common association and citizenship. 
There is at present a continuous war 
of groups and communities, of rulers 
and the ruled, in our body politic and 
body social, from which all conception 
of humanity and tolerance, all notion of 
humility and respect, have disappeared. 
Bigotry, intolerance and exclusiveness sit 
enthroned in their stead.
The world is mad today. It runs after 
destruction and despotism, world 
conquest and world order, world loot 
and world dispossession. The enormous 
hatred generated against human life and 
achievements has left no sense of humanity 
or human love in the world politics of today. 
But shall we renounce “being men” first 
and always? What we want is freedom from 
want and war, from fear and frustration 
in life. We also want freedom from an 
all-absorbing conception of the state, 
the community and the church coercing 
individuals to particular and ordered ways 
of life. Along with this, we desire freedom 
of thought and expression of movement 
and association, of education and of 
expansion in the mental and moral spheres. 
In any defined and ordered plan for living, 
we must have the right of non-violent 
resistance and autonomy, in order to 
develop our ideas of the good human life.
Seeking higher 
spiritual values
For this purpose, we shall have to 
give up some of the superstitions of 
material science and limited reason, 
which make man too much this-worldly, 
and introduce higher spiritual aims 
and values for mankind. Then on that 
basis, we shall have to organize our 
social life in all its aspects. We want 
not only the material conditions of a 
happy life but also the spiritual virtues 
of a good life. Man’s freedom is being 
destroyed by the demands of economic 
technocracy, political bureaucracy and 
religious idiosyncrasy.
Great thinkers like Manu and Buddha 
have laid emphasis on what should 
be assurances necessary for man and 
what should be the virtues possessed 
by man. They have propounded a 
code, as it were, of  ten essential human 
freedoms and controls or virtues necessary 
for a good life. They are not only basic, 
but more comprehensive in their scope 
than those mentioned by any other 
modern thinkers. They emphasize five 
freedoms or social assurances and 
five individual possessions or virtues. 
The five social freedoms are (1) freedom 
from violence (Ahimsa), (2) freedom 
from want (Asteya), (3) freedom 
from exploitation (Aparigraha), 
(4) freedom from violation or dishonour 
(Avyabhichara) and (5) freedom from early 
death and disease (Armitatva and Arogya). 
The five individual possessions or virtues 
are (1) absence of intolerance (Akrodha), 
(2) compassion or fellow feeling 
(Bhutadaya, Adroha), (3) knowledge 
(Jnana, Vidya), (4) freedom of thought 
and conscience (Satya, Sunrta) and 
(5) freedom from fear and frustration or 
despair (Pravrtti, Abhaya, Dhrti).

More comprehensive 
freedoms
Human freedoms require as counterparts, 
human virtues or controls. To think in 
terms of freedoms without corresponding 
virtues would lead to a lopsided view 
of life and a stagnation or even a 
deterioration of personality, and also to 
chaos and conflict in society. This two-
sidedness of human life, its freedoms and 
virtues or controls, its assurances and 
possessions must be understood and 
established in any scheme for the welfare 
of man, society and humanity. Alone, 
the right to life, liberty and property or 
pursuit of happiness is not sufficient; 
neither, alone, is the assurance of liberty, 
equality and fraternity. Human freedoms 
and virtues must be more definite and 
more comprehensive if they are to 
help the physical, mental and spiritual 
development of man and humanity.
In order to prevent this open and latent 
warfare of mutual extermination – 
national and international – we must 
create and develop a new man or citizen 
assured and possessed of these tenfold 
freedoms and virtues which are the 
fundamental values of human life and 
conduct. Otherwise our freedoms will 
fail in their objects and in their mission 
to save man and his mental and moral 
culture from the impending disaster with 
which the whole human civilization is 
now threatened by the lethal weapons 
of science and the inhuman robots of 
despotic and coercive powers and their 
ideologies and creeds.
We in India also want freedom from 
foreign rule and civil warfare. Foreign 
rule is a damnable thing. This land has 
suffered from it for hundreds of years. 
We must condemn it, whether old or new. 
We must have self-rule in our country 
under one representative, responsible 
and centralized system. Then alone we 
shall survive.
I know that men who are devoted to and 
dominated by rigid ideas of cultures and 
religions cannot feel the call of national or 
human freedom. But we cannot give up 
higher objectives and aspirations for their 
sake and their prejudices.

It is not by self-isolation (as one 
might have thought), but by proper 
association with all other human 
beings that the individual can hope 
to achieve full development of his 
person (full development of energy 
and movement, and full development 
of consciousness particularly) since 
we cannot become completely 
“reflexive”, each of us, except by 
reflecting ourselves in and taking 
reflections from other human beings

“Revolution” is not regarded as 
a dangerous word to use, but as a word to 
which high ideals are attached, and it was 
constantly used to indicate a justifiable 
claim by the people to overthrow bad 
rulers; the Will of the People is even 
considered to be the Will of Heaven. In 
the Book of History, an old Chinese classic, 
it is stated: “Heaven sees as our people 
see; Heaven hears as our people hear. 
Heaven is compassionate towards the 
people. What the people desire, Heaven 
will be found to bring about”. 
A ruler has a duty to Heaven to take 
care of the interests of his people. In 
loving his people, the ruler follows the 
Will of Heaven. So it says in the same 
book: “Heaven loves the people; and the 
Sovereign must obey Heaven”. 
When the ruler no longer rules for the 
welfare of the people, it is the right of the 
people to revolt against him and dethrone 
him. When the last ruler Chieh (1818–1766 
B.C.) of the Hsia Dynasty (2205–1766 
B.C.) was cruel and oppressive to his 
people, and became a tyrant, Tang started 
a revolution and overthrew the Hsia 
Dynasty. He felt it was his duty to follow 
the call of Heaven, which meant obeying 
exactly the Will of the people to dethrone 
the bad ruler and to establish the new 
dynasty of Shang (1766–1122 B.C.) 
When the last ruler of this dynasty, Tsou 
(1154–1122 B.C.) became a tyrant and 
even exceeded in wickedness the last 
ruler Chieh of the former dynasty, he 
was executed in a revolution led by 
King Wu (1122 B.C.) who founded the 
Chou Dynasty, which in turn lasted over 
800 years (1122–296 B.C.). [...]
A Confucian
approach 
to human rights
Lo Chung-Shu
“The basic ethical concept of 
Chinese social political relations 
is the fulfilment of the duty to 
one’s neighbour, rather than 
the claiming of rights. The 
idea of mutual obligations is 
regarded as the fundamental 
teaching of Confucianism.” This 
is what the Chinese philosopher 
Lo Chung‑Shu (1903‑1985) 
wrote in his text, titled “Human 
Rights in the Chinese Tradition”, 
sent to UNESCO on 1 June 1947. 
An excerpt follows. 
Before considering the general principles, 
I would like to point out that the problem 
of human rights was seldom discussed 
by Chinese thinkers of the past, at least 
not in the same way as it was in the West. 
There was no open declaration of human 
rights in China, either by individual 
thinkers or by political constitutions, 
until this concept was introduced from 
the West. In fact, the early translators of 
Western political philosophy found it 
difficult to arrive at a Chinese equivalent 
for the term “rights”. The term we use to 
translate “rights” now is two words “Chuan 
Li”, which literally means “power and 
interest” and which, I believe, was first 
coined by a Japanese writer on Western 
Public Law in 1868, and later adopted by 
Chinese writers. 
This of course does not mean that the 
Chinese never claimed human rights or 
enjoyed the basic rights of man. In fact, 
the idea of human rights developed very 
early in China, and the right of the people 
to revolt against oppressive rulers was 
very early established.

The right to revolt was repeatedly 
expressed in Chinese history, which 
consisted of a sequence of setting up 
and overthrowing dynasties. A great 
Confucianist, Mencius (372–289 B.C.), 
strongly maintained that a 
government should work for the Will 
of the people. He said: “People are of 
primary importance. The state is of 
less importance. The sovereign is of 
least importance”.

No declaration of human rights will 
ever be exhaustive and final. It will 
ever go hand-in-hand with the state 
of moral consciousness and civilization 
at a given moment in history. And 
it is for that reason that even after 
the major victory achieved at the end 
of the eighteenth century by the first 
written statement of those rights, it 
remains thereafter a principal interest of 
humanity that such declarations should 
be renewed from century to century 
Mutual obligations
The basic ethical concept of Chinese 
social political relations is the fulfilment 
of the duty to one’s neighbour, rather 
than the claiming of rights. The idea of 
mutual obligations is regarded as the 
fundamental teaching of Confucianism. 
The five basic social relations described 
by Confucius and his followers are the 
relations between (1) ruler and subjects, 
(2) parents and children, (3) husband and 
wife, (4) elder and younger brother and 
(5) friend and friend.
Instead of claiming rights, Chinese ethical 
teaching emphasized the sympathetic 
attitude of regarding all one’s fellow men 
as having the same desires, and therefore 
the same rights, as one would like to 
enjoy oneself. By the fulfilment of mutual 
obligations, the infringement of the rights 
of the individual should be prevented. So 
far as the relation between the individual 
and state is concerned, the moral code 
is stated thus: “The people are the root 
of the country. When the root is firm, the 
country will be at peace.” 
In the old days, only the ruling class, 
or people who would be expected to 
become part of the ruling class, got 
the classical education; the mass of the 
people were not taught to claim their 
rights. It was the ruling class or would-be 
ruling class who were constantly taught 
to look upon the interest of the people 
as the primary responsibility of the 
government. The sovereign as well as the 
officials were taught to regard themselves 
as the parents or guardians of the people, 
and to protect their people as they would 
their own children. If it was not always the 
practice of actual politics, it was at least 
the basic principle of Chinese political 
thought. The weakness of this doctrine is 
that the welfare of the people depends 
so much on the goodwill of the ruling 
class, who are much inclined to fail in 
their duties and to exploit the people. 
This explains the constant revolutions in 
Chinese history. [...]

China University, Chengdu, Sichuan,

where official anxiety about sedition and 
allied offences leads to judicial and police 
practices, which in the metropolitan country 
would be regarded as unusually harsh.
The consequence is that the subject 
peoples as a whole, and particularly 
their more cultivated and better-
educated representatives, exhibit to a 
marked degree, the frustrations and the 
corruptions of impotence. For it should 
not be forgotten that, true as it may be 
that absolute power corrupts absolutely, 
the psychological effects of absolute 
powerlessness are no less damaging.
The general picture of a colony is of a 
territory where economic subordination 
entails political disability; where political 
disability may bring with it severe 
restrictions upon civil liberty and an 
exceptional widening of the legal meaning 
of the word “sedition” (such restrictions 
being at their most severe when the

Human rights for the
colonized
Leonard John Barnes
 “It might be predicted that when colonial peoples set about drafting 
a Bill of Rights, their claims will tally generally with those of depressed 
and disabled groups everywhere, but will also show a special 
distribution of emphasis corresponding to the special character of 
colonial disabilities,” wrote the British anti‑colonialist writer Leonard J. 
Barnes (1895‑1977). An excerpt of his article, “The Rights of Dependent 
Peoples”, sent to UNESCO from London in June 1947, follows.

For this reason, progressive movements 
among colonial peoples tend to assume 
a nationalist and liberationist form. 
They are liberationist because their 
awakening political consciousness sees 
the established constitutional ties with 
the metropolis as emblems of foreign 
domination. They are nationalist because 
separate nationhood is the repository 
of state power, and without state power 
at their disposal, the liberationists can 
neither sever their political and economic 
dependence on the metropolis nor take 
over the administrative functions of 
the metropolis after the severance has 
been made.
We should, therefore, see the colonial 
peoples both as aggregations of 
individuals repressed and thwarted 
by specific forms of disprivilege, and 
as emergent nations struggling to 
attain equal status with the so-called 
independent countries in point 
of sovereignty and international 
recognition. The claim – we emphasize 
this – is to formal equality of status. It is 
not to material equality of function. Nor is 
it necessarily to full national sovereignty 
in the classical signification of the term. 
Colonial peoples object to limitations 
of sovereignty when they are fastened 
on them from without, and appear as 
badges of inferiority. They might well 
accept limitations, provided they could 
do so of their own choice in the interests 
of effective international organization, 
and provided they were assured that 
the majority of other free countries were 
genuinely making the same acceptance.
Such is the position of the dependent 
peoples, and such are their needs or 
rights. The needs cannot be satisfied by 
legislative enactment, nor can the rights 
be guaranteed by constitutional charter. 
Attempts to give the force of unalterable 
law to the claims of particular groups 
or communities have often been made. 
But since no legislators can bind their 
successors for ever, the attempts prove in 
the end either fruitless or superfluous. [...]
 
A British anti-colonialist writer, journalist 
and educationalist, Leonard J. Barnes 
(1895-1977) worked in the British colonial 
office and had first-hand experience 
of colonial rule in South Africa, where 
he was based as a journalist. He is best 
known for his book, Soviet Light on the 
Colonies, published in 1944.
Human rights suggest rights which 
are alike for all human beings. Yet it is 
recognized that much of human nature 
is a product of the particular culture in 
which the individual has developed. 
Consequently, if all men have something 
in common which might provide 
the basis for a universal bill of human 
rights, it must reside either in common 
biological, psychological, or spiritual 
characteristics which persist in spite of 
cultural differences, or in those common 
elements of the many cultures which 
may be regarded as a world culture 
Quincy Wright (1890-1970)
American political scientist 
UNESCO survey, 1947-48
The reflection of 
frustrations
Formulations of human rights naturally 
tend to reflect the major frustrations of 
those who make them. If a right, declared 
and claimed, is to be more than an empty 
aspiration, if it is to serve as “a working 
conception and effective instrument”, 
it will express the natural demands of 
dissatisfied groups and of the have-nots 
of the social order. Liberty is the cry of 
the bond, equality the cry of the victim 
of discrimination, fraternity the cry of 
the outcast; progress and humanity are 
the cry of those whom their fellows use 
as means instead of respecting as ends; 
full employment is the cry of the worker 
whose daily job, or lack of job, stunts his 
soul and mocks his capabilities; social 
planning is the cry of those who are 
trampled underfoot when privilege and 
power strive to make the world safe for 
themselves. That is why declarations 
of the rights of man are strong allies 
of social progress, at least when 
they are first promulgated. For social 
progress is reorganization in the interests 
of the unprivileged.
Hence it might be predicted that when 
colonial peoples set about drafting a Bill 
of Rights, their claims will tally generally 
with those of depressed and disabled 
groups everywhere, but will also show 
a special distribution of emphasis 
corresponding to the special character of 
colonial disabilities. And in fact, wherever 
colonial discontent achieves articulate 
form, it shows a keen awareness both 
of the fundamental significance of an 
equity-less economy, with its necessary 
corollary of political subordination, and 
of the organic connection between 
these and the denials of civil liberty 
common in colonial territories. It is, 
further, ready enough to subscribe to 
the traditional democratic slogans of 
liberty, equality, and fraternity, partly 
because colonial peoples have wide 
experience of being used as means to 
other people’s ends, and partly because 
such slogans are handy for embarrassing 
the metropolitan authorities.
A colonial livery
But all these diverse sentiments and 
attitudes are given a particular colouring, 
they wear a particular livery, distinctive of 
colonial experience. This colour, this livery, 
is the claim to equal rights with citizens 
of the metropolis, the protest against a 
discrimination that appears, to those on 
whom it falls, to be as arbitrary as it is 
comprehensive.

A sacred and
universal
character for human rights
It is sad to admit that most men consider 
it their right to challenge the rights of 
others and even fight them. What is 
even sadder is that the present aspect 
of the world does not offer any hope for 
improvement in the near future. 
This should not however stifle our 
aspiration for a world where the 
sanctity of the Rights of Man would be 
an intangible evidence for everybody. 
Humanity has never been able to access 
this kind of happiness unless a growing 
number of individuals pursued with 
fervour, an ideal conceived a long time 
ago, until its accomplishment. All the 
progress of social thought or social 
sentiment that allowed for a life together 
without any discord could have been 
achieved only through the strength of 
such aspirations. 
We must not give that up. 
The heathens could always deny the 
immortality of the soul, and yet the 
believers will not stop to see it as a 
certitude. Even if the pagans were right 
today, the power of faith the believers have 
would one day make the soul immortal.
It will be the same with the Rights of 
Man if we do not cease to believe in their 
existence, even though they may remain 
unknown and ill-defined for a long time. 
The Archbishop could afford to slap 
Mozart in the face, without wondering 
whether he entered the history of music 
by that action. 
Who could guess then that the sense of 
honour associated with the artist would 
assume such proportions in the future? 
Who could have predicted that this 
or that artist would be disgusted with 
life after having surprised himself with 
unworthy thoughts? 
But who could have, on the other 
hand, envisioned that the injuries the 
critics dealt Wagner, Ibsen, Strindberg, 
Mahler, and others would be ultimately 
considered a mark of honour? Without 
such enemies we could not be truly great. 
When then will the rights of man – 
without, of course, preventing people 
from being forced to participate in 
injustice – make others understand the 
shame of inflicting such suffering? [...]
It is tragic that the rights of man are, like 
democracy, unable to defend themselves 
against attacks and against destruction. 
All that could be undertaken on behalf of 
these rights would indeed undermine the 
rights of the aggressor. Just as everything 
that tends to consolidate democracy 
is undemocratic.  
That leaves us only with having recourse 
to persuasion. 
It seems that the rights of man should 
be limited to a smaller number of claims 
that would not render this concept 
too ambitious. 
Most forms of belief are exclusive and 
antagonistic, sometimes even combative, 
provocative, aggressive. It would be a 
suicide for them to be tolerant. Let’s 
think, for example, about the communist 
or fascist States, where belief is a 
governing instrument. 
If there is a difference between the 
common law, the civil law and the rights 
of man, it should be limited to this: 
• The rights of man seek to balance powers 
and resistance even in areas where the 
common law has not yet found solutions. 
• We must find a minimum of rights valid 
for all peoples and all races. 
The task of formulating a Declaration 
of the Rights of Man clearly lies with 
an organization that purports to be at 
the “vanguard” of the progress of the 
common law. [...]
The difficulty of defining the rights lies in 
the opposition of interests we’re about to 
protect. Galileo who questioned Genesis, 
and the Church, which does not admit any 
violation of God's word, both need equal 
protection and both have equal rights. […]
A civilization and a culture based 
exclusively on scientific knowledge should 
put a stop to their progress in order to 
balance competing interests. After long 
centuries, no doubt, because powerful 
forces oppose it; moreover, all the interests 
involved are either unknown or fail to be 
revealed in time. But the study of rights has 
more refined instruments at its disposal 
and more requirements it must meet. 
Which leads us to the protection of honour. 
Arnold Schoenberg
“The heathens could always deny the immortality of the soul, and yet 
the believers will not stop to see it as a certitude. Even if the pagans 
were right today, the power of faith the believers have would one 
day make the soul immortal,” wrote Austrian‑American composer 
Arnold Schoenberg (1874‑1951) in the text he sent to UNESCO from 
Los Angeles on 21 July 1947, under the title “The Rights of Man”. 
“The same will apply to human rights, if we do not cease to believe 
in their existence, even though they should remain unknown and 
ill‑defined for a long time to come," he added. Excerpts follow.

Does the man have the duty to believe 
what is true? Does the right to believe 
what is falsehood deserve to be protected? 
The Ten Commandments are undoubtedly 
one of the first Declarations of the Rights 
of Man that have ever been formulated. 
They guarantee the right to life and 
the right to property; they protect the 
marriage, oath-taking and labour, but, 
as there is only one God, they deny any 
freedom of belief.
“How can I truly love the good without 
hating the evil?” Strindberg asked himself. 
Wherefrom the desire and even the 
obligation to fight evil. 
This is why some believe they must fight 
“bourgeois” art and others, the Palestinian 
style, which is foreign to our race and 
began with the great Adolf Loos. 
The fighter has the will and the duty to 
defeat, the will and the duty to oppress 
the conquered. 
But what is then to become of the human 
rights of those who believe in vanquished 
art forms or ideas? [...]
Is the right to be born one of the rights of 
man? Or is it the right to control births one 
of them? And does one have the right to 
starve those who are born in surplus? 
What do religions say about this? […]
We have there serious problems that 
could turn us into pessimists. 
Nevertheless, we must not give up our 
desire to bestow a sacred and universal 
character to the rights of man.
We have in our hearts the strength of 
desire combined with the intensity 
of creation. 
One of the most influential and 
innovative composers of the twentieth 
century, Austrian-American composer 
Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) 
created new methods of musical 
composition involving atonality. Like 
many other Jewish artists, Schoenberg 
emigrated to the United States in 1933. 
He taught at the Malkin Conservatory 
in Boston, and moved to California in 
1934, where he spent the rest of his life. 
He held major teaching positions at the 
University of Southern California and the 
University of California, Los Angeles, and 
became a US citizen in 1941.

At festive celebrations or solemn 
occasions, women traditionally perform 
songs together, while other members 
of the community, including men, are 
expected to remain silent and listen. 
Many of these female choirs, which 
sometimes perform for hours, have 
included songs condemning domestic 
violence in their repertoire. Publicly 
confronting the men in this way has 
proven to be far more effective than any 
recourse to formal justice – according to 
research conducted by the Cross Cultural 
Human Rights Centre, established by 
Chinese, African and European academics 
in Beijing, China, in 2014.
Another example of the effectiveness 
and social legitimacy of non-state 
mechanisms has been identified in India, 
where Nari Adalats, or women's courts, 
have been established in rural areas. They 
are presided over by women who have 
only a basic knowledge of the Indian 
Penal Code, but use mediation to resolve 
cases. In spite of some flaws, the informal 
courts are a good alternative to the 
lengthy and expensive procedures of the 
official courts – they receive local support 
and funding from the Indian government.
Initiatives that emerge from the cultural 
communities themselves are likely to be 
more sustainable and effective in the long 
run, than changes imposed by external 
actors or by the state. These systems that 
serve to protect communities need to be 
taken into account.
Different forms of 
thinking
Seventy years ago, UNESCO was 
saying exactly that, when it stated: 
“Such a Declaration (of human 
rights) depends, however, not only 
on the authority by which rights are 
safeguarded and advanced, but also 
on the common understanding which 
makes the proclamation feasible and 
the faith practicable.”
The Gacaca courts, which joined the 
process of national reconciliation 
following the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, 
are another well-known example of the 
use of traditional mechanisms. But there 
are many others.
Community alternatives
The Manden Charter, for example, 
is considered one of the oldest 
constitutions in the world, although it 
is oral and transmitted from generation 
to generation. Proclaimed at the 
beginning of the thirteenth century 
by the Mandingo Empire – which 
extended over a large part of West 
Africa in the Middle Ages – the Charter 
is composed of a “preamble” and seven 
“chapters” advocating social peace in 
diversity, the inviolability of the human 
person, education, the integrity of the 
motherland, food security, the abolition 
of slavery by razzia (a raid) and the 
freedom of expression and enterprise. 
These principles, that define the rights 
and duties of members of the Mandingo 
community, are still in force and are 
supported by the local and national 
authorities in Mali.
The Charter was inscribed by UNESCO on 
the Representative List of the Intangible 
Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009 
because it represents an eloquent 
example of traditional social and 
legal organization – which should not 
be forgotten.
At the other end of Africa, a community 
solution that has been established in 
Swaziland also merits our full attention. In 
this country, as in many others, a woman 
who is a victim of domestic violence has 
only one option to defend herself: to go 
to the police and file a report. But this 
is counter-productive, because if the 
husband is convicted, the breadwinner 
of the entire family ends up behind bars. 
This is why women have developed an 
alternative strategy. 
Human rights and
cultural
perspectives
Lionel Veer and Annemarie Dezentje
The current debates that 
question the universality of 
the Declaration of Human 
Rights are bringing to the fore 
the initiatives that UNESCO 
has been taking since 1947, to 
encourage the discussion on 
diverse cultural horizons.
Today, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights (UDHR) is widely accepted 
by most States and is an integral part 
of international law. Even so, it must be 
recognized that the global scene has 
changed since the Declaration’s adoption 
in 1948. Not only is the composition of 
the United Nations General Assembly 
more diverse, but States are no longer 
the only political actors. They must now 
deal with supranational, transnational 
and local actors who generate, 
reconstruct or challenge existing 
normative assumptions. 
Moreover, international human rights 
law is not the only normative order. There 
are other non-legal options, such as 
customary, religious, social and cultural 
norms, which are invoked to uphold 
fundamental human rights. 
In many African societies and some Asian 
countries, the rights and duties of human 
beings are observed in relation to the 
community rather than the individual. 
While liberalism focuses on the inviolable 
rights of the individual, Confucianism in 
China, for example, is more concerned 
with communal duties. In Africa, the 
ubuntu philosophy, based on notions 
of humanity and fraternity, inspired the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
in South Africa.

The UNESCO Courier • October-December 2018   |   37 
As evidenced in an earlier document, the 
Human Rights Memorandum of 27 March 
1947 [p. 6], UNESCO believed that “We 
must not…neglect the fact that in other 
parts of the world other human rights 
theories have emerged, are emerging, or 
are destined to emerge”.
After citing fascism as the perfect example 
of a political system that is theoretically 
unsustainable and has been completely 
discredited and defeated in practice, the 
Memorandum suggests that “a quite new 
formulation of human rights would be 
required to embody the views of a man 
like Mahatma Gandhi, or those numerous 
Indian thinkers who believe in the social 
importance and individual value of 
meditation and mystical experience.”
The document concluded that “we can 
be reasonably sure that the ferment of 
thought now apparent in the peoples of 
black and brown and yellow skin-colour, 
from Africa to the Far East, is destined to 
result in still other formulations.”
In spite of UNESCO’s efforts to expand 
cultural horizons, Asian or African 
traditions and philosophies were not 
taken into account when the UDHR 
was formulated. Although cultural 
differences were on the agenda, it was 
the Western perception of human rights 
that finally prevailed. It is based on 
the political philosophy of liberalism 
and focuses on the natural rights of 
the individual rather than on society 
and culture. Moreover, the process of 
claiming and implementing these rights 
is rooted in Western legal culture, in 
which states and legislators play the 
leading roles.
Over the past seventy years, cultural 
diversity, the influence of non-state 
actors and legal plurality have received 
increasing attention. This evolution 
must be taken seriously, so that 
the philosophy of the UDHR can be 
transmitted to local communities and be 
effective in their contexts and culture. 
The current debates on the virtual 
absence of non-Western ideas in 
human rights standards – which 
indicate the unease felt by a part of the 
world's population – illustrate that the 
discussion, initiated by UNESCO in 1947, 
was prematurely dismissed, and that it 
deserves to be reopened today.
Human Rights Ambassador for the 
Netherlands from 2010 to 2014, 
Lionel Veer is a senior diplomat. He 
was the Netherlands Ambassador and 
Permanent Delegate to UNESCO from 
September 2014 to September 2018. 
Specializing in Human Rights 
and International Politics, 
Annemarie Dezentje currently works for 
the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom 
Relations of the Dutch government. 
This excerpt comes from the report 
submitted on 31 July 1947, under the 
title, The Grounds of an International 
Declaration of Human Rights (p. 1), by the 
committee of experts that UNESCO had 
convened to participate in the process 
of drafting the UDHR. To this end, the 
Organization had launched a global 
survey on the philosophical principles of 
human rights [which is the topic of the 
main section of this issue of the Courier], 
in order to include key elements from 
various traditions and worldviews in 
the debate.
This document also affirmed the 
Organization's conviction that “the 
deeper the re-examination of the bases of 
human rights, the greater are the hopes 
that emerge as possible” [p. 3]. It also 
cautioned against the risk that differences 
in interpretation, linked to the diversity of 
cultures, could hinder the agreement and 
the implementation of the rights set out 
in the UDHR.

Under the pretext of helping 20-year-old Gisèle get rid of an evil eye, a friend 
of her parents took her to a deserted place and raped her. “I know he’s done 
it before,” she says. He had already raped two girls aged 12 and 15, whose 
parents are afraid to take action. Their parents don’t dare to do anything 
as they’re scared of what might happen. But Gisèle wants justice to be done.

Viviane
and millions of other women

Text: Katerina Markelova
This photo-reportage is published 
by the UNESCO Courier to mark the 
International Day for the Elimination 
of Violence against Women, 
25 November. 
The names of the women who 
participated in the photographic 
project have been changed for 
their protection.
Fortunately, more and more women are 
raising their voices to break the silence, 
overcoming feelings of shame and 
guilt – and often the fear of reprisals. 
Like four other Haitian women – one 
of them only a teenager – Marie chose 
to join this fight by participating in a 
photographic project. “Against Their 
Will” was launched in 2016 by Médecins 
Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders 
(MSF) in collaboration with the French 
photographer Bénédicte Kurzen.
“Let’s take the car, leave Port-au-Prince. 
Let’s go to Source Zabeth. I want to be 
photographed in traditional clothes, 
in the water, as if I were doing laundry.” 
For her photo session, Marie chooses a 
setting that symbolizes purification. She 
wants to be rejuvenated, to free herself 
from the horrible experience and to make 
a fresh start. “I’m going to move on. I want 
to become a journalist,” she declares. 
“It was impossible for me to approach 
these women solely from the point of 
view of the tragedy they have lived 
through, because they all sought 
to overcome it,” explains Kurzen. 
“That opened up new perspectives to 
the photographic narrative.”
Haiti, 2015. In the streets of Port-au-Prince, 
a 20-year-old student is looking for work. 
Let’s call her Marie. A young man offers to 
help her. “He said I should accompany him 
to his home to pick up some documents. 
When we got there, he pulled out a gun. 
That’s when it happened,” she recounts. 
Marie was raped. 
The story of this young Haitian woman, 
is, unfortunately, only one illustration of 
a much greater scourge. Violence against 
women knows no borders. Women across 
the world are being crushed under the 
weight of the suffering and stigmatization 
it causes, regardless of their culture, 
religion or socio-economic status. 
Considered taboo in most societies, 
violence forces many women to remain 
silent about their ordeal, and is often 
not reflected in statistics. Surveys 
among these women are often the only 
way to get an idea of the extent of the 
malaise. According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), one in three women 
in the world is exposed to physical or 
sexual violence during her lifetime.

In Haiti, where rape was recognized as 
a crime only in 2005 (it was considered 
indecent assault until then), twenty-
eight per cent of women aged 15 to 
49 reported experiencing some form of 
physical violence, and more than one 
woman in ten said they been subjected 
to sexual violence. 
According to The New York Times, 
following the earthquake that hit the 
Haitian capital in 2010, the rates of sexual 
attacks in the city’s makeshift camps 
was twenty times higher than in the 
rest of the country. MSF has pointed to 
inadequacies in the treatment of victims 
of sexual and gender-based violence, 
including a lack of institutions offering 
medical and psychological support, and 
the almost total absence of social and 
legal protection. 
To draw attention to this neglected 
problem – grossly underestimated in 
official statistics – the humanitarian 
organization launched its photographic 
project a year after it opened the Pran 
Men’m (‘take my hand’ in Haitian Creole) 
clinic in Port-au-Prince. In two years, the 
clinic has treated more than 1,300 victims 
of sexual aggression. The vast majority of 
these were under the age of 25. What is 
particularly disturbing is that fifty-three 
per cent of the victims were minors.
For UNESCO, educating young people is 
the only long-term solution to gender-
based violence. In spite of the alarming 
figures – about 246 million children are 
subjected to various forms of gender-
based violence each year – there are too 
few children and teenagers who receive 
a comprehensive sex education (learning 
the cognitive, emotional, physical and 
social aspects of sexuality) as part of their 
regular curriculum. Yet the benefits of 
such an education are undeniable – not 
only do young people learn to refrain 
from all forms of gender-based violence, 
they also learn to prevent it, recognize it 
and find help. 
UNESCO published a revised edition of 
its International technical guidance on 
sexuality education in 2018, produced in 
collaboration with UNAIDS, the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the 
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 
UN Women and WHO. The guide is 
aimed at education and health officials 
and other competent authorities, to 
help them develop and introduce sex 
education programmes and materials.

In a makeshift camp in Port-au-Prince, a man sneaks into a torn 
tent. Sarah’s alone, with no one to protect her. “He was someone 
we knew. He lived in the same area as us in the camp,” says 
the 13-year-old girl’s mother. Now she doesn’t want Sarah to do 
what the little girl has always loved doing: dancing. 
“I feel she is too visible when she dances,” she explains.

Asylum-seekers, awaiting a decision 
about their future, need basic 
language courses – especially if they 
are unaccompanied minors. For 
undocumented migrants, access to a 
basic education provides stability and 
a semblance of regularity in their lives, 
besides increasing self-esteem. The 
right to education requires states to 
provide access to educational services 
and financial resources, so that no one 
is deprived of basic schooling, at the 
bare minimum. 
The educational situation of asylum-
seekers and refugees in temporary 
reception camps across the borders 
of countries where conflicts occur (for 
example, Lebanon, Jordan, Greece 
and Turkey), is likely to be even more 
precarious. This could be due to a 
shortage of facilities such as buildings 
and school materials, a lack of qualified 
teachers, and scarce financial resources. 
Education
for migrants: 
an inalienable human right 
Fons Coomans
The right to education is often 
taken for granted – until it is 
taken away. An indispensable 
tool to protect the freedom 
and dignity of all migrants, 
education allows them to 
fully integrate into their new 
societies. This legitimate 
aspiration, however, faces 
obstacles on the ground. 
With its Ideas section, the UNESCO 
Courier marks the celebration 
of International Migrants Day 
on December 18. 
Who, in these cases, should be 
responsible for enforcing their right 
to education? The international 
community, of course, but that requires 
a determined commitment and a 
strong political will to protect those in 
vulnerable situations. Often, additional 
financial resources are required to meet 
the educational needs of these groups. 
UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, relies 
heavily on special donations for its 
educational programmes in refugee 
camps. If these children are denied 
a good basic education, an entire 
generation may be lost.
Enshrined in Article 26 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, education 
is an essential tool for the protection of 
human dignity. Human rights become 
even more meaningful when their 
realization is at risk – as when people 
are forced to flee from armed conflict 
or persecution, or simply because they 
want to improve their socio-economic 
condition. When they arrive in their new 
countries, their educational situation 
could be uncertain. 
For refugees, receiving an education is 
the best way to become full members 
of their host countries. Regular migrant 
workers and their children benefit 
intellectually and socially from attending 
school, where they learn about the 
society in which they are living.

What the law 
guarantees...
International human rights law 
guarantees an education for all, without 
discrimination. This principle of non-
discrimination extends to all persons of 
school-going age residing in the territory 
of a state, including non-nationals, 
irrespective of their legal status. Irregular 
or undocumented migrants can therefore 
invoke the right to education. This right 
creates immediate and unequivocal 
obligations – the state has no margin 
of freedom in this area. Discrimination 
on any ground is prohibited, because 
the very essence of the law is at stake. 
This implies an equal right of access 
to educational institutions, which can 
be described as the core, or minimum 
content, of the right. 
This follows from the universal nature of 
human rights. Special measures for the 
protection of the right to education can 
be derived from the 1951 Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees. 
Article 22 provides that states “shall 
accord to refugees the same treatment 
as is accorded to nationals with respect 
to elementary education” and “in any 
event not less favourable than that 
accorded to aliens generally in the same 
circumstances, with respect to education 
other than elementary education 
and, in particular, as regards access to 
studies, the recognition of foreign school 
certificates, diplomas and degrees, the 
remission of fees and charges and the 
award of scholarships.”
To this, Article 3(1) of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (1989) adds that 
“the best interests of the child shall be 
a primary consideration” in all actions 
concerning children. This includes the 
provision of educational services for 
all migrants.
The International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families 
(1990) guarantees that migrant workers, 
their children and members of their 
families, have equal treatment with 
nationals of the state of employment. 
Concerning the education of children, 
Article 30 stipulates that “Each child of a 
migrant worker shall have the basic right 
of access to education on the basis of 
equality of treatment with nationals of 
the State concerned. Access to public pre-
school educational institutions or schools 
shall not be refused or limited by reason 
of the irregular situation with respect to 
stay or employment of either parent or 
by reason of the irregularity of the child's 
stay in the State of employment.” The 
problem with this Convention is that it 
has not been widely ratified by the states 
of employment – probably because it 
contains very strong obligations.
At the regional level, the European 
Convention on Human Rights (1950) 
contains a clear-cut provision: “No 
person shall be denied the right to 
education”, (Article 2, of the first Protocol). 
Under European Union (EU) law, minors 
seeking asylum and refugees have access 
to education under the same conditions 
as nationals of EU member states. This 
right may be invoked by any person 
within the jurisdiction of a state party 
to the convention, therefore including 
irregular migrants. However, it is limited 
to education only at the primary and 
secondary levels. 
…and the problems 
on the ground
The implementation of the right to 
education for migrants poses a number 
of challenges and dilemmas for the 
governments of host countries. 
It may be in the public interest to prevent 
irregular non-nationals from becoming 
a part of society through education. 
This could be to limit the allocation of 
scarce resources only to those who have 
obtained a residence permit, or to ensure 
that migrant labour would be available in 
the future, as populations age.

On the other hand, newcomers have 
a legitimate interest in becoming full 
members of society, through participation 
and progressive inclusion. Education plays 
a pivotal role in this. States are free to 
decide how they allocate their financial 
resources, but while doing so, must 
respect the obligations of assistance and 
protection to which they have voluntarily 
subscribed by becoming parties to human 
rights treaties.
For example, the public interest may 
require the state to deter irregular 
migrants from leaving their country 
and undertaking a perilous journey to 
Europe. However, once these migrants 
have arrived, fundamental human rights 
must be respected. This does not mean 
that they should be given access to all 
services on the same basis as citizens 
of the host country. States may have 
a legitimate interest in restricting free 
access to higher education if that has 
the effect of attracting more irregular 
migrants. But states cannot restrict 
access to elementary or basic education. 
This right must be guaranteed in 
all circumstances. 
We know that some refugees will 
probably stay permanently, because it 
is impossible for them to return to their 
country of origin. It is therefore essential 
that national and local authorities 
anticipate and design educational 
policies that are culturally appropriate 
– enabling those who are interested to 
become integrated, with access to the 
labour market. 
Above all, a balance must be struck 
between the educational needs of young 
migrants and the differential treatment 
of citizens and non-citizens with respect 
to access to education. For instance, 
language instruction is recommended for 
migrants as soon as they arrive.
Ensuring access to education, housing, 
social and healthcare services and jobs for 
refugees is bound to impose a financial 
burden on governments. However, since 
a generous policy to welcome migrants 
can sometimes lead to misunderstanding, 
uneasiness and discontent among some 
citizens, governments must explain the 
reasons for their choices and justify them 
in light of other budgetary priorities, 
political interests and their international 
human rights obligations.
To conclude, it is important that the rights 
of migrants to an education are widely 
recognized as inalienable human rights, 
and not merely as goals to be achieved 
through public policy measures. National, 
local and school authorities must be 
aware of this, and act accordingly.

Building bridges, 
not walls
With more people than ever before 
on the move – either voluntarily 
or forced from their homes – there 
are enormous implications for 
education, that require flexible 
and innovative solutions. This is 
the central theme of UNESCO's 
2019 Global Education Monitoring 
Report, Migration, Displacement and 
Education: Building Bridges, Not Walls. 
It analyses several tried and tested 
solutions – with varying degrees of 
success – and concludes with a set of 
recommendations for policymakers 
working on the issue.
 Education has a direct or indirect 
influence over whether people move 
and where they move to. It affects 
their resilience, attitudes, aspirations, 
beliefs and sense of belonging. Yet, 
for many on the move, especially 
the displaced, the administrative 
or discriminatory barriers they 
face often impede their access to 
education entirely, even though it 
can provide a safe haven.
The annual report makes the case for 
education of migrants and refugees 
to be given priority in their host 
countries’ plans. Most migrants are 
talented and driven; many have 
overcome huge challenges in their 
bid to do better. Expanding access to 
quality education for people on the 
move improves their lives. 
Ignoring education in the response 
to migration is a failure to recognize 
its power to address diversity and 
promote inclusion. Through effective 
teacher training and teaching 
materials, a good education can 
provide people with the skills to 
engage with different cultures and 
challenge their own stereotypes. 
It can build much‑needed bridges 
across cultures and divides, and 
forge a path towards a more cohesive 
and just world.

Teachers in schools that host refugees 
often walk into the toughest classrooms 
in the world, day after day. A single 
classroom could contain many learners 
who have seen their homes destroyed 
and their relatives injured or killed. Some 
may have disabilities, either from birth 
or as a result of the violence in their 
home countries. They could be former 
child soldiers, survivors of sexual abuse, 
or children whose siblings were not 
lucky enough to escape to a safe place 
like they did. Their education may have 
been interrupted for weeks, months, or 
even years. 
The United Nations Refugee Agency, 
UNHCR, estimates that on average, 
refugee learners miss out on at least three 
to four years of education because of 
forced displacement – making their re-
entry into school a persistent challenge 
for education systems in general, and for 
teachers in particular. 
In 2016, there were 6.4 million school-aged 
children and youth among the 17.2 million 
refugees under UNHCR’s mandate. 
Helping teachers to

Fifty million displaced children

alarming figure released by 
the United Nations Children’s 
Fund (UNICEF) on World 
Refugee Day, 20 June 2018. 
Faced with the trauma and 
interrupted education of these 
children who are victims, 
teachers find themselves 
ill‑equipped to deal with these 
challenges – especially since 
many of them have little or no 
qualifications themselves. Now, 
several institutions in different 
countries are stepping up with 
initiatives to help teachers give 
their best.

Almost 3.5 million of these remain out of 
school – the 2.9 million who are able to 
enrol, often end up in overcrowded and 
poorly-resourced classrooms. At least 
20,000 additional teachers and 12,000 
more classrooms are needed each year to 
address the gap for the world’s displaced 
students alone.
The experience of Chaltu Megesha 
Gedo is inspiring. When she arrived for 
her first day of teaching in the Kakuma 
Refugee camp in northern Kenya, she 
was assigned a first-grade primary class. 
“These were children aged between 
5 and 10 years,” she recalls. “I entered the 
class and I was mesmerized – I did not 
know where to turn because there were 
250 of them!”
In Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, the 
scale of the challenge for teachers 
is daunting. Classes of ninety or a 
100 students are common, and classes 
with 200 children are not unusual. But 
help is at hand, with a programme that 
trains refugees to become teachers.

But even environments that are 
not optimal still present the best 
opportunities for refugee children and 
youth to transform their lives. Teachers 
remain the most likely catalysts for that 
transformation, and require targeted 
support that takes local realities 
into account.
Teachers in these schools may 
themselves be refugees, and have 
often experienced the same types of 
trauma as their students. This is why 
training programmes must address the 
psychological needs of teachers to help 
them grow professionally.
Innovative initiatives
A series of joint initiatives and innovative 
pedagogical approaches to support 
the preparedness and well-being of 
teachers working with refugees have 
been implemented. 
The Teachers in Crisis Contexts Training 
Pack (TICC) is an inter-agency initiative 
that synthesizes existing resources into 
a single comprehensive resource to 
encourage harmonized programming 
between partners in emergency 
settings. The resulting open-source 
teacher-training pack covers five areas – 
the teacher’s role and well-being; child 
protection, well-being and inclusion; 
pedagogy; curriculum and planning; 
and subject knowledge. Each domain 
focuses on building the skills required 
for unqualified or under-qualified 
teachers.
While the TICC was an important step 
towards establishing the minimum 
skills and classroom content needed, 
its development also underlined the 
ineffectiveness of stand-alone training. 
This awareness led to the launching 
of innovative initiatives like the 
Teachers for Teachers and the Borderless 
Higher Education for Refugees (BHER) 
programmes.
Global mentors
Teachers for Teachers is a joint initiative 
of Teachers College, Columbia University 
(United States) and Finn Church Aid, a 
Finnish non-governmental organization 
(NGO), in partnership with UNHCR 
and the Lutheran World Federation. 
It provides teachers with continuous 
professional development, using an 
approach that integrates training classes, 
peer coaching and mobile mentoring.
The training is based on the TICC, with 
teachers following two concurrent tracks 
– a short-term session of four days, and 
long-term training spread over several 
months. In addition, teachers are placed 
into small groups and assigned a peer 
coach who facilitates the learning circles 
and conducts classroom visits to aid 
each teacher. 
Mobile mentoring is perhaps the most 
innovative aspect of the programme, 
providing teachers with a “global 
mentor” available to them via WhatsApp 
and a private Facebook group. These 
exchanges help teachers feel they 
are part of a wider community of 
practitioners with whom they can 
share their experiences and obtain 
teaching advice.
Intercultural exchanges
The BHER programme provides refugees 
and local teachers residing in and 
around the Dadaab Refugee Complex 
(in Kenya, near the border with Somalia), 
an opportunity to acquire recognized 
teaching diplomas and degrees from 
Kenyan and Canadian universities. This 
unique consortium programme brings 
together Canada’s University of British 
Columbia and York University with 
Kenya’s Kenyatta University and Moi 
University, through a blended learning 
approach – combining online learning 
with face-to-face instruction provided 
by professors who visit Dadaab during 
school breaks and holidays.
A compelling aspect of the programme 
is that it enables intercultural exchanges. 
For example, some courses offer refugee 
students in Dadaab the opportunity to 
participate in virtual seminars together 
with students from Mae Sot, Thailand or 
Toronto, Canada. Through these cross-
cultural dialogues, students and teachers 
alike are able to question local teaching 
norms and gain new perspectives and 
ideas from other contexts.
While further efforts are required 
to ensure that all teachers working 
with refugees can be trained, these 
programmes are important examples – 
demonstrating effective and innovative 
ways of supporting teachers, even in the 
world’s most remote corners.
Connected Education Officer at UNHCR’s 
Division of Resilience and Solutions, 
Jacqueline Strecker (Canada) has been 
with the refugee agency since 2012. She 
has extensive experience in the provision 
of education in refugee contexts.
Providing education 
in crisis contexts
For millions of children across the 
world, going to school is sometimes 
interrupted by humanitarian 
emergencies, such as conflicts, 
natural disasters and disease 
outbreaks. One in six school‑age 
children are in a country experiencing 
conflict and protracted crises, 
according to the Global Partnership 
for Education (2016). In order to 
ensure that the – often life‑saving 
– human right of education is 
protected during these difficult 
times, the International Network 
for Education in Emergencies (INEE) 
is dedicated to providing quality, 
relevant and safe education to 
children impacted by crises. 
Comprising a global network of 
over 14,000 individual members 
and 130 partner organizations in 
190 countries, INEE’s members are 
practitioners working for national 
and international non‑governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and United 
Nations agencies, government 
officials, donors; students, teachers, 
and researchers – many of whom are 
from the affected communities – who 
voluntarily join in the work related 
to education in emergencies. Using 
a strategic plan to guide priorities 
and actions, the network provides 
support through community 
building, convening, knowledge 
management, amplifying and 
advocating, facilitating and learning. 
The International Institute for 
Educational Planning (IIEP), 
established by UNESCO in 1963, has 
played a key role in the development 
of INEE and the establishment of 
its internationally‑ recognized INEE 
Minimum Standards, which are now 
leading the way in coordinating 
quality education interventions 
before, during and after emergencies 
and during reconstruction. 
IIEP is a founding member of the 
INEE Working Group on Education 
and Fragility and also a member 
of the INEE Education Cannot 
Wait Advocacy Working Group, to 
ensure prioritized, protected and 
planned funding for education 
in emergencies.

In January 2014, Akil established his 
own business, Namaa Solutions, with a 
friend. Based in Gaziantep, Turkey, about 
twenty-five miles from the Syrian border, 
the startup harnesses his technical and 
entrepreneurial skills to develop digital 
and mobile solutions to address the 
needs of other Syrian refugees. 
 
Forging new lives, using
mobile technology
Christoph Pimmer and Fan Huhua
The case of Moujahed Akil, 
a Syrian refugee in Turkey, 
highlights the fact that 
innovative mobile learning 
practices are best driven from 
within the communities to 
address real needs, sustain 
development, empower 
members and maximize impact.
Addressing needs is key
Establishing the business posed its 
own difficulties: “The lack of funding 
and a sustainable model were major 
challenges,” Akil explains. But, he adds, 
“addressing needs is a key success factor. 
Syrian refugees in Turkey want this 
information, and now they have it at their 
fingertips.” The small business has grown 
rapidly, and employs a staff of twenty-five 
– the number of downloads of the app 
continues to grow. With 3.5 million Syrian 
refugees in Turkey, according to figures 
released by UNHCR, the UN Refugee 
Agency and the Government of Turkey 
in 2018, this is hardly surprising.
 
 
When Moujahed Akil fled Syria in 
September 2012 for fear of being 
arrested, one of the biggest challenges he 
encountered in Turkey, his host country, 
was not being able to communicate with 
the people there. 
“Not knowing the language was very 
hard, because I could not even discuss the 
most basic things needed to start a new 
life in Turkey,” he recalls. “For example, I 
went to the government building where 
nobody spoke Arabic, and we had to use 
our hands and feet to understand each 
other.” When Akil later obtained a mobile 
phone, he started using a translation 
app to find information relevant to his 
situation, and to fill in forms that he had 
previously photographed.
Akil, who was a computer information 
science student and an Information 
Technology (IT) freelancer in Aleppo, used 
his coding skills to find a job at a tech 
company. With the help of his Turkish 
colleagues and friends, he learnt the 
language before too long. He also learnt 
programming for mobile phones. His own 
early experience as a refugee inspired him 
to start working on a smartphone app 
to help Syrians to obtain all the practical 
and legal information they needed about 
resettlement issues and to build new lives 
in Turkey.

About ninety-four per cent of these 
refugees live outside refugee camps, 
fending for themselves, mostly in big 
cities. Namaa Solutions’ Gherbtna (“our 
expatriates” in Arabic) app helps them 
navigate the hurdles to access basic 
facilities such as healthcare and education. 
The app has several tools, including Video, 
Laws, Find a Job, Alerts, and “Ask Me”, 
providing answers to everything from 
legal advice and how to open a bank 
account, to housing, job listings, and 
even a directory for medical specialists. 
“Our ultimate goal is to reach all refugees 
around the world with the app,” Akil says. 
According to June 2018 figures released 
by UNHCR, the world is witnessing the 
highest levels of displacement on record. 
Out of an unprecedented 68.5 million 
people who have been forcibly displaced 
worldwide, there are nearly 25.4 million 
refugees, over half of whom are under the 
age of 18. 
“Many Syrian people are students who 
wish to continue their studies in Turkish 
schools and universities, and this is 
why education is the most relevant 
category on the Gherbtna app,” says 
the 29-year-old entrepreneur. The app 
provides information about schools and 
universities in which Syrian refugees 
can continue their studies, and lists the 
requirements and certifications needed to 
enrol. The second most popular category 
is information about the laws and rules 
to be followed during the integration 
process. After these two categories, the 
most popular app element is the “My 
story” feature, which is a platform where 
personal stories about Syrian refugees 
and their daily lives can be shared. 
Bridging a barrier
Sensing the giant barrier caused by 
language, and having experienced it 
first-hand, Akil launched Tarjemly Live 
(“Translate for me” in Arabic) in 2016. For 
a small fee (one Turkish lira, or $0.21 per 
minute), the app connects the user to 
a live human translator, who are often 
Syrian refugees themselves, with more 
advanced Turkish language skills. In this 
way, Namaa Solutions is also generating 
jobs for Turkish people with Arabic 
language skills. Online usage statistics in 
the first year of operation showed that 
seventy-seven freelance interpreters 
translated more than 37,000 words for 
17,000 minutes, using calls and texts. 
Over time, more than 1,500 text and 
video entries have been developed for 
the app, covering a wide range of topics. 
To complement the app, Gherbtna has 
a website and a Facebook page. “The 
Facebook page is a very strong component 
of the app, allowing us to directly interact 
with our users,” Akil explains.
Akil’s innovative spirit has not waned. 
New projects planned include a learning 
management system and interactive 
learning content for Syrian refugees. 
Another project is buy4impact.com, 
a trading platform that helps Syrians 
to sell hand-crafted products to an 
international market.
A researcher and lecturer at the 
University of Applied Sciences and 
Arts Northwestern Switzerland FHNW, 
Christoph Pimmer (Austria) specializes

a more cultural point of view, both in 
my discourse and in my subject matter. 
UNESCO provided me with the theme 
of the United Nations, founded on the 
fundamental idea of human rights and its 
universalist discourse – with all its ideas 
of progress and its future prospects, at 
a time when everything was yet to be 
constructed. 
Where does the title of the series, 
The Book of Needs, come from? 
The Book of Needs was published by 
UNESCO in 1947 to highlight the 
immense educational, scientific and 
cultural losses and needs in the world in 
the post-war period. In (March) 1948, the 
UNESCO Courier wrote about this, and I 
found it so emblematic that I used the 
same title for my series. 
Fernando Bryce:
History in the present tense
Interview by Carolina Rollán 
Ortega and Lucía Iglesias Kuntz 
(UNESCO) 
“Mimetic analysis” is how 
Peruvian artist Fernando Bryce 
describes his work process. It 
involves using ink on paper, and 
meticulously copying by hand, 
texts and images taken from 
magazines, political pamphlets, 
posters and old newspapers. 
Using this technique, he has 
captured moments from 
recent history, like the Cuban 
revolution, the Spanish Civil War 
and the Second World War, in 
his work. In 2015, our magazine 
was the source of inspiration 
for a series of drawings called 
The Book of Needs, to which a 
supplement of this issue of the 
Courier is dedicated. Let’s find 
out what it’s all about. 
Could you tell us about the work that you 
produced using the UNESCO Courier?
It is a series of eighty-one drawings 
that depict the work of the UNESCO 
Courier – from its founding in 1948, to 
1954 – based on images of its covers or 
on its articles. The series is part of a whole 
cycle which I have been working on for 
several years, with the iconography and 
representations of the twentieth century. 
These show temporary advances and 
setbacks in the world, and each series 
is constructed differently, with different 
types of images. I have just finished a 
series on the Second World War, using 
archival material that I found – in this 
case, film posters and newspaper 
headlines – that reported on war events. 
After that series was completed, in 2015 
I decided to approach my work from 
Fernando Bryce in front of UNESCO 
Headquarters in Paris, June 2018.
How did you access material from 
the UNESCO Courier?
I had already gathered a lot of material 
on UNESCO in the process of researching 
my previous work. I also had access to the 
digital resources of the Courier archives 
and the Berlin State Library. 
I must say that the magazine is 
fascinating – a fabulous historical 
document that deals with a very special 
moment, when the idea of progress 
was genuinely linked to a whole new 
perspective. A striking contrast between 
the convictions at the time and the state 
of the world today. 
What surprised me, when going through 
issues of the Courier between 1948 and 
1954, is the observation that many of 
the problems afflicting the world and 
humanity at that time remain the same 
today, and have not been resolved at all. 
Although the world has changed a lot, the 
issues that concern us remain the same.

More recently, in May and June 2018, I 
have exhibited the Freedom First series 
in Berlin, Germany, inspired by the 
publications of the Congress for Cultural 
Freedom, an association founded in Berlin 
in 1950 to campaign against totalitarian 
regimes. It is a retrospective look at the 
start of the Cold War. 
When did you come up with the idea of 
drawing inspiration from archives? 
Twenty years ago, I moved to Berlin. The 
city was going through a very significant 
period of transition at the time, and I was 
very inspired by the place – where there 
was a great debate about the concept of 
memory. At these historical moments, 
the notion of archives acquires its 
full meaning. 
What, according to you, are these concerns? 
Anti-humanist tendencies are the real 
political challenge facing an international 
organization like UNESCO. There have 
always been differences in worldviews 
and representations of the world, but the 
criticism of a certain universalism, which 
is too Eurocentric, or the current crisis 
of multiculturalism, cannot undermine 
the foundations of, and respect for, 
human rights. And, justly, human rights 
are a doctrine of faith for the United 
Nations and UNESCO – whether they are 
respected or not. 
As with your work with the UNESCO 
Courier, it is a constant in your repertoire 
to work with historical material and 
archives, which you transform into art. 
Could you describe this process? 
To begin with, there is always an interest 
in history, both in the sense of the event 
and in that of its writing. An archive is 
organized from the present and history is 
also in this present. The point of my work 
is to rescue this history and update it. I 
convert a documentary universe into a 
new reality, through drawing. In this new 
context, these creations can be viewed 
in a different light, in which documents 
are perceived as images. What I’m trying 
to do is a second-hand job, turning the 
document into a work of art. 
In addition to the series inspired by the 
Courier, I have worked on ARTnews, an 
American visual-arts magazine founded 
in the early twentieth century; Arte 
Nuevo, a Latin American art journal 
based in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and 
other magazines and publications.

Also, I was not satisfied with the artistic 
work I was producing at the time. It was 
then that I discovered the technique 
of ink drawing, which takes me back to 
writing without abandoning painting. 
This discovery, together with the notion 
of archives and visits to real archives 
– where the encounter with the past 
raises all kinds of questions – inspired 
a new artistic approach in me that has 
determined all my later work. 
Why did you select images particularly 
from those eighty-one pages and covers 
of the Courier and what did you want to 
draw attention to?
My work is a permanent process of 
selection. In this case, I chose images 
that seemed to me the most relevant 
to UNESCO’s mission, namely the fight 
against racist doctrines and the anti-
racist discourse launched by the UNESCO 
Courier, starting with the writings of 
Claude Lévi-Strauss, for example. I would 
like to refer here to the idea of the 
equality of peoples and cultures and 
the oneness of humanity. 
I also found vintage material related to 
decolonization, represented both by 
countries newly liberated from colonial 
rule and by the terminal efforts of a so-
called liberal colonialism that, until the 
mid-1950s, still believed that it could 
maintain its empire. And, of course, the 
question of so-called “primitive” peoples. 
In this respect, Claude Lévi-Strauss made 
a great contribution by stating that these 
peoples were not backward, but that their 
thinking was complex. Broadly speaking, 
I am interested in the correlation – 
highlighted in the Courier – between 
scientific progress and human progress. 
After the great catastrophe of the Second 
World War, there was a conviction that 
everything was possible and that the 
world would be a better place. Do you 
think this belief still exists? 
No, this faith no longer exists. We find 
ourselves at some sort of dead end, 
and we have to look for some. There is 
a sharp contrast between that period of 
optimism after the Second World War 
and the situation we find ourselves in 
today. Updating that material in the way 
I’ve tried to do is perhaps the mission of 
my work. From the territory of art and 
at a necessarily symbolic level where 
reflection and experiment go hand in 
hand, we artists may not have the power 
to change much, but we can, I hope, 
point out possible horizons. 
Born in Lima, Peru in 1965, Fernando 
Bryce began his studies in the plastic 
arts at the Pontifical Catholic University 
of Peru, before moving to France to 
continue his studies at Université Paris 8 
and the École nationale supérieure des 
beaux-arts. In the 1990s, he moved 
to Berlin, where he learnt the ink and 
paper technique and discovered 
the newspaper archives of the Berlin 
State Library. He now lives between 
Lima, Berlin and New York, where he 
recently exhibited his The Book of Needs 
collection. Completed in 2015, it can be 
viewed online on the websites of the 
Harvard Art Museums and the Alexander 
and Bonin gallery in New York.

What I also learned was that Mosul was 
a conservative city, whose inhabitants 
distinguished themselves by their sense 
of seriousness, effort and rigour. There 
was no room for nonchalance. This is 
probably why we rarely hear the Mosul 
accent in Iraqi music. With the exception 
of the great nineteenth-century 
composer, Molla Uthmân al-Mawsili 
and the Bachir family – notably Mounir 
Bachir (1930-1997), one of the greatest 
lute-players of all time – most of Iraq’s 
singers, composers and songwriters 
come from the country’s south. These 
artists are recognizable by their rural 
accents. And though recordings of a few 
songs from Mosul can be found on the 
internet today, they can be counted on 
the fingers of one hand. 
Mosul,
the city with two springs
Inaam Kachachi 
Iraqi novelist Inaam Kachachi 
describes the city she loves 
– Mosul the austere, 
Mosul the convivial, Mosul 
the contradictory, Mosul 
the wounded, bleeding to 
death. She tells us of her deep 
attachment to the ancient city 
of Nineveh, ravaged by history. 
With this article, the Courier joins 
the initiative launched by UNESCO 
Director-General Audrey Azoulay in 
February 2018, to revive the spirit 
of Mosul. This initiative aims to 
participate in the social and economic 
renaissance of Iraq and to contribute 
to sustainable development and 
intercommunity reconciliation 
through the safeguarding and 
appreciation of cultural heritage.

I then had to explain that although my 
mother and father were Christians, they 
were from Mosul and, as city-dwellers, 
they spoke Arabic at home. Chaldean, 
a recent variant of Aramaic – the 
language of Christ – was reserved for the 
inhabitants of Christian villages on the 
city’s outskirts. 
As a journalist, I have always written in 
Arabic. I know a smattering of Chaldean, 
just a few phrases and verses from 
songs sung at ceremonies. I grew up in 
Baghdad and was educated there. But 
it is Mosul that I love the most, that I 
consider home. A city surrounded by 
vast green plains, where we went for 
our Easter holidays – to enjoy the gentle 
climate, to savour the beauty of the 
gardens dappled with red poppies and 
yellow chamomiles. I had learned from 
early childhood that Mosul was a city 
with two springs, because autumn was 
like a second spring.
During a visit to the United States a few 
years ago, I remembered an Arab joke. 
A man sentenced to death was asked 
what his last wish was, before the rope 
was put around his neck. “I’d like to learn 
Japanese,” he replied. We, the people 
of Mosul, are in a somewhat similar 
situation. Condemned to exile, we dream 
of a return which is impossible. 
On the same visit, I was invited by a local 
Detroit radio station – run by the Iraqi 
community, which is quite significant 
in that city – to participate in one of its 
broadcasts. I was surprised to find that 
all the programmes on the radio station 
were in Chaldean, and I was therefore 
asked to speak in that language!

Was it the conservative nature of the 
Mosulites that made me the target of 
a little boy one day, who threw a stone 
at me, probably because I was wearing 
a short dress? It was a dress that my 
mother had made for me, especially for 
Eid – a red dress with a white Peter Pan 
collar, or a col Claudine, à la Française. 
And when I called a passer-by for help, 
the man scolded me, saying, “Go cover 
your legs, little girl!” The little girl in 
question was 7 years old and her dress 
was two centimetres above the knee.
But Mosul was both conservative and 
tolerant. Let me tell you a story from 
when my father – to whom I owe my 
love and great passion for the Arabic 
language, its poetry and literature – was 
a teenager. It is a story that illustrates 
just how civilized and tolerant Mosul 
used to be. 
Two stories of 
the Koran
Of all the students at his high school, 
my father was the best in the Arabic 
language. It was customary to offer the 
winning student a luxurious edition 
of the Koran. A few days before the 
awards ceremony, my father found the 
headmaster, sitting in a horse-drawn 
carriage – a common means of transport 
in the 1930s – waiting for him in front 
of the school. He beckoned my father 
to sit beside him and they went to the 
town’s main bookstore. “You can choose 
any book you like as a prize, whatever 
the price,” the headmaster said. For the 
Christian student, the message was 
unambiguous. He refused the offer. The 
principal tried again: “Abdel-Ahad, you are 
a Christian, and Mosul is a conservative 
city. We cannot give a copy of the Koran 
to a student who is not Muslim.” 
My father refused to budge, saying that 
he would not accept any other prize. The 
headmaster finally gave in, after making 
my father promise that he would accord 
the same respect to the holy book as 
it would get in a Muslim home. In the 
1960s, the same scenario was repeated 
with my elder sister, but this time with 
a different outcome.  
Since ISIS was defeated, music is 
no longer forbidden in Mosul. 
Khalid was the first musician to play

which rises again from the ashes.

A student in the Faculty of Arts at the 
University of Baghdad, she obtained 
the highest marks for her exegesis of 
the Koran. The head of department 
summoned her and asked her to 
renounce the prize, in order to save 
him from considerable embarrassment. 
How could he announce that a Christian 
student had surpassed her Muslim 
classmates in this discipline? This teacher 
clearly did not have the same courage as 
the headmaster of Mosul High School, 
thirty years earlier.

The 1948 war between Arabs and 
Jews triggered the departure of tens 
of thousands of Jews from Mosul 
(who, even today, have kept their very 
particular Mosul accents, wherever 
they moved). 
The Republic succeeded the monarchy 
in Iraq, against a backdrop of rivalries 
between political parties, and Mosul 
was not spared the bloodbaths caused 
by the fights between nationalists and 
communists. Then came the Gulf Wars 
and the American occupation. The entire 
country fell into chaos. But the worst 
was yet to come, with the occupation 
of Mosul by ISIS and what followed – 
particularly the expulsion of Christians 
and their exodus. The whole world 
watched helplessly as museums, ancient 
statues and monuments, bearing 
witness to nearly seven thousand years 
of civilization, were destroyed. 
On that day in June 2017 as I watched 
the destruction of the iconic Al Hadba 
(the hunchback) minaret of the Great 
Mosque of al-Nuri, on TV, I could not 
hold back my tears. This minaret, leaning 
like the Tower of Pisa, was the symbol 
of the city – it was on postcards, like 
the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, or 
the Egyptian Pyramids. I remembered a 
poem written in dialectal Arabic by my 
former professor, the poetess Lamiâa 
Abbas Amara, the day that Baghdad’s 
suspension bridge, the most beautiful 
in the capital, was bombed by American 
warplanes. “It’s my rib that is breaking, 
not the bridge”, she wrote. That’s exactly 
how I felt when Al Hadba was destroyed. 
But above all, it is human beings, who 
matter more than stones, who are the 
victims of dispersion, of extermination. 
It is with immense sadness that I realize, 
day after day, that I had anticipated this 
in my novel, Dispersés (2013). The exodus 
continues, and Iraq, particularly Mosul, 
is being emptied of its Christians.
The girls wore 
white shorts
Throughout my 60 years, I have 
considered myself an Iraqi. I have always 
refused to be called Christian, to be 
confined to a single community. When 
my books were translated into French, 
journalists asked me if I was a Shia or 
Sunni Muslim – I mocked their naïveté 
and refused to answer.  
“It’s my rib that 
is breaking…”
Mosul is on the Silk Road – and I am proud 
to tell my French neighbours that muslin 
(mousseline), the fine cotton fabric, 
originated in my hometown. In this city, 
the children of three great monotheistic 
religions, from many ethnic communities 
from Armenia, Turkey and the Balkans, 
lived together for a long time, in peace 
and harmony. But then, political strife 
began to poison the city’s atmosphere. 
But today, I proclaim my identity loud and 
clear – both in the interviews I give, and in 
my writing. Not in a communitarian spirit, 
but to testify to the luminous period 
during which I lived in Iraq – the country 
where I was born, where I studied, loved, 
where I started my family, where my 
eldest son was born – without anyone 
ever thinking of asking me what my 
religion was. 
Today, in Paris, my adopted city, I take 
great pleasure in reminiscing about Iraq 
with Safiya, a writer from Mosul who 
is over 80, and who emigrated like me. 
She tells me about her incredible life in 
Mosul in the last century. Although she 
was the daughter of a prominent imam, 
she dressed like her city friends in the 
latest Parisian fashion and had a full social 
and intellectual life. As female students 
attending a medical school founded in 
the 1960s, they played tennis with their 
male classmates and wore white shorts. 
Who could imagine such a scene today? 
Novelist and journalist Inaam Kachachi 
(Iraq) has lived in France since 1979, 
when she came to the Sorbonne to 
study for a PhD. She is the author of 
several novels, including Dispersés 
(originally published in Arabic, 2013), 
the French version (published in 2016) 
of which won the 2016 prize for Arabic 
literature, awarded by the Institut 
du Monde Arabe and the Fondation 
Lagardère; Si je t’oublie, Bagdad (2003) 
translated into French (in 2009); Paroles 
d'Irakiennes: le drame irakien écrit par 
des femmes (originally published in 
French, 2003).

Hence this new trend, all over the world, 
to make available sites and monuments 
for private events. There are always, as 
there should be, restrictions about the 
types of events allowed, the areas that are 
authorized for use, the number of guests 
and the hours of opening. 
There are many examples of this trend, 
worldwide. Weddings are held at the 
Royal Palace at Caserta, north of Naples, 
an Italian monument inscribed on the 
World Heritage List; at the Schönbrunn 
Palace, also protected by UNESCO; at the 
Belvedere Palace and Museum in Vienna, 
Austria; and at the Rodin Museum or 
the house of Victor Hugo, in Paris. You 
can even rent the Palace of Versailles, 
the iconic French World Heritage site, for 
specific types of events.
Some monuments inscribed on the World 
Heritage List are now being rented out for 
private events. Is this acceptable?
The question of how heritage sites 
should be used, merits some thought – 
considering that their original purpose 
may have been lost or changed over 
time. For example, railways stations have 
been transformed into museums, while 
convents and historic houses have been 
converted into hotels. 
A heritage building is steeped in historical 
and cultural values. The attributes that 
transmit these values may be tangible – 
such as the building’s design, its form or 
construction elements – or intangible, 
such as its different uses over time, or the 
traditions associated with it. The basic 
principle for the current uses of properties 
is that their new functions should be 
compatible with the preservation of their 
attributes and values.
Heritage for hire: 
a good idea?
Alfredo Conti, interviewed by 
Frédéric Vacheron 
Several high‑profile sites on 
UNESCO's World Heritage List 
can now be hired by the wealthy 
for a wedding or a private party. 
Does this trend risk tarnishing 
these places of great cultural 
value? “No,” says Alfredo Conti, 
Argentinian architect and 
heritage conservation specialist. 
According to him, it could 
even be a way to initiate a 
new section of the public into 
the cultural fold. 
There was a time when heritage sites 
were seen as sacrosanct, especially those 
sites that were most significant from a 
historical or artistic point of view. They 
had to remain frozen in a given moment 
of their history – their only possible use 
was to turn them into museums.
But not all historical buildings can be 
converted into museums, not least 
because heritage conservation is 
very expensive. Most of the time, the 
funding for conservation, maintenance 
and repair comes from the state. 
Admission tickets, the sale of souvenirs 
and catalogues, or providing cafeteria 
services can be a source of revenue, but 
as a rule these are not sufficient to cover 
costs. Government agencies often don’t 
have lavish budgets.

In the Americas, we have the case of 
Bogotá, in Colombia. The Manzana 
cultural district in the historical centre, 
includes several important museums 
housed in colonial buildings that can 
be hired for private events outside of 
museum opening hours. In the United 
States, Mount Vernon, the residence of 
George Washington, near Washington 
DC, has a very special place in the 
country’s history – but it can easily be 
booked on the internet for an evening. 
Are there other advantages to renting out 
these spaces, besides fundraising? 
Opening up these spaces for private 
events can be beneficial at a cultural 
level. These events often serve to attract 
a different kind of public unfamiliar with 
heritage sites – allowing them to discover 
the place, which may encourage them to 
return to explore the site more deeply. 
Several international documents 
stipulate that heritage must fulfil a 
function of public utility. The Norms 
of Quito, formulated in 1967 by the 
International Council on Monuments 
and Sites (ICOMOS), emphasize the 
economic value of heritage, suggesting 
that historic monuments can be 
considered tourist attractions and like 
natural resources, can contribute to a 
nation’s economic development. This 
was the first major document on Latin 
American monumental heritage. We have 
therefore known for over fifty years that 
heritage is not just a cultural resource, 
but also an economic one. It generates 
income that should contribute to 
its own conservation.
The UNESCO Villa Ocampo Observatory 
allows some of its facilities to be hired. 
What do you think of the way we manage 
this activity? 
Villa Ocampo has a very effective protocol 
for the use of the place – a zone system 
defines which areas can be used and 
under what conditions. For instance, 
private events are not permitted in 
the heritage rooms.
The Argentinian writer Victoria Ocampo 
did not see her house as a museum, 
but as a place that was full of life, 
where she received guests and held 
meetings and receptions. Today when 
the site is rented, a piece of this history 
is being perpetuated. 
An architect and urban planner, 
Alfredo Conti (Argentina) was 
Vice-President of the International 
Council on Monuments and Sites 
(ICOMOS) from 2010 to 2017. He is 
currently Academic Director of the 
Post-graduate Course on Heritage and 
Sustainable Tourism, UNESCO Chair for 
Cultural Tourism in Buenos Aires. Conti 
is also a researcher on the Scientific 
Investigations Commission of the 
Province of Buenos Aires, and director of 
the Institute of Research on Tourism at La 
Plata University.

Villa Ocampo, or 
UNESCO in Argentina
In 1947, Julian Huxley, UNESCO’s 
first Director‑General, was received 
by the Argentinian intellectual and 
philanthropist Victoria Ocampo 
(1890‑1979). This meeting allowed 
her to see just how much her 
opinions on women’s rights and 
her openness to the ideas of others 
were in harmony with the ideals 
promoted by UNESCO. In 1973, she 
donated Villa Ocampo, her house in 
San Isidro, near Buenos Aires, to the 
Organization.
Today, Villa Ocampo is the 
Argentinian office of UNESCO’s 
Regional Bureau for the Sciences in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, 
a place for study and debate, and 
a museum and documentation 
centre, with a collection of over 
11,000 books, 2,500 journals 
and 1,000 photographs. In 2017, 
it was inscribed on UNESCO’s 
Memory of the World Register, 
a programme for the preservation 
of documentary heritage.
The Transatlantic Dialogues in 
Villa Ocampo programme, which 
began in 2015, contributes to Villa 
Ocampo’s role as an observatory and 
laboratory for ideas.

The Synchrotron-light for Experimental 
Science and Applications (SESAME), 
is the first international centre of its 
kind in the Middle East. It is a powerful, 
high-precision research microscope. In 
it, the electrons accelerate very rapidly 
up to the speed of light in hollow and 
magnetized rings. The acceleration of 
these electrons produces packets of 
concentrated intense light. These beams 
are stored and directed to research 
samples because this light reveals new 
and deep dimensions in the researchers' 
samples. Research areas range from 
physics to molecular chemistry and 
nanoscience – with applications in 
archaeology, environmental sciences, 
agriculture, engineering, pharmacology, 
medicine and industry. Crystallography 
studies of synchrotrons have contributed 
to the award of five Nobel prizes in 
recent years.
Scientists from the Middle East – 
regardless of their speciality, nationality 
or religious belief – will no longer have 
to leave their own regions to carry out 
research in major centres abroad, or 
abandon their research interests because 
of a lack of advanced facilities at home.  
SESAME: 
Scientific excellence
in the Middle East
Anoud Al-Zou’bi
The SESAME international centre for scientific research, a 
competitive synchrotron light source and the first in the Middle 
East and neighbouring countries, was inaugurated in Allan, 
Jordan, on 16 May 2017. This pioneering project, established 
under the auspices of UNESCO, is the result of fourteen years 
of hard work, uniting eight countries around a twofold goal – 
to consolidate scientific excellence in the region and to build 
cross‑border collaboration, dialogue and understanding 
between scientists with diverse cultural, political and 
religious backgrounds.

At the SESAME centre, they can use 
synchrotron radiation to study samples, 
make new discoveries in different areas 
of science, analyse their results, and 
exchange data. The centre will enable 
them to establish research networks 
with other researchers in the region 
and with those working in over sixty 
synchrotron facilities in twenty-five 
countries around the world. About 
50,000 researchers worldwide use 
synchrotron facilities for their work.
SESAME is an intergovernmental 
centre with eight Member countries: 
Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, 
Pakistan, Palestine and Turkey. Observer 
countries include Brazil, Canada, China, 
the countries of the European Union, 
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, 
Kuwait, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and 
the United States. CERN, the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research, 
on which the centre is institutionally 
modelled, is also an observer. The total 
cost of the project, as of May 2017, 
is nearly $90 million.
The SESAME centre is a remarkable 
achievement for several reasons. First, 
it marks a return to the exact sciences 
in the Middle East, after a long absence 
stretching back to the thirteenth century. 
It enables a ray of hope in this region, 
recently marked by chaos, political 
conflicts, terrorism and economic gloom. 
Scientific research, cooperation and 
joint achievements can now claim the 
spotlight again.
An exceptional 
success story
Let us begin with a scientific fact: at 
99 degrees, water is hot; it does not 
boil or produce steam until it reaches 
100 degrees. This steam is used to 
power trains and factories, which 
laid the foundations of the Industrial 
Revolution. One little degree extra 
made all the difference and led to a 
massive revolution.
The same principle governs our lives – 
success alone is not enough; a further 
degree of performance is needed to make 
a real change and achieve excellence. 
In the traditional equation, success comes 
from a mix of patience, good preparation 
and determination. But in the merciless 
context of competition for scientific 
excellence, it also needs something extra 
– creativity, or the ability to go beyond 
the ordinary. It is this degree that makes 
the difference between work that is 
satisfactory and work that is excellent.
That is the story of the SESAME 
synchrotron. From the moment the idea 
first entered the minds of the researchers 
who supported this dream, they put their 
energies into its realization, every step 
of the way. They raised the necessary 
funding, built the infrastructure, trained 
staff, developed work plans and carried 
them out – right until the day of the 
inauguration. Without these extra 
steps taken by all the participants, from 
individuals to States and institutions, this 
pioneering scientific achievement would 
never have been completed.
From the time they realized that the 
Middle East needed its own advanced 
research centre, the scientists started 
working in earnest to make it happen. 
In 1997, Herman Winick of the SLAC 
National Accelerator Laboratory 
(operated by Stanford University for 
the US Department of Energy Office 
of Science) in California, United States, 
and Gustav-Adolf Voss (1929-2013) 
of Germany’s Deutsches Elektronen-
Synchrotron (DESY) Research Centre, 
suggested that the German Bessy I 
accelerator, when it was decommissioned 
in 1999, be donated to provide the 
nucleus of an electronic accelerator in the 
Middle East. 
This proposal was enthusiastically 
received by the scientific community. 
The director of the Middle East Scientific 
Cooperation group, Sergio Fubini (1928-
2005) and Herwig Schopper, a former 
director-general of CERN, proposed the 
project to the German government. 
The government agreed, once UNESCO 
provided the assurance that SESAME 
would be established under the 
auspices of the Organization, and that 
the financing of dismantling the facility 
and its transportation from Germany to 
Jordan would be taken care of.

UNESCO launched the project in 1999. 
Three years later, the Organization 
officially announced that the accelerator 
would be built under its auspices, as 
the project served its own objectives 
– namely, to reinforce security, peace 
and international cooperation through 
education, culture and science.
Divisions give way 
to humanism
Under the leadership of the then 
president of the SESAME council, Chris 
Llewellyn Smith, and the centre’s director, 
Khaled Toukan, seeing SESAME through 
to completion has required a continuous 
effort by all those involved – including 
participating countries, observers and 
donors – from the start of construction 
work in 2003 to the inauguration in 2017. 
Jordan donated the land and covered 
the cost of construction of the 
building. The International Atomic 
Energy Authority (IAEA) offered 
specialized high-level training and 
scholarships for researchers and staff. 
The European Union provided funding 
worth $18 million. CERN shared its 
wealth of experience during the 
construction of the magnetic system 
for SESAME’s storage ring. Other 
partners – organizations, States, and 
synchrotron centres around the world 
– provided advice and expertise, plans 
and equipment; perfectly illustrating 
the spirit of solidarity, cooperation, 
generosity and creativity.
On 16 May 2017, inauguration day, there 
was an atmosphere of joy, enthusiasm, 
pride and optimism – but it was also 
tinged with apprehension. Had all 
the obstacles encountered during 
fourteen years of hard work really been 
overcome? The answer could only be 
positive – yes, science has the power 
to unite and transcend divisions in the 
service of humanity.
Powered by 
solar energy
The SESAME synchrotron centre does 
not just owe its exceptional character to 
the fact that it is the first in the Middle 
East, or that it has succeeded in getting 
citizens interested in science while they 
were preoccupied with the ongoing 
conflicts in the region. It is also the first 
science laboratory anywhere in the 
world to be powered by solar energy.
Besides, SESAME has benefited around 
750 researchers and engineers in 
the Middle East, who have followed 
specialized training courses in research 
centres and laboratories in countries 
that are considered to be scientifically 
advanced. In this way, the centre helps 
to safeguard the scientific capital of the 
region, while curbing the brain drain 
and strengthening the participation 
of these researchers in the scientific 
and economic development of their 
respective countries. 
It has helped raise the level of scientific 
teaching and research in universities 
and research centres in the region, 
by building their scientific capacities, 
multiplying the number of active 
research projects − all at a low cost. 
The centre also serves as a bridge 
between the cultures of East and West 
and North and South, over and above 
strictly scientific matters.
The centre has received fifty-five 
proposals in response to its first call for 
applications for the use of its beamlines. 
Researchers from the region will now 
be able to make discoveries in scientific 
areas as varied as the early diagnosis and 
treatment of illnesses; the identification 
of plant diseases to save crops, and the 
analyses of ancient manuscripts without 
damaging them. 
Some challenges still need to be 
overcome, however. These include 
the further development of a user 
community, the development of 
new radiation packages, and the 
consolidation of the centre’s facilities, 
including an administration building. 
The running costs for the centre also 
need funding. But none of these 
challenges will discourage those who 
believe in the project and its objectives, 
as it represents both a victory for science 
and the embodiment of the idea of a 
common world and humanity.

It also aims to restore wetlands to combat 
the drying up of water sources and to 
encourage income-generating activities, 
such as the cultivation of spirulina – a 
green algae traditionally harvested by 
women in the region. Other actions 
include the protection of the Kouri cow, a 
species endemic to Lake Chad. 
The project is also designed to encourage 
countries bordering the lake to work 
together so that Lake Chad can one day be 
designated as a trans-boundary biosphere 
reserve. It also intends to strengthen local 
skills, so that these countries can nominate 
sites for inscription on the World Heritage 
List and help identify their Intangible 
Cultural Heritage.
Social cohesion is another key issue 
that the project will address. A series of 
annual meetings – or lake chats – will 
allow residents of all ages, ethnicities and 
religious affiliations to meet and express 
their different points of view. 
UNESCO, on
Lake Chad’s side 
Agnès Bardon (UNESCO)
In February 2018, UNESCO 
launched a major project to 
strengthen the resilience of 
people living in the Lake Chad 
basin, who have been affected 
by a devastating drought for 
the last four decades. 
The BIOsphere and Heritage of Lake 
Chad (BIOPALT) project has set itself an 
ambitious objective – to enable local 
inhabitants to live and work peacefully 
on the shores of Lake Chad. Presented 
by UNESCO on 26 February 2018 at 
an international conference in Abuja, 
Nigeria, the project aims to take stock of 
the region’s natural resources so that they 
can be managed more sustainably. Pilot 
actions to restore various ecosystems 
and foster the development of a green 
economy will also be carried out. 
The challenges are enormous. The Lake 
Chad basin is a freshwater source for over 
40 million people.

Reduced rainfall between 1960 and 1985 
caused the surface area of the lake to 
shrink by more than ninety per cent. This 
dramatic drying-up of the lake has had 
major consequences for the environment 
and the economy, plunging thousands 
of people into poverty and forcing them 
into exile to escape the region, which is 
also plagued by conflicts and insecurity. 
To cope with the scale of this ecological 
disaster, BIOPALT has a budget to match. 
Nearly $6.5 million have been allocated 
by the African Development Bank, over 
a three-year period, for the five countries 
involved – Cameroon, Central African 
Republic, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. The 
project is being implemented by UNESCO, 
in partnership with the Lake Chad Basin 
Commission (LCBC), the body that 
coordinates the actions of States that are 
stakeholders in the basin’s water resources.
BIOPALT plans to map the water 
resources in the region and rehabilitate 
wildlife migration corridors – especially 
for elephants – between Cameroon, 
Chad and Nigeria.

The image I have of my grandfather is of 
a man surrounded by books. He always 
had a dictionary at hand. In fact, he was 
a polyglot – he had a perfect command 
of English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, 
Italian, Hebrew and Mandarin. I often saw 
him making notes in a big, black dictionary, 
his Chinese dictionary – the language he 
liked the most and ended up speaking 
seven dialects of! Amazingly, in his house, 
we were allowed to write in the dictionaries. 
With him, the book became a living thing. 
Much more than just something to be used, 
a book was like a member of the family, 
inviting itself to our table at any moment 
during the meal.
Sandy was quick-minded, enthusiastic, 
imaginative and curious. He was always 
learning something new, and loved to 
share with his family – and as many others 
as possible – the pleasure of studying.

Seventy years after the first 
issue of the UNESCO Courier 
was published, we pay an 
intimate homage to its founder, 
Sandy Koffler (1916‑2002), 
inviting his granddaughter, 
Aurélia Dausse, to share some of 
her memories and excerpts from 
his notebooks.
The UNESCO Courier is 70!
Remembering Sandy Koffler,
my grandfather
This is what he did throughout his life as a 
journalist, and particularly during his time 
at the UNESCO Courier.
Sandy passed away in 2002. He left 
behind a treasure-trove, which I recently 
discovered when I started researching 
my family history – his personal war 
diary, his letters, notebooks, photos and 
a complete, bound collection of the 
Courier. It includes many snippets of life 
that describe the remarkable journey of 
an exceptional man. I am deeply moved 
to be able to render homage to him, in 
the pages of the very journal he founded 
and edited for thirty years, from February 
1948 to January 1977.

The UNESCO Courier is 70! 70
The UNESCO Courier • October-December 2018   |   69 
New York to Paris, 
and back again
Sandy Koffler was born in New York, the 
son of immigrants originally from the 
town of Chernivtsi, in Bucovina, Romania 
(now a city in western Ukraine). Like 
many other immigrants, they arrived 
in the United States via Ellis Island, the 
small island (in New York Harbor) that 
housed the federal immigration station. 
His father, Berl Koffler, after a modest start 
selling soda water on the street, became a 
well-known rabbi in the city. He moved to 
Williamsburg, in Brooklyn, where Sandy 
was born on 24 October 1916. 
After attending New York’s City College, 
Sandy won a scholarship to study at the 
Sorbonne in Paris. In 1940, while he was 
studying in Bordeaux, the American 
consulate advised him to leave France 
because he was Jewish. Passionate about 
French culture and language, he was 
reluctant to go, not least because his love 
life also tied him to Bordeaux. He was also 
sure that his American citizenship would 
protect him. But when the Nazis invaded 
France, he finally went to Marseille to 
board one of the last ships leaving for 
the US. During a lengthy stop-over in 
Portugal, Sandy seized the opportunity to 
learn Portuguese.
Life in New York
Back in New York, Sandy became a 
part-time columnist for the weekly 
magazine America, and also learned the 
techniques of printmaking. Around that 
time, he attended seminars by the French 
anthropologist, Claude Lévi-Strauss, 
at the New School for Social Research. 
Lévi-Strauss had also left France just 
before the Occupation, and the two men 
became friends. 
Several years later, they would meet up 
again in Paris – one as Editor-in-Chief 
of the Courier, the other as one of the 
authors of the first UNESCO Statement on 
Race (1950), and the author of Race and 
History (1952), one of the great classics 
of anti-racist literature. Koffler would 
regularly invite Lévi-Strauss to contribute 
to the Courier during the 1950s, so that 
many of the fundamental articles on 
anthropology were first published in the 
Courier, before being reprinted in books. 
[Editor’s note: a special issue of the Courier 
with most of Lévy-Strauss’s articles was 
published in 2008, with the title Claude 
Lévi-Strauss: The View from Afar.] 
The climate of war motivated Sandy 
to sign up and work for the US Army’s 
Psychological Warfare Branch (PWB). 
He trained at the Office of War 
Information (OWI), a US government 
information agency, which used 
modern mass-propaganda methods to 
disseminate pacifist ideas. He was sent 
to Rabat (Morocco) aboard an American 
(naval cargo) Liberty Ship, which was 
delivering supplies to the Allied Forces 
during the Battle of the Atlantic. There, 
he worked as a correspondent and 
information director for Voice of America 
radio, developing a round-the-clock 
programme of world news broadcasts. 
In 1944, he wrote in his diary: “I can’t tell 
you how much I love this work, I find it 
useful and feel it’s worth it.”
Sandy was then sent to Italy, where he 
set up a newsletter to inform people of 
the advance of the Allies and to promote 
peace. It was called Corriere di Roma, 
Corriere di Venezia, Corriere Veneto, or 
Corriere dell’Emilia (Bologna), depending 
on which liberated city or region it was 
published from.
The Courier is born
At the end of the Second World War, 
Sandy returned to France and became 
interested in this new international 
organization which aimed to foster 
peace through science and culture in 
a traumatized world, and which was 
causing a stir in intellectual circles all over 
the world – UNESCO. Its headquarters 
were in Paris, at the Hôtel Majestic, 19 
avenue Kléber.  
The Organization published a two-page 
monthly black-and-white broadsheet, The 
Monitor, in English, French and Spanish. 
The young journalist and columnist 
offered his services and started work on 
26 October, 1947, days after he turned 31.
It was no later than 19 November the 
same year, that he submitted a proposal 
for a journal – with its editorial line and 
periodicity, an outline of its different 
sections, the number of columns on 
a page, the length of the articles, the 
typeface – to Harold Kaplan, the first 
Director of UNESCO’s Bureau of Public 
Information. In short, a complete project, 
which was to become yet another 
“Corriere” – that of UNESCO. 
“The work of UNESCO is so varied, its 
programme includes such a vast number 
of vitally important subjects in all the 
fields of education, science and culture, 
that it should be no difficulty at all to 
gather lively, interesting articles,” he 
wrote. Ambitiously, he did not want to 
limit the journal’s content to UNESCO’s 
actions alone, but to offer readers 
a review of the international press, 
interviews with leading figures from the 
Organization and the worlds of culture 
and science, and in-depth articles written 
by experts from all over the world.

The UNESCO Courier is 70!70
70   |   The UNESCO Courier • October-December 2018
He suggested employing qualified editors 
for the French and Spanish editions, so 
that they would not just be simple replicas 
and the poor relations of the English 
edition. He undertook to “make sure that 
the journal meets the high standards for it 
to be sold to the general public”. 
Sandy succeeded on all fronts, in record 
time. The first issue of the UNESCO Courier, 
an illustrated journal with eight well-filled 
pages, rolled off the presses of the New 
York Herald Tribune in Paris, in February 
1948. A six-monthly subscription was 
offered to an international readership 
through agents in fifteen countries in 
Europe, Asia and America. One of the 
world’s first international journals was born. 
The Courier proliferates
In 1957, the Courier confirmed its 
international reach with the appearance of 
its first “field” issue, published in Moscow. 
The path was clear for other countries 
to follow. In 1960, a German edition was 
started in Bern (Switzerland). In 1961, 
an Arabic edition was launched in Cairo 
(Egypt) and a Japanese edition in Tokyo. In 
1963, an Italian edition followed, in Rome. 
In 1967, two editions, in Hindi and Tamil, 
were launched in India. Between 1968 and 
1973, editions in Hebrew, Persian, Dutch, 
Portuguese and Turkish were added. When 
Sandy retired in February 1977, the Courier 
was being published in fifteen languages. 
In 1988, the magazine’s editions 
reached an all-time high, appearing in 
thirty-five languages. 
For Sandy, multiplying the number of 
language versions of the Courier was a 
way of building bridges between people. 
This is what he said in Madras (now 
Chennai), India, at the launch of the Tamil 
edition: “In the past, nations were self-
centred. In the past twenty years, we have 
witnessed an astounding phenomenon 
of countries looking far beyond all 
borders to the horizons, to every corner 
of the globe, to work together for 
peace and understanding. This is the 
message that UNESCO and all the United 
Nations family is trying to achieve. This 
afternoon, I had the privilege to see the 
Chief Minister [of Tamil Nadu state]. He 
informed me that Madras is prepared to 
go ahead and has given us the green light 
for the production of a Tamil edition of 
the Courier. As the Editor-in-Chief of the 
Courier, my blood tingled when he said 
that, because this is an achievement.” 
On Sandy’s loyalty
Sandy Koffler was indisputably a 
great professional, gifted with solid 
interpersonal skills. A close friend of 
leading figures who have marked the 
twentieth century – such as the Swiss 
ethnologist Alfred Métraux and the 
American engineer and painter, Frank 
Malina, both colleagues at UNESCO – he 
was much appreciated by the first seven 
directors-general of the Organization. 
One of them, René Maheu (1961-1974) 
would say of him that his “talent was 
never separated from his convictions”.
Determined and charismatic, a tireless 
worker in the service of UNESCO’s ideals 
of peace, always watchful to remain 
politically neutral – even as international 
tensions mounted during the Cold War – 
Sandy Koffler had an inflexible character. 
“He never accepted orders, even from 
the highest diplomatic and political 
American officials; he was intransigent, 
and unshakeable and that posed some 
problems for him,” said Pauline Koffler, 
his second wife.
A citizen of the world
In a UNESCO administrative document 
dated 1959, I read about Sandy that his 
“professional competence, his technical 
qualities, his creative faculties, his 
initiative and his imagination make him a 
journalist and chief editor of exceptional 
calibre. He possesses an acute sense of 
responsibility, a profound professional 
conscience, undeniable qualities as 
organizer and leader, and the necessary 
capacity to be a director”. 
Another, much less formal, archive 
document, which is neither dated 
nor signed, reveals another aspect of 
Sandy’s character: “It is true that Sandy’s 
loyalty towards UNESCO, the United 
Nations and their ideals was obvious 
and unshakeable. I remember that every 
year three colleagues – Émile Delavenay, 
Thor Gjesdal and Sandy Koffler – who 
were rarely seen together in town, got 
together on 24 October, around midday, 
in a Parisian restaurant to celebrate their 
respective birthdays as well as, in a special 
toast, the anniversary of the entry into 
force of the Charter of the United Nations.”
For my part, I have always admired 
my grandfather, his intelligence and 
his character. I am grateful to him for 
having passed on his attachment to 
humanist values, his love of books and his 
fascination for cultures of the entire world.
Delving into his personal and professional 
archives has made me want to recount, 
in a documentary that I am working on 
at the moment, the enthralling story of 
this American who loved France and who 
always told me: “I am above all, a citizen 
of the world”.

The Courier in 
thirty-five languages!
You should have seen the wave 
of happiness that lit up Édouard's 
face the day he learned that the 
UNESCO Courier, of which he was 
editor‑in‑chief at the time, would be 
published in yet another language! 
You should have seen that wave 
of joy on his face, heard it vibrate 
in his voice: "Thirty‑five different 
languages, can you imagine!" Only 
then could you understand, not only 
how important the ideals defended 
by the Organization were to him, but 
also the decisive role this magazine 
– which he so passionately directed 
from 1982 to 1988 – played in the 
evolution of his thought and work.
