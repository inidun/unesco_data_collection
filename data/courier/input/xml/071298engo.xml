A CHALLENGE TO HUMANITY

Pictured on this page are some of the 40, 000 Palestinerefugee children attending emergency schools
set up originally by Unesco in co-operation with
voluntary aid organizations. The work of providing
educational assistance for these children began two
years ago and was maintained through the generosity
of organizations and men and women of goodwill in
many parts of the world.
Help of this sort for the Palestine refugees is essentially
part of a peace endeavour of the United Nations, which
acted as mediator in the Middle East and also saved
hundreds of thousands from starvation. Today, the
United Nations continues to help the refugees through
its relief and works agency (UNRWA) which is putting
into effect a rehabilitation programme aimed at making
them self-supporting.
Unesco is working with UNRWA to continue the exist-
ing educational programme and extend it to more of the
200, 000 Palestine refugee children. On their behalf,
tut has asked a question of the world-"Are these chit-
dren to be condemned to ignorance, idleness and
the subservience that accompanies illiteracy ?".
Unesco is confidant of a re-assuring answer.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 2 FEBRUARY 195 I
- Thanks To Unesco's Desert Schools
..
40, 000 MIDDLE EAST REFUGEE
CHILDREN HAVE CLAIMED HEIR RIGHT
to EDUCATION---.----'
ON a road that stretches across
the Sinai desert, there lies a
small town called K h a n
Younes (Jonah's Inn). Once it
was a busy centre of Arab Pales-
tine's border life, the first stop for
motorists travelling from Egypt to
Palestine. But, just over two years
ago, war flowed and ebbed over
Khan Younes ; and only now has
the town, at present in Egyptian-
occupied territory, returned to
normal life.
Some of its citizens have been
able to resume an almost normal
existence. But many thousands
of men and women are still suffer-
ing from the tragic effects of
war. And the visitor who comes to
Khan Younes for the first time, is
struck by most pathetic sights.
Scores of tents pitched in the
desert sand shelter refugees and
their families. A short distance
from these rather primitive living
quarters are a dozen isolated tents
which are used for several hours
each day as schools for a few
hundred refugee children, who,
forgetting their misfortunes, crowd
into the tents to receive an elemen-
tary school education.
Of the children attentively fol-
lowing the lessons, some are seated
on small, narrow benches ; others
stand or squat on the ground. The
teachers, using empty UNICEF milk
cases as desks and large stones as
chairs, go to endless pains to make
their pupils understand the ele-
ments of reading and writing.
An Image Comes Alive
IN one tent, the children arelearning to recite and chant
the Koran. A few steps away,
a group of boys are learning to
count on their fingers. Nearby, a
small crowd of children are gather-
ed at the entrance to a large
tent. One by one the children
enter and as each walks in, he is
given a tin cup full of milk. Then
he takes his seat alongside mothers
feeding their babies. Plates of
porridge and malted rice are
handed round. This is the midday
meal-an extra ration provided
by UMCEF.
At Nuseirat, these Arab boys are building their own school out of mud bricks.
Raw materials-water, sand and sun-are plentiful and the work goes with a
swing for the boys'enthusiasm is boundless.
Such sights as these greeted
Jaime Torres Bodet when he visited
the Arab refugee children in the
Gaza area early last month. The
Director-General of Unesco was
accompanied by Mohamed Shafik
Ghorbal Bey, Under-Secretary of
State, Egyptian Ministry of Educa-
tion, and a member of Unesco's
Executive Board, as well as by Sir
John Maud, Under-Secretary of

tion and former chairman of Unes-
co's Executive Board. They had
flown from Cairo to El Arish,
across the Suez Canal and motored
down to Gaza.
Khan Younes was their first
stop. The tent schools that Unesco
had helped set up in the desert
for Arab refugee children had
until then been only an image in
their minds. Now, however, the
picture had come to life. Khan
Younes shows what a tent school
means ; shows that although the
most essential school equipment
has now been provided, there is
still much to do.
Schoolboy Builders
WHEN M. Torres Bodet, Ghor-
bal Bey and Sir John Maud
reached the tent schools of
Nuseirat, a few miles away in the
vicinity of Gaza, they saw that
further progress had been achiev-
ed. Children looked healthier and
better clad, vocational training had
been started ; and though some
classes were still under tents, the
children had at least the comfort-
ing sight of more permanent
quarters rising nearby.
Only the outside walls of the
building have been completed, but
the rest will soon be ready. This
the children know, for they are
building the schools with their own
hands, out of bricks made with the
raw materials-mainly water, sand
and sun-found on the spot. The
work is easy ; the enthusiasm
boundless.
Sports have greatly helped in
raising the morale and the hopes
for the future of these children.
Between classes, they have a
vast playground-the desert. But
when the school bell-sometimes
a present from a faraway school
in England or France-is heard,
they return as eagerly to their
tents.
In Gaza itself, the children are
housed in proper schools untouched
by the fighting. They have expe-
rienced teachers and secondary
education is available to them.
Vocational training is given in two
large sheds where scores of boys
begin training as binders, carpen-
ters and weavers.

Chief Asset-Enthusiasm
-UNESCO'S work of educational
assistance for Arab refugee
children began early in 1949
when schools were set up in a few
camps. By December 31st, 1950,
over forty thousand were attending
Unesco schools. Of 24, 500 pupils
in the Gaza area, representing 43
per cent of refugee children in this
zone, twenty thousand go to
Unesco schools, 1, 200 to Egyptian
Government schools and 3, 300 to
private schools. They are looked
after by 409 teachers-all of them
refugees. Some have been trained
in teachers'colleges and have also
acquired experience in the schools
set up in Palestine under the Bri-
tish mandate.
In the Unesco schools, the chil-
dren learn reading and writing in
Arabic and arithmetic and in most
cases, elementary history and geo-
graphy and sometimes agriculture
are taught.
Most of the Unesco schools had
to be set up with makeshift means
in tents or in the open air. A
serious handicap in the early
stages was the absence of seats,
tables, chairs, blackboards, exercise
books, pencils and textbooks. And
today there are still refugee
"schools"where these essentials
are lacking and where the chief
working asset is the enthusiasm of
the teachers.
The understandable desire of
the refugee population to give
their children education, ele-
mentary though it be ; the per-
sistent efforts of voluntary organi-
zatioI1s to give the refugees some-
thing more enduring than the bare
means of subsistence ; and lastly,
the work of Unesco, which has
championed throughout the world
the rights of refugee children to
education-all these factors have
combined to bring about a steady
increase in the number of schools
and their attendance.
The educational assistance pro-
gramme is now operated jointly by
Unesco and the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA). The latter organiza-
tion is responsible for administra-
tive questions and is bearing a
major part of the financial burden.
A tremendous amount of work
still lies ahead. There is still in-
sufficient school equipment. Ac-
cordingly, the General Conference
of Unesco last year renewed its
appeal to the United Nations, go-
vernments of Member States,
National Commissions and private
organizations, for generous assis-
tance so that the education of
these children might be carried on.
There is every reason to hope
that the programme of educational
assistance for refugee children in
the Middle East-inspired by the
right of those children to educa-
tion, initiated with the help of so
many organizations and carried
out in a most constructive spirit
of collaboration-can be conti-
nued until the problem of the Pa-
lestinian refugees is finally olved.

UNITING FOB PEACE : The Bole Of The
United Nations General
Assembly In Preserving
Peae And Security
O N November 3, 1950, the General Assembly of the United Nations adoptedby 52-5, with two abstentions, an important resolution. Its purpose
was to reinforce the Charter's measures for collective security and to
accelerate the social and economic progress of the world. On such founda-
tions alone could an enduring peace be built. The resolution reaffirmed that
only by a constant application of the Charter's Principles, could the high aims
of the United Nations, as stated in the First Article of the Charter, be ful-
filled.
To this end, faced with a threat to peace or a breach of peace by an act
of aggression, and in cases where the Security Council fails to discharge its
responsibilities, the General Assembly, in which all the United Nations have
equal representation, may meet in emergency special session within twenty-
four hours and make recommendations to Member States on necessary collec-
tive measures, including the authorisation of armed force.
With the object of facilitating the task of the Assembly and the Security
Council, two new agencies were established and put at their disposal : (1) a
Peace Observation Commission consisting of 14 members, including the five
permanent members of the Security Council. The appointment of this Com-
mission was approved by 57 votes to nil, two abstaining. (2) A Collective
Measures Committee to investigate methods which might be used to main-
tain and strengthen international peace or security in accordance with the.
Purposes and Principles of the Charter.
The resolution also recommended that each Member State should inves-
tigate the full extent of its country's resources to determine the nature and
scope of the assistance it might be in a position to render in support of any
recommendations of the Security Council or of the General Assembly for
the restoration of international peace or security.
Fully conscious of the futility of adopting further measures of collective
security without reinforcing the fundamental condition to peace, the General
Assembly, in a 54 vote to nil, with one abstention, urged Member States.'to
develop and stimulate universal respect for and observance of human rights
and fundamental freedoms and to intensify individual and collective efforts
to achieve conditions of economic stability and social progress, particularly
through the development of under-developed countries and areas."
--. areas :'
RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY
ON NOVEMBER 3, 1950
The General nib'",
RECOGNIZING that the first two stated Purposes of the
United Nations are :
"To maintain international peace and security, and to that
end : to take effective collective measures for h prevention
and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression
of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to
bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the
principles of justice and international law, adjustment or
settlement of international disputes or situations which might
lead to a breach of the peace", and
"To develop friendly relations among nations based on
respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination
of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to
strengthen universal peace",
REAFFIRMING that it re-
mains the primary duty of
all Members of the United
Nations, when involved in an
international dispute, to seek
settlement of such a dispute
by peaceful means through the
procedures laid down in
Chapter VI of the Charter,
and recalling the successful
achievements of the United
Nations In this regard on a
number of previous occasions,
FINDING that internatibnal
tension exists on a dangerous
scale,
RECALLING its resolution
290 (IV) entitled"Essentials
of peace", which states that
disregard of the Principles of
the Charter of the Nations is
primarily responsible for the
continuance of international
tension, and desiring to contri-
bute further to the objectives
of that resolution,
REAFFIRMING the impor-
tance of the exercise by the
Security Council of its primary
responsibility for the mainte-
nance of international peace
and security, and the duty of
the permanent members to
seek unanimity and to exercise
restraint in the use of veto,
REAFFIRMING that the
initiative in negotiating the
agreements for armed forces
provided for in Article 45 of
the Charter belongs to the
Security Council, and desiring
to ensure that, pending the
conclusion of such agreements,
the United Nations has at its
disposal means for maintain-
ing international peace and
security,
CONSCIOUS that failure of
the Security Council to dis-
charge its responsibilities on
behalf of all the Member
States, particularly those res-
ponsibilities referred to in the
two preceding paragraphs,
does not relieve Member States
of their obligations or the
United Nations of its respon-
sibility under the Charter to
maintain international peace
and security,
RECOGNIZING in parti-
cular that such failure does
not deprive the General
Assembly of its rights or
relieve it of its responsibilities
under the Charter in regard
to the maintenance of inter-
national peace and security,
RECOGNIZING that dis-
charge by the General
Assembly of its responsibilities
in these respects calls for pos-
sibilities of observation which
would ascertain the facts and
expose aggressors ; for the
existence of armed forces
which could be used collec-
tively ; and for the possibility
of timely recommendation by
the General Assembly to
Members of the United Nations
for collective action which, to
be effective, should be prompt.
A
1. RESOLVES that if the
Security Council, because of
lack of unanimity of the per-
manent members, fails to
exercise its primary respon-
sibility for the maintenance of
international peace and se-
curity in any case where
there appeals to be a threat to
peace, breach of the peace, or
act of aggression, the General
Assembly shall consider the
matter immediately with a
view to making appropriate
recommendations to Members
for collective measures, inclu-
ding in the/Case of a breach
of the peace or act of aggres-
sion the use of armed force
when necessary, to maintain
or restore international peace
and security. If not in session
at the time, the General
Assembly may meet in emer-
gency special session within
twenty-four hours of the
request therefor. Such emer-
gency special session shall be
called if requested by the
Security Council on the vote
of any seven members, or by
a majority of the Members of
the United Nations ;
2. ADOPTS for this purpose
the amendments to its rules of
procedure set forth in the
annex to the present reso-
lution ;

Israel, New Zealand, Pakistan,
Sweden, the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, the United
States of America and Uru-
guay, and which could observe
and report on the situation in
any area where there exists
international tension the
continuance of which is likely
to endanger the maintenance
of international peace and
security. Upon the invitation
or with the consent of the
State into whose territory
the Commission would go, the
General Assembly, or the
Interim Committee when the
Assembly is not in session, may
utilize the Commission if the
Security Council is not exer-
cising the functions assigned
to it by the Charter with res-
pect to the matter in question.

conscious that enduring peace
will not be secured solely by
collective security arrange-

UNESCO COURIER-Pag-4 FEBRUARY 1951
THE decision that Unesco should select collective security as amajor theme in its educational work. in the light of the action
taken by the United Nations with respect to Korea, was made
by the Executive Board of Unesco in September, last year.
As part of a general resolution adopted by the Board on Unesco's
contribution to the action of the United Nations and Specialized
Agencies in the Korean crisis, the Director-General was authorized
to undertake a special programme of education on the principles of
collective security and their application in such specific circums-
tances as the conflict in Korea.
Accordingly, plans were made for the production of written and
visual materials for use at various levels of education.
Publications already written or in the course of preparation under
these plans include pamphlets explaining collective security, address-
ed to teachers, senior pupils, and adult groups ; pamphlets of sug-
gestions for teachers ; studies on collective security intended pri-
marily for use in universities ; and wall charts for use in classrooms.
On this page and on pages 5 and 6, the Courier presents a"pre-
view"of these publications, in the form of extracts from one of the
pamphlets intended for the use of teachers, senior pupils in secon-
dary schools and adult education classes, an article written by one
of the authors of the three studies directed to"university level"
audiences, and an article explaining the purposes to be served by
the wall charts now being prepared by the Bureau of Current Affairs
in London.
As an aid to teaching about collective security in secondary schools andadult education classes, three pamphlets for teachers are being produ-
ced by Unesco. In brief form (approximately 40 pages), they sketch the prin-
ciples, problems and historical developments of international collective security.
To write these pamphlets in English, French and Spanish respectively, Unesco
has called upon Dr. A. Appadorai, Secretary-General of the Indian Council of World
Affairs ; M. Jean Dupuy, an authority on international law ; and Professor Guillermo
Francovich, Rector of the University of San Francisco Xavier, Sucre, Bolivia.
These three authors have written independently, each in a different language,
on common lines agreed upon in a series of consultations. The three pamphlets,
to be published in Unesco's"Towards World Understanding"series, will be
available for free distribution.
Below we publish extracts from the pamphlet prepared by Dr. Appadorai,
who was formerly professor of politics at the University of Madras. Dr.
Appadorai is the author of Substance of Politics (Oxford University Press,
1949) and of several pamphlets on international affairs.
THE MEANING OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY
Security and Freedom
HISTORY is in large measure a
record of man's efforts to
achieve greater security and
freedom. The gradual evolution of
the modern state from tribal
beginnings obscured by time is a
pattern of attempts to achieve
these things. At the outset, men
grouped themselves together main-
ly for mutual protection ; in due
course, nations came into being
and political institutions advanced
towards the ideal of government
by consent. The search for secu-
rity led to nationalism ; for
freedom, to democracy.
Since the Industrial Revolution,
the different nations have become
economically more interdependent ;
teehnology has increased their
capacity for production and des-
truction as well ; iand war, with
the aid, of science, has come to
mean total annihilation. It has
become clear that there must be
a rule of law among nations as
there is a rule of law among
individuals within each state. The
attempts to establish such a rule
of law represent a continuance and
extension of man's efforts to
achieve security and freedom.
The implications of a rule of law
among nations can be fully grasp-
end only by contrast with the
rule of might which still prevails.
At present, when'a nation's
interests are supposed to conflict
with those of another, the nation
concerned may resort to war as an
instrument of policy. Each state
has therefore had to try indivi-
duaYy or through alliances to be
stronger than its adversaries. But
the world wars of 1914-18 and 1939-
45 have taught a painful lesson :
security based solely on might is
impossible for all at the same time,
or even for a few at all times.
This indeed is inherent in the
logic of facts. Every state or
group of states cannot be always
stronger than every other state or
group of states.
What then is the alternative ? The
answer 4s collective security
through the rule. of law. This
means three things :
1. Nations must agree to the
principle that in matters affect-
ing other nations besides their own
they will accept the rule of conduct
iaiddown by C6 common inter-
national authority as binding on
themselves.
2. They must agree to renounce
the right to settle disputes by
making tear.
3. They must bind themselves to
regard any act of war by any State
in breach of this primary obligation
as an'act of war against them-
selves and come to the assistance
of the victim of the agression.
One means of establishing in-
ternational collective security
through the rule of law is the
voluntary acceptance of the prin-
ciple as symbolized in a league of
sovereign nations. This is not a
new idea ; indeed, it can be traced
back at least as far as the four-
teenth century. However, the
most significant attempts to orga-
nize such a league on the world
scale have occurred within our
own times.
Dr. Appadorai goes on to discuss
the development of the idea of
collective security in the life-time
of the League of Nations, before
writing on the subject of the
LESSONS ON THE UNITED NATIONS are being introduced in schools all over the world
with the help of teaching methods worked out by Unesco. Here a class 01 ten-year-aids listens
and looks as their teacher shows a film-strip produced by the United Nations.
United Nations and Collective Se-
curity. In.'this, the third and
longest chapter, he deals with the
purposes and principles of the
United Nations, the organization
of collective security, the record of
the U. N.'s work, the Korean crisis
and finally outlines some of the
efforts that have been made to
reduce poverty, disease, and econo-
mic inequality-which in the ulti-
mate analysis are responsible for
frustration, insecurity, discontent,
dispute and war.
In the last chapter of the
pamphlet, extracts from which are
reprinted here, Dr. Appadorai
suggests ways by which the found-
ations of collective security could be
strengthened.
STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATIONS
DiHiculties and Weaknesses
history of the last five
t years, and more especially theKorean crisis, has brought
into relief some difficulties and
weaknesses in the present organi-
zation of collective security. The
fear of war, instead of receding,
has increased. Nations are spend-
ing on armaments the money
and the energy which they should
spend on economic development
and the provision of social services.
Confidence in the ability of the
United Nations to provide security,
it is clean, has not yet been
created.
The consequence of such a poli-
tical climate on the system of
collective security provided in the
Charter has been disastrous. Ar-
ticles 43, 45, 46 and 47 of the
Charter are fundamental to that
system. According to these, the
Security Council was, with the
assistance of the Military Staff
Committee, to negociate with
Member Nations agreements for
making available to it at its call,
armed forces, assistance and faci-
lities necessary for the purpose of
maintaining international peace
and security. But on account of
the political differences referred
to earlier, and mutual suspicion,
the Military Staff Committee could
not function, and no agreements
with Member Nations could be
worked out.
Article 27, paragraph 3, which
contained the famous principle of
unanimity-that decisions of the
Security Council on matters other
than procedural"shall be made by
an affirmative vote of seven mem-
bers, including the concurring
votes of the permanent members"
(with certain exceptions in respect
of the pacific settlement of dis-
SUGGESTIONS FOR TEACHERS
putes)-has been found to be a
limiting factor. In defence of the
veto, it must be said that it was
included in the Charter because
continuing unanimity of purpose
among the Big Five was the very
foundation of the Organization.
Any other course was too acad-
emic : if the Big Five split, the Or-
ganization would be divided in
any case and the members would
act as they liked. What was
necessary then was to maintain
the unity of the United Nations,
and to depend on that unity to
lay the foundations of a lasting
peace.
But as it was, the existence of
the veto not only prevented the
proper building up of a system of
collective security ; it also prevent-
ed the Organization from becom-
ing las universal as it could be.
The admission of such nations as
Ceylon and Finland, for instance,
has been blocked by the veto, with
the result that as many as 14
nations are still outside the Orga-
nization.
It is not our purpose, here, to
examine the differences between
the factions or to judge who is
right and who is wrong. In the
context of collective security what
is significant is the inability of the
Security Council to act effectively ;
each party accuses the other of
expansionist ambitions, and there
is mutual suspicion. But as against
this, the people of the world are
anxious to avoid war and, if we
read public opinion aright, they
would like to see the United
Nations established more effective-
ly as an instrument for collective
security.
Improvement
of the Machinery
T. HREE pamphlets of practical suggestions on teaching about
collective securitiy to pupils in the 11-16 age range dre to be
published by Unesco. They will be complementary to the
pamphlets described above and, like them, will be'f !"epm>ed
independently but on similar lines by three authorittes from
different couJl, tries, each writing in his own language. The authors
of the pamphlets of suggestions and the languages in which they
will write are : Mr. John Spencer, of Harrogate Training College,
England (english) ; M. Plful Fraud, Primary School Inspector,
Paris (French) ; and Sr. Dlego Gonzalez, SuperintC11dent of Schools,
Havana, Cuba (Spanish).
HOW then can this be done ?ri We must at this stage
go back to first principles.
Power held in reserve has always
played an important part in inter-
national politics ; the United Na-
tions can be an effective instru-
ment of collective security only if
the statesmen of the powerful
nations are prepared to use the
power of their States on its behalf.
Granted this, how can the ma-
chinery be improved ?

ORGANIZING FOR PEACE
. A"PR06RESS REPORT"
To prepare studies on the subject of collective security directedprimarily to an audience at the college and university level, Unesco
commissioned three distinguished authorities from different
countries.
These three authors were : Dr. Andrew Martin, international lawyer
and lecturer at Ruskin College, Oxford (English text) ; Professor Georges
Scelle, professor of international law, University of Paris, and Secretary-
General of the Academy of International Law at the Hague (French text) ;
and H. E. Antonio Castro Leal, Head of the Mexican Delegation to
Unesco (Spanish text).
The three authors discussed the work and agreed on a general plan
as a basis for the texts, but each is writing in his own language with a
maximum freedom of expression and interpretation.
In the following article, written specially for the Courier, Dr. Andrew
Martin explains why he is casting his version of the Unesco monograph
in the form of a.. progress report".
IT is a somewhat perilous adventure
to write aboul collective security at
a moment of challenge and crisis ;
the writer is in constant danger of being
overtaken, by kaleidoscopic changes in
the situation, and of losing his perspec-
tive. Yet, from the point of view of
education in world citizenship the op-
portunity is unique.
Since 1919, most of the universities
have treated the problems of security
as fit only for the advanced student
specializing in international law or the
history of international institutions.
Now, all of a sudden, the subject has
become full of life, one which trans-
cends the traditional ljnes of demarca-
tion between the faculties, and by sheer
force of circumstance, is pushed right
into the focus of the attention of all
young people whatever may be their
particular line of study.
It is the common experience of many
teachers that the average student has
a preconceived attitude to collective se-
curity. There are, first or all, the"idea-
lists"who have unbounded respect for
the printed word of international ins-
truments, point with confidence to the
text of their Charter and say in effect :
"Collective security is an accomplished
fact. The machinery is streamlined
and automatic. It is bound to work
once it is properly run in."
There are, on the other hand, the
"realists", animated by an unconcealed
mistrust of international wars since
1945. For them, the Charter is a hollow
pretence and collective security in an
unfederated community of States a
mere figment of the imagination.
It these attitudes are, as I believe
'them to be, typical, there is a strong
. case for providing two propositions :
firstly, that in the past fifty years we
have made considerable and at times
revolutionary progress towards a work-
ing organization for peace ; secondly,

that if we want to cover the distance
which still separates us from the target,
the essential requirements of the. sys-,
tern must be understood and actively
supported by far wider sections of pub-.
lie opinion than is at present the case.
In keeping with this conception of
collective security as an organization
still in the process of evolution, I have
cast my own version of the textbook.
commissioned by Unesco in the form of
a"progress report".
Security is the sum total of interna-
tional activity in three interdependent
fields : regulation of armaments, pacif-
ic settlement of disputes, collective
action against breaches of the peace.
The evolution of ideas and institutions
in these three sectors has been neither
steady nor uniform. Progress in one
field has been frequently accompanied
by stagnation, indeed by retrogression
in one or both of the others. Yet, on
balance, there is a definite overall pro-
gress to record and I have attempted to
assess its nature and size.
To set in proper perspective the three
technical surveys which form the main
body of the book, I have tried to trace,
in an. introductory chapter, the funda-
mental change of our ideas about the'function of international society in rela-
tion to the. prevention of violence ; to
define the political impact of economic,
social and cultural co-operation within
the united Nations system ; and to
argue the case for a better appreciation
Of the moral and PSì'chological condi-
t ions of security.
IN the following article, Mr. WE. WiOiams, director ofthe Bureau of Current! Affairs, London, describes the special wall charts being produced for
Unesco by the Bureau of Current Affairs. The charts will provide a visual
presentation with a brief text, of (1) The United Nations, (2) the Security
Council and (3) Unesco. They are designed to provide a basis for a"United
Nations Corner"in schools and thus stimulate continuing activities and pro-
jects by both teachers and pupils :
MANY vital phrases in the vocab-ulary of the United Nations
make a rather vague impact on
the popular mind. One of these is
the phrase"Collective Security".
Unesco has recently undertaken an
educational campaign to bring home
to the Man-in-the-Street the signific-
ance of collective security ; One means
whereby this is to be attempted is
through a pair of wall charts designed
and produced by the Bureau of Current
Affairs in the United Kingdom. They
will be produced in four colours and
three languages, English, French and
Spanish, and will form a compact and
colourful unit suitable for display in
school classrooms, community centres,
youth clubs and factories.
This is not the first time, by any
means, that wall posters have been
designed for such purposes. But the
Bureau of Current Affairs claims some
valuable innovations in the posters
now in production. For one thing,
they will not merely rely on their first
impact upon those who look at them,
but because they will require periodic
alteration and revision, they should
prove of constant interest to groups of
children and adults wherever they are
displayed.
It is particularly hoped, during the
anxious period in which we now live,
to keep alive a vital interest in collect-
ive security and to help people to
understand its interpretation in the
deliberations of U. N.
The two charts should be displayed
side by side. The first is a visual
interpretation of U. N. : the countries
which belong, their interdependence,
able victories over ignorance, disease
and malnutrition.
On the reverse of the second chart.
therefore, will appear, in the first
issue, a depiction of the specific tasks
of Unesco. Subsequent issues will deal
similarly with the achievements of
such organizations as the Food and
Agriculture Organization, the World
Health Organization and the Inter-
national Labour Organization.
The material on Chart I will be of
a comparatively permanent character.
But Chart II, and the reverse of
Chart II, afford obvious opportunities
for revised versions of the material

and the consequences, in human and
industrial terms, of warfare. The
second chart is devoted entirely to the
Security Council, its compostion, terms
of reference, achievements to date and
future problems.
TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE
PEACE is not simply the avoidanceof war, and it has b en thought
well to embody on these charts
some reminder of what is being done
by the various specialist agencies of
U. N. to consolidate peace by compar-
they contain in their initial present-
ation.
These charts are not intended
merely for display on a wall where, in
due course, their message will be
taken as read or totally ignored.
They are expressly planned to stimul-
ate a regular and consistent interest
in international affairs. Each of them
is 40"X 30"in size, and they are design-
ed to appear beside each other. In the
leaflet of instructions which will go out
with the charts, teachers are urged to
locate this unit in a strategic position
in the school-in the main hall, for
example, or in a corridor where the
children often gather.
TAPING THE : VIEWS
A MONO numerous suggestions formaking the chart  a focus f
interest, there is room here to
mention only one. This is the device
called"Taping the News". To carry
this out, a long table should be placed
against the wall underneath the
charts, and children should be en-
couraged to collect newspaper cuttings
and photographs about the U. N. and
Security Council and pin them on the
table. These cuttings should then be
joined to the appropriate places on.
the maps and diagrams by coloured
tapes, a practice which not only tends
to give a bright and dramatic aspect
to the unit, but also teaches children
to put two and two together in their
observation of what is taking place in
the world.
The Bureau of Current Affairs has
a long experience in creating pictorial
conceptions of this kind, but all who
have seen these charts and drafts are
impressed not only by their attractive-
ness to the eye but by the skill with
which they convey their message.
Roughs of the material were recently
shown to meetings of TJ. N., and also
at Unesco, so a great deal of represen-
tative opinion and experience has been
embodied in the final results.
The plates have been made, and by
the time these words are read, the
copy of the English edition of the
charts should be coming off the
presses. The French and Spanish
editions will follow very shortly.

STRUGGLE FOR COLLECTIVE SECURITY

UNESCO COURIER-Page 6 FEBRUARY 195 I
STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATIONS
. OF COLLECTIVE SECURITY
(continued from p. 4)
The United Nations should have
reliable means of information on
preparations for aggression and on
aggression itself when it takes
place ; it must be capable of tak-
ing quick and effective action ; and
the action must be backed up by
power. The Assembly, according
to the Charter, can only make
recommendations ; it cannot take
binding action. Article II clearly
states that any such question (re-
lating to the maintenance of inter-
national peace and security) on
which action is necessary shall be
referred to the Security Council by
the General Assembly, either
before or after discussion. Much
has been made of this restriction
and it has been suggested that only
a general conference summoned
under Article 109 to review the
Charter could legally vest in the
Assembly such functions as were
proposed to be transferred to it,
under'a united action for peace'
resolution which was introduced in
the Political Committee by seven
nations on 9 October, 1950.
Here, Dr. Appadorai outlines the
points covered by the"united
action for peace"resolution, the
text of which is published on page 3
of this issue. He then goes on :
Is this a usurpation by the As-
sembly of a power conferred by the
Charter on the Security Council ?
We think not. First, the Assembly
has been given some responsibility
for the maintenance of internatio-
nal peace. Secondly, this is only
a recommendation and, clearly, the
Assembly can recommend. A re-
commendation has, of course, no
binding force as, for instance, a
decision by the Security Council
would have ; that means that the
effectiveness of the resolution
depends upon how far Member
States are prepared to co-operate
with the Assembly in checking
aggression.
Perhaps another point may be
made clear. It is difficult under
the Charter to think of a United
Nations sponsored war against a
permanent member of the Security
Council if any one of them is an
aggressor, since each has a veto in
the Security Council in respect of
preventive or enforcement action ;
and an Assembly resolution cannot
substantially alter the fundamen-
tal position of the Big Five under
the Charter.
From the point of improved
machinery for collective security,
it is worthwhile also to explore the
possibility of regional arrange-
ments (contemplated under Arti-
cles 52-54 of the Charter) for co-
operation between countries and
with the United Nations ; they
may be useful for localising con-
flicts and ensuring peace, if pro-
perly set up and organized. A
small expert committee, it is
suggested, may be established to
study the problem in all its aspects.
Aid to Under-
developed Countries
MENTION has been made earlierof the importance of the
economic development of
under-developed countries ; the
"United Action for peace resolu-
tion"passed by the Assembly on
3 November 1950 specifically urged
Member States to intensify indi-
vidual and collective efforts to
achieve conditions of economic
stability and social progress parti-
cularly through the development
of under-developed countries and
- THE UNESCO STORY"
PUBLISHED IN U. S.
A graphic record of the great andwide-spread interest in h  United
States in the activities of Unesco
is provided in an illustrated 112-page
booklet, titled"The Unesco Story",
which has just been published by
the United States National Commis-
sion for Unesco. The booklet des-
cribes the into, national programmes
01 Unesco and the work of national
organizations and community groups
in the United States in furthering
understanding of the Organization's
aims and activities.
areas. There is no space here to
discuss the ways and means for
such development ; it is sufficient
to draw attention to the Report of
the Fourth Session of the Sub-
Commissinn on Economic Develop-
ment. Under-developed areas need
for their economic development
capital equipment and financing as
well as technical assistance ; and
in both these respects, the methods
which have been tried and found
suitable in the industrialized coun-
tries of the West must be conside-
rably modified to meet the needs
of the under-developed countries.
The Sub-Commission referred to
above recommended (regarding
financing) that international lend-
ing institutions follow flexible
policies in making external loans
for local currency costs of economic
development, with due regard to
the circumstances in each case
and with a view always to the basic
objectives to be achieved ; the
Chairman of the Commission
suggested a bold new organization
under the aegis of the United
Nations to promote the economic
development of the under-develop-
ed countries..'The new organ",
he said,"would work. in co-
operation with the International
Bank and other'Prgans of the
United Nations, but it would be
charged with responsibility for
economic development. It should
not be merely a planning or advi-
sory organ but should have finance
at its disposal"..
Regarding technical assistance,
and assistance to economic deve-
lopment in general, the United
Nations has now recognised the
wholesome principle that"it must
be organically related to the eco-
nomy"of the country which asks
for the assistance. Besides,"the
services rendered by the United
Nations must be of the kind desired
by the government of the request-
ing cou' (l, try. They must be dests'n-
ed to meet its needs, must be
in the form that it desires and
must be designed to strengthen its
national economy and promote its
political and economic indepen-
dence. Such principles preclude
the arbitrary imposition of schemes
devised by foreigners to achieve
the political or economic subju-
gatiowor exploitation of peoples of
less highly developed countries.".
The more help rendered to
under-developed countries on the
principles stated above, the better
the chances for providing the con-
ditions under which collective secu-
rity can be maintained.
The Creation
of Goodwill
FINALLY, to promote collectiveSecurity, the development of
certain national and indivi-
dual attitudes will be helpful.
At the national level, what is
important to realize is, that diffe-
rent ideologies, together with the
institutions they imply, must learn
to exist side by side in the world ;
for the one ideology to try to wipe
out the other is undesirable and
impracticable. In concrete terms
this means that the governments of
the countries concerned should
cease abusing social systems and
ideologies with which they are not
in sympathy. It also means the
removal of suspicioy by promot-
ing freer intercourse between the
countries.
At the individual level, the rele-
vant attitude to be cultivated
consists of two elements : (1) the
attitude of'live and let live', a
sense of tolerance and charity, a
recogfnition that a diversity of
cultures, by their very diversity,
contributes to the increase of
human happiness ; and (2) non-
violence, that is, the recognition
that the warlike attitude is not
something inherent in man, but,
instead, that man is by nature so-
cial and can live in neighbourly
friendliness and love. These
attitudes in the individual which
education can do much to culti-
vate, indeed go to the root of the
problem of collective security.

THE U. N. FIGHT AGAINST DISEASE AND DESPAIR IN KOREA
Two immense problems for the Unified Command in Korea-the protection of the civilian
population against epidemics and the care of refugees and orphans-are illustrated In these
photographs. To prevent oubreaks of sma ( (-pox, typhus, typhoid and cholera, mass inno-
culations have been carried out (above), (1) by Korean doctors under the supervision of the
Unified Command, which supplies the vaccines and medical equipment. Orphans found
wandering in the ruins of the Korean city (above), (2) are placed in a truck to be taken to
an orphanage by a U. N. Welfare Officer on the staff of the Unified Command.
EXECUTIVE BOARD APPROVES
USE OF $ 100. 000 FUND
FOR URGENT KOREAN
EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
ONE way in which Unesco responded to the United Nations appeal forsupport of its action in Korea last year, was to establish a special
fund for educational, scientific and cultural aid to the people of Korea.
Last month, after receiving details of Korea's"minimum, emergency'
educational requirements, Unesco's Executive Board decided to make an
immediate contribution towards the provision of the most urgent of these
supplies by offering this special fund of $100, 000 to the Secretary-Generalof United Nations.
The resolution approved by the Board authorized the Director-General
to put the fund at the disposal of the U. N. Secretary-General, when"h-8
shall have informed the Director-General that the situation in Korea
would permit the effective use of the fund for educational, scientific any
cultural aid to the civilian population of Korea".
The extensive list of educational supplies towards the provision of
which the fund may now be employed, was forwarded to Unesco by the UN
Secretary-General, Mr. Trygve Lie, from the Unified Command. It
included such items as newsprint, paper, blackboards, pencils and note-
books.
As accurate figures regarding the number of elementary school pupils,
classrooms and schools were not available, the items listed were based on
the needs of one million five hundred thousand pupils in approximately
4, 000 schools and represented"minimum emergency requirements".
As a result of the Executive Board's meeting, Unesco has asked
Mr. Trygve Lie to obtain information from the Unified Command as to
which items in the list have the highest priority.
Many voluntary agencies are anxious to co-operate in the relief and
rehabilitation of Korea. Unesco is therefore making every effort through
the machinery of the United Nations to secure information about specific
needs of universities and educational institutions there. Factual data and
background material of this kind are indispensable to these voluntary
aid organizations in launching fund raising appeals.

FEBRUARY 1951
REGIONAL CONFERENCE FOR
WESTERN HEMISPHERE SETS
NEW STANDARDS FOR WORK
OF NATIONAL COMMISSIONS
Page 7-UNESCO COURIER
we first Regional Conference ofnational Commissions of the
\Vestern Hemisphere, held, at
Havana in December, was conceived by
Unesco as an experiment which, if
successful, could provide it with a new,
precise and effective instrument for
action.
Last month M. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Unesco's Director-General, reporting to
the Organization's Executive Board on
the work of the Conference, was able
to state :.. Without prejudicing the
ultimate results of the Conference, it
may be said at once that it'lEas a very
great success. The final resolution
adopted by the Conference, whwh em-
phasises the value of the information
exchange and the impetus given to the
National Commissions of the ll ; estern
hemisphere, recommends that 1 draw
the attention of the General Conference
to these results, lvith a view to the
periodical convening of Regional Con-
ferences."
In all, 17 countries sent delegates to
the Conference. These were :
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El
Salvador, France, Guatemala. Haiti,
Honduras, Mexico, Panama. United
States nf America Hrusruav and Vene-
zueta. In addition, CMU,
Paraguay and Nicaragua,
which are not yet members
of Unesco, sent observers.
The First Lesson
tion and work of the National Commis-
sions ; dissemination of and teaching
about Human Rights ; Technical Assis-
tance programme in Latin America ;
Fundamental Education in Latin Ame-
rica and a special Unesco project ;
teaching about the United Nations ;
translation of great Latin American
books ; libraries and book coupons ; the
role of universities in the present day
world.
The conclusions the Conference drew
from its work and the practical solu-
tions it found for each point on its
agenda are reflected in the recommen-
dations which it made to Governments
and National Commissions.
(Some of the most important of these
appear on page ten of this issue.)
Education-Technical Aid
Q pEciAL attention was given to the ur-gent educational probl ms of La-
tin America to-day. Delegates, for
example, closely examined Unesco's
programme on Fundamental Education,
after M. Torres Bodet had described its
development, and outlined the work ac-
complished through missions seminars,
pilot projects and training and produc-
tion centres.
CUBA'S NATIONAL CAPITOL (above) where the naugural Conference meeting was held,
is one of Havana's finest building, A second meeting, devoted to the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, was held there on December 10. This building also housed the three Unesco
Exhibitions which were opened during the Conference.
IT was the compositionof the del gati ns, how-
ever, as well as their
number, that ensured the
success of the Conference.
These delegates included
Five Ministers of Educa-
tion, two Under-Secre-
taries of State, a former
President, and several
former Ministers, eigkt
Directors of Education,
and many officials from
ministries of Education
and Culture. The Orga-
nisation of American Sta-
tes was represented by its
Secretary-General and by
the Director of its Educa-
Lion Department. Mr. How-
land Sergeant, United
States Deputy Assistant
Secretarv of State for
PubJic Affairs was also
present, and gave a lecture
on a particularly important
Conference subject, Tech-
nical Assistance.
THE HAVANA CONFERENCE hears a talk on Technical Assistance
given by Mr Howland Sergeant, United States Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State for Public Affairs. This photo shows : (from left to right) Dr. Mendez
Pereira, Head of Unesco's Regional Office in Havana ; M. Michel Dard,
Head of Unesco's Division of Relations with Governments and National
Commissions ; M. Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-General ; Dr. Cosme
de la Torriente, Chairman of the Conference ; Mr. Howland Sergeant and
Dr. Vincente Ardaya, Bolivian Minister of Education.
The presence of such a high propor-
tion of responsible persons, who direct
the executive bodies of member states
in Unesco fields, was described by
M. Torres Bodet as perhaps the most
salient feature of the Conference.
Emphasizing this point in a report to
the Executive Board, he stated :"It
cannot be denied that, in many coun-
trie, ç, the relationship between the Exec-
utive and the delegations to the
General Conference still leaves much to
be desired. In cases where the execu-
tion of our annual programme falls to
authorities which have rwt themselves
taken part in the Conference discus-
sions, those authorities frequently have
little understanding for, or even no
kno/cledge at all, of that programme.
It is scarcely possible to remedy this
situation. It would be very difficuU to
persuade the responsible members of
the Executive to undertake journeys of
101 !-g duration to distant capitals. The
first lesson of the Havana regional
Conference therefore is that, if Unesco-
wishes to reach them, it must do so
on the spot."
Work Of Delegations
A T Havana, Unesco did effectivelyreach the Mi isters and Directors,
who took part in the four daily
work meetings throughout the Confe-
rence, and who were able to make a
personal study of Unesco's problems
and methods of work.
wishing to tackle problems together,
and to be kept informed on as wide a
regional basis as possible, of all mat-
ters under discussion, delegates reject-
ed the idea of adopting"division of
labour,"and of appointing a certain
number of delegates to each committee.
In eleven working days, delegates
were able to deal with questions whose
scope might normally have seemed ex-
cessive for the time available.
These questions included. organiza-
The Director-General also an-
nounced the opening in Patzcuaro,
Mexico of the first Regional Fund-
amental Education Centre for Latin
American countries. (See pages 8
and 9.)
This project for the training of per-
sonnel and the preparation of teaching
material for Fundamental Education
campaigns was strongly approved by
the delegates, who submitted a series of
suggestions for its development.
The Conference made a close study of
Technical Assistance methods and sug-
gested a number of ways for National
Commissions to collaborate in the im-
plementation of the United Nations
Technical Assistance p) an. These in-
cluded their participation in study
groups, the nomination of experts who
could work in other countries, and as-
sistance in the reception and placing of
Unesco fellowship holders.
After adopting the report on Unes-
co's role in the United Nations Technical
Assistance programme, the Conference
declared that, 7M programme of econo-
m ; c development, as opposed to econo-
mic expansion, can be carried out with-
out a simultaneous increase in educa-
fMKa ! programmes aimed at securing
the intelli, qent participation of the peo-
ples concerned."
Inter-Cultural Exchanges
DELEGATES made a realistic approachto an undertaking to which the
countries of Latin America attach
great importance-the translation of
Latin American classics. Governments
and National Commissions were asked
to give the utmost support to the Unes-
co project for the translation into En-
glish and French of these classics and of
contemporary works, which would help
to increase the knowledge of Latin Ame-
rican culture throughout the world.
They also emphasized the need to dis-
seminate these works in their original
language throughout the
countries of Latin Ameri-
ca, so as to make the cul-
ture of each country
known in the others.
To assist these efforts
towards the development
of mutual knowledge, Na-
tional Commissions were
asked to set up committees
to carrv out the trans-
lations and to ensure the
distribution of the works,
while governments were
asked to take action for
the abolition of obstacles
to the circulation of books,
reviews and newspapers.
A certain number of
Conference resolutions
were addressed to Unesco,
which was asked, for
example, to assist in the
organization of a Seminar
on the subject of Human
Rights to be held towards
the end of 1951. Unesco
was also asked to help In
the publication of a Span-
ish basic vocabulary pre-
pared by the University of
Porto-Rico, and to sponsor
a Congress of all the
American Universities.
A New impetus
THE greatest number of Conferencerecomm ndations, h wever, wer
directed towards the Governments
and National Commissions of the
Western Hemisphere. The most signi-
ficant of these, because it provides the
means of giving a new impetus to the
collaboration of Latin American coun-
tries in the carrying out of Unesco's
programme, concerned the re-organiza-
tion and the provision of budgets for
National Commissions as well as the
creation of permanent national secreta-
riats.
(The text of this resolution appears
on page 10.)
Action called for by this recommen-
dation includes the review by Member
States of the composition of their Na-
tional Commissions. To enable these
Commissions to work more effectively,
the resolution urged that they should
include representatives of governmental
bodies interested in Unesco's aims, pub-
lic or private institutions, women's or-
ganizations, labour and youth associa-
tions of an educational, scientific or
cultural nature, and international cul-
tural organizations, so that the general
public may be more closely associated
with Unesco's work.
The full implication of this recom-
mendation lies in the fact that its au-
thors are in many cases members of
the National Commissions and Govern-
ments who are called on to carrv out
its terms. Together with other recom-
mendations, it defines, in effect, an in-
ternational cultural policy affecting 17
countries, whose representatives have
themselves formulated their national
responsibilities.
Although those who attended the Ha-
vana Conference never lost sight of the
world-wide character of Unesco's mis-
sion, several of their resolutions implied
- on the basis of decentralization-that
Unesco's Regional Office in the Western
Hemisphere situated in Havana should
be further developed. After studying
such recommendations, Unesco will
submit appropriate proposals to the
next session of the Executive Board.
One of the most important results of
the Havana meeting was summed up
by M. Torres Bodet, when fie stated :
"The Havana experiment has proved to
me that the formula to be sought is
indeed that of'Regional Conferences of
Ministers of Education and of National
Commissions'."
Unesco is now organizing the second
of these regional conferences which
will group Ministers of Education and
members of 15 National Commissions in
the Far East, South East Asia and the
South Pacific at Bangkok, next Novem-
ber.
DELEGATES are shown here inside the National Capitol at Havana, during the inaugural
meeting of the Regional Conference.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 8 FEBRUARY 195 I
Latin America's Regional Fundamental Education Training and Production Centre is to be cpened near
Patzcuaro, (above) one of Mexico's loveliest lakes, which is located nearly 7, 000 feet above sea level. The
lake and the ancient own of Patzcuaro are in the old Tarascan Indian stronghold of Michoacan.
The Regional Conference of Une, sco National Commissions held recently i  Havana gavespecial attention to the subject of fundamental education, for problems involved in
launching this type of educational programme are among the most urgent of those
facing Latin American educators today.
Addressing a conference group which studied questions of fundamental education in
Latin America, M. Jaime Torres Bodet, Unesco's Director-General traced the history of Unesco's
Fundamental Education Programme and described the work done by the Organization through
its missions, seminars and pilot projects.
The Director-General also announced the opening in Patzcuaro, Mexico, of the first
regional fundamental education training and production centre, set up by the Organi-
zation of American States and Unesco with the help of the Mexican Government.
The Wtai rote thh new centre can play in helping to meet the need for trained fundamental
education teachers and effective teaching materiab, not only in Latin America, but in other
parts of the world, is described in the following article.
SEVENTY million persons impri-, JOned behind a wall of igno-
rance constitute a burden that
is today handicapping the economic
and social progress of an entire Con-
tinent-Latin America.
This figure-70, 000, 000-is a
recent estimate of the number of illi-
terates in Latin America'where indi-
vidual countries are facing up square-
ly, though often with limited means,
to the problems posed by populations
with an average literacy rate believed
to be about 55 per cent.
Liberal provisions for education
were written into the constitutions of
nearly all these nations when they
shook off outside domination and,
today, some are spending as much as
one-fourth of their national budgets
on schooling.
Latin American educators have also
long realized that illiteracy is vir-
tually a synonym for hunger, disease,
poverty and wastage of human re-
sources. For decades, they have
worked on the principle that illiteracy
is only part of a way of life that must
be changed. Literacy for its own sake
is not enough.
The key to this change is the teach-
er. Mass produced drugs can be
used to attack such diseases as yaws
and malaria but there is no such
thing as a mass-produced teacher
and teachers are what are needed to
attack illiteracy and ignorance and
the other"diseases"that spring from
them to afflict the people.
Educators can point to many
examples where campaigns against
ignorance and low living standards.
even though they have started off in
a spectacular way, have slowed down
and failed to produce lasting results
in the face of a shortage of teachers
and educational materials.
Today, the problem of making good
these two deficiencies has been singled
out for attack by Unesco under a plan
to establish an international faculty
for training teachers of fundamental

A School For TacticiansJ
In The Fight Against

education-a term coined by Unesco
to describe ways of teaching people
to live fuller and better lives in their
own surroundings. The plan also
provides for the development and
production of adequate educational
materials by this teachers'college.
Although illiteracy is a world pro-
blem, methods of literacy teaching
have usually to be devised to meet
the needs of individual regions.
Unesco therefore decided to organize
its faculty on a local basis and thus
the idea of regional training and pro-
duction centres came into being. In
October, 1949, the Mexican govern-
ment offered to. help Unesco establish
such a centre in Mexico to serve Latin
America. In the same month the
Organization of American States
joined the plan.
Latin America will therefore be the
first of five regions-the others are
the Far East, India, the Middle East
and Equatorial Africa-to benefit
from the work of what Unesco calls
a"fundamental education training
and production centre". With the
other regions, it comes under a
$20, 000, 000 plan to create a world
network of six such centres, training
some 4, 000 fundamental education
teachers of teachers over twelve years.
Teaching farmers how to fight plant diseases and
insect pests is an important part of rura ! fundamen-
tal education. Here, Mexican farmers learn about
potato diseases from experts working under the
joint agricultural programme ofthe Mexican Govern-ment and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Teachers of Teachers
THe plan was adopted by Unesco'-sExecutive Board last November
and has still to be approved by
the next Unesco General'Conference
TWO APPROACHES TO LITERACY TEACHING. Using Mexican communities as"laborato-
ries", students at the Patzcuaro Fundamental Education Centre will test the relative effectiveness of
two teaching methods-direct instruction in Spanish and the use of the local language with a later
transition to Spanish. The Illustrations above demonstrate different approaches to this problem in
two Latin American countries. They show (1) a page from"Cartilla Tarasco-Espanol", a literacy
primer in Tarascan and Spanish, which offers a bridge from a vernacular to a regional language and (2)
a Brazilian prinier which goes straight into the regional anguage, Portuguese, and makes learning
as streamlined as possible.
This Mexican wall newspaper ina rural community meets both a social and an educational need. It keeps
people up-to-date with local and national news and provides auseful form of follow-up reading material for
newly literate men and women.
in June before it can go into full
operation. However, it is already
becoming a reality for Latin America
whose Mexican Centre plans to train
more than 1, 000 fundamental educa-
tion specialists in twelve years. Com-
pared to 70, 000, 000 illiterates, the
number 18 infinitesimal, but the
centre will train teachers of teachers.
Graduates will go out to staff similar
centres organized by individual na-
tions, so that teachers will be formed
by a kind of"chain reaction"process.
The programme of the'centre will
be familiar to most Latin American
countries where educators believe, if
the people cannot go to schools, in
bringing schools to them. One coun-
try uses"cultural missions", another
"cultural brigades", and still another
"travelling schools", but the idea of
a mobile team of education specialists
runs throughout these programmes.
Such teams usually are made up of
experts on literacy, hygiene, home
economics, practical farming me-
thods, or perhaps handicraft indus-
tries and organized recreation. They
visit rural regions by motor truck, on
muleback or even by river boat.
Often teaching becomes a secondary
task : the first job is to convince

people that education has something
to oner them.
The worth of these teams has
1>een shown in Mexico, only one of a
number of countries using them.
There, cultural missions have been
given much of the credit for an in-
crease in rural school attendance
from 50, 000 to 683, 000. Other pro-
gress, in terms of healthier diets,
better housing, wiser use of land and
a growth of co-operation, is more dif-
Ücult to translate into statistics.
Unesco has incorporated this
"team"technique into its plan to
train teachers to accomplish on a
larger scale what individual nations
have shown can be done. Students
at the Latin American regional cen-
tre, and other centres that may follow
it, will begin their training as a team,
work as a team and return to their
own country as a highly-trained unit
of specialists.
When the centre opens this year at
Patzcuaro in the Mexican state of
Michoacan, it will have an interna-
tional student body drawn from such
professions as adult educators, sani-
tary engineers, rural schoolteachers,
nurses and agricultural experts. At
first, there will be fifty students ; ten
from Mexico and forty from other
Latin American countries, all studying
under Unesco grants. There will be
accommodation for up to 100 students,
the fifty others to be sent under
fellowships provided by their own
governments.
Community
"Laboratories"
P atzcuaro, which lies in a moun-tain region dotted with lakes
and which is often called the"Swit-
zerland"of Mexico, was chosen as the
centre's site because of the variety of
communities available for study in its
immediate neighbourhood. Its Indian
population, the Tarascans, have
shown, in the past, a healthy desire
for education.
The early start of operations at the
Mexican centre is being made possible
The Tarascan people, of whom those at Patzcuaro are the proud descendants,
were an advanced, artistic and poetic race with a melodious language and a
tradition of many handicrafts. Today, as in the past, they fish in dugouts
on the jade-green waters of Lake Patzcuaro, using graceful butterfly nets to
catch the swarming silver"charales". Traditions and customs preserved
frompre-Spanish times still play an important role in the lives of the Tarascans.
by preliminary research undertaken
by the centre's staff, under the direc-
tion of Lucas Ortiz, former head of
Mexico's rural education department,
and by Mexican educators and go-
vernment officials.
They have already selected the
areas and communities which will
serve as"laboratories"for the centre.
One is typical of Mexico's tropical
lowlands, another of her mountain
regions and the third has a problem
faced by nearly all Latin American
educators-that of a population
speaking a local language without
fixed spelling or grammar. There,
the centre's students will test the
effectiveness of two teaching me-
thods ; the one being direct teaching
of literacy in Spanish and the other
the development of literacy in the
local language with a later transition
to Spanish.
This research into local conditions
will be expanded gradually by the
centre until it covers the needs of all
Latin America. For this task, the
centre is equipped with a research li-
brary and also with a documentation
exchange service designed to keep
both the centre's staff and Latin
American educators abreast of tech-
niques in their area. Students
themselves will contribute to this
research, even before beginning their
eight-month training course, by
writing an entrance"thesis"on fun-
damental education in their own
countries.
Research facilities will also be pro-
vided by a"bureau of production"in
Washington operated by the Organiz-
ation of American States, an example
of the close co-operation among in-
ternational organizations, which ha. s
made the foundation of the centre
possible. The centre's staff, for
example, will include specialists from
three other United Nations agencies
- the World Health Organization, the
International Labour Organization
and the Food and Agricultural Orga-
nization.
Equal importance will be given to
the production side of the centre's
programme. The need to develop the
right materials for both teachers and
pupils was illustrated recently by a
member of an international adult
education seminar who told his col-
leagues wryly :"In my country, we
taught 30, 000 people how two read in
POSTERS FOR PROGRESS. These striking, coloured posters used
by Brazil in its nation-wide adult education campaign have proved their
worth as a means of arousing public interest in the literacy drive and of
providing useful health hints. The texts of those shown above read :
(right)"With these weapons we shall win."and (left)"Sleep protected
from the malaria mosquito-use mosquito nets."
six weeks-but six weeks. later, they
were illiterate again because they had
nothing they could read.".
Follow... up
To Literacy
When a newly-literate adult dis-covers the only available ma-
terial at his reading level to have
been written for children, he can
hardly be blamed for concluding that
illiteracy was not after all such a
disadvantage. One purpose of the
centre's production division is to pro-
vide him With reading material which
fills an immediate need in his daily
life. If being literate can help to
teach a farmer how to keep insects
from ruining his harvest, it has a
practical value which is immediately
obvious to him.
The language and illustrations used
in fundamental education teaching
materials must be as local as the
conditions they are designed to
change. The production experts at
Patzcuaro will work to develop texts,
films and filmstrips which can be
easily assimilated by audiences often
brought up on long traditions of
hostility to"strangers"and the new
ideas they may bring.
One film strip production method
open to the centre i. s that employed
by members of Unesco's Audio-Visual
Fundamental Education Project in
China. There, a new technique-the
use of paint and ink directly on films
- was applied by local artists. Such
artists, when they have been shown
the lesson to be taught, can express
themselves in a language and in sym-
bols which are real and familiar to
the local people and thus more likely
to produce effective results.
The centre will develop materials,
test them in Mexican communities
and then offer them as samples and
models to other Latin American
countries, but with an annual budget
of little more than $100, 000 to cover
both staff and fellowship costs, it will
not be able to publish texts or print
films on a large scale itself.
According to present plans the cen-
tre is to develop a complete range of
fundamental education materials
over five years. It will aim at a
maximum quality of production
whose cost, however, must be kept
within the financial possibilities of
economically under-developed re-
gions.
The entire programme to go into
effect at Patzcuaro, in March, is
conceived not only to meet local
needs in Latin America but also to
act as a"trail blazer"for funda-
mental education campaigns in other
parts of the world.
When these other campaigns get
under way, the educators in charge
of them will have some trustworthy.
signposts-the lessons learned at
Patzcuaro by both teachers and pu-
pils-to guide them down the best
roads.

HAVANA CONFERENCE RESOLUTIONS REFLECT
REGIONAL SUPPORT FOR UNESCO'S PROGRAMME
REPORTING on the work of the First Regional Conference of National
Commissions of the Western Hemisphere, to Unesco's Executive
Board, last m th, M. Jaim  Torres B det, the Director-General,
stated :
"The Conference might have been no more than a meeting for
information and study purposes ; even as such it was indispensable, as was
shown by the discussions. But, whether it was a question of fundamental educ-
ation... of teaching about the United Nations and the Declaration of Human
Tights, of the role of the university on the American continent, or of the develop-
ment of exchanges of persons, the Conference, both in its advice to the Secretariat
and in its recommendations to the governments concerned, showed its keen
desire for more regional co-operation within the Organization".
M. Torres Bodet added :.. The fact that, in the case of at least half
the delegations, those who voted for these resolutions were the persons directly
responsible for action, gives me considerable hope that these intentions will
be translated into fact in the near future".
The desire of National Commissions in the Western Hemisphere to
contribute actively to Unesco's programme is reflected in the texts of
conference resolutions relating to four important aspects of Unesco's
work, which are published on this page.
Assembly of the United Nations on
10 December 1948.
(b) That, to this end, the National
Commissions of every Member
State, in agreement with the
Secretariat of Unesco in Paris,
promote the establishment of
educational curricula on this
subject on the following basis :
(i) The systematic development
of theoretical and practical
teaching about human rights,
from elementary classes in
primary schools up to the
advanced (university and
technological) level, including
an examination of the meas-
ures designed to ensure those
rights and guarantees, and an
estimate of their effectiveness
in everyday life ;
(ii) The attaching of greater im-
portance to a knowledge of the
bases of each human right
studied than to the actual
means whereby the right is
given legal effect.
(iii) The carrying out of a national
and international campaign of
civic education, in which
teaching in the schools, among
the public as a whole, and
in non-scholastic institutions
shall be included, with a view
to preparing all people for the
exercise of the rights and the
fulfilment of the obligations
laid down in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
of 10 December 1948.
(iv) The special emphasizing of
the fact that the rights of the
individual imply and define
,'obligations on his part as
regards co-operation, living inSociety, responsibility and
maximum respect, for the
dignity of other men...
(c) That, in those countries which
have not yet inaugurated official
curricula for teaching about hu-
man rights, the curricula referred
to in paragraph (b) be placed at
the disposal of the governments
concerned by 1 April 1951 at the
latest.
NATIONAL COIUMISSIONS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN LATIN AMERICA
The COllferellce
(a) RECOMMENDS the governments
of the Western Hemisphere :
(i) To include in their annual
budgets allocations sufficient
to enable National Commis-
sions to make an effective
contribution to the execution
of Unesco's programme.
(ii) To consider the desirability of
setting up a permanent and
adequately remunerated Se-
cretariat for the National
Commissions called upon to
play an essential part in pro-
moting the aims and objects
of Unesco.
(iii) To arrange for frequent meet-
ings and for continuity in the
work of the National Com-
missions of the Western
Hemisphere, through the
establishment of special com-
mittees corresponding to the
chief fields of action included
in Unesco's programme and
also, where necessary, of an
Executive Committee to be
responsible for co-ordinating
the work and taking any
decisions that may be requir-
ed between plenary meetings
of the National Commission.
(iv) To invite Member States to
review the composition of
their respective National Com-
missions, with a view to
enabling them to carry out
their work more effectively,
ensuring that they represent
governmental bodies interest-
ed in Unesco's aims, public or
private institutions, women's
organizations, labour and
youth associations of an
educational, scientific or cul-
tural nature, and international
cultural organizations, so. that
the general public may be
more closely associated with
the implementation of Unes-
co's programme.
(v) To establish, whenever neces-
sary, centres affiliated to the
National Commissions, grant-
ing them adequate premises
and assuring them of the
support of the administrative
and university authorities and
of cultural organizations.
(b) ALSO RECOMMENDS the Nation-
al Commissions of the Western.
Hemisphere :
(i) To contribute by all appropri-
ate means to the implement-
ation of Unesco's annual pro-
gramme and special projects,
the maintenance of contact
between the latter and the
national organizations, and
the dissemination of inform-
ation concerning the objects
and activities of Unesco.
(ii> For that purpose, to make a
careful study at the beginning
of 1951, of Unesco document/
XR/14 concerning the partici-
pation of National Commis-
sions in the execution of the
programme for 1951, and to
draw up on the basis of that
document a detailed plan of
action for the year.
(iii) To prepare a complete list of
the educational, scientific and
cultural bodies in their res-
pective countries, both for
their own convenience, and for
the information of Unesco and
particularly of the Regional
Office at Havana, to which
reports should be sent.
(iv To establish, whenever possible,
particularly in educational
centres, associations of friends
of Unesco.
TEACHING ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS
The Conference'J
RECOMMENDS to the Governments
of the American countries :
(a) That they promote throughout
their territories, as soon as possi-
ble, public and private teaching
not only about the human rights
and fundamental freedoms
enshrined in their countries'
Constitutions, but also, and as
intensively as possible, about the
rights set forth in the Universal
Declaration which was approved
and proclaimed by the General
The Co.. lereøe
RECOMMENDS
(a) That Unesco and the Mexican
Government be congratulated on
the setting up of the Mexican
Scientific Bibliographical Centre,
the Conference being fully cons-
dent that the work of the said
Centre will benefit the whole of
Latin America and that branches
will be set up as soon as possible
in the Latin American countries.
(b) That, in co-operation with the
other Agencies of the United
Nations, Unesco carry out a survey
on the native problem in Latin
America, especially on native
education.
(c) That a seminar be organized on
the techniques to. be used in de-
termining the needs for specializ-
ed personnel in Latin America.
(d) That a seminar be organized to
study the results of Unesco's
enquiry and activities in the
matter of Technical Needs in Mass
Communication (Film, Press and
Radio) in Latin America, and to
draw up a programme for dealing
with those needs.
(e) That study groups or seminars on
scientific questions connected
with the economic development of
the Latin American countries be
organized within the general plan
of Technical Assistance, with the
special purpose of studying various
scientific aspects of the conserva-tion and use of the Continent's
natural resources.
(f) That the Director-General of
Unesco be requested to send the
five foregoing recommendations to
the Latin American Governments
for ratification, approval of those
recommendations being regarded
as constituting official requests for
technical assistance to Latin
America.
(g) That the National Commissions of
the Western Hemisphere be re-
quested to collaborate in the
implementation of the Technical
Assistance Plan...
FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION
The First Regional Conference of
National Commissions of the Western
Hemisphere considers that the train-
ing of teachers and the production of
teaching materials are of the greatest
importance in fundamental education,
and it therefore submits the following
recommendations concerning the
better and more effective co-operation
of the National Commissions, and
concerning the Regional Centre to be
established at Patzcuaro under the
auspices of Unesco :
(a) The greatest possible number of
fellowships should be obtained for
each country.
(b) The number of fellowships should
be established in accordance with
the cultural needs and the geogra-
phical situation of each country...
THE CONFERENCE
HAVING carefully considered the
"project for the establishment of a
world network of regional fundamental
education centres"submitted by
Unesco's Director-General ;
CONSCIOUS of the need of trained
staff and suitable teaching materials
for ensuring the success of the world-
wide fundamental education campaign
sponsored by Unesco ;
NOTES with satisfaction that the
first Regional Centre has been estab-
[lShed by OAS and Unesco, with the
help of the Mexican Government, in
order to meet the needs of Latin
America in trained staff and suitable
teaching materials for fundamental
education ; and,
DESIROUS of seeing the work of
the Regional Fundamental Education
Centre in Latin America serve as an
example for similar centres in other
parts of the world,
RECOMMENDS the National Com-
missions of the Western Hemisphere
and the Third Meeting of Represent-
atives of National Commissions to
give their full support to Unesco's
project and to facilitate its execution
by all appropriate means.

of the Fouad 1st University, the 75th
anniversary of the Royal Geographical
Society and the inauguration of the
Fouad 1st Desert Institute.
Visitors went from one memorable
experience to another as they visited
and marvelled at the work of creative
artists belonging to a civilization
several thousand years old ; and then
went on to inspect the universities
and scientific laboratories of Modern
Egypt.
Tradition And Techniques
THIS demonstration of Cairo's cul-
tural wealth was more than a
mere pr of of national creative
genius. The ceremonies truly cons-
tituted a demonstration of the spirit
and purpose of Unesco-even a
contribution to the work of the
Organization. Both the presence of
Count Jacini, Chairman of Unesco's
Executive Board, and the Director-
General of Unesco, and the speeches
they made, symbolized the spirit of
friendly co-operation that exists bet-
ween Unesco and this Member State.
Visitors to the Fouad 1st University,
a well-equipped block of buildings
designed on simple architectural lines,
also inspected the time-hallowed
mosque of EI Azhar. Here, for more
than a 1, 000 years, Koranic teachings
have been passed down from genera-
tion to generation ; and the visitor
begins to understand the force of a
spiritual tradition among a people
with so many of its fine scientific
foundations. It was ! designed to
furnish scientists with research equip-
ment to assist the discovery and full
development of agricultural, animal
and mineral resources in the vast
desert regions surrounding the Nile
Valley. The construction of these
buildings and the drawing up of plans
and programmes covered a period of
by Jean THOMAS
who also welcome the most recent'
branches of learning and technique.
During their visit, Count Jacini and
M. Torres Bodet met members of the
Egyptian National Commission, to
explain Unesco's programme and the
results that have already been
obtained, and to point out projects
where Egypt's collaboration can be
most useful. From Unesco's point of
view, much useful information was
obtained and it is likely that the
Egyptian National Commission drew
equal benefit from this visit.
The Desert Institute
THE Desert Institute, inaugurated
on December 30, was part of an
immense programme conceived by
King Fouad 1st, who provided Egypt
more than 20 years. King Fouad did
not live to see the realization of the
project to which he had devoted so
much time and thought and it was
his son, King Farouk, who attended
the inauguration ceremony of the
Desert Institute.
M. Torres Bodet and His Excellency
Taha Hussein Pasha, Minister ot
Public Information for Egypt, both
hailed the excellent example set by
the new Institute and the opportunities
it offers-not only to the Egyptian
people, but to all peoples fwhose
existence depends on the development
of arid zones. Emphasis was placed
on the need for international collabo-
ration, in this continual struggle.
Implicit in the ceremony, was a
mutual desire that Unesco assist the
Cairo Institute in its work and that
the latter contribute to similar enter-
prises undertaken by Unesco.
A Model Museum
IN Cairo, there is a recently built
museum. It is perhaps the most
modest mus um in th  city, yet it
could constitute a model for the rest of
the world. Temporarily housed in an
iron and cement tower, this Museum
of Egyptian Civilization offers a series
of diorama, mural paintings, photo-
graphs and reproductions of particular
interest to students of Egyptology.
Of more general interest, is a résumé
of Egyptian history told in a display
of authentic objects and original
works, dating from the time of the
Pharaohs to the present day, each
epoch shown by picturesque scenes,
and samples of its art, science, agri-
culture and industry.
Thousands of children and young
people, under the guidance of teachers,
come every month to learn, by means
of these concrete examples that can
be so easily understood, how much
their ancestors accomplished, for the
civilization of their country.
The recent Egyptian visit gave an
insight into the beautiful and the
picturesque. But its effect was less to
charm than to instruct the visitor and
cause him to reflect.
UNESCO NATIONAL COMMISSION AND FOUAD 1 DESERT INSTITUTE INAUGURATED IN EGYPT
T liE EgpliüIl. \', tliOIlül Comlllbsionfour Unesco was inaugurated in
Cairo on December 28, by Cnes-
co's Director-General,, M. Jaime Tor-
res Bodet, in the presence of mem-
bers of the Egyptian Government, in-
cluding the Ministers for Education,
Social Affairs aid Economics.
In his address Unesco's Director-
General appealed for support of Unes-
co's work for peace, for, he said,
"There is M man nor people in the
leorld so rich lIS to have nothing tao
gain from the help of others, nor any
man our people so poor as to have
not/dng to lose in a world-Wide con-
flayration. H'hatever its result, the
final balance sheet of any war would
reveal appalling loss. Not only would
lires and wealth be thrown away, but
mankinll itself would emergelt'Ì ! h
shrunken stature."
M. Torres Bodet recalled the growth
of Arab culture, and the efforts of the
Egyptian monarchy to increase the
number of institutes of learning and
education, to found universities and
show *By such initiative that"the
Egypt of today is determined again to
enter that path, wltieh, in the Golden
Age of Islam, brought her her brigh-
test fame."
A warm tribute was paid by the
Director-General to Egypt's Minister
of Education, Dr. Taha Hussein Pasha,
whom, he said"has accomplished in
an extraordinarily brief space of time
results which display a keen awa-
reness of our age's tasks,""These
in themselves are titles eMugh",
he went on,"but Dr. Taha Hussein
Pasha has yet others. André Gide has
said of him :'What may pe>rhaps as-
tonish MS... is fundamentally the exam-
ple that his life affords of a success,
a triumps of the will, a palient victo-
ry of mental vision over the sha-
dol () S."
Task For The"New Man"
THE inauguration of the EgyptianNational Commission was follow-
ed on December 30 by the open-
ing of the Fouad I Desert Institute
at Hel. iopotis near Cairo.
Work un this Institute began in
1930 during the reign of King Fouad I,
who gave orders for its construction.
The war, however, delayed completion
of the building.
The structure, designed in Arab
style, is surrounded by a garden, part
of which is devoted to the cultivation
of plants from the Egyptian deserts,
and to experiments in their acclima-
tisation to different conditions.
The role of the Desert Institute is
to make studies and carry out practi-
cal research on Egypt's deserts. It
will study too various climates, geo-
logy, mineral, agricultural and zoo-
logical resources, as well as perfecting
ways of preventing the invasion of
arable land by the sands of the de-
sert. The Institute also includes a
museum of considerable scientific in-
terest.
Such an initiative on the part of the
Egyptian Government links up with
the programme of Unesco. which en-
visages the seating up of an Interna-
tional Institute of the Arid Zones.
Such areas comprise almost a quarter
of the world's surface.
Recalling this fact in his speech at
the Institute's inauguration, M. Torres
Bodet added :
"These empty tracts are an untold
loss at a time when the productive
land can barely feed half the world's
population. The improvement of this
situation is one of the primary tasks
of the new man that Unesco hopes
ldll emerge-a man who not only
thinks in terms of the world as a
whole but also acts on a basis of soli-
darity towards his feUow men. Man
has suffered many a setback in this
battle against the desert ; he has had
to retreat beJore the hostile land that
will have none of him. These reverses
were suffered when men were fight-
ing sfnglelwnded. But once the peo-
ple as a whole make a concerted e/-
{art to overcome their adversary, that

of cultivation on each side of the river. The role of the recently inaugu-
rated Fouad Desert Institute is to carry out research into ways of increas-
ing the area of this fertile region.
udt'efa/'y Idll in its turn lie {o/'ced to
retreat, leaving men to enjoy the ex-
panse they have brought back to live."
Triumph Over Nature
D. Taha Hussein Pasha in hisaddress paid homage to King
Farouk and his dynasty for seek-
ing to aid the spread of science, and
the development of scientific organiza-
tions within the country, and to use
these means for establishing a close
scientific liaison with other countries.
"/t is vitally important that the East
should finally be ßndowed'wUh a
modern Desert (Mute", declared the
Minister."Egypt will not be the only
country to ogain by it. Its effect will
be felt throughout the world. Scien-
tific establishments belong to all hu-
manity. The founder of a university
not only renders a service to his come-
try, but to all other countries.
"Only the great", continued Dr. Ta-
ha Hussein Pasha, are capable of such
undertakings as this, which aims at
reducing desert expanses and elimi-
nating the causes of fear bll fertilizing
the desert, and transformmg it into
an oasis'of science, knowledge and
tranquillity.
"We, more than any other people",
he said,"are influenced by the desert.
Shut in on two sides, our Great Nile
flows in reality lire a trickle between
two immense deserts.
"If we think constantly of the desert
it is because it affects us deeply. Our
ancient Arab literature has depicted it
as both marvellous and terrible-as
the source of fear and consternation.
"In conceiving the project of this
Institute, King Fouad wished that it
should become a centre for scientists
devoted to research on soil, climate,
desert flora and fauna-a field of
experiment and study available to
scholars of other countries-a centre
where science would demonstrate its
triumph over the forces of nature.
"The eminent men meeting here
to-day", the Minister conc ! uded,"are
proof of the success'of King Fouad's
belief that the Institute must be a
centre of co-operation betwen men".

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12
FEBRUARY 195 I
RANCE and Italy have offered financialhelp to permit Unesco to make a prelimi-
nary study this year into the possibility of
setting up a West European Physics Laboratory
for High Energy Particles. An offer of 2, 000, 000
lire from the National Research Council of Italy
was accepted by Unesco's Executive Board at
its meeting last month, and it was indicated
that the French Government was considering
making a donation of 2, 000, 000 francs.
The study is to be made under the direction
of Unesco's Natural Science Department, which
is headed by Professor Pierre Auger. The
possibility of helping to establish a West Euro-
pean Physics Laboratory has been examined by
Professor Auger since Unesco's General Confe-
rence approved the setting up of such regional
centres last June.
Home For A Cosmotroa
p ROFESSOR AUGER considers that the WestEuropean physics laboratory should house
a cosmotron-a giant machine which would
be able to reproduce in the laboratory, high
energy particles at present being extensively
studied outside laboratories, through research
into the mysterious cosmic rays which reach
the earth from outer space. The cosmotron,
therefore, would enable great advances to be
made in nuclear Physics in Western Europe.
When a preliminary report on the possi-
bility of establishing the West European
centre is completed, it will be presented to a
meeting of experts to be convened by Unesco.
A number of Western European nations are
interested in the project, and additional
financial help is expected. By the
terms of the Conference resolution, Unesco is
undertaking to discover the needs and possi-
bilities for the regional centres, to make initial
surveys of cost estimates and locations, and to
help in the formulation of programmes, but not
to contribute to the cost of construction or main-
tenance out of its regular budget.
Unesco will not, moreover, be the governing
body of the West European centre. It is con-
cerned at this stage with carrying out the
studies needed to assure its establishment.
Conference Preparations
OTHER questions dealt with by the UnescoExecutive Board at its meeting included
the Organization's 1952 programme. The Board
recommended its adoption by the next General
Conference which will take place in Paris from
June 18 to July 10.
In approving the Conference agenda, the
Board agreed 10 send invitations to non-Member
states of the United Nations and Unesco to send
observers to these meetings. These States
include, among others, Spain, Cambodia, Laos
and Vietnam. The three last, like Japan and
the German Federal Republic, have asked to be
admitted to Unesco. Their candidatures will
first be submitted to the Economic and Social
Council of the United Nations, which will mee'
during February at Santiago.
After approval by the Board, Unesco will
make a grant of $266, 750 to eleven non-govern-
mental international organizations which co-
operate with Unesco in an advisory capacity.
The Board has also approved the use of
donations amounting to nearly $2, 500 for urgent
relief work being carried out by Unesco in diffe-
rent parts of the world.
Unesco's activities in Germany and Japan
were also studied by the Board. Unesco's work
in Germany will be centralised in a single
bureau to be set up at Wiesbaden, which will
replace the three now operating in the English,
French and American zones. This modified
plan for Unesco centres in Germany was made
with the approval of the three representatives
of the Allied High Commission, and it is felt
will facilitate the execution of the Organiza-
tion's programme.
It is planned to create three other centres
in Germany for the study of social questions,
teaching and all problems affecting German
youth. New offers of financial aid for this pro-
ject have recently been received from Lebanon,
the Philippines, France and the United States.
UNIFORM BRAILLE FOR
ASIA AND AFRICA TO
BE WORKED OUT AT
BEIRUT CONFERENCE
White hands guide black hands
over Braille script. The hands of
Mr. Wilson, blind secretary of the
British Empire Society for the Blind,
show an African how Braille script is
read. The work and findings of the
Committee on African Tribal Braille
will be submitted to experts attending
the international conference at Beirut,
this month.
ANOTHER important step toward the de-velopment of a universal script for
blind readers of all the world's lan-
guages is to be taken at an internatio-
nal conference of Braille experts, seven of
whom are themselves blind, which is to open
under Unesco auspices in Beirut on Februa-
ry 12. Fourteen representatives of eleven
countries will meet, as the guests of the Go-
vernment of Lebanon, to put the final tou-
ches to a uniform Braille system for the lan-
guages of the Middle East, India, Southeast
Asia and Africa.
One of the major tasks to be carried out at
the conference is the replacement, by a sin-
gle system, of several varieties of Arabic
adaptations of Braille, thus removing con-
flicts among these variants which have long
hindered the education in Arabic of blind
children.
Braille is the system of raised dots by which
the blind read and write, learn music and
do mathematics and shorthand. It has sixty-
three characters ; and it is the goal of the
development of a universal script that in
every language, each of the sixty-three cha-
racters should, as far as possible, stand for
the same, or nearly the same letter-sound.
Representatives to the Beirut conleience
will include linguists, phoneticians, blind
educationists and Braillists. They have been
invited from Malaya, Ceylon, India, Pakistan,
Persia, Iraq, Hashemite Jordan, Lebanon, Sy-
ria, Egypt and French North Africa, and re-
ports from other linguistic areas will also
be presented. When the work of which the
Conference of regional experts is an impor-
tant part, is finished, the world's 7. 000, 000
blind will have a universal script, though
not a common language.
The Beirut meeting IS a development from
an agreement on the principles of world
Braille arrived at by conferences at Unesco
House ; Paris, in December 1949 and March
1950. Steady progress has been made in
the rationalization of the world use of Braille
since the second of these conferences. The
Indian Government's Expert Committee pub-
lished a revised Braille for India in confor-
mity with the conference recommendations,
) ast October, under the title of"Bharati
Braille". This draft, together with those pre-
pared by an Arabic Sub-Committee and a
Committee on African Tribal Languages, and
other views on the same and similar pro-
blems will be considered at Beirut.
. The agenda of the meeting includes stu-
dy of uniformity in Braille musical notation
and of Arabic Braille contractions as well
as uniformity in letters and punctuation, and
the special requirements of various linguis-
tic groups.
Unesco's principal representative at the
Beirut Conference will be Sir Clutha Mac-
kenzie, consultant on Braille, himself a blind
man.
COUNTRIES ANSWER UNESCO
CALL FOR LIFTING OF BARRIERS
TO KNOWLEDGE
, { EMBER States of Unesco have recently been taking
law action in response to a series of eleven recommenda-
tions adopted in Florence last year by the
General Conference, on measures they might take to
promote the free now of information. The recommenda-
tions, aimed at suppressing economic and legal obstacles
to the movement of ideas, were sent to governments last
September. Replies received to date will be supplemented
by the reports Member States are to submit to the next
session of the General Conference in June.
Action taken on the first recommendation, urging
adherence to the two Unesco-sponsored international
Agreements, was reflected in the signature by 17 countries
of the Agreement on the Importation of Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Materials on the day it was
opened at Lake Success. Eighteen countries have already
signed, and four ratified the earlier Unesco Agreement
for the free Sow of auditory and visual materials.
Following are some examples of other measures already
taken by governments in response to the Florence
recommendations :
Belgium is increasing its support for a scheme, initiated
by the Universal Postal Union (UPU), which allows
readers to pay in their national currency, at their local
post office, for subscriptions to newspapers and magazines
from abroad. Belgium is willing to carry out this
exchange with all Member States of the UPU.
Bolivia has granted duty-free entry to publications,
documents, films and recordings sent by international
organizations to its Government or Unesco National
Commission.
government'our
Canada has granted duty-free entry to certain edu-
cational fUms.
"
Colombia has granted duty-free entry to all Unesco
books, publications and other educational, scientific and
cultural materials consigned to approved institutions.
cultural
Denmark is negotiating a newspaper exchange with
Austria, Italy and West Germany, under the UPU scheme
already mentioned.
n
India has reduced by two-thirds the postal rate on
newspapers mailed abroad.
Iraq has reduced by 50 per cent. the postal rate on
publications sent abroad by local publishers or printers.
n
Italy has resumed its newspaper exchange service and
is willing to extend it to other countries on a reciprocal
basis.
n
The Netherlands has extended its newspaper exchange
to four more countries (Finland, French zone of Morocco,
Portugal and Sweden) and is negotiating an exchange
with Austria and West Germany.
Norway is also willing to extend its newspaper exchange
to other countries.
Sweden is extending its newspaper exchange to Italy,
Portugal and West Germany.
John  Taylor Takes
Over No. 2 Unesco Post
Dr. John W. Taylor, American educator and former president ofthe University of Louisville, Kent ky, took over his new duties
as Deputy Director-General of Unesco on January 8th 1951.
"1 come to Unesco", Dr. Taylor said on his arrival at Unesco House,
"at o time when there is perhaps more need of international understanding
than at any other previous period in history. I feel, however, that it is dif-
ficult to do what can and should be done in the world while more than half
the human beings whose destinies are at stave-literally and personally
at stake-can neither read nor write."
"1 feel that Unesco, despite all the tragic fears and forebodings of the
period through which we are passing, has the opportunity to bring light to
the places in men's minds darkened by ignorance, and hence to help make
a real and informed hope for peace rePlace resignation to the inevitability of
war"
While Dr. Taylor was president of the University of Louisville, the
institution became the first among those in the southern part of the
United States to break racial barriers and admit Negro students. Unes-
co's new Deputy Director-General has had wide and varied experience
in the field of international education. He has spent six years in Western
Europe ; has studied at the Universities of Paris, London, Vienna and
Berlin ; and has been in charge of the Foreign Study Programme of
Teachers College, Columbia University.

FEBRUARY 1951, Page 13-UNESCO COURIER
MARCINE :
BIGGEST
"FAMILY"
ON the outskirts of Charleroi, inthe heart of Belgium's"black
country", a trim little com-
munity of ultra-modern homes laid
out over 30 acres of gardens and
playgrounds contrasts sharply with
the background of towering steel
mill chimneys and coal mine
shaftheads.
Only one thing in the communi-
ty's appearance help to distinguish
it from a typical modern suburban
development project-its gateway
whose arch bears the words,
"City de l'Enfance" (The Chil-
dren's City). Living in its neat
little houses today are 330 orphans
and children of war refugees
- children who had never known
a proper home, but who have now
found an ideal one.
The movement responsible for
the City is the"Inter-Community
Organization for Social. Works"
(Intercommunal d'CEuvre Social)
of the Charleroi region, which has
been set up by the people of Char-
leroi and of thirty-two neighbour-
ing communities. To provide homes
for the children in the City at
Marcinelle, a suburb of Charleroi,
costs the inhabitants of these
thirty or so communities the sum
of ten Belgian francs ($ 0. 20) per
capita each year. In addition, the
City receives a subsidy from the
Belgian Government.
The reason for the City's foun-
dation and development has been
explained by M. René de Cooman,
president of the Board of directors,
as"a desire to create a home where
orphans would live in an atmo-
sphere and under conditions as
far removes, as possible from those
of an'institution'."
The result was a community of
twenty-one, two-storey homes, each
housing no more than sixteen
children with an individual coun-
selor in each home.
The Children Understood
THE houses are ultra-modern inappearance and in equipment,
with electric kitchens, central
heating, hot and cold running
water, and tiled bathrooms.
"When we planned these
houses,"M. de Cooman recalls,
"people told us they were too good
tor the children, but we maintained
that children would understand
PLENTY OF PLAYMATES. Children have no time to feel alone in the world when they have
over 300"brothers and sisters"to join them in games and sports.
what we were trying to do for them
and would respect their homes,"
Proof of this came in rather an
unusual way. As the result of the
war, some children had to be
moved into an unfinished house, in
the early years of the City, before
the furniture was varnished and
the walls plastered. This particu-
lar house suffered more damage
from unruliness among the
children than others which were
opened in an already perfect state.
The City is equipped with a
gymnasium, a wading pool, sand
beaches and workshops where its
adolescent citizens can learn to
become cabinet-makers, electri-
cians, bakers, gardeners, tailors
and shoemakers.
If a child shows promise, he is
encouraged to continue his studies
for such professions as medicine
or law."Our children have as
much right to choose their careers
! lS those who are lucky enough to
have wealthy parents,"explains
M. de Cooman.
Children's Ambassador
AT present, the City's inhabi-tants range from three to
twenty-five years of age, but
plans are being made to accom-
modate even younger ones in a
new nursery now being completed.
The older members of the commu-
nity often work outside in Char-
leroi and live in the City just as
they would in an ordinary home.
Children below the age of twelve
live in houses with dormitory-style
sleeping quarters. Above the age
of twelve, however, each child has
a room to himself, complete with
an individual washstand. In some
cases, the care given by the City
to infants begins almost as soon as
they are born. One young girl has
been in the City ever since her
mother abandoned her in the
maternity ward of a hospital.
M. de Cooman, who was recently
elected president of the Interna-
tional Federation of Children's
Communities, an organization
working in close co-operation with
Unesco, is a Belgian industrialist
and an"ambassador"for the Mar-
cinelle Children's City.
Following a recent meeting of
the International Federation at
Unesco House in Paris, he described
a new development at Marcinelle
designed to enable the City to
extend its help to children even
after they have grown up and
left it.
By the early part of 1951, M. de
Cooman explained, the City will
begin a policy of extending
long-term, no-interest loans to
give youngsters a chance to set
themselves up in business. If a
boy learns his trade as, say, a
baker or a plumber, the City will
be able to advance him the money
to open his own shop. The money,
paid back in instalments, will be
used as a revolving fund to give
future"citizens"a start in the
world.
For other reasons too, the
Children's City of Marcinelle is
held in affection by children who
have lived within its walls. Young
men or women, leaving the city to
marry and set up a home, always
receive a wedding present from
the board of directors. At present,
the City is busy making plans for
the marriage of one of its girl
citizens. At the wedding the entire
population of more than 300
children will be present as mem-
bers of the bride's"family".
Ever-Open Gates
THE boys and girls of Marcinelleare proud to belong to such a
united family. Their affection
for it is perhaps best symbolized by
the City's ever-open gates. It is
just as easy to leave as to enter,
and although children have been
known to run away during their
first few days-before they had
had time to settle down-no one
has ever wanted to leave after
living there for several weeks.
That, for the men and women
who run the City is the best proof
that they have created a real
home for children who today no
longer consider themselves as
"orphans".
LLE : HOME OF BELGIUM'S
GATEWAY TO A CITY and to a home where the family spirit dominates every activity end the word"orphan"seems to lose its meaning.

HANDBOOK
LISTS
35, 000
opportunities
for study
abroad
FOR many centuries the thirst for
knowledge has led men across
the world's frontiers. In Europe
there was a time when Bologna
attracted law students from many
lands, when Montpellier was famous as
an international centre for medical
learning and when a course of study
in one of the Italian art schools was
considered by Flemish and Dutch pain-
ters as an essential part. of their
training.
Today, studies abroad are recognized
not only as a means of attaining know-
ledge or technical skills, but also as a
useful way to promote international
understanding. The student, teacher or
artisan who travels to another country
comes to know more than just another
school, university or factory ; he learns
by personal experience about other
people and their ways of life, and has
the chance to act as an unofficial am-
bassador for h s own country.
Recognizing the possibilities for
mutual understanding provided by the
exchange of persons for educational
purposes, Unesco grants and adminis-
ters fellowships, and each year pu-
blishes a handbook :"Study Abroad,
International Handbook of Fellowships,
Scholarships and Educational Ex-
change."
The purpose of this publication its
firstly, to provide documentation to
assist agencies engaged in administer-
ing fellowship programmes. It is
hoped that. by showing the scope of
current international fellowship pro-
grammes, areas of outstanding need
and possible overlapping of initiatives
in certain study fields will be empha-
sized.
Secondly, it aims to make known to
one another the agencies in different
countries which administer similar
types of programmes in order to encou-
rage international contacts and to
promote increased fellowship program-
mes ; and thirdly, to publicise more
widely the opportunities open to can-
didates for study, research and obser-
vation abroad in order to encourage
more equitable distribution of awards,
and, by increasing the number of can-
didates, to improve the quality of
scholars selected for study abroad.
Fellowships Doubled
IN 1948, the first edition gave infor-mation on 16, 000 fellowships grant-
ed by 37 countries. The second
edition, covering 1949-50, gave
information on 24, 000 fellowsh-ps
granted by 49 countries 26 non-auto-
nomous territories, and the United Na-
tions and specialized agencies. A sup-
plement, published in 1950, gave a new
list of 500 summer study courses,
tours, etc., organized during university
vacations in 16 countries.
The third and latest edition of
"Study Abroad", covering 1950-51, has
just been published. Extensive research
by Unesco and the growth of certain
programmes such as the Fullbright
programme developed by the United
States, have enabled a list to be made
of approxinutely 35, 000 opportunities
for men and women in all parts of the
world to study a wide range of sub-
jects.
The University of Puerto Rico, for
instance. offers a scholarship to male
students of the Caribbean region, not
including Puerto R : co ; age over 16 ; to
pursue vocational studies in the
School of Industrial Arts of the Uni-
versity. The New Zealand Government
offers a fellowship to nationals of
Burma, Indonesia, Malaya and Thai-
land for a six months'study course in
New Zealand on any one of the fol-
lowing subjects : animal husbandry,
agriculture, wool research, social wel-
fare, pre-natal care, state medical care,
native education, mining, teacher train-
ing, technical aspects of broadcasting.
The French Committee of the Inter-
national Student Service offers a fel-
lowship for a period of ten months,
to refugee students in France ; prefe-
rence given to students who have
almost completed their studies ; unres-
tricted choie of any university course.
"Workers Abroad"
ONE of the important and developingfeatures in programmes of
exchange, published in the present
issue of"Study Abroad", concerns op-
portunities for employees in various
trades, industries and professions.
These facilities, outlined in a report
by the International Labour Office,
show how such people can work abroad
for a limited period to improve their
linguistic and occupational competence.
The Report covers (1) legal measures
adopted by 18 countries for the issue
of labour permits to foreign trai-
nees (2) details of specific program-
mes for the inter-change of workers
organized by trade and professional
associations.
During 1951, three supplements to
"Study Abroad"will be published. The
first,"Workers Abroad"will contain
information on scholarships and travel
grants for workers and short-term cul-
tural and educational exchange pro-
grammes for workers. This supple-
ment, additional to the chapter already
written on this subject in"Study
Abroad"will give the findings of an
enquiry conducted by Unesco in co-
operation with the International
Labour Office.
The second supplement will deal with
the inter-change of teachers and short-
term appointments abroad for teachers
and professors. As last year, the third
and final supplement will give infor-
mation on vacation study courses and
special study tours.

ELIZABETH BLACKWELL
To-day there are thousands of women
doctors to care for the sick, but a
hundred years ago there was possibly
only once who had formally qualified.
Elizabeth Blackwell was born in England
en 3rd February 1821 and later emigrated
to the United States with her family.
Miss Blackwell wa. > in charge of a school
when she had occasion to nurse a
woman friend, who deplored the fact
that there were no wcmen doctors.
Elizabeth Blackwell's vocation was
henceforth clear. Overcoming prejudice
and opposition, she attended lectures
and in 1849 reached the final stage whe : J.
her the3is was accented. Beginning In
the United States, she later practised In
England, always making the poorest
families her first care. The two hospi-
tals which she founded In New York and
In London did muoh to advance public
hygiene.
THOMAS CARLYLE
He became famous 1 : 1 his 42nd year
when his History of the French Revo-
lotion was published In 1837 ; famous but
never popular and seldom understood.
Coming from a working-class famlly, he
knew long years of poverty and always
Identified himself with the working
classes. His approach to religion was
considered sacrilegious by his contempo-
raries. Hstile to all dogmas and doc-
trines, he attacked both the sceptics and
the materialists. God was a God of
Nature, he declared, ma : 1lfestlng him-
self In the history of mankind. When
Carlyle died on 4th February 1881, he
left disciples behind who called them-
selves"radicals", sometimes"mystics"
and among whom the most devoted was
John Buskin.
LINCOLN'S LEAVE-TAKING
Ninety years ago, Abraham Lincoln
left the town of Springfield, Missouri, to
assume the Presidency of the United
States. On the loth February, the Pre-
sident said goodbye to the town whioh
he was never to see again :"I now leave...
with a task before me greater than that
which rested upon Washington-
without the assistance of that Divine
Being who ever attended him, I cannot
succeed,"When his train reached Phi-
ladelphia. Lincoln learned of the exis-
tence of a conspiracy : already there
were those seeking to assassinate him.
In the hall where the fathers of his
country once formulated the Declaration
of Independence, Abraham Lincoln
spoke of Equality,"If this country
cannot be saved without giving up that
principle... I would rather be assassinat-
ed on this spot than surrender it."It
was not till five years later that Lin-
coln was assassinated, but by that time,
thanks to him, one of history's great
victories for human rights-abolition
of slavery in the U. S,-had been won.
He was born on
25th February 1841 ;
one year after Mon-
net, two years after
Cezanne, the same
year as Berthe Mori-
sot and Armamd
Gui1laumln, Van
Gogh, Georges Seu-
rat were soon to fol-
low. This group of
artists were to pro-
Ject the never-end-
ing debates about the meaning and
value of Impressionism, Post-Impression-
ism and"MOdern Art"in general,
They were accused of painting urrea-
lity-the critics presuming to know
what was reality. Renoir, like his com-
panions, was indifferent to praise or
blame. He kept on painting landscapes
vibrant with warmth and perfume ; and
his bathing goddesses, the models for
which were only pretexts,"Any models
will do", he used to say,"provided they
don't block the tight... I use models only
as a starting point to attempt thing.
that I could not otherwise invent."
THE FIGHT AGAINST
YELLOW FEVER
Fifty years ago, there was little defence
against Yel10w Fever-"pest of the
tropics"-and the only precautionary
measure taken was to quarantine sh1p5
from Central America. At the end of
the 19th century, thousands of people
had died in Rio de Janeiro, in New
Orleans. Lisbon and Barcelona. Experts
began research. In 1900 an American
commission, basing its research on thr
discoveries of a Cuban scientist, Dr. Fin-
lay, determined that the infection
carrier was a mosquito resembl ! ng the
malarial pest. Successful counter-
measures were first undertaken in
Havana, on 27th February 1901 when
medical teams began the methodical
destruction of larvae in the streams,
reservoirs and catchment areas of the
town. From January 1902, Havana was
never again troubled by the dread Yel-
low Fever.
FENG TAO
A thousand years ago a book was
printed in Korea for the first time. This
Buddhist text was no translation from
Sanskrit but written directly in Chinese ;
and it marked the beginning of a cul-
tural renaissance that the Far East
owed mainly to one remarkable man :
Feng Tap. Born in 881 in the province
of Tchili, Feng Tao, first minister under
seven successive emperors, Is credited by
traditbn with the Invention of print-
ing. He played clearly no part in the
technical discovery, but he spent all his
life in promoting and developing the
use of print. In 932 he prepared, and
printed the first official edition of the
classics in 130 volumes and these works
became known throughout the empire.
Feng Tao can rightly be called the
Father of the Confucian Renaissance
which reached its height in the 12th
century and posterity can be grateful to
him for the magnificent printed vol-
umes which remain one of the glories
of the Sung dynasty.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 16 FEBRUARY 1951
MEXICO'S"SCHOOLS
WITHOUT WALLS"
TEACH THE LESSON
OF SELF-HELP
Hundreds of thousands of Mexican
t-) who live in rural areas, not only
far from the big towns but also
lacking most of the material ele-
ments of ordinary modern well-being,
are being slowly but surely heaped
toward the achievement of better per-
sonal and communal standards of living
and working.
The improvement Is being brought
about through the work of 48 rural mis-
sions which the Mexican Government
sent out ton 146 remote zones, with a
combined population of 540, 000, under
its remarkable Cultural Mission Pro-
gramme. First launched In 1923, then
re-established on a broader and firmer
basis in 1942, and further developed
during the last few years, this pro-
gramme works on the fundamental
principle of adult education that the
people should be helped to help them-
selves to solve their problems.
Some of the major achievements of
the rural missions are described in
"The i1lexican Culluml Mission P,'o-
gramme,"an 80-page booklet, written
by Lloyd H. Hughes, and recently pu-
blished bY Unesco as the third in its
series of monographs on Fundamental
Education. 1r. Hughes, who was sent
to Mexico by Unesco in the summer of
1949. sets forth in detail the story of
the evolution of fundamental education
in Mexico during the thirty years since
the battle cry"tierra y escuelas" (land
and schools) resounded throughout the
land until it reached the ears of the
remotest Indians.
His conclusion on the basis of a care-
ful studv of the rural missions'work
in 1948 and 1949 is"that slightly sunder
45 % of the people living in zones where
missions hare worked haL'e benefited
from the cultural mission projects and
activities."
Ending Rural Isolation
"T lie cultural missions,"J1fr, Hug liesdeclare ,.. have contributed
greatly to tlre overcuming oj the
physical and mental isolation in which
tile'campesino'and tile Indian live ;
they ?//iafe also given rural communi'ies
a sense of inlerdependence and relation-
ship with the rest of tile population. in
this ! I ; ay they hrwe contributed to the
triumph of nationalism over regionalism
and localism,
.. Frequently, as in Los Reyes de Jail-
re=. a village near Tepeaca in the S'r ; te
of Puebla, they ha'e checked'L'illage
and inter-villaue l'ivalries and promoted
co-operation to solve joint problems.
They have also made the'campesi-
nos'better producers and consumers
through the introduction of new crops
and bet'per domestic anim2ls, techniques
of production and diet.
"The set'ere tasks of rural 7, L'omen
have been lightened through the intro-
duction of communal"molinos de nix-
tamal" (corn mills) and ! sewing mac/t-
ines, and through a distribution of chore, 
among all able members of the family.
'Campesinos,'especially Indians, have
been encouraged to consult doctors and
to use modern medicines. The intro-
duction off recreation programmes and
music has given a new orientation to na-
tional and local festivals and helped to
overcame the problem of alcoholism in
many areas."
Eighteen of the missions work in
Federal eapital. Tile programme also
includes the use of a number of moto-
rized and cinematographic missions.
Leaders Of Change
During 1948-1949 the rural missionsconcentrated on improvement of
economy and health ; improvement
of the home and domestic life ; develop-
ment of sound recreational and cultural
activities ; material improvement of ru-
ral communities. Most of the teams in-
cluded a home economics leader, a nurse
and midwife, an agriculture teacher, a
construction teacher, a trades teacher, a
mechanics teacher and a leader of re-
creational activities.
In general, stress was put on agri-
cultural improvement, such as the in-
troduction of new crops and new meth-
ods of farming. A grafting campaign
was sponsored during which thousands
of shoots, mostly of fruit trees, contra--
buted by growers in Sierra Norte de
Puebla and Amanalco de Becerra, were
employed.
In the vicinity of Hueyapan and Yao-
nahuac, Puebla, extremely good results
were obtained in convincing farmers to
use chemical fertilizers to increase
yields. Tiie missions'teachers of agri-
culture taught large numbers of far-
mers in many regions how to vaccinate
their poultry ; they imported blooded
fowl from the United States to improve
creole varieties ; and they demonstrated
building of brooder houses.. Improved
methods of livestock raising and breed-
ing, and the development of local small
industries were also taught. In Nati-
vitas, Tlaxcala and Hueyapan, Morelos,
classes in small industries were orga-
nised as well as producers'co-oper-
atives to market their products. The
building of dams, rain-water reservoirs
and small irrigation canals was pro-
moted and farmers were shown how
to prevent soil erosion.
A Better Home Life
one of the major activities, Mr. Hu-ghes points out, was"to help raise
the moral standards o (the poople
by teaching affection and consideration
for mother, the protection of woman
and children, and a more equitable dis-
tribution o (chores among all members
o (the (amily. Classes in child care, no-
trition, cooking and sewing were orga-
nized (or young women and mothers."
ART HELPS EDUCATION. Mission teachers in plastic arts try to assls'me growth
of the social campaign through stimulating pictures. This painting, for example, has for
subject the literacy campaign.
The missions all co-operated with the
Government's literacy campaign, main-
taining 125 schools and encouraging
town and village authorities and par-
ents'societies to raise the very low sal-
aries of teachers. In many towns
reading rooms and small libraries were
established for the use of newly literate
readers and one, at Santiago Ixcuintla,
now has 5, 000 books.
The greatest lack, : \11'. Hughes found,
was of personnel trained to serve suc-
cessfullv as members of missions.
This situation, not limited to Mexico, is
one of the reasons which has led
Unesco to set up a centre for the train-
ing of fundamental education teachers,
for Latin America. (See Pages 8 and 9
of this tissue.) This centre is being
established in Mexico where students
from many countries of Latin America
will stud' methods of Fundamental
Education'under an international sta1l
including Mexican experts. Their field
studY will take them into Mexican
communities, where they will be able to
study at first hand the work of the
Mexican Cultural Missions.
