FROM THE UNESCO NEWS ROOM...
* Korea : Libraries in Korea will soon
be receiving the first shipment of a total
of 50, 000 new books which are being
purchased for them by the United
Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency
under a book replacement programme
for educational institutions that lost
most of their school supplies and equip-
ment as a result of military operations.
The book programme was undertaken
with the help of Unesco which sent a
planning mission to Korea.
* Belgium : The 12th annual Belgian
International Art Week organized by
the country's Ministry of Education will
begin on July 30. This enables visitors
from many countries to inspect, under
expert guidance, Belgium's ancient and
modern art treasures. This year eight
countries are organizing similar"Arts
Weeks"in collaboration with the Bel-
gian authorities.
* Netherlands : Though still struggling
to regain land lost to the sea in the
recent floods, the Netherlands continues
to supply experts to help other coun-
tries. A group of Dutch engineers and
technicians has just planned a ten-year
scheme for Syria that will turn about
seventy-five thousand acres of marsh-
land in Northwest Syria into a fertile
agricultural region capable of support-
ing sixty thousand people.
* Mexico : The first exhibition on the
history of books and engravings in
Mexico is being organized with the co-
operation of both official and private
cultural organizations. The exhibition
will record the impressive development
of book production and engraving in
this country, from the time the first
printing press was introduced to Mexico
until today.
* Italy : The island of San Giorgio,
opposite the Piazza di San Marco in
Venice, is being transformed into an
international centre of culture and the
arts. Artists and scholars from many
nations will be able to stay in a guest
home in San Giorgio's famous abbey.
Two modern schools have also been
built for children from the poorest
Venetian families. Buildings are being
transformed into a hostel for Italian
and foreign students. An amphitheatre
to seat 1, 400 spectators is being built for
special theatrical performances.
* Pakistan : In the past during mon-
soon storms, lightning has many times
struck radio transmission lines at Dacca,
East Pakistan, cutting off broadcasts for
several days. Now Mr. S. A. Azziz,"Radio
Pakistan's"research engineer, and
Mr. W. C. Lee (New Zealand), a Unesco
technical assistance expert, have
installed"protection tubes"which
prevent electrical charges from being
built up on cables during these storms.
Radio listeners now hope to enjoy
uninterrupted broadcasts throughout the
monsoon season.
* Ireland : Art critics from many
nations are to meet in Dublin this
month for the Forth International
Congress of Art Critics. The Congress
will deal with matters of professional
interest, and at the same time will study
the relationship of a work of art to the
culture of its time, the relations bet-
ween art and science, and also art cri-
ticism through the medium of films.
* Burma : British books are now reach-
ing people in even the most isolated
parts of Burma thanks to a book-box
scheme which the British Council has
introduced to widen its library services
in this South East Asian country. From
the British Council library in Rangoon
boxes of books go out by rail, river and
sea on five routes dividing the country
into regions, each of which has four or
five stations or borrowing points.
* Portugal : The Portuguese Govern-
ment has launched a vigorous campaign
against illiteracy-a campaign that may
affect as much as forty per cent of
the population. Primary education will
be compulsory for all children between
seven and thirteen. Army recruits are
to. be released from service only after
completing educational courses. More-
over, beginning in 1955, no company will
be allowed to hire personnel who failed
to complete their primary schooling.
Government courses are being organized
* France : Children's literature usually
is written by adults, selected by adults
and published by adults, but a new
French literary jury will give the chil-
dren themselves an important voice in
the matter. The jury, which will award
a prize for the best children's book of
1953, will be made up of ten youngsters
between the ages of ten and fourteen
from primary and secondary schools in
Paris and the suburbs.
* Unesco : More than twelve thousand
publications received as gifts and
exchange offerings from governments,
libraries, publishers and private indivi-
duals were distributed through Unesco's
Clearing House for Publications to
libraries in fifty-five countries during
the second half of last year. Nine
thousand additional volumes were
exchanged by libraries among them-
FRANCE TO APPLY UNESCO"FREE FLOW"AGREEMENT
France has put into effect the Unesco-sponsorec/international Agreement which
abolishes import c/uties on a wide range of ec/ucational, scientific anc/cultural materials.

throughout the country for both chil-
dren and adults.
* Venezuela : Local authorities of the
important oil town of Maracaibo have
decided to organize a system of school
by radio for children unable to leave
their homes. The radio courses later
will be extended to adults who cannot
attend evening schools. A special ma-
nual is being prepared to instruct the
teachers who will be responsible for the
broadcasts.
* Denmark : The Danish International
Student Committee is again organizing
international archaeological work camps
this year lasting three weeks. These will
be held at Fyrkat, near Hobro in Jutland,
where students will help the Danish
National Museum excavate a viking
fortress, and on the island of Bornhold
where they will work on a fortress dat-
ing from the Iron Age, and rebuilt in
the Middle Ages, and on some Early
Iron Age habitations. Students will be
supervised by archaeologists from the
National Museum, and will visit places
of historical interest.
* Israel : The first of many Israeli
international work camps planned for
1953 has now ended. For two weeks,
volunteers from Switzerland, the United
States and Great Britain joined with
fifteen Israelis and Arabs to construct
terraces, gardens and playgrounds at a
Village Home for young delinquents.
The work camp idea was introduced
with great success in Israel last summer.
selves, following encouragement from
Unesco.
* Nepal : The Government of Nepal has
signed and deposited the instrument of
acceptance of the constitution of Unesco,
thus becoming officially Unesco's sixty-
seventh Member State. Nepal's applic-
ation for membership had been approv-
ed by Unesco's general conference at
its Seventh session in Paris last Novem-
ber.
* Yugoslavia : More than two hundred
Yugoslav students will engage in special
studies abroad this year, while one
hundred and forty foreign students visit
Yugoslavia under a recent agreement
with the International Association for
the Exchange of Students. The Yugo-
slav students are to spend from two
to four months in one or several of
eleven countries.
* International : On June 1st, an
international agreement sponsored by
the International Labour Organization
came into force granting social security
benefits to forty-five thousand barge-
men on Europe's Rhine river. Under
the agreement, signed by Germany,
France, Belgium, Holland and Switzer-
land, the barge-men and their families
will receive benefits no matter in which
country they find themselves-and
whatever the flag under which they are
sailing.
* United Kingdom : This month the
British pharmaceutical industry will
adopt the metric system for weights
and measures. By doing so, it will sim-
plify the present system and bring it
into line with measurements used by
scientists in most other countries.
* United Nations : The United Nations
Postal Administration has issued a
commemorative stamp honouring the
work of the Universal Postal Union.
The new stamp's design shows a globe
with an envelope superimposed. * The
emblem of the United Nations appears
in the middle and the abbreviation
"UPU"at the lower right.
* Norway : King Haakon of Norway
has opened a nation-wide campaign to
finance Norway's new Aid to India
scheme. The project involves technical
assistance to India, under a three-way
agreement between the United Nations
and the Governments of Norway and
India. Funds will first be used to send
experts and equipment to help modernize
fisheries in the Indian state of Travan-
core-Cochin. The United Nations will
also contribute assistance.
* Austria : An international congress
for the professional training of musi-
cians will take place this month in Bad
Aussee and Salzburg. Some eighty
directors of conservatories, universities
and music academies in many countries
will participate in the congress. They
will strive to co-ordinate the different
methods of musical education and to
elaborate what would be an ideal peda-
gogic programme in the realm of music.
* United Nations : Sculptures to deco-
rate the outdoor site of the United
Nations building in New York are being
sought by the Organization. Though
many gifts have been received for the
interior of the Headquarters, only two
statues have so far been given to stand
in the grounds. One is Greece's gift
of a statue of Zeus, and the other a
sculpture in wood of a young girl from
Denmark. Two more outdoor sites have
been prepared for stone statuary and so
far only one offer has been received-
Yugoslavia has promised a Bronze eques-
trian statue.
* Haiti : As a preliminary to a major
plan for agricultural development in
the Valley of Artibonita, the Govern-
ment of Haiti has launched a demons-
tration project"Bois Dehors", for the
rational exploitation of more than, 1, 500
acres of land, which will be devoted to
cultivation of rice, vegetables, pasture
and kenaf. To stimulate the co-opera-
tive spirit of the farmers, adult educa-
tion, sports, educational films, as well
as all types of recreational and social
activities are given a prominent place
in the programme. The results obtained
have already shown the strength of the
farmers'determination to improve their
way of life, according to the authorities.
* International : Under a five-year
international Art Exchange programme,
the work of modern artists will be exhi-
bited in many parts of the world.
Thanks to this programme, financed by
a grant from the Rockefeller Brothers
Fund, American painters and sculptors
will be able to show their work in Pans,
Tokyo and Sao Paulo, Brazil : whilst
exhibitions of Japanese architecture and
contemporary Italian architecture and
design will be shown at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.

DANGERS IN TECHNICAL CHANGE
ALL the great civilizations of the world arehybrids. No matter how far back we go in
history we find that most of the changes
that have taken place, even in the most primitive
civilizations, have had their roots in contacts with
other peoples. The greatest civilizations have
been those which were flexible enough to absorb
the largest possible number of foreign techniques
and ideas.
But whereas in the past changes were, as a
rule, slow and new techniques were blended
harmoniously into the existing order of things
without causing serious upheavals, the changes
in our time are more brutal and the repercussions
swifter and deeper. Instead of the former
harmonious process of evolutionary change we
are witnessing revolutionary changes brought
about by the engulfing sweep of modern techno-
logy.
In the past 500 years, the rhythm of technical
progress has been amazingly accelerated with the
rapid development of the means of commu-
nication. And today, our industrial civilization
is reaching out into every hidden corner of the
globe.
The United Nations programme of Technical
Assistance is a systematic attempt, on an in-
ternational scale, to bring to the economically
unfavoured countries the technical knowledge
and methods that will enable them to raise their
standard of living and to share in the progress
of the highly industrialized countries.
The present gap between the living standards
of the industrialized and the under-developed
countries is a threat to peace. Not only does it
encourage an inclination to rebel, but the poverty
prevalent in large areas of the world is a handicap
to the more fortunate countries in that their level
of production is directly affected by the economic
weakness of potential customers.
The changes that Technical Assistance seeks to
achieve in the under-developed countries has been
defined as"a cumulative process where agri-
cultural improvements, health, education, social
measures and industrialization are introduced in
a gradual interplay".
The promoters of Technical Assistance are fully
aware that economic development is bound to
affect all aspects of a people's life to varying
degrees. Food, health and education are the
main fields in which they wish to introduce
changes and they are persuaded that"given a
wide and equitable distribution of its benefits, it
is likely to result in a substantial increase in the
security of the individual and in social stability".
But there is one basic principle which must
guide all forms of planned economic development.
It is an extremely delicate one ; it amounts to
guiding the transition from one form of culture
to another in order to avert the disastrous
consequences that many countries of the world
have suffered from such changes in the past.
This is the task which the U. N. Technical
Assistance Programme has now begun to allot to
the social scientist.
Progress, in the form in which the United
Nations seeks to propagate it throughout the
world, must inevitably destroy many forms of
local culture still surviving on several continents.
These cultures have their defects, no doubt, but
they are none the less the outcome of a long
adaptation to local conditions, and their followers
find in them a satisfaction for which even the
most advanced technology cannot always com-
pensate. The members of a village community
often enjoy a measure of protection that they
will lose when swamped in a proletarian society.
The leisurely well-ordered rhythm of country life
has all too often been replaced by joyless, soul-
deadened toil.
We have learnt by now that no culture has
succeeded in bringing into play all the poten-
tialities of human nature, and that some of the
humblest forms of culture have solved problems
that baffled the more highly developed. Higher
standards of living, industrialization-these will
inevitably destroy such values and thus tend
towards the impoverishment of the human race.
The choice lies not between guns and butter,
FEW of us change long-stranding habits very easily. Even in a highly-industrialized country where changes from the old to
the new are constantly taking place, it takes a good while before people accept these changes. In non-indus-
trialized countries, where changes are usually much slower, it is not surprising that resistance tc change is even more
deeply-rooted.
Today, under the Technical Assistance Programme of the United Nations and various governmental and voluntary
agencies, great transformations are taking place in the life of millions of people in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
New techniques to increase food production and conserve resources, new methods of nutrition, new health practices, new
education-all of these are being introduced into communities whose way of life has, more often than not, changed little
and slowly for hundreds of years.
This rather sudden impact of technological change has posed critical human problems to technical assistance xperts
working around the world. They have come to realize that it is not enough to move into a country with tractors and
bags of fertilizers and simply tell the people to use them if they want better crops. The reasons why these people have
done things in their own way must first be understood and respected. If they are not respected, then the natural
resistance to change and interference will only be strengthened.
So a new aspect of Technical Assistance is taking on supreme importance. This is the study of a people's culture
- by which the social scientist and the anthropologist mean not only religion and philosophy and the arts, but the small
intimate customs of daily life, how people cook and eat their food, how they manage their children and run their homes.
Cultural anthropology and the other branches of the social sciences have much to offer for the guidance of the
technical assistance xpert, for his task is not only to transfer knowledge but to have it take root. Unesco has now
published such a guide-an absorbing study called"Cultural Patterns and Technical Change", edited by Dr. Margaret Mead,
the noted anthropologist and psychologist, and prepared by a team of social scientists in co-operation with the World
Federation of Mental Health.
Although primarily designed for the technical assistance xpert, the new volume makes fascinating reading for the
layman. (It will be available end of August at Unesco Sales Agents at $2 ; 11/6d ; 550 Fr. Frs). On the following pages
we are happy to be able to present highlights from a few of the chapters of this book.
Dr. Alfred Metraux, of the Social Sciences Department of Unesco which is devoting increased attention to the human
problems of technical change in under-developed countries, speaks out frankly and bluntly, below, ith an anthropologist's
view of some of the dangers which he personally sees if the human problems involved in technical assistance are not
clearly understood and taken into account.
by Dr. Alfred Metraux
but between butter and certain forms of art,
certain religious or philosophical traditions. The
danger of standardization is largely theoretical,
for it must be remembered that requests for
technical assistance and fundamental education
are being received from countries where de-
velopment is in full swing and which have to a
great extent broken with their past traditions.
No reasonable person could suppose that it
would be possible to turn vast areas of the world
into preserves for the protection of native cultures.
Even if, for sentimental reasons, we might wish
to do so, the representatives of the cultures
concerned would undoubtedly be the first to wish
to escape from their traditional way of life and
to denounce our efforts as unjust and dis-
criminatory. It must be remembered that the
initial impetus towards change and development
comes from the governments and peoples of the
under-developed countries.
And they are travelling along the path of
progress faster than their advisers had expected.
Many are trying to go ahead too quickly-at a
dangerous rate. If any attempt is made to check
them, they raise the cry of'''reaction'', or assert
that they are being made the victims of a sinister
imperialism. Heads of missions find that one of
their most difficult problems is to restrain ill-
timed enthusiasm and curb the impulse towards
premature innovation.
Nowadays H is the most highly cultivated
representatives of the coloured races who protest
most vehemently when white men advise them to
maintain their traditional customs. They even
tend to regard anthropologists as the agents of
an insidious imperialism which, under the cloak
of respect and affection, is striving to perpetuate
its supremacy and to debar the coloured races
from all access to power and happiness.
It cannot be denied, however, that too high a
price is often paid for the introduction of in-
dustrialism, and this might perhaps be avoided.
The impact of mechanization is appalling in its
levelling-down effect. Anyone who has ever
visited a mining camp or a sugar cane plantation
can bear witness to the degradation brought
about by the transfer from the tribal way of life
to that of the hired labourer.
Our own society has passed through a similar
crisis, and, the wiser for our experience, we might
perhaps be able to save other cultures from
making the same mistakes and enduring the same
sufferings as ourselves. When the transformation
is on a vast scale, the original culture may be
shaken to its foundations or even destroyed. As
Dr. Bowles so aptly remarks :
"The tragedy lies, not in the disappearance of
a culture, it lies in the replacement of a
functioning society with a mass of disunited in-
dividuals who, as victims of circumstance, can
fall easy prey to exploitation of one sort or
another."
It all too frequently happens that the plans
made for assisting economically backward peoples
make no allowance for the tastes and feelings of
those who are to benefit from the so-called im-
provements. Economists and technicians, because
they deal in statistics and handle practical
problems, become imbued with an alarming self-
confidence. They seldom have any inkling of the
relationship that exists between the various
institutions of a group and fail to realize that its
culture cannot be altered piecemeal.
It requires the experience and acquired instinct
of the anthropologist to foresee what re-
percussions any slight change may have on a
society as a whole. It is the far-reaching
consequences of an apparently desirable reform
which, when perceived by the members of a
particular society, give rise to opposition for
which the technicians and economists can find
no explanation. Hygiene and literacy are not in
themselves a source of happiness and prosperity.
On the contrary they may even, in certain cases,
have a disintegrating effect.
Any educational system which is not suited to
a particular form of culture will tend to un-
dermine its intellectual and moral foundations,
replacing them by standards which are not its
own. As a result we find these groups of uprooted
maladjusted individuals, who are a dead weight
and a danger to peoples at the transitional stage
of culture.
All changes imposed from without, even when
supported by a central government, inevitably
meet with opposition, varying in intensity from
one country, background and social class to
another. The apathy for which foreign experts
so often blame indigenous workers is due in many
instances to a latent antagonism which remains
hidden until, suddenly intensified, it breaks out in
open revolt.
Indifference may also result from a lack of in-
centives. Customs and institutions which to us
seem harmful and incompatible with our
conception of human happiness may nevertheless
represent, to the members of certain groups, a
source of satisfaction for which they are given no
substitute. This applies particularly to im-
provements that require a period of years in
which to make themselves felt.
No change will be accepted, or produce a lasting
effect, unless it is based on a system of values.
The chief task of the anthropologist in technical
assistance programmes will be to discover the
psychological motives underlying customary
behaviour. If a culture is to be transformed, the
innovations introduced, while meeting the wishes
of individuals, must not clash with attitudes
deeply rooted in that culture.

oASHOT ! N THE ARM
FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT
IN many cultures throughout the world manis continuous with his environment. He is not
healthy unless his environment is"healthy,"
or, conversely, the well-being of his environment
depends upon his acts. For example, a bereaved
Kgatla spouse of a fruitful union needs purifica-
tion before he can step on the earth because his
tread scorches the ground ; he injures the people,
the cattle, the crops, and causes a drought.
To break connection between the body and the
land that is continuous with it may be hazardous
or disastrous, irrespective of whether the people
are sedentary or not, whether they depend on
"the fruits of the earth"through agriculture.
This continuity is expressed in a wide range of
ways, from the Eskimo desire to die where he
was born to the belief of the cattle raising Nuer
that if a man permanently settles away from
tribal land he will get sick unless he takes some
earth with him to drink in water mixed with
gradually increasing amounts of new land. The
distance a man will travel for treatment may
depend on which is more hazardous, lack of treat-
ment or continuity with his land.
Again, the body is continuous with the other
bodies of the social unit, and in this lies the
strength and the weakness of the unit, inasmuch
as when one body suffers, it exposes the whole
unit to danger.
Western medicine has a name for this : it calls
it contagion and explains it scientifically. The
medicine of other groups recognizes a different
order of contagion or pollution, and acts accord-
ing to a different conception. So the Australian
Murngin will psychologically cut off any one of
their members who is known to have been magi-
cally attacked ; they stop treating him in terms
of his place in the balanced system of structured
roles ; the mother does not act as his mother,
the brother does not relate himself to the man
who is magically stricken as his brother. The
stricken one is"isolated,"and the social unit
thus protects itself against his contagion. Such
a conception of continuity of body with land
and society underlies the way in which medical
treatment and hygienic measures are accepted
and worked out.
The image of the body depends to some extent
on these concepts of continuity. In many socie-
ties it has no sharp boundaries. Different parts
of the body may be stressed in forming the link
of continuity. In Greek culture, for example,
lineal continuity with the descendant is envi-
sioned as a continuity of the internal organs, the
splanchna, and"compassion"in Greek is derived
from this word. A mother, ready to do anything
for her child, will say,"He is my splanchna."
The lateral relationship, however, is one of blood :
my sister is"my blood,"and blood brotherhood
is reported to have been created between friends,
at least until recently, in remote sections. The
organs of communication, the windows of the
soul, are the eyes among the Greeks, and also
among the Russians, as well as in Latin America.
In Mediterranean countries and the Middle East
evil flows through the eyes when an individual
admires and covets.
Certain parts of the body are often more highly
charged with emotion than others. We find
many regions, in the Middle East, the Far East,
and the Pacific Islands, where the head is extre-
mely important, often sacred. It may have to
be covered, or there may be regulations against
allowing anyone to step over it, or even over the
shadow of another's head.
It is not here our intention to list all the
differences in the emotional weighting of parts
of the body, but to point out that these exist and
should be taken in consideration in the appli-
cation of health measures. For example, if a
treatment is to be applied to feet and the head,
it might be expedient to introduce it through
tampering with the less valued area first. If
skin is to be grafted and it is unavoidable that
it be applied from the lesser to the higher area,
this differential in value should at least be
known to the worker. The advantages of cutting
off the hair should probably be weighed against
the disadvantages resulting from doing so.
In many societies the body is not considered
A patient in England submits calmly to special"wind tunnel"test for loss of salt from body by temperature
variations. In technologically advanced countries people are more accustomed'0 accept innovations in
medical science. In communities less accustomed to change, introducing a new attitude to disease or a
new medical practice can disrupt whole social order and produce deep psychological troubles (COI Photo).
to be complete at birth, Man has to add to it,
to increase it in maleness or femaleness or
potency or effectiveness, or sheer adequacy. In
Burma a girl traditionally could reach woman-
hood only when her ears were pierced. To be
truly male, a boy was tattooed between knees and
navel. The body of its own accord was not
completely potent ; many Burmese and people
from the hill tribes inserted coins and other
charms under the skin to enhance the person.
In Africa and Oceania the teeth had to be
filed or knocked out or broken or blackened,
before the body was complete. In many parts of
the world, the body had to be scarified and some
foreign substance rubbed in. This completion
was not, however, for the body itself alone, but
also symbolized the continuity with the social
unit.
The'a) arm c ! ock'
that buzzed
IN certain cultures clothing seems necessary tothe completion of the body. A Greek village
girl may never see her naked body, and may
never try to see her naked baby. She delights in
the clothed baby, and particularly in festive array
with embroideries and jewels. Petal skin or rosy
cheeks have no part in her lullabies or dirges ;
she sings of costly silks and jewels, and of the
festive trappings of the young brave.
In many parts of the world, clothing is not
"shelter"as it is classified by Western society, but
personal enhancement, even completion. For
thirty years missionaries among the Chagga tried
to introduce change in their clothing habits, so
as to combat the scourge of respiratory diseases,
without any success. The Chagga said that
these diseases came from evil spirits, and that
clothing had nothing to do with them, since its
function was that of adornment.
These are some of the concepts relating to the
body which are relevant to the introduction of
health measures, either in the field of medicine
or that of hygiene. Hygiene, in one definition,
tells people what they should do and tries to
prevent the spread of disease. Medical care has
as its purpose the relief of suffering and tells
people what they should not do.
The two fields, however, often overlap. It is
difficult, for example, to place the DDT
campaign in either category exclusively. Under-
taken under medical auspices, it has also
destroyed pests and vermin in the area of
Hygiene. In Iran, a farmer was heard to
complain that it had an adverse effect upon
farming ; the flies, mosquitoes and bedbugs which
had been counted upon to wake the farmers from
their afternoon siesta are now gone, and the
farmers do not wake up in time to put in suffi-
cient work before sunset.
Conceptions of what constitutes cleanliness,
uncleanliness, and dirt vary throughout the
world. In many societies death and. graves are
contaminating, making relatives or people who
handled the dead unclean until they can be
purified or until a certain period of time has
elapsed. It is not safe to assume that, because
a people are given to washing often, they can be
trusted to wash their hands before embarking on
an undertaking which may be highly vulnerable
to infection.
What the eye
doesn't see...
'wtrTHEN villagers in an Iranian village com-plained that their water tasted and smelled
foul, a filter was built for it under the
auspices of the Near East Foundation. The
farmers were told all about the dangerous micro-
organisms and urged to avoid them by drinking
only the filtered water. But they needed no
urging ; they drank of the pure water because it
was cool and clear, and tasted good, though not
because of the absence of micro-organisms. A
variation of this attitude, as Margaret Mead has
pointed out, is prevalent in the United States
where people avoid that which looks or smells or
tastes dirty as unhygienic, whereas actually the
dangerous germs have neither taste nor smell and
are not visible to the naked eye.
Patterned cleanliness, not because cleanliness as
such is important, but as part of a way of life, is
common in many cultures. A good housewife, as
among the Spanish Americans of New Mexico,
may be one who always keeps her house clean ;
the people may always wash themselves, morning
and evening. But among these people, this is
the way to act, part of the aesthetic picture ; it
has nothing to do with hygienic ends. The idea
that a person they love or familiar objects and
surroundings can contaminate them, is rejected
by this group.
In Colombia cleanliness was introduced in the
schools as an aesthetic measure. In Indonesia
and the Pacific Islands there is frequent bathing
by immersion throughout the day, apparently for
refreshment. In Indian villages there are often
tanks where the villagers can immerse themsel-
ves before a meal. The Burmese villager bathes
after the last meal for refreshment and as part
of the ritual of making himself festive for the
amusement of the evening. Burmese wash their
mouths after every meal, the Hos clean their
teeth with a twig every day after their first meal.

A new aspect of Technical Assistance is taking on supreme importance. It is the realization that new techniques must be introduced with proper regard for the
existing culture and with as little violence as possible to the folkways of the groups concerned. In public health it has been discovered repeatedly that innovations in
child and maternal care, hospitalization and the distribution of drug remedies for a disease may have serious effects neither intended nor expected. (COI photo).
Cleanliness, again, may be a ritual, as with
Mohammedans and Jews. Orthodox Jews must
wash out mouth and hands upon arising and
before eating and after elimination ; the hands
must be clean before they help to wash the
mouth. The water must be flowing or must be
poured.
From the viewpoint of other peoples, many
Western habits are dirty. The British, who
regarded the hill tribes of Burma as filthy for
taking almost no baths, were in turn considered
dirty by the Indonesians for bathing only once a
day. Our Western handkerchief used for pock-
eting mucous is found revolting by a number
of other societies.
There has been confusion among people of
Western culture as to the meaning of dirt and
cleanliness, and the extent to which they are
related to hygiene. And where new habits have
been pressed upon other cultures without plan,
they have often reflected this confusion. Cow-
dung, for example, is important in medication
in some groups such as the Kgatla, and in some
Indian villages where it is used in poulticing and
for the treatment of burns. There is no disgust
connected with it, and disgust expressed by a
foreigner may meet strong opposition. Cleanli-
ness in Western culture is often merely an
aesthetic quality, or is associated with virtue,
despite the use of hygiene as a sanction.
Hygienic measures have been directed toward
teaching people cleanly habits, better housing,
better ventilation, and the destruction of vermin :
but the most concentrated attack since the
beginning of this century has been against soil
pollution and water pollution. Where people
eliminated on the surface of the gtound, in no
specific area, and went about barefooted, they
exposed themselves daily to hookworm in many
areas where this is present. Rains washed para-
sites from the excreta into streams and exposed
people to dysentery and other intestinal disor-
ders. Flies settling on exposed excreta carried
disease from person to person. The paramount
need then was for the building of deep pit
latrines.-
The attempt to educate people to the need
for latrines and to persuade them to build
and use them was undertaken by the Rockefeller
Foundation for the Oceanic areas, by the Near
East Foundation for areas in Greece and the
Middle East, and by various governments and
colonial administrations. The need was wide-
spread and still is. In 1948, after fifteen years
of an intermittent campaign for the introduction
of latrines, 98 per cent of the Greek farmers were
reported to be without latrines. And this was in
a country where the only resistance came from
the people's contentment with the habitual and
from seeing no need for change.
It is no easy matter to introduce latrines in
the different regions of the world. Sometimes, as
in the Netherlands Indies. the very idea was so
curious that people could not believe that they
had understood correctly. Sometimes, as in
India, it was ridiculous. With all the space

somatic health.
Among some groups disease is a

around the village, why should the people trouble
themselves to bore holes for latrines ?
The attempt to introduce more hygienic hous-
ing has also met with various resistances. Often
people lived in crowded quarters because they
liked to live that way ; the hope that a better
income would mean better housing for the Mexi-
can villager, for example, or for the Spanish
Americans of New Mexico, was ill-founded. In
Uganda the resistance was based on the religion
of the people and was found to be almost insur-
mountable. Here in many areas the houses have
no windows and very low doorways, admitting
minimal quantities of light and fresh air, and
thus also allowing no opportunity for the working
of the evil eye, which is responsible for all illness,
poverty, and death.
The concepts of health and disease are part of
man's view of the universe and his place within
it. There are people who believe that the good
is normal and inherent, and only man's misdeed,
carelessness or sin allows evil to intrude. Among
some Indian tribes of the southwestern United
States evil, and specifically disease, can enter
when man has allowed his relations with the
universe to become disharmonious, or the loss of
harmony itself is a disease. So, among the Hopi
and the Papago, it is imperative to have good
thoughts, to avoid quarrels and aggressive acts,
for the maintenance of good relations with the

HEALTH MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLES
(Continued from previous page).
punishment for sin, mainly against society ; it was
therefore an important factor in the maintenance
of social order. Among the Saulteaux Indians,
and the Manus of the Admiralties, where con-
fession was necessary before cure could be
effected, disease actually brought to light and
clarified a number of hidden matters. The whole
process of getting ill and being cured was a
mainstay of society. To introduce a new concept
of disease, and penicillin instead of confession, to
people for whom illness has a significant place in
the universal order is often impossible, or
dangerous to psychosomatic health.
It is common to attribute disease to the
machinations of witchcraft, evilly disposed people
or spirits, the evil eye, or blackmailing deities
desiring to be bribed. Weak tsav potency among
the Tiv, a low kan among the Burmese, makes
the individual vulnerable to such attack. Fright
is a major causs of disease in Mitla, and its
effects may be manifested years later. Against
a background of such beliefs, workers found it
hard to introduce hygienic measures.
Attitudes toward treatment rest on the concep-
tion of health and disease. The Navaho may
take treatment to relieve his symptoms, but he
knows he will never b2 truly well until he reco-
vers his harmony with the universe. Where
health is defined as an existing average, not an
ideal to be achieved, much ill health will be
accepted before treatment is sought. Workers
among fellahin in the Middle East found
that trachoma and even partial blind-
ness, were part of the picture of health,
since these things had always been
present and anyway they were from God.
Reports from Latin Americans and
from the Spanish Americans in the
United States indicate that there, too,
the picture of health contains a"normal"
amount of disease. This is the con-
ception among the Tiv where tsav was
needed for super-normal health. It is
the attitude of rural Greeks, who learn
to put up with a certain amount of ill-
health as a matter of course. It is one
which has made the teaching of new
health measures very difficult, since the ;
people have first to be taught to re-
cognize ill-health as abnormal and un-
necessary.
The idea of infection itself frequently
does not have to be taught since it is
present in many cultures, but the agents
of infection, the routes, the kinds of
things which are communicable, are
usually completely different from those
which Western medicine accepts.
There are many kinds of measures
taken for the prevention of the spread of
an infection. To prevent the spread of
death, the home of the dead is often
burned or deserted, and his belongings
buried or destroyed. In many parts of
the world the near relatives of the dead
are isolated, and are not allowed to mix
with others until they have undergone
purification. From the viewpoint of
Western medical practice, these measu-
res often are actually good precautions
when the death was from an infectious
disease.
In many cultures where the individual
is continuous with, his unit, the isolation
of the ill is completely unacceptable.
Dr. Carl Binger reports that when he was
dealing with a typhus epidemic among
the Greeks of Macedonia at the end of
the first World War, the family would
hide its sick under piles of clothing or in
the cellar rather than show them to a
physician who might take them to a
hospital, though they know that to keep
the sick with them might mean death
for the family. This attitude is reported
4-..... h^,..,....,....""......... 4- i-  Mn'u' ̂ 1",,,"h... i-..."ni--i"""rr- +1-...... 1"10....to be present today also, obstructing t. he campaign
against tuberculosis. People do know the danger
to which they are exposed, but they feel that to
isolate the sick individual, or to take precautions
protecting the rest of the family would be to
reject a member of the family. In West Africa
"the whole family would rather contract disease
and die from it than part with the infected
member."
Spitting out the snake
WHEN a Burmese villager is ill, it is he whoimmediately sends for a physician, for
drugs, for treatment. When a Greek is
ill, he does not exhibit any need for care, does not
go to bed unless he is incapable of standing up,
thus exercising fortitude. When a Navaho is ill, it
is his relatives who decide what is to be done and
make the necessary arrangements. It is not much
use to try to persuade a sick Navaho to go to the
hospital, since it is his family who will actually
make the decision for him. It is cruel to tell a
Greek that he must stay in bed and do nothing
for himself ; it is much kinder to say this to his
wife or other relatives, so that the sick one
should not have to be put in the position of
asking for this pampering.
There are definite patterns of treatment in the
various cultures. Where disease is inflicted by
the intrusion of foreign matter, of spirit arrows
or snakes or fish, sucking is a common form of
treatment. In Papua, native doctors are found
sucking out the spirit of the hookworm and
spitting it out in the form of a miniature snake.
Where there is contact with Western medicine, it
is usual for the native medicine man to be called
first and for the Western practitioner to be
summoned only when all else fails.
Burmese take mainly solids as medicament,
and have solids introduced into the body. The
Navaho depend largely upon anointing, and use a
variety of greases. They use pitch as a sort of
poultice, and when a herbal concoction is used,
it is first rubbed ritually over the body and then
the remains are drunk.
The Western practice of going to bed when ill
is not present everywhere. In some societies,
such as the Zuni, one goes to bed when one is
ready to die. Sending such people to bed may
be very disturbing. The Navaho, used to moving
about freely, find it terribly confining to stay in
bed in the hospital. Where beds consist of mats
on a draughty floor, moreover, they may not be
an ideal place for the ill.
A difficulty encountered in treatment is that
diagnostic measures are often taken as the cure.
In Sikian, in Malaita, and the Cook Islands, it
was found that the use of the stethoscope and
tuberculin injections were considered corrective
measures ; the people could not understand why
they should submit to further treatment. And
in general, one application, whether diagnostic or
curative, was considered a cure, so that in the
tuberculin test, people could not be persuaded to
return for further injections or for inspection.
The Spanish Americans of New Mexico felt that
These New Guinea medical aides take proper precautions against
infection before performing a minor surgical operation, but in many
areas many psychological hurdles must be overcome if modern concepts
of disease, germs and microbes are to be understood and accepted.
(Australian Official Photo.)
an X-ray examination was a cure in itself, and
that there was no need to return to the phy-
sician.
Where illness and health are determined by
ancestors or deities, prevention often takes the
form of periodic rites. When Western practices
are introduced, it is found to be necessary to first
educate people in Western concepts of the
agency of disease. It is very difficult to explain
what we mean by germs and microbes. Dr. Hei-
ser found that people in the Philippines were
ready to attack germs with a bolo, since a germ
represented the enemy.
Workers in India found it effective to present
germs as poison ; this made sense and circum-
vented the neces. sity of determining whether the
germs had true life or not. Control through
elimination of insect carriers met with resistance
in Buddhist societies ; some groups, however, may
agree to destroy life if they are made to do so
by someone who will assume the responsibility.
In the destruction of plague-infested rats we
find that, though such people will be unwilling
to take life, they are ready to abandon a village
until all the rats have been forced to leave, or
they will lift the roofs off their houses so that
the light forces the rats to leave. Africans and
Greeks were delighted with the dramatic elimi-
nation of mosquitoes and vermin which accom-
panied the DDT campaign. Iranian farmers
worried because pests were Godsent, and God
might now send worse ones.
Inoculation and vaccination are sometimes
entirely acceptable. Some societies have the
pattern of introducing potency and resistance to
unless the patient makes some payment.
This conception is quite prevalent, and
may be important in ensuring the
patient's faith in the treatment given by
a Western physician. In Africa the
British administration, attempting to
persuade the people to seek treatment by
making it both valid and free, announced
that the people had already made
payment through their taxes.
People to whom it is important that
the body should be complete, perfect,
find surgery insupportable. The Spanish
Americans of New Mexico resist having
any cut made into the body, and prefer
to deal themselves with such ills as
appendicitis. An operation means that
the body is damaged forever ; they
compare it to a pottery vessel which,
however carefully mended after breaking,
will always present a damaged appear-
ance.
Amputation presents a somewhat dif-
ferent picture. It is not merely surgery ;
it changes the individual into a kind of
cripple, and in many societies the
crippled are despised, or at any rate, are.
a source of uneasiness. The Navaho feel
that the cripple is out of harmony with
the universe, and close contact with him
might bring disharmony into one's
own life. And infants who are born
deformed, among these people who have
a great love for children, are sometimes
abandoned to die, or taken to a hospital
and left there.
In Burma Dr. Seagrave found that the
Katchin were ready and even eager for
operation when they sure that this was
desirable. At one time a man offered a
great sword for the incision by way of
persuading the surgeon who was hes-
itating over the advisability of operating
on the abdomen, saying that he would
not hold the surgeon responsible if the
operation failed. The need for surgery,
however, was not usually recognized by
these people until it was too late. For a
year, everyone undergoing appendectomy
died, since the patients came only after
rupture ; yet they did not hesitate to
come, even though they knew that no
one had survived this operation. In
Africa also, Dr. Schweitzer found that
.. 1.,. T, .. o.. o., r1<&gt; fn., nnnr, f o"wrrn, " n, rnr, fhofthe people were ready to accept surgery, even that
involving amputation, and were impressed with
the dramatic cure erected. At one time a man
walked three hundred mile. s to be operated on.
The effects of change, and of regulations in-
tended to bring about change, have sometimes
been unforeseen. Pure water campaigns, direct-
ed at the elimination of enteric disorders, have
actually reduced malaria through removing the
source of the swamp, and have resulted in better
roads, as in a village in Egypt, or a village park,
as in a Macedonian village. A hut tax in Africa,
and the scarcity in timber resulting from indus-
trialization, have brought about overcrowding
and possibly an increase in ill-health. The in-
troduction of medicine has meant a loss of faith
in the known, and when new medicines proved
too expensive, people found themselves without
any medicine at all.
Industrialization and the migration of labour,
as well as the opening of roads and the esta-
blishment of improved transportation, have meant
that local diseases have been spread to areas
where there was no immunity.
Industry, which has been responsible for much
ill-health and disruption, has also been respon-
sible for many health programmes in colonial
areas, since people in ill-health or low health
make wasteful workers. And the economic moti-
vation for the introduction of health measures
has been reported from rural areas also, where
people have been persuaded to control food-
waters which formed breeding places for malarial
mosquitoes, only when they discovered that these
also damaged the crops. 
evil by the introduction of substances under the
skin. The practice of pricking the skin with a
needle is also often present. The Burmese did
not resist injections when these were first intro-
duced, for tattooing was prevalent here, as well
as the practice of introducing charms and medi-
cines under the skin. In Oceanic regions where
tattooing is prevalent, Dr. Lambert found that
people came to him demanding the"needle."
On the other hand, great resistance to inocula-
tion was encountered among tribes in northern
Burma. People deserted their villages in panic
when they heard that he was coming to
inoculate against a raging epidemic of plague.
'Use my sword, doctor'
THERE are certain requisites for the acceptablephysician. Moslem women-except where
change has been carefully induced-will not
allow themselves to be examined by a male phy-
sician. In West Africa, physicians younger than
the husband cannot look at or treat a wife, but
those older can do so without bringing harm.
In many cultures the physician's right to treat
must be validated, perhaps by supernatural
sanction, perhaps by payment. Among the Tiv,
a"physician"could not treat a patient effecti-
vely unless he had paid for the knowledge and
also for the right to give that particular treat-
ment. Often the treatment itself is ineffectiv8.,...,

FROM TILLAGE TO FACTORY
 BY UNEASY-STAGES
C IVILIZATION in the last centuryhas meant increasing indus-
trialization in Europe as well as
in the United States, and in the
countries with which they came in
contact, and which, courted or coerced
into commerce with them, also became
progressively industrialized. In the
West and East the process was, for
long, unplanned. The people in res-
pomible positions had, as a rule, no
view of the total picture, and no sus-
picion of the eventual results and
their ramifications.
Even now, after long experience, and
with all our awareness and intensive
investigation of the concomitants of
industrialization, we are astounded
when we see the far-reaching results
of the introduction of money into a
barter economy, or of a new tool as
simple as the kerosene lamp or a
wooden-wheeled wagon.
Industrialization is with us to stay.
We may decry its effects, as did a
Venezuelan editor recently, appalled
at the hidden poverty of rich, indu-
strialized Caracas. Yet,"The demo-
graphic consequences of industrializ-
ation constitute a powerful propulsive
toward further industrialization... It
is not a reversible process."
Life with father
OTHER countries, still primarilyt t agrarian, are now drawn into the
process of industrialization as a
result of contact with Western civi-
lization. Sometimes, in introducing a
programme of industrialization, or the
building of great public works and
large factories, such countries have
introduced radical change in the
standard of living, drastically curtail-
ing consumers'goods. Usually the
effects have been much more far-
reaching and costly in human welfare
than this statement implies.
The areas of agricultural change
and industrialization overlap in cer-
tain respects. Large plantations,
usually owned and operated by people
of Western origin, use large numbers
of labourers as does industry, and,
seeing the process merely as one of
money-making, often exploit land and
people. In Africa, plantations are
often near the labourers'native vil-
lages, so that there is no accompany-
ing disruption of the family and
village life, as there is in connection
with industry ; but in New Guinea,
where labourers were brought from
great distances, there was such dis-
ruption, as well as demoralization
among the large groups of men living
without women and without families
or villages.
In addition, mechanization itself,
whether in agriculture or in industry,
separates man from the traditional
processes and techniques of his social
unit, from the skills which he learned
as an aspect of his belongingness
with his family, or of identification
with his father and his line of ances-
tors. Finally, even on small farms,
where cash crops have been introduc-
ed, the effects of the new money
economy have often been of the same
kind as with the introduction of
industrial wages.
From pitcher to pump
GOVERNMENTS t. hroughout theworld have done away with the
more obvious ills of industrial
labour. But the implications of indus-
trialization for mental health are not
covered by the new laws. For example,
when it wa. s proposed to a group of
fellahin that a village pump be ins-
talled as a labour saving device for
the women, they said,"You say that
the pump will save our women effort
and time. If that happens, what are
they going to do with themselves all
day long ?" And it is not merely a
question of occupying time. This is
one of the components of womanhood ;
a woman carries water from the
fountain. When Arab pictures are
made for the tourist trade, they often
portray a woman with a water
pitcher.
So also, among the Tiv, as well as
the Burmese, women were identified
with the pounding mortar ; and the
wife, whom the Tiv, Akiga, pictures,
was one who spun and wove for her
husband. What happens to the
woman, and to the man's relation
with her, when she ceases to fulfill her
role, to fit the picture of womanhood
and wifehood ? When work is neither
virtue nor necessity, but merely a way
of life, what happens when"labour"
is. saved ? what happens when indus-
triousness is one of the highest virtues,
as it is with some American Indians ?
Such factors must be taken into
account when and if industrialization
is to be introduced without undue
destruction. For

HUMAN PROBLEMS OF INDUSTRI
(Continued from previous page)
Greece must be industrialized and must change
to a predominantly cash crop economy if it is to be
able to support its growing population, and to raise
its standard of living. This would mean that a
larger market for industrial products should be
found at home. It is suggested that women in the
villages be persuaded to buy factory woven cloth,
and to send their clothes to the laundry and to
support processing industries in general. Yet the
laundering on the slab by the village fountain, or
on the rocks by the stream, is a time of enjoyable
social intercourse ; one of the beloved songs of the
round dance tells of such a laundering group.
Again, visitors bring away a happy picture of
the mother weaving under the grape arbor in the
spring, now and then stirring the cooking pot,
while her children play about. Good mothers
start weaving for their daughters almost from
birth. Factory woven cloth is in use to some
extent, but can all home weaving disappear without
impoverishing the life of the individual and of the
family ? And if it does, can industry provide an
equally meaningful occupation to take up the
released time ?
The FAO report suggests that Greeks be per-
suaded to invest their money in industry, so as to
make industrialization possible ; but this runs
counter to the Greek attitude of trusting only a
sure thing, the known present. One speculates
about the future, not in the future. A Greek tra-
ditionally likes his money in the form of a lump
under the mattress, not as so many figures on a
chart, or a number of shares of stock. And when
people love their life on the land so much that the
greatest gift of gratitude they can send to the UN
is a jar of Peloponnesian earth, the displacement
of the individual or the family from the village to
the industrial centre could bring much distress.
All these difficulties are not insurmountable, but to
effect technological change with the least human
destruction, these problems and others of their
kind must be taken into account.
Money was incidental
WE must distinguish between the presence ofmoney in a community and a money eco-
nomy. For example, Burma traditionally
had essentially a subsistence and barter economy,
although money was in use. Money was not used
to create more money, or to found a fortune, or to
make the individual independent of the family ;
and the earning of money was incidental to living,
it was not an end.
Linton reports trying to buy the entire stock of
pieces of raffia cloth from a trader in a Madagas-
car market town, and of being refused on the
grounds that the trader would be bored through
the rest of the days if he had nothing to sell. In
addition, the buyer, being a poor bargainer, was
actually paying too high a price ; yet bargaining
is often considered the spice of social intercourse,
and this too may have caused the trader to refuse
to give up a day's bargaining for the sake of extra
profit. This is not what the Western world means
by a money economy.
Technological change in agriculture, as well as
in industrialization, has introduced a money eco-
nomy in many regions. For example, the Navaho,
who were established by the United States Govern-
ment on farms in an unusually fertile strip,
learned to neglect their farms so as to work for
cash wages. Mothers left their children untended,
gave up time-consuming preparation of their tra-
ditional foods for makeshift, processed store foods.
The health of the Navaho children, it was found,
had been maintained at a higher level under the
conditions of a subsistence economy.
In Africa, the introduction of a money economy
has usually meant atomization of the individuals
within the family, complete destruction of the
structuring of family relationships, and of the
social and economic system of the group.
The money economy has meant secession and
revolt, the undermining of parental authority
and the authority of tradition, and thus has
resulted in the rise of the"younger generation"as
a class apart. Marriage is often no longer a con-
tract between two families but, particularly in the
cities, one between a man and a woman. The tra-
ditional lab ala, the brideprice, which cemented two
families in interdependence and maintained
strongly structured continuities within the family,
is now frequently handed by the boy to the girl.
He convenientiy disappeared
WHERE a traveller always knew he could findready hospitality, he now often has to pay
for food and shelter, even to his relatives ;
or he may find that his friend, seeing a traveller
arriving, has conveniently disappeared, to spare
himself the expense of entertaining with bought
food, or food he could sell for cash. In China also,
industrialization has meant that"family relations
are more and more disregarded in property
ownership."
Where money economy has not been accepted or
understood by people living in the midst of this
industrial society, there is frequently a tendency
toward exploitation.
New tools are being introduced, whether in agri-
culture or industry, to save labour or to increase
production, or to improve a product, but the
change they effect often involves much more than
this. Where technology is simple, the tool is an
extension of the body ; the shuttle elongates and
refines the finger, the mallet is a harder and more
powerful fist. The tool follows the rhythm of the
body ; it enhances and intensifies ; but it does not
replace and does not introduce anything basically
different. But the machine is not body-patterned.
It has its own existence, its own rhythm, to which
man must submit.
The woman at her handloom controls the ten-
sion of the weft by the feeling in her muscles and
the rhythm of her body motion ; in the factory she
watches the loom, and acts at externally stated
intervals, as the operations of the machine dictate
them. When she worked at home, she followed
her own rhythm, and ended an operation when
she felt-by the resistence against the pounding
mallet or the feel between her fingers-that the
process was complete. In the factory she is asked
to adjust her rhythm to that of the rhythm pres-
cribed by the factory ; to do things according to
externally set time limits.
The changes of processes and tools involved in
industrialization have often brought a shattering
break between the living and the all-important,
sustaining dead members of the family unit."To
the Chinese the introduction of power machinery
meant (that)... he had to throw over not only
habits of work but a whole ideology ; for, dissatis-
faction'with the ways of his fathers in one parti-
cular meant doubt of the father's way of life in
all its aspects. If the old loom must be discarded,
then a hundred other things must be discarded
with it for there are somehow no adequate substi-
tutes."
The suggested technological changes are some-
times uneconomical, as the labour they save is
cheaper than the purchase and upkeep of the new
tool. Sometimes they are resisted precisely be-
cause they do save labour, threatening to deprive
workers of their maintenance. A Puerto Rican
company which delayed importation and use of
mechanical and chemical means of lowering pro-
duction costs is much admired by the workers,
partly because it does not displace them, partly on
the ground that"the cane needs the human touch
to grow well,"and because of a feeling that herbi-
cide is evil.
Sometimes machines are introduced without
plan and fail because no provision is made for
upkeep or replacement of parts, as when outboard
motors were introduced in Brazil without parts for
repair, and without, or with exorbitantly expen-
sive, oil for fuelling. Agricultural machinery is
demonstrated to farmers far too poor to afford
its purchase and upkeep and with farms too small
for its effective use, when what they need is an
improved hoe or plough. In sections of Africa, the
sewing machine and manufactured cloth have been
introduced without the use of the needle. Afri-
cans buy clothing made on sewing machines by
Indians, but they have no way of mending it, or
having it mended, since machine mending has not
been introduced.
The introduction of a new tool which is comple-
tely accepted may have unimagined results. In
certain sections of Uganda, the introduction of
lamps meant an added fire hazard to thatched
roofs and provided, in turn, fireproof roofing :
kerosene tins, which, flattened, took the place of
the thatching materials which were rapidly de-
creasing because of the increasing use of land for
cash crops. This affected the health picture, since
the old roofing had harboured rats which were a
plague hazard. However, the next step in effi-
ciency has resulted in the sale of kerosene in the
bulk, and people now carry it home in coca cola
or beer bottles ; the new roofing material has disap-
peared, and the administration of Uganda now has
to experiment with suitable roofing materials.
Distaste for wage earning
OBSTACLES to the establishment of an industry
are often encountered, arising from the values
of the culture involved. The Masai, for
example, will not work for wages, since tending
cattle is the only valued occupation, and cattle
themselves, the highest good. In many parts of
Africa the relationship of obedience to someone
without traditional authority is lacking. The Zulus,
considering themselves a dominant warrior race,
think it degrading to accept the discipline of indus-
trial labour ; they are ready, however, to accept
domestic service, since this falls within a differently
structured relationship. The Tiv say that only boys
who are asocial and who-do not fit into the group
are ready to live away from home earning wages :
that is, boys who are essentially maladjusted. On
the other hand, when the railroad went through
Tiv country, groups of people from the district
concerned worked happily for wages, and revealed
qualities much liked by their employers.
The assumption that all peoples have an incen-
tive to improve the standard of living, and there-
fore of taking on employment, is not justified.
Puerto Rican workers expressed a desire to earn
enough money to pay the first installment on the
installation of electric light or the purchase of a

ALIZATION
radio ; yet this desire often does not counterbalance
the distaste for working for wages, so that pay-
ments may not be completed, or an individual may
leave his employment when he has some money
accumulated.
In the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan when peasant pro-
prietors found their incomes increased to unaccus-
tomed amounts, they did not know what to do with
the surplus, and spent it hiring others to do their
work. Their incomes had been increased through
external aid, not through internal motivation such
as desire for new goods and services. Or, the in-
centive may be present, but not as an incentive to
improve subsistence. For example, in China, one
large employer of a highly skilled class of labour,
not long ago, was moved by the obvious physical
inefficiency of many of his employees and the large
incidence of sickness among them to raise wages
of his own accord. The only result, as he was able
to disern not long afterwards, was that each of
these men was now supporting an even larger
number of relatives than a person in his position
was expected to look after.
In Puerto Rico, where the pattern of supporting
a large number of dependent relatives is pre-
sent along with changing values making for
individualism, men prefer to emigrate alone to the
United States for wage work, so that, if they are
single, they can save or spend their money as they
please with no relatives to claim a share, and if
they are married, they can send money home to
their wives knowing that it will be used for the
immediate family, since women living without men
are not supposed to support dependents.
In Annam it is difficult to get the original inha-
bitants to work in the mines, as they fear to disturb
the fountain spirits ; and their fears are supported
by the high mortality in the mining occupation.
In many parts of the world we find that one
works as necessity calls ; this may be the need for
the day's food, or for preparation for a ceremonial,
or it may be the need of the land or the growing
plant which must be attended to on that particular
day. But the machine has no such insistent need ;
so if the worker has enough food or money for his
needs, he does not see why he has to go to his job.
In fact, if he also has a garden, or if the fish are
running in the stream, he has a valid reason for
not going. This is part of a general attitude which
we find also in connection with school attendance.
And it is an aspect of the different conception of
time as a process rather than as programmatic.
People may operate in terms of mechanical
"time-saving"tools-automobiles, radios, tele-
graph-but this does not mean that they accept
and upkeep of the new tool. Sometimes they are resisted
or to buy it and with farms too small for its effective use.
spinning and weaving. What happens to the woman and
Nas the accepted picture of womanhood and wifehood ?
the need for speed which these implements repre-
sent ; they may only be modern conveniences to
these people. The exact minute may be unim-
portant, and the time'''saved''using such devices
may nevertheless be spent in inactivity ; people
"stand or sit doing very little for hours at a time."
Industrialization, in the interest of good results
and human welfare, must take account of such
basic patterns, either working within them, or else
educating people in an understanding of the
Western framework of industrial work.
Cultural attitudes often determine the compo-
sition and quality of the personnel in an industrial
establishment. Where familial values are of para-
mount importance, as in Greece, China, and Japan,
a man has to give jobs to relatives, choosing them
neither according to ability nor according to merit.
And even when the employees are not all relatives,
the structure of the organization may follow the
iines of the kinship unit. In China, for example,
there was reluctance to fire a delinquent em-
ployee ; as one punished one's own son for wrong-
doing, but did not expel him from the family, there
was an additional preference for punishment, and
for such reasons businesses in China and Japan
were found to lose money. In Japan, when a
business was losing money and there was not
enough work for all the employees, the employer
did not therefore dismiss them ; he was responsible
for them.
In Burma, the attitude against the accumulation
of capital, the tendency to spend much money for
religious purposes, the tenet that a Buddhist can-
not make a valid will, all militate against the
creation of capital needed for industrial enterprise
of any major scope. However, small mills and
small plants in rural areas have been increasing
and fit into the Burmese pattern. Under British
administration, machinery for agriculture was
regarded with suspicion as another device to raise
taxable capacity, but agricultural shows, where
they were exhibited, were attended, since they fit
into the pattern of"convivial celebration, with a
few side shows such as exhibitions of fertilizers
and insect pests, matters to which the government
attaches superstitious importance."
Time on their hands
THE wast-e in human welfare which came intobeing as a by-product of industrialization has
caused much concern among governments, so-
cial scientists, and foundations. There appears to be
general agreement that decentralization of indus-
try, bringing work to the village or to its vicinity,
within the framework of known associations and
associational ties, will make. for less disruption
and, at the same time, will bring the increase in
income needed for raising the standard of living.
Village industries can provide the funds for
raising the standard of living, and can fill the
gap created when handicrafts give way to manu-
factured goods. They can also, in part, be the
answer to the mechanization of agriculture which
often releases time for which there is no provision.
As it is, in many villages in India, China, and the
Philippines, the farmers are actually partly unem-'
ployed. In the Chinese villages it is estimated
that the farmers and farm labourers are unem-
ployed for periods of six to eight months a year.
The introduction of village industries is not,
however, without difficulties. In India it is found
that the villagers often do not want to be orga-
nized into new cooperative units, or any created
units.
Havoc in family life
- w N China, in 1935, village industry in the districtof Kiangying was working havoc in family life.
Before it was introduced, the women had spent
much of their time helping the men in the fields
and had raised silkworms ; they had done their
spinning and weaving only during their free time.
When home knitting with a hand machine was
introduced, women knitted late into the night by
kerosene lamps, and, since they had to spend so
much of their time caring for old people and young
children, they had no time even to eat their meals
with the family, but ate at their work. In times
of crop failure, when the home industry was the
only means of subsistence, the loom had to be busy
all the time if there was only one loom in the
house. This meant that members of the family
had to work at it in shifts twenty-four hours a day.
This was an economic solution, but one that failed
on the social level.
'There have been difficulties and destruction ;
but through a study of the local situation,
through an understanding of and respect for
the existing framework, such difficulties are being
solved. China's cooperatives have become increas-
ingly successful in their social effects. The re-
cently formulated programme proposes to carry
over into industrialization the traditional coopera-
tive relationships of guild and family ; it aims at
industrializing the already present village units.
In India, careful teaching by people who have
an understanding of the need for a long period of
instruction, achieved the introduction of the idea
of village industry. In one village, even the latrine
was incorporated into the home industry scheme,
so that many homes now have two latrines, one
in use while the contents of the other are being
composted for sale as fertilizer. In Mexico and
Ecuador, some home industries have fitted into
existing, valued, and enjoyed patterns, with happy
results.

'WE SHALL KEEP OUR WOODEN PLOUGHS ;
THEY ARE MUCH KINDER TO THE EARTH' EY AR
TECHNOLOGICAL c h a n g e inagriculture is directed at the
resources available for cul-
tivation, at methods of production,
and at the organization of pro-
duction. These three factors are
interrelated, and whether we deal
with water control, the improvement
of land or seed or livestock, basic to
ail is the work of man, his division
ci labour, his groupings, his tra-
ditional procedures, his relationship
to the land. His survival and often
also the reason why he wants to
survive, depend on these. He will
be the instrument of change ; and
all change, even in techniques and
tools used, will affect his way of life
and his relations with others.
The immediate need for agri-
cultural changes arises from the
great increase in population in
recent years. Certam general
changes with specific suggestions for
particular regions are proposed.
These include soil conservation, in-
cluding reforestation and contour
ploughing ; livestock improvement ;
seed improvement ; pest control ;
land improvement ; introduction of
casn crops ; mechanization.
Non-human as these categories
appear to be, they actually concern
the life of people at every turn. For
example, prevention of overgrazing
and of the burning of brush mean
that shepherds, abandoning the
ways of their fathers, have to take
on a strange occupation out of
necessity, not from choice. Water
control may mean that the course
of rivers must be changed, as it does
in Greece, perhaps moving people
away from the land of their fathers.
Pest control and seed improvement
involve persuading people that these
measures are necessary for a better
crop. Indians in Mexico, who see
agricultural mishaps as acts of God,
often see no reason why they should
not sell their good seed, since it
brings more money, and plant their
poorer seed.
To introduce change effectively, it
is necessary to know existing con-
ditions. Where it--involves im-
plementation by people, it must first
be accepted. Otherwise the new
proposals, however simple, will be
. defeated. When pest control is im-
perative, people will nevertheless
release the rats from their traps.
Where immunization of cattle is
necessary, farmers will hide their
cattle. And where land reform is
introduced without accompanying
measures for a reformed credit
system, the land will again be
concentrated in the hands of a few
within a few years.
Seeing is believing
AND since change is proposed inthe interests of human welfare,
it is important to see to it that
it is introduced constructively or, at
any rate, with a minimum of dis-
ruption and destruction of esta-
blished interrelationship and values.
Basic attitudes, concepts, and values
must, therefore, be considered.
Agricultural activity is often con-
ceived of as an interrelationship
with the cherishing earth. In India
the Baiga refused to use an iron
plough since this would repay with
harshness the generosity of the land,
tearing her breasts and breaking her
belly ; they found the wooden hoe
more gentle. We find the Hopi
who do not think of themselves as
wresting a living from the arid land,
but rather conceive of their re-
lationship as one of aid to the land
which wants to grow the valued corn
for the Hopi, but cannot do so
without their help.
In many parts of the world we
find cultures adhering to the belief
that man has no causal effect upon
his own future or the future of the
land ; God, not man, can improve
man's lot It is difficult to persuade
such people to use fertilizers, or to
save the best seed for planting, since
man is responsible only for the
performance, and the divine for the
success, of the act.
In many groups we find the atti-
tude of doing with what is there,
rather than changing it, of coping
rather than fixing. Such people see
no reason why"anything should be
done about it."When traditional
methods produce some crops, main-
tain a measure of health, keep some
of the soil from running off, or when
a cow has some vigour, it is better to
cope with these shortcomings, des-
pite their inadequacies or incon-
veniences, than to effect a disturbing
change ; in fact, it is possible that
adjustment is such an automatic
reaction that the inadequacy is not
even noticed. It is difficult to
persuade people with this attitude
that reforestation is necessary until
it is too late to do anything about
it ; they adjust to a poor yield, or
to the diminished vigour or milk
supply of their cow until the
situation may develop beyond the
help of man.
. All of these attitudes are, of
course, related to the positive value
which the traditional way of life
holds for many of the people. Where
this is paramount, change is either
re. sisted or, if accepted, it is kept
along the fringes. Most of the
farmers of the world are not
motivated by abstract ends or
speculative results. Statistics that
show what will happen if vetch is
planted or fertilizer applied are
meaningless to them. For them,
"seeing is believing."
The distru. st of new and untried
ways is an obverse of the faith in
the known, that which with all its
ups and downs has supported the
society since time immemorial.
Unfortunately, it is also rooted in
the mistakes made by the agents of
change who sometimes managed to
persuade the peasants to use new
ways which proved disastrous
because of local conditions. In
Burma, deep ploughing introduced
by European agricultural experts
broke up the hard pan that held
the water in the rice fields. In
Turkey, experts trained abroad
persuaded some of the younger
peasants to remove the stones from
their tilled land ; when the grain
sprouted, the fields of the old men
had a better crop, since, in that dry
climate, the stones served the
function of preserving moisture.
Mistakes of this sort are acceptable
to people who are willing to take
the risk of trying the new ; but they
shake the faith of those who believe
in tried and proven procedure alone.
Programmes for improvement are
sometimes rendered ineffective
because of failure to take account
of what the people specifically value.
Values may range in intensity from
strong preferences to highly emo-
tionally charged attitudes of a
religious significance.
We have, for example, the religious
status of the cow in India and
Africa. Here we have to find a way
of helping without taking away from
the people their faith and the
meaning of life. If the sacred cows
are allowed to eat the crops un-
molested while the people are on
the brink of starvation, the agri-
cultural expert can give aid in
making the land more productive
and introduce crops which cows do
not like to eat, as was done recently
in Mahwa of the United Provinces.
Poverty amid plenty
AMONG those who are pastoral/-\ nomads, there are conditions
described as extreme poverty
in the midst of plenty, since money
is nonexistent for food and clothing,
and cattle will not be killed or sold.
Among such people the application
of veterinary science has resulted
merely in overstocking. Such people
name themselves after their cattle,
compose songs for them, spend their
leisure contemplating them, form
personal attachments to them. To
introduce an economic conception of
the cattle to these people, if this
were possible at all, would be to
destroy valuflnd security. In many
primitive societies the large amount
of time and human energy spent in
ritual, magic, and other religious
practices seems to be wasted in the
eyes of the agricultural expert. But
to the native, they give him faith
in his work, saving him from the
anxieties which so often attend the
work of the cultivator. It is against
this background that proposed
measures should be viewed.
The introduction of mechanized
tools is confronted by an obstacle in
the small size of many holdings.
Even so apparently small a change
as that from a wooden to an iron
plough may have widespread reper-
cussions as in the case of villages
of the United Provinces of India.
Here it threaten established
human relationships. A man
inherits a relationship to a carpenter
family whose task it is to make and
repair the ploughs. This family is
always invited to the farmer's feasts,
and the women are given saris. The
relationship, the"pay,"and the
gifts continue whether ploughs are
made or not.
Perhaps the farmer can be taught
to repair his own plough, but it
would mean personal reorientation
as well as a change in the valued
relationship structure. Again,
because of the extremely short
ploughing season, it is necessary that
there be no delays ; an iron plough
with brittle shears needs frequent
repairs and replacements by experts
who can be reached only after
covering a distance over bad roads.
But the carpenter is in the field
with the farmer, ready to repair the
wooden plough.
Then too, an iron plough would
require heavier draft animals which
in turn would need more fodder
than is now available. The wooden
plough is light and can be carried
easily from strip to strip, and a
farmer has probably five widely
scattered strips to plough. In order to
introduce a heavy plough at all it
is necessary to persuade the villagers
to consolidate their holdings. The
government has decreed that when
seventy-five per cent of the villagers
demand consolidation, the rest will
have to accede. Until a few months
ago, only one village had demanded
consolidation of holdings, and even
then when the farmers realized that
this meant each would have to give
up strips treasured because of loca-
tion or ancestral association, the
project fell through.
In some areas it is uneconomical to
introduce mechanization because
human labour is cheaper, and re-
mains cheaper because the people
themselves place a low valuation
upon it : In Indone, sia, the workers
fatalistically accept the fact that the
rate of pay for buffalo labour is
twice that of human labour.
In general, mechanization can
have an overwhelming effect on
human welfare by rupturing the
nourishing continuity of man with
the land, with his own body rhythms,
and with his traditional past. In
cultures such as those of the Middle
East and Greece and of Latin Amer-
ica, where desires and aspirations
have limits, mechanization will
probably mean, not that man will
cultivate more land, but that he will
work less, and at a less satisfying
occupation at that.
Where work, particularly tradi-
tional work, is life, this may be a
serious matter. It has been found
that mechanization, such as the use
of tractors designed for soggy
riceland and the self-propelled
threshers in Southeast Asia, has
meant the shifting of tenant labour
to hired labour and has led to the
dislocation of the tenant group,
often separating the members from
the burial place of their fathers,
from land which they had previ-
ously owned and with which they
and their families had been
continuous.
o ONE M
THE low level of nutrition in most areasf the world is one of the main
concerns of our time. Sheer hunger is
prevalent, and there is the hidden hunger of
pecpte who) ive on inadequate food. We
do not know whether the food supply of the
world was ever adequate everywhere. Cer-
tainly with the increase in population which
accompanied contact with Western civilization
itself, with industrialization and its by-
products, the supply has become inadequate,
for increase of crops has not kept up with
the population growth.
Again, the increase and concentration of
population has sometimes destroyed the very
sources of the food. Overpopulation has
meant overcultivation, and the poverty of the
soil has been reflected not only in diminished
returns but also in crops deficient in essential
minerals. It has meant soil erosion and the
carrying away of the top soil as silt.
Not all difficulties in the realm of nutrition
are due to contact with Western civilization,
however. In the Middle East and the Far
East, for example, nutrition is affected by the
lack of methods for preservation. Lack of
adequate transportation has also meant poor
nutrition. Egyptian fellahin need citrus pro-
ducts, but cannot get them even though they

'S FOOD IS ANOTHER MAN'S POISON'
grow not far away. In China, a surplus of
food in one area cannot alleviate famine in
another, since the food cannot be brought to
the hungry population.
Poor nutrition cannot, then, be attacked by
the dietitian atone. Agricultural specialists
in Greece are working for nutrition when they
institute reforestation. And in many areas,
public health workers, becoming aware of the
pressing need for better nutrition, find them-
selves in the field of agriculture, advocating
better seed and more efficient methods of
preservation.
It is not enough, however, to increase the
available food supply. What has been supplied
must be considered food, and acceptable food,
by the people. In Africa, the British Govern-
ment supplied veterinary service to cattle-
raising tribes, but this did not increase their
food supply at all, and actually contributed to
soil erosion and depletion. These people love
their cattle and kill them only on ceremonial
occasions ; since the ceremonial occasions did
not increase in number, the saving of cattle
through veterinary aid merely resulted in too
many cattle on the land.
To introduce adequate nutrition, it is impor-
tant to bring about changes that are in
keeping with the established food habits of
the people, and are acceptable within the
framework of their value system.
It is undignified
to eat an orange
FOR example, in the United States in theSouth mothers cook food the way each
child likes it, compensating for the
poorness and monotony of the ingredients ; and
any change in the preparation of food would
introduce change in personal relationships. In
some societies, the breast or other food is
offered to the child after punishment ; if we
persuade these people to offer the breast only
at scheduled feedings, or teach them that it
is harmful to eat between meals, we have made
ourselves responsible for finding some way in
which the mother can show reassurance and
acceptance to the punished child.
In some societies, where meals end with a
sweet dessert, mothers withhold dessert as a
way of punishing the child ; this results in a
devaluation of that part of the meal which
contains essential elements necessary for nutri-
tional balance, and the child has to be urged
to eat them because"they are good for him".
Yet mothers depend on this form of punishment,
and will resist attempts to change this stress
on the dessert.
Again, where milk and pulped food are
associated with infancy, men will resist the
drinking of milk, or eating of pulped foods
in special diets which call for them. Where
home and food are strongly identified, chil-
dren reject the school meal, and men the
meal art the plant ; and business concerns in
such countries often give their employees a
longer lunch hour, or arrange the work day
in such a way that men can eat their meals
at home.
A study made by the Committee on Food
Habits of the National Research Council in
the United States during the last war has
made workers aware of the importance of the
"rote which learning plays in the maintenance
of a viable dietary pattern. We now ask, not
how we change a people's bad habits into
good habits, but what are their habits, how
are they learned, by what mechanisms are the
self-preservative choices of some foods and
rejections of others, perpetuated".
There are specific preferences and objec-
tions which affect nutrition and health as well
as the introduction of any new food or way of
preparation. West Africans, for example, have
an aversion to food in its raw state, as fit only
for cattle. The older people think it undig-
nified to eat oranges and discourage children
from eating them as oranges will make them
"soft". Greeks like raw vegetables and fruits,
but not all vegetables are considered edible
when raw. Cucumbers can be eaten only raw,
but zucchini squash must be cooked ; green
beans and peas can never be eaten raw ;
cabbage is good when raw, but cauliflower is
inedible. The fact that many leafy vegetables
go into the salad does not mean that any
such vegetable belongs there.
In sections of Africa, meat is eaten raw,
and food is seasoned with mineral salts ; and
both these practices lead to the spread of
intestinal diseases. Puerto Ricans, living pre-
cariously on too little food, often will not eat
even fruit which grows wild, as they consider
fruit to be poisonous, or dangerous, or a cause
of indigestion. Among many, there is the
feeling that fruit is"cold", a term used for
something objectionable.
Mistakes have been made in the past,
before we knew the importance of food habits
and the cultural and social context of the
food. We tried to introduce supplementary
nutrients through the medium of cream soups
to people who, though they liked soups, would
eat nothing bland and nothing creamy unless
it also contained pieces offering resistance in
chewing.
The right to a diet
of fried chicken
WE upset dietary balance by persuadingSpanish Ame ican schoolchildren in
New Mexico to eat white bread
instead of cold corn tortillas, when their main
source of calcium came from the lime water
in which the corn of the tartillas had been
soaked. We persuaded their mothers to
substitute canned spinach for wild greens, and
when there was no money to buy spinach, the
children went without greens. Hopi mothers
were forced to wean their children if these had
to be hospitalized after they were a year old ;
and when the children came back, the expense
of giving them canned milk out of individual
small cans-since no refrigeration was avail-
able-was sometimes too great for the family
to maintain.
Agricultural experts warn of possible dis-
ruption of dietary balance with the increase of
commercialization. For example, in many parts
of rural India where large amounts of ghee
butter are consumed, the farmer's family
depends heavily on the accompanying butter-
milk ; if butter-making is to become industria-
lized, nutritional planning should take into
account the gap this will leave in the family
diet.
Child care services have often urged new
foods for children, which have perhaps been
good for nutritional adequacy but have made
for strain in family relations. In Greece, where
one nutritionist persuaded mothers to intro-
duce raisin bread and other unacceptable
items into the family meal, this often created
a split between the father's and the children's
food, or brought derision from the father, or
otherwise produced discontinuity in an occa-
sion which is essentially a family communion.
It would probably be equally effective, and
less destructive, to introduce change through
less emotionally important eating situations.
For example, if a Greek child must eat raisins,
these can be introduced into the frequent
snacks,"the passing of the time"in which all
Greeks indulge, as dry chewy raisins, fitting
into an already present food pattern. Cer-
tainly very valuable nutrients can be added
by persuading Greeks to eat more of the
roasted chickpeas they like so well, and which
are so easily and cheaply available. In Puerto
Rico, fruit, if eaten at all, is eaten between
meals, and there would be less resistance if
consumption of more fruit was introduced at
such times.
One commonly practised method of im-
proving nutrition is through supplementary
feeding of children and of expectant and
lactating mothers. This does not attempt to
change or stop existing practices. Such
attempts have met with resistance in the
past, as in an instance when a public health
nurse in a Chinese district was rejected
because she tried to persuade parturient
mothers to eat vegetables instead of a diet
of fried chicken ; these women had been eating
mainly vegetables all their lives, and had
looked to this period when their special status
would be acknowledged by this special diet.
However, in giving supplementary feedings
it is well to remember, in addition, that food
is sometimes the coin of society, of social
ritual, and that much of its emotional suste-
nance is lost when it is not part of the family
meal. During the last war, the Greeks in
Athens voiced a preference for eating cold
food in their unheated houses, rather than hot
food in warm soup-kitchens. UNRRA workers
found 0 similar preference in Germany, also.
Food preferences and aversions have success-
fully been taken into consideration in intro-
ducing change. In nSiam, where there is an
aversion to cow's milk, canned milk did not
evoke the image of the cow, and was intro-
duced acceptably. Wheat products are
increasingly being introduced in the Far East,
either in terms of existing foods such as
noodles and chapattis, or as rolls for snacks,
or bread for an accompaniment to the rice.

GREAT PAINTINGS FOR EVERYONE
FOR those many persons who onlyoccasionally have the chance to
see the originals of great paint-
ings and, even more, for the vast
majority of people all over the world
who can never hope to see the mas-
terpieces in countless galleries and
private collection, the colour repro-
duction is the best substitute. But
many of the existing colour repro-
ductions are of poor quality, and
many paintings of little value are
reproduced.
With the aim of making the best
colour reproductions more easily
available to teachers, students and
the general art-interested public
throughout the world, Unesco has
produced, with the aid of interna-
tional art authorities, two catalogue-
lisping more than 1.000 paintings of
which high-quality reproductions
exist and can be obtained. These
volumes are intended not only to
bring art into homes and schools and
to foster the understanding and en-
joyment of it ; but al so to encourage
the increased production of colour-
prints and the improvement of
standards and methods.
Unesco has just published a new
and revised edition of the Catalogue
of colour reproductions of paintings
prior to 1860 (1), which replaces a
similar volume issued in 1950 and is
the companion to another Unesco
catalogue devoted to paintings exe-
cuted after 1860. In the case of each
work listed, there is an identification
photograph of the original painting
and a biographical sketch of the
artist. The price, size and other
facts about each reproduction, as
well as the name and address of the
publisher from whom it can be
obtained, are also given.
The main critpria bv which the
prints have been chosen are the
fidelily of the reproduction, the
significance of the artist, and the
importance of the original painting.
Since the first edition of the cata-
logue of paint in prior to 1860 was
issued, publishers throughout the
world, with whom Unesco maintain-
ed contact, submitted new colour
prints. Of these 130 were chosen
for inclusion in the new edition.
Moreover, a careful review of the
first edition led to the elimination
of 43 reproductions found to be
below the standard it was possible
to adopt for the new edition.
At Unesco House in Paris and at
the Arts Council of Great Britain in
London, complete sets of guide-
prints are kept so that visitors may
see the reproductions themselves.
It is hoped that other countries will
provide similar facilities, so that the
collection of good reproductions
made by Unesco in the catalogues
may lead to bringing into hundreds
of homes, class rooms and libraries
throughout the world great pictures
from other countries which other-
wise would remain unknown.
On pages 12 and 13 we puhlish a
few of the reproductions which have
been added to the new edition of the
Unesco Catalogue.

GERMANY : LARGEST AND
MOST VARIED PRODUCER
OF BOOK TRANSLATIONS
by Georges FRADIER
THE translation of book titles intoa foreign language often seems to
obey certain mysterious laws of
fantasy. From a sales point of view
the title of a book is, of course, an all-
important affair and a lot of hard
thought goes into the choice of any
title.
But when a book is translated into
another language the original title,
even if it lends itself easily to trans-
lation into a fresh idiom, may not
necessarily have sufficient sales appeal.
Foreign publishers, therefore, often feel
themselves obliged to seek out a differ-
ent and more striking one. The result,
however, is sometimes quite startling.
One of Emmanuel Mounier's books,
for example, which was originally
entitled"La Petite Peur du XX'Siecle"
(Minor Fears of the 20th Century) has
now the English title"Be Not Afraid".
Louis Bromfield's"Wild is the River"
has become in German,"Traum in
Louisiana" (Louisiana Dream). In the
same country, a book whose original
cover page asked"After Hitler, Stalin ?",
now bears the title"Von Talleyrand bis
Molotov" (From Talleyrand to Molotov).
In Finland,"La Reine Margot" (Queen
Margot) by Alexandre Dumas became
"Herttuattaren Rakkaus" (The Love
Affairs of the Duchess). And then we
have the remarkable example of a
scientific work"Beyond the Atom"
which in the Netherlands gained a title
pregnant with promise :"Het Lied van
Gods Schepping" (The Song of Divine
Creation).
These are some of the intriguing facts
that can be gleaned from the latest
volume of"Index Translationum",
an International Bibliography of
Translations, which has just been
issued by Unesco (1). This publication
which has now become something of a
"bible"for library workers, publishers
and translators, was first brought out
as a quarterly bulletin by the Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation from 1932
to 1940, and after an interruption of
ten years was revived by Unesco.
- 17, 000 translations
SINCE the new series began in 1950,
Index Translaticnum has from
year to year tried to present as
complete a listing as possible of all
translations published. The latest vo-
lume, the fourth, lists more than 17, 000
works translated in 44 countries during
1951.
The Unesco volume shows that the
, Germans are the world's most prolific
translators, producing more than 1, 300
works each year. France, Italy, Japan
and the Scandinavian countries follow
with about 1, 000 foreign books trans-
lated. In 1951, Britain translated some
500 books and the United States 450.
Germany, the Unesco volume further
reveals, publishes translations of works
in practically all major languages.
Most other countries draw their
material from very few foreign-lan-
guages, usually no more than two or
three. Germany, too, seems to be the
only country which regularly translates
the Scandinavian output of novels,
plays and poetry.
A study of the Index Translationum
also shows the great differences that
exist in translation exchanges between
different countries. In 1951, the
Germans translated hundreds of British
books, yet in Great Britain only 12
German books were published. In
France translations were made of 134
American and 27 Italian books. Italy,
however, chose 128 French books for
translation but only 54 from America.
In most countries, as a general rule,
the best known or most widely trans-
lated works of literature are those of
Great Britain, the United States and
France. But a good third of the British
and American books that are translated
into all languages are detective stories,
crime novels or similar works.
The Unesco volume also seems to
point to the effect that political
differences are having on translations.
In 1951, only a few scientific works and
some half-a-dozen novels from the
United States were published in Russia.
(1, 1 J'l'ir' (' : $10 ; ; ; : ;/- : , nnn FI'l'l/f'iI F"lIIIC.'.
Conversely, only two Soviet works seem
to have been published in the United
States during that year, with the
notable exception of the Russian
classics and certain books written by
Russian emigrants.
A much greater gap still exists,
however, between the occidental
countries and those of the Orient,
between the West and the civilizations
of Islam, India, China and Japan. The
Index Translationum shows that Eu-
ropean language versions are rare
indeed of Asian literary works. Trans-
lations of Western books in the Oriental
countries are equally rare, with the
exception of Japan.
Madame Bovary in Tamil
THE Unesco bibliography shows, forexample, that the most recent
Indian translations of French
novels are"The Count of Monte Cristo",
in Telugu, and"Madame Bovary"in
Tamil. In Burma several European
scientific works were published, but only
one work of fiction-George Orwell's
"Animal Farm".
In Iraq, translations have now ap-
peared of"Robinson Crusoe"and of
Turgeniev's stories. In the Lebanon
only two contemporary novels from the
pens of Pearl Buck and Jean Paul
Sartre were published in 1951, although
several historical works were translated,
most of them relating to the Second
World War. In Egypt, translations
were made of works by Shakespeare,
Racine, Moliere, Oscar Wilde and Pierre
Loti.
Year in and year out there seems to
be little change in the names of the
writers who are most translated. At
the head of this list are the Great
Books, new translations of which are
constantly being published. The 1951
favourites were Aristotle and Plato,
Homer and Euripides ; Shakespeare,
Moliere, Dante and Cervantes ; Goethe,
Rousseau and Voìtaire ; Dickens, Balzac,
Maupassant, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Hugo
and Zola. And, as always, the world's
"best seller", The Bible. A century
from today, this list will probably still
hold good.
It will of course require expanding
with the names of authors of new
classics-our contemporary writers,
though perhaps not all those whose
works are most widely translated today
would lay claim to immortality.
Ever popular Pinocchio
ON this score, the Index provides
some interesting facts. In 1951 the
number of translations of works
by eight famous authors were as fol-
lows : Gide (5) ; Pearl Buck (4) ; Tho-
mas Mann (13) ; Steinbeck and Gorki
(8) ; Bertrand Ru. ssell (16) ; Stalin
(30) ; Winston Churchill (3),. During
the same period dozens of translations
were made of books by Agatha Christie,
Peter Cheyney and Leslie Charteris.
Preferences of a national or cultural
character seem unchanging. Apart
from works of literature, history and
geography books are generally the
most widely translated. The Germanic,
Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon coun-
tries, as well as Italy, however, show a
marked taste for philosophical and
religious works. Scientific books are
most popular in Spain and in the
republics of Eastern Europe.
Fewer works of poetry, as might be
expected, are listed in the Index Trans-
lationum for 1951. Lsrael, Denmark
and Japan translated the largest
number of poets during this period.
Rilke, however, was extremely popular
and his works were published in many
countries and to a lesser degree those
of Lermontov, Heine, Maiakovski and
Baudelaire whose poems are now
available in Japanese and Hebrew.
Among children's books, which get a
fair showing, Pinocchio always takes
first place, followed each year in about
a dozen languages, by the Tales of
Perrault, of Grimm and of Andersen,
by the stories of Jules Verne, and by
"Alice in Wonderland"and"Treasure
Island".
UNESCO
During a three-day workshop course recently, Oju sCience ana i
vocational teachers of the City of Manila high schools learned
how to produce self-made science demonstration apparatus
under the guidance of a Unesco expert in science education.
Converting a light bulb into a laboratory flask is demonstrated
to Manila students by Viktor Holbro, Swiss teacher who has
just completed a Unesco technical assistance mission to
the Philippines to help educators modernize science classes.
An old paste pot or an ink bottle can double as a laboratory
burner with the help of shreds of cotton, a metal tube and some
ingenuity. This Philippine teacher was one of the students
who attended a training course conducted by Mr. Holbro.
Philippine school boys cut up old tin cans which will serve
as part of their home-made laboratory equipment for conducting
science experiments. Blueprints for making all types of labor-
atory equipment are sent to schools throughout the country.

Why does an airplane fly ? With two ping-pong balls and a knitting needle, a Philippine teacher demonstrates Bernoulli's principle. The pressure at the side of
a stream of air is inwards toward the centre of the stream. Pupils can prove this to their own satisfaction ; when they blow on the balls, these come together.
THE ADVENTURES OF A BURNED-OUT BULB
THIS is the story of how a youngSwiss teacher travelled half-
way around the world to help
bring science classes to life for
school-children in the Philippines-
but it might also be called the in-
ternational adventures of a burned-
out electric light bulb.
It was in January, 1952, that
Viktor Holbro left his native Basle
on a 15-month mission for Unesco
in the Philippines. In Manila, he
joined a Unesco technical assistance
team working with the Philippine
Government on a nation-wide pro-
gramme of expanding education.
As for the burned-out light bulb,
it first began its travels in 1951. It
was part of a"five-dollar labo-
ratory"of odds and ends that
accompanied another Unesco science
teacher, Dr. Ellsworth Obourn of
the United States, to Thailand.
Dr. Obourn had designed his labo-
ratory as a way out for schools and
teachers whose budgets could not
cover the cost of science laboratory
apparatus.
With tin cans, cigarboxes, rubber
bands and other assorted materials
available in forgotten closets,
Dr. Obourn had proved he could
duplicate the experiments of an
elementary science course. The
most important item in this kit was
the light bulb for, with its base filed
off, it could be transformed into
almost anything from a laboratory
flask to a water barometer.
On his way to the Philippines,
Mr. Holbro stopped off in Bangkok
to see what Dr. Obourn had been
able to accomplish with the light
bulbs and other cast-off items. The
results were promising, so much so
that science was already becoming a
living subject for Thai children in
classes where the equipment was
being used.
Then, in the Philippines, Mr. Hol-
bro found a strange situation.
"At first, I wondered why I had
come", he recalled in an interview
in Paris after his return from Ma-
nila."The Government had de-
by Daniel BEHRMAN
veloped an excellent philosophy of
science teaching on American lines
and they certainly did not need my
advice."
But Dr. Cecilio Putong, Philippine
Secretary of Education, took him
behind the scenes and the picture
was not so bright. Manila's schools
had suffered heavily during World
War II and science teaching
equipment had gone up in smoke.
A shortage of foreign exchange
made it impossible to replace this
equipment through new imports.
It was then that Mr. Holbro
decided to concentrate simply on
showing teachers how to make their
own apparatus so that science would
not remain a dry textbook subject.
A workshop was first opened for
teachers in Manila's Araullo High
School. Then each of the capital's
seven high schools sent one science
teacher and three teachers of
vocational education to Araullo for
training.
There, with the help of materials
brought in by Araullo's pupils in a
junk collection campaign, they went
to work, first learning how to
convert bulbs into flasks, tin cans
into tripods and ink bottles into
laboratory burners.
The rest was merely a question of
their own ingenuity. By the end of
their courses, teachers were pro-
ducing such complicated pieces of
equipment as manometers-that is,
pressure gauges-and steam engines.
In all, they were taught to construct
50 different models of laboratory
apparatus.
Meanwhile, Mr. Holbro also worked
with the Philippine School of Arts
and Trades in Manila, helping to set
up a small plant where vocational
training students went into pro-
duction on saleable supports, clamps,
test tube racks and demonstration
equipment. The school is now
working on its first order to supply
equipment to an educational centre
established by the Philippine Go-
vernment and Unesco at Bayambang,
130 miles north of Manila.
It is at Bayambang where science
teachers from all over the islands
are to be trained in the use of this
equipment and in applying it to their
teaching methods. Bayambang is
serving as a general training centre
in primary, secondary and adult
education.
Costs of this programme, Mr. Hol-
bro emphasized, are being borne
almost wholly by the Philippine Go-
vernment. His own work is being
carried forward by Tomas Tadana,
recently appointed by the Philip-
pines as the country's Superinten-
dent of Science Education, a new post
growing out of Mr. Holbro's work.
Blueprints of the light-bulb baro-
meter and other apparatus are now
being sent to schools throughout the
country.
The credit for this new approach
to science teaching belongs to the
Philippines, he believes..'They
knew what to do and what was
needed", he explained..'It was no
fault of their own that they did not
have the resources."
Mr. Holbro Is now returning to his
classroom at Basle's Madchengym-
nasium (Girl's College) where he
had previously taught physics and
chemistry for sixteen years. He
summed up. his stay in the Philip-
pines as a period of"mutual giving
and taking". As an educator, he was
especially impressed by the Philip-
pines'system of community schools
in which the school is playing a
major part in raising village living
, standards.
"That is one advantage of
teaching in a new country", he
commented."I hate to think what
would happen in Switzerland if a
boy came home from school and told
his father that the family's way of
raising chickens was all wrong".
These odds and ends are the nucleus of a laboratory which can bring elementary
science to life in a secondary school. Burned-out electric light bulbs serve as
flasks while tripods are cut from tin cans. Bunsen burner is an old ink bottle.

Seven wooden balls were strung from a frame... and physics came to life for these seven Philippine
schoolboys (above). This home-made apparatus demonstrates the principle of conservation of
impulse : when the left-hand ball hits the row, it sends the right-hand ball flying, but the centre ones
remain motionless. With the help of Viktor Holbro, a Swiss science professor sent to Manila on a
Unesco technical assistance mission, Philippine teachers learned to build this and similar apparatus
from odds and ends. They are now using it to perform experiments in their classe (blow). Mani-. r.-_1 _. ___I_______L--_. L.. _L. _-------
