UNESCO | the new Courier | May 2002
A new Courier
magazine you are holding is 
the trial issue of the new bi-annual
UNESCO Courier. We hope readers
will find it has the same rigorous standards and open-
minded approach that the old monthly magazine was
admired for over several decades. We also hope you like
the changes we have made such as:
■ A lighter and more flexible layout, lending itself to both 
a quick glance - at titles, intros, excerpts, captions, brief
items - and a good read.
■ New sections –such as Zoom, UNESCO in the news and
Partners– that will feature in each issue, giving different
angles on UNESCO’s various activities.
■ A new system of distribution too for a magazine that
is now free of charge, through UNESCO’s regional offices
and National Commissions, and the many other networks
the Organization is linked to around the world. The
magazine will be chiefly aimed at these key partners.
Each issue will include articles about topics linked to each
one of UNESCO’s fields of activity – education, culture,
communication, the social and exact sciences – written by
journalists from our Bureau of Public Information. It will
also contain a feature dossier put together by a specially
chosen guest editor. In this issue we discuss some of 
the major challenges to be faced in the 21st century and
next October we will focus on Afghanistan.
We wish you an interesting read and thank in advance
those of you who will send us comments, suggestions and
criticisms.

However the question of
rebuilding buddhas of

still on the agenda,
especially now that the site
has thrown up another

Taking their cue
from international
efforts to decode
the human
genome, an
international group
of taxonomists, led
by Edward O.
Wilson of Harvard
University, has
formed the All
Species Foundation
to complete a
global biodiversity
map within
25 years at an
estimated cost of
US $3 billion. The
aim is to build a
single catalogue of
every living
species, from
bacteria to
vertebrates, by
combining results
of individual
taxonomic projects
and hiring more
researchers in the
field. There are
now only about
10,000 active
taxonomists. Less
than two million
species have been
identified out of at
least 10 million and
perhaps as many
as 100 million.
The foundation
will also focus on
updating
taxonomic
techniques, notably
through the use of
new software.
Instead of sending
samples and slides
from one research
centre to another,
researchers could
use digital and 3-D
imaging techniques
to exchange and
verify data on new
species at a
fraction of the
current cost. By
2007, the
foundation hopes
to identify 60,000
new species every
year, up from the
current 15,000.
Chilling

Scientists have dug up
the oldest ice core ever
recorded, dating back
more than half a mil-
lion years, by drilling
about 3,000 metres
below East Antarctica.
Samples of the giant
core will now be
shipped to laboratories
across Europe in order
to help reveal the histo-
ry of the Earth’s cli-
mate and atmosphere
and predict future
changes. 
Dramatic events along
the peninsula foreshad-
owed the urgency of
this study. In mid
March, the Larsen B ice
shelf, which was
200 metres thick and
had a surface area of
3,250 km2, broke apart
in less than a month.
Scientists were shocked
by the speed of the col-
lapse and pointed to
atmospheric and ocean
warming, noting that
region has warmed
2.5 degrees in just
50 years. Just as Larsen
B collapsed, a monster
iceberg, spanning
5,500 km2, broke off
the western coast.

Education systems need reinventing. From the courses being taught 
to the schools they are taught in. Author and award winning journalist
Reva Klein is the Chair of the International Consortium on School
Disaffection, which aims at making education
more humane, and more relevant
What do you mean when you speak
of disaffected students?
 They’re the ones who slam the
door on their education. Not just the
kids who walk away from school, but
also the those who drop out in their
minds. The young people who feel
alienated from the school
environment or the curriculum for
example and who switch off, who’re
not engaged with the syllabus, not
engaged socially. In the education
system, they take one of four routes.
Either they are pushed out – excluded
– or they truant persistently, fail their
exams or drop out before taking
them. Whatever direction they go in ,
they face a precarious future, dogged
by stigma, no qualifications and low
self-esteem.
You’ve looked mainly at the situation
in the United Kingdom, the USA 
How serious is the problem in those
countries?
 In the UK, according to official
figures, nearly 20 percent of 14 to 19
year-olds are out-of-school without
any qualifications. They’re not in any
sort of vocational training, and
they’re not working. They’re referred
to as a being at “status zero”.
Unofficially, their numbers are
probably much higher. 
At the same time, and even though
the government has committed itself to
social inclusion, the number of pupils
being shown the door has risen
inexorably over the past decade. In
1990/91, 2,910 children were excluded
from English schools; by 1996/97 the
number had skyrocketed to 12,700, and
1,600 of them were primary students. 
In the United States, an average 25
percent of 13 year olds fail to graduate
from high school. But this figure hides
big differences between states and
cities. In New York City and
Washington D.C’s public schools, the
figure is a staggering 45 percent. This

means that one child out of every four
in the United States leaves school
without that most basic of American
necessities, a high school diploma.
Who are the young people 
dropping out?
 There are no simple profiles, but
there are a number of factors that
keep cropping up. 
The home and social environment
and family circumstances are
obviously critical. The US

example, reports that around half of
all families on welfare are headed by
early school leavers.
Race and ethnicity can also be major
hurdles. In the U.K. disproportionate
numbers of African Caribbean children
are doing badly – although they don’t
necessarily drop-out of their education.
Gypsy and Traveller children are
particularly at risk of failing and
dropping out, even though they, like
African Caribbeans, start their
schooling on a positive note. 
In the US, although the situation
for black children is still far from
acceptable, it has dramatically
improved over the last three decades.
The latest figures show that about 13
percent of young black students drop
out, as against 40 percent in the
1970s. On the other hand, the drop-
out rate for young Latinos in the mid
1990s was around 30 percent making
them the worst hit ethnic group for
dropout figures.
Gender is another indicator for
school disaffection and
underachievement. In the United
States, “special education” classes for
underachieving and disruptive
students ar-85 percent male.
Young people living in foster
situations or in the care of a local
authority are one of the highest risk
groups. In the UK over a quarter of
14 to 16 year olds in care are either
persistent truants or have been
excluded from school, and between
half and three quarters of those
leaving a foster or care situation have
no educational qualifications.
That’s not really surprising though.
Kids in underprivileged situations
have always faced these sorts of
difficulties. What’s new?
 First, although they probably
make up the bulk of dropouts and
disaffected students, young people in
socially difficult situations are not the
only ones that don’t make it. There
are plenty of “mom and pop” kinds
of kids who’re also dropping out, or
are disaffected. 
Perhaps what’s new though is our
concern over the situation, and our
understanding of the high cost of
disaffection. As an example, almost
95 percent of boys in young offender
institutions in the UK have either
been excluded from school,
persistently truanted or dropped out
before reaching their 16th birthday
(and every young offender costs at
least £75,000 per year to keep in
prison). Girls who become alienated
from school run an increased risk of
getting pregnant. Britain holds the
worst records in western Europe for
teenage pregnancies at 33 births for
every thousand girls aged between 15
and 19: five times the rate of Holland.
There is now widespread
acceptance of the fact that education
is fundamental to a person’s

development, their capacity to
survive and lead a fulfilling life in our
so-called knowledge societies – where
knowledge is the key to a country’s
economic and social development,
but also the key to individual
empowerment, to a decent job, home
and lifestyle. 
That we still have such a significant
dropout problem in those countries
that supposedly have the capacity to
provide an education for all, means
that what we are providing isn’t good
enough. It means that schools are not
in tune with what young people need
and want today. It means that teachers
are not well enough equipped with the
understanding and skills to deal with
the problems and difficulties of young
people; that schools are not providing
the right environment for children to
develop as citizens.
What can be done to reconnect 
kids with education?
 Clearly if the tide is to turn, so too
must policies, attitudes, structures.
The system must be more responsive
to the various needs, backgrounds
and abilities of all students while not
compromising standards and
expectations for the more able end of
the spectrum. The response must be
comprehensive in scope.
Concretely, that means designing
education systems that are more
flexible. It means making schools
truly democratic – and that goes
beyond the simple establishment of
school councils. We should be
striving for is real participation in the
classroom. We need to open schools
to the outside community and to
parents. And we need to pay much
more attention to individual children
and have mechanisms in place to get
them the expert help they need as
early as possible. Kids on the skids
need monitoring by properly trained
people. It’s been well established that
a “significant” adult in a child’s life
can turn them around.
Are there any examples that could
show us the way forward?
 There are plenty. In Europe,
Denmark’s education system takes
top marks. The system is based on
mutual respect between teacher and
pupil and a culture of dialogue: the
teachers don’t just stand up in front
of the class – children work with
them and with each other in a
collaborative effort. There’s no
grading system, no high stakes
testing. It’s a system that also offers
strong vocational programmes to
students. Denmark’s drop out rate is
only 4.3 percent.
While the US is home to some of
the worst results and practices, it is
also where some of the best work is
being done. In New Haven
(Connecticut), a compulsory
programme of social and emotional
learning for children from six to 18 –
teaching skills required for decision-
making, peer relationships, problem-
solving, resisting drugs and alcohol,
stress management, self-control,
violence prevention and sexuality –
has reaped amazing results. Between
1992 and 1996, the numbers of sixth
graders having to repeat a grade was
cut by ten percent. The number of
fourth graders achieving good or
excellent results in tests of their verbal
and non-verbal skills jumped from 41
to 72 percent. Dropout rates,
suspensions and exclusions all fell, the
number of kids carrying guns to
school dropped by half.
In Australia, multi-agency
approaches are turning up good
results. Schools are linking up with
public and private welfare
organizations and community groups
to bring kids in difficulty the support
services they and their parents may
need, and opening up different
learning opportunities. 
Cooperation, collaboration and
coherence are also the pillars of a
model being used successfully in
Holland, which aims to help young
people in difficulty to overcome some
of the disadvantages – economic and
cultural for example, that may hold
them back. The main idea is that the
fewer the differences between the
ethos and experiences at school, at
home and in the community, the
greater the progress of children’s
development. And because of the
enormous resources available to
schools, it is there where the ultimate
responsibility for creating educational
opportunities lies.

Aren’t these rather piecemeal
solutions for a problem that is
becoming more complex and truly
international?
 There are so many pedagogically
and psychologically sound approaches
being used in diverse corners of the
world to engage young people in their
learning that not a single spoke of yet
another wheel needs to be invented.
It’s all there for the taking, if we know
where to look for them and how to
adapt them to our particular needs. 
In an ideal world, for example, the
education system in Taiwan, say, will
admit that though it produces top
marks internationally in math and
science, the creative expression of the
children there has been sacrificed in
the process to their detriment. So it
will look to, for example, a school in
Tennessee (USA) using the Leonard
Bernstein Center model, in which the
curriculum is delivered through the
arts, and borrow some of the
methodologies from there. At the
same time, pre-school educators in
Britain will reassess the wisdom of
introducing literacy and numeracy to
four year olds and look at Hungary,
where children attain higher test
scores although they start reading
and number work two to three years
later. And in the same hour, a
secondary school in Caracas
(Venezuela) with a heavy caseload of
truancy, underachievement and
disruptive behaviour will look to the
multi-agency support systems
practiced in Western Australia. There,
no child is left to suffer or drift off,
because assessment of all students
ensures that a myriad of problems are
identified and dealt with in different,
student-friendly ways.
Children of the future, like those of
the present, will need to communicate
well, to interact at sophisticated levels
with others, to solve problems
creatively and to be flexible and
imaginative in their thinking. For that
to happen, schools need to see them
and treat them as individuals, helping
them to deal with the baggage that
they’re bringing in with them
everyday and stimulating them so that
they will want to learn. For unless
school learning is seen as part of a
continuum in the context of each
child’s life, it will remain stuck in the
19th century, where it remained for
most of the 20th.
The International Consortium
on School Disaffection, was
created last October under the
auspices of the National Dropout
Prevention Centre based in
Clemson, South Carolina (USA).
Reva Klein is the chair.
The consortium is a multi-
disciplinary group of academics,

The destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan in March 2001 was
described by UNESCO as a “crime against culture”.
In the weeks preceding the blasting of the two giant statues, protesting voices were
raised across the world - to no avail - to try to stop the action of the Taliban. Since
then, the press has frequently reported initiatives proposed for the reconstruction 
of the statues.
A final decision on this has yet to be taken, but one thing is certain:
no people can live without a past. In other words cultural heritage,
whether it is tangible or intangible, plays a fundamental role in the
way that a people constructs a history, an identity and a common
purpose. Because of this, cultural heritage deserves the attention of
all architects of peace, in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
In Cambodia for example, Angkor has always held out the dream
of unity, especially during the nation’s darkest days. Far from wiping
out the memory of the former empire, the Angkar, meaning
Organization, which was the supreme body of the Khmer Rouge, used it to feed its
nationalist propaganda. But for the past decade, the symbolic significance of Angkor
has above all helped the Cambodians to become reconciled with each other 
and with themselves.
In Bosnia, the systematic destruction of cultural heritage during the war was 
an attempt to eliminate any trace of the shared past of the various Serb, Croat and
Muslim communities. Today, UNESCO and the World
Bank are coordinating the work of multi-cultural 
teams to rebuild the Mostar bridge. But for the bridge 
to really become “a symbol of peace and reconciliation”
the residents on the opposing banks of the Neretva 
River have got to want to cross it.

Angkor’s role in the
search for a lost unity
“When I pray here, my spirit flies up to
heaven and I see Buddha,” says
78-year-old Heanj Tan, as she valiantly climbs
down the perilous stone steps of Bayon, the main
temple of Angkor Thom. This elderly woman,
illiterate and with failing eyesight, seems happy to
be detached from the Earth, where she has seen so
much death. All her family disappeared, some of
them massacred “under Pol Pot’s regime”
(1975–1979). She survived and prayed often in the
pagoda of Kompong Chnang until one day Angkor
Wat appeared to her in a dream.
“It was two years ago,” she says. “I saw the wat
(pagoda in Khmer) very clearly, in my eyes and in
my heart, and I came here.” 
Heanj Tan’s devotion is not necessarily shared by
all the Cambodians who flock to Angkor with the
foreign tourists. Alongside a large number of
monks, we came across a waitress who had come
from Phnom Penh “just to visit”, or a young lawyer
who came because he is proud of his culture. And
there was also the father of an affluent family, who
was conscious that a visit to Angkor is a external
sign of social prestige. The number of Cambodian
visitors exceeded 120,000 in 2000 and is rising
every year.
Why do so many people visit Angkor? The return
of peace in 1998 and the demining of the site, has
allowed Cambodians to travel there in safety. But in
a country which is struggling to cast off decades of
nightmares and humiliation – civil war, genocide,
Vietnamese occupation – the memory of Angkor
soothes a shattered nation.

“The last 25 years have been a period of
intense philosophical reflection for the
Cambodians,” says Azzedine Beschaouch,
UNESCO’S Scientific Advisor for Angkor. “They
have asked themselves whether the decline of
the Angkor empire (9th to the 14th century)
signalled the end of a Cambodia that was
peaceful and highly cultured, and whether they
themselves were part of another Cambodia, one
which is destructive and barbaric. Angkor above
all allows them to be reconciled with their own
history: aligning themselves to this great
civilisation allows them to draw a line under
the barbaric times.”
“Angkor is the soul of the Khmer,” adds Ang
Chouléan, an anthropologist and the director of
culture at APSARA, the national agency in
charge of the site’s development (see box).
“In times of despair, Angkor is the only
reference point.”
It is a religious symbol, the mythical base of
the “Khmer nation” and therefore a national
emblem. Since independence in 1953, Angkor
Wat has featured on Cambodia’s national flag. 
Ang Chouléan recalls that in 1991, when the
four warring parties created the Supreme
National Council in order to reunite the country,
“the first thing that the Council did was to
appeal to the international community to
safeguard Angkor.”
In December 1992, the site was inscribed on
UNESCO’s World Heritage List, an act Ang
Chouléan says sealed “the start of the process
of national reconciliation”. Since then, Angkor
has loomed large whenever peace in the
country needed propping up. In 1993, when
King Norodom Sihanouk returned to the throne,
the first decree he signed – NS 001 – regulated
the protection of the archaeological site.
American anthropologist Ashley Thompson
underlines that after the events of July 1997 as
Cambodia once again tottered on the brink of
chaos, it was to Angkor that the king turned to
“pay homage to the statues” and to appeal for
reconciliation.
However, the control of the former capital and
the tourist boom that it has led, have given rise
to dissent in some quarters.
“On one hand, Angkor has shown
Cambodians that they can earn a lot of money
by working together but, on the other hand, it
has caused numerous tensions,” says Tamara
Teneishvili from UNESCO’s Bureau in Phnom
Penh.
Property developers are holding up the
introduction of town planning rules designed to
protect the area around the site and the
neighbouring town of Siem Reap, which has
almost doubled in size in 10 years. And the
residents of the 75 villages in the archeological
park, and the long-term residents of Siem Reap
have see more and more people moving into the
region from other provinces to get a share of the
profits.
The gold mine generated by ticket sales for
Angkor is also a source of bitter dispute. The
number of foreign visitors has increased greatly
since 1998 (see graph), pushing ticket receipts
beyond US$5 million dollars in 2000, compared
Angkor is a symbol of national unity but also an example
of “international solidarity”, says Etienne Clément, the
director of UNESCO’s Bureau in Phnom Penh. “Angkor has
benefited from the sort of international cooperation which
is unique in the history of heritage conservation,” he says.
Since the site was inscribed on the World Heritage List ten
years ago, UNESCO has taken over the office of secretary
of the International Coordination Committee charged with
safeguarding and developing the site. This committee,
made up of 35 states and international organizations, is
jointly presided over by France and Japan, the two biggest
contributors to efforts to safeguard the site. Every year, the
committee supervises around 100 projects, worth a total of
five million dollars, covering research, restoration, training,
community development and tourism.
After helping the Cambodian authorities to define the
layout of a site of more than 400km2, UNESCO encouraged
the creation of APSARA in 1995. This Authority for the
Protection of the Site and the management of the region of
Angkor, whose acronym refers to the renowned celestial
dancers which are engraved in stone there, has set up a
range of projects, mainly related to tourism, town planning
and the maintenance of the monuments.

The wanton pillage
of Angkor has been
much reduced
thanks to the efforts
of the Heritage
Police, set up in 1994
with UNESCO’s help
with US$1.8 million in 1999. Since April 1999, a
private company, Sokha Hotels, has held the
concession to sell tickets. It takes a cut of
almost 40 percent of the proceeds. The rest goes
to the Public Treasury, which is supposed to
pay it back to APSARA, the tourism ministry
and the culture ministry. The agreement has
already been revised once and a new review
will take place this year.
“All the donors who have contributed to the
development and protection of the site,
regularly denounce the situation,” says Etienne
Clément, the director of UNESCO’s Bureau in
Phnom Penh. He points out that elsewhere in
the world, companies running the ticket
operations for public monuments are rarely
allowed to keep more than 15 percent of the
receipts. But to place the situation in context,
he observes that prior to April 1999, “all the
money disappeared into a black hole”.
“In Cambodia, the tradition of transparency in
public finances is a very recent thing,” says
Etienne Clément, choosing his words carefully.
“Why don’t we let APSARA collect the ticket
receipts?” says Son Soubert, an archaeologist
and a member of the Constitutional Council.
“Because, as everyone knows,” he alleges
“Sokha finances the Prime Minister’s party.”
He says the situation is all the more serious
because the culture ministry lacks the necessary
resources to fight against the pillaging of
archaeological sites. The theft and the
trafficking of the heads of statues and bas-reliefs
continue in a number of provinces, even though
these practices have been stopped in the Angkor
park, thanks to tourism and the Heritage Police,
which was set up in 1994 with UNESCO’s
support.
The Angkor temples, representing the cosmos
and the order of gods, have always symbolised
the aspiration for unity and harmony,” says
Ashley Thompson. The Cambodians like them
so much because they represent the possibility
of transcending the divisions of history and the
failings of humanity.

part of the common
heritage of Serbs,
Croats and Muslims that disappeared during the
war in Bosnia could help to start the long
process of healing the wounds opened by the
conflict. To this end, UNESCO is helping to
rebuild Mostar’s Old Bridge, a jewel of Ottoman
architecture, to make it once more a symbol of
that heritage of peaceful coexistence.
But reconciliation is no easy task in a city that
lost more than 2,000 of its inhabitants in fighting
between the three communities from 1992 to
1995. The traces of war are still very visible.
Near what used to be the front line, many
bombed buildings are still derelict and bear signs
warning of the danger of going near them. Holes
in the roads and pavements made by shells and
houses pock-marked with bullets are a reminder
everywhere of the bloody conflict.
Soldiers of the SFOR international peace force
still patrol the town daily, along with Italian
carabinieri, French gendarmes and Spanish civil
guards. But those who knew the city during the
fighting say things have much improved. 
Although the divide between the Croatian
part of the town (along the west bank of the
Neretva river) and the neighbourhood of the
majority Bosnian-Muslim population (on the
other side of the river) is still clear, three of the
nine bridges destroyed in the area during the
war are back in operation. But the most famous
one, that gave the city its name (Mostar means
“keeper of the bridge”), is still a makeshift foot
crossing.
The Stari Most (Old Bridge), built in 1566 by
the Ottoman architect Mimar Hayreddin, was
destroyed by Croatian artillery on 9 November
1993. But the bridge lives on in the old part of
the town, where artists paint it and craft
workers make miniature copies of it in metal,
ceramics and leather. Restaurants and radio
stations are named after it and you can see it on
postcards all over the town.

Mostar, a bridge 
to peace
But the memory of it burns brightest in
people’s hearts. “When I dream about the war, I
never see my father or my brother, I always see
the bridge,” says Selma, a 27-year-old widow.
“When I used to go out with friends, we’d
always arrange to meet up at the bridge. We
just called it ‘Stari’ (the Old Man),” says
Snjezana Hadzic, a civil engineer who is a
consultant with the reconstruction project.
Every August, the town’s youngsters would
dive off the top of the bridge’s 20-metre-high
single arch into the Neretva in a contest that
was shown on nationwide Yugoslav television.
“When it was destroyed, I was the mayor, and
we all wept,” says Cisic Rusmir, head of the Old
Bridge Project Coordination Unit, which is
funded by the World Bank and brings together
international, Croatian and Bosnian experts.
“But I was also there a week later when it was
decided to rebuild it. The aim of the agreement
we’ve signed with the World Bank and UNESCO
is to build a new bridge just like the old one,
using exactly the same kind of stone, but on
Tens of thousands of books, manuscripts and
periodicals went up in flames in Sarajevo on the
night of August 25 1992 after the bombing of the

“Many people who hastened to deplore its
destruction had never been inside the place,” says
young Bosnian writer Nenad Velickovic, nearly 10
years after the event. “The worst thing is that since
then, it’s become a kind of international badge of
good conscience. Orchestras and

condition that members of both rival commu-
nities work together on the project.
“We have only one bank account and one set
of documents. I have complete confidence in
my Croatian architect opposite number, Tihomir
Rosic. If only all the institutions in Bosnia-
Herzegovina showed the same degree of
cooperation.”
SIDE BY SIDE
Members of both communities have worked
side by side for more than two years in quarries
and excavation sites. Sharing the goal of
completing such a highly symbolic project for
the town, drinking coffee and taking work-
breaks together is all helping them to stop
seeing each other as enemies.
This is no small achievement in a town where
SFOR soldiers say Bosnian-Muslim and Croatian
police patrol side by side in the same uniform
sometimes without exchanging a word for
weeks and where the hatred simmering just
below the surface means proceeding very
carefully because so many families who lost
loved ones know the names of those who
killed them.
Italy, Turkey, France, the Netherlands and
other foreign donors have provided the US $15
million needed to rebuild the bridge and its two
towers and also restore 11 buildings in the old
part of town that were badly damaged in the
fighting. Of the total, US $2 million is coming
from the Mostar town council and recently the
Croatian government said it would give
US $660,000 for the new bridge.
“This is a remarkable gesture from a country
with economic problems, especially since the
local Bosnia-Herzegovina press has kept quiet
about it,” says Colin Kaiser, head of UNESCO’s
office in Sarajevo.
Ivo Andric, the only Nobel Prizewinner for
Literature that former Yugoslavia produced,
wrote in 1945 that “bridges are more important
than houses and more sacred than temples,
because everyone uses them and they belong to
everyone.”
It is up to the different communities in
Mostar to make sure that when the new bridge
opens in 2004, it fulfils Andric’s description.

“The problem with the library is the same as with
many other civilian buildings in the region,” says
Léon Pressouyre.1 “It’s who owns the land. There’ve
already been cases where the international
community has been quick to fund restoration and
renovation, only to have the real or bogus former
owners appear, waving titles to the land. Before
doing any such work on the library, it’s vital for local
authorities to come to an agreement about the future
use of the land.”
Meanwhile, UNESCO is providing US $220,000 to
renovate the temporary premises and has helped to
restore one of the library’s most famous
manuscripts, the “Sarajevo Haggadah”, a 15th
century book of Jewish prayer.
In the 1960s, the bridge and its approaches were a place
of leisure where the different communities mixed freely.

Usinghuman embryos as a source
of spare body parts is an
idea that both fascinates and terrifies. We are
drawn by its promise. We are also frightened,
because it has changed too quickly from
science fiction to being real science and
because we feel those involved in it have new
and fearsome powers through their knowledge
of how to alter living organisms.
The idea of beating an illness such as
Parkinson’s disease by replacing old or
damaged cells with new and efficient ones
taken from an embryo is by no means the only
one that life sciences offer us these days.
Other possibilities, on the contrary, are
downright alarming. They include, for
example, reproductive cloning of human
beings, which some scientists and doctors say
they are determined to press ahead with
despite its prohibition by both UNESCO’s 1997
Universal Declaration on the Human Genome
and Human Rights – which calls it “contrary
to human dignity” (article 11) – and the laws
of many countries.
To the already tough question posed by life
sciences of “how far shall we go?” we must
add another: “how far do we have the right to
go?” This is the extremely broad domain of
bioethics. So what are the ajor problems it
faces today?
Embryonic stem cell research could allow
production of what we desperately lack –
organs, tissue and cells for transplants – that
give hope of spectacular progress in the battle
against ailments that are difficult or currently
impossible to cure, such as Parkinson’s,
Alzheimer’s disease and Multiple Sclerosis.
The legitimacy of such research – which
countries either ban, permit or simply tolerate
– depends first of all on the status given to the
embryo. If considered to be already a human
being, its use obviously cannot be envisaged,
even for respectable medical treatment. But
the debate goes further than this. Though not
against the idea of using human embryos as a
source of ESC, some people object to it in
practice because of the danger of abuses and
misuse of the embryo in the course of such
research. Even those who consider it ethically
acceptable are often concerned to establish
safeguards and conditions about using them
for medical purposes..
Other questions arise about the source of
ESC. Is it right to create human embryos just
for research purposes? And if the only
embryos used are those no longer intended to
grow into children (such as embryos frozen
after in vitro fertilisation), how should the
acceptability of the research be judged and
how can the rights of the donor parents be
respected? Ultimately, other questions must be
asked. Do these cells, with their great
potential for replication, risk becoming
cancerous? If so, how can this be dealt with?
Several countries that banned ESC research
(Germany and France, for example) have or
appear to be switching to a more liberal
position. Also, while the most promising cells
seem to be ESC (totipotent ones), cells taken
from adults (ASC –only multipotent but raising
fewer ethical issues) are making a come-back
after discoveries in Canada and Sweden.
The prospect of human cloning has also set
off intense debate. Although the international
community has already rejected the idea as an
unacceptable misuse of human beings, the
threat remains. Certain scientists and doctors
have dismissed the widespread objections and

Genetic data:
gathering,
processing,
storing
and use 
The collection, treatment, storage
and use of genetic material raise a host
of ethical problems. They include the
purpose of gathering it, informing
sample donors, obtaining their free
and informed consent, regard for the
sensitivity of some social, religious or
ethnic groups about genetic testing
(for such things as parentage),
confidentiality and what happens 
to the samples gathered.
The spread of genetic
“fingerprinting” could lead to all kinds
of discrimination. First against people
whose genes showed an anomaly
indicating an existing disease or the
predisposition for one. This could put
them at risk of being barred from jobs,
being refused or charged more for
insurance, and blacklisted by credit
organizations. There might be more
general discrimination if a genetic
survey of a given population led to
stigmatisation of entire groups.
As data banks spring up all over the
place and genetic and medical data
about whole populations passes into
the hands of private firms with
exclusive rights, the issue of genetic
data needs to be urgently tackled.
UNESCO’s International Bioethics
Committee is working on this and has
produced a report.* An international
instrument is being prepared and a
first meeting about it was held at
UNESCO headquarters in Paris on
11-12 February this year. The IBC’s
drafting committee will work over the
next few months on a proposal to
present to the IBC before the end of
the year.

Technological advances have brought a new
kind of diagnosis that has its own dangers:
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, which not
only detects gender but countless other
characteristics. The fear is that this technology
– currently limited to spotting serious diseases
– will be used for eugenic purposes, for
“selecting” human beings. 
The status of the human genome is at the
root of another big question: who owns
genetic data? The person who provides parts
of hisor her genetic material? The scientist
who identifies its characteristics? The scientist
who devises a use for it? The company that
paid for the research? And the problem is no
easier if the organism supplying genetic data is
a plant rather than a person. Should scientists

life reward the local witch doctor, or his
community, who led them to the plant?
RESERVED FOR THE RICH
In theory, only genuine inventions that have a
purpose or might have industrial uses can be
patented, but in fact there is an upsurge in
patent applications for genomes and their
uses, including gene sequences, whose future
usefulness is unclear. According to the draft
report on the follow-up to the international
symposium on Ethics, Intellectual Property
and Genomics the rocketing number of patents
being granted means that “the costs of future
therapies and genetic tests will become
prohibitive for most human beings and
nations.”
Should these “discoveries” be protected, thus
depriving some people of their possible
benefits? Or should intellectual property
protection in this area be reduced, at the risk of
deterring corporate investment because of
diminishing profitability? Although genetic
discoveries compound this problem, it is not a
new one, as shown by the debate over the cost
of AIDS drugs, which are protected by patents
and therefore too expensive for some countries.
The question of equity also arises in the area
of donating human organs and tissue. Scientific
advances, such as xenotransplantation (trans-
plants of genetically-altered animal organs into
say they are determined to go ahead with
cloning. The prospect looms of “cloning
havens,” not unlike today’s “tax havens.” If this
situation were ever to result in the birth of a
human clone that survived, another grave
question would arise: what would be the legal
position of a cloned human being “conceived”
or “born” in a country where such a practice
was banned?
There are also questions about therapeutic
cloning, which involves transferring a nucleus
to create an embryo simply to provide stem
cells. Is this acceptable if it can vanquish
incurable or crippling diseases? Does accepting
human cloning for these purposes (and
developing the necessary techniques) leave the
way wide open for reproductive cloning of
human beings? Here we come up against the
problem already mentioned: when does
human life start? .
Less-frequently posed questions such as
diagnosis (the core of medical practice) are
just as ethically important. Bioethics has
already been confronted with the question or
pre-natal diagnosis, and how to prevent it
from being used to determine the sex of a
The IBC,
leading the way
Currently headed by Ryuichi Ida, professor of law at
Japan’s Kyoto University, the International Bioethics
Committee (IBC) was set up by UNESCO in 1993 to
follow the progress of research in the life sciences and
its applications by ensuring that the principles of human
dignity and freedom are respected. The IBC is the only
global forum which can facilitate in-depth ethical
reflection by exposing the issues at stake. However it is
not the IBC’s role to act as a tribunal passing judgement
on one position or another. It is up to each country,
particularly the legislators, to reflect societal choices
within the framework of national legislation and to
decide between the different positions. The Committee
comprises 36 members, designated by UNESCO’s
Director-General, and who serve is a personal capacity.
The IBC was the author of the Universal Declaration on
the Human Genome and Human Rights, adopted by
UNESCO in 1997, which is still the only international
instrument in the field.

a human body), and genetic engineering in
animals as a potential source of organs
compatible with the human body may mean
the imbalance between supply and demand can
be restored. But this will be at a heavy price
mostly for poor countries. This takes us to the
broader ethical problem of solidarity. Since the
human genome is, according to the first article
of the Universal Declaration on the Human
Genome and Human Rights, part of the
“heritage of humanity,” should not the benefits
of this research – mainly done in rich countries
often using material from elsewhere – be better
shared?
Finally, there is the problem of what to do
with all the genetic data gathered in the
course of all the discoveries that promise both
remedies and future dangers. Such material
ranges from initial biological samples, the
isolated DNA, records of DNA sequences,
genetic profiles and information about the
state of the chromosomes. It can also include
written family medical records. The collection,
treatment, storage and use of this genetic
material – which determines a person’s
genetic identity and is passed down through
generations – also raises very many ethical
problems (see box p.21). The International
Bioethics Committee (IBC) has published
several reports on this and UNESCO has begun
work this year on drawing up international
guidelines in the field.

Alexandria’s library
rises again
UNESCO and communication Promoting dialogue
Sixteen centuries after it disappeared, the
biggest library of ancient times is
coming back to life in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The
library where the Bible’s Old Testament was first translated
from Hebrew into Greek and where Euclid invented
geometry.
“It’s wonderful that amid so many wars around the
world, and when people are talking about the ’clash of
civilisations,’ that a few metres from where the old library
was, a new and wonderful institution is rising that’s also
dedicated to universal knowledge, understanding and
tolerance,” says its director, Ismail Serageldin.
The official opening of the new library had been
scheduled for April 23, World Book and Copyright Day.
However, events in the Middle East forced a postponement.
The library is noetheless ready to go. It is the biggest such
institution in the Middle East and Africa, with room for
eight million books and equipped with state-of-the-art
information technology, including a section for digitally
scanning manuscripts. Its physical design is also unique.
“The building is conceived as a solar disc rising out of the
ground and looking towards the sea, symbolising the
openness and vastness of knowledge,” says Serageldin.
“Like the Sydney Opera House or the Guggenheim
Museum, it has its own very distinct character.”
A new, hi-tech temple of knowledge 
for the city founded by Alexander the Great 
on the shores of the Mediterranean   
One of the world’s biggest and most modern libraries opens its doors

“Our primary vocation is the Mediterranean and then
the Arab World and Africa,” he says. “We’re going to
develop close ties with institutions such as the University
of Alexandria, Senghor University, the Arab Academy
of Science and Technology and the Egyptian Centre
for Creativity. We will focus on researching the history
of the old library, the ethics of science and technology
and studying water as a development issue.”
As a trained architect, Serageldin is keen to talk about
the building itself: “It was designed by a group of very
talented young Norwegian architects (from the firm
Snohetta) and construction was supervised by an
outstanding Egyptian engineer, Mamdouh Hamza, who
faced the challenge of building part of it 18 metres below
sea-level. You can approach the building without feeling
crushed and you don’t realise it’s 160 metres across and
11 storeys high. It’s surrounded by a wall in the shape of a
half-moon, on which are carved letters from the alphabets
of 120 languages. The overall effect is sedate, human,
open and elegant.”
Serageldin, a Moroccan academic, is most proud of the
great reading hall, “one of the most beautiful in the world,”
he says. “The soft mellow daylight reaches everywhere and
the ceiling elevated on very elegant columns creates an
atmosphere of a ’cathedral of learning,’ as someone put it.”
Looking down on the reading hall from the Callimachus
Triangle, a vantage point from where you can see the
building’s seven levels, he adds confidently that “in future,
people won’t come to Egypt to see the Pyramids. They’ll
come to see this library.”
He firmly rejects criticism of the project’s cost: “The final
cost was US$220 million, US$97.6 million of which was
provided by the outside world and the remainder by the
Egyptian government. For a country of 67 million people,
US$120 million over a 10 years isn’t an unreasonable
investment for a centre of excellence.”
The Ptolemies were also criticised in their time, says
Serageldin, but history proved them right. “The
contribution of the Ancient Library of Alexandria to the
knowledge of the world, to the patrimony of the whole
human race, continues to this day to inspire us as one the
greatest adventures of the human mind.”
Restoring a link with that noble tradition is what gives
the project its universal character. “It’s wonderful to see
the excitement of thousands of people all over the world
at the inauguration of the library, which they feel belongs
to them as much as to Egypt,” says Serageldin.
Asbel Lopez
As well as the library itself and a spectacular reading hall
for 1,700 people, there is a conference centre that can hold
3,500 people, a planetarium, five research institutions, an
Internet centre, three museums and four art galleries. For
Serageldin, it’s much more than a library, rather “a vast
international cultural centre,” comparable to the Museion –
part of the ancient library and the University of Alexandria
and the gathering place for poets, scientists and artists.
Founded by Ptolemy I Soter in 288 BC, the ancient library
contained nearly 700,000 manuscripts. It was there that
Aristarchus suggested for the first time that the Earth
revolved round the Sun, where Eratosthenes calculated the
circumference of the Earth and Herophilus discovered that
the brain controlled the body. After 450 years, the library
disappeare, the victim of attacks and fires - the first of them
in 48 BC, when Caesar backed Cleopatra against her
brother Ptolemy XIII.
But this glorious past doesn’t intimidate Serageldin. “I
want to make the new library into a meeting-place where
thinkers, artists and scientists from all over the world can
lay the foundation of mutual understanding through
dialogue,” he says.

UNESCO helped give an international dimension to
the scheme to build the Alexandria Library.
“UNESCO’s international backing was crucial to this
project going forward,” says, Ismail Serageldin, the
library’s director.
In 1987, UNESCO launched an international appeal
to support “the revival of the Ancient Library of
Alexandria” and paid for a feasibility study that said
a big library should supply the needs of the
Mediterranean region. A year later, together with the
International Union of Architects (IUA) and the UN
Development Programme (UNDP), UNESCO
announced an international competition to design the
library. It also organised the Aswan Meeting in 1990,
where it got the first international funding for the
project – US$65 million, mainly from Arab countries.
UNESCO has provided an Internet server and money
to set up the library’s website. It has also funded an
electronic library for blind people and the training of
librarians, as well as providing technical documents
and guidelines for designing the library’s information
systems and buying equipment. In addition, it has
put together a curriculum for the International School
for Information Studies, based at the library, and set
up a restoration laboratory.

Here’sa surprise - there are more 
plant species in a fifty
kilometre radius around New York City than an
area of Nebraska farmland the same size. And
here’s an irony - New Yorkers eat the equivalent
of Nebraska’s entire wheat production in bread
and pasta every year. These topsy-turvy
statistics are only a taster of what is emerging
as scientists turn their attention to cities, no
longer viewing them as asphalt deserts, but as
complex ecological systems in their own right -
including their dominant species, man.
And this interest also parallels a change
in the way scientists are thinking about
environmental conservation today. They are
progressively abandoning the ideal of pristine
wilderness sites, moving towards goals
of sustainable development, that includes

they emphasise the role of the City’s biological
diversity in reducing negative impacts of global
warming. And over the past two years, these

Man and Biosphere programme, to see if it can
provide useful research and planning tools.

“The biosphere reserve concept (see box)
and the world network of biosphere reserves
have usually been associated with more
pristine, scarcely populated environments,”
says Christine Alfsen-Norodom, of UNESCO’s
Man and Biosphere Programme, who is
coordinating the project in New York.
“Never before has the biosphere reserve
concept been examined in terms of its direct
relevance or usefulness to a mega-city,
like New York.”
But for Pietro Garau, Director of the UN
Center for Human Settlements (Habitat)
European Office, it’s not necessarily a city’s
green spaces that make it ecologically
interesting. Speaking at a conference last year
in New York on “Biodiversity and Society”,
Garau pointed out that “a ‘passenger’ in the city
uses less land and energy than a rural
‘passenger’. In a ’no-city’ planet, if we divided
all available land by the number of inhabitants,
each ‘passenger’ would be using 2.16 hectares
in 2001. But with population growth, this would
become 1.4 hectares by 2050. So the ‘no-city’
model is not sustainable.” And, he added,
provocatively, “cities may be the best we have
for saving the planet’s environment.”
In fact, urban environments can provide a
variety of habitats for plants and animals,
sometimes mimicking natural conditions. Tall
stone buildings can resemble cliffs, while lawns
are like savanna. And there are some unique
inner-city places, not often frequented by
people, where even rare animals and plants can
thrive, such as ancient churchyards, or disused
railway lines, as well as abandoned factories
and other brownfield sites. 
ON THE WATERFRONT
New York City’s waterfront geography also gives
it some unique natural features. Much of the
city, for example, is built on prehistoric swamp
and salt marsh, similar to that still found in
Jamaica Bay, within sight of Wall Street (see
map). “Traditionally,” says Bill Solecki,
“wetlands have been used as sacrifice areas to
build airports, waste dumps, or whatever.” But,
he warns, “the greatest biodiversity in the city
is found at the water’s edge. And it is also the
area most vulnerable to climate change.”
Shortly after UNESCO set up the Man and Biosphere
Programme in 1968 it invited member states to submit
proposals for the first biosphere reserves. These were to be
experimental sites, attempting to strike a balance between
the apparently conflicting goals of conserving biological
diversity, promoting sustainable economic and social
development and maintaining associated cultural values.
Since then, a network of some 409 reserves has grown up
in 94 countries. 
Traditionally, biosphere reserves are organised
geographically into three separate zones - core, buffer and
transition. In the core area, critical habitats and biodiversity
are protected. The buffer zone is there to protect the core,
while the transition area serves as an intermediate zone
between the buffer and the surrounding region.
In the past, nearly all biosphere reserves have been in
relatively remote, natural areas. But since the late 1990’s
MAB has been looking at ways to extend the biosphere
reserve concept to urban areas. One of the difficulties is to
know where to locate the “core” area in a city reserve.
Some argue it could even lie outside the city, in the more
pristine hinterland. But researchers running a case study in
New York (see main article) have suggested the waterfront
area; it is the most fragile and active in terms of biodiversity,
but, historically, also the most important economically.
Member states themselves have to nominate areas as
biosphere reserves and there are no official plans for New
York at present. The concept could be a useful toolkit for
discussion and research, though.

into the hinterland, there is a move to “green”
downtown areas. Since 1978 community
gardening associations, like Green Thumb, have
planted some 700 productive vegetable and flower
gardens on over 60 hectares of vacant lots,
according to its founder, Jane Weissman. And
heated discussions are going on about what to do
with the “Ground Zero” site left by the World
Trade Center disaster last September. “Developers
in NYC are stating that rebuilding commercial
developments at Ground Zero is a national duty,”
says Alfsen-Norodom. “But their haste shows their
fear that, in a wounded city, people may aspire
to alternative uses of a space made highly
symbolic by its very destruction.” 
Popular support seems to be moving towards a
cultural use of the space, which cuts across the
“nature” versus “concrete” divide. And the
cultural diversity of New York is going to need to
find its place in any biosphere model of the city
alongside biological diversity. This could be what
will set the New York case study apart from other
studies of urban ecology going on in the USA at
the moment, such as those in Baltimore and
Phoenix, Arizona funded by the US National
Science Foundation (see: www.lternet.edu/sites/).
Meanwhile, armed with the Metro East Coast
Report, city planners have realised that what is left
of the City’s nature is not just pretty. It could help
save New Yorkers from going to work in a rowing
boat, if, as predicted, the threat of floods will
increase with global warming. Christopher Zeppie,
of the Port Authority, at a launch for the report,
called for planners to be more proactive: “The
stone age did not end because the human race ran
out of stone.”

Salt marshes naturally act as a buffer against
sea level rise, one of the most immediate threats
to New York City with global warming. But when
Ellen Hartig, a wetlands consultant, compared
archive and recent photos of Jamaica Bay, she
found the marshes had shrunk by 12 percent
since 1959 – and up to 60 percent in some small
island areas. “In one Long Island bay, there were
13 islands at one point,” she says. “Now there
are only seven. Six are submerged.” The marshes,
she explains, would usually compensate for sea
level rise by “retreating” inland. But since the
waterfront has been built upon, the marshes can
no longer adapt, making the developed areas
prone to flooding, while killing species of salt-
marsh grasses that cannot survive in deep water.
AS THE CITY SPRAWLS 
ITS CENTRE GETS GREENER
The complex interactions between man and
environment in an urban setting like New York,
argues Solecki, can only be understood – and
therefore mastered – if the city is viewed as 
a complete ecological system. From this
perspective, then, the flood protection offered by
salt marshes is one of the natural “goods and
services” for which New Yorkers will have to pay
if the marshes disappear. To compensate for the
loss of this protection, city planners are already
having to think about artificial flood barriers,
while the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey has elevated JFK’s main runway
once and may have to do so again. Similarly,
the trees and green spaces of Central Park reduce
air pollution levels, as well as the “heat island
effect”, where the combination of heat-absorbing
concrete and human activity causes temperatures
in the city to rise. 
And as the city sprawls, the natural goods and
services upon which residents depend are coming
from increasingly far away. In 1992 the Canadian
economist, William Rees coined the term
“ecological footprint”, to refer to the amount of
productive land needed to sustain a city’s
population and its levels of consumption. This is
usually found in the local hinterland. But in a city
like New York, the “footprint” might include parts
of Nebraska, where acres of prairie are turned into
wheat and potato fields, or even South American
coffee plantations. Ironically, as the city chomps

On a bright May morning in the
Ramble, a wooded area of New
York’s Central Park, birdwatchers can
almost outnumber the birds. This is
the time of year that hundreds of
tiny, colourful warblers from as far
away as Mexico and Bolivia, stop off
in Manhattan to feed, on their long
migration to the forests of Canada.
And if the whole park suddenly
comes alive with the din of birds’
alarm calls, one of the city’s resident
Peregrine falcons is probably
overhead.
By the 1960’s peregrine falcons had
disappeared from the state of New
York – victims of the pesticide, DDT –
until a project to reintroduce them in
the 1980’s. But no-one expected
these mountain birds to move into
the city, building their nests on
Brooklyn Bridge. Now as many as

Quality and Quantity
Education for all means more than getting all children into school. It also
means giving them a quality education. New reports from UNESCO’s Institute
of Statistics show both goals are still distant in Latin America and Africa 
UNESCO and education Towards education for all
An estimated two million primary-age 
children and 20 million secondary-
age children in Latin America don’t attend
primary or secondary school according to
UNESCO’s Institute for Statistics (UIS). In the
region’s rural areas, two out of every five
children fail to finish primary school or are at
least two years behind when they finally do so.
This compares to one urban child in six.
The Institute’s report on Latin America and
the Caribbean1 examines the state of education
around the world. It presents figures for 19
countries gathered over the 1998 - 1999 school
year from national and other sources including
the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and covers access
and participation of pupils and students from
early childhood to tertiary level in both public
and private education, teaching staff and
education expenditure. 
The report shows that although overall school
enrolment is improving in the region, countries
there are still a long way from ensuring that
their children succeed at school.
“Getting kids into school is one thing.
Keeping them there, and ensuring that they
learn something is another,” says Ken Ross, a
senior researcher at UNESCO’s International
Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP). 
In all of the countries surveyed at least 80
percent of primary school-age children are
enrolled in primary education. However, the
report finds that only 54 percent of secondary
school-age youth are enrolled, leaving an
estimated 20 million “out-of-school” or still in
primary classes.
High drop out and repetition rates are the
norm in several countries. In Brazil, for
example, 24 percent of primary-school pupils
and 18 percent of secondary students are
repeaters. For every 100 children who enter
primary school in Nicaragua, only 55 reach
grade 5. Argentina has the highest “survival
rate”, with 94 percent of pupils reaching
grade 5.
Tertiary education is one of the region’s
“greatest educational challenges”, according
to the report. Despite increased enrolment
throughout the 90s, only 9.5 million people were
enrolled in tertiary education in Latin America
in 1998, with Brazil, Mexico and Argentina
alone accounting for almost 60 percent
of the total. 
Overall, the report states, Latin American
children spend less than nine years at school,
which is only one a half years more than
20 years ago. It is also well below the 12 years
judged by the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean as being “the
minimum amount of education necessary to earn
a wage that will make it possible to rise above
poverty in the course of a person’s active life.” 
The report doesn’t give any detailed
explanation of why kids are not making through
primary and secondary school in the region, but
highlights difficulties in implementing
institutional reforms and a continued
vulnerability to external events which has left
In Africa, the
question of quality is

Latin America’s economic performance fairly
weak.
The good news is that that despite the
varying levels of development across the region,
countries are committed to the modernization
and reform of their education systems. It also
notes that a real opportunity to improve is
emerging as population growth slows. Across
the region the population is increasing by
approximately 1.5 percent annually. This
means, says the report, that there will be a
smaller number of children to educate without
necessarily increasing education budgets.
AFRICA: AN UPHILL BATTLE
In Africa , the question of quality is still
intrinsically linked to access. According to the
UIS, four out of every ten primary–age children
in sub-Saharan Africa do not go to school, and
of those who do, only a small proportion reach
a basic level of skills. 
The Institute’s recent report, Education
Statistics 2001 – Regional Report on sub-Saharan
Africa, examines education in 49 countries and,
as with the Latin American report, covers the
1998 and 1999 school years. 
Data were provided by national authorities
responding to the annual education
questionnaire from the Institute, and
supplemented by figures from other
international bodies including the United
Nations Statistics and Population Divisions, and
the World Bank. 
It finds that pre-primary education is
extremely limited in the region, involving only
one child in ten, or some four million children.
The situation varies greatly from one country to
another, with Eastern and Southern Africa
accounting for 62 percent of these children. The
pre-primary institutions are largely private,
catering for more than eight children out of
every ten enrolled.  
Primary education is clearly the priority for
most of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
Yet, according to the report, only 60 percent of
primary-age children were actually enrolled
throughout the region in the survey years, but
that average hides big differences between
countries. In Niger, for example, only 26 percent
of primary-age children were in school,
School hours rarely take into 
account the need for extra hands 
at harvest time
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)
was established in 1999 to improve UNESCO’s
statistical programme and to develop and deliver the
timely, accurate and policy-relevant statistics 
needed in today’s increasingly complex and rapidly
changing environment.
The statistical information gathered by the UIS 
not only helps interpret and report on global
developments in education, science, culture and
communication, it also helps countries to formulate,
implement and monitor policies and programmes 
in areas such as education and poverty reduction.
UIS is located on the campus of the University 
of Montreal in Montreal, Canada.

outnumbering boys in secondary schools in
Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia.
All of the countries in the region, except St
Helena, Sao Tome and Principe and the
Seychelles, have at least one university.
However, tertiary education remains “marginal”
with only about one and a half million students
enrolled in these institutions (these figures
exclude Nigeria). The report signals that many
students – particularly those in advanced
research – have to study abroad because
programmes are not available in their home
countries. Within the region, a majority of
tertiary students choose to study education and
social sciences (including humanities).
“MARGINAL”
Overall, there is an average of 40 pupils per
teacher across the region, but again the
situation varies considerably from country to
country. In St Helena, the ratio is nine pupils
for every teacher, but in Mozambique, Uganda,
Chad, Mali and Congo it is more than 60 to one.
“It should be stressed,” says the report, “that
national mean figures of 60 pupils or more per
teacher in fact mean these countries may have
some teachers in charge of 100 pupils of more.”
compared to 93 percent in Mauritius.
Based on these figures, the report estimates
that some 38-million primary-age children were
out-of-school in sub-Saharan Africa in 1998,
about 60 percent of them in the countries of
Central and Western Africa.
The data also indicates a “relatively high”
level of repetition in the region, with an average
of 17 percent of pupils repeating a year. 
Secondary education, says the report, “is still
not widespread in sub-Saharan Africa,” and
complete data are not available for all countries
in the region. Late entry and high repetition
rates also mean that, in many countries, the
majority of secondary-age children are still
attending primary classes. In the 21 countries for
which data were available, an average of only 19
percent of young people of secondary-school-age
were enrolled at that level. In five countries
(Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mozambique and
Niger) it was less than ten percent. 
Many more boys than girls are enrolled in
secondary schools across the region. In
countries such as Benin, Chad, Guinea-Bissau
and Togo, more than twice as many boys as
girls attend secondary classes. There are
however exceptions to this pattern with girls

Teachers throughout the region are generally
poorly trained with considerable variation
between countries. For the 16 countries, which
provided figures on pre-primary education, an
average of only 30 percent of teachers received
any training. The situation is somewhat better
in primary education, but again extremely
variable. Equatorial Guinea claims that 100
percent of primary teachers there have received
some training. In Guinea Bissau only 28 percent
have. In half of the 26 countries for which data
were available, 20 percent of primary teachers
had not received any training at all. 
Total spending on education ranges from one
percent of GDP in Sierra Leone to over ten
percent in Zimbabwe (10.1) and Lesotho (13.2).
Most of the money goes towards current
expenditure, including teachers’ salaries and the
purchase of materials, and the lion’s share is
devoted to primary education.
The educational challenges facing the
countries of sub-Saharan Africa are
considerable. Poverty, HIV-AIDS (see box), war
and civil conflicts and high population growth
are major hurdles for all governments and
populations throughout the region. One person
in three is of primary or secondary school age
compared to only one in five in Latin America
and Asia and one in six in OECD countries. “A
sustained and substantial increase in GDP
growth rates would seem to be an important
precondition for improving access to
education,” concludes the report.
To make a difference, the report suggests that
governments need to recognize the crucial role
of education in development; enhance the
capacities of institutions and education
personnel; and extend access and increase
equity while improving the quality and
relevance of education.
COMMITMENTS
Most of the world’s governments, development
agencies and donor organizations now accept
that education is a key factor in determining a
person’s quality of life, as well as productivity,
employability and national development . At the
World Education Forum held in Dakar, Senegal,
two years ago, 164 countries committed
themselves to achieving quality basic education
for all by 2015 or earlier. For their part, donor
countries pledged “no country seriously
committed to basic education will be thwarted
in the achievement of this goal by lack of
resources”.
Two years down the track, many countries are
obviously struggling. According to a monitoring
report released late last year on Education For
All, at least 32 nations may not even be able to
meet the basic goal of enrolling all children in
primary schools by 2015, let alone make sure
that they at least get a minimum and
meaningful education. 
Sue Williams
Getting a clear picture
In 1995, UNESCO’s International Institute for Educational
Planning (IIEP) and the education ministries of southern
African countries launched a major project to monitor
education quality in the region with a view to improving it.
The  first phase of the Southern Africa Consortium for
Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) project focused on
assessing the conditions of schooling - looking at the
infrastructure, numbers of teachers and availability of
teaching materials for example. SACMAQ II includes an
assessment of the performance levels of students and their
teachers in literacy and mathematics. Some 50,000 students,
5,000 teachers and 2,500 school principals from primary
schools across 15 southern African countries were involved in
data collection for the project. Results are expected out late
this year or early in 2003. 
… and those who make it into class 
often have to share a teacher with more
than 60 other classmates

Cheick Modibo Diarra,
head of the African
Virtual University
School goes to
the children
education
Cheick Modibo
Diarra, the NASA
interplanetary
navigator and
UNESCO Goodwill
Ambassador, was
appointed head of
the African Virtual
University on
March 8. The new
higher education
institute, based in
Nairobi, will link
existing African
universities and top
colleges around the
world, whose
courses will be
transmitted live by
satellite onto huge
screens in stadiums
in Africa. Tens of
thousands of
students will thus be
able to get quality
education without
having to travel.
In Cambodia, more than 3,000
poor and marginalized youth,
working and street children and
those living in remote areas
with no access to school will be
the main beneficiaries of a
three-year non-formal education
programme, coordinated by
UNESCO’s Phnom Penh office.
The project will include
literacy and numeracy, problem
solving, appropriate skill
training, health, recreational and
cultural activities, small
business management and
reintegration wherever possible
into the formal education
system.
The programme is being
implemented in cooperation
with the Cambodian Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sports and
five local NGOs. Japan has
agreed to fund the project to the
tune of  $610,000.
Draw me 
Peace
June 30 is the closing date
for entries to UNESCO’s
“Draw me Peace”
competition. It’s open to
classes of children from four
to seven years old, who’re
invited to invent – with their
teacher’s help – a story in
pictures, illustrating one or
several of six themes:
respect for all life, non-
violence, sharing, listening
to understand, preserving
the planet, tolerance and
solidarity.
Two winners per age
group (4-5 and 6-7 year
olds) will be chosen in
September. 
The competition is
organized in the framework
of the International Decade
for a Culture of Peace and
Non-Violence for the
Children of the World (2001-
2010). Details and
registration forms are
available on the internet at

violence in
Brazil
More than half of those
students who know where
- and from whom - arms
can be bought (55 percent)
say that getting hold of a
weapon is easy. Seventy
percent of those students
who have, or have had a
firearm, say that they are
used in schools, and more
than half of these young
people say that their
parents and those close
to them also own weapons.
These figures, and others
on gangs and drug
trafficking in or near
schools, come from a new
book, “Violencias nas
Escolas” (Violence in
schools), which looks at
school violence in 14 major
Brazilian cities.
Launched in March
by UNESCO’s regional
office in Brazil
(uhbrz@unesco.org.br)
the book presents the
results of the biggest study
of its kind ever carried out
in Latin America. More
than 50,000 questionnaires
were distributed
to students, parents
and teachers and more
than 2,000 people were
interviewed. 
The study found that
school violence badly
affects the school
environment, leads to an
increase in absenteeism
and a drop in the quality
of education.

UNESCO backs
Afghanistan’s independent media
Music, films, kite-flying and football have
returned to Kabul.  The independent media is
back too. Kabul Weekly reappeared on January
24 (five years after it had closed), the women’s
magazine Malalai was launched on February
21 and the satirical monthly Zambel e Gham in
mid-January. 
The help of UNESCO and the French
association Aïna was crucial to the media
revival of Kabul Weekly. UNESCO came up
with US $12,000 to fund Kabul Weekly’s first
few issues and has raised another US $25,000
from the US government.  It will continue to
seek further aid from the international
community.
The five journalists who produce Malalai
and the staff of Zambel e Gham work at the
Press Centre, a UNESCO-Aïna project to give
logistical support and professional training to
the Afghan media.  The Centre provides access
to the local and regional press, satellite and
cable television and news agency wires, and
also has a library, an internet connection, an
electronic directory and a number of
computers.  The Centre will offer training for
journalists and a website for the Afghan
media.
This “project nursery,” whose buildings
have been restored with the help of US
$133,000 from DFID (the British government
aid body), USAID and Reporters Without
Borders, is expected to lead to other media
projects being started.

Geoffrey Nyarota of Zimbabwe awarded
World Press Freedom Prize 2002
Zimbabwean journalist
Geoffrey Nyarota, founder
and editor-in-chief of
Zimbabwe’s only independent
daily newspaper, the Daily
News, was awarded the
UNESCO/Guillermo Cano
World Press Freedom Prize
for 2002 on World Press
Freedom Day, May 3, in
Manila (Philippines).
Mr Nyarota, 50, has been
tireless in denouncing
corruption and criminal
activities among top
government officials in his
country despite intense
harassment by the
authorities.
The US $25,000 prize was
awarded by UNESCO
Director-General
Koïchiro Matsuura on the
recommendation of an
international, independent
jury of journalists.
Mr Matsuura praised
Mr Nyarota’s “courage and
persistence” as “an example
to all the world’s journalists.”
Mr Nyarota has paid
heavily for his professional
commitment. Already in
1983, he lost his job at the
The Chronicle in Bulawayo
because he broke the story on
the “Willowgate” scandal that
forced the resignation of five
cabinet ministers. In 1991, he
was dismissed from his post
as editor of the weekly
Financial Gazette in a dispute
over editorial control. The
biggest battle waged by Mr
Nyarota’s own Daily News
has been over its coverage of
the invasion of white-owned
farms by war veterans
encouraged by Zimbabwe’s
ruling ZANU-PF party. The
paper’s reports, including
stories about the use of police
vehicles in the pillages, has
led to death threats against
Mr Nyarota, to his arrest and
to the bombing of the Daily
News offices.

freedom 
in the
Palestinian
Territories
As escalating violence in the
Middle East took its toll on
journalists covering
Palestinian territories under
Israeli military attack,
UNESCO’s Director-General,
Koïchiro Matsuura,
condemned increasing
restrictions on press freedom.
He urged “Israel, as a
signatory of the International
Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights,” to respect its
Article 19 which enshrines
the “right to freedom of
expression” and states that
“this right shall include
freedom to seek, receive and
impart information and ideas
of all kinds.” Mr Matsuura
deplored the constraints on
journalists covering events in
the region and condemned
Israeli measures against the
Voice of Palestine, the radio
station of the Palestinian
National Authority, and the
Authority’s television
broadcaster.

Clean water for the Afghans
Cities across Central
Asia are threatened by a
battery of water-related
problems—from violent
flooding to severe
drought and disease
resulting from
insufficient treatment
facilities. To improve the
situation, UNESCO and
the Islamic Republic of
Iran will set up the first
Regional Centre on
Urban Water
Management, to be
based in Tehran. 
The centre should be
operational by mid-year,
with a key priority to
train technicians from
Afghanistan to
rehabilitate what
remains of Kabul’s
water infrastructure and
that of other major
cities. In addition to
training professionals,
the centre will also
serve as a clearinghouse
for scientific data,
international assistance
activities and other
resources required to
better manage urban
water problems. 
Regional water
managers are
particularly interested in
developing “ecological
sanitation,” in which
traditional technologies
are updated and
adapted to reduce the
amount of treated water
used to wash away
sewage, which has been
the standard yet
expensive approach
taken in most Western
cities. 
In Caribbean islands,
the coastline plays
an important role in
the economy, from
tourism to fishing.
But poorly-planned
construction, sand
mining and even sea
defences, can disturb
fragile beach
ecosystems, accelerating
erosion and worsening
the impact of natural
disasters. When
Hurricane Luis struck
Anguilla in 1995, much
of the beach was lost
at Mead’s Bay on
the island’s north coast.
But local people can
help to slow down
the rate of erosion
and offset some of
the damage done
to property. In some
cases, it is simply
a matter of building
a house, hotel or
business a certain
minimum distance from
the beach. 
For the past year
UNESCO has been
teaming up with local
planning experts in nine
Caribbean Islands
to publish a series of
short, but highly
informative booklets
on “Wise practices
for coping with beach
erosion”. The first
of these, published with
Anguilla’s Department
of Physical Planning,
is filled with practical
information. Other
booklets are being
published this year for
Grenada, St Kitts, Nevis,
Antigua Barbuda,
Dominica, Monserrat,
St Vincent (Bequia), and
Turks & Caicos Islands.

An AIDS prevention
centre for Cameroon
Dr. Luc Montagnier, one
of the French biologists
who discovered HIV, is
working with UNESCO
to create and oversee
an AIDS research and
prevention centre
in Cameroon, where
the infection rate has
reached 12 percent of
the national population.
The centre will have
branches in two hospitals,
in the capital, Yaoundé,
and Douala. Staff will
focus on bioclinical
research, teacher training
activities for AIDS
prevention as well
as counselling and
treatment on an out-
patient basis for people
with HIV. 
The centre is part of
the World Foundation
for Aids Research
and Prevention, created
in 1993, by UNESCO
and Dr. Montagnier. A key
aim is to bridge the gap
in terms of research and
treatment options between
rich and poor nations.
Various UN agencies are
involved in the foundation,
which operates a similar
research centre
in Côte-d’Ivoire.

Kabul gets
its museum back
culture
The rehabilitation of
Afghanistan’s
national museum in
Kabul got under
way on March 1
with the signing of
a memorandum of
understanding
between UNESCO
and the Afghan
government.
The museum has
no roof or windows
at the moment, says
Jim Williams of
UNESCO in Kabul.
Most of the exhibits
are in storage
on the ground floor
or in the basement
and its curator,
Omar Khan Masudi,
says a third of
them have survived.
Several boxes of
items, including
a number of
Buddha heads
and small statues,
are being looked
after by the culture
ministry.
All these items
were rescued by the
museum staff who
managed to hide
them from the
destructive fury of
the Taleban who,
between February
and June 2001,
attacked any
depiction of living
things with
hammers and axes.

The life and death
of languages
Over the past three
centuries, languages
have died out or
disappeared in
alarming numbers,
especially in
America and
Australia. Today at
least 3,000
languages – half of
the world’s total –
are in danger.
UNESCO stirred
worldwide debate
with the launch of
the second edition
of its Atlas of the
World’s Languages
in Danger of
Disappearing, on
International
Mother Language
Day on February 21.
The media in many
countries have
reported on often
impassioned
reactions to the
death of local
languages,
frequently squeezed
out by English,
French, Chinese or
Russian. But
experience shows
that all is not lost.
Linguistic diversity
can be preserved
through determined
policy and by
encouraging
multilingualism,
which is strongly
backed by UNESCO.

Democracy and its

Lebanon, South Africa
and the Democratic

the first three countries
to be studied by the new
International Centre
of Human Sciences
in Byblos, in Lebanon.
The Centre, officially
opened on March 1, will
focus on the cultures of
different countries and
their links with
democracy. Its director,
Theodor Hanf, says there
is a need to “know how
people perceive
their cultures and
how they want to be
governed, since their true
wishes are not honestly
reflected by politicians.”
The project, which is
funded half and half by
UNESCO and the
Lebanese government
($200,000 each), began in
1973 but was delayed
because of the 1975-90
civil war in Lebanon.
To mark Africa Day on
May 25, the African Group
– uniting all of the
continent’s ambassadors
to UNESCO – has
organized a colloquium
at headquarters on
the theme of “negritude”.
Debate topics are:
The Injustice Done
to Africa; The Refusal
and Negation on these
Injustices; A Dialogue

At a time of globalization and the
acceleration and multiplication of exchanges,
the future appears, if not obscure, at least
opaque. Complexity and uncertainty are the
defining words of our era. Caught up in 
the frenzy of the immediate, victims of the
tyranny of urgent tasks, we do not take the
time to develop well-constructed actions
or to reflect on their consequences. We have
embarked, without brakes and without
visibility, on the adventure of the future.
But the fastest automobiles need the most
powerful headlights. It is therefore no longer
a matter of adjusting and adapting since
adjustment and adaptation are always
trailing the times. We must take the initiative.
We must look into the future, adopt
a forward-looking vision of the world:
tomorrow our children will harvest the fruits
of our foresight, or of our blindness.

investment in education? How can we
ensure that globalization becomes a
powerful force for emancipation and
international solidarity, instead of one
that generates exclusion and inward-
looking attitudes?
It is true that globalization offers
the potential benefit of improved
means of information and
communication, as well as the
transport of this information. The
new information and communication
technologies provide fresh
opportunities in the area of distance
learning; they hint at the promise of a
society of networks – one which is
decentralized, more democratic and
less hierarchical. Globalization could
contribute not just to the
fragmentation of societies but also to
the spread of an international
consciousness. This is perhaps how
we should see the ill-named anti-
globalisation protest movement that
sociologist Edgar Morin calls a
second globalisation: one of
awareness, alongside economic and
technical globalisation.

codes today, followed by genetic
codes tomorrow – the third industrial
revolution is subjecting the material
production society to a new –
immaterial – force, which is based on
the signs of the “programmed
society.” The advent of this society is
being precipitated by the rapid
growth of world networks, both
public and private, which are the
main instruments of globalization,
the pace of which they help to
accelerate. The effects of this
revolution – which subjects societies
to a fractal logic – have now
penetrated the very fabric of our
society. What effect will this trend

increasing?
The past few decades have seen
considerable progress. The
UNDP says poverty has decreased more
in the last 50 years than in the last five
centuries. However, over three billion
individuals – more tha half the human
race – are trying to survive, living in
poverty on less than US $2 a day; 1.5
billion individuals have no drinking
water and over 2 billion do not get
basic health care. Seventy per- cent of
poor people are women, and two thirds
of poor people are under 15.
According to the World Bank, on
the basis of current projections the
number of people living in absolute
poverty (or on US $1 a day) looks set
to rise. By 2015, 1.9 billion people
could be living below the absolute
poverty threshold, compared to 1.5
billion people at the dawn of the new
millennium and 1.2 billion in 1987.
In 25 years time, at least 85 percent
of the total world population will
probably live in developing or
transitional economies, which will
have to bear the brunt of this
demographic growth – unless there
are new waves of South-North
migration. And the concentration of
resources in the hands of a few could
continue, or even intensify, which

would make the situation worse. In
addition, the rise in poverty can be
measured not only in economic terms
but also in terms of education,
technology, culture, environment and
health.
Some 800 million people in the
developing world suffer from chronic
malnutrition. The current decrease
(an average of eight million people a
year) is insufficient to fulfil the
pledge taken at the World Food
Summit in November 1996 by 186
countries: to cut by half the number
of people suffering from malnutrition
by 2015. This objective could only be
met if this figure decreased by 20
million people a year.

The events of September 11
and their consequences
seem to have created a new pattern
of international security, of war and
peace, in which an alliance of
“civilised” states faces countries
supporting international terrorism. Of
course this picture should be
qualified, if only to avoid spreading
the dangerous (and largely refuted)
myth of “a clash of civilisations.”
Despite the genuine risks of
international terrorism and the
tensions and imbalances it creates,
we must remember that this new
situation has not abolished the risks
there were before: it has simply
superimposed itself on them.
Since the end of the Cold War,
peace appears to be less impossible,

while war often seems to be that
much less improbable. A number of
states continue to devote considerable
sums to defence, which are then not
available when it comes to dealing
with the non-military threats to their
future. In addition, we have seen a
rise in the number of intra-State
confrontations and inter-ethnic or
inter-communal conflicts, which now
represent the type of conflict par
excellence at the dawn of the 21st
century. Such conflicts often take
place against a background of the
breakdown of the rule of law and of
the powerlessness of national
institutions. In such circumstances,
are we to fear the growth, in the
coming decades, of the phenomenon
of “failed states” and an increasing
number of conflicts that take place
without any respect whatsoever for
international legal norms, making any
attempt at mediation on the part of
international institutions extremely
difficult?
Intolerance, xenophobia, racism
and discrimination are resurfacing,
sometimes in violent and even
genocidal fashion; their practitioners
justify them on the grounds of
religious, national, cultural and
linguistic affiliation. Are we going to

massacres and enormous human
rights violations, the growth of illegal
war economies and more violence in
schools and society? Will states and
international institutions in the
coming decades be reduced to
managing differences rather than
strengthening the social link?
The end of the Cold War aroused
great hopes: at long last, it would be
possible to substantially reduce
defence budgets and invest more in
human development, in particular
education. However, it has to be said
that the famous “peace dividends”
have yet to arrive. After the hopes of
a “disarmament race” which began in
1989 after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
we are now seeing new increases in
military spending and new growth in
the arms trade.
The threats to peace and security
are no longer solely of a military
nature. In recent decades there has
been an increase in awareness, at
both the national and international
level, of the many different
dimensions of peace and security. In
view of the increasing
interdependence of political,
economic, financial, social and
environmental phenomena, will the
United Nations Security Council not
feel impelled to include on a more
systematic basis, among its fields of
competence, other threats which
endanger human security: the
degradation of the environment and
living conditions; population
problems; cultural and ethnic
rivalries; and all forms of violations
of human rights?

The United Nations projects
that the world’s
population could reach eight billion
in 2028 and nine billion in 2054,
when it will then stabilize at about
that figure. Thus, there would not be
any demographic bomb, but a strong
increase followed by a levelling off;
according to some demographers
there could even be, in a few
decades’ time, an implosion: the low
projections by the United Nations
predict that world population will
reach a ceiling around 2050 of about
7.3 billion, and then begin to fall.
Since the demographic transition has
accelerated, it can therefore no longer
be excluded that the world’s
population will scarcely exceed
8 billion people by about 2050.
Demographic
changes
Moreover, the world’s population 
is ageing: the under 15s would go
from 31 percent to 19 percent of the
world’s population from 1995 to
2050, according to the United
Nations’ intermediate scenario, and
the over 60s would increase
proportionately during the same
period from 10 percent 
to 22 percent.
The geographical distribution of the
world’s population is also changing.
In the absence of strong migratory
flows that cannot be ruled out, the
populations of Europe and Japan
should decline over the next 50 years.
According to some analyses, there
would be no other solution than
immigration to offset the drastic
decrease in the balance between the
working and non-working
populations.
The causes of mortality are also
changing. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has warned of
an impending global crisis concerning
infectious diseases. Despite
considerable progress (smallpox has
been eradicated and polio and guinea
worm may also be), a third of deaths
worldwide are still attributable to
infectious diseases caused by bacteria
and viruses: some are new, others are
in constant mutation, while others
still have adapted to resist the

worrying tendency to travel. One
disease departs and another arrives:
in 1980, WHO announced the
worldwide eradication of smallpox; in
the following year, 1981, AIDS was
identified for the first time.
Meanwhile, major diseases like
tuberculosis are re-emerging, new
agents of infection such as the prion
have been identified, several known
diseases have developed resistance to
the traditional antibiotics, and
vaccine research is on the decline. In
Botswana, the country most affected
by the AIDS epidemic, a quarter of
the adult population is infected by
the AIDS virus. Life expectancy at
birth has fallen from 61 years to 47
years over the last decade, while,
without the AIDS epidemic, it would
now be 67 years. Life expectancy has
also fallen in the Russian Federation
and in several countries of the former
USSR.

natural and cultural resources; the
right to housing; new problems of
urban citizenship and the contraction
of public space). If these trends are
confirmed, it has been estimated that
the equivalent of a thousand cities of
3 million inhabitants would have to
be built over the next 40 years –
almost as many cities as exist today.
Urban expansion is now strongest
in the poorest regions – where it is
unaccompanied by real development
– but also in those regions which 
are experiencing the most rapid
economic growth. In the latter case, 
a “boom” often produces a chaotic
explosion which gives rise to
considerable problems relating to the
provision of drinking water, energy
and food security, and to violence,
marginalization and exclusion.
Consequently, many countries have
experienced a growth of “gated
communities” surrounded by walls,
protected by barriers or isolated 
by distance. In the United States,
between four million and eight
million people, according to some
assessments, live like this in 
very highly protected residential
areas. According to an OECD report
published in 1996, 35 million
Americans live in 150,000
communities managed by private
associations.
Attracted by the bright lights of the
city, millions of people leave the
poverty of rural areas to go and live
in the wretched “accompanied
loneliness” of large cities, where they
often find themselves lacking 
the most elementary amenities, 
such as schools, sanitation or basic
infrastructure, in a situation of
poverty and exclusion that often
provides fertile ground for violence
and extremism. In such situations,
how are cities to be humanized? 
How are habits of urban behaviour
and civility to be re-created? How are
the excluded to be assimilated?

We now know that failing
widespread measures, the
impact of human activity on the
global environment threatens the
survival of the biosphere and future
generations:
Global climatic warming largely
results, according to the vast majority
of scientists, from “greenhouse gas”
emissions caused by human activity
and modern modes of consumption,
primarily those which are bound up
with urbanization (thermal power
plants, industrial pollution, motor
traffic, etc.). The thawing of the
Earth’s glaciers would lead to a
veritable ecological disaster. Global
warming also seems to be
accompanied by greater variability
and considerable regional or local
disturbances. These could be the
cause of radical climatic changes in
some regions of the world and of a
growing number of increasingly
serious “natural” disasters whose
precursory signs are already to be
observed. It is nevertheless clear that,
where control of greenhouse gas
emissions is concerned, the progress
made since the Rio Conference in
1992 has had a limited impact, as
shown by the problems of getting the
Kyoto Protocol ratified. 
Water is not evenly distributed: it is
abundant, it is “running”, but not

everywhere and for everyone. Almost
a quarter of humanity – 1.4 billion
people – does not have access to
clean and drinking water and over
half the world’s population lacks
proper sanitation. To meet the
challenges will require above all
policies on the judicious use of water
resources so as to put an end to the
excessive consumption of water in
agriculture, which at present uses up
worldwide close to two thirds of all
the water taken from rivers, lakes,
streams and underground. But
behaviour patterns must also change.
The depletion of the ozone layer,
protector of life on Earth, has never
been so great. But there are
encouraging signs: if the provisions of
international protocols are complied
with, the ozone layer could be
completely reconstituted by 2050.
Desertification is spreading and
today directly affects 250 million
people and is threatening close to one
billion human beings living on arid
lands in approximately 110 countries.
This figure could double by 2050 if
desert areas continue to expand at
the present rate.

directly affected. While forests still

thousands of new chemical products
have appeared. These chemicals are
present in countless consumer and
maintenance products throughout the
world, in cardboard and plastic
packaging, in the waters of all the
oceans and in the air, and in houses,
schools and work-places. They pass
through the food chain and cross the
barriers of the species. Some
pesticides and dangerous chemicals
that have been prohibited or strictly
controlled in some countries can be
exported to poor countries, where
they give rise to frequent cases of
poisoning.
Biodiversity is also likely to

Most of all, participation in the
“civilization of the immaterial” is
extremely patchy in different parts of
the world. How can we fight against
“techno-apartheid” when, as we
know, the new technologies are one
of the keys to the 21st century, to
accessing information and setting up

the transmission of knowledge,
democracy and pluralism. But the
ongoing revolution also raises some
essential questions about the
consequences of this form of
“globalization.” Apart from the
industrial innovation that the new
information and communication
technologies introduce, societal
options can be discerned. How can
we help “maintain, increase and
diffuse knowledge,” as UNESCO’s
Charter requires, in this radically new
context? Some are already speaking
indiscriminately of the “information
society” and the “knowledge society”.
Should we not stop confusing
“information” and “knowledge”? The
oversupply of information may be
condemning knowledge – which
involves mastery of information
through knowledge and critical
reflection. In short, education.

f o c u scountry, however powerful, can solve
them by itself.
To meet all these challenges for the
future, which are complex, global and
interlinked, there is no task quite so
difficult or so pressing as learning to
live together. Faced with an
increasingly globalized market, are
we moving towards more developed
forms of international and regional
democracy?
New actors have emerged on the
international scene who are changing
the practice of democracy,
participation, association, and even
the rules of the game in international
cooperation. Granted, the 21st
century will most likely not see the
disappearance of the world order
based on the state; but within states
and at the international level, the
power of civil society seems set to
grow. Will a new culture of
democracy strengthen the links
between representative and
participatory democracy? The 21st
century must therefore provide an
answer to this crucial question: how
can we humanize globalization in
light of these new challenges and
threats?
7
Will the “globalization” of
most of the challenges
that we have mentioned make it a
matter of increasing urgency to
strengthen systems of international
and regional governance? According
to Boutros Boutros-Ghali, “the only
institution that exists, and which has
the means for solving such global
problems, is the United Nations.” 
In a world which is interdependent
and increasingly aware of its common
destiny, the solution of problems
requires coordinated action at the
global level, whether it concerns
environment or public health, the
fight against corruption or organized
crime. These and many other issues
transcend national borders. No

UNESCO’s fields of competence. In
view of these advances, the role of
women should grow during the first
decades of the 21st century and most
societies should move towards greater
gender equality.
The most remarkable advances are
those that have been made in
education. Significant progress has
also been achieved with regard to
health: the life expectancy of women
has risen at a rate 20 percent higher
than that of men during the past 20
years; their average fertility rate has
fallen by one third. Very slowly, the
gateways to political power are
opening up to women, at least in
some countries. Despite popular
belief, this progress has been even
more appreciable in the South.
However, the progress achieved over
the past 30 years in the fields of
education, health and participation has
far from eliminated all the obstacles.
With regard to education, nearly two
thirds of the 880 million illiterates in
the world are women, and one adult
woman in three today cannot read or
write; most of them live in rural areas.
Despite their specific health and
nutrition needs, women, particularly in
the Third World, receive poorer care
than men. In politics and in the
professions, in spite of recent progress,
Of all the inequalities linked
to development, gender
inequality is one of the most specific,
cutting across all countries, even
those that are most advanced and
proudest of their achievements in this
regard. Contrary to received wisdom,
progress in gender equality is not
always related to the wealth of a
country, or even – at first sight more
surprisingly – to the level of what
UNDP calls “human development.” It
is more a question of how
development is viewed, of political
will, cultural change, and the
commitment of society at large.
It is true that substantial progress
has been achieved at global level in
recent decades, particularly within

Poverty affects women
disproportionately. Of all those living
in absolute poverty, 70 percent are
women, and the number of women
living in poverty in rural areas has
practically doubled in 20 years. With
regard to work, improved training for
women has not yet translated into
higher income, effective equal rights
and social recognition. In other words,
the vast majority of women remain
confined to what some economists call
the “pink ghetto”: service staff,
subsistence agriculture and poorly
paid office jobs. In addition, in all
regions of the world, unemployment
and underemployment affect women
more than men. Women still do not
receive equal treatment with men
when it comes to property and
inheritance rights or rights relating to
marriage and divorce.

It is probable that the rise of
the new information and
communication technologies,
information networking, and growing
interactivity and interconnectivity will
substantially and permanently alter
not only the economic, social and
political landscape, but also the
cultural landscape in the coming
decades.
The key question is whether
globalization and the new technologies
will promote the rise of cultural
pluralism, dialogue and cross-cultural
encounters. If so, what will be the
nature of those encounters? Will they
be rewarding and creative, or will they
be hostile and destructive? Are we
heading for a “clash of civilizations” or

world? Let us not forget that at least
half (or perhaps a lot more) of the
5,000 to 6,700 languages spoken in the
world today may die out by the end 
of this century.
Will cultural identities, over the
coming decades, replace citizenship or
help to reinforce and reinvent it?
According to French sociologist Alain
Touraine, “the central question to
which political thought and action
must respond” is “how to restore a link
between the excessively open space 
of the economy and the extremely
closed and fragmented world of
cultures?” Another question then
arises: what type of identities and what
sorts of authorities will be fostered by
the information society and the
information networks?
The technologization of culture is
another observable trend. The
application to culture of industrial
techniques, while helping to
disseminate culture, may also presage
the disappearance of traditional ways
of producing and transmitting it. Will

the new facilities for duplicating,
disseminating, recomposing and
manipulating images and sounds speed
the rise of a society of pretence and a
fully virtual era? What will intellectual
property mean in the new context?
What will the future of copyright be? 
The 21st century will have to meet
another challenge: how to ensure the
access of all to culture, and to all
cultures. How can we foster genuine
dialogue between cultures? In what
direction is the digital world moving:
will networks be opening up or
becoming more exclusive? In this
context, one of the major issues of the
coming decades will surely be
development of information in the
public domain and providing equal
access to it, in particular in developing
countries.
What effect will the new
technologies have on books and
reading? The increasing digitization of
written texts and the development of
new aids are already giving rise to new
forms of writing and reading but also
of printing and circulating material;
books are becoming a form of raw
material that can be manipulated
endlessly. With interactivity, readers
now have an almost infinite number of
choices with regard to texts and, as a
result, reading could become genuinely
plural and pluralist.
What is more, the new technologies
will be bringing about marked changes
in the creation and communication of
knowledge. In the 21st century,
textbooks and educational texts in
general might be designed with a view
to greater interactivity between the
various fields of knowledge in order to
meet the individual needs and tastes of
every learner. They would thus
encourage self-instruction and self-
learning and a new way of reading
akin to navigation.
Another major trend is the
development of the notion of heritage,
which has broadened over the last few
decades from preservation of the
cultural and natural to recognition of
intangible, symbolic and spiritual
heritage and then to protection of the
human genome. What will the new
terrain of heritage be like in coming
decades?

Science and technology:
the new ethical
challenges
The many advances in
biotechnology, genetics,
astrophysics and the sciences of the
infinitely large and the infinitely
small are revolutionizing our
perception of living things and the
world around us.
In many cases these scientific and
technological advances hold the
promise of positive applications for
the benefit of humankind. This is
true of progress in genetic
engineering, which is paving the way
for new gene therapies. It also applies
to the development of energy-efficient
techniques and the field of
nanotechnology, which concerns
medicine and computer technology.
Use of biotechnology in agriculture
could, if properly controlled, help
combat food shortages.
But these advances also raise
questions and ethical concerns. To
begin with, there is the application of
technology to living organisms,
especially human beings. Will the
power to artificialize nature and
manipulate species – even the human
species – take us into the “brave new
world” foreseen by Aldous Huxley
and an ethically unacceptable
situation in which humans
domesticate other humans? What
status will human beings have when
they are the object of manipulation,

experimentation, mutilation or even
destruction? What, in this new
context, will be the meaning of life
and death? Who will decide on the
supposed “usefulness” of a particular
genetic feature? Parallel manipulation
of the genetic heritage of plant and
animal species will in future decades
surely be an unprecedented challenge
for the global environment.
Over and above society and the
environment, the very definition of
the human species and its biological
integrity is at stake and in danger.
Human beings can now alter the
genetic heritage of any species,
including their own. They even have
the dismal privilege of being able to
plan their own destruction. What
must be done now is to agree to
limit, through ethical guidelines and
wisdom, the currently boundless
power of technology. We must apply
to technology Montesquieu’s maxim
that absolute power corrupts
absolutely. We must apply to science
Rabelais’ observation that science
without conscience is but the ruin of
the soul.

AVEDA & UNESCO/UNEP/RARE
For the fourth year running,
several tourist firms have renewed
their support for UNESCO’s
Memories of the Future project.
The companies – including tour
operators EF (United States), Tui-
Gruppe (Germany) and Nouvelle
Frontières (France) and hotel
groups Accor (France) and SAS
(Belgium) – pledged at the
International Tourism Fair (the
world’s biggest) in Berlin on 16
March to continue their
commercial and advertising efforts
to popularise cultural and natural
World Heritage.  One the main
features of this project in the
current International Year of
Cultural Heritage is to persuade
tourists it is every individual’s
duty to protect heritage sites.
The Memories of the Future
programme has funded some of
the restoration work on Prince
Gong’s palace in Beijing, the
medina in Tunis and the old city
centre in Krakow, Poland
Conservation and tourism
in World Heritage Sites
The goal of developing sustainable
tourism in some of the
world’s most beautiful, yet fragile natural
environments received a boost earlier this
year with the announcement of
US$1 million to support a project that
links conservation and tourism at six
World Heritage sites. In the initiative, the
cosmetics company, Aveda, agreed to
give US $500,000 to the project, jointly
managed by UNESCO, the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the
RARE Center for Tropical Conservation.
The United Nations Foundation (UNF) is
matching the new funds with an equal
amount.
The project, which uses tourism to help
mitigate threats to conservation of
biological diversity, could become a
blueprint for initiatives elsewhere, where
the demands of tourists can be balanced
with the needs and cultural traditions of
local people, the landscape and
environment. By working with managers,
industry and local people the Heritage
sites project aims to bring together
conservation education, planning,
business development, training and
marketing techniques to create a model
for using tourism to promote the
protection of important habitats. A key
part of the project is to involve tour
operators in site specific activities so as
to create better tourism products and
sustainable management systems.
According to UNF’s Seema Paul, "There
is no doubt that tourism can be
beneficial, but there are not very many
successful models of eco-tourism -
meaning tourism that is ecologically
sustainable. Our idea is to experiment
with these programs in order to find the
best way to capture tourism revenues for
the local community and the site, and
then to apply those ideas to other sites." 
Key objectives of the World Heritage site
project are to ensure that tourism is
sustainable and does not negatively
impact these places. But there is also the
issue of why sites need to develop
tourism in the first place - to generate
income for parks and economic
incentives for local communities. Many
local managers of World Heritage sites
are looking to sustainable tourism as a
means of balancing the need for
economic development with
conservation, by bringing income into
cash-strapped park budgets and
impoverished local communities.
The World Heritage sites to benefit from
the new funding are the Sian Ka’an and
El Vizcaino biosphere reserves in Mexico,
Tikal national park in Guatemala, the Rio
Platano biosphere reserve in Honduras,
and the Komodo and Ujung Kulon
national parks in Indonesia.

UNESCO’s Associated Schools Network
Banking on youth
Monkey business in space
A bunch of primary school
kids from countries
bordering the western
Mediterranean are working
to save their sea from the
perils of pollution. And a big
Spanish bank, the Caja de
Ahorros del Mediterraneo
(CAM) is helping them get
the job done.
The children are all from
schools in southern Europe
and Northern Africa that 
are part of UNESCO’s
Associated Schools Network.
The bank has invested 
more than $100,000 in the
UNESCO/ASPnet Western
Mediterranean Project’s
activities since 1996. It has
made three environmental
education centers available
where children and teachers
can attend day-long training
sessions, and financed
regional summer camps for
students and teachers,
drawing and photo contests,
and the project’s
coordination. The bank has
also paid for several multi-
lingual publications, including
a CD-ROM on the project,
and teaching materials.
UNESCO presented its
Picasso medal to the bank’s
president, M. Vicente 
Sala Bello, in recognition of
the CAM’s support for the
project.
UNESCO and the European Space Agency
have joined forces to check on the health of
the gorilla population in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
The gorillas are having a tough time of it. Since the mid-1990s
they’ve had to share their homelands – notably the World
Heritage listed Kahuzi-Biega National Park – with tens of
thousands of refugees, who’ve fled the numerous political
upheavals in the countries around Africa’s Great Lakes region.
Seeking food and shelter, the refugees have cut down vast
swathes of forest and hunted the gorillas for their meat or
to sell them to traffickers who resell them to the highest bidder
as pets.
The destruction of the gorillas’ habitat has been further
aggravated by the discovery of coltan (colombo tantalite),
in the region. This precious hardening agent for metal is used
in a range of high-tech industries, including the manufacture
of mobile telephones.
The World Conservation Union (IUCN) reports that the illegal
mining of this substance in Kahuzi Biega and the Okapi
Wildlife Reserve in the east of the country is “seriously
impacting on the ecology of these sites,” and that “the wildlife
is being des-troyed at an alarming rate.”
The precise extent of the damage though is not known. 
To help answer that question, UNESCO is working with the
European Space Agency (ESA) to analyse satellite images of the
region. Such analysis will allow the experts to evaluate the
degradation of the primates habitat, and allow UNESCO and
local authorities to then work out ways of improving the
situation.
Other leading space agencies, including NASA and the
Canadian Space Agency are also interested in coming on board.©

To
help save endangered
languages, Discovery
Channel, the world’s
leading non-fiction enter-
tainment channel, has joined
forces with UNESCO. 
This new partnership,
finalized mid-April, will serve to
the channel’s fans in 154
countries more aware of the
world’s extraordinary linguistic
heritage.
Under the agreement, UNESCO
will provide Discovery with
critical information about
specific cultures and languages
at risk (see p.37). The
organization will also facilitate
contacts with prominent
linguists and researchers also
working to save the some 3,000
languages considered under
threat. In return, the channel
will produce special
programmes for broadcast in 33
languages to the  125 million
households Discovery reaches
outside the United States.
As a result of globalisation
and the homogenizing influence
of information technology,
thousands of languages could be
lost of this century. Yet, a
language under threat, or even
considered as having died out,
can be saved through pro-active
language policies. At the end of
the 80s in Japan, for example,
there were only eight people left
on the island of Hokkaido who
knew how to speak Aïnu.  A
museum devoted to the
language was established and
courses offered to young people
and today Aïnu is on its way
back. Even those languages
considered extinct can be
“raised from the dead”. Such is
the case with Cornish, in
England, which died out in 1777
but has been  in recent years,
with nearly 1,000 people now
speaking it as a second
language.
The UNESCO-Discovery
Channel partnership is also
supported by the UN Works
Programe, which aims to make
the activities of the UN family
and their impact on people’s
lives better known  throughout
the world.
The language of Discovery

science is largely a male profession”

UNESCO/L’Oréal: For Women in Science
The wealth and glamour of 
L’Oréal, a world-famous cosmetics
company, transformed the grand hall at
UNESCO headquarters on March 6th. As
posh Parisians strained to see the opera diva
Elisabeth Vidal, spotlights also beamed on a
group of female scientists, more accustomed
to microscopes rather than microphones. 
Yet they were the stars of the ceremony - the
winners of this year’s L’oréal prizes “For
Women in Science.” and the
UNESCO/L’Oréal fellowships. 
UNESCO’s Director General, Koichiro
Matsuura, and Lindsay Owen-Jones,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
L’Oréal, presented the awards, established
through a joint initiative in 1998 to recognize
the outstanding achievements of women
scientists and to encourage others to pursue
the same caliber of research.
The prizes each worth $20,000 were
awarded to five women from different
continents The winners were selected by an
international jury of renowned scientists and
represented a wide range of study. Nagwa
Meguid has been working to prevent and
treat genetic illnesses common to her native
Egypt. Ana Maria López-Clomé has bolstered
the reputation of Mexican research through
her study of retina diseases leading to
blindness. A world authority on leprosy,
Indira Nath has been developing medication
and vaccines for treating this disease that
affects 1.5 million people in her country,
India. Finally, Shirley Tilghman, originally
from Canada, has revolutionized genetics by
showing that a gene’s expression depends on
whether it was inherited from the mother or
father. 
The UNESCO/L’Oreal fellowships, each
worth $10,000, were awarded to ten young
female scientists engaged in promising
research projects around the world. For
example, Namrita Lall of South Africa has
isolated a plant compound with great
potential for treating tuberculosis, while in
Bangladesh, Hasina Akhter has been
genetically engineering rice to withstand the
saline conditions of coastal areas.

The
year 2002 has
been proclaimed
United Nations
Year for Cultural Heritage. At a time
when crimes against culture have become familiar
alongside political violence – as in Bosnia, 
or Afghanistan– UNESCO is trying to get another
message across.
Heritage is a target of destruction in wartime, 
as a way of “breaking” the enemy, but it can also
help a country heal its wounds and rebuild 
(see pages 12-17) and contribute to peace and
development.
Cultural heritage is not just old stones. 
It also includes the most abstract forms of human
creativity, such as the processes of creating
knowledge and know-how, languages, performance
art, music, social and religious ceremonies, oral
tradition and cultural places where remarkable
human activity takes place.
For the first time, on 18 May 2001, UNESCO
announced a list of the first 19 selections for its
new masterpieces of oral and intangible heritage of
humanity label. The Organization is also drafting
an international convention that would protect such
heritage from destruction or from being reduced
to simply “quaint” objects by cultural uniformity,
wars or mass tourism. UNESCO’s photo library 
shows here some of these intangible masterpieces,
alongside cultural World Heritage sites.

provide education for the
200,000 refugees of school age
in the Middle East. Another
important activity was the aid
provided to homeless children.
In Europe, 13 million children
were made homeless by the war,
and the number in Asia ran
into tens of millions. UNESCO
helped to create “The
International Federation of
Children’s Communities”,
coordinating the 200 children’s
communities for war orphans,
established in Europe during the
immediate post-war period.

3 November 1958:
UNESCO’s new buildings are officially opened
A symbolic
modernity
Online visit
UNESCO Headquarters buildings and the art works
they contain can be seen at the website:
www.unesco.org/visit/fr/frames/v4/build.htm
UNESCO’s special mission – to build peace on
the foundation “of the intellectual and moral
solidarity of mankind” – called for a grand
architectural statement. This was achieved, according
to Luther Evans, the Organization’s then Director-
General. At the opening of the new building,
he praised its “harmony” which, he said “attains
the purity of a symbol”.
The two years of surveys and research before
actual construction began included broad cooperation
between the greatest architects of the time – Walter
Gropius (United States), Le Corbusier (France),
Ernesto Rogers (Italy), Sven Markelius (Sweden)
and Lucio Costa (Brazil).
The planners conceived a big work of art and
from the beginning the architecture was blended with
paintings, sculpture, tapestry and other artistic forms.
Control of the project was given to three architects.
Bernard Zehrfuss (France) was in charge of the
overall planning. Marcel Breuer (United States)
conceived the main building in a Y-shape and the
Conference Hall in the shape of an egg. Luigi Nervi
(Italy) designs the 72 ribbed beton brut pillars on
which the main building rests.
UNESCO finally moved into its new home on
3 November 1958, on a three-hectare site donated
by the French government at the Place de Fontenoy,
next to the École Militaire and not far from the
Champs de Mars – “in a quintessentially French
landscape” as Evans put it.

Biosphere reserves
Special places for people and nature
Thirty years ago, an international group
of ecologists began experimenting with a radical new
concept, sustainable development. But instead
of debating the merits of the concept and its tools
in university halls or institutes, they set up a series
of “open-air” laboratories or biosphere reserves
through UNESCO’s Man and the Biosphere (MAB)
programme. Those testing grounds now span
thousands of kilometres, from the Egyptian desert
to the tundra of Greenland. Moreover, the importance
of the original experiment intensifies daily, with
practically every plant species or water source
affected one way or another by unbridled population
growth and economic consumerism.
“Biosphere Reserves – Special Places for People and Nature”
traces the progress and pitfalls of MAB’s quest to develop
the concept and tools of sustainable development. By
recounting the history of MAB, the authors take a critical
look at conservation. In the not-so-distant past, colonial and
romantic notions of pristine landscapes were used to brand
indigenous peoples as enemies of reserves from southern
Africa to northern America. Yet today, growing respect
for indigenous land rights takes on an ecological dimension
as scientists find that cultural diversity plays an essential role
in preserving biodiversity. The book provides several
examples in which biosphere reserves play pivotal roles in
current environmental debates.
For example, the number of species threatened with
extinction far outstrips resources available for conservation.
As a result, many ecologists are looking at the MAB network

to contribute to the protection of “biological hotspots”,
where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are
undergoing major loss of habitat. However, other experts
fear that by focusing on hotspots, we may indirectly give
the green light to ravage or neglect areas surrounding
areas, which require protection. 
This book will serve as a useful guide for anyone
involved or interested in the MAB network- from
national leaders to research students and even local
farmers. After laying the analytical and historical
foundations of the MAB concept as
well as major environmental
conventions, the book presents
concise portraits of diverse
reserves to highlight
accomplishments as well as
difficulties encountered in
promoting sustainable
development in different socio-
economic, cultural and geographic
contexts. The Maya Biosphere
Reserve of Guatemala, for
example, has been engulfed
by a steady stream of poor settlers
in search of land, which threatens
the fragile ecology, economy and
social relations with the indigenous population. A major
effort is now underway to diversify local income. Other
reserves offer important lessons on rehabilitating
degraded ecosystems, such as the mangroves of Can Gio
in Viet Nam. After 25 years of intensive efforts to recover
this delicate ecosystem, national and local authorities
are now trying to integrate protective measures with
plans to enlarge local fisheries.
From the monitoring of invasive alien plant species
to long-term studies on forest chimpanzees, the book
shows how communities and leaders of the reserves have
dealt with very different financial resources. Canadian
authorities use the latest satellite images to track
landscape changes, while in western Africa, reserves
are investing in solar-powered ranger stations and health
clinics for local communities. Local herders in both
the Bookmark reserve in southern Australia and
the Xilingol reserve of Inner Mongolia are working
together to find ways to better manage semi-arid grazing
lands. Innovative twinning projects of this kind
highlight another key MAB ingredient: regional and
international co-operation.

In the southern region of the Czech Republic, the Tr̆ebon̆
Basin has been shaped by human activities for more than
eight centuries. The result is a diverse semi-natural
countryside – a mosaic of more than 500 artificial
fishponds, deciduous and coniferous forests, meadows,
fields and wetlands crossed by numerous small streams,
canals and dykes. Inscribed on the list of UNESCO’s world
Network of Biosphere Reserves in 1977, Tr̆ebon̆ is also one
of about 60 reserves worldwide that are part of the Ramsar
Convention on Wetlands. 
This volume of the Man and the Biosphere series,
renowned for its scientific rigour and precision, presents the
major research findings of nearly one hundred researchers
studying at Tr̆ebon̆ over the last few decades. These
scientists have worked at a wide range of different
disciplines, space and time scales as well as levels of
biological complexity, from the cellular to the ecosystem.
Their research findings are grouped in five sections: the key
role of wetlands in the Tr̆ebon̆ Basin; fishpond management
and its ecological consequences; the wetlands surrounding
an ancient man-made lake; marginalized mires and
peatlands; and future prospects for the Tr̆ebon̆ wetlands,
including their ecological and socio-economic functions.

Languages
in Danger
of Disappearing
New revised edition
Close to half of the 6,000
languages spoken in the world
are doomed or likely to
disappear in the foreseeable
future. The disappearance of any
language is an irreparable loss
for the heritage of all
humankind. This new edition
of the “Atlas of the World’s
Languages in Danger
of Disappearing”, first published
in 1996, is intended to give a
graphic picture of the magnitude
of the problem in many parts
of the world. The reader will
find a comprehensive list
of languages in danger and
a concise summary
of the worldwide language
endangerment situation.

Children have the right to express their
views freely in all matters affecting them,
states Article 12 of the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. A right that is almost
never enforced as far as their urban
environment is concerned, where more than
half the children of the world live. This is a
pity, because when children are given a
chance to express their views and to
participate in urban decision making, as the
Growing up in Cities Project did in eight
countries between 1996 and 1998, they
know better than adults the local barriers
and resources that shape the quality of their
life. And they speak up for secure housing,
affordable education and transportation,
freedom of movement, accessible green
spaces and recreation places, and safe,
animated street life. These are the qualities
of better cities for everyone. By taking part
in decisions, young people also have
opportunities to break down
misunderstandings between generations and
learn essential skills of citizenship, as shown
with the examples of Melbourne and
Johannesburg, two cities which have
integrated the children’s recommendations. 
STOP PRESS: GUIC has won the
prestigious 2002 EDRA/Places Research
Award. EDRA is the Environmental

journal, both based in the USA. 
GUIC was selected ahead of 115 other
candidates.
Growing up in an Urbanising World
analyses the GUIC UNESCO project,
developed through the MOST programme
(Management of Social Transformations).
The book is accompanied by a practical
manual based on concrete examples,
“Creating Better Cities with Children and
Youth”. It explains how to develop and
implement a plan of action so that the
participation of children and youth in local
policies can become a sustainable reality.
