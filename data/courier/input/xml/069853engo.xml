For 100,0
T
he unesco courier is pleased to announce that the number of paid sub¬
scriptions has now passed the 50,000 mark.
This was the first goal set early this year when the Editors agreed to spare no
effort to bring readers a better, more interesting magazine with each succeeding
issue. New features have been added, the number of pages has been increased, a
high quality white paper has been adopted, and both the contents and general
appearance have been appreciably improved.
Today, the unesco courier has the highest paid circulation of any periodical
published by the United Nations or any of its affiliated international agencies.
On this occasion, the Editors wish to express their appreciation to all readers
throughout the world for their continued, enthusiastic support, for their many letters
of praise and encouragement, and particularly for their magnificent response in
renewing subscriptions before the new increased rates go into effect on January 1,
1956. (One reader submitted a renewal for six years. The Editors regret that sub¬
scriptions cannot be accepted for more than three years at the present rates.)
Several years ago, Mexico launched a great and successful campaign against
illiteracy with the slogan "Each One Teach One". The Editors have adopted a simi¬
lar phrase for a new campaign which has as its goal 100,000 subscribers. The phrase
is : "Each One Reach One."
With this issue of the unesco courier, the Editors invite every subscriber to take
advantage of the current annual subscription rate of 300 French francs, 6/-, $1.50
by sending in a minimum of one gift subscription for a friend or relative. Many
subscribers have already led the way by accompanying their renewals with four
or five gift subscriptions.
As of January 1, 1956 the new annual rate will be 400 French francs ; 8/- or
$2.00. Gift subscriptions and renewals will be accepted at the current rate of
300 French francs; 6/- or $1.50 if postmarked not later than December 31, 1955. The
unesco courier is an ideal Christinas present which your friends will enjoy IF you
post your gift subscription today.
So please don't wait. Join the unesco courier in its current campaign for
100,000 subscribers. Each one reach one. Send in your gift subscriptions today.

"Woman power" is today an increasingly vital
factor in the economic life of most countries
as millions more women take up jobs in
industry and commerce. Conditions in modern
factories are vastly different from those under
which women worked even half a century
ago. Shorter hours and health and safety
regulations are now imposed by law. This
young woman factory employee wears a new
type of face guard for protection against
flying particles of wood or metal.

It is no mere accident that the human race lias been
given the name Homo Sapiens. Women make up
half of humanity and in many countries outnumber
the men. Yet for centuries they have been treated
as inferior beings. They have been hewers of wood and
drawers of water; they have worked harder for a smaller
material reward and enjoyed a humbler status in the
eyes of society. They have received less education,
have had less protection before the law, and have been
denied even the most elementary civic rights.
Some women, it is of course true, have had more noble,
more important roles. Down through the ages there
have been queens and women rulers. Hut almost always
the story has been the same : either virtual serfdom or
royal status. The notion of equality, of women recog¬
nized as citizens on an equal footing with men is a
totally new concept which rightfully belongs to our pre¬
sent century.
It is a long step from the Roman woman held in per¬
petual tutelage to England's Mary Wollstonccraft and her
"Vindication of the Rights of Women" published at the
close of the 18th century. It is perhaps a longer step
from the woman in her home among her children to the
woman executive or the woman delegate at an interna¬
tional congress, acting on an equal basis with her male
colleagues. Countless women have taken this last step
in the past 50 years and many more will certainly take
it in the years ahead.
The equal status of women is now recognized by a
large number of countries. Women's rights are affirm¬
ed in the Charter of the United Nations and were pro¬
claimed for the entire world in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, adopted seven years ago, on Decem¬
ber 10. 1948 : "Free and equal in dignity and rights... "
"without distinction of any kind such as race, colour,
sex..."
In its Constitution, Unesco's purpose is defined as
promoting collaboration among nations through educa¬
tion science and culture "in order to further universal
respect for justice, for the rule of law and for the human
rights and fundamental freedoms... without distinction
of race, sex, language or religion." To realize this pur¬
pose, the Constitution adds, Unesco will "give fresh im¬
pulse to popular education and to the spread of cul¬
ture... by instituting collaboration among the nations to
advance the ideal of equality of educational opportunity
without regard to race, sex or any distinctions, economic
or social..."
On the occasion of Human Rights Day 1955, the
Unesco Courier devotes this issue to a report on the pro¬
gress made by women in recent years in their struggle
for equality with men.

ON THE MARCH
Mrs. ALVA MYRDAL, recently ap¬
pointed Swedish Minister to India,
Burma and Ceylon, is a leading authority
on women's rights. Born in Uppsala,
she founded, and for twelve years direct¬
ed, the Swedish Training College for
Pre-School Teachers. She joined the
Secretariat of the United Nations in
1949 as Principal Director of the
Department of Social Affairs. For the
past four years Mrs. Myrdal has been
Director of the Department of Social
Sciences in Unesco. Mrs Myrdal is the
author of several important sociological
works. Her most recent book, " Wo¬
men's Two Lives", written with Viola
Klein, will be published next year.
UNESCO
On a visit to Japan a few years ago a Tokyo newspaper
asked me to compare Japanese women with those of
my own country Sweden. I remember answering
that the main difference was that the women of Japan
were advancing at a much more rapid pace. So rapid in
fact that it was hard to foresee how the new Japanese
Woman would ultimately shape her own future.
Japan has been telescoping into the short space of a few
years changes that have been going on in the West for
a century or more. Before 1945 Japanese women had no
civil rights. They could not vote or own property ; their
husbands were often chosen for them by others, and they
could not seek divorce whatever the circumstances. Tra¬
ditionally their role was one of complete inferiority to men.
'A DOG, A WOMAN, A WALNUT TREE, the more you beat them the better they be, ran
the old adage which men supported with laws establishing the inequality of the sexes. After a long
struggle, women in many lands have won the right to equality in all fields of human endeavour.
By 1950 some 15 million women had registered at the
noils. In January 1953 Japanese women's organizations
totalled almost seven million members. And today many
women are entering new careers in industry, commerce, the
government and diplomatic service and the liberal profes¬
sions.
Ours is an age of rapid, drastic changes. Almost no¬
where can we still find the calm and tranquility of the past
when life continued unmodified for generation after genera¬
tion. Everywhere today there is stirring and movement, if
not unrest. Even in those countries where women seem,
outwardly at least, to be an immobile, voiceless mass, the
influences working upon them and the images entering
their minds are new and different. And these must be
having some effect and must be causing
some stir or agitation.
But is this ferment of new ideas a
creative, positive thing, or is it no more
than a form of restlessness? Is it being
organized and directed into some kind of
pattern which we can recognize as pro¬
gress? Or is it just leading to disorgani¬
zation! disintegrating the world of
women without giving them a better life
in return?
Whatever our opinion may be about
what is occurring today, one thing seems
clear to me: It is impossible for any so¬
ciety today to call itself advanced or to
embark on the road to technological
advancement and at the same time con¬
tinue to maintain women in their old
inferior roles.
That a tremendous change is taking
place in the role of women all over the
world would hardly seem like big news
to a Westerner. Apart from interna¬
tionally-known figures like Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt, Mrs. Pandit and some famous
writers and scientists, the modern type
of woman is taken pretty much for grant¬
ed in the West. Since the early "eman¬
cipation" period of the 1900's when the
"blue stocking" was greeted with a smirk

or a lifted eyebrow, the West has travelled a long way. Today
the successful career woman, the top executive, the woman
Member of Parliament, the woman lawyer, doctor or scientist
is no longer a novelty. She is accepted in a matter-of-fact
way and treated like any other colleague.
To me this fact is so important that I would put it at the
top of the list of major contemporary achievements in what
we commonly call the Western world. But it also applies to
countries in Eastern Europe, and to a lesser extent, to others
in Asia such as India where the Minister of Health, Rajku-
mari Amrit Kaur, for example, is judged not as a woman but
on the quality of her work as an official.
Although women have practically achieved equal rights
with men in the advanced countries, there are still quite a
number of "buts" and "ifs" to be taken into account. Ne¬
vertheless there can be little doubt that
the inequalities that still persist, parti¬
cularly those affecting women's civic and
economic rights, will be largely eliminat¬
ed in time.
It will take much longer though to
change public opinion. People cling to
old ideas even after these have ceased to
correspond to the facts for many years.
This explains why public opinion polls on
women, including the replies given by
women themselves, are so disheartening.
Thoughtless repetitions of old, time-worn
opinions ("A woman's place is in the
home!" "A woman shouldn't continue to
work after having children") figure pro¬
minently beside the more considered
views of those who check their "opinions"
with another compartment in their brain
which has accepted women's role in
employment as well as in the home.
Dangerous old idea
This is particularly dangerous in that
it perpetuates the idea that mother¬
hood and full partnership in eco¬
nomic and civic life are completely
irreconcilable when the facts prove they
are not. The present lifespan of women
in the industrialized countries now
averages more than 70 years. This
means that a girl who marries between
20 and 25 can look forward to some
50 more years of life. This leaves her
time both for a period of motherhood
(usually though not necessarily some¬
what shorter now than in grandmother's
time since she has fewer children), and
for a period of employment and com¬
munity activity (no shorter than for men
and unmarried women in grandfather's
time).
But let us glance at other parts of the
world. The problems and the prospects
are not the same, but the signs of pro¬
gress are just as marked. From my
personal observations abroad on behalf
of Unesco and from the studies which
Unesco itself has instigated, I have ga¬
thered deep impressions of the rapid
progress being made in respect of
women's rights in countries where mo¬
dernization and industrialization are in
full swing. Japan, which I have already
mentioned, Pakistan and the Arab
World are cases in point.
While in these countries neither the
prolongation of life nor the general level
of education have as yet brought all women to a new
phase of development, a new type of woman is visibly
and forcibly emerging. Relatively small in number, groups
of these women today form a nucleus of female
leadership. They have already enjoyed secondary schooling
and many even a university education. They are now receiv¬
ing training for participation in community and other civic
activities on a volunteer basis. Although this, of course, has
definite shortcomings in comparison with work in officially
recognized positions, it has given women more of an
opportunity than most men have to learn businesslike me¬
thods and efficiency in organization. Their reliability and
honesty will make them definite political assets to their coun¬
tries, once they become fully accepted.
Although their present rate of progress Is as spectacular as
that of their sisters in the more developed countries, their
problems are not the same. They still have to be fully in¬
tegrated into their national society. However, they seem to
have been able to find a key to the combination of mo¬
therhood and a socially active life. It is a remarkable fact
indeed that most of these women leaders are married and
mothers of children, unlike the leaders of the "suffragette"
movements earlier in the century in western Europe.
Their principal problem is the need to share their own ad¬
vances with other women in the poorer strata of society, who
outnumber them enormously. This problem was examined
this year in the Lebanon at a conference of 40 women leaders
from five Arab countries.
Their most immediate practical concern was how to reach

needs serve as a guide for social reforms, bringing education
to them and opening employment opportunties at all levels in
the economy.
Another problem, which is as yet perhaps not sufficiently
sensed by women in countries where economic development is
going forward with rapid strides, is the need to avoid making
the transition from old to new in such a precipitate way that
national cultural characteristics and values are lost. It is
not merely sufficient to borrow a number of new patterns
from countries which have already '"arrived."

culture has its own sense for colours, forms and textures, as
well as for their harmonization with each other. This sense
has been conditioned by long training, together with a
wealth of remaining environmental impulses. It is hardly to
be expected that a woman trained and conditioned in one
particular culture can utilize things from an alien culture
and do so with the mastery which spells perfection. The East
cannot compete with the West in tailored suits and mahogany
furniture, nor can the women in the West expect to compete
with her Indian sister in wearing a sari. The world just now
requires all the cultural assets which it has, and what it does
not need is the pauperization of these assets in the name of
uniformity.
Both the United Nations and Unesco have been active for
many years in efforts to promote respect for Women's Rights
throughout the world.
When the United Nations was created in 1945 it proclaimed
in its Charter "'faith in fundamental human rights, in the
dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights
of men and women". Since then the U.N. has been in¬
strumental in ensuring that tens and tens of millions of
women throughout the world were granted an elementary
right which had been denied them before, participation in
the civic affairs of their country.
As early as 1946, the United Nations set up its Commission
on the Status of Women which it charged with the monu¬
mental task oí surveying the political, economic, civil,

WIVES TAKE HOME PAY CHECKS
In most countries nursing has long been a traditional woman's occupation
though it only became an exacting profession requiring long training and
special qualifications less than a century ago. The American nurses, right,
are however a relatively minor group of the " women at work " in their
country where over 20,000,000 are employed in the various branches of
the nation's economy. That nearly half9,250,000are wives is explained
by the fact that people are getting married much younger and husbands do
not always earn enough to buy the automobiles, food freezers, television
sets and other things by which modern standards of living in the U.S.A.
are set. The future of U.S. women who want to work seems rosy. The
U.S. Secretary of Labour recently declared: "The demand for women's ser¬
vices will continue to grow. They will be asked to fill new jobsjobs
they have had little opportunity of filling until today."

NEW LEADERS OF CEYLONS
VILLAGE LIFE
Eighty-five percent of Ceylon's population lives in rural areas and among
these village dwellers the welfare of the community depends largely on its
womenfolk. One of the Government's chief resources in helping rural
women to work for their own educational, economic and cultural progress
is the Lanka Mahila Samiti (Ceylon Women's Institutes) movement founded
25 years ago. Work by these institutes covers health, general education,
rural development and industries. Training women for village leadership
in these fields is given at a central school at Kaduwela, near Colombo.
Left and centre, women trainees practise home garden cultivation with

social and educational status of women in all countries. The
basic feature of its work and the one which has been marked
witn the most forthright success has been its campaign to
gain universal recognition of women's right to vote and enjoy
political rights on an equal footing with men. In December
1952, an International Convention on the Political Rights of
Women was opened for signature (40 countries have now sign¬
ed) ; the Convention entered into force in July 1954, 22 count¬
ries now having ratified it.
The U.N. is continuing its work on a two-fold plan: firstly, ,
through a painstaking survey of present legal provisions in
order to draw attention to the many flaws and loopholes in
the protection of women's rights. Secondly, through a
progress report made public each year with the backing of
the General Assembly to act as a kind of public opinion
group" on recalcitrant states.
In field after field this international clarification of the
issues has taken place, resulting in a whole series of infor¬
mative reports which present the real situation today on a
married woman's right to her own nationality, on the right
to own property in her own name, to her right (surprisingly
often trampled under foot) to custody over her own children.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) has dealt with
the problems of equal pay for equal work, working conditions
for women and opportunities for vocational education.
As for Unesco itself, it has devoted its efforts to trying to
improve the status of women by drawing attention to the
progress or lack of progress achieved in woman's access to
education, and by undertaking special investigations into the
complex factors which either hinder or favour woman's
progress.

WOMEN ON THE
MARCH (Cont'd)
Lost homes and lost husbands
tional Bureau of Education in Geneva, Unesco has investi¬
gated the educational opportunities of women in three widely
differing countries, Chile, India, and Yugoslavia (published
as "Women and Education").
Of considerable importance are the series of investigations
now being made into the deep-seated social taboos which
work against a more speedy acceptance of the true equality
of women and hence against the full utilization of "woman
power" by particular countries. Unesco has helped to orga¬
nize comparative studies on such matters as the trials and
tribulations of women's participation in the political life of
Europe (see page 21); of the inherent traditional obstacles
to woman's access to education in Japan, Mexico, and Pakis¬
tan; of the active part played by women in local communities
in Southern Asia.
Many of these studies have as yet not been published, but
all of them contain challenging and often entertaining in¬
formation. As Professor Maurice Duverger, author of
Unesco's "The Political Role of Women" which has just been
published writes: "There is no more an inferior sex than
there are inferior races or inferior classes. But there is a
have been expected to react in this way and have not been
drawn into the process of change and development.
Let us take the story of Jinja in the Uganda. Here, the
installation of a giant electric power station at Owen Falls
on the Nile sparked a process of extremely rapid industriali¬
zation. Elements of the time-worn methods of agriculture
were cleared from the town and a seething new life began to
stir. There was plenty of work, but for every seven men
employed there was only one woman. For these men work
meant abandoning their home life for barrack-like construc¬
tions with western-type collective services and sanitation.
Revolt against male authority
Mrs. Rhona Sofer, in her report on this question to the
UNEsco-sponsored symposium at the World Population
Conference in Rome last year described households in
Bukesa the most urbanized centre, as having no adult
females and only 4% with childrenone child each. "The

WELDING TO SCULPTURE
More than 2,080,000 women are
employed in scientific, cultural or
teaching institutions of the Soviet
Union. About 77,000 are doing scien¬
tific work. There are more than a
million women teachers in primary
and secondary schools. Women tech¬
nicians and engineers number more
than half a million. Women play an
important role in politics: 348 are
deputies in the U.S.S.R. Supreme

sex, and there are classes and races who have come to believe
in their inferiority because they have been persuaded of it in
justification of their subordinate position in society."
The close relation between economic change and women's
"emancipation" (which has been the main theme of this
article) makes it quite important to discover women's role in
the very earliest stages of economic development. Astonish¬
ingly little knowledge exists on this subject; and it would
almost seem as if previous economic studies of industrializ¬
ation had had a blind spot as far as women were concerned.
Unesco has, therefore, just begun an extensive field study on
the emergence of the first leaders among women in West
Africa. This may help to throw light on some of the para¬
mount problems.
Do they hinder social change ?
For example, do women tend to slow down the processes
of social change? Do they, like the old people, remain
in the safety and security of the village when their
adventurous menfolk go elsewhere to seek new employment?
Is it the women who refuse to give up the old and proven
ways of housekeeping, agriculture and medicine rather than
accept improvements? Are they the ones who cultivate
superstitions and fear the light of fact and reason?
To a certain extent women have come to represent the
status quo, and to act as deterrents to change because they
urban wife," she added, "finds herself without the functions
that gave her status in the traditional system", and is unable
to guide her children into the new mode of living. Most
Africans in Jinja today find that their early indoctrination
and social training have not equipped them to deal with the '
pattern of living with which they are now confronted.
So, the result of economic advancement is an urban life in
a collectively-organized male society where the men are or
consider themselves bachelors, while the women are either
left behind or are in revolt against the traditions of paterna¬
lism. Once they come to town, women strongly resist their
husbands' desire to make them subordinate with the result
that, as Rhona Sofer reports, "the area has many disaffected
women who have left their husbands". Thus, backwardness
and disorganization appear to be the only alternatives open '
to women in this particular transition period.
At the same conference, however, a very different story
was told by Mrs. Yonina Talmon-Garber about Israeli
collective farm communities. There it is quite frequent that
women even women from African territories return from
Work to their homes and their children with new techniques
and ideas because they are given independent jobs. Similar
experiences to those recorded in Israel have been reported
by anthropologists and sociologists about specific situations
in Africa where care has been taken to provide women with
meaningful tasks and varied social contacts.

yet, does indicate therefore that women could fill the role of
true innovators and agents for introducing change. They
have the opportunity of bringing new ways of doing things,
with which go new lines of thought, directly to the place
where it is of most importance the home. Here, where the
influence extends throughout all members of the household
the mother is strategically placed for inducing social changes.
Unesco has, hitherto, in its work for fundamental educa¬
tion, and in more formal schooling work, proceeded on the
hypothesis of "no distinction between the sexes". Per se
this a laudable objective. But the social scientists are now
wondering whether it might not pay to blueprint a new kind
of development programme, with greater effect and advantage
to all, which would be channelled much more directly through
women.
It would mean equating new reforms to the actual pattern
of day-to-day life, to the demands of consumption, to
people's needs, and then letting it grow from these funda¬
mental factors until it encompasses the entire economic life.
The transformation of the social economy would then come
about as a result of changes in the household economy, and
not, as nearly always is the case, by increasing productivity
and leaving the lives of human beings to adapt as best they
can.
Of course, women are adaptable and will adjust themselves
according to de¬
mands. They can
ensure that the
introduction from
outside the home
of new conditions
and a new way
of life does not
cause too much
harm to the in¬
dividual human
beings. But there
are many signs
now that they
would wish to
give form and
substance them¬
selves to new
ways of life, and
not merely play a
passive role; they
would rather be
partners in the
great process
which is now re¬
shaping human
society; they are
ready to march
forward and en¬
sure that pro¬
gress is really
progress and not
simply change.
It is questions
such as these
which will one
day find a place on the agendas of meetings of the U.N. and
the Specialized Agencies. To take some examples : How
can technical assistance be utilized so as to bring women's
as yet largely dormant capacities into play for raising the
people's living standards? How can fundamental education
programmes be initiated so that the "multiplier effect" of
women as educational agents can be mobilized, and used as
the main proponents in order to reach into those parts of
cultural life as yet untouched by formal schools?
They want full partnership
When this day comes it will be understood throughout
the world, as it does not appear to be fully under¬
stood yet, that the acknowledgment of women's claim
to Human Rights is not just a question of giving benefits to
women, although these do mean much more symbolically to
women as they can thus feel the emotional security of having
their full worth as human beings recognized.
It is not only a question of making a reality of those egali¬
tarian principles, which all democracies must honour if they
are to justify the title of democracy. The real issue is some¬
thing much more fundamental: the participation of women
as full partners in the economic, social and cultural life of a
nation. When this is achieved, and women can play their
role to the full, the results in terms of well-being for the
peoples of the world will be immense.
From The Four Corners
GROWING LABOUR FORCE :
In the U.S.A. there are now over a million more
women than men in the age group from 20 to 75
and over (with the exception of the 55 to 59).
Women also have lower mortality rates and their life
expectancy is longer.
American women today are marrying younger,
having their children earlier, and bearing more se¬
cond, third and fourth children than in the 1920's.
Approximately one out of every three women in
the U.S.A. is employed outside her home. The total
figure runs to about 20 million. Some 50% of
these are married, and this figure marks an advance
of 20% since 1940.
RULERS OF THE ROOST:
Among, the Tchambuli tribes of New Guinea the
women completely dominate the men. They go
off to work each day and leave their menfolk at
home to play the flute, decorate themselves with
flowers and plan some amusement to entertain the
women when they return tired and hungry after a
day's work making nets and catching fish. The
Tchambuli women are affectionately scornful of
their men, whom they regard as rather frivolous,
emotional creatures, given to quarrelling and endless
chatter.
WOMEN ARMY DOCTORS :
Women doctors are now joining the Pakistan
Army Medical Corps as regular commissioned offi¬
cers. Pakistani women have also shown a keen
interest in civil defence, and have volunteered in
large numbers for basic general training. Centres
have been set up in Karachi for training women.
FIRST TRIBAL DEPUTY
In a white flower-embroidered tunic, with gold
earings and necklaces worked like lace by tribal
craftsmen, Aurora Montiel, addresses the Venezue¬
lan National Assembly in her tribal language. Re¬
presenting her tribe, the Uranis, she is the first
Indian woman to sit as a Deputy.
JILLS OF ALL TRADES:
What jobs do European woman do? If we take
France, as an example, we find the following statis¬
tics: there are more than 800 taxi drivers, 18 train
drivers, 4 000 pharmacists, 860 lawyers, 12 surgeons,
300 policewomen, 7 airport controllers, 320 drivers of
heavy goods vehicles and 2 400 doctors.
MODERN BREADWINNERS
In more than four million U.S. families, or one
out of every ten, a woman carries the main respon¬
sibility both for financial support and for family
planning.
In 1910 12,2 % of the total number of women em¬
ployed in the U.S.A. were engaged on newspaper and
magazine work. Today this figure has nearly tri¬
pled (32 %). This is by far the highest percentage
gain for any of the professions.

ARE WOMEN THE INFERIOR SEX?
No, declares a scientist,
Women are superior to men
by Ashley Montagu
I have spent a great part of my scientific and public life
bringing the facts of science to attest to the fact that no
people is in any significant way naturally superior to
another, and that such superiorities as any human group
exhibits as compared with another are acquired, and are
usually due to purely accidentally determined historical
causes. And yet, today, I have become identified with the
viewpoint, which I put forward as a scientific fact that one
group of humanity is naturally superior to the other, namely,
that women are naturally superior to menthe very opposite
of the view to which practically the whole of humanity has
subscribed, possibly from its very beginnings!
It has been obvious to practically everyone that by and
large men are in every way superior to women. Men are
stronger, more intelligent, less emotional, less flighty,
more creative, even the best cooks are men, and the most
successful designers of women's clothes are frequently men.
Has it not been the continuous experience of humanity that
men are superior to women? How is it possible even to ques¬
tion so age-old and time-honoured a fact?
As a scientist specializing in human naturell know very
well that what human beings often accept as â\fact may be
no more than a belief which has become so encrusted with
the moss of Time that neither its origin nor its true nature
is understood. The belief is a fact because everyone regards
it as so. As a scientist I am interested in discovering the
processes by which such a belief came to be accepted as a
fact, and to demonstrate whether the belief is true or false.
How the whole myth started
It is not difficult to understand how the belief in masculine
superiority came into being, but before we consider that,
let me say what the scientist understands by "natural",
and by "superiority". By "'natural" is to be understood what¬
ever is innate in one's biological constitution. By "'supe¬
riority" is to be understood the state of being adaptively
better or more efficient in some trait or quality than the
organism with which one is making the comparison.
Now, how did it come to be believed, and how is it that it
is so universally believed at the present time, that men are
naturally superior to women? The ähswer is simple: Men
are muscularly more powerful than women, women have
babies, women have to lead more sedentary lives than men,
because under primitive conditions, it is she who has to stay
at home and look after the young, while her husband travels
over the face of the land hunting for game.
This division of labour exists in all societies and exercise's a
powerful influence upon the socio-psychological development
of the sexes. The woman becomes parochial, the male
urbane. The woman's experience being largely limited to her
domestic functions she becomes a domesticated creature,
whereas her husband, as the hunter, learns a great deal
about the world in which he lives, he improves upon techni¬
ques of hunting, he devises new implements, he learns of
innumerable plants and animals, he enjoys large varieties of
experience which never fall to the lot of his wifein compari¬
son to her he knows and can do more about the world in
which they live than she will ever know or do not because
she is incapable of knowing and doing the same things (or
nearly so, for it is obvious that not being as muscularly
powerful as he is she will be unable to lift heavy animals or
Professor Ashley MONTAGU, or the United States has won especial note for his
work in race relations and he was a member of the two committees composed of
internationally-known scientists who drafted the Unesco statement on race based on
the most up-to-date scientific data. Professor Montagu's books include "On Being
Human', 'Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race", "An Introduction to
Physical Anthropology" and "The Natural Superiority of Women".

run as fast), but because she will not enjoy the necessary
opportunities to show what she can learn and do.
To the domesticated female the prowess of her male and
his superior knowledge and skill all bear testimony to the
accepted belief that men are naturally superior to women.
Once this belief is accepted and societies become more
complexly organized the male becomes more complexly
integrated into his position as the naturally superior
creature, and everyone learns to accept the inferiority
of the female as an established law of nature. But how
often have the laws of nature turned out to be nothing more
than the private and public prejudices of men!
Anyone can check the facts
The scientific fact is and a scientific fact is one that can
be verified by anyone who wishes to take the trouble to
do soi the scientific fact is that women are naturally
superior to men, and I would add that .we should all be
grateful that this is the fact, for in this fact lies the hope of
the world.
The most valuable trait that human beings can possess is
adaptability. This is the trait which enables human beings
to get along with their fellow human beings in such a way as
to contribute in a creative manner to the enlargement of
their potentialities for being warm, loving, co-operative
persons. Nature has endowed the female most abundantly
with all those potentialities which contribute to the develop¬
ment of this trait, and she has done so because it is the
female who must géstate the young, who must give birth to
and succour and nourish the young.
Unless the female is biologically endowed with this kind of
altruism the species would stand very little chance of sur¬
vival unless the male were so endowed, but he is not. The
male has to learn how to love; the female is biologically, by
nature, equipped to do so. Because she is the biologically
more valuable part of the species capital she has been
equipped by nature with the necessary superiorities which are
calculated to ensure the survival of the species. And this is
where we come to the proof of the natural superiority of the
female.
Beginning life as a double-X
The most important of the biological differences between
the sexes are those which determine the sexual differen¬
ces. These are the sex chromosomes. The sex chromo¬
somes are known as the X-and Y-chromosomes. X-and
Y-chromosomes are carried in the heads of the male sperma¬
tozoa. Whether the child is to be a male or a female depends
entirely upon whether it is a Y-or an X-chromosome which
fertilizes the maternal ovum. The female ova carry only
X-chromosomes. When a sperm carrying an X-chromosome
fertilizes an ovum, the resulting fertilized egg is XX, one X
from the male sperm and one X from the female ovum. Such
an XX egg always gives rise to a female. When a sperm
carrying a Y-chromosome fertilizes an ovum, the resulting
fertilized egg is XY, an X-chromosome from the ovum and a
Y-chromosome from the male sperm. Such an XY egg
always gives rise to a male.
The Y-chromosome is an incomplete chromosome, it is
much smaller than the X-chromosome and lacks many of its
properties and it is to these deficiencies that almost all of
the male's troubles and inferiorities as compared (Contd on
with the well-endowed double-X female can be ...

WORKING HER WAY
THROUGH COLLEGE
Nearly half the 103,070 students enrolled in
the universities and other institutes of higher
learning of the German Federal Republic during
the past university year were obliged to do
some part-time work to help pay for their stu¬
dies. Nearly 46,000 out of 86,000 men stu¬
dents and 2,928 out of I 6,780 women students
were " working their way through college ".
Here are some moments in a typical day of
Gerda Kasslan, a 21-year-old student (also
pictured on page I 3). Gerda sits in a crowded
lecture room at University of Freiburg im
Breisgau, later joins her friends in student's
room or else cooks a meal in her bedroom.
To help pay for her studies she works in a
museum. In her " spare time ", she is glad to
relax and listen to a musician friend playing
the violin.

A LONG ROAD FROM THE PLOUGH
by Elina Almasy
The scene is a poverty-stricken landscape somewhere in
the Carinthian mountains. In a barren-looking field
six women are at work. Summer is ending and the
time has come for ploughing. Three ploughs are turning
over the heavy soil and yoked to each is an ox and a woman.
This scene, pictured in an engraving dated 1872, gives some
idea of the lot of a European peasant woman a little over 89
years ago. It seems hardly believable and one's first reaction
is to wonder how men could have been such tyrants. But the
fault did not lie so much with the men as with the social and
economic conditions of the period. The peasant in 1872 had
in all probability no alternative but to yoke his wife alongside
hLs ox, as he himself was probably labouring for his master.
Communities still exist where women do the hard manual
labour while the men busy themselves with housework.
Strangely enough this is usually found amongst peoples who
give their womenfolk a leading role in the social hierarchy, in
the same way as in tribes where men are the leaders, there
has always been the tendency to treat domestic work with
contempt. The same idea was found in matriarchal commu¬
nities where the women banished men to the kitchen.
In families living off the land it was not, in general, so
much the tyranny of man which turned women into some¬
thing not much better than a beast of burden, but the gene¬
ral poverty. However, with technical progress and the intro¬
duction of rational agricultural methods, the life of the pea¬
sant women was greatly improved in practically all countries
of the world, and in general, independently of women's eman¬
cipation in the legal and political fields. This favourable
evolution is still going on.
During the past century when women began to seek ad¬
vantages from the social revolution and the new economic
opportunities opened up by increasing industrialization, the
problem of women's education immediately came to the fore.
This led to a struggle in which women demanded the right
of equal educational opportunities. In many countries it be¬
came a bitter struggle. To protect themselves from female
competition men resorted to some insidious methods. Pub¬
lic demand led to women being allowed to follow certain
trades and professions, but at the same time they were denied
the training to fit them for these callings. They were told,
for example, that the schools were full up. '
Medical schools open door first
The whole question of women's education is still far from
settled today. Throughout the world there are still
more female illiterates than male. In Russia the illi¬
teracy figure for women is three times that of the figure for
men. This year in the primary schools of India there are
16 million boys but scarcely 5 million girls. In Indonesia
such a shortage of schools exists that all secondary schools
have been closed to girls.
In the universities, the medical schools were usually the
first to admit women students. The U.S.A. had its first
woman doctor, Elizabeth Blackwell, in 1849. The University
of Cambridge opened its doors to women students in 1869 and
in 1870 women were given the right to study medicine at the
University of Paris. However, the other faculties at Paris
were slower to follow the example and in 1900 there was not
a single woman student studying law. Today, 25 % of all law
students in France are women.
Although much progress has been made some professions
are still closed to women. In the U.S.A. and Great Britain,
they are not allowed to work in the mines or in forestry.
France and Great Britain do not allow women to own
money changing offices or stockbrokers businesses. In Paris
Elina ALMASY, Norwegian sociologist was formerly head of research at the Oslo
Institute of Social Research. Articles on this page and page 28 are taken from a
sludy she completed last year, on women's progress in the world today.
women were not allowed on the floor of the Stock Exchange
until 1952. The Scottish Presbyterian Church allows women
to become preachers but its English counterpart does not.
The increasing share which women have obtained in
general economic affairs has led to significant changes in
day-to-day family life. In some countries women form a
large percentage of the total population at work in industry,
agriculture and commerce. Yugoslavia holds the record with
49%, followed by Rumania with 46%. France occupies
seventh place with 38%. In terms of the percentage of
women workers from the total female population Yugoslavia
again holds the world record with 57%.
At the other end of the scale, women in the Latin Ameri¬
can countries play only a very small part in the professions,
trade and industry. Out of 100 Mexican women only five are
employed. In Cuba the percentage scarcely reaches seven,
and in Honduras 7.5% However, in Colombia, by contrast,
47% of the women are doing active work.
Husband can veto bank account
Of all branches of industry, textiles employ the highest
proportion of women workers. In the U.S.A., the figure
is 77% and in Switzerland 65%. The Government of
the U.S.S.R. has ta;ken many measures to increase the role of
women in the economic life of the nation. It has also en¬
couraged women to take up scientific work. No fewer than
578 women have been awarded the Stalin Prize, among them
the eminent biologist Olga Lapechinskaja. From the millions
of factory workers 2,000 have been made "Heroines of Soviet
Labour", a title which carries a number of social privileges.
The legitimate claim for equal pay for equal work has now
been met in some countries, but many countries still do not
adhere to the international convention on this question.
It is interesting to compare the respective incomes earned
by men and women in the U.S.A. Among women, 48% earn
less than $1,000 a year; 36% earn between $1,000 and $2,000;
13% from $2,000 to $3,000, and only 3% have a salary of more
than $3,000. For the men 26% fall in the $3,000 plus
category; 29% earn between $2,000 and $3,000; 25% between
$1,000 and $2,000, and only 20% earn less than $1,000.
In France there are almost as many women heads of
businesses as there are men. However, a married woman in
France does not have the right to open a personal banking
account without the written consent of her husband, except
when a contract has been signed before marriage establishing
a division of property. As regards the management of
finances, women are still, as they were at the start of the
century, under the control of men in most countries.
Actually most governments today have not only given
working women equal rights equivalent salaries, possibilities
of promotion, etc.with men, but they have taken special
measures to ensure that women will not suffer any physical
harm from their work. In France, for example, women are
not obliged to work at night, and working hours are arranged
so that women can have 11 consecutive hours of rest during
the 24. In the U.S.A. women cannot be made to work
overtime, nor are they allowed to drive lorries of more than
five tons in weight. -
In most countries there are regulations obliging employers
to provide chairs for women workers so that they can rest
during the fixed breaks in the working day. There is an
international convention which has laid down rules regarding
the treatment of women workers who are expecting children.
They have the right to a special holiday, receive free medical
care and to be paid a salary wage bonus. After the birth of
her child, when the women worker resumes her duties, her
working hours must be arranged so that she can feed and
attend to her child in the best possible conditions.
A long road has indeed travelled since the days when
peasant women helped oxen to pull a plough.

THE UNFORGETTABLE
'WHITE GAP' DAY
One of the most important days in the life of
Swedish girl students is "White Cap" Day. It
is on this day that they will know whether, as a
result of their examinations, they are to be
"capped " or not. For weeks the young students
have undergone searching written and oral
examinations. And' in Sweden not only have
the students to pass the examinations, but they
are also marked for points on their school
records. The universities demand a minimum
number of points before they will admit candi¬
dates. In fact the Koralinum, the most impor¬
tant medical faculty in Sweden, demands such a
high percentage that only the most outstanding
are accepted.
But at last the long weeks of work are over, and
now the great question is "Who will be capped ?"
The answer will only be known on the Day of
the White Cap. Around four o'clock in the
afternoon parents, brothers, sisters and friends
gather in the school quadrangle to congratulate
the young college students. This first success is
celebrated in holiday mood. The groups of
well-wishers have brought flowers, presents and
balloons. They arrive in cars, hand-carts,
donkey-carts, and with them come the musi¬
cians who enliven things with popular songs.
As the hands of the clock near five, tension
mounts. Spies report supposed successes and
failures. Finally the doors are opened and the
girls appear in a long file. They sing, and call
out and wave to their parents and friends in
the crowd. As the song finishes the girls rush
headlong to greet their parents and tell them
the news. But they are immediately surrounded
by their colleagues who hoist them on their
shoulders and place the white caps on their
heads. Their parents embrace them, garland
them with flowers and give them balloons.
Accompanied by music from improvised bands
the girls are escorted to their cars, carriages and
carts, and the groups set out for their homes.
Once there they will sing and dance until late
into the night. This day of the white cap is one
never to be forgotten.
I. In columns the girls await the moment when
they can show themselves in the school quadran¬
gle. A thousand-strong crowd of parents and
friends is outside.
2.' Before coming down to the quadrangle the
girls make a brief appearance on the balcony.
3. A cortege under way complete with band and
donkey-cart.
4. Garlanded with flowers and carrying her
balloons a young student is serenaded in un¬
conventional fashion.
5. Chaired by somewhat over-enthusiastic
friends this girl looks as if she may lose her
cap sooner than she thought.
6. An unorthodox means of transport in
Stockholm's busy streets. This charming Swed¬
ish girl has been provided with an all-
weather carriage.
7. No carriages are needed for Kerstin, only
the willing shoulders of her student friends.

SWEDEN'S SCHOOLS FOR
GRACE AND BEAUTY
Sweden is known the world over for its gymnasts,
and it is from the I 9th century "Swedish drill"
that most modern systems of physical education
have been developed. For Swedish girls physi¬
cal education is an important part of their
general schooling. They learn how to walk
gracefully, how to keep their bodies supple and
how to give every movement of the body grace
and beauty. Throughout the Scandinavian coun¬
tries there are innumerable physical education
courses of this type, but no two have exactly
the same programme. Each course is led by either
a man or woman professor of physical education,
who guides the course along his or her own
personal lines. Here, Professor Ernst Idla
instructs a group of Swedish girl students. His
school of physical education is so successful that
it receives invitations each year to give exhibi¬
tions in countries throughout Europe and the
Americas. The balloon exercises, shown here,
are a speciality of Prof. Idla. They are of parti¬
cular importance in developing suppleness and
grace of movement.

E,ducation is recognized as the key
to the improvement in women's status.
It opens the door for women to new
professions and a new place in society.
Since 1946 Unesco has given special
emphasis to the problem of increasing
educational opportunities for women.
It has brought together educational
leaders from many countries to study
this problem. An Arab States Con¬
ference on free and compulsory edu¬
cation in 1954 and a Pan-Pacific
Women's Conference held in Manila
this year both gave the "access of
women to education" their chief
attention.
Unesco has investigated why pro¬
gress has been hindered in certain
countries. It has surveyed the reasons
why girls and boys do not get an equal
chance to go to school. It has issued
comprehensive reports on education
problems, such as: "Access of Women
to Education", "Women and Education
(India, Yugoslavia and Chile)" and
"Education of Women for Citizenship".
It has made country-wide surveys;
established fundamental education
training centres in the Middle East
and Latin America and sent experts
all over the world to help train women
teachers.
The facts and figures which follow
are taken from various Unesco reports
and studies on women's education.
ILLITERACY
I lliteracy throughout the world is
declining for both sexes, but it is de¬
clining more rapidly for men than for
women.
In only nine countries Bermuda,
Canada, Cuba, Hawaii, Jamaica, Span¬
ish Morocco, Sweden, the U.S.A. and
the Windward Islands is the illiteracy
rate lower for women than for men.
Female illiteracy usually runs much
higher, particularly in Asia, the Near
and Middle East and some parts of
Latin America. In countries of South-
East Asia female illiteracy averages
71 % as against 44 % for men. In Latin
America the figures are : 38.8 % for
men and 48.2 % for women.
About 30 % of the total population
of the world lives in countries where
female illiteracy in 1952 exceeded 50 %.
Only between 5 % and 10 % of the
world's population lives in countries
where female illiteracy is low.
In Europe literacy is usually much
higher, and in six European countries
Belgium, Finland, France, Italy,
Spain and Sweden the average illi¬
teracy rate for women is 13.4 %. The
average for men is only 3.8 % lower.
COMPULSORY
PRIMARY SCHOOLING
I N all countries where primary
schools are open to boys and girls there
are laws which oblige both sexes to
attend these schools for a specified
number of years, which differs from
country to country. Canada has eight
years of compulsory schooling for boys
and girls, Denmark has seven, Finland
has eight, France, the Netherlands and
Switzerland all have eight, the U.K.
has ten and the U.S.A. eight to 12.
Ochool registers of the following
countries show that 100 % of all the
girls between the ages of five and
fourteen go to school: Canada, the
U.S.A., Belgium, France, German Fede¬
ral Republic, Netherlands, U.K., Aus¬
tralia, New Zealand and Japan. In
most of them there are more women
teachers than men in the primary
schools. Examples are: U.S.A. 88 %
in 1951; Belgium 56 % in 1950; France
64 % in 1951; England and Wales 72 %
in 1951 and New Zealand 55 % in the
same year.
W:here there is compulsory educa¬
tion for girls, a Unesco report reveals
that this has a direct bearing on
family life. In such countries as Den¬
mark, the U.K., Sweden, the U.S.A.,
Australia and New Zealand the mor¬
tality rates per thousand live births are
at their lowest. But in other countries
where few girls go to school infant
mortality rates are very high from
115 to 200 or more per thousand births.
A lthough in Asia co-educational
primary schools are not the rule cer¬
tain countries, such as Burma, Ceylon,
Report card
on equal
education
the Philippines and Thailand, have
adopted the mixed primary school sys¬
tem. All these countries have shown,
according to the findings of a Unesco
study, an increase in the number of
girls going to school. In Burma there
was a 10 % rise in 12 years, Ceylon
showed an 8 % increase in 20 years,
and the Philippines and Thailand have
similar figures. The proportion of
women teachers in these schools in
Ceylon is 45 % (1952), Thailand 21 %
(1951), and the Philippines 61 % (1948).
In an investigation on the best me¬
thods to increase the numbers of girls
at school, Unesco has shown that
social aid measures yield practical
results. The provision of school meals,
clothing facilities, free distribution of
school materials and free board and
lodging have been introduced by many
countries to encourage girls to attend
school. Social workers are now being
employed by many schools to deal with
outside factors which affect school
attendance. As a result flexible school
schedules, whereby hours of work,
vacation periods, and weekly holidays
have been adjusted to suit local condi¬
tions, have been adopted. Other
measures include : curriculum revision;

SECONDARY AND
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLING
E UROPE and North America have the
largest proportion of girls in secondary
schools, according to a Unesco report
on the present position of free and
compulsory education. Girls and boys
have an equal chance of secondary
schooling in 14 European and 12 North
and Central American countries. No
European country has an enrolment
figure of less than 30 % for girls in
secondary schools.
kj everal Latin American countries,
where primary schools are open to
girls and boys, now give opportunities
for girls in secondary and vocational
schools. Among these are the Domini¬
can Republic, Panama, Chile and Col¬
ombia all of which have roughly
comparable figures. These work out at
between approximately 40 % and 50 %
of girls enrolled in secondary and vo¬
cational schools.
A,. recent Unesco report shows that
more and more countries are trying to
throw open their secondary schools
equally to girls and boys, and at the
same time to make part of the com¬
pulsory period of education for girls on
the secondary level. Some countries,
notably Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, the Netherlands, Sweden,
Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S.A.,
have attained equality at the secon¬
dary level for girls and boys. But, says
the Unesco report, in places where
there are six years or less of compul¬
sory schooling for girls, and the law is
imperfectly enforced, as in some Asian,
Latin American and African countries,
the proportion of girls in secondary
schools is low.
WOMEN TEACHERS
W,here women teachers outnumber
men in the primary schools the per¬
centage of girls attending schools in¬
creases from year to year. This im¬
portant point is brought out in a
Unesco report on women teachers and
teacher training. In countries such as
Argentina, Chile, Mexico the U.S.A.,
France, Sweden, the U.K. the Philip¬
pines and New Zealand where the per¬
centage of women teachers is equal to
or greater than that of men, there are
as many girls as boys in the primary
schools. However, in countries where
there are few women teachers such as
Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Egypt
and Turkey, the number of girls in
primary schools is low.

MILITANT SUFFRAGETTE speaks from the plinth atthe base of Nelson's
statue in Trafalgar Square, London (above), early in the First World
War. At this time, British suffragettes were not only demanding the
right to vote but also a share in the country's war effort (see posters

in rear). Suffragettes, like the one seated behind speaker, often carried
umbrellas. These were sometimes brought into play as " weapons "
in the clashes that occurred with the police. Below, a woman at
the polls in Australia, where women had the vote prior to 1914.
THERE are few modern countries which have not proclaimed
equality in the matter of political rights between men and
women nor failed to establish it in their constitutions, codes
and laws. But how far do the facts actually square with the law?
How much real equality in political matters goes with the legal
equality?
To find the answers to these questions, Unesco's Department of
Social Sciences carried out an investigation into the part played
by women in politics in four European countries. These countries
were chosen on the basis of fairly comparable economic development
and democratic beliefs, but at the same time on rather striking
differences in the social and political situations which led to the
granting of women's rights. They were:
Norway: where women were given the vote 50 years ago in the
course of gradual development towards full democracy ;
France: where women got the vote after the Second World War;
Yugoslavia: where a revolution in 1945 enabled women to obtain
full franchise ;
Germany: where, although women obtained political rights in
1919, normal development was interrupted by a period of totali¬
tarian government.
The results of the surveys were assembled by M. Maurice Duverger,
Professor of Political Science at the Universities of Paris and Bor¬
deaux, and published in the Unesco study "The Political Role of
Women". The situations revealed by the investigations and the
conclusions drawn from them by Professor Duverger form the basis
for the following article.
Between the part played by women in elections and the
part they play in political leadership a great difference
exists. A close look at women's political behaviour does
not confirm the classic democratic doctrine that government
reflects and represents the will of the people as expressed
at elections.
To judge by elections the proportion of women taking part
in political life is large, and differs little from that of men,
as regards either numbers or composition. There are gener¬
ally slightly more non-voters among women than among
men, and the woman's vote is generally slightly more conser¬
vative and more subject to religious influences. " But these
differences are small and apply only to a tiny fraction of
the female electorate. In certain exceptional circumstances,
these marginal differences may have a considerable influence
on the governmental majority and the trend of policy, but
they still remain marginal.
So far as government, in the broad sense of the term, is
concerned, the position is entirely different. Here the poli¬
tical role of women is extremely small and grows still smaller
as we approach the "'centre" of political leadership. There
are few women candidates at elections, fewer women mem¬
bers of parliament, still few(-r women ministers, and no
women heads of governments. (See diagram page 26.1
This progressive decline in women's influence as the higher
levels of leadership are reached is not only noticeable in the
structure of the State and its political organs, but is also
to be found in the government service, the political parties,
the trade unions, private businesses, etc. Nor do there seem
to be any signs of improvement. Although the difference in
the proportions of men and women non-voters sometimes
tends to lessen in certain countries, nothing similar can be
noted at the parliamentary and governmental levels. The
percentage of women members of parliament, for instance, is
hardly increasing. On the contrary, it tends to fall after the
first elections in which women have had the suffrage, and
to become stabilized at a very low level.
Though the part played by women in political
leadership is small it has a special qualitative (Cont'd on
bias. Here there is a fairly sharp difference in page 24.)

GERMANY (1). German women received the right to
vote in 1919. Under the 1949 Fundamental Law of the
Federal Republic of Germany and under the Constitution
of the Democratic Republic of Germany, promulgated in
the same year, women vote and are elected on an equal
basis with men and have the same right as men to hold
public office.
AUSTRALIA (2). In 1894, South Australia granted
women the right to vote ; five years later West Australia
did the same and by 1908 all the states had given equal
voting rights. In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act
provided for a uniform federal franchise for the Common¬
wealth Parliament for all men and women over 21.
BELGIUM (3). Full voting rights were granted to Bel¬
gian women in 1948. Since 1921 they had only had the
right to vote in local elections, with the exception of cer¬
tain women wives, or failing them, mothers of men who
had lost their lives during the First World War, or women
who had been imprisoned by the enemy army who were
given the right to vote in national elections.
BRAZIL (4). In Brazil voting is compulsory for all
men and women with the exception of infirm people and
those aged over 70.
CEYLON (5). Women were enfranchised in Ceylon in
1931, but their qualifying age was 30 as compared with 21
for men. This inequality was removed in 1934, and by
1946, two years before Ceylon achieved independence, uni¬
versality of suffrage and eligibility to public office were
established on an equal basis for men and women.
CHILE (6). The right to vote in local elections was
granted to Chilean women in 1931, providing they were
literate, aged over 25, and had either property on which
they paid taxes or followed a business or industrial pro
fession. In 1934 they were allowed to vote on equal terms
with men in local elections, and in 1949 were granted
suffrage in national elections.
GUATEMALA (7). Illiterate women may not vote, and
voting for literate women is voluntary. Men, whether
literate or illiterate, may vote; for literate men, voting is
compulsory, for the illiterate, it is voluntary.
HAITI (8). Under the Constitution of 1950 women
were restricted to voting in municipal elections until 1954.
All disabilities will have been removed by 1957 and women
will then have complete political rights.
ICELAND (9). When Denmark enfranchised women in
1915, Iceland was under Danish rule and the right to vote
was extended to Icelandic women. In 1944 when Iceland
severed its ties with the Danish Crown, women retained
the right to vote under its new Republican Constitution.
But to qualify as voters both men and women must be
"of unblemished character and financially solvent".
LEBANON (10). To be eligible to vote a woman must
have a certificate of primary education or its equivalent.
MONACO (11). In Monaco, women have had the right
to vote for and be elected to the Communal Council on
the same conditions as men since 1945.
PORTUGAL (12). Women's voting rights are subject
to special educational or tax qualifications. Women who
are heads of families may vote if they pay not less than
100 escudos in taxes a year. Other women must either
have completed a course in general studies in a secondary
school, or taken a course in teaching or in an industrial or
commercial institute, or studied fine arts or music, before
they are eligible to vote.
SYRIA (13). Women over 18 years of age and possess¬
ing a certificate of at least primary education have had
the right to vote since September 1949.

behaviour between the sexes. In party. leadership, in senior
administrative posts, in parliaments and in governments, the
few women included concentrate on specialized matters, such
as health, education, motherhood, family welfare, housing,
etc.. on all problems which are generally considered to be
of special interest to women.
It might be thought that this specialization is chiefly
characteristic of the first phase in women's participation in
political life, and that it will progressively diminish. But
facts contradict this optimistic conclusion. So far, there are
signs, on the contrary, of a very definite increase of this
tendency towards specialization.
Nothing demonstrates this trend more clearly than the
history of the parties of the Left and the extreme Left as
regards this problem. At the beginning of the century, they
were vehemently against any sex discrimination and attempt¬
ed to give women and men strict equality in political life.
Today, although they have not directly renounced their ori¬
ginal doctrine, they stress women's role as wives and mothers
and make their women leaders responsible for directing
activities for women as such, developing housewives leagues,
or mothers' associations, in preference to encouraging women
to join the parties themselves.
First to lose jobs in a slump
The feminism of 1954 is not the same as that of 1900.
In 1900, it refused to admit any distinction between
the sexes and treated both men and women as citizens.
But in 1954, it bases its doctrine on the differences between
the sexes and encourages women to enter political life for the
defence of interests which are considered to be their special
concern.
The small influence of women in the real leadership of
States i.e. in the elaboration and application of political
decisions, seems attributable, in the first instance, to male
opposition. This opposition was already vigorous with regard
to the suffrage. It is symptomatic that the right to vote has
seldom been granted to women by a parliamentary decision,
but has usually resulted from a revolution and the decision
of a provisional government which had not been elected.
In point of fact, this is true of three out of the four coun¬
tries investigated Germany, France and Yugoslavia. Only
in Norway was woman's suffrage introduced by the ordinary
democratic processes. Nevertheless, men's opposition gra¬
dually abated as the results of women's suffrage showed how
little it had changed the earlier situation. At the govern¬
mental level, on the other hand, this opposition is still ex¬
tremely strong, since a strong feeling of competition exists.
This seems to be a general tendency. As soon as there
is a serious threat of unemployment in a trade or profession
where the two sexes have previously been on an equal footing,
women are the first to suffer, either by being the first effected
by staff reductions or by discrimination in regard to wages,
or by simply finding it impossible to obtain employment. The
equality between men and women as regards gainful
employment, seldom perfect, deteriorates as. soon as compe¬
tition becomes keener.
Now, there has always been extremely keen competition
for political leadership. In the choice of a local party leader
from among the members, of a candidate for election among
the party leaders, or of a minister or a member of a parlia¬
mentary committee from among the members of parliament,
the rivalry is intense. To give a post to a woman is to
deprive a man of it and, in these circumstances, the posts
given to women are cut down to the minimum required for
propaganda purposes.
All the evidence collected on this point in the various coun¬
tries is in agreement. In the realm of politics, the "promo¬
tion of women" comes up against a barrier of male opposi¬
tion. The official statements made at the last congress of
the Yugoslav Communist League bear out the complaints
formulated by French and German women members of par¬
liament and of political parties.
But the free access of women to education and higher
education and their success in various careers makes it dif¬
ficult to maintain that they are by nature incapable of
managing public affairs efficiently. Besides, as has often been
observed, the results of men's management have not been
so brilliant in this field that the male sex can boast of its
proven capability. Although the old argument of woman's
mental incapacity is losing ground, it is being very success¬
fully replaced by a new form of justification which might
be called the functional theory.
In this, no attempt is made to maintain inequality bet¬
ween man and woman and the superiority of the former,
but the object is to establish a kind of division of labour,
24

Unesco Courier. Nr H. 1955
based on a difference of aptitudes. The slogan "woman's
place is in the home" is simply the extreme conservative form
of a subtler and less uncompromising line of reasoning. More
advanced exponents of the functional theory recognize the
right of women to work outside the home and to take a part
in civic and social life and in political affairs, but only on
condition that they confine their activities to problems of
motherhood, education, and the family to what might be
termed "'home policy". In this way they make the best of a
bad job, whilst at the same time limiting the damages.
However subtle their arguments in justification, men's
opposition to the participation of women in political life
would not have succeeded so well if it had come up against
vigorous resistance from women. But, in general, such resist¬
ance is weak and is conducted, in the main, by small isolat¬
ed minority groups which have no chance of securing results.
It must be acknowledged that the small influence of women
in State leadership is largely due to women's own inertia.
They don't want to be leaders
There can be no denying that women are less interested
in politics than men. In the IFOP (1) investigation
conducted in June 1953, less than two months after the
municipal elections, two out of three men (60 per cent) said
that they had been interested in the results for the whole
country, as against one woman out of three (34 per cent).
Roughly the same proportion (70 per cent of men and 35 per
cent of women) answered the following question in the affir¬
mative. "Do you ever discuss politics with people you know
well?". The answers to the next question "Do you ever
discuss politics with people you know little or not at all?" are
still more significant, for 30 per cent of the men answered
"yes" as against 10 per cent of the women. To the direct
question "Are you interested in politics" the answers were as
follows: Men. "Yes", 36 per cent; "slightly". 36 per cent;
"No", 28 per cent. Women. "Yes", 13 per cent; "slightly",
27 per cent; "No", 60 per cent.
As it was, this referred only to a vague general interest
in "politics" as a whole. When we come to consider active
participation in political life and the possibility of standing
as candidates, women's attitude is the same 46 per cent
of the women questioned by the IFOP thought that a woman
ought,not to stand for the municipal elections (the least poli¬
tical of all) but only 14 per cent expressed the same dis¬
approval in the case of a man candidate.
Not only do women show little desire to win a place in
political leadership, but the great majority of them accept
the system of justification invented by men to rationalize
their standing aside from it. Curiously, they sometimes
seem to be more uncompromising than men in this regard,
and more anti-feminist. Consider the following results of
the IFOP survey. The persons questioned were given a list
of activities ranging from the simple reading of political
news to standing for election or campaigning actively for a
political party. They were asked if there were any activities
on this list which seemed to them unsuitable for members
of their own or the opposite sex. The answers were as
follows:

The change in the attitude of the left-wing parties
towards women is probably linked with the realization of
this fundamental fact. When they championed the argu¬
ments of traditional feminism, of the absolute equality of
men and women, of their identical part in political life as
citizens, they were not followed by the female public any
more than by the male public. It is significant from this
point of view that the only mass movements which attract
women are para-political organizations such as the Union des
Femmes françaises and the Ligue Féminine d'Action Catho¬
lique, which have specifically "feminine" objects and specia
lized interests and which do not openly admit their political
connexions and their political interests.
It may be that the change in the policy of certain left-
wing parties in this field is purely a matter of tactics and
does not compromise their long-term strategy, which is
designed to establish real equality between the sexes; none
the less, the change is important in analysing the present
opinions of women with regard to their role in political life.
We still have to determine on what grounds these opinions
are based. Why do women agree to specialize in family,
household and educational matters, while admitting that
men can do anything? Why are not women feminists, or not
more so? There is a large measure of truth in the economic
explanation advanced by some people.
Women are intensely conscious of the wife's economic
dependence on the husband. To some extent, moreover, this
feeling develops simultaneously with the increase in the
number of women earning their own living. When very few
women had their own income, those who remained at home
felt that their position was natural and inevitable, in accord¬
ance with the natural order of things, unquestioned and
unquestionable. Today, some women are developing an
inferiority complex in this respect, often enough kept in
being by the husband ("I earn OUR living" is a typical retort
in family arguments).
In point of fact, the economic factor ought not to be consi¬
dered in isolation. Whether a woman has a career or not,
whether she earns her own living or not, she has a place in
a general social structure (in which economic factors, inci¬
dentally, play an essential part). It is in the general struc¬
ture of society, in the psychological and social environment,
that the fundamental explanation of women's behaviour
should probably be sought. The laws establishing the civic
equality of men and women are in advance of the customs of
society. In spite of thé far-reaching changes of the last
half-century, western civilizations are still based
on the pre-eminence of the man. (Cont'd on

From here and there
IN LAW AND GOVERNMENT
Recent advances made by women in the fields of
politics and the law include the following: seven
women senators and twenty-four women deputies in
Argentina; two women deputies in Brazil; three in
Costa Rica; three senators and two deputies in the
Dominican Republic; three women mayors in Haiti;
a woman senator and sixteen women representatives
in the United States Congress; ten deputies in Vene¬
zuela; two in Colombia. In Switzerland, where
women do not yet have the vote, the Canton of
Basle recently granted women the right to be
appointed judges and assessors. In Turkey, two
women have been appointed to the Supreme Court
and the Philippine Government has appointed three
women district court judges.
WOMEN AT THE U.N.:
Seventeen nations include women as members of
their permanent missions to the United Nations.
Among them are Mrs. Nonny M. Wright, economist
and Counsellor to the Danish Mission, who has been
in the U.N. Economic and Social Council since 1947;
Miss Uldarica Manas, writer and member of Cuba's
foreign service since 1937, who has represented Cuba
at the U.N. since 1946, and Mrs. Zena Harman, social
affairs adviser and alternate representative on the
Israel Delegation.
A NEW MILESTONE:
Adoption of the Convention on the Political Rights
of Women by the U.N. General Assembly in 1952 was
a new milestone in women's advance towards equal
political rights with men. So far forty States have
signed the Convention; twenty-two have so far ra¬
tified or acceded to it. Altogether, women enjoy
equal voting rights in sixty-two countries.
SUCCESS IN BRITAIN:
The first move in a campaign for votes for women
in Britain which lasted 51 years was taken in 1867
with the founding of the London National Society
for Women's Suffrage. Today British women voters
outnumber men. There are one and three quarter
million women in the trade unions, and women sit
on the Council of the Trade Union Congress. The
first Women's Institute in Britain was founded in
1917. There are now over 8,000 two for every
three villages in the country.
INDIA'S CIVIL SERVANTS:
The total of 20,688 women now employed in Indian
Government Departments is made up as follows:
Ministry of Communications, 8,800; Defence, 3,000;
Production, 1,072; Food and Agriculture, 206; Exter¬
nal Affairs, 701; Information and Broadcasting, 225;
Other ministries, 6.684.
EQUAL VOTING IN THE U.S.S.R.:
After the revolution of 1917, a decree of the Provi¬
sional Government issued in the autumn of that
year granted women the right to vote. The follow¬
ing year the All-Russian Congress of Soviets adopt¬
ed a constitution granting women of 18 and over
voting rights, and the right to hold public office on
an equal basis with men. The 1936 constitution
proclaimed equal rights for men and women.
THEY SIGNED THE CHARTER:
Ten years ago in San Francisco four women
representing their countries affixed their signatures
to the Charter of the United Nations. They were
Miss Minerva Bernadino for the Dominican Republic,
Dr. Virginia C. Gildersleeve for the U.S.A., Dr. Ber¬
tha Lutz for Brazil and Dr. Wu Yi-fang for China.
WOMEN IN POLITICS (Continued)
to political careers, it is because everything tends to turn
them away from them; if they allow politics to remain essen¬
tially a man's business, it is because everything conduces to
this belief, tradition, family life, education; religion and
literature. From birth, women are involved in a system which
tends to make them think of themselves as feminine.
Besides her specialization in the tasks of mother, wife and
housewife, her introverted attitude towards the home, that
closed world which should absorb all her energies and all her
dreams, a woman also has a feeling of dépendance on man.
This is perhaps the fundamental obstacle to her playing a full
part in political life. Under a democratic system, political
activity is essentially adult. It presupposes that anyone en¬
gaging in it takes full responsibility for his fate and does not
leave it to another to decide for him. It is diametrically
opposed to any form of paternalism in social relations. But,
while women have, legally, ceased to be minors, they still have
the mentality of minors in many fields and, particularly in
politics, they usually accept paternalism on the part of men.
The man husband, fiancé, lover or myth is the mediator
between them and the political world. "When things go
wrong, women blame their husbands, men blame the govern¬
ment" is a fairly apt summing up of this basic attitude.
The French reporter's analysis of sentimental women's
magazines (la presse du c shows up all its implications.
Faced with the same basic set of circumstances an inferior
social and economic position, leading to a sense of deprivation

and frustration and a feeling of belonging to a "proletariat",
young men tend to turn towards the revolutionary parties or
the trade unions, young women towards the expectation of a
rich and handsome "prince charming", who will deliver them
from the poverty and ugliness of their everyday world.
It is therefore useless to seek to give women a larger part in
political life by special reforms in this particular field. The
small part played by women in politics merely reflects and
results from the secondary place to which they are still
assigned by the customs and attitudes of our society and
which their education and training tend to make them accept
as the natural order of things. Purely political reforms are
effective here only so far as they tend gradually to modify
this situation, to counteract the effects of habit and tradition,
to help women to free themselves from them, and to awaken
them to a sense of their own independence.
From this point of view, woman's suffrage is probably a
most important reform; if its short-term political results are
small, its long-term educational value seems to be great. It
is probably still more important to fight against the deeply-
rooted belief in the natural inferiority of women, based on
physiological or psycho-physiological considerations a par¬
ticularly serious obstacle because women feel deeply the
special characteristics of their sex in this respect.
All the efforts of mankind are, in fact, directed to overcom¬
ing inequalities deriving from differences in natural condi¬
tions. From this point of view, those deriving from sex are
no more important than those resulting from climate, soil
composition or difficulties of communications. There is no
more an inferior sex than there are inferior races or inferior
classes. But there is a sex, and there are classes and races,
who have come to believe in their inferiority because they
have been persuaded of it in justification of their subordinate
position in society.

SPORTSWOMEN
OF THE WORLD
In almost all branches of sport women
are now playing an increasingly
important role. Here, some sports¬
women from East and West de¬
monstrate their prowess.
CUSTOM
VERSUS
THE LAW
r ry-1 ORTY-FOUR women students of
H Jokakou University were ad-
A monished by the head of the
university for having had their hair
permanently waved." This minor news
item which appeared in a Japanese
newspaper is surprising for two rea¬
sons: Japan is one of the countries
where the fight for women's rights has
28
met with the least resistance; the uni¬
versity in question was one of the first
to open its doors to women back in
1906.
The exact reason for the rebuke is
of less importance than the incident
itself, for here is one more proof that
the customs of society evolve more
slowly than the minds of lawmakers.
The great spiritual and moral malaise
which afflicts much of mankind owes
a great deal to the fact that our moral
conceptions and sentiments are still
anchored in the past and have little
in common with our own times. Cus¬
toms have not kept pace with the
changes imposed by technical progress.
A Japanese professor who tells his
women students about the most recent
discoveries in biology, and explains
the various organic functions of the
human body, is shocked because these
young women come to lectures with
their hair permanently waved. It would
not have been allowed "in his time".
He drives a car, travels by plane and
breathes the air of the 1950s but "his
time" dates back some 30 years.
How many others are there just like
him? The member of parliament who,
in the morning supports a new di¬
vorce law granting greater rights to
women, may be outraged in the after¬
noon when he learns that his son loves
and wants to marry a divorced woman.
Civil Codes and laws may give a
woman the right to do many things,
but if she actually does them she may
find herself criticized and condemned.
She must always be on her guard
against the pitfalls opened by the gap
which exists today between customs
and rights.
The ethical principles which govern
the social behaviour of almost all peo¬
ples are nearly always religious in
origin. That is why religion has always
played an important role in family
organization and has determined the
place of the wife. The family, as the
basic unit of society, was established
on the principle of monogamy. For far
too long it has been asserted incorrect¬
ly that human beings are polygamous
by nature. Recent studies by anthro¬
pologists have shown quite clearly that
the reverse is true.
Queen with 400 'husbands'
Polygamy only appeared at .an
advanced stage of social evolu¬
tion. In patriarchial communi¬
ties where polygamy is practised, a
man has the right to several wives,
just as, in a matriarchy where polyan¬
dry is customary, it is the woman who
can have a harem. Kahena, Queen of
a Berber tribe in the Atlas Mountains,
who resisted Islam and the Arab in¬
vaders, had 400 "husbands". In Ruan-
da-Urundi in the Belgian Congo, there
is a tribe whose female chief has a
harem of something like 200 men. And
in the ancient world of the Middle
East there were peoples whose customs
required several brothers to marry the
same woman. Jealousy seems to be
one of the fruits of civilization.
Because the family is itself a commu¬
nity it must have a head. Should this
be the husband or the wife? As the
question is not one of rights but rather
of conventions, it cannot be settled by
law. Such conventions may have an
internal family character and be quite
independent of customs. Although in
past times the support of the family
depended entirely on the efforts of the
husband, and the wife concerned her¬
self solely with household tasks, the
man did not always demand the rights
of family head within his own home.

In China, until the Kuomintang
came to power, women had practically
no legal rights but they took the ini¬
tiative in the private affairs of their
family. They decided how the chil¬
dren should be educated, what callings
their sons should follow and even whom
they should marry. In Asia and in
Africa some tribes consider women as
guardians of the line of family descent
which, therefore, takes the woman's
name, not the husband's.
Despite her emancipation a woman
fills different roles from a man both
in the community and the family.
Equality of rights ought not to lead to
the foolish idea that women should
live and behave like men. While en¬
joying the same rights men and women
have their own places in life and are
faced with different jobs and respon¬
sibilities.
Sometimes society itself encourages
a woman to develop an absurd idea
about her role in life. Look how many
people there are who quite wrongly
think that the work done by a woman
in her home is of less value than that
done by her husband in an office or
a factory. A woman who looks after
her home properly and brings up her
children to be honest, law-abiding citi¬
zens has just as much reason to be
proud as a skilled surgeon who success¬
fully carries out a difficult operation.
But it would be just as wrong to
consider sewing on buttons or darning
stockings as the ideal role for a woman.
This brings to mind the case of the
husband in the United States whose
wife decided that she wished to conti¬
nue her education at a university. He
forbade his wife to attend the univer¬
sity lectures and told her to spend more
time mending his shirts and socks. The
wife finally took her case to court
which recognized her right to follow
any studies she wished and ordered her
husband to pay for this education.
The nationality of married women is
one of the problems with which legis¬
lators are working at present. Should
the woman who marries a foreigner
have the right to retain her own nation¬
ality or should she be obliged to adopt
that of her husband?
There are two main points of view
on this question. The first is based on
the principle of legal equality between
the sexes. If a woman is recognized as
being the equal of a man in all ques¬
tions of rights, she can hardly be forc¬
ed to renounce her nationality simply
Decause she marries a foreigner. This
principle has been accepted by most
countries.
Are men really unhappy ?
The second argument takes as its
basis the need for family unity.
Those who support it claim that
the moral and spiritual unity of the
family is threatened if the parents and
children are not of the same nation¬
ality. Complications may arise not only
through purely administrative ques¬
tions, but also because of political
events which may divide the members
of the family. India and Egypt are
two countries which support this prin¬
ciple and believe that in all cases a
woman should adopt her husband's
nationality.
The laws which govern this question
vary widely from country to country,
and an international convention bring¬
ing some order into the matter would
be of great benefit. For several years
prior to the Second World War. the
League of Nations tried to draw up
such a convention. Several countries
have since revised their laws, but there
are so many complications involved
that jurists working on the problem
find themselves in a maze of par¬
agraphs with fine shades of meaning.
Today the United Nations is working on
the question and a draft convention is
now before the General Assembly.
But even in law the equality of the
two sexes can never be complete. A
woman's physical capacities must be
taken into account. Sometimes she
obtains advantages from them. For
example, in thirty-three countries the
legal minimum age for marriage is
lower for women than for men. In
nine States of the U.S.A. girls reach
their majority at the age of 18, but
young men do so only at 21.
In sport a woman's abilities are go¬
verned by her physical capacities. It
is interesting to compare the relative
athletic records achieved by men and
women. The fastest woman sprinter in
the world is Mrs. Blankers-Koen of
Holland, who ran 100 metres in 11,5
seconds; the male record is 10.2 se¬
conds. A Russian woman, Mrs Pletnova
ran 800 metres in two minutes eight
and a half seconds; the German male
record holder took 25 seconds less to
run the same distance. The record
high jump for a woman is 172 centime¬
tres; the male record is 211 centimetres.
In swimming, the best time for 100 me¬
tres achieved by a man is nine seconds
less than the woman's record. Few,
if any, women have distinguished
themselves behind the wheel of a rac¬
ing car, although there are many who
have become world-famous pilots.
But are men really more unhappy
because their womenfolk have come
out of the home in order to add their
energies to those forces which deter¬
mine the progress of the world? Cer¬
tainly not!

SOCIETY - EXPLODING

Outward appearances often
give travellers a false impres¬
sion that women in primitive
societies are nothing but drud¬
ges and inferior beings. A
closer look at the true meaning
of certain customs shows that

Unesco Courier. N' 11. 1955
Are women in "primitive" societies the drudges and
inferior beings often described by writers of the last
century? Many people still think, they are, for the
picture drawn by so many travellers, of the native woman
bent under the weight of a heavy burden, clutching a child
to her breast, while her husband walks lightheartedly ahead,
bow in hand, has become accepted as the symbol of the
degradation of women in "savage" communities.
It is also true that for some time an entirely opposite idea
has persisted concerning a primitive matriarchy. Many
historians assumed its existence, traces of which could be
found among "savage" tribes, and great efforts were made
to seek facts which would point to a phase in human
development when women ruled over men.
Such ideas as these are apt to distort our judgment just
when the so-called "primitive" peoples have ceased to belong
to a distant world and are beginning to play a direct part in
our own civilization. If we are to help them adapt
themselves to this change we should not add to a somewhat
condescending pity for their unperfected techniques, a
disdain for customs we simply do not understand. Of course,
innumerable studies have been written about this vast
subject, and all I can hope to do here is to clear up a few
points about which there are the most mistaken ideas.
Before conclusions can be drawn about the status of women
in any particular community it must be considered against
each different aspect of the culture. Even in a civilization
like our own where equality of the sexes is often given legal
recognition and where, economically and socially, women are
playing an increasingly important role, there are some insti¬
tutions in which they are given only a subordinate and
insignificant place.
Female shock troops
sent heads flying
In religion, for instance, a sphere in which women are
noted for their piety and zeal, the priesthood is barred to
them, and with it the entire ecclesiastical hierarchy.
The idea of a woman as a bishop or a Chief Rabbi seems
slightly comic, if not sacrilegious and shocking.
That women should be handicapped in this respect might
well surprise members of other civilizations where it is
precisely women who are chosen as mediators between men
and the spirit world. It is their privilege to receive revela¬
tions, and to invoke the spirits, to appease their wrath or
obtain their favours. Men, even those most highly placed in
the social hierarchy, listen to them and ask their advice on
everything relating to the supernatural.
This is particularly the case among tribes practising
Shamanism, where women monopolize religious life, and are
thought to be specially gifted for maintaining regular contact
with spirits. Amongst the Araucanian Indians in Chile, a
once great and virile tribe, men who felt drawn towards
magic or the priesthood dressed as women and tried to look
like them in every way. In North America, the ceremonial
life of the famous Iroquois tribe of New York State was very
largely controlled by its women.
It is a sad reflection on our own times that women have
been so associated with military life. Generally speaking, and
despite legends about the Amazons, most "primitive" peoples
considered women unfit for warfare, though the story of the
women's regiments of Dahomey, in Africa, throws doubt on
the physical and physiological reasons usually given to justi¬
fy the exclusion of women from fighting. The Dahomey
Dr. Alfred METRAUX was only 27 when he made his first expedition, an archaeo¬
logical study in Latin America. Since then, his career as a practising anthropologist
has taken him oyer most of Latin America and the South Sea Islands. He has
conducted several missions for Unesco and as a member of Unesco's staff is associated
with its campaign against racial discrimination. Swiss born. Dr. Metraux is
now a citizen of the United States. He has written numerous studies on tribes of
South America and the Pacific.
shock troops were made up entirely of young women, who, in
theory, passed for the ruler's wives. During battles or sieges,
they were held in reserve until the chief warrior decided that
the moment had come to snatch a decisive victory by throw¬
ing his best troops into the fray. The women hurled
themselves upon the enemy, brandishing enormous scimitars
with which they sent heads flying in all directions. To these
formidable Amazons fell the task of defending the indepen¬
dence of Behanzin's Kingdom when Dahomey was conquered
by French troops some fifty years ago.
Power-wielding matrons
of the Iroquois tribe
The worst mistakes that have been made in assessing the
true status of "primitive woman" have generally been
caused by confusion between legal status and actual
status. By placing the emphasis solely on the authority of
the husband, and in particular on such customs as the pur¬
chase of wives, a very grim picture can be painted of the life
of women in "savage" communities. But when we take a
closer look at the behaviour of both sexes and discover the
true meaning of certain customs, we soon realize that the
inequality between men and women is not early as great as
it looks. In fact according to the angle from which we con¬
sider the problem, disadvantages are counterbalanced by
privileges that are often of great importance.
The famous American ethnographer and sociologist,
Dr. Robert H. Lowie was not merely indulging in a witty
paradox when he wrote, in his treatise on primitive sociology :
"George Eliot and Madame Récamier, in spite of their social
influence, did not even remotely approach the legal position
of the average Iroquois matron". He could not have chosen
a better example, for there are few communities in which
women wielded such power as did the matrons of this Red
Indian tribe. They had no place in the council of the tribe
nor in the council of the great Iroquois League, but they
nominated their members. Political authority rested on their
choice and they had the additional power of deposing chiefs
whom they deemed unequal to their task.
The role of women in political affairs brings us back to
the problem of matriarchy. The existence of a social order
where women ruled over men has been relegated to the realm
of mythology. With the exception of the Iroquois, and a very
few other tribes, it is only by accident that women have
wielded political power.
Unsatisfactory husbands are
turned out of the hut
The idea of primitive matriarchy arises out of a confusion
between matrilineal descent and female rule. The fact
that a person belpngs to his mother's clan, inherits
from his maternal uncle and looks upon the members of his
father's clan as strangers, does not mean that women enjoy
a privileged position. In a great many "primitive" commun¬
ities, the husband is obliged by custom to live at his wife's
home; but although this state of affairs may be advantageous
to the wife, it does not imply any superiority of the female
sex, though of course the woman who stays with her family
does not run the risk of being ill-treated by her husband,
since any injustice or brutality on his part would soon bring
upon him the wrath of the whole household.
Amongst the Pueblo Indians in the south-west United
States, the women own the family hut, and can drive out
husbands who no longer please them. It is not ,,-,---,,-' ,r
surprising that the men are ill at ease JConl'd on .

they can count on the affection and trust of their relations.
Some anthropologists have tried to correlate the economy
of a given community with the status of its women. Indeed,
amongst a number of so-called "primitive" peoples, soil culti¬
vation is left entirely to the women. In the Amazon region,
for instance, the men simply clear the land, and all the rest
of the agricultural labour is provided by the women. It is
they who plant, harvest and carry the crops. As basic food
supplies depend on agriculture, it is reasonable to suppose
that women occupy a strong position in the life of the tribe.
Conversely in communities which depend for their livelihood
on hunting and fishing, the status of women might be
expected to show their dependence on the men. Once again,
however, facts disprove theory.
In some communities of nomad hunters, the sexes have
more or less equal rights, whereas in other groups, woman
occupies a decidedly inferior position, even though she is the
chief provider of food. From these examples, therefore, it
cannot be said that economic development necessarily pro-
32
duces any change in the status of women. There does, how¬
ever, appear to be a close connexion between the raising of
livestock and the relegation of women to a position of
inferiority.
The subordination of women and the very minor role they
were given outside the home in early European and Asiatic
communities is ascribed to the influence of the nomad
herdsmen. Is there a cause and effect relationship between
stock-raising a masculine activityand female inferiority?
Some people have thought so, but anthropologists see in this
relationship the effect of a historical accident, and cite the
case of pastoral tribes like the Hottentots, who do not treat
women as inferior beings.
The argument most often used to demonstrate the infer¬
iority of "primitive" woman, is that in many communities
particularly in Africawomen are bought by their future
husbands. Much has been written both to protest against
this custom, and to defend it and explain its significance.
The purchase of women in East Africa, for example the

looola as it is called generally takes the form of the delivery
to the girl's family of so many head of cattle. To acquire
enough head of cattle to be able to marry is the main concern
of the young men of many tribes. It is not a mere commer¬
cial transaction, but something much more complicated. In
the first place, the handing over of the cattle gives official
sanction to the marriage; it is the equivalent of a marriage
contract in societies like our own, and the woman for whom
no cattle had changed hands would not feel that her marriage
was valid.
The young man's family, on the other hand, is not purchas¬
ing the woman herself, but a proprietary right over her issue.
If no "'payment" had been made, the children of the marriage
would belong to the wife's family. The cattle therefore
represent a form of marriage settlement paid by the husband
to his future bride's parents, to be administered by them on
her behalf and that of her children. Sometimes if the wife
dies childless, the cattle must be returned to the husband.
In short, in the transaction wrongly known as bride-purchase,
the legal aspect is more important than the economic. It is
not a "business deal", but a solemn act giving legal sanction
to the marriage and ensuring the legitimacy of the offspring.
In attempting to clarify these points, I have merely tried to
render justice to peoples commonly called "'primitive" or
"inferior". In spite of our enormous technical progress, we
ourselves find it difficult to throw off customs inherited from
our Indo-European forefathers those nomad herdsmen who
showed so little indulgence towards the other sex. The
attainment of rights for women often does no .more than
introduce into our civilization a state of affairs in fact and
in law, which has existed for centuries and even for thousands
of years amongst peoples we are too often apt to despise.

THE HAND THAT ROCKS
THE CRADLE...
by Lucienne Nobiet
Traditional ideas die hard. Eight men out of ten, if
asked the not-so-simple question "Does your wife
work?" rarely hesitate to reply: "'My wife? She doesn't
do anything... She stays at home."
Most men take it pretty much for granted that the ordinary
housewife has the luck to lead a privileged life of ease, with
plenty of free time on her hands during the day. He is
blissfully unaware of how much time really goes into the
care of the home, cooking
meals and looking after
children.
Just recently social re¬
search experts in the U.S.A.,
Gt. Britain, Belgium and
France added up. what they
thought was the real value
of work done by house¬
wives. First of all they
found that the wife who
"doesn't do anything" pro¬
vides the country with more
than a bit of all it's money.
The experts use the term
"quite a considerable part
of its national income".
They also found out that
the figures for the four
countries were all much
about the same, and if the
four sets of figures were
put together the stay-at-
home wives were handling
and administering some
60 % of all the money in
the country. So it looks
after all as if the mother
in the home is, perhaps,
just as much a financial
wizard as any Wall Street
tycoon.
The French survey, carried out by the National Institute
of Demographic Studies, got some interesting facts to show
that a woman's work is never done. They found that the
average French housewife in the large towns, such as Paris,
Lyons and Marseilles, works a 70-hour week. They took
this figure and put it against the total number of households
in France (13 million). The surprising result was that
housewives were found to work some four thousand million
hours more than all the other kinds of workers in the
country, both men and women. This means that looking
after French homes and children takes quite a bit more time
that the whole of French business, industry, agriculture and
administration. Here once again the figures for the U.S.A.,
the U.K. and Belgium were much the same.
These facts and figures are not, perhaps, so surprising if
we take a look at some of the replies given by French
housewives in another survey carried out by the International
Association of Women Doctors, aimed at determining the
extent to which housewives overwork. Most wives with
children to look after put in between 10 and 14 hours work a
day, and only those with grown-up families said that they
did less than 8 hours a day.
Asked whether they had a complete day's break in their
working week, most replied '"No" or "Rarely", while some
admitted to a half-day on Sunday. As for holidays the
majority said that they never had any real holidays as
34
more often than not they had to carry on with their normal
household chores in conditions which were sometimes worse
than in their own homes. One mother with six children gave
the shocking reply that her only holidays consisted of the
eleven-day periods when she was bearing her children.
All-in-all the surveys revealed that about three-quarters of
housewives do not have a proper holiday. Some of the
reasons given by French housewives for the causes of fatigue
and illness were: looking
after children; noise; lack
of time for rest and sleep;
monotony of work; solitude.
Going with these is the
sense of inferiority with
regard to their work which
is not appreciated in the
way it should be.
But this sense of inferio¬
rity is now on the way to
being overcome, and Go¬
vernments in the U.K.,
Ireland and Western Ger¬
many, to take only three
examples, have now re¬
cognized that women's
work in the home is
just as important as any
other kind of "professional"
work, and "without it, the
nation could not survive."
Particularly important is
the mother's role in the
training and education of
her children. Here, her
guidance and help are
practically irreplaceable.
To take the words of the
French enquiry "Every child
needs the warm affection
of its mother, or of
someone capable of replacing her permanently. If that need
is not met, the psychological injury inflicted will have deep
repercussions in later life."
But, if the real Worth of woman's Iwork in the home is now
being appreciated, little attention has been given to her
status as a housewife. She has been called "'irreplaceable",
but up to now she has not had a chance to benefit from the
tremendous improvement in labour conditions. Not for her
the five-day-week, holidays with pay and retirement on '
pension. In official eyes she still counts for little.
Can anything be done about this? Certainly the first
thing which comes to mind is the need for more domestic
help. Although it is true that this is fast disappearing in
most countries of the world, nevertheless some positive steps
could be taken along other lines.
For example, the French Association of Women Doctors has
suggested that laundry services could be improved, the
number of mothers-aid workers increased, family holiday
centres established and domestic science courses made more
easily available..
Here are some concrete proposals which could help in giving
the housewife greater liberty, and more time to devote herself
to outside interests, and to the training and education of her
children.

THE VANISHING VEIL
A challenge to the old order
by A. H. Hourani
Most Arabs are Moslems, and for
over a thousand years their
social life has been governed
by the Law of Islam. Therefore, if we
wish to know what the Lie of Arab
women was, and to some extent still
is, we must first of all ask what Islamic
law says it ought to be.
Islam allows polygamy : those who
know nothing else about Islam know
this, although they may not be aware
of the limits placed upon polygamy a
man may have no more than four
wives, and only on condition that he
treats all of them justly. Islam allows
easy divorce too, and in practice it has
always been much easier for men to
divorce their wives than for women to
divorce their husbands. But on the
other hand married women are given
the right to own property and to be
maintained if they are divorced; and
women have the right to inherit,
although within limits a sister re¬
ceives only half as much as her brother
from their father's estate.
Law is not the only force which
moulds society; the Arab community
has been influenced too by social
customs which are not Moslem in
origin, although they have been
widespread in Moslem countries. By
tradition Moslem women are secluded:
hidden in the harem when at home,
behind the veil when they go out.
But seclusion existed in the Middle
Two years ago Egyptian "suffra¬
gettes" went on hunger strike
in Cairo for ten days (upper
photo) to draw the Govern¬
ment's attention to their de¬
mands for women's rights. Lea¬
der of this Egyptian women's
movement is Miss Dorria Shafik
(being interviewed by journa¬
lists below). The Government
is considering these demands.

East before Islam arose. From the
time of the ancient Kings of Persia,
Eastern rulers have withdrawn them¬
selves and their womenfolk from the
public gaze, to emphasize the majesty
of Kingship. Moslem Caliphs and
Sultans adopted this habit, and what
the rulers did their subjects copied,
particularly the richer population of
the towns. Perhaps there is something
in Islamic conceptions which helped
the spread of this custom; but it is not
essentially nor exclusively Moslem, and
until recently Christian women as well
as Moslems wore the veil in the streets
of Arab towns.
This custom of seclusion, however,
was always held in check by othet
traditions. Social customs among the
Bedouin of the desert are freer than
those of the towns; and in the country¬
side economic necessity made the
woman the companion of her husband's
labour in the fields. Even in the towns
there were women who broke through

THE VANISHING VEIL
(Continued)
Tradition requires that Moslem women go

to learn and to open their eyes to the world

challenged on a large scale. It was
indeed only about fifty years ago that a
writer in Arabic gave the first full
statement on the need and reasons for
a change. He was an Egyptian, Qasim
Amin, who wrote two famous books,
"'The New Woman" and "The Libera¬
tion of Woman". In them he argued
that a gradual and careful change in
the status of women was not contrary
to the principles of Islam.
His ideas met with great opposition
at the time, but in the last fifty years
much of what he suggested has been
carried out, at least in the more
advanced Arab countries Egypt, Syria,
Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq. Even in
countries where the process of social
change has begun more recently, like
the Sudan, it has already influenced
the position of women. It is only in
the countries of the Arabian Peninsula,
Saudi Arabia and Yemen, that the old
order still persists unaltered.
First of all, there has been a change
in the legal position of women. No
Arab State has followed the example
of Turkey and abolished the jurisdiction
of Moslem law in such personal matters
as marriage and divorce; but in some,
36
and notably in Egypt, the law has been
given a new interpretation so as to
bring it more into line with modern
conceptions. For example, two Egyp¬
tian laws, of 1920 and 1929, have made
divorce less difficult, and have given
women the right to obtain a divorce if
their husbands ill-treat them, desert
them or fail to maintain them.
Again, the modern labour codes, like
the Egyptian law of 1933 and the
Lebanese of 1946, contain special regu¬
lations limiting the hours and laying
down the conditions of women's work.
Syria was the first Arab State to give
women the right to vote in elections;
her example has so far been followed
by Lebanon alone, but in Egypt there
is a strong feminist movement, with
Dorria Shafik as its glamorous leader,
and it seems only a matter of time
before women get the vote.
Here once again we should remember
that law is not the whole of life, nor
always its faithful reflection. If we
look beyond law to the life of the Arab
countries as it is actually lived, we
shall find a greater change. Perhaps
the most important sign of it is the
spread of women's education. The
pioneers here were the missionaries,
Catholic and Protestant, who opened
the first schools for girls a century ago.
In the last thirty years modern govern¬
ments in the Arab States have set up
their own systems of schools, for girls
as well as boys. In Egypt, girls account
for 35% of the school-population;
and as the Unesco Courier has re¬
cently told us, in the Arab refugee
schools run by Unesco and UNRWA,
48% of the pupils are girls.
In some Arab countries schools of
every type and at all levels are open
to girls; and in those of the highest
level, the colleges and universities, they-
study side-by-side with men. Un¬
obtrusively, without much publicity,
the Egyptian State Universities, the
French and American Universities in
Beirut, the Syrian University of Da¬
mascus, the higher colleges in Baghdad
have opened their doors to girls.
The Director of the Higher Teachers'
Training college in Baghdad once
explained how this was done. "We
knew", he said, "that to make an
official decision and announce it
publicly would arouse opposition. So
we simply went round to a number of

men whose social position and respec¬
tability were beyond question, and
asked them to send their daughters to
our college. They agreed; their
daughters came to our school, no
announcement was made and there
was no opposition".
As the numbers of educated women
increase, the opportunities for them
to work must be enlarged. Before 1914
they could do little but adopt
the honourable profession of school
teacher. In the 1920's and 1930's
however, girls began to enter offices
as typists and secretaries, and nursing
became respectable for girls of good
family. More recently still they have
begun to find their way into all the
liberal professions.
This spread of education has meant
a change in social life. Educated
women will not accept seclusion, and
educated men want their wives to be
companions. In all except the most
backward regions polygamy has
practically disappeared, and the veil is
rapidly going. It is said that the first
great Egyptian feminist, Huda Sharawi,
solemnly cast her veil into the Medi
terranean as she returned to Egypt in
1923 from a feminist congress in Rome;
her symbolic action was quickly
followed by her fellow-countrywomen,
and within a generation the veil had
disappeared in Egypt except for the
lower middle-class, the most conser¬
vative of all classes. In most other
Arab countries the process took longer
to begin, but developed rapidly.
It would be wrong to talk about
woman's rights without asking what
they have done with them once they
have acquired them. In the Arab
world as elsewhere, women feminists
have demanded freedom not for their
own sake alone, but to be able to play
a part in the life of their peoples. In
the vast changes of the Arab countries
today, women play their full part.
Visitors to Baghdad will know the
beautiful building of the Red Crescent
orphanage, created and maintained by
a group of energetic Iraqi ladies; and
in Egypt the hospitals and social insti¬
tutions of the Mubarrat Muhammad
Ali bear witness to the sense of respon¬
sibility and organizing ability of the
modern Egyptian women. The student
Eric Schwab, Un ited Nations
of Arabic literature and journalism
will know such names as those of
Malak Hifni Nasif, May Ziadeh and
Julia Dimishqiya.
Even in public life, the absence of
the vote has not prevented women
from taking part in the national
movement. Although women do not
yet sit as deputies, they have created
their own public organizations and held
their own conferences, like the Arab
Women's Conference held in Cairo at
the beginning of 1945.
Most important of all, a succession
of distinguished women, beginning
with the famous Princess Nazli of
Egypt, has given political life an am¬
enity which it needs, and which only
women could give; the salon, where
politicians and men of letters and
foreign visitors can meet and talk over
the great issues of the day in an easy,
civilized atmosphere.

ARE WOMEN THE INFERIOR SEX?
(Continued from page 12)
The female is constitutionally stronger than the male, and
what a good thing that this is so, for if men had to give birth
to babies the human race would long have ceased to exist!
Men are muscularly more powerful than women,, but they are
constitutionally weaker. Everywhere with the ^exception of
certain parts of India, where food and sanitation is depres-
singly bad the expectation of life is higher for females than
for males, and this holds true for the greater part of the
animal kingdom
Women are also healthier than men if by health one
means the capacity to deal with germs and illnesses, and they
are more resistant to most diseases and recover from them
more frequently than men.'
There are certain disorders and diseases from which
women suffer more frequently than men, such as gall-bladder
disorders and cancer of the organs serving the functions of
reproduction. Why women suffer more frequently from
disorders of the gall-bladder we do not know, but the repro¬
ductive system cancers we do understand, and it will not be
long before they are greatly reduced. But on the whole, men
suffer more frequently from cancer than women, and from
most other diseases, too.
Girls are mentally two
years ahead of boys
Women are also better shock absorbers than men. They
handle their emotions much more satisfactorily than
men, and are hence more resilient than men. Every¬
where during the last war it was shown that women under
the same siege and occupation, imprisonment and concen¬
tration camp conditions, withstood these conditions very
much better than men.
For every female stutterer there are five males. For every
female colour-blind person there are sixteen males. Bleeders
disease occurs almost exclusively in males. Almost anywhere,
in any country, for every female suicide there are three male
suicides. In almost all hereditary disorders males exceed
females.
Ah, yes, it may be remarked. But what about intelligence?
Intelligence is the mark of the ability to solve problems, to
make the best adjustment to the particular conditions one is
called upon to meet. It has long been known to intelligence-
testers and to school teachers, that on the average, boys are
not as bright as girls. Even baby girls seem to be brighter
than baby boys. Indeed, at five years of age, when most
children enter school in the United States, the girls are
mentally two years ahead of the boys, and what is more,

retain this advantage throughout their school years. If at
college some girls do not do as well as boys, there are always
others that do as well and often better, and we may suspect
that many of the girls who don't do as well are trimming
their sails in order to enter another harbour than that of the
professions, namely, the harbour of marriage and the family.
For this is where the true genius of women lies.
I am convinced that women could achieve everything that
men have achieved in the arts and sciences did they but
apply themselves in the numbers and in the kind of encour¬
aging environments which men have enjoyed, but which
women have seldom enjoyed in anything like such numbers
as men. Women like Marie Curie, Liza Meitner, Gerty Cori,
and Dorothy Needham, not to mention many others, have
already shown what women can accomplish in the sciences
and but a pitifully small proportion of women have applied
themselves to the sciences. It is the same for every other
activity. Where women are afforded the opportunities they
show that they can do at least as well as men, and a good
deal of the time a great deal better!
They must teach men
how to be human
The intelligence that the world stands most in need of at
the present timeindeed, at any timeis the intelli¬
gence with which women are most abundantly equip¬
ped. It is the kind of intelligence which ensures and
conserves life and renders life more abundantly possible. Is
this the .kind of intelligence that men exhibit, or is it the
kind that women exhibit ?
It is to the advantage of everyone to afford women the
opportunities to realize their potentialities to the fullest.
Both men and women should learn to understand the full
significance of the fact that women are largely responsible
for caring for, and moulding the development of, the child.
To bring up a child is the most important task that one
human being can perform for another. Indeed, the future of
mankind may depend upon the manner in which this task is
carried out. This task is no "handicap". It is the greatest
privilege and responsibility ever placed upon the shoulders of
any human being. The manner in which it has been
performed has influenced the whole course of human destiny.
The hand that rocks the cradle is, indeed, the hand that rules
the world.
If the world is not as it should be it is principally the doing
of men who never gave women a chance to serve them in the
manner they are best equipped to do teaching men how to
love their fellow men. It is the function of women to teach
men how to be human.
The best way in which men can help themselves is to help
women realize themselves. In this way both sexes will come
for the first time fully into their own, and share complimen-
tarily with each other what each has creatively to contribute
to the making of a better and happier world.

"Unesco Courier. Nr 11. 1955
Schopenhauer's definition of wo¬
man as a creature with a good
head of hair but very little
brain has probably made its author
known to more people than all the
rest of his philosophy put together.
It is still remembered whereas
Schopenhauer's philosophy is half
forgotten and women have long
since cut off much of their hair.
In all countries and down the
centuries men have been unsparing
in their mordant opinions on the
mothers of the human race. Soc¬
rates in ancient Greece, described
woman as the source of all evil.
"Her love", he said "is more to be
feared than the hatred of man".
And at just about the same period
the Buddhists were even more
categorical. "Woman is a creature
who looks like an angel, but who is
a devil at heart", they declared.
Now what was to be done with
such a fundamentally bad nature except
try to subdue it? As the innocent
victims of these furies, men were well
placed for the task they made and
enforced the laws. So down the years
they wrote books, drew up laws and
found ways of keeping women in a
continuing state of mental childishness.
To convince women that this was
right was another matter. So men set
down their arguments in books on
education, and even a glance at these
reveals such a wealth of unflattering
remarks on womankind that it is
difficult to know which to choose. A
typical one taken from Orma Daigaku,
a famous Japanese book on education
written in the 17th century, proclaims
"such is the stupidity of woman that

she should be continually on guard
against herself".
Women, however, were just as intent
on escaping from this state of affairs
as men were in maintaining it. As soon
as tradition no longer systematically
excluded them from civic, political and
artistic life, they showed their capaci¬
ties as rulers (the queens and woman
regents in Europe during the 16th cen¬
tury provide striking proof of this),
writers and talented artists. Let us
single out a few women from different
continents who as writers and artists
won honoured places in these fields of
human achievement.
There is hardly any need to mention
the Greek poetess, Sappho, whose
genius has already been so much ex¬
tolled. Such was her fame that her
odes, translated into the language of
the Pharaohs, have been unearthed by
archaeologists in Egypt. Swin¬
burne described her as the
greatest poet in the absolute
sense of that term.
Less well known is Ts'ai Yen
who lived in China at the end
of the Hun dynasty, a period
which shone so brilliantly dur¬
ing the' last centuries before
the Christian era. Her father,
Ts'ai Yong, a high official,
brought her up amid all the
material and spiritual refine¬
ments of that period. She
was widowed at a very early
age, and then her life was
completely disrupted at the
end of the Second Century A.D.
by the invasion of the Huns,
who under the command of
Attila, were to threaten the
total destruction of Roman
civilization.
The Huns dragged her away
with them beyond the Great
Wall built for the defence of
the Empire. For twelve years
she was a slave, but during her
captivity she wrote one of the
most celebrated and moving
works in Chinese poetry:
"Eighteen measures sung to

and philologist and was formerly attached

French Foreign Ministry. She has written

Morts.
the sound of the Hun's trumpet". In
it she captures the wild desolation of
the barbarian camps, where every¬
thing was strange and foreign to this
refined and captive woman: "I no lon¬
ger have anyone in the world except
these unbridled hordes who force me
to follow them to the ends of the
earth. The road back is barred to me
by mountain peaks crowned with
clouds. There is only the swirling sand
whipped up by the desert -wind."
Nothing could calm Ts'ai Yen's des¬
pair. Everything about her masters
irritated her ; their savagery, their
tents, their chariots, their endless
herds, their food. Her hope had one
lodestar: the huge Wall behind which
lay the world that had once been hers.
They gave her a husband: a warrior
Hun. She bore him two children,
whom she nurtured and loved, for
though they were the children of a
barbarian, they were nevertheless of
her own flesh and blood; but there was
no peace in her heart.
Nor can my soul forget
Eventually the Emperor's envoys
ransomed her; the war was over;
Ts'ai Yen could return to her own
people. But then arose a conflict in
her soul that was never to be stilled:
On the one side, China; on the other,
the children her children.
After being torn with anguish by the
memory of her native land, she was
now tortured by the thought of her
children with the barbarians. "My
children and myself at opposite ends of
the world! Like the setting sun and
the rising moon, watching each other
from afar, and never drawing near to
one another". Her mother's heart
never again found peace, "for", she
said, "no river returns to its source, nor
can my soul forget".
Whereas Ts'ai Yen's life was convulsed
by war and its tragic effects, Murasaki-
no-Shikibu, author of that masterpiece
of classical Japanese literature, Genji
Monogatar (The Story of Prince Genji),
lived at the close of one of the most
brilliant and civilized cen-
turies in the cultural his- ' ont
tory of Japan. This period, next P°Se)

(Continued)
deeply influenced by Chinese and
Korean culture, but already steeped in
a specifically Japanese atmosphere, was
known as the Heian era, and saw the
birth of Kyoto, "The city of peace".
It was about the year 1004 that
Murasaki-no-Shikibu, widow of a high
official of the Court and lady-in-wait¬
ing to the Empress, finished writing her
long novel, which, in fifty-four chapters
(the complete English translation runs
to six large volumes), describes the life
of two generations: that of Prince
Genji, an imaginary character, and
that of his son Kaoru. Although, dur¬
ing those times, many women writers
were famed in Japan, and still are,
Murasaki is outstanding because she
started a new fashion by substituting
for the legendary tale with its marvels,
a romantic-realist novel, which reflect¬
ed the life of that epoch.
Like the characters of Proust, to
which those of the Japanese writer's
great novel have often been compared,
all her personages are imaginary, but
they are so true to life that a whole
civilization is reflected in them, and
they remain an inexhaustible source for
the study of an ultra-civilized society
on the verge of decline.
It is significant that the first two
great psychological novels of Japan and
of the West alike, should have been
written by women: Murasaki's The
Story of Prince Genji and Mme de La
Fayette's The Princess of Cleves. The
first inaugurated, in an admirable
literary style, the long psychological
tale; the second created the concisely
written psychological novel, in which
there is not a superfluous word. Ma¬
dame de La Fayette, also lived in the
centre of a refined and cultured world,
where women were not excluded from
the intellectual pursuits of men. She
was the friend of the philosophers,
poets and scientists of her age and
lady-in-waiting to Louis XIV's sister-
in-law.
The candid princess
She wrote a book which was, and still
is, a perfect example of the style
she created. The story is a simple
one: the young and beautiful Princess
of Cleves respects but does not love her
husband; she loves, and is loved by, the
Prince of Nemours. Out of loyalty, she
tells her husband, thereby destroying
his peace of mind for ever. Three cent¬
uries have passed since The Princess of
Cleves was written; and the moralists
still cannot agree whether the princess
should or should not have told her
husband...
In the same century, while Mme de
La Fayette was launching the psycholo¬
gical novel upon the Western World,
there lived in New Spain in Mexico
one of the most extraordinary figures,
not only of Latin America but of the
intellectual history of any age: Sister
Juana Inés de la Cruz.
Born in 1651, when the Spanish Em¬
pire revived by the New World, was
passing through its most brilliant
period, Sister Juana, even from the age
of four, burned with the desire to learn.
The range of her knowledge she was
musician, poetess and mathematician'
soon astonished and almost alarmed
her friends, her teachers, and the
scientists. She was familiar with every
branch of study. She read, wrote, car¬
ried out scientific research and compos¬
ed poems which gave her a unique
place not only in the literature of the
colonial period but in the history of
literature in general.
But the world could not satisfy her
longing for the absolute; she entered a
convent, still consumed by her thirst
for knowledge. Then, one day, she sold
her library of four thousand volumes
and her jewels, gave the proceeds away
as alms, and spent the rest of her life
caring for the victims of disease. She
died at the age of forty-four, from a
plague contracted at the sick-bed, just
when Spanish Mexico was entering
upon its decline.
There are so many other illustrious
women about whom one could speak
for whenever women have lived in an
atmosphere favourable to the develop¬
ment of intellectual talents, they have
produced great works. Perhaps the
best proof of this rule is offered by one
of the exceptions to it in this case a
woman painter.
Séraphine Louis, known as Séraphine
de Senlis, was a charwoman. She was
born in 1864, in the French village of
Assy, and as a girl minded cattle.
When still very young, she came to
Senlis, the small, austere town in the
Ile-de-France, whose name she was
later to be given. Séraphine spent her
time washing dishes, sweeping and
polishing floors. At the end of the
XlXth century life was far from easy
for those who worked as hired labour.
Séraphine lived a wretched existence.
One day, she began to paint. She, who
had never held anything but a broom
in her hands, handled the paint-brush
with ease.
The charwoman-painter
She painted flowers, fruit extraord¬
inary flowers and fruit. By a
process which she kept secret, she
mixed her colours in such a way as to
give them a richness and brilliance
which astound those who today visit
modern art museums where her works
are hung. Her neighbours, fellow-
workers and employers made fun of
her, but she shut herself in her room
and painted.
One day she decided to do nothing
but paint, come what might. A Ger¬
man art critic, Wilhelm Uhde, who
organized the first exhibition of Le
Douanier Rousseau, discovered her,
helped her and provided her with
paints. Séraphine, although now an
old woman, overcame with what
amounted almost to a frenzy, the
obstacles created by her ignorance.
But one day her mind gave way. She
was finally placed in an asylum at
Clermont-Ferrand, where she died four
years later (in 1934), destitute and
forgotten by the world. Today, art
galleries in all parts of the world are
proud to possess a "Séraphine dé
Senlis".

Unesco Courier. H' 11. 1955
Letters to the Editor
Sir,
I want you to know how much I
enjoy reading your magazine. During
my work as an inspector of primary
schools I shall show the Unesco Courier
to headmasters and headmistresses and
get them to take out subscriptions for
their schools. Teachers will find it a
rich, up-to-date source of information,
sometimes amusing, often moving and
always aptly illustrated. Older school¬
children, particularly, will learn much
from it and find food for reflexion and
comparison. The most recent issue,
"Conquest of the Desert", will undoubt¬
edly interest the majority of my staff.
As an Esperantist I should like to see
an edition of your magazine published
in Esperanto since for nearly a year
now the Universal Esperanto Asso¬
ciation has had consultative status with
Unesco. While such an edition might
be a little premature at present, don't
you think that a résumé of the main
articles printed in Esperanto would be
welcomed in some of the countries
which do not receive the Courier in
their own national language? This
would further extend Unesco's influence
and prestige and encourage Esperantist
associations which co-operate as the
Unesco General Conference at Monte¬
video recognized in December 1954 in
spreading education, science and culture
through their efforts to develop inter¬
national intellectual relations and
draw together the peoples of the world.
Fortuné Cadenel
Marseille, France.
Sir,
The copy of the Unesco Courier No. 5,
1955 Exploring the Oceans With
Science (Aug. 1955. U.S.A.) has so
interested us that I hope never to miss
it when it contains anything of interest
to do with oceanography or general sea
matters.
J. N. Carruthers
National Institute
of Oceanography,
Surrey, England.
Sir,
There is a social problem which
should be widely known: the manufac¬
ture and sale of toys representing
weapons or instruments of aggression.
Shops are full of toy weapons of all
kinds, and children use the toy pistols,
rifles, tanks etc. their parents buy them
to play at wars with their friends along
the street, with "wounded" and "dead".
If children learn indifference to the
sorrows of others, they will never do
anything to spare their fellows unhap-
piness; they will on the contrary be
callous and aggressive. They will rely
on whatever means of attack they have
at hand and will regard the impression
which their toy weapons make as
entitling them to impose their will. As
time goes by, their attitude will grow
more cynical as the power of their
weapons increases, and they will feel
superior to people who have had a more
civilized upbringing.
On the other hand, the child brought
up in a healthy moral atmosphere of
unselfish games, hobbies, and sport will
grow into a well-balanced youth possess¬
ing the personality to find the path of
duty and courage without the need of a
military band to guide him.

Sir,
I am ordering 20 copies of the
No 6, 1955 issue (English edition) of
the Unesco Courier Twisted Images:

Sir,
I really admire the achievements of
the Unesco Courier. I have rarely
come across such an intelligent maga¬
zine nor one so capable of interesting
people with widely different tastes.

Sir,
I get a great deal of pleasure from
your magazine which is so full of dis¬
coveries and new facts. Among the
issues which I found quite remarkable
were those devoted to "The Last Fron¬
tiers of Civilization" and ''Forgotten
Shadows the Birth of the Cinema."

Sir,
My thanks to the Unesco Courier
for introducing us to so many varied
aspects of life on our planet, which
retains its extraordinary diversity while
growing ever smaller. The recent ar¬
ticle, "Indians with an Axe to Grind",
for example, vividly showed how an in¬
vention can disrupt a way to life. The
fact that men do not immediately adapt
themselves to the new situation and
even commit barbarous acts is a transi¬
tory thing. Mankind's entire history
seems marked by such inventions both
material and intellectual from making
fire to splitting atoms, and between
them the alphabet writing, printing,
steam power and electricity, an inter¬
national language, Esperanto, aero¬
nautics, modern mathematics and a
thousand and one other technical or
cultural inventions never one without
the other.
Today we are travelling more or less
peacefullythat is, with varying degrees
of savagerytowards a unification of
mankind through a greater knowledge
of matter and a better understanding
of human solidarity. Within recent
months, much more is being said in the
daily press about ideas, which, only a
few years ago, were voiced by only a
few people. "Federalism" or even
"Planetisation" are terms which seem
to be becoming more generally used.
There is evidence that a new form
of humanism will spring from this state
of things a modern humanism of the
"atomic age" or the "age of robots". To
Dr. William Perrenoud, of Neuchatel
University. Switzerland, I think, goes
the credit for clarifying what he calls
"Géonism" or new humanism. The
Unesco Courier is undoubtedly helping
men of goodwill to become conscious of
this "Géonism".
Toulouse, France.
Sir,
A. Albault
I have received the first two numbers
of the Unesco Courier and am very sa¬
tisfied with them.
...The effort to promote understanding
between peoples is a significant feature
of our time. Although it seems natural
that we should not all have the same
ideas, I welcome everything that raises
man above prejudices of race or doc¬
trine and brings out those qualities that
are common to all mankind.
It is true that there is a long way to
go before we achieve world-wide under¬
standing, and our material and intellec¬
tual advances are not always accom¬
panied by moral progress.
Moreover there is a serious and
distressing fact that may well bring to
nought the finest efforts and confirm
the theory of man's essential wicked¬
ness, a fact which we either fear to
denounce or prefer serenely to ignore:
the world's unbalanced state is the
inevitable result of desire to make
profits.
My aim in writing this letter is the
social one of seeking to associate my¬
self with any endeavour whose aim is
bénéficient.

From the Unesco Newsroom
M,Lore books for
ASIA: In 1950, UNESCO helped
to open a model public library
in New Delhi which, within a
year of its opening had 2,300
readers daily, more than three-
quarters of whom had never
used a library before. In five
years it has lent over a million
books. In October librarians
and educators from 19 countries
met in the library to -work out
plans for the development of
more libraries of this kind in
Asia. Many more people in
Asia want to read than there
are libraries to serve them.
PICKING GOOD FTÏ.MS
One headache for parents
how to prevent chitaren ¡rom
seeing the wrong types of
filmsmay be removed
following a recent Unesco-
sponsored meeting in Edin¬
burgh. Representatives of the
film industry and organiza¬
tions concerned with child
welfare agreed to set up an
International Children's Film
Centre, with assistance from
Unesco. Due to open in
1957, the Centre will act as
a clearing house for infor¬
mation on films from all
countries fit for children to
see. Across the world in In¬
dia a Children's Film Socie¬
ty has been set up to produce
and distribute films for In¬
dian children. The Society
will also try and weed out all
films which could have a
harmful effect on young peo¬
ple.
X. B. PROTECTION FOR
8,000,000: Eight million children
have been given anti-TB vacci¬
nations this year, according to
the United Nations Children's
Fund (Unicef), bringing the to¬
tal since 1948 to more than 50
million. Children and mothers
who have received direct aid
through unicef's world-wide
projects this year number no
less than seventeen million.
This is more than half-way to¬
wards this year's target figure
for giving assistance to 32 mil¬
lion mothers and children. For
1 1 s world-wide anti-malaria
campaign tjnicef's Executive
Board has just allocated
$ 2,400,000 largest single sum
allocated in the Fund's nine-
year history for assisting a
five-year Mexican Government
campaign. The plan aims to
protect 17 million persons living
in malaria-ridden areas.
LIVING HISTORY ON
RECORDS: Gramophone re¬
cords of highlights of U.N.
activities from 1950 to 1955
were on sale in New York
on United Nations Day. Oc¬
tober 24. Entitled: "This is
U. N.: Its Actual Voices",
the record album is the se-
cond of a series recording the
voices of leading members of
the U.N. secretariat and
U.N. radio reporters in the
field. Extracts tell the U.N.
story and those of many of
its Specialized Agencies over
the past five years. The al¬
bum costs Sil.75 and is ob¬
tainable by post from Tri¬
bune Productions Inc., 251
Broadway, New York 7. Pay¬
ment can be made with
Unesco coupons.
MoSCOW - NEW YORK
EXCHANGES : One hundred
modern Russian paintings, se¬
lected in Moscow by the Direc¬
tor of the National Arts
Foundation of New York,
Dr. Carlton Smith, are to be
exhibited in the U.S.A. In re¬
turn the Foundation will send a
similar number of contemporary
American paintings to Moscow.
Dr. Carlton Smith also invited
the famous Obraztosov Puppet
Theatre as well as Russian sing¬
ers and dancers to tour the
United States. On behalf oi
the Stanislawski Museum in
Moscow, the National Arts
Foundation is appealing for
any letters and manuscripts of
famous Russian theatre direc¬
tors which may exist in the Uni¬
ted States. These will be photo¬
copied and sent to Moscow.
In exchange the Foundation has
asked Moscow for a manuscript
of one of Mussorgsky's works
which will be produced by New
York's Metropolitan Opera.
LOST HOMELANDS: By
1952 nearly 29 million refu¬
gees had lost their home¬
lands and were faced with
the problem of how to put
down new roots. "Flight
and Resettlement", a recent¬
ly published unesco study,
describes what has happened
to these millions of people
since the war, and what suc¬
cesses they have had start
ing life afresh in new coun¬
tries. The study makes dra¬
matic reading. There is a
detailed survey of the men¬
tal disorders suffered by re¬
fugees when trying to adjust
themselves to a new way of
life. The tragedy of the
fleeing refugees comes to life
in passages like the follow-'
ing: "In the spring of 1945
the roads of Germany and
Austria were teeming with
uprooted humanity. Amidst
these moving masses chil¬
dren were wandering singly
or in groups. They were in¬
distinguishable from the
adults and they seemed moti¬
vated by the same uncontrol¬
lable desire to keep on mov¬
ing, to get somewhere.
When the process of sin¬
gling them out got under
way, it became apparent that
thousands of children were
completely on their own."
KaLINGA PRIZE
AWARD: Dr. August Pi Suner,
Spanich physiologist and at
present director of the Institute
of Experimental Medicine at the
University of Caracas, Vene¬
zuela, has been awarded the
1955 Kalinga prize of £ 1,000 for
his work in popularizing scien-
tries. The Kalinga prize, award-
ce in Spanish-speakm<r coun-
ed annually by unesco, was
established by Mr. B. i-^maik ut
the Indian State of Orissa. Ka¬
linga was the name of the In¬
dian Empire conquered more
than 2,000 years ago by King
Asolea at such cost that he
swore never to wage war again.
Previous prize winners have
included; Professor Louis de
Broglie, of Paris, Dr. Julian
Huxley, of London (Unesco's
first Director-General) , and
Mr. Waldemar Kaempffert
science editor of the New York
Times.
* UNESCO ARTIST FEL¬
LOWSHIPS: Fourteen new
fellowships for writers and
artists (composers, painters,
sculptors, engravers and ar¬
chitects) were recently esta¬
blished by unesco. These
fellowships will last six
months and will provide a
monthly allowance of bet¬
ween $200 and $300. Unesco
will also pay travel expenses
different countries. The Gift
Coupon Scheme continues to
grow. In early 1954 only 11
countries participated as do¬
nors in the ¡programme. To¬
day 18 are taking part and
others are due to join.
France ratifies
copyright convention:
France became the sixteenth
country to ratify the Universal
Copyright Convention, when
M. Jean Pierre Cabouat, perma¬
nent French delegate to Unesco,
deposited instruments of ratifi¬
cation on October 14. M. Ca¬
bouat paid tribute to Unesco's
efforts in the protection of
literary, artistic and scientific
work.
FAMOUS BIOGRAPHIES
ON THE T.V. SCREEN
THE production of a series of biographical films on the great living
personalities in science and culture of every country was
suggested at a meeting of cinema and T.V. representatives from
15 countries held in Tangier recently under Unesco's auspices. This
is the first time that a meeting of T.V. and film experts from three
continents has been held. Discussing ways to increase co-operation
between both media, delegates decided that it would be useful ta
set up an International Film Centre for Television under the auspices
of Unesco.
This would be a non-profit-making organization, administered
equally by film and T.V. representatives, and its first task -would
be to establish film libraries in Paris and New York where films for
international exchange would be available for viewing. Discussions
centred on ways of turning the traditional competition between films
and television into a working collaboration, and it was agreed that
T.V. now offers greater openings for cultural and educational films.
Delegates drew up lists of films which they were prepared to offer
for international exchange and of foreign films they would like to
borrow. They also studied how to overcome technical, legal and
economic obstacles to the free exchange of films between countries
for use by television.
and the cost of purchasing
books and other working ma¬
terials, and the renting of
workrooms or studios and
musical instruments.
]VeW U.N. STAMP DE¬
SIGNS: A panel of six artists,
all from different countries, has
been selected by the U.N. Postal
Administration to design U.N.
stamps for 1956. Countries re¬
presented on the panel are Aus¬
tralia, France, Israel, Mexico,
the U. K. and the U.S.A. At
the end of the year, artists from
six others countries will take
the places of the present mem¬
bers of the panel.
GIFT COUPONS BUILD
SCHOOLS: A rapidly-grow¬
ing Greek town in Macedo¬
nia now has its third prima¬
ry school thanks to volun¬
teer labour and Unesco Gift
Coupons. This school in
Yannitsa was built by the
parents, teachers and chil¬
dren themselves and entirely
equipped through Gift Cou¬
pon donations from many
* WOMEN'S RADIO PRO¬
GRAMMES: Twenty-three
women radio broadcasters
from 11 different countries
recently met in Unesco
House, Paris, to exchange
ideas on the content of radio
programmes for women, and
on the suitability of certain
subjects for broadcasting on
sound radio or TV. They
agreed that science should
play a more important part
in women's programmes.
Unexplored oceans:
Exploring uncharted oceans and
Investigating the mysteries of
the sea were discussed at three
meetings held in Tokyo recently
under the the auspices of
Unesco. One of the major
subjects discussed was the help
Unesco could give research
workers in the vast field of
oceanography where interna¬
tional co-operation is indispen¬
sable. Exploration of the
world's oceans is still far from
complete and an immense ex¬
panse of the Indian Ocean,
lying mainly between the Equa¬
tor and Latitude 40 South, is
still virtually unknown territory.
