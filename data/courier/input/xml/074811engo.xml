The twin with open eyes
Carved in hard greenish stone, this mask from British Columbia (Canada) is an outstanding example
of North-west American Indian art. Above the open eyes, the eyebrows are traced in rough stone,
while the "skin" of the face has been finely polished. An identical mask (except that its eyes are
closed) belongs to Canada's National Museum of Man, Ottawa. This "twin" mask fits ingeniously
into the mask shown here, which is today in the Musée de l'Homme, Paris.

Cover
The peoples of modern Africa are
rediscovering an unrivalled source of
inspiration and richness in their ancient
culture, with all its diversity and
originality. For in spite of colonization,
African culture was never obliterated.
In many parts of the world its
vigour and authenticity have
exercised a rejuvenating influence
in such fields as sculpture, painting,
music and dance. This issue of the
Unesco Courier examines different
aspects of the cultural
renaissance of Africa today.

In this issue, the Unesco Courier looks at some of the most significant aspects of the cultural life
of Black Africa and reveals the contribution to current trends of Africa's traditional heritage, with
all its richness, diversity and originality. This issue is mainly concerned with tropical Africa.
As far as southern Africa is concerned, the Unesco Courier plans to examine in a forthcoming issue
the obstacles which today obstruct recognition of the most fundamental human rights in this part of
the continent, where many peoples are still the victims of racial discrimination and apartheid.
Finally, the cultural heritage of northern Africa will be evoked at the end of the year in an issue
which will present a broad picture of the great Islamic cultures which have left a profound
imprint on a vast region of the world stretching across north Africa to the Middle East.
Africa
rediscovers
its cultural
roots
THE African peoples have for¬
mulated, in the course of
their long history, their visions
of man and the world. They have
created their values and assigned an
order of importance to these values,
accordance with their own inspi¬
ration. There is no African culture,
whether sacred or profane, that has
not assimilated the highest values of
the human speciesreligious, moral,
social, aesthetic, economic, theore¬
tical and technical.
The assertion of cultural identity
in Africa is not a reflection of a need
to vaunt a sense of individuality. It
is neither a mere affirmation of the
right to be different, nor a sign of
political crisis or economic disarray.
Nor, again, is it a pathological reaction
to the traumatic experience of colo¬
nialism.
It is neither a self-defensive reflex
in the face of assaults by technolo¬
gically-inspired culture, nor an attempt
at self-purification through the des¬
truction of the bacteria of ideological
This article reflects the conclusions of the
Intergovernmental Conference on Cultural
Policies in Africa. It has been adapted
from "Problems and Prospects", a Unesco
document relating to the Conference.
Organized by Unesco with the co-operation
of the Ghanaian Government and the Orga¬
nization of African Unity, the Conference
was held in Accra (Ghana) from 27 October
to 6 November 1975. It was attended by
delegates from 30 African countries and
representatives and observers from many
parts of the world.
pollution. Lastly, it is in no way
the expression of an embittered,
chauvinistic nationalism adopting
for its own purposes the style and
methods of the cultural imperialism
of the former colonizers.
If the assertion of cultural identity
in Africa were rooted in such consi¬
derations, it would forfeit its validity.
It would even be reprehensible if it
were prompted by hatred or racism
and nourished by resentment.
By tracing the most characteristic
features of the African personality
we shall see that the assertion of
cultural identity in Africa has an infi¬
nitely more authentic and healthier
basis.
There is ample evidence to show
that the circulation of ideas and
objects between African cultures and
between Africa and other parts of
the world is an age-old process.
Limited at the outset to the coasts
and great natural waterways such
as the Senegal, the Niger, the Zam¬
besi and the Nile, it subsequently
reached out in all directions.
The Sahara itself, reputed to con¬
stitute a natural obstacle to exchan¬
ges, served in fact as a link between
different regionsas the magnificent
stone engravings of Tassili and Ténéré
reveal.
An immense and virtually unexplor¬
ed field of research exists here, and

^fricanwhose union and interpéné¬
tration constitute the basis of African
identity.
It is among the people living in
rural communities whose history
stretches back to the earliest times
that the distinctive signs of African
identity can still be found. The
similarities which exist between these
signs reflect the richness and cre¬
ativity of this essential "Africanness".
The fact that these ancient so¬
cieties, often living in virtual isola¬
tion, remained to all intents and pur¬
poses outside the reach of colonization
has meant that mother tongues are
the only languages used. This has
resulted in the creation of an oral
literature which is as imaginative as
it is varied.
The family is the essential frame¬
work of these age-old cultures. It
is the custodian of tradition, in whose
transmission it plays a vital part,
owing to the fact that several gen¬
erations live together.
Since time immemorial, tradition
has affected every aspect of human
activity. It provides each person
with the necessary rules for personal
conduct and for coping with everyday
life. Spirituality surrounds and
imbues men and women, objects and
the world of nature. It constitutes
a code whose application is super¬
vised by the very old, whose role
it is to serve as a living library,
accessible to everyone and at all
times.
One of the original features of the
African identity is rooted in a complex
series of circumstances which date
from the beginning of the 19th cen¬
tury and which affected most African
societies at the same time and in a
similar way. This was the colonial
expansionism which subjected them
to occupation and exploitation.
African cultures were destined to
be geographically fragmented and
isolated from each other. A single
cultural area might be arbitrarily
split up, resulting not only in the
rupture of age-old links but in disin¬
tegration and in the breakdown of
structures.
Certain cultural areas were deli¬
berately favoured at the expense of
others, seriously upsetting social,
economic and political balances.
From then onwards, there was a
steadily widening gap between town
and country, between the coast and
the hinterland, between "pacified"
and "unsubdued" regions.
Geographic fragmentation was
combined with a break in time. Co¬
lonialism sought to sever the Afri¬
can's links with his past, his tradi¬
tions and his culture. Traditional
schools were closed down, places
and objects of worship were des¬
troyed, and a campaign was waged
against indigenous teachers.
In the cultural vacuum thus cre¬
ated, Africans were to be trained
albeit to a very limited extent in a
new language and according to new
patterns of thought. Colonial edu¬
cation was, first and foremost, a
means of conquest, submission and
alienation.
The safeguarding of values, the
restoration of languages, the asser¬
tion of identitythese are the causes

in whose name resistance was orga¬
nized and the struggle for liberation
waged. African cultures pointed
the way to individual self-rediscovery
and national restoration, reconstruc¬
tion and mobilization.
It is particularly significant that the
quest for freedom has coincided,
throughout the whole of Africa, with
the quest for cultural identity: to
assert one's personality is to perform
an act of liberation.
The struggle for independence thus
reflects not only a political but also
a cultural demand. This cultural
aspect takes the form of an enthu¬
siastic rediscovery of ancestral cul¬
ture, a renewed awareness of the
past, and a denial of the colonizer's
insistence on setting up his own
civilization as a universal model.
In challenging the cultural supre¬
macy of the West, the African peoples
have rediscovered their own civili¬
zation. Africa was not a complete
blank before colonial invasion; it
had produced knowledge and skills
as well as works of great value in
such fields as architecture, sculpture,
music, dance, poetry and oral
literature.
Africans were well aware of the
existence of these expressions of
their tradition, which they continued
to produce themselves and which
formed part of their everyday life.
But what has changed is their way
of regarding them. These works
are now seen as the meaningful
products of an authentic cultural
creativity.
In rediscovering their own civili¬
zation, the African peoples are be¬
coming aware, at the same time,
that the values of Western civilization
are relative. They now realize that
the scientific and technological de¬
velopment of a society does not invest
it with any moral or aesthetic
superiority.
They are discovering that history
is still an unfinished process, that it
is not merely the product of the West,
and that the African peoples them¬
selves also have a part in making it.
They are regaining confidence in
their future.
In other words, cultural nationalism
is the assertion of a collective per¬
sonality. It must, however, take
care to avoid impoverishing the cul¬
tural heritage which it claims to de¬
fend, by reducing it to a mere anti¬
thesis of cultures that are alien. To
do so would be to strip African cul¬
tures of their own rich, colourful
and complex heritage.
For African traditions, like those
of Europe or China, have been handed
down from generation to generation

throughout an eventful history which
came to an end neither with colo¬
nization nor even with decolonization,
but is still a continuing and unfore¬
seeable process.
In most African countries, the mo¬
del of Western development exercises
an undeniable fascination. In the
economic field, the very existence of
some African countries still seems to
depend on the former colonial powers.
Large-scale, uncontrolled transfers
of manufactured goods and mani¬
pulation of all kinds have enslaved
the imagination and created artificial
needs. This process can only per¬
petuate the myths and glamour of
the consumer society and aggravate
the errors that are due to colonial
domination.
The imitation of foreign modes of
life can only destroy the environment
necessary to the resurgence and de¬
velopment of African cultures, by
depriving it of its social, religious and
economic significance.
The social and cultural history of
Africa and of its relations with the
West thus reveals the unreliability
of the theory of cultural interpéné¬
trationthat is, the idea that societies
have a fruitful and constructive in¬
fluence upon each other.
There can, of course, be no question
of advocating some sort of economic
or cultural isolationism for Africa.
But an outward-looking attitude
towards the rest of the world should
not imply the indiscriminate adoption
of a form of modernity which would
cut off a people from its past and
make it lose its personality; nor
should it mean imitating models of
growth whose inegalitarian nature is
fundamentally opposed to the highest
African traditions. . For while Africa
intends to develop, she also intends
to preserve her personality.
It has been claimed that if the
developing countries have failed to
achieve their economic "take-off",
this is essentially because of cultural
factors. It would appear that resis¬
tance to change stems in particular
from the non-competitive nature of
traditional societies, from a social
organization based on solidarity, and
also from certain religious rules.
Competition, as it is defined and
valued in the West, probably does not
exist in traditional societies. Would
it not, however, be more accurate to
describe such competition, not as a
cause of development or underdeve¬
lopment, but as an inherent charac¬
teristic of the Western economic^
system? ' f

, The motive force of African society
is basically the development of the
collective personality, rather than
individual success or profit. Simi¬
larly, African culture is essentially
popular and democratic in nature.
Another type of resistance to the
frantic desire for development that
is exclusively economic can be seen
in the relationship these traditional
societies have with the land. The
overriding importance they attach to
nature can indeed sometimes lead
to a rejection of certain techniques.
However, instead of indicating a kind
of irrationality, this attitude reveals
a rationality of a kind that differs from
Western economic rationality.
In addition, the idea of transferable
property hardly . existshence the
refusal to surrender collectively-
owned land. This characteristic of
African societies and cultures should
be seen as a useful factor in any
agrarian reforms that may be carried
out, rather than as a brake on deve¬
lopment.
Traditional economies ensure the
subsistence of all the members of a
community, whatever the nature of
its structure. Contrary to the norms
of the consumer, society, all these
societies work on the principle that
only commodities necessary to meet
vital needs should be produced.
The lesson these societies can give
to the West is a philosophical one
that nature is neither a reservoir from
which one can draw indefinitely and
with impunity, nor a collection of
potential goods of which one has
only to become "lord and master".
To destroy the overall equilibrium is
to destroy oneself as well.
If development is not to be syno¬
nymous with rejection of the past
and to lead to new forms. of aliena¬
tion, it must further the full expression
of the most authentic African cultural
values, and in particular the oral tra¬
ditions and national languages.
The very quest for authenticity
implies its absence: the loss of one's
own personality. Thus one may
well ask whether this is a problem
for those who have never been cut
off from the living popular culture of
their community. The term "authen
ticity" does not have the same mean¬
ing for the African peasant as for
the African intellectual indeed for
the peasant it has perhaps no mean¬
ing at all.
If we take oral expression as an
example, we must recognize that this
social and cultural form, so wides¬
pread in Africa, probably does not
have the same significance for the
literate as for those who have never
even seen a transcription of their
language. How does this difference
arise?
Oral expression, of whose immense
riches we are still. only dimly aware,
is not by any means a sign of social
backwardness. The appearance of
writing does not necessarily reflect
a transition to a "higher" level of
culture.
Oral tradition, as the means of
expression of a civilization, is always
closely bound up with the different
aspects of social life. Among its
many and varied functions, it acts
as the "memory" of society and trans¬
mits codes of behaviour and aesthe¬
tic expression. Deeply rooted in
society, it describes and explains a
vast range of phenomena: history,
ritual, the natural environment, the
organization of society, technical
skills, human relations, and relation¬
ships with neighbouring . ethnic
groups.
In other words, oral tradition is a
form of instruction which is handed
down from generation to generation.
Far from being confined to a single
family or village, it is common to an
entire ethnic group and often to seve¬
ral such groups.
As a form of instruction about the
past, it provides people with a frame
of reference concerning their society
and the world.
As a form of instruction about the
present, it teaches children the beha¬
viour, attitudes and beliefs they will
have to adopt, familiarizing them with
the rules and standards of conduct
which custom demands and encou¬
raging them to develop their per¬
sonality within the framework of
their society.
The particular nature of oral com¬
munication has a decisive influence
both on the content of a culture and
on its transmission. The transmission
of language is a direct process carried
out among the members of the group,
who have no dictionaries or word-
lists to refer to. The relationship
between the spoken word and what
it denotes is direct and straight¬
forward.
The accumulation of references, on
which civilizations based on written
traditions so much depend, is less
important in civilizations which ex¬
press themselves for the most part
orally. In the latter, the meanings
of words are understood by refe-

rence to practical situations which
members of the group have expe¬
rienced.
Traditions are "stored" in the mem¬
ory of society. The memory of the
individual acts as a filter for the
collective memory, which is enlarged
and enriched by successive genera¬
tions in a constant process of inter¬
pretation and assimilation of new
experience. Memory is, indeed,
knowledge, but knowledge of a
constantly changing kind. It has
no fixed point, although certain fac¬
tors confer on it a large measure of
permanence.
The first and perhaps the most
effective of these factors lies in the
particular manner in which human
beings relate to their environment.
It has been observed that the des¬
truction or loss of this environment
deprives the individual of a source of
information whose absence leads to
a steep decline in his capacities of
.memory and knowledge. In African
history this occurred notably with the
transportation of African tribes to
America in colonial times.
The second factor making for per¬
manence is the institutionalization of
knowledge. In many societies the
transmission of the cultural heritage
through historical anecdotes or le¬
gends is the responsibility of specially
selected persons such as the griots
(story-tellers) or simply of the older
people in the village who are ex¬
tremely well-versed in genealogy.
The third factor in ensuring perma¬
nence is rhythmic utterance, the lan¬
guage of the drum.
Powerful though they are, these
factors do not offset the corrosive
effect of fading memory. It is as if
the social functions of memory for¬
med part of a complex process whose
aim is to maintain and reproduce the
conditions of social life.
Hence the importance of genea¬
logies, which define the rights and
duties of each member of the group,,
who can thereby claim a place to live,
defend himself in litigation, conduct
a ceremony or resolve a conflict.
Since the political structure is some¬
times based on kinship, genealogies
also play an essential part in the
maintenance., of order.
Shifting and changeable, they are
reformulated on the occasion of a
death, a birth, or migration. This
constant rectification is accompanied
by what has been termed "structural
amnesia".
One of the dangers of written
expression is to treat the social order
as an abstraction and to present it
in the false colours of permanence.
The alphabet introduces a form of
universality that transcends the clan,
the tribe or the nation, though it also
implies greater rigour and sometimes
even rigidity.
Writing also introduces social stra¬
tification, creating a division between
two main groups: the literate élite
and the illiterate masses. Here,
since we are- dealing with the safe¬
guarding of cultural authenticity, one
is tempted to point out that, however
pernicious illiteracy may be else¬
where, in traditional societies it can
never have been synonymous with
cultural impoverishment; on the other
hand, it is through education that
the élite has often been cut off from
its roots and traditions. All educa¬
tional systems should bear this in
mind.
African oral literature is highly
imaginative both in form and in
content. Levels of interpretation
vary within the group according to
the listener's degree of initiation. It
is a total art, based on the effective
participation of each and everyone.
The verbal message is interwoven
with messages conveyed by gesture,
music and rhythm with a freedom of
expression and improvisation which
permit its value and meaning to sur¬
vive the passage of time.
The vast wealth of oral tradition,
which embraces legend, history and
initiatory rituals, as well as stories of
mythical heroes, human beings and
animals, poetry and song, proverbs
and riddles, offers virtually limitless
possibilities for research. .

A living tradition
in architecture
Africa has an extraordinary wealth
of architectural styles, which, in spite
of their many differences, are all
highly functional as well as being
adapted to climatic conditions, ways
of life and work, and economic
means. Right, two
professors at Ahmadu Bello University
(Nigeria) examine the model of a
dwelling designed for a family of
the Hausa people (farmers and
craftsmen). The design incorporates
modern amenities with a respect for
the traditional character of Hausa
architecture. In 1971, students of
tropical architecture from the Pratt
Institute in New York visited the
university to study under Nigerian
teachers who were later invited to
lecture in New York on traditional
African architecture and
town-planning. Above, roof of

, with the African continent, Unesco
is currently engaged on a ten-year
plan for the study of oral tradition
and the promotion of African lan¬
guages as a medium of culture and
instrument of life-long education, and
in the preparation of a "General His¬
tory of Africa".
The investigation, preservation and
promotion of oral traditions lead quite
naturally to recognition of the over¬
riding and irreplaceable role of African
languages as a source, medium and
vehicle for African thinking and cul¬
tures, and as an instrument of social
communication for the immense ma¬
jority of the population. Hence, any
cultural renaissance in Africa and
the safeguarding of cultural authen¬
ticity must depend on the protection
and promotion of national languages.
Colonial policy failed to grasp that
African languages were "real" lan¬
guages, that is to say, media for the
transmission of knowledge and cul¬
ture. They were regarded by the
colonists as "primitive" languages,
representing a stage in evolution that
had long been superseded by Euro¬
pean languages and thus incapable
of expressing scientific thought.
What is required today is a reva¬
luation of African languages, no long¬
er for ideological purposes, but so
that the greatest possible number
maythrough these languages-
accede to knowledge of the most
up-to-date kind. National languages
must be treated as unrivalled media
of communication, whose effective¬
ness in the African milieu is un¬
matched.
African cultures are on the thresh¬
old of a decisive period during which
their custodians will seek, first and
foremost, to turn to the Africans
themselves, whose personality these
cultures will help to affirm. It will
no longer be sufficient to study these
languages as objects. It is in the
languages themselves that such
studies must be conducted.
Adult literacy campaigns will be
insufficient as long as we fail to go
to the root of the matter by basing
these techniques on the reaNties of
African life, of which the national
languages are an essential aspect.
Only through an awareness of the
fundamental role of mother tongues
in the whole range of psychological,
cognitive and social processes will
it be possible to overcome resistance
of every kind to the systematic use
of African languages in education
and training.
What is required, therefore, is a
radical overhaul of the educational
systems inherited from the past,
which must be transformed to match
the practical conditions of African
social and cultural life, involving the
active participation of the community
and meeting the needs and aspira¬
tions of the greatest possible number.
This brings us to the heavy respon¬
sibility resting on African universities,
as keystones of the educational sys¬
tem. To what extent can these uni¬
versities foresee and pave the way
for the necessary transformations,
question their own role and struc¬
tures, and further the development
process?
The future of education, science
and culture in Africa depends,
perhaps more than anything else,
on relations which have yet to be
established between the public at
large and the universities.

Decoding
the message

OLA BALOGUN is a young Nigerian film
director and writer who has been a Unesco
consultant on the training of film-makers.
He has directed a number of noted feature
films and documentaries, including Vivre

served on the jury of the Pan-African Film
Festival at Carthage (Tunisia). The author of
two plays. Shango and Le Roi-Éléphant

ALL cultures are made up of a
multiplicity of currents which
may sometimes even appear
antagonistic. Africa is no exception
to this general rule.
But although there is no single art
form narrowly identifiable as African
to the exclusion of all others, there
is a certain broad ensemble of styles
and forms, which together constitute
African art.
African art forms are seldom prac¬
tised for their entertainment value
alone. In masquerade performances,
the essential feature is the ritual
function of the performance, although
dancing and sometimes the mock
pursuit of spectators by the masque-
rader provide entertaining features.
Dancing itself is practised on the
occasion of specific festivities and
rituals, and only rarely as pure enter¬
tainment.
Perhaps the only major exception
to this rule is the art of the story¬
teller or that of the wandering mins¬
trel, whose purpose is to entertain an
audience in exchange for remunera¬
tion. Even in this case, the stories
or epic recitals often aim primarily to
provide moral lessons or useful
knowledge of the past.
The art forms commonly encoun¬
tered in African societies include
sculpture (in wood, stone, iron,
bronze, terra-cotta, etc.) architecture.
African art, whether sacred or
secular, is always the product of
refined and meticulous skills.
Household utensils and furniture
display the same dignity and
gracefulness as works of religious
art. The elegant neck-rest (right)
is supported by a couple facing
each other and joined in a chaste
and tender embrace. It is the
work of a master-craftsman of the
Luba people of southern Zaire, like
the fertility statuette (opposite
page) in which a male and female
figure present each other with a
baby girl. This sculpture is an
invocation of the "life force"
which increases the family.

music, dance, rituals incorporating
dramatic elements, and oral litera¬
ture. The range of artistic activity
covers a wider spectrum among Afri¬
can peoples than is generally as¬
sumed, and is much more complex
and diversified than ethnological
studies have generally indicated. By
looking at two examplesmasks
and wood carvingit should be
possible to throw some light on the
nature and meaning of African art.
Carving is one of the mainstays of
African art, and is the medium
through which African art has best
come to be known outside Africa.
The most striking category of wood
carving is that of carved masks de¬
signed for masquerade displays.
There has been much confusion
about such carvings, principally be¬
cause of attempts to define them
according to Western European
aesthetic criteria. . '
Such confusion is typified in the
belief that African art is "primitive".
The corollary to this belief is the
equally baseless assumption that
mankind has evolved through the
stage of "clumsy" art before finally
achieving the formal perfection of
Graeco-Latin art.
The fallacy of this line of reasoning
is obvious. In the first place aesthe¬
tic criteria do not necessarily involve
a direct imitation of natural forms.
Secondly, there is no justification,
other than an ethnocentric view of
the world, for assuming that the lack
of an aesthetic approach similar to
that which has developed in Western
Europe signifies an absence of formal
perfection. Aesthetic appreciation
of African art forms such as mask
carvings should be fundamentally
linked to an understanding of their
purpose. It is therefore necessary
to analyse the general background
and nature of African masquerades.
Masquerade performances are
generally part of ritual ceremonies
designed to invoke the gods or to
establish the communion of a commu¬
nity with them, as well as to remind
members of the community of their
relationship with non-human forces
in the universe.
The masquerade is therefore consi¬
dered as a material manifestation of
an intangible force, as a temporary
incarnation of the non-human. Such
a manifestation, however, requires
human participation in order to
become possible.
A human agent (often the masque-
rader, the mask-wearer) serves as a
vehicle for the manifestation. A sign
or a set of signs must be found to
distinguish this human agent from
other human beings and establish the
fact that for the duration of the rites
he has ceased to be a human being
and has become the embodiment of
the divinity or ancestor whose pre¬
sence is being invoked.
The most important and easily
recognizable signs lie in the realm
of costume. The costume suggests
the presence of the god and points
to a reality beyond the physical pre¬
sence of the human being who has
donned it. It is, above all, a sign, in
the same way as a few branches may
be used in theatre scenery to suggest
a forest. One of the most important
elements in this transformation is the
mask.
Once the fundamental role of the
mask (and of costume In general) in
suggesting and establishing the pre¬
sence of the supernatural is properly
understood, it becomes possible to
grasp the conceptual framework wi¬
thin which the carver works.
The Western European artists who
have been influenced by African art
apparently saw in the techniques of
the mask carvers only an attempt to
represent natural shapes in the
abstract form, and Cubism and other
movements pursued this approach to
an extreme degree.
This was, however, a mistaken
interpretation, based on ignorance of
the conceptual framework which
dictated the styles employed by Afri¬
can mask carvers. Even where an
external model exists, it is the hidden
essence of its form rather than its ex- i
ternal appearance that the carver I

L seeks to capture. The style of the
' mask carver is an approach imposed
by the system of beliefs and the
conceptual framework within which
he lives and works.
This means that there has always
been great scope for artistic freedom
and improvisation within the larger
framework of communal beliefs and
conventions. If the divinity whose
presence the mask will help to invoke
is a frightening one, the artist is not
required to make a faithful copy of
previous masks, but to convey the
idea of what a frightening presence
should look like and to suggest that
presence in his work.
Thus, he is often free to execute his
own idea of what a frightening pre¬
sence should look like, within the
framework of local artistic canons
and conventions.
African mask carvings reflect a
careful and studied mastery of cre¬
ative techniques on many levels.
Perhaps one of the most remarkable
aspects of this creative skill is the
ability to achieve astonishing simpli¬
fication of visual ideas originally
derived from natural forms.
In most mask carvings, it is as if
the carvers had sought to go beyond
the mere outward appearance of na¬
tural forms to grasp their essence,
going on from there to new creative
structures.
The Bambara headpieces from
Mali known as Tyi-wara, to take one
example, are inspired by the form and
grace of the antelope. But what
remains of the antelope as a visual
form is reduced to a suggestion of the
essential attributes of the animal,
basically its sleek lines and grace, em¬
bellished by decorative flourishes.
To look at such carvings is to be
carried beyond external form into the
being of a mythical animal whose
essence has been symbolized by the
form of the antelope.
The simplification of natural motifs
often leads the carver to develop a
geometric conception of his source of
inspiration. Thus eyes become pure
circles or squares, or simple slanted
lines which are then spatially balanced
against other features similarly con¬
ceived. The famous Basonge masks
from the Congo basin constitute a
remarkable example of these geo¬
metric forms.
Not only are the features them¬
selves cast on a geometrical pattern
of squares (for the eyes), but a collec¬
tion of curved lines running across
How the sky reached its limit
On her family farm in the Ivory Coast, a girl of the Senufo people
pounds millet into flour using a mortar and a long hardwood pestle,
familiar tools in rural Africa. According to a famous myth, the
pestle once changed the face of the earth. The myth says that
at first the sky was low down, but people became too familiar
with it and one day a woman poked it in the eye with a pestle. As
a result, the sky retreated in anger to the distance where it has
been ever since.

the whole surface in relief serves to
accentuate the whole.
In many Congolese and Gabonese
masks, the repetition of regular
curves in the lines of facial features
such as eyebrows, eyes and lips
creates a pattern of rhythms remi¬
niscent of musical rhythm.
Even more striking is the develop¬
ment of architectural patterns in
many mask carvings. Even when
the mask is made to be worn vertically
over the face, its surface is rarely flat.
It is in carving head-masks (worn
horizontally on the head) that the
fullest possible use is made of three-
dimensional space. Examples in¬
clude the Tyi-wara masks of the
Bambara people and certain Baoulé,
Senufo (Ivory Coast) and Ijaw (sou¬
thern Nigeria) headmasks. The for¬
mer represent buffalo spirits, the
latter water spirits.
During the dance, the mask-wearer
shows the mask to spectators from
different angles, creating a different
visual impact in each case. In effect,
the mask's frontal aspect is entirely
different from its "profile", and when
the masquerade dancer lowers his
head it is seen that the top of the
mask is also different.
The muzzle and teeth of the mythi¬
cal creature may be seen as the most
important part of the mask when it
is viewed from the front, while the
ears and the horns are the most strik¬
ing features from the side view. In
the top view of the mask, the teeth
and open muzzle disappear entirely,
so that the spectator sees only a
geometrical pattern built around the
features of the face.
Generally, once the essential lines
of the mask have been carved, it is
embellished by various decorative
designs, ranging from simple and
subtle touches to highly ornate
motifs. Some recent versions even
comprise representations of cars and
aeroplanes !
For sheer plastic audacity, some
African masks are hardly to be sur¬
passed. In one Bacham mask from
Cameroon, which is based on a
highly stylized representation of the
human face, the cheek bones have
become protruding conical structures
with a gently rounded top on which
the eyes rest in a horizontal plane.
The sockets beneath the eyebrows
have become elongated vertical sur¬
faces towering above the eyes, rather
like the upper lid of an oyster shell
within which each eye reposes.
This remarkably audacious treat¬
ment of surfaces (it is styles of this
type that directly inspired the Cubist
movement) would be inconceivable in
the absence of very advanced plastic
concepts.
In a sense, the mask becomes a
frozen moment in eternity, yet the
movements of the masquerade lend
it a new life and plunge it into the
rhythms of human existence.
As the mask-wearer dances, that
frozen moment of eternity grasped by
the carver's art is set in motion to.
the rhythm of the music, stimulating
the emotions of the spectators both
by the plastic rhythm of the carving
and by the larger rhythm of the dance.
All this is added to the emotional
impact caused by the social and cultu¬
ral significance of the dance ritual.
By a strange paradox, it is precisely
because the purpose to be served by
the mask must take precedence over
his private vision that the artist
achieves total liberty in his treatment
of form. The aim of his work is
most often to suggest immaterial
forms, rather than to copy nature
directly.
Most African sculptures, like the
mask carvings, are executed in wood.
"Power objects" or symbolical substi¬
tutes for ancestors and gods, they
are primarily aimed at fulfilling a
function.
The sculptor is primarily concerned
with adapting the style of the object
to its function, while complying with
already existing plastic traditions.
He hardly ever attempts to reproduce
natural traits or to base his sculpture
on realism. It is therefore rare to
find life-sized statues or even small
statues based on real-life proportions.
It is precisely because the African
sculptor has not conceived his work
exclusively in terms of creation of
forms pleasing to the eye that such
sculptures achieve startling visual
effects.

mais are generally not conceived as
visual representations of the original
object but as substitutes, for it or a
magic evocation of it. Hence the
accent is laid on symbolization of
essential traits, rather than on factual
representation as such.
In anthropomorphic figures, the
head is often on a larger scale in
proportion to the rest of the body. A
frequent device where two figures of
unequal social importance feature
in a sculpture is to reflect the diffe¬
rence in social status through a sharp
variation in proportion.
There is also scarcely ever an
attempt to show a figure in movement
or involved in some form of physical
activity such as might distract from
the balance of the sculpture.
Among the best-known categories
of African sculptures are commemo¬
rative statuettes of ancestor-figures
and ritual statuettes of gods that are
placed in religious shrines to repre¬
sent divinities or devotees of the gods
to whom such shrines are dedicated.
Such sculptures are above all
"power objects", and their efficacity
in the religious sphere is as much
dependent on the sculptor's skill as on
the rites associated with them. A
clumsily executed work or one that
falls too far outside the traditional
canons of style peculiar to the tribal
or regional zone within which it is
created would not be acceptable.
The characteristics of African sculp¬
ture are therefore closely dependent
on the entire social and cultural
context in which it is created. For
this reason attempts to encourage
the production of such works of art on
a commercial basis, in an attempt to
preserve the mere external characte¬
ristics of their style, are inevitably
doomed to failure.
It is important to understand that
the sculptor does not merely copy
the details of traditional patterns of
sculpture but uses the accepted tra¬
ditional model as an inspirational
guide from which his own creative
skill blossoms.
Mechanical copies for the purely
commercial purpose of satisfying tou¬
rist demand remain lifeless and artis¬
tically sterile, while work that has its
roots in a respect for social and cul¬
tural continuity is as vigorous from
the point of view of artistic execution
as works of art of the past.
Such sculpture is the collective
work of a civilization, and the role
of the artist is that of a medium
charged with expressing collective
beliefs and vision in material terms.
The form of the man-made object
becomes a substitute for the super¬
natural or human because it captures
and imprisons a part of the original
through symbolical identity.
Ultimately, art is a prolongation of
life because it is imbued with a life
of its own.

An art that explains
the universe
by Paul Ahyi
NOTHING in the Negro art of the Benin Coast seems designed
simply to pander to taste or to provide merely fleeting
enjoyment. In this part of the world, the purpose of art is to
express the significance of human life. It is an expression of the
Negro's need to balance the forces within him with phenomena
that are external to his nature as a human being.
To seek the meaning of art in this.region of Africa, one must
"attempt to enter its warm milieu and to penetrate its most
intimate, delicate and secret relationships".
And yet what is often looked for in Negro art is realism,
picturesqueness, odditya tawdry exoticism rather than creati¬
vity in its purest form, originating in man's communion with the
universe.
For a work of art shows man face to face with nature. It is
the artist's response to the external world. It is also the embod¬
iment of knowledge, prescience, divination and magic. Through
the transposition of forms, the serene gravity of movements
and attitudes, Negro art has links, transcending time and place,
with the evocative power of ancient Egyptian, Assyrian and
Pre-Columbian art.
Works of art, whose forms and proportions by no means
correspond to a "natural" perception of things, provide the
Negro with moral and intellectual support. Vehicles for the
acquisition of knowledge, they also express the questions posed
by the universe and the Negro's answers to these questions at
different stages of his history. "They convey ideas, relating the
cosmic and social laws that governed the world at the time of
their creation. Throughout the hundreds or thousands of years
of their existence, these works of art will retain this meaning".
If the Negro artist dissociates and associates natural features
according to his own laws, it is because he seeks to perpetuate
and accentuate what is permanent rather than incidental in living
creatures, the core of their being rather than mere appearances,
the enduring rather than the transient. His aim is to impress on
the mind the reality of the living being and not its outward ¡mage.
In Equatorial Africa, when a Bantu dies, his statue is carved
in wood or some other material. This statue is a representation,
not a likeness. It is a structure which replaces the body from
which life has fled and returned to the earth. In this immortal
"counterpart", the spark of life will henceforward reside. And
if the sculptor decides to enclose this spark in a form different
from that which it originally occupied, it is because he cannot
conceive in his mystical way of thinkingthat the spirit would
wish to re-inhabit a form which it had abandoned out of weariness
or infirmity. Hence, an entirely new creation is called for to
harbour the vital spark.
There is a story, which may well be true, that an explorer
friend of Picasso once told the great master of modern art that
"in Africa, he was curious to see how the Negroes would react
to a photograph. And so he showed them a photo of himself,
dressed in a naval officer's uniform.
"A Negro took it, looked at it from all angles and finally
returned it to him, puzzled. The explorer tried to explain to him
PAUL AHYI is a Togolese writer who currently teaches the plastic arts
at Tokoin high school in Lomé. The text published here has been
adapted from a longer study on The Present Significance of the Cre¬
ative Arts in Africa and their Influence outside Africa, written at
Unesco's request as a working paper for a symposium on Black Civi¬
lization and Education held during the Second World Black and African
Festival of Arts and Cultures (Lagos, Nigeria, 15 Jan. - 12 Feb. 1977).
This bronze head, made in the 13th century A.D.
using the "lost wax" casting process, is an
outstanding example of the art of Ife (Nigeria).
For hundreds of years Ife was an important
cultural centre of the Yoruba people. Since the
magnificent bronze sculptures of classical Ife art
(12th to 15th centuries) were revealed to the world
in 1910, the town has become one of the major
centres of world art.
that the photo was his image. The Negro laughed disbelievingly,
and taking a pencil and paper, set about drawing the officer's
portrait. He drew in his way the head, body, legs and arms in
the style of a Negro idol and handed the drawing to his model.
Then, on second thoughts, he took the drawing back he had
forgotten the shiny buttons on the uniform. He began adding
the buttons to the drawing. But instead of putting them where
they belonged, he set them all around the face".
This anecdote vividly conveys the Negro's attitude towards
the "being". It is a striking example of freedom of expression
and execution in the creative process. For the Negro what
counts is not the outward appearance but the spiritual essence
of the human being. The brass buttons added to the drawing as
an afterthought denote the frippery, the artifice that has only a
remote connexion with man's true worth. They are ornaments
added to life, but they are not part of life.

O talk in proverbs is to invoke
the established order and
the authority of our ancestors.
The expression of a people's in¬
herited wisdom and code of behaviour,
proverbs are often used in traditional
societies as a means of instruction.
A study of such maxims reveals some
of the characteristics and underlying
principles of traditional education and
shows where they coincide and where
they conflict with those of modern
education.
The proverbs presented here are
those of the N'Zema people who live
in the south of the Ivory Coast, in
the region of Grand Lahou, Dabou,
Abidjan and Grand Bassam. Most
of them have a strong similarity to
the proverbs of two other Ivory Coast
peoples, the Agni and the Baoulé,
as well as certain affinities with those
of the Ashanti people of Ghana.
The main educational guidelines
laid down in the proverbs are ad¬
dressed on the one hand to adults
and parents bringing up their children,
and on the other to the children
themselves.
First of all, the proverbs impress
on parents that their children will
reflect themselves. Parents should
never forget that "A bird cannot beget
a mouse", and "Where the needle
goes, the thread follows."
Even when their children are diffi¬
cult, parents must not shirk their
responsibilities. After all, "If you
graze your knee, you can't pretend
that it's not part of your body."
Fortunately, not all children are
rascals. Some of them are favoured
by the gods from the moment they
are born, and, in the words of the
proverb, "A good meal doesn't need
onions or tomatoes."
It goes without saying that a
youngster isn't an adult and that

Africa's
wit and wisdom
children are neither as crafty nor as
quick on the uptake as they some¬
times make themselves out to be.
"A child knows how to run but he
doesn't know how to hide."
Sometimes children try to be too
clever by half and get caught out at
their own game. They do not realize
that "If a child stops his mother
from sleeping, then he won't sleep
either." )
Parents should remember that their
children are growing and changing
all the time. "You don't . take the
food off the fire until it's cooked"
and "You only pick palm-nuts when
they're ripe." But children will grow
up in time. "A dry coconut won't
stay on the tree forever." (In other
words, when the coconut is well and
truly ripe, it will drop unaided from
the tree.)
Children react to things in different
ways and so education should be
adapted to suit the character of each
child. "You don't put all animals
on a leash", says one proverb, while
according to another, "The dung
beetle says there are many ways of
carrying a load." (Some carry it on
their head, others on their back. As
for the dung beetle, he rolls it along
walking backwards.)
Children must be trusted, espe¬
cially if they really set their minds
on doing something: "A child who
wants to set his trap on a rock knows
where to put the snare."
Never give up hope where a young¬
ster is concerned. "If a cluster of
palm nuts drops from the tree and he
doesn't pick them up, then he'll pick
up the dead leaves."
If parents treat their children with
respect, then so will other people:
"If you kick your dog, the others will
give it a beating."
But still, a firm hand is necessary,
since "You don't rear a cock for it to
perch on your head and crow."
Means must be adapted to ends.
"You don't need a knife to eat an
egg", and "When the journey is short,
you don't rest on the way." And
again, "If you dig the grasshopper's
hole with a log, you'll block it up."
At the same time, adults should be
tolerant, and sometimes even turn
a blind eye when their children get
up to mischief.
It is best to let a child learn his
own lessons, so that he can find out
for himself what he needs to know.
Nothing can beat practical experience.
"Sweetness is enjoyed in the mouth",
goes the proverb. Sometimes it
may be advisable to let a child do
something even if he regrets it later
on. "The road doesn't say a word to
anyone." In other words it doesn't
tell travellers what has happened to
those who went before them; every¬
one must learn his own lessons.
The same idea is found in another
proverb: "It's only when you've
spilled the oil that you know where
you should have stored it."
In some cases children should be
given a helping hand when they insist
on doing something. One proverb
is quite categorical about this: "If
the child cries for the arrow you've
snatched from his hands so that he
wouldn't prick his finger, then sharpen
the point and give it him back."
Everyone has the, right to find out
for himself.
Grown-ups should help a child,
but never put themselves in his place.
"The child's share of cooked yam has
been cleaned and given to him",
goes the proverb, "but it's up to him
whether he eats it or not. We're
certainly not going to eat it for him."
Children must respect society's
institutions and the established order.
A youngster who remains attached
to his mother and his society won't
go far wrong. "The chicken that
follows its mother is the one that
eats the cockroach's paw." Contrari¬
wise, it's risky to keep out of social
life. "He who loses his father loses
his protection", says one proverb.
Others take up the same theme:
"The child who can't stand living
with his mother will end his days
on the skin of a black monkey" (in
other words, abandoned and without
a grave). "If your father and mother I

to ancient units of weight based on the seeds
of certain plants, they were made in a variety
of forms: human figures, animals, musical
instruments and weapons. They speak a language

Even when their esoteric significance is not fully

of humour and vivacity.
Unhappy landing
Its fins bristling, a caught
catfish takes stock of dry
land. With round bulbous
eyes it gapes at the cooking
pot and wonders how it is
going to be served up.
It has no say in the matter;
it has ceased to be master
of its fate. Moral: when the
game's up, give in gracefully,
however much pride you have
to swallow.
> give you advice and you don't listen,
then the tree-stumps on the road will
teach you a lesson or two." (In other
words, the ups and downs of life will
teach you how to live.) Another
proverb refers approvingly to the
child who accepts his society and is
accepted by society in his turn: "The
child who knows how to wash his
hands eats with the adults."
Society, like a mother, wants no¬
thing but good for its members, even
when it imposes restrictions on them.
After all, "The mother hen's claw
doesn't crush her pullet."
A number of N'Zema proverbs
stress the importance of respecting
existing institutions, the hierarchy,
and the time-honoured order of
things. Girls should be told what
is expected of their mothers: "The
hen knows when it's dawn, but it's
the rooster that crows." "As long as
you've got a head on your shoulders,
your knee doesn't wear a hat" and
"The chicken may get fat but he's
still a bird." "If a child's got good
lungs, he'll blow the trumpet but he
can't blow the chaff from the mortar."
He should know the natural order
of things: "The child doesn't break
the turtle-shell, he cracks the shell of
the snail." (He isn't strong enough
to break a turtle-shell and no one
expects him to be.)
The members of the community
should stick together and help each
other out, since "The right hand
washes the left hand and the left
hand washes the right hand", and
"It's the ear that hears the good news
about the healing medicine, but it's
the hand that takes it." Solidarity
and mutual assistance should prevail,
not only between children but also
between parents and children, bet¬
ween young and old. The proverb
declares that "The old man's hand
won't go through the narrow neck
of the jug, but the child's hand can't
reach the top of the food dryer."
At the same time people should
always a keep a cool head and know
when to act on their own initiative
when necessary: "The Azié monkey
says that we receive life one at a
time." (In other words, we are
born alone and we die alone, and so
we should avoid following the crowd
heedlessly.) "If raw meat is taboo
for you, then don't make friends
with the panther."
Everyone is responsible for his
own actions, and woe betide anyone
who tries to wriggle out of respon¬
sibility on the grounds that he is a
victim of heredity or because he
happened to be born on a certain
day. "Assuan says he doesn't get
on in life because he was born at
night." Success comes from hard
work: in the words of one proverb,
"The salt you beg will never season
a meal." If people work hard for
themselves, they won't be hamstrung
by having to rely on other people. A
man who depends on others is like a
blind man, and "The blind man doesn't
lose his temper in the middle of the
forest."
People should always persevere
and ignore risks and setbacks, re-

The back-stabber
Once upon a time,
the scorpion was a symbol
of good fortune; today it brings
bad luck. It has turned from
a faithful friend into
a remorseless enemy.
The message of the scorpion
is a warning to those
who would never dream that
a childhood friend could
betray them: "Beware."
(Brass weight from the
Ivory Coast)
membering the proverb that "As long
as your pursuer doesn't say he's tired,
don't you say that you are."
It is essential to look before you
leap, to know your own possibilities
and limitations and act accordingly.
"When the animals get together be¬
fore leaving, the tortoise has already
gone on ahead."
Though personal experience paves
the way to knowledge and success,
the wise man knows that some forms
of experience are futile and even dan¬
gerous. "You don't push an old man
to see where he will fall" and "Even
if you're tough you don't jump and
hurl yourself against a rock."
It is clear that these educational
maxims are deeply rooted in the way
of life of the societies which formu¬
lated them. Social life and the
structure of society also seem to
influence the theory of knowledge.
But what is the purpose of knowledge?
The purpose of knowledge is to
understand everything that has any
bearing whatever on mankind, whose
value is supreme: "Man", says the
proverb, "is superior to gold."
The fount of all knowledge is expe¬
rience, and the best experience is
that which is acquired slowly, over
the years. Experience is the touch¬
stone which tests the validity of
knowledge, and if a child can never
know as much as an adult it is pre¬
cisely because of his lack of expe¬
rience. ("He knows how to run but
not how to hide.") If he claims to
know it all, then he should be brought
down to earth. "When you were
born you didn't see how your mother
was decked out in her bridal clothes
to be taken to her husband."
It is in real life that we can see how
these proverbs are reflected in educa¬
tional principles. Education comes
from coping with situations as they
arise; there are no formal lessons in
morality or the civic virtues. Mis¬
behaviour is corrected as and when
it occurs. Children must prove them¬
selves though contact with their
playmates and with adults, picking
up what life has to teach them and
absorbing the ¡deals of the community
in which they live.
It can be said that some of the
principles which modern education
proudly claims to have discovered
or rediscovered have always been
unobtrusively observed in traditional
societies.
For example, when a school encou¬
rages a child from a traditional village
background to be self-reliant and to
use his own initiative, it is teaching
him qualities which his parents have
already begun to expect of him.
When a school teaches a child that
co-operation is a virtue, it in no way
contradicts values inculcated by
traditional education.
Of course, schools provide a syste¬
matic education, whereas education
in the traditional society is usually
less methodical. Theoretically, then,
a child who has attended school
ought simply to have fuller, more
precise and more systematic know¬
ledge than one who has had no
schooling.
In practice, however, certain con¬
flicts arise between traditional and
modern forms of education. The
fundamental divergence lies in the
fact that modern education tends to
develop a critical approach and to
call established values into question.
And so problems arise when children
pass from one system to another.
When parents in traditional village
society discover that their children,
in whom they have always inculcated
respect for the old, for the natural
order of things and for time-honoured
beliefs, have learned at school patterns
of behaviour which lead them to
question and challenge everything,
they inevitably feel disappointed.
They consider that schooling has
corrupted their children.
It also happens that children,
seeing their parents still attached
to traditional values, feel that they
are old-fashioned and find it hard to
fall back into step with them.
The conflict facing most school¬
children stems largely from a contra¬
diction between respect for existing
institutions and the established order,
which social stability demands, and
the critical approach and the ques¬
tioning of values, which are neces¬
sary in a constantly changing society.

MUSIC to an African is not a
luxury but a way of living.
It expresses his happiness
and jubilation at weddings and festivals,
his pride and sophistication on cere¬
monial occasions, his loneliness and
devotion at religious rituals, his inten¬
sity in love, his might at work, his
simplicity and humility by his fireside
and his courage in war.
African folk music is thus a living
example of the African cultural heri¬
tage. It has matured over thousands
of years and is based on beliefs es¬
tablished by ancient customs and
practices. Though mostly unexpres¬
sed in words, these beliefs are known
and understood by every member of
the culture to which the artist belongs.
But although music is intricately
woven into the fabric of African social
and spiritual life, its significance has,
unfortunately, so far only been dimly
realized.
Western musicians, unlike their
African counterparts, inherit a long
tradition of musical literacy. They
can experience their art with detach¬
ment and objectivity. They can re¬
move music from its context and treat
it as something that exists of itself.
The Western concept that musical
sound creates emotion is due to this
long-established musical literacy. Con¬
sequently, ideas such as that whereby
a minor key is "sad" are established
aesthetics of Western musical art.
African music, on the other hand,
has a set of social and cultural asso¬
ciations and cannot be abstracted
from its context. It is difficult to
dissociate the impact of musical sound
from the effects of such associations
on the emotions.
I once played a tape of their peo¬
ple's songs and epic recitations to a
group of herdsmen living around the
lakes of western Uganda. The songs
and recitations touched on the life of
one of their legendary heroes. Only
two listeners were moved to tears.
The rest remained unmoved because
the music was being played outside
its ritual context.
African music uses strictly regulated
and stylized sounds to express
thoughts and perceptions related to a
particular ritual or function, thus
transforming it to a new plane of
experience and heightening our en¬
joyment and perception of it.
Through the invocation of ancestral
spirits it provides a medium between
the living and the dead, but it is also
used to accompany oral history, story¬
telling, speech-making and various
forms of poetic recitations. Genealo¬
gies, proverbs and legends are also
portrayed through music, which ¡s a
vehicle for the preservation and disse¬
mination of knowledge and thus for
education.
The significance of music in African
life is further illustrated by the role it
plays in traditional occupations and
activities. Music is present at every
stage of the farmer's year, from the
bush clearing which precedes plough¬
ing and planting to harvest time,
threshing and the carrying of the

crops. Work and leisure activities
such as fishing, hunting, brewing and
cultivating, often take place to the
accompaniment of music.
In Africa there is music for every
season of a man's life. There is music
for birth, for infancy and puberty, for
adulthood and weddings, for funerals
and for succession after death. The
traditions surrounding the birth of a
child, which begin before the actual
delivery with the seeking of a diviner's
message regarding the baby's safe
arrival, are communicated through
music and dance.
Thus, the Banyoro people of Uganda
have a special three-part ritual dedi¬
cated to Rubanga, the god of twins,
in which the birth is celebrated by
singing and dancing in which the
parents themselves take part.
African childhood is accompanied
by a wealth of dance songs, play
songs, story songs and musical k
games of all kinds. Before the advent f

of modern schooling, children were
mostly left to themselves, and these
musical pastimes had their own in¬
herent educational values and creati-
veness. Through songs such as the
"counting out" song performed by
Banyankole children, infants learn not
only how to count but also train their
ear to listen to the accents of musical
beats.
Puberty, among several African
ethnic groups, is a momentous occa¬
sion marked by circumcision music,
dancing and visual art in the form of
masques and body painting. It is
through the initiation rites performed
at puberty that systematic instruction
is given to the young, designed to
help them to pass from childhood to
manhood and to transmit to them the
customs and ideals which are consi¬
dered important for the continued
welfare of their community.
Among several ethnic groups of
East Africa, wedding ceremonies are
rituals which amount to folk operas of
immense variety and intense dramatic
and musical content.
A typical wedding ceremony of the
Bantu-speaking Bahaya people of
Tanzania is a highly structured per¬
formance which begins with motherly
advice to the bride presented in ope¬
ratic style with recitatives interspersed
with arias. The beauty of the bride,
her wedding dress and the institution
of marriage itself are praised, the per¬
formance being punctuated with reci¬
tations of her genealogy.
The ceremony ends with a tri¬
umphant procession in which men
sent by the bridegroom's parents
carry her to her new home. Here the
celebrations reach their climax in exu¬
berant scenes of music and dancing,
while love poems are declaimed inside
the bridegroom's house to the ac¬
companiment of soft music played on
a zither.
Death in African society is the oc¬
casion for music of poignancy and
sadness which accompanies the fune¬
ral rites. In contrast to this are the
joyful musical and dance-rituals with
which some African peoples celebrate
the succession of an heir. In one
such ceremony practised by the Ba-
ganda people of Uganda, the sad and
contemplative music of a ritual known
as the "Okabya Olumbe" (literally,
the "destruction of death") is follow¬
ed by a joyful ceremony of welcome
to the heir or successor, against a
background of drum beats which
identify the clan and symbolize its
continuity.
Thus folk music is present in Afri¬
can life from the cradle to the grave,
a living part of a culture which trans¬
cends and transforms everyday expe¬
rience.

In search of
a new African
theatre
by Demas Nwoko
AN accident of history has made
us Africans a curious people.
Our formal education began
with the learning of things foreign to
our culture in every branch of pro¬
fessional training medicine, agricul¬
ture, language, history, geography,
and even in crafts like pottery, smith-
ery and weaving. The result for the
young African artist ¡s a confusion
that breeds in him an inferiority
complex.
Modern African schools of drama
teach theatre history, dramatic liter¬
ature, speech and movement, dance,
design and play production. Drama
students are confronted with plays
written by authors ranging from the
Greeks to modern writers like Ionesco,
Pinter or Kafka.
Dance, design and production work¬
shops offer practical courses which
are important in the training of a
theatre artist, but these aspects of the
theatre are mostly taught through
books, which tend to deal with them
in academic rather than practical
terms.
The whole atmosphere is charged
with books and much emphasis is
placed on written examinations, so
that the students lose interest in the
practical aspects. They work so hard
to understand these text books that
frustration and exhaustion take away
any incentive to create spontaneous¬
ly. This is to be expected since cre¬
ativity is more a matter of intuition
than knowledge.
African artists of today seek free¬
dom to create their own art and cul¬
ture, to borrow from wherever they
wish and to do anything they like
with what they borrow; above all
they seek freedom to be the sole
judge of the validity of their living
culture.
DEMAS NWOKO, Nigerian artist and author,
has written a number of studies on the place
of modern theatre in African life and culture.
The training of the young African
artist should be based on teaching in
the classical art forms of Africa.
Once they have matured in their own
culture, all artists will pick up what¬
ever influences they choose from any
corner of the globe. I see this as the
only sane beginning for any African
art.
To achieve this, our schools of art
and theatre should be practical pro¬
fessional workshops and studio
schools, outside the universities.
I would advocate the re-establish¬
ment of the old apprenticeship system.
Actors as well as all other theatre
artists should learn their craft in thea¬
tre studios run by theatre directors.
Many spirited attempts have been
made in the past and are still being
made today to evolve an African
theatre idiom. Though no formal
philosophy has been propounded we
all agree that a truly African identity
in art is imperative. It is also com¬
monly held that this new art should
neither ape European art nor be a
mere copy of traditional African art.
When we talk of a modern African
theatre, I should like us to think of a
culture that belongs to the new
African society, concentrated mostly
in the cities and towns.
Artistically speaking, traditional Afri¬
can society worked almost always in
tribal enclaves and this was obviously
due to the poor communications that
existed in former times. Over a long
period, tribes developed theatrical
expressions unique to them, to such
an extent that scholars subsequently
tended to accept these differences as
cultural distinctions between African
tribes. Even Africans themselves are
generally surprised to see a person of
a different tribe perform a dance of
their tribe fairly well.
There is almost a belief that tribal
artistic expressions have their origins
in the customs and philosophy of the
tribe and often acquire a religious
colouring in the process. Once this
process is completed, the art is seen
as theirs alone and any outsider, i.e.
anyone immediately outside the clan,
is not expected to understand it easily.
Today, -however, the new African
society is detribalized. It is nationalis¬
tic now and will eventually become
Pan-Africanistic, as political unity is
achieved.
The artistic expression of one tribe
cannot fulfil the aesthetic needs of
this multi-tribal society. There has to
be a marriage of artistic habits, and
this is accomplished naturally as the
society comes to share the same reli¬
gions, work and play. The duty of
the artists of this new society will be
to create an art that will express the
life and aspirations of this new
"supertribe".
By virtue of its structure, the new
African society, which is characteriz¬
ed by basically classless social habits,
holds great promise for the growth of
a people's theatre. To achieve this
most desirable end, dramatists should
work with the people in mind at all
times.
Any attitude that tends to empha¬
size distinction in status, or which
creates exclusive tastes in theatrical
entertainment, should be avoided. In
the framework of our present-day
society, any expression of the peo¬
ple's soul will be successfully African
and can become very popular.
It is always wrongly generalized that
an art that is popular is vulgar and
that fine art is always exclusive.
Traditional African arts have shown
that every human being is capable of
appreciating and enjoying the fine
arts, be he king or slave, master or
servant.
To preserve this heritage, any artist
who purposely confines his talent to
a single section of our society should
not be encouraged with public pa¬
tronage, as there is a possible trace of
class patronage in him. Everybody
might not be able to buy the most
highly-priced seats in a theatre, but
all should be able to enjoy a play,
deriving a common aesthetic satisfac¬
tion based on a common philosophy
of life.
The most important thing on the
stage should be man, and not the
events he is enacting; neither should
the objects around nor the tech¬
nological trappings of the modern
stage distract attention from him. We
should not seek to achieve mathema¬
tical precision and speed to the detri¬
ment of the full development and
exposition of the art of the living
artist on stage.
Realism as it is known in Western
theatre appears vulgar to African
audiences, which react to it with
laughter that is not the laughter of an
amused person, but the chuckle of an
adult at the ineffectiveness of a child¬
ish prank.

The awakening
African cinema
by Francis Bebey
AS far as the general public is
concerned, it may well be
that the cinema is more high¬
ly appreciated than anything else that
the West has brought to Africa.
From Niger to Botswana, from An¬
gola to Tanzania, people flock to film
shows, and every country boasts a
great many cinemas, most of them
in the towns.
These cinemas undoubtedly play a
part in keeping people who for va¬
rious reasons have moved to the
towns from returning to the villages
where they were born.
This makes the cinemachalleng¬
ed as a form of entertainment only
by football an important factor in
African society, and one that can in
certain circumstances have a major
impact on a country's economy. Since
most of these economies are predo¬
minantly agricultural, the rural exodus
which the cinema directly or indirectly
encourages is a matter whose impor¬
tance cannot be ignored.
I have often asked young Africans
why they insist on staying in the
towns, where they have no useful
occupation, instead of returning to
their villages where they would be
FRANCIS BEBEY, musician, novelist and
poet of Cameroon, is founder and director of
Ozileka, a record publishing house producing
records for Africa. Composer and guitarist,
he has given recitals of his compositions in
many countries, and has made several records,
the latest of which. Condition Masculine, is
published by Ozileka. He is also the author of
a book of initiation into the traditional music
of Black Africa, African Music: A People's
Art (Hill,' Lawrence and Co., New York, 1975).
In 1968 he was awarded the Grand Prix Litté¬
raire de l'Afrique Noire for his novel Le Fils
d'Agatha Moudio ("Agatha Moudio's Son",
Hutchinson, London, 1973). For ten years he
was associated with Unesco's programme for
the development of broadcasting in Africa.
happier. All too often these young
villagers mention the cinema as an
urban attraction which they find hard
to resist.
At this point it is perhaps worth
pausing to define exactly what we
mean when we talk about the cinema
in Black Africa. Basically, of course,
the African cinema is much the same
as in the West: a darkened room, a
screen, a projector, a film being pro¬
jected, and an audience watching the
film.
Often, though, the darkened room
is simply an open-air enclosure with
concrete terraces for seats. The
screen is open to the weather and
not always ideal for a satisfactory
projection. The projector is liable to
be a noisy old machine and the film
a "western" of doubtful taste. As
for the audience, its spontaneous in¬
volvement in the proceedings may
sometimes be a little disconcerting.
To be fair, things are not always
thus, and in the big cities such as
Dakar, Nairobi, Lagos or Bukavu the'
cinemas are air-conditioned and every
bit as comfortable as those in Europe
or America, with the most up-to-date
equipment. These cinemas generally
cater to a relatively well-off public,
offering programmes of perfectly res¬
pectable intellectual, cultural and
artistic credentials.
Open-air cinemas, which are found
in many countries of the African sa¬
vannah and in some towns of the
forest regions, cost little to build and
the running expenses are practically
nil. They are pretty uncomfortable for
the "ordinary" members of the public,
but they nearly always have three or
four rows of covered seats on a raised
dais at the back for the more impor¬
tant Africans in the audience or for
Europeans should they ever venture
into these "cinemas for Africans".
For many teenagers and poor adults,
these open-air cinemas are a godsend,
especially when there are a few trees
nearby. It is an easy matter to climb
up onto a stout branch and enjoy an
excellent view of the screen.
So cinema audiences in Black Africa
are socially stratified and could in
themselves provide the subject for an
interesting sociological study. Depend¬
ing on the kind of cinema and the
neighbourhood in which it is situated,
the price of a ticket may vary between
the equivalent of 25 cents and $ 6.
Most cinemas belong to non-Afri¬
cans or to chains set up by European
or American distributors. For several
decades, two French firms owned and
ran a network of over 300 cinemas
in the French-speaking part of Africa.
The situation is no longer quite the
same. A Tunisian journalist, Tahar
Cheriaa, writing in the weekly maga¬
zine Algérie-Actualités in January 1972,
reported that 33 of these cinemas
had been nationalized by State bodies
following independence; that 83 now
belonged to private individuals, al¬
though their programmes were still
provided by non-African companies;
and that 200 or so still belonged to
the two companies.
But although the situation today is
no longer what it was 15 years ago,
the changes that have occurred do not
seem to have brought about a genuine
assumption of control, over distribution
by African governments. In the En¬
glish-speaking countries the circuits
set up by the British, and the arrival
of American companies on the market
are a matter of concern to government
leaders and officials responsible for
African cinema.
The fact is that these companies,
which have enjoyed a monopoly over
film-distribution in Black Africa ever
since the beginning, are at the root
of the appalling state of the cinema k
on the African continent. r

of film to be shown to the public. As
a result, African film-goers are offered
a diet of European duds, third-rate
American westerns and Egyptian or
Indian films so bad they could never
hope for a showing in Europe or
America.
THIS widespread distribution of
poor-quality films has at least
two tragic consequences: it
develops and nurtures uncritical taste
on the part of the public while at the
same time leaving scant room for the
development of Africa's own potential
already existingfilm-making
creativity.
In addition, it misleads many film-
goers into thinking that the cinema-
fiction served up to them is in fact
reality, and into accepting uncritically
everything they see on the screen.
The public thronging the cheap ci¬
nemas in the poorest districts, in other
words the vast majority of African
film-goers, is in such thrall to the ci¬
nema that the dangers underlying the
kind of unscrupulous programming
imposed by the existing distributors
are all too apparent.
The fact that audience participation
does not stem from any profound
reflexion means that "lessons" learn¬
ed from the cinema screen are often
put into practice in real life. For ex¬
ample, certain African towns expe¬
rience periodic outbreaks of lawless¬
ness following a spate of films glorify¬
ing outlaws and gangsters.
The trouble is, this kind of film
makes up the bulk of Western cine¬
ma's contribution to Black Africa; the
great films of the international cinema
are a rarity. True, in some parts
Charlie Chaplin is as familiar a figure
as Tarzan. Still, on the whole, and
certain improvements in programmes
over the past few years notwithstand¬
ing, the African cinema-going public
continues to be overwhelmed by ar¬
tistically stultifying and morally re¬
prehensible films.
African film-making as such has ex¬
panded over the past 15 years, but
it is handicapped not only by a lack
of financial resources, not only by
obstacles placed in its way by the dis¬
tributors, but also by the attitude of
the public, trained as it is in the school
of poor taste rather than that of
thoughtful scrutiny.
When someone like Ousmane Sem¬
bène suggests a moment's reflection
about some aspect of society, as in
his films Mandabi or La Noire de...,
(Black Girl) he is by no means sure of
having the African public on his side.
"What kind of a film is this, it doesn't
feature any of our favourite blood-
and-thunder heroes?" think some,
while others mutter, "What on earth
does he think he's up to, showing us
all the most commonplace aspects of
our daily lives?"
After all, it is understandable enough
that African film-goers, as avid for
exoticism as their counterparts the
world over, should have little time for
scenes of everyday life taken from all
around them. But the problem goes
deeper still: for all too long the African
public has been encouraged to think
about anything but its own condition.
This encouragement, which was an
integral part of colonialism, has not
altogether vanished with the advent
of independence.
Little has been done to combat the
foreign distributors' monopoly, to
create new circuits or to bring to a
wider public films capable of helping
Africans along the road to intellectual,
cultural and moral emancipation. One
even begins to wonder whether this
misuse of cinema is not at least part¬
ly responsible for the misfortunes of
Black Africa today.
Despite all this, the past 15 years
have seen the growth of an African
cinema worthy of the name. Some
people have seen its output as a new
form of modern African literature; at
any rate, it has included a number of
films condemning colonialism, and
others dealing with the struggle
against neo-colonialism, with mistakes
made in the early days of indepen¬
dence, with the position of women
in African society and with what Guy
Hennebelle has called the "new black
slave trade" in his book Les cinémas
africains (African cinemas; published
by the Société Africaine d'Edition,
Dakar, 1972).
The development of an African
cinema has had a number of conse¬
quences, including the foundation of
the Panafrican Cinema Federation,
which has fostered African partici¬
pation in various festivals (such as
the Carthage Film Festival), and which
is also partly responsible for the found¬
ing of the Ouagadougou Festival.
These subjects have already inspir¬
ed a great many films, but certain
names stand out from the crowd.
The Senegalese writer and film-maker
Ousmane Sembène is undoubtedly
the best-known African film-director
at the present time. With La Noire
de..., Mandabi, Taw, Emitai and
Xa/a, all of which are good films
aesthetically, ethically and technically,
Ousmane Sembène has brought the
Senegalese film industry to the fore¬
front of Black African cinema.
His films draw their inspiration from
everyday African in this case Sene¬
galese revealing its charm and
its poetry while at the same time re¬
flecting deeply on the human condition
in Africa. This film-maker, who is in
many ways a model for contempo¬
rary Africa, has already received nu¬
merous prizes and awards for his
work.
Med Ondo of Mauritania (Soleil O
in particular); Paulin Soumanou Viey-
ra, a pioneer of Senegalese cinema;
Mahama Traoré, better known as
Johnson Traoré (Diegue-bi and Njdjan-
gan), another Senegalese film-maker,
have, along with Babacar Samb-
Makharam (Kodou) and others, also
played an active part in the burgeon¬
ing of African cinema.
The Ivory Coast is represented by
Désiré Ecaré (Concerto pour un Exil)
and A nous deux, France), Bassori
Timité (La Dune de la Solitude and
La Femme au Couteau) and Henri
Duparc (Mouna, ou le rêve d'un Ar¬
tiste). However, unlike Senegal,
where one really can speak in terms
of a "national school" of film-making
due to the relatively large number of
film-makers at work, in the Ivory
Coast, these artists are isolated
creators.
Mustapha Alassane (Le Retour d'un
Aventurier, Le Téléphoniste, etc.)
and Oumarou Ganda (Cabascabo)
from Niger, Daniel Kamwa (Pousse-
Pousse and Boubou-Cravate) and
Dikongué Pipa (Moun'a Moto), both
from Cameroon, round up this brief,
but by no means exhaustive list of
the better-known French-speaking
African film-makers.
Turning now to the English-speak¬
ing countries, it is too early to speak
of the birth of a genuinely African
cinema, although Bernard Odidja of
Ghana (Doing Their Thing), Egbert
Adjesu, another Ghanaian (I Told
You So) and particularly the Nigerian
Ola Balogun (Alpha, Aj'ani Ogun,
etc.) all deserve mention.
Ola Balogun is both film-maker and
theoretician. Speaking of African ci¬
nema's development possibilities he
points out that in many countries
cinema audiences are too small for
receipts to be able to finance a "con¬
ventional" cinema industry. "How¬
ever, we may regard the economic
problem as more apparent than real,
since a reorganization of structures
32

coupled with judicious planning ought
to make it possible to resolve it."
(See article page 12.)
He believes that one solution that
might permit the development of film
production in Black Africa might lie
in cooperation between the African
States themselves, especially through
the pooling of technical and financial
resources, and through the adoption
by African film-makers of new types
of equipment especially lightweight
material. Traditional 35 mm cameras
could be replaced by 16 mm ones,
and production crews could be pared
down to a minimum, all of which
would naturally help to cut film-pro¬
duction costs.
This view, expressed by a film¬
maker thoroughly familiar with the
problems of his craft, which he pract¬
ises in Africa itself at the present
time, deserves to be borne in mind
by all concerned with the growth of
African cinema: film producers them¬
selves, but also cinema managers
and operators, Ministries of Culture
and the Arts, the teaching profession
as well as other bodies concerned
with education.
ONE thing is certain, namely that
at a time when the rich na¬
tions are dropping methods
and techniques that have come to be
regarded as outmoded; at a time when
Hollywood is abandoning its studios
in favour of shooting on location with
increasingly compact production crews,
African film-makers would be well-
advised to reassess their art and to
adopt a more realistic approach to
production than they have done in
the past.
In my opinion, the only kind of
equipment which is really suited to
economic conditions in Africa is nei¬
ther 35 mm nor 16 mm, but the cheap¬
est of them all. Super 8 mm. For
the moment, most "self-respecting"
professionals will have nothing to do
with this format; and yet it alone is
capable of making films serve the
cause of development education in
Black Africa.
Francis Bebey
In search
of a new African theatre
continued from page 29
They might well be asking "Why
cry on stage when we know you are
not grieved or hurt? Why stab some¬
one to death when we know his life
is in no danger of death? Why kiss
and caress on stage when you are not
lovers?" They cannot help laughing
when a "dead" man rises at curtain
call to take a bow.
While the European is prepared to
suspend his disbelief, and to consider
that what is happening on stage is
"reality", the African prefers to see a
performance as an artistic display.
In order to achieve the desired purity
in art, aesthetically ugly manifesta¬
tions like quarrels, which create
abusive language and physical con¬
frontations in fights, cruelty which
results in killing, and other types of
death, are enacted in a highly stylized
manner.
What is true of the acting holds
also for design. The African does not
expect to see a house on stage, nor
does he expect to see a real car, a
king's crown or even a real police¬
man's uniform. A theatrical represen¬
tation of these things is all he expects,
and this is how it should be in the
theatre.
The theatre is first and foremost a
visual expression using sound in mu¬
sic, song or speech; movement, walk¬
ed or danced; designs, colour, shapes
in two or three dimensions, static or
in motion; and a text to build up
associations with the world of nature.
Valid theatre can exist without a text,
while a text without visual expression
can only become literature and never
theatre.
In the new African theatre, there¬
fore, the director should be a good
dancer and choreographer and, along
with these accomplishments, he
should have developed an ear for
music. He should have become so
conversant with shape and the use
of space that he can decide the shapes
of costumes and props that will
ensure their practicality.
While he should not necessarily
write the text of his scripts, he
should choose only poems or writings
that fit into his style of production
since, in this theatre, the visual form
comes before the text in importance.
The true African dramatist will grow
with the African theatre, working
directly for a director or a style when
one has been successfully established.
As regards the ever-present question
of the synthesis of African and West¬
ern cultures as they are found in our
lives, we must accept that a lot of
Western values have come to stay.
We will always have much more of
the European in us (especially with
the mass education programme in
hand) than the European will ever
have of our culture.
A few of us might appear quite at
ease in both cultures; but do not be
deceivedwe are merely very good
actors and mimics, and it works well
for surface fun. Under this apparent
easy adaptability lies only one person¬
ality, that of the African who must be
saved from his cultural ordeal.
Whereas the African religion failed
in the face of the Christian Church
and Islam, art is more fortunate and
has become Africa's pride in the
world today. So it seems that it is
the artist whose duty it is to restore
the new African into a wholesome
personality, by making his culture
dominate his material life.
African culture is not incompatible
with the material, purely technical and
economic aspects of Western civiliza¬
tion. African culture can effectively
make use of modern technology for
its realization and dissemination on
the scale demanded by the world to¬
day, without dehumanizing its values.
Western art today is not only com¬
pletely dehumanized, but it is fashion¬
ed for the glorification of man-made
things, indicating man's sell-out to his
machines. We have as yet no ma¬
chines to sell our souls to and I think
it would a little undignified of the
African to enslave himself to another
man's machines. Let us build our
own modern, human civilization first,
and then decay in our own good
time.

Unesco meeting in Florence
on world information problems
About a hundred journalists (includ¬
ing newspaper editors, directors of
news agencies, and radio and TV
broadcasters) and representatives of
information services met in Florence
from 18 to 20 April 1977, at Unesco's
invitation, to discuss problems relating
to the international flow of information.
The participants noted , the existence
of an imbalance in the exchange, of
information between developing and
industrialized countries and agreed
on the need for considerable efforts to
remedy this imbalance. In spite of
the diversity of views expressed, there
was agreement on the importance of
the problem and on the need for a free
and balanced flow of information with
a view to international understanding,
justice, peace and the intellectual
enrichment of mankind.
The participants expressed the wish
that Unesco should continue its efforts
and studies in order to achieve con¬
crete results, taking into consideration
all that had been said at the meeting.
In an opening address, Mr. Jacques
Rigaud, Assistant Director-General of
Unesco, pointed out that Unesco's
sole aim in initiating the meeting was
to enrich and diversify a process of
reflectionin which it was Unesco's
duty to involve world opinionon a
problem on which peace and develop¬
ment ultimately depend. Mr. Rigaud
added, "It is for each country... to
define its own communication policy
in the light of its own options, situation
and needs."

U.S. $ 1 million donation
to save Philae
The United States has decided to
donate a further $ 1 million to the
Unesco-sponsored international cam¬
paign to save the monuments of the
island of Philae in . the Nile Valley.
The temples on the island, which is
now permanently submerged in the
waters of the lake created by the
Aswan High Dam, have been disman¬
tled and transported to the nearby
island of Agilkia where they are now
being re-erected. Total contributions
paid or pledged by the international
community to save the Philae monu¬
ments now stand at $12,375,000.
Bulgaria's gift
to 'Save Acropolis' fund
Following the appeal made in Ja¬
nuary by Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow,
Director-General of Unesco, for sup¬
port for an international campaign to
safeguard the Acropolis, the People's
Republic of Bulgaria has paid the
equivalent of $ 25,000 into the cam¬
paign's international fund. A Bulga¬
rian committee of specialists has been
set up to give financial and technical
support to the campaign.
Bilingual development lexicon
An English-French International De¬
velopment Lexicon has recently been

Flashes...
The Republic of the Comoros became
Unesco's 142nd. Member State on
22 March 1977.
According to world book production
figures in Unesco's Statistical Yearbook,
a total of 571,000 titles were published
in 1974. This output was very unevenly
distributed: 48.3% were published in
Europe, 1 6.8% in North America, 14.5%
in Asia, 14 % in U.S.S.R., 3.5% in South
America, 1.9% in Africa, and 0.9% in
Oceania.
M A Unesco survey of water resources in
800,000 km1 of northern Algeria and
Tunisia has shown that the area has
enough water to guarantee the agricul¬
tural development of an additional 50,000
to 100,000 hectares.
Total agricultural production in 1976
showed a rise of more than 3 per cent
over 1975, according to preliminary esti¬
mates by FAO.
