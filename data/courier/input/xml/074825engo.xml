Goddess of harvests
Discovered in Turkmenistan (U.S.S.R.) in 1974, this unusual statuette (40 cms high) represents a
goddess of fertility. It dates back to the time, some 4,000 years ago, when a flourishing civiliza¬
tion stretched from the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea to the southern edge of the Karakum
desert, a region spanning Turkmenistan's present-day border with Iran. The fertility goddess was
highly revered in this farming civilization, whose origins go back to the 4th millenium B.C.

This issue ot the "Unesco

a crucial world problem:
the human ' habitat and
quality of life. A global
inquiry into this problem
is being made . by the
United Nations Confe¬
rence on Human Settle¬

couver (Canada) from 31 May to 11 June 1976. Our front cover reproduces
a painting by the Austrian artist Hundertwasser, representing a garden-
dwelling. Its suggestion of harmony and well-being is recalled in another
context by our back cover photo of the garden village of Bröndby, near
Copenhagen (Denmark). Opened in 1964, it was created by the Danish
architect and landscape designer Erik Mygind.

DESIRES create their ownspace:
a musician sees a concert hall;
a pilot dreams of a clear sky and a

The quest for happiness almost al¬

Rare are the human beings who can
find an environment which reflects this
¡deal, and still rarer are those who are
able to live in it.
Those who have either money or
power or both are quite happy to be
privileged; they enjoy their spacious
apartments in the best parts of town,
their country houses and seaside
villas.
But as nothing In this world is per¬
fect, the best parts of town are some¬

the famous lines from Baudelaire's
L'Invitation au Voyage:
Là, tout n'est qu'ordre et beauté,
luxe, calme et volupté (1).
Yet this ¡s precisely what the quality
of the environment ought to mean.
Most people are not so demanding,
even If they consider, not unreason¬
ably, that they too deserve their share
of ordre and beauté. They are housed,
whether well or badly, they have a
job and play their part in production
and society. On the subject of their

They are dependent on the tyranny of

pollution, fragmented like the times
they live in.
Now some are beginning to ques¬
tion the political and economic struc¬
tures of the system which Is respon¬
sible for the lives they are forced to
lead, but more often they simply ac¬
cept them without imagining that there
could be an alternative. Some people
are used to living where they were
born; others, who form the majority,
are resigned to living where they can;
few believe there is any choice. It
seems that for centuries most human
beings, have ceased to choose their
environment.
Even so, those who work, drive, eat
and sleep In an environment which
may be dilapidated or pleasant, dull
or dangerous, but Is nonetheless a
recognized, legal and permanent dwel¬
ling-place, are the fortunate ones;
for there are people who do not have
regular work or "decent" housing or
Indeed any sort of job or shelter at all.
These are the people who are pitied
for being undernourished, inadequat¬

accused of having too many children.

margin of world economy and pro¬

w spontaneous settlement known var-
¡ously as bidonvilles, gourbivilles, fav-
ellas, squatters' encampments, bus-
tees or barriadas, probably numbers
two thousand million today. At least
one-third and In many cases a half of
the Inhabitants of the great cities of
Asia, Latin America and Africa live In
huts without light, situated in shameful
fringe areas without water or sanita¬
tion, and places of almost comparable
squalor can be found In North America
and Europe.
When we talk about improving hu¬
man settlements like this, we see that
their occupants are seeking to pro¬
tect themselves from cold, heat, hun¬
ger, disease and dirt; In short they are
struggling to exist. What they want Is
an environment which will not harm
either their, lives or their dignity; and
the latter consideration Is sometimes
more Important to these people than
to the relatively privileged. It explains
to a certain extent why people migrate
to cities.
To sum up, the occupants of human
settlements can be divided into three
main categories: those who can select
the best possible environment; those
who are housed without having much
choice; and those who Inhabit fringe
areas. It is true that all human beings
have the same fundamental needs; but
It Is only true In theory. If these three
categories have any practical prob¬
lems In common, they are those of
freedom, the right to speak, and the
right to act.
Members of the ruling classes auto¬
matically possess these rights. The
essential thing is to belong, either
directly or at second-hand, and money
Is less Important than friendship with
those who count. But even if people
from the same milieu have no commu¬
nication difficulties, this still does not
solve all problems. For instance there
Is hardly a city In the world capable
of controlling Its own growth: when
centres decay and suburbs sprawl, all
the Inhabitants suffer together.
Forthe majority, communication with
the authorities Is difficult, and indeed
until recently people did not even
know how to single them out, and
merely Indicated them collectively as
"they". "They" built expressways,
created or transposed industries, re¬
grouped and redistributed land; by a
stroke of then pen "they" increased
land prices tenfold, demolished sound
houses and erected high-rise office
blocks: and all thes were so many
events to be endured, for both town
and country were governed by fate.
Today however, fate, that far-off
galaxy In charge of planning and
development, Is emerging from its
anonymity. The promoters^ econo¬
mists, civil servants, engineers and
towr planners are acquiring an Iden¬
tity and thus losing some of the magic
powers which admittedly not all of
them were so anxious to possess in
the first place. Now they are coming
forward as technicians of goodwill.
They are by no means Infallible, this
they concede, and do so more fre¬
quently now that their decisions are
being challenged; for they are begin¬
ning to see the public manifesting Its
rebellion on all sides. Those concern¬
ed are demanc"ng to be informed of
urban planning and development pro¬
jects, so that they can have a chance
to discuss, modify or reject them.

This movement is almost universal,
and Is seen particularly in efforts to
prevent destruction, protect areas
threatened by pollution, whether
visual, chemical, "nuclear or military,
and to preserve ancient parts of towns
and with them ways of life.
Some observers deplore the move¬
ment as representing a negative atti¬
tude aimed only at obstructing dev¬
elopment or delaying worthwhile pro¬
jects and making them too expensive.
In fact the desire to protect country¬
sides, rivers or human settlements is
never negative; it Is proof of a definite
choice.
The rejection of so-called renewal
schemes which kill urban life and
drive out local inhabitants is not nega¬
tive: It represents a perfectly lucid
judgment on the kind of town planning
which has, unfortunately, been leaving
its traces all over our planet for the
last thirty years.
Yet it is just those citizens who only
become militant In a crisis situation
who would much prefer participation
to confrontation. Instead of opposing
projects which have been made known
to them at the last minute, they would
be quite happy to take part In discus¬
sions of plans which concern them, If
they could first have the chance of
approving the objectives and knowing
the facts.
Those in charge of development and
administration have everything to gain
by obtaining co-operation from local
Inhabitants rather than Imposing ready-
made solutions on them supposedly
for their own good. This fact has been
appreciated by many town planners
and architects, and it Is they who are
today seeking out the most efficient
channels for participation.
They have also realized that this
new form of democracy, perhaps the
only one capable of revitalizing poli¬
tical life in more than one country,
requires first and foremost a complete
knowledge of the facts; and that It is
their job to make these facts known to
the people concerned.
Everyone knows that nowadays to
possess information is to possess
power. But power is empty unless
there Is the will to exercise it, and
when It comes to guiding or control
ling the course of human settlements,
there is a need for civic awareness,
energy and tenacity to which we
ordinary peace-loving citizens of the
seventies are not accustomed.
The sub-privileged, sub-rural and
sub-proletarian in their sub-urbaniza¬
tion are also beset with problems,
albeit different ones, of freedom and
participation. When peasants who
own no land make their way towards
the cities, escaping from isolation,
they are exercising a choice: they are
leaving one kind of poverty for another
which may be more squalid but Is not
quite as hopeless.
To them the city represents an infi¬
nity of opportunities, a horizon of
liberty. There is no need to ask them
to take part in reconstructing the envi¬
ronment; they will dig, shape, build
and try to renovate come what may;
that is what they have come for. As
for a dialogue with officialdom, they
would be quite willing, but too often
the dialogue turns sour and official¬
dom listens to them with deaf and
authoritarian ears. Sometimes archi-.
tects work with them, acting as then r

Issued with growing urgency, whether
in the name of justice, solidarity, or
even quite simply of realistic com¬
mon sense, as is being done by the
Secretary-General of the United
Nations Conference on Human Settle¬
ments, Enrique Peñalosa. It does no
good to say that government must
provide housing If In fact government
cannot provide...
"The houses of the poor will be
built by the poor, as they always have
been. The great majority of all dwel¬
lings in the world today were built by
the people who lived in them. Beyond
the provision of land, the role of
government in the actual construction

artists sought a new outlet for their talents. As one artist has put it : "We

which brought together over 3,000
delegates from 140 governments In
Vancouver (Canada) from 31 May to
11 June 1976.
In other words governments are
being asked to gain control over the
land in order to entrust it to those who
need It, and to ensure essential ser¬
vices such as transport and sanitation.
Apart from this, let them collaborate
with those who are doing the building.
These then are the objectives of
free participation In the development
of human settlements: on one hand to
give a rudimentary habitat the status
it deserves ("Sub-standard is still bet¬
ter than sub-human" as Peñalosa has
also said) and on the other to create
the social conditions necessary for an
acceptable environment.
At all events, however, men and
women will enjoy a more harmonious
and dignified relationship with their
environment when they realize that
they bear the responsibility for it.

seen to be as high as 90 per cent.
Precise data Is available for only 6
of the 15 cities in Latin America with
more than one million inhabitants. Of
these, 3 each have more than one
million slum and squatter dwellers.
In Asia, 7 cities with a population sur¬
passing one million each have squat¬
ter populations exceeding one million
Inhabitants. Three of these cities are
found In India where 70 per cent of
all families live in one room or less.
Until recently most governments
considered the urban squatter com¬
munities as temporary in nature, a
phenomenon that could be easily
weeded out some day along the cities'
road to progress. But despite the
efforts made by governments to get
rid of this problem, squatter settle¬
ments have proved to be surprisingly
persistent, continually increasing in
by Samuel Chamecki
AS incredible as it may seem,
more than half the population
of the globe will be city dwellers by
the year 2000. According to a study
just published by the United Nations
entitled "World Housing Survey", 51
per cent of the world's population will
be living in urban areas within the next
two decades as opposed to 49 per
cent living In rural areas.
Today, 39 per cent of the world's
population live In towns and cities
while In 1920 only 19 per cent lived in
urban areas as compared to 81 per
cent In rural zones.,
More than "one billion people, or
nearly one third of the world popula¬
tion, now live In substandard housing
conditions, and this situation is likely
to worsen in the years to come. The
problem has become increasingly
acute In cities In the developing
world, particularly capital cities,
where slums and squatter settlements
account for one third to half of the
population.
Overcrowding and lack of basic
sanitary facilities are the two most
striking features of poor housing.
These dwellings lack a water supply
or a public service for waste collec¬

persons to a room In many countries.
In 1920 large cities were still a rari¬
ty; in developing regions, only 20
per ,cent of the urban population
was concentrated in cities of half a
million or more inhabitants, and In the
more developed regions the corres¬
ponding percentage was then 47..
In 1950, In the more developed re¬
gions, over 50 "million-population-
cities" accounted for about 130 mil¬
lion people and, In the less developed
regions, about 25 cities comprised
some 50 million Inhabitants. In 1985
there will be 126 "million population
cities" with some 340 million inhabi¬
tants In the more developed regions,
and In the less developed regions
147 "milllon-populatlon-clties" with
465 million people.
During the present decade, for the
first time, the "million-population-
cities" located In developing coun¬
tries will outnumber those of develop¬
ing countries.
Migration from rural to urban areas
accounts for most of the growth of
cities, being responsible In many cities
for more than 90 per cent of the total
population Increase.
Slums and squatter settlements
bear the brunt of the accelerating
rural-urban migration and city growth.
In most cities of the developing world,
slums and squatter settlements
account for one third to a half of the
population.
Africa has 44 cities with populations
ranging between 100,000 and 500,000
Inhabitants. Studies of 15 of these
cities show that they have a consls-
. tently.hlgh percentage of slums and
squatter settlements. In only two of
the cities does the percentage of slums
and squatter areas fall below 48 per
cent and in one case It is actually

size and number. The question is:
will the squatter settlements of our
cities be assimilated through the nor¬
mal "urban metabolism" or have they
reached such a magnitude that they
are an "urban cancerous process"?
In fact slums and squatter settle¬
ments form only part of the desperate
world housing situation. Deteriorating
dwellings which are overcrowded and
lacking In basic amenities produce
squalid living conditions for another
large portion of the world's popula¬
tion. Nor are these slums restricted to
developing countries; they are tradi¬
tional living quarters for the urban
poor In many industrialized nations
as well.
Over 730 million dwelling units need
to be constructed by the end of the
century In Africa, Asia and Latin Am¬
erica as compared to the 200 million
dwelling units required In North Am¬
erica, Europe, the Soviet Union and
Oceania.
Many countries are building only
two or four dwelling units per one
thousand population per year,
whereas about eight to ten units per
one thousand population per year are
required to meet total housing needs.
This target, according to available
Information for the year 1970, is.attain-
ed in most developed countries such
as France with 9.3 units, Denmark,
Finland and Switzerland 10.4 units,
Japan 14.3, Czechoslovakia, Romania,
Federal Republic of Germany 8.0,
Spain 9.0, Sweden 13.6, Australia 11.3,
and the Soviet Union 9.4.
However, enormous gaps between
the mass housing needs and supply
are to be found In most of the dev¬
eloping countries, a few examples on
the poorer side being In Africa: Alge¬
ria 1.0 housing units, Egypt 1.5, Tuni¬
sia 1.5. In Latin America: Columbia
1.2, Dominican Republic 0.6, Trinidad
and Tobago 2.0. In Asia: Iraq 1.8,
Ceylon 0.8, Yemen 0.1.
As we have seen, one-third of the
world's population Is currently home¬
less or living in sub-standard housing.
It has been estimated that with the
present demographic growth, and
doubling of the population every 30
years, the total number of people liv¬
ing today is greater than all the peo¬
ple who have lived and died in our
entire past. Consequently, humanity
has to build, in less than 25 years,
more dwelling units than mankind has
produced until now, the developing
countries bearing nearly 80 per cent
of this immeasurable burden.

A NEW UNIVERSE
OF
SQUATTER-BUILDERS
millions of homeless people are creating
a new movement of self-built homes
by John F.C. Turner
JOHN F.C. TURNER is an international authority on the promotion and design of
community action and self-help housing programmes in villages and urban squatter
settlements. A British architect, he worked in this field for Peruvian government housing
agencies (1957-1965) and has been a consultant on housing and urban settlement
problems for national and international agencies in Latin America, India, East Africa
and the Middle East. Since 1973 he has been teaching at the Architectural Association
Graduate School and the Development Planning Unit of the University College of
London. A fuller version of the article published here was presented as a lecture to
the Egyptian Society of Engineers in Cairo ¡n May 1975. It summarizes the author's
argument in his'book Housing by People, published by Marlon Boyars, London, 1976.
PUBLIC housing projects are
now being seriously question¬
ed In many countries and in all world
contexts. New directions are emerging
that promise far better physical, eco¬
nomic, and social results for rich and
poor countries alike. Let us examine
some of the problems posed by such
housing projects and the alternatives
that progressive governments and in¬
ternational agencies are now moving
towards.
The new government policies are
policies that support the housing ac-
tions of ordinary people and local
enterprise, instead of government poli¬
cies that act to suppress local initia¬
tive and substitute it with massive
public housing projects.
One example of such support is
found In the squatter settlements of
Caracas, Venezuela.
Most squatter settlements or, as I
prefer to call them, uncontrolled ur¬
ban settlements, are really lower and
moderate income suburbs. Typically,
they start as collections of huts on
land without any services. But, In time,
the occupants build permanent single-
family dwellings, often to quite high
standards. Sooner or later these im-

the hillsides around Caracas in Venezuela
(opposite page). More than a billion people
n the world today live in substandard homes
and this situation is likely to worsen. Squatter
dwellings, generally built by the squatters
themselves, at least provide shelter but often
in appalling conditions. But with time and
encouragement squatters in many parts of
the world have upgraded their temporary
shanties into solidly built permanent dwellings
such as those shown in photo at left.
proved or Improving areas obtain the
normal services and facilities.
Settlers of permanently established
and progressively developing suburbs
are not the poorest citizens. Typically,
they are established and regularly em¬
ployed working class people who have
lived in the inner city before settling
on the periphery, even if they were
born in the provinces and came to the
city as young migrants.
The often overwhelming prolifera¬
tion of these uncontrolled settlements
is a direct consequence of the failure
of the private commercial and the
public sectors to provide the kind of
housing services the majority want
and can afford or even the land and
services with which they could build
for themselves.
Naturally, and inevitably when cities
are doubling their populations every
ten years or so, there soon comes a
time when people suddenly burst out
of the city's overstrained seams, and
flood uncontrollably over any land
they can take. No government that I
know of has ever succeeded in con¬
taining this.
In most rapidly urbanizing countries
with low incomes and small per capita
budgets, the settlements established
and developed by ordinary people are
growing at twice the rate of the city as
a whole. And the cities are growing
at twice the rate of the population as
a whole.
This means that If the rapidly urba¬
nizing nations are growing at between
2 1/2 and 3 1/2 per cent, as almost all
are, then the cities are growing at
between 5 and 7 per cent; and the
uncontrolled settlements are common¬
ly growing at between 10 and 14 per
cent each year. Some I know of are
growing much faster than that.
Obviously this creates major prob¬
lems for the city and the nation.
Equally obvious is the fact that no
government can hope to rehouse
such vast numbers in subsidized hous¬
ing projects. But, before going on to
discuss the alternative that is both
practical and far more desirable, I will
briefly describe the process of urban
settlement and progressive housing
development as I observed it In the
cities of Peru during the late 1950s
and early 1960s.
A typical example is San Martin de
Porres, a very large settlement In Li¬
ma. In fact, this huge area was settled
with the unofficial support of the then
President of Peru, General Manuel
Odria. Rank and file and junior and
non-commissioned officers of the
army and police took a very active .
part In the Illegal occupation actual¬
ly an organized invasion of this area.
A few years later, San Martin had a
population of over 100,000 moderate
and lower Income people in a
reasonable and rapidly Improving
environment.
In these areas, all structures are
built by those who acquire the build¬
ing plots, mostly ordinary low and
lower-middle income families. Most
of the labour is contracted by indi¬
vidual families but many participate in
the construction of their own homes,
and a few do all the building work
themselves.
It ¡s a long process, usually taking
between five and ten years to com¬
plete a first floor to modern space and
construction standard but they do
it very cheaply and without mortgages
or major debts that could threaten a
fairly precarious household budget, or
their security of tenure.
As I saw for myself In Peru, the
investment that one makes, and the
care that one takes of one's house ^
and home, depends very much onr

, knowing one can stay as long as one
needs, or that one can transfer to
another suitable dwelling without los¬
ing money. The investment of per¬
sonal care and savings in housing
depends on security of tenure.
This is in fact the most common
way in which houses have been built
from ancient times. For me it recalls
Thomas More's words in his famous
Utopia written well over 400 years ago:
"Houses in the beginning were very
low, and like homely cottages or poor
shepherd houses, made at all adven¬
tures of every rude piece of timber
that came first to hand, with mud
walls, and ridged roofs, thatched over
with straw. But now the houses be
curiously builded, after a gallant and
gorgeous sort, with three stories one
over another."
AT Arequipa, in southern Peru, I
saw a peasant's "homely cot¬
tage" with "ridged roof, thatched
over with straw" being enclosed by a
new structure. When ready for roof¬
ing the original cottage would be dis¬
mantled and a relatively "gorgeous
and gallant" sort of house would
eventually be built, perhaps even
"with three stories one over another".
The question which must be asked
in every country in the world Is: Who,
or what sectors in a society are best
able to organize, build, and maintain
peoples' homes and dwelling environ¬
ments? The private sector? The public
sector? The popular sector? Or some
combination of these?
I will not comment on the private
commercial sector because, although
obviously important, ft does not
actually concern Itself with low-
income housing and there is a far
greater promise in a co-operative
relationship between the people and
the government.
First, I will summarize what I be¬
lieve to be the common characteristics
of centrally administered housing pro¬
jects as opposed to user-controlled
housing. The essential difference bet¬
ween these two systems is the struc¬
ture of authority or control, that is,
who decides what. -
In a typicaLcentrally administered
project, \ylrtually all! design, location,
financing) building, and management
decisions "are made by a central
agency. However, In the typical and
traditional local housing system all
those same decisions are made by the
users generally owners in con¬
junction with local builders.
Geographically, centrally adminis¬
tered housing projects tend to be lo¬
cated on the periphery of the
built-up" area of large towns and cities.
They are rare In villages and small
towns. This Is mainly due to the size
of the organization administering
them, and the consequent need for
projects to be large in order to be
economic. Large tracts of land, and
land of low or relatively low cost, can
only be found on the peripheries.
On the other hand, user-controlled
housing occurs in all parts of cities,
towns and villages.
Not all public housing projects are
built In the form of blocks of flats, of
course, but this Is the tendency and
general rule. The Idea that tall build¬
ings provide higher densities Is not
always true although it Is generally
easier for a big firm to build big
buildings and anyway more profitable,
especially as labour-saving machines
like big cranes can be used to best
advantage. Big buildings, however,
adapt poorly to awkward sites.
Another major difference between
centrally administered projects and
user-controlled housing areas is that
project dwellings are highly standar¬
dized, and for the same administrative
and technological reasons. The num¬
ber of dwelling types must be reduced
to a minimum or the administration
becomes impossibly complex and
construction costs become impossi¬
bly high.
Typical local housing, sponsored,
built, and managed by local people
and their small organizations, not
only creates the needed variety of
housing to match the variety of house¬
hold needs, but they can build very
much faster, In the aggregate.
In Villa Salvador, a new settlement
to the south of Lima (Peru) sixteen
thousand families, organized by their
own associations, recently established
what is virtually a new satellite town,
practically overnight. Of course they
were living in shacks to begin with,
but a few months later, the great
majority were already building brick
and concrete houses.
TODAY, four years later, over
120,000 people are living there,
almost all of them In better conditions
than when they were living In the city
slums and tenements.- I challenge
anyone to tell us of a case where as
much, let alone more, was achieved
for so many, with so few resources, in
such a short time.
If we take a family lifetime from
the marriage of a couple to their
death, say 50 years and consider
the total cost and the total returns on
a flat built as part of a centrally admi¬
nistered housing scheme versus a ty¬
pical user-controlled house over that
period, we will soon find that the dif¬
ferences are vast.
In monetary terms the difference
may easily run Into thousands of per
cent, for the following reasons: initial
cost, or construction cost, for such a
flat is generally twice the cost of a
similar unit built by a private contrac¬
tor and developer, and often even
more than when built by a small
builder working directly for an owner-
occupier.
And, of course, when the owner-
occupier is also an owner-builder, the
difference is often 400 per cent. These
differences are then multiplied by the
interest and the duration of the loans
needed the bigger the sum, the
longer the amortization period, of
course.
In addition to initial costs, one must
consider operating costs. These are
notoriously high In publicly owned and
administered projects or, alterna¬
tively, the buildings deteriorate, often
very rapidly indeed.
I published a photograph in my
book, Freedom to Build, that
shows a public housing project in
St. Louis, Missouri, (U.S.A.) being
blown up by the U.S. Army. This pro¬
ject won an architectural award for
good design when It was built, just 20
years before it had to be destroyed
because management and mainte¬
nance had become so uneconomical.
This is not an Isolated Incident.
Several major projects are now being
torn down in England, the most recent
of which are two tower blocks near
Liverpool, built in 1957. These are
among the 100,000 unlettable public-
housing units built in Britain since the
end of the Second World War.
It is therefore hardly surprising that
housing costs are spiralling upward,
and out of sight of all low-Income peo¬
ple and low-budget governments,
wherever centrally administered hous¬
ing and building systems have inhi¬
bited user controlled housing.
This is true for the United Kingdom,
as well as the United States, and for
Turkey as well as Mexico only the
latter countries are more fortunate in
that the ordinary people still have
some freedom to build outside the
official administered system.
All countries, socialist as well as
capitalist, and those with mixed eco¬
nomies, are now discovering the truth
of this analysis. And they are also
discovering that the same Is true for
other personal services, most notably
in education and health.
Let me finally describe another
successful user-controlled housing
scheme in which I was Involved. In
1962 several thousand people Invaded.
Pampa El Ermitaño literally, The
Hermit's Plain on the northern out¬
skirts of Lima. Most had low incomes
and 15 or 20 per cent were desperate¬
ly poor.
Most of them were unable to stay
In the settlement and returned to the
central city slums or other more cen¬
trally located squatter settlements.
The great majority that took part In
this highly organized and somewhat
risky Invasion did so because they
could no longer afford to pay the es¬
calating rents for a tolerable dwelling
in the city. They desperately wanted

THE ARCHITECT :
A MODERN SCAPEGOAT
reflections of a Soviet architect
on the merits of old and new styles
FELIX A. NOVIKOV, a leading Soviet
architect, has designed such major buildings
as the Palace of Pioneers in Moscow and
the Institute of Electronic' Technology In
Zelenograd, near Moscow, for which he was
awarded the State Prize ol the U.S.S.R.
in 1975. He is also the architect of the Soviet
embassy now being built in Mauritania,
and has recently completed a book. The Blue
Bird of Architecture.
IT is fashionable nowadays to cri¬
ticize architects. In fact this is
nothing new: it may be recalled that
even the Eiffel Tower once scandaliz¬
ed people, even some whose names
are still respected, and it would not
be surprising to learn that some 25
centuries ago the people of Athens
were extremely annoyed about the
building of the Parthenon.
Yet, seen from our own viewpoint,
the environment wljich our predeces¬
sors succeeded in creating seems to
have been a truly humane and harmo¬
nious one.
We cannot say the same about our
own architecture, which is full of con¬
tradictions and gives plenty of ob- ,
vlous grounds for acute public dis- ^
satisfaction. Since this dissatisfaction r

¡sa fact, and since it is general, it
might be useful to try and understand
its nature.
Why are people dissatisfied ? What
don't they like In present-day town-
planning? And If there really is a
problem, how can It be solved?
There seems to me to be two types
of problem Involved: the first are
purely consumer problems, which can
therefore be fairly clearly* defined and,
given the requisite economic efforts,
successfully dealt with, while the
others are aesthetic problems and as
such entirely a matter for the archi¬
tectural profession, problems which It
is up to the architect himself to solve.
But all too obviously, architects are
not always capable of dealing with
them, indeed many of them think it Is
none of their business.
If only modern society put as much
creative effort into its buildings as it
does Into Inventing machines, if peo¬
ple would only acknowledge that hou¬
ses are more Important than cars, then
architects could again play an Impor¬
tant role in society. Failing this, peo¬
ple will feel increasingly drawn to the
architectural past, comparing the
present unfavourably with It.
The American architect, Peter
Blake, has remarked that old buildings
converted to new purposes are far
more popular these days than modern
architecture employing the latest tech¬
niques. The Architectural Institute In
Pennsylvania, which has moved into
an old training college for dentists, Is
far better, he says, than Paul Rudolf's
spectacular creation at Yale. Simi¬
larly, the French critic Pierre Schnei¬
der argues that the best thing for a
young architect to do would be to re¬
fuse to create new buildings and to
look for ways of using old ones while
they are still useable.
I think that this' undisguised pre¬
ference for old buildings and the
attraction widely felt towards every¬
thing antique represent a natural
reaction against the soulless, machine¬
like character of many present-day
structures. It Is true that people have
always admired the old masters and
always cherished antiques and heir¬
looms, but has this admiration of
antique objects ever been carried to
such lengths?
Have people ever before gone as
far as to mass-produce furniture, do¬
mestic utensils and jewellery that are
pure and simple fakes? This must be
because people want some compen¬
sation for. what modern architecture,
the entire artificial environment, has
so far not always been able to pro¬
vide. Certainly, architects too can pas¬
tiche the styles of the past but sham
architecture is far dearer to produce
than other kinds of fake.
Modern architecture draws criticism
because it is predominantly and aus¬
terely functional. The vast majority of
modern buildings flaunt their con
nexion with engineering, and strive
to exhibit their structure and the tech¬
niques used In their construction.
But for architecture this is not
enough. It has another, a social func¬
tion. The primacy of technology
seems as It were to wrest architec¬
ture away from the spiritual founda¬
tion on which it has stood since time
immemorial. The modern preoccupa¬
tion with technique, if carried to ex¬
tremes, becomes almost inhuman.
The time has therefore come to huma¬
nize architecture.
But perhaps there Is more to It than
that. Architectural development is cy¬
clical in a search for new inspira¬
tion, in a break with traditional forms,
architects often turn to the past.
These are the swings of the pendulum
of history: Renaissance architects
were inspired by antiquity, the Em¬
pire style was influenced by the ar¬
chaeological investigations carried
out during Napoleon's Egyptian cam¬
paign, and perhaps we, too, are today
at a point where the pendulum Is be¬
ginning to swing back towards an in¬
terest in the architecture of the past.
People have very likely grown some¬
what tired of the headlong forward
rush so characteristic of our age.
This is very probably the case. It Is
significant that Unesco's cultural pro¬
gramme includes "study of traditional
forms of architecture In order to use
them in modern conditions".
AT any point in the development
of society, man Is caught be¬
tween past and present, yet in art and
particularly in architecture the past,
even the very distant past, often
appears more accessible than the fu¬
ture. Reproduced in architecture, the
past Is recognizable. For this reason
alone It Is able to evoke familiar ¡ma¬
ges, more readily acceptable than
¡mages of an as yet unknown, unfa¬
miliar future.
Society, however, Is forward-look¬
ing. There are always creative artists
who respond to this challenge that,
too, is traditional. Although the future
Is frightening because of Its unfami-
llarity, at the same time it exercises a
certain power of attraction. Even in
the distant past, new ideas were
never Immediately accepted, and they
never will be. Yet the brighter signs
of the future exert a powerful attrac¬
tion, finding supporters, winning over
the leaders of taste and ultimately
gaining acceptance.
What has tradition got to do with
all this?
Max Frisch, an architect who built
a number of important buildings in
Zurich before embarking on his lite¬
rary career, puts the following words
Into the mouth of one of his charac¬
ters: "What In fact does tradition
mean? I think it means solving the
problems of our time no less boldly
than our forerunners solved theirs.
Everything else Is stylizatlon, mummi¬
fication" (1).
I am all for the programme of
"studying the traditional forms of
architecture", but apprehensive of
"using them in modern conditions"
lest their "use" be understood in a
purely mechanical sense.
Tradition, I am convinced, means
more than just the actual forms of past
ages, otherwise we should have to
renounce all the technical advances
of modern times and go back to
craftsmen making architectural details
In the classical style unless we are
supposed to mass-produce Corinthian
capitals, to use modern technology to
reproduce the traditional forms by the
dozen.
The problem is of course much
more complex, which is probably why
there are so many different attitudes
to it, including the attitude of reviva¬
lists who would trick out modern
structures with traditional forms so
that they remain In keeping with the
historical environment and the natio¬
nal traditions.
But there Is also another way to
create new, modern forms that de¬
velop the characteristic features of the
native architecture. I think that here
technology can only serve as a means
to an end. It is quite obvious today
that technology, no matter how ad¬
vanced, cannot of itself solve the
problem of modern architecture.
Those who believe scientific re¬
search can produce prescriptions for
a harmonious environment are in my
opinion mistaken. I offer my definition
of architecture in the form of the fol¬
lowing equation: architecture =
(science + technology) x art. No
matter what the value of the sum-
mands "science" and "technology",
no positive result can be obtained If
the factor "art" is nil.
Are we not asking too much of our
architects? It is also a tradition to
complain about them, as I mentioned
earlier. It is just that the contradic¬
tions have never before been of such
gigantic proportions. But then all fi¬
gures today are astronomical; our age
is an age of quantity.
This is why I think that if we archi¬
tects carefully and conscientiously
counted up all the magnificent build¬
ings that have been built in the world
In recent years, we should discover
that never before were so many archi¬
tectural masterpieces created. But
since ours is an age of large numbers,
never has the shortage of good archi¬
tecture been so great either.
There is one important point to be
made here. We always judge the past
by Its highest achievements, whereas
we judge the contemporary environ-

OUT IN THE COLD
in many Third World countries
only the better off can afford
"low cost" housing intended
for the needy
by
Joseph Bain D'Souza
JOSEPH BAIN D'SOUZA, Chairman and
Managing Director of India's Housing and
Urban Development Corporation, is a noted
authority on low-cost housing programmes
and community action in new towns. Since
joining the Indian Administrative service
in 1947, he has been Municipal Commis¬
sioner (city manager) for Bombay and
. Managing Director of the City and industrial
Development Corporation of Maharashtra,
responsible for planning and building the
2-mllllon-populatlon city of New Bombay
outside Greater Bombay.
FACED with mounting prob¬
lems of slums and shanty
towns, many Third World govern¬
ments have launched crash pro¬
grammes to build subsidized low-
cost housing for the poor. In India,
for example, public housing pro¬
grammes cost $550 million in the
five years up to 1974. Yet in India,
as In most nations of the develop¬
ing world, most of the subsidized
low-cost houses are now being
bought by the better-off sections
of the communityand the poor
are being left out in the cold.
World Bank figures for five ci¬
ties Madras, Ahmedabad, Nairobi,
Mexico City and Bogota show
that the cheapest public housing
now being built is too expensive
for all but the richest 30 per cent
to 50 per cent of the urban
population.
These figures are based on the
assumption that people can afford
to spend 15 per cent of their in¬
come on housing. It is a generous
assumption. The poorest people in
most developing countries prob¬
ably spend three-quarters of their
income on food alone. The rest has
to pay for fuel, clothing, education,
medical care and household neces¬
sities, leaving only about 6 per cent
to 10 per cent for housing.
On this more realistic basis, an
even smaller percentage of a de¬
veloping nation's people can afford
to buy the subsidized "low-cost"
housing. For the city of Ahmeda¬
bad, for example, it means that the
subsidized housing programme Is
catering only for the richest 15 per
cent of the people. A recent survey
of several housing projects in nor¬
thern India confirms that out of
every ten houses being built for the
poor, between seven and nine are
actually being bought by the bet¬
ter-off.
Yet most public housing agen¬
cies have the genuine aim of build¬
ing houses for the very poor.
What is going wrong?
A scene in my own office, just
the other day, provides an illustra¬
tion of what is going wrong. The
Chief Administrator of one of In¬
dia's largest cities looked at a
chart on my wall which showed
just how little a family living on less
than $36 a month could afford to
spend on housing. "But who can
possibly earn less than $36 a month
nowadays?" he asked, "Hardly
anyone in our urban areas, surely."
The fact of the matter is that less
than fifteen out of every hundred
families In India's towns and cities
have more than $36 a month to live
on. That means only 55,000 fami¬
lies in this particular Chief Ad¬
ministrator's city of 350,000 fami¬
lies. And of the remaining 295,000
families, almost half have less than
$18 a month coming in.

veals what is wrongthe gulf bet-

ween the poor and those who plan
for them. The planners, architects,
engineers and administrators be¬
long almost exclusively to the
middle and upper classes. They
seldom know just how numerous
and how poor the poor really are.
In consequence, they base their
plans on their idea of a house and
their idea of what proportion of the
people can spend what proportion
of their income on housing. They
often assume, for example, that the
poor can afford to spend one quar¬
ter or even one third of their In¬
come on buying a home.
But In practice a family living on
$36 a month can barely afford
$3.60 a month for shelter. Even
with a 20 year hire-purchase
scheme, and even with a subsi¬
dized Interest rate of 5 per cent,
this means that the maximum cost
of a home which the majority of
the population can afford is about
$550.
Faced with this reality, most
planners and architects throw up
their hands in helplessness and
say that you cannot build a decent
house fit for human beings to live
In for about $550. The bricks and
the cement and the steel are too
expensive; the house has to stand
for a hundred years; it has to pro-
ylde privacy for all its occupants;
it has to meet standards and bye-
laws laid down for the benefit and
protection of Its occupants, xj
In practice these norms and
standards, drawn up to protect the
people's welfare, are actually op¬
erating against the welfare of the
poorest majority by preventing the
building of the kind of homes
which they can afford. So houses
which conform to these middle-
class standards of what a house
should be, continue to be built and
continue to be bought by the
better-off people who alone can
afford them. What can be done?
Again, a recent episode in India
provides a clue to what can be
done. In 1975 disastrous floods
destroyed 2,000 poor people's hou¬

later, before any of the housing
agencies had really moved, most
of the flood victims had fashioned
new homes for themselves out of
whatever materials they could find

One of the flood victims, Raj
Kumar and his family, built a mud

without the help of architects or
engineers. Raj Kumar told me that

are starting to build well-appointed
up-to-standard houses for $800 to
help those who, unlike Raj Kumar,
could not afford the $55 for the
material to build their own homes.
Who will finally buy those houses?
Left entirely alone and without
help, the poor in the slums and
shanty towns of the developing
world fend for themselves with
remarkable success. Only by build¬
ing on this self-help can the
"urban-blight" of millions of squa¬
lid slum-dwellings be solved.
With the major part of their
populations concentrated at the
lower extreme of the Income scale,
It Is idle for developing countries
to carry on the pretence of provi¬
ding them all with "decent dwel¬
lings", as defined by planners, at;
prices which they can afford. There
Is no realistic alternative to the
legitimizing of the shanty towns.
As some planners are now rea¬
lizing, the way forward lies in envi¬
ronmental Improvement for the
shanty-towns the provision of ac¬
cessible clean water; hygienic sani¬
tation and surface drainage; gar¬
bage clearance arrangements, and
other basic community amenities.
The settlers and squatters them¬
selves will do the rest If they are
assured that their tenure Is secure
and if they are given the encoura¬
gement and help they deserve.
Selling them small plots of land
and perhaps the basic skeletons of
houses which they themselves will
complete, Is the way to help cre¬
ate thousands upon thousands of
"new" homes on a government
subsidy of only $360 or $550 In¬
stead of ten times as much. In
many cases, no subsidy at all will
be needed. Incentive is all.
Initially, the settlers will complete
their houses with whatever mate¬
rial they can lay their hands on.
If it Is their house, created by them
In their own way, they will even¬
tually Improve it as their own cir¬
cumstances improve.
They will not look as tidy and
photogenic and prestigious as the
smart new estates envisaged by
most of today's planners. Yet, as
Habitat, the U.N. Conference on
Human Settlements in Vancouver,
is helping to make known, the only
way of drastically Improving the
living conditions for millions in the
slums of the Third World Is to build
on the self-help and ingenuity of
the slum-dwellers themselves.
And It will call for a drastic revi¬
sion not only of present norms
and building codes but of "our"
notion of what a "house" really is.

<![CDATA[
For almost 40 years "Grandad" and
"Grandma" (below) lived happily in their
little wooden house with its garden (left) in
an industrial suburb of Nantes, in western
France. Then an "urban renewal" plan led to
their being rehoused in a modern block of
flats (right). For "Grandad" and "Grandma"
this meant not just having a new home but
having to accept a new and to them
unwelcome way of life, as they relate below.
GRANDMA: I lived in a wooden
house at Le Ranzay from the
time It was built. I was seven when
we moved in. It was 1920 and the
house wasn't even finished. We mov¬
ed out In 1965. I lived for 45 years in
the same house, with the same gar¬
den and more or less the same neigh¬
bours. That's where I spent my youth.
And how did we finally come to
move? Well, one day we started hear¬
ing bits of gossip. You know how
these things happen they always
start with rumours which you don't
know whether to believe or not.
People were saying that the Hal-
vèque and Baratte houses were going
to be knocked down and they were
going to build flats. That was when I
went to see the landlord's agent It
was about 1963. "Look", I told him,
"we'd like to build a porch where we
can put our boots and our outdoor
clothes". "All right", he said, "but
make sure you keep the bills so that
If ever you leave you can arrange to
get some money back from whoever
moves In after you."
So my husband and the two boys,
who were working as labourers then,
built a fibro-cement porch. Well, we
got a year or two's use out of It. Of
course we knew they'd started build¬
ing here on the Renaudière estate. A
few wooden houses had already been
knocked down and the people had
either gone into new flats or else into
other wooden houses on the Halvèque
and Baratte estates.
THE UPROOTED
the sad story of an old couple
who moved from their wooden cottage
to a concrete housing complex
The text we present here is a story told by a husband and wife, "Gran¬
dad" and "Grandma" who live in a suburb of Nantes (France). It is
taken from an inquiry carried out between 1968 and 1971 by a group
of teachers and students at the School of Architecture of the University
of Nantes. In September 1972 the French monthly. Temps Modernes
(No. 314-315) published a series of interviews from the same inquiry
in which people of Nantes and its suburbs talked freely to members
of the university team about the problems facing them, particularly
when they had been rehoused in new districts of the city.
People In Le Ranzay were telling
each other: "It's not our turn yet".
But as it happened Le Ranzay was
the first place to be demolished. One
day somebody came along and said,
"Let me give you a tip. You ought to
move Into the Renaudière flats now
while you can. First come first serv¬
ed", he said, "you'll be able to take
your pick if you get in at the start."
But we wondered what on earth we
would do with ourselves in a block
of flats. We'll be much better off stay¬
ing put in our own little house and
garden, we said... They aren't going
to come yet, we'll just wait and see
what happens when the bulldozers
arrive.
Well, we didn't have long to wait.
One day the roadmen turned up be-

hind the house. My husband asked
them what they were doing. "We're
laying out the line of the new road",
they said, "and your house Is going to
be cut in two. Yes", they told us, Le
Ranzay Is going to be knocked
down."
So what did we do? We came here.
We talked It over, and the boys said,
"We'd do better to stay In the same
neighbourhood and take one of the
new Renaudière flats." At least Gran¬
dad doesn't have too far to go to
work. He works shifts you see, a week
on mornings from 4 o'clock to 1
o'clock and then a week on afternoons
from 1 o'clock till 10 o'clock. He
doesn't want to change now at his
age. He's 59, and in the past 41 years
he's got used to the same hours.
You couldn't expect him to get up at
3 in the morning and ride across town
on his moped.
Here, at ¡east we'd still be in the
same neighbourhood, not too far from
our friends. So we moved in here,
into a brand-new 3-room flat. It took
a bit of getting used to, I can tell you.
There's nothing much wrong with
the flat, I suppose, but we don't like
any of the things that go with It.
Worst of all Is not having our own
garden. That's what made It so diffi¬
cult for us to get used to this place.
Of course we've got the central
heating, the hot water, and so on, and
you find these things a comfort as
you get older. But what we can't
stand In this flat Is the feeling of
being cooped up. And then there are
these big windows. They're supposed
to be the latest thing, but everyone
wonders why we need windows right
down to the floor. You get enough
light from the top of the window and
it would be a lot better if you could
move your furniture right under the
windows.
You know, when they build houses
they ought to get women to plan
them. They'd see things with a wo¬
man's eye; they know, what It's like
living in a flat and they wouldn't have
things like that In It.
And then it's such a job to keep the
place clean. You need big curtains
and there's lots of other things to buy
when you move In. What makes It
worse is that you get no allowance or
loan or anything else In fact you
have to pay your rent In advance!
And the amount of work you have
to get through cleaning these big
windows and the floors... Housework
can really get you down, you know.
Of course, we cleaned the windows In
the old place, but they were small,
four windows and that was that. The
real work was doing little jobs like
building an arbour In the garden, mak¬
ing a chicken coop or putting up
cupboards in the kitchen, but at least
you had something to show for It, you
were adding things to the house.
Here the only job is cleaning and
starting all over again the next week.
In the old place there were always
odd jobs to do, and we had a proper
workbench. You can't do anything
like that here. They don't let you
make holes in the walls and anyway
the noise would be bound to upset
the neighbours.
Grandad: We completely changed
that house. I made a sort of workshop
with my bench, because there was no
room In the cellar. We built a bike
shed, a chicken coop and a porch.
We added bits on. We completely
changed the Inside as well. We made
a little kitchen in the cellar and we
divided the main room to make a little
bedroom for dad. The rest of it was
our dining room.
We used to get our building mate¬
rials from the. works, it was cheaper
that way. You could always count on
your neighbours to give you a hand.
People were always adding to or im¬
proving their homes. Those who had
cars even built themselves garages.
Grandma: It's a good job we did
our own improvements, because the
houses weren't all that comfortable.
To start with we had to fetch water
from an outdoor tap. Later on we
paid for the water to be piped to the
house. You arranged with your neigh¬
bour for the two of you to be joined
up to the mains at the same time.
So you can see there was plenty to
do. Even so we had some spare time.
It was a good life. Nowadays people
never have a minute to spare, they're
always In a hurry. And another thing:
in the old days most of the wives
didn't work. That gave us time to do
everything. I used to do the washing
In the washtub, I had the lads to look
after and I still found time to knit and
make clothes. And I used to go out
into town. I was always cheerful.
I know I'm not getting any younger,
I haven't so much energy now, but I
always have to be on the go and yet I
feel lonely and fed up.
Grandad: It's true, people weren't
nervous and irritable like they are
now. I was able to relax while I work¬
ed quietly in the garden or did odd
jobs about the house. They're always
on about leisure nowadays, but it's not
the same thing, it sesms to make peo¬
ple even more tired.
Grandma: We had to look after the
animals as well. We kept chickens and
rabbits and pigeons. We could always
get plenty of grass for them in the
fields all round. I had a dog as well.
But the poor thing just couldn't get
used to being here. We'd only been
here a fortnight. I was downstairs.
The dog wanted to come to me. He
jumped out of our bedroom window
and was killed. He thought he was
still jumping out of a ground floor win¬
dow as usual but this time he was on
the third floor.
As for comfort, we've got central
heating here and that's convenient be¬
cause we don't have to fetch the coal
in and empty out the ashes... In the
old place we had a kitchen range and
we put an all-night burner In the
back bedroom. We certainly- needed
It, when the wind was whistling round ^
the house. But we never froze. r

<![CDATA[
But I'll 'tell you one thing, since
we've been here, I've never had so
many colds. . You've got to admit that
coal fires are healthier. Yet we used
to go out a lot; even in winter we'd
be out In the garden seeing if the
frost had got at the plants, and we'd
have a little chat with the next-door
neighbour over the fence when we
came back from the shops, even
when there was frost on the ground.
Yet we never caught colds I
And we got plenty of sun as well.
But in this flat, the sun just catches
the bedroom In the morning and this
room In the afternoon,' and that's
about it. You don't feel as if you're
living with the sun like you did before.
The sun used to go right round the
house. If It was too warm on one side,
you'd close the blinds and move to the
other.
People have said to me that it must
have been much too hot In a wooden
house in summer. But It was never
too hot for us: to start with, we were
outside all day long. I've sometimes
taken my sewing machine out In the
garden where Grandad had put down
some concrete. I used to cook out¬
doors all summer on an old stove;
we always used to eat outside, where
we'd fixed up lights for the evenings.
Here we may have big windows and
modern conveniences and the sun, but
you still have the Impression of being
shut In. Sometimes I get so desperate
that I feel like throwing my pots and
pans around just to let off steam.
When we lived In the cottages we
and the neighbours were like one big
family. When somebody died or when
a baby was born or when there was
something to celebrate, all the neigh¬
bours used to join In. We were always
In touch, we used to see each other
all the time, and that was because of
the gardens. To start with you had to
go down to the bottom of the garden
to the outdoor privy. You could
always stop for a chat. Not an ideal
place perhaps, but you got to see
each other that way.
I had a lilac tree and we'd stop and
have a gossip under the lilac, talk
about this and that, and tell each
other our troubles and how things
were going. Mind you we weren't in
each other's pockets all the time. You
didn't have to go Into your neigh¬
bours' houses to see them because
everybody lived outside. If you didn't
want to listen to what your neighbour
had to say, you just went Into the
house.
But the garden fence wasn't the
only place where we met. We used
to talk to each other from our windows
without even going outside. The
houses were grouped in fours, making
a sort of square. These were your
nearest neighbours and you always
knew whether they were in or not, you
knew when anybody needed you and
you knew when you could go and ask
them for something.
You knew whether you'd be disturb
ing them or not. It was all as natural
as could be and we didn't spy on each
other, either. If a neighbour was
going into town she'd say, "Will you
look after the boy?" or Can I leave
you the key so you can go and see
that they're asleep?". They were only
little things like that, but they kept you
in touch. That's what's missing here
and a lot of It's due to the way we're
housed.
Here we're closer to each other, we
live on top of each other, but we don't
feel we're neighbours. The staircase
Is the only place where you meet peo¬
ple, but you have to be there just at
the right time; it's not the sort of
place where you want to hang around.
And what do you see of other people's
homes? The landing door, and that's
always closed.
In this block I can sometimes go a
week without seeing even the people
I know well. The woman upstairs
doesn't go out to work, but we can go
three weeks or a month without seeing
each other. And when a new family
moves In, It can take ages before you
get to know them. At first, when
everybody was new here because the
place had only just been built, we
were completely cut off for a long
time.
I remember that we didn't know
who lived In any of the other flats
when we'd been here nearly a year.
That's what's so stupid. It was diffe¬
rent on the estate. When somebody
new arrived you'd help them to move
In to start with. Like that you soon
got to know them Where are you
from? and so on.
The awful thing about this place is
that you never meet people and yet
you seem to be living right In your
neighbour's flat, especially because of
the noise. .
In the house, once you closed the
front door you didn't hear a sound.
Here you're always worrying that If
you make a noise It'll disturb the
neighbours. On the estate you felt
really, at home, that the neighbours
were part of the family. Here you
seem to be living with other people
but you always feel you're alone.
What this place needs is some life.
There's nothing going on here. On a
Sunday It's as dead as a doornail.
They all get their cars out and off they
go, but that's not what I call an outing,
it's just getting out of the house. I can
remember when a lot of us used to
get together on Sundays with our
bikes, the kids sitting on the back, and
we'd go down to the river to picnic.
We'd spend the whole day like that,
we'd meet our old friends down there.
You went where you liked, nobody
bothered you. The menfolk would go
out on their boats, or stay on the bank
fishing. You could spend a nice quiet
day there.
I think It's worse for the teenagers
and the kids. Where can they go
round here? This used to be a quiet
neighbourhood, it was safe for the
youngsters and the best thing was
that they had plenty of room to play.
I remember how my own boys were
always outside playing on the tip,
where they used to dump the rubbish
from the factory, carbide, clinker from
the blast furnaces. They'd filled In a
hole and the tip had grown over with
trees and bushes. The children used
to play cowboys and Indians, they had
a whale of a time there.
When they'd had enough of playing
cowboys, they used to build huts.
They'd take their comics out there.
They used to live outside, either on
the tip or behind the house where
there was an old sandpit that had
been filled in. The lawns around the
flats certainly don't make up for play¬
grounds like that. The kids here can
ride around them on their bikes but
that's about all. And the lawns cost
us a lot of money. We have to pay for
them to be cut and watered and all
that... I'm not against having a few
lawns; they look nice and we need a
bit of greenery, being so enclosed,
but you can tell that the children
haven't got enough room.
I can see very, well that when a child
is cooped up all day It gets wild and
over-excited. But . they've nowhere
else to go. So they shout and scream,
they fight In the stairways or else they
can't sleep at night.
Grandad: It's all the same problem,
you see: the kids haven't a place of
their own, so they kick up a row In the
flats and on the staircases. Then that
gets the old people's backs up. In
some of these blocks they've put 6-
room flats and single-room places to¬
gether on the same landing so that
there are only old-age pensioners and
big families together. And that's
something that just doesn't work.
Grandma: The old housing estates
had a life of their own... There was
the mutual aid club which organized
entertainments. There were dances
and plays, . there was always some¬
thing going on. It was all done by the
working people. The entertainments
committee (this was In the days before
works' committees) prepared the 14
July celebration. It was grand! The
night before there was always a
"torchlight" procession. We used to
go all round the estate carrying lan¬
terns and the youngsters who kept
their candles alight right to the end
used to get a few coppers.
There was a horse-drawn cart deco¬
rated with chestnut branches; all the
big nobs used to get In it and we'd
drive them around. One of them was
the lady they called the super¬
intendent she was In charge of the
estate. She was also captain of the
local fire brigade and she was the one
who played the bugle calls at the
14 July parade.
The lads in our fire brigade came
from the Batignolles quarter of Nan¬
tes. One of them was only about four
foot ten, you could hardly see him

A MAN'S SELF-BUILT HOME IS HIS CASTLE
:red Burns (photo right) is an 88-year-old American who has
lived for the last 37 years in a home he built for himself on a
beach on the Atlantic coast of Maine. His life was one of
ups and downs before he constructed this brightly-coloured
dwelling (above) the sort that children dream of living in.
Orphaned as a young child and penniless, Fred Burns earned
his living picking potatoes, and later fought in the First
World War.
"I only had $ 12.50 when I come here", he says. "And I catch
some fish here. A starving man will eat anything, won't he?
Then the poultry plant come in and build a big factory here.
I worked there a while till I got so I couldn't. And today I got
a place to live, anyhow. It's just something different. All I
done was pick up driftwood off the beach and nails. I bent
old rusty nails and I built it a little at a time, and painted it
with left-over paint. I live alone and I love everybody. That's
the only way to be."

under his helmet. We used to have a
good laugh when we saw him next to
his great tall woman officer. On
14 July, the entertainments committee
organized games In a square full of
apple trees. There used to be a
bicycle race. The shopkeepers offer¬
ed prizes the first prize was always
a calf's head. There was the Bati-
gnolles orchestra as well.
Two or three times a year, the en¬
tertainments committee would get
buses from the works and we'd go
on excursions to Saint-Malo or to Les
Sables d'Olonne. Nowadays there's
only the social centre, but It's not the
same at all because we don't organize
It ourselves.
Another good thing about our estate
was that people used to come around
selling things. The coal merchant
turned up once a fortnight, the day
after payday! He was really marvel¬
lous, our coal merchant, he was a
friend of the family. He used to tell
us the news and If anybody was sick,
he'd let you have coal on credit
if you couldn't pay straight away.
There were a lot of others who sold
from door to door, the milkman, the
grocers, the fishmongers, the green¬
grocers with their horses and carts or
barrows. And people used to help
each other a lot: when somebody was
sick, we'd make soup for all the
family, or stew on a Saturday.
People still do that here, but not as
much as they used to. They just
haven't got the time now. The women
go out to work, they come back tired
out, and it's only right they should :
look after their husbands before they
start thinking about the neighbours.
There was another thing that was
different because of the gardens: peo
ple always sow too many seeds and
everything ripens at the same time,
so there were windfalls for everyone:
"Want some plums?" they'd say,
"some tomato plants, some leeks?".
Grandad: Some of the.shops on the
estate were actually run by the wor¬
kers. It started out with bulk buying
and after the war It became the Co-op.
It was the workers themselves who
started It, and you had to buy a mem¬
bership card.
They used to buy. in bulk from the
wholesalers, but then the government
tried to poke its nose in, and even
tried to close them down. They pass¬
ed laws about the co-operatives and
now of course we've got the super¬
markets.
I've heard the manager of the Co-op
say, "We pay the wholesalers more
for our soap powders than you pay
buying them retail in the supermar¬
kets." Well that couldn't go on for
long. And then the Co-op used to
give a lot of credit, people would pay
when they got their wages. You can't
do that sort of thing nowadays.
Grandma: We've noticed the diffe¬
rence In rent too since we moved. In
1965, to live In the cottage, cost us
less than 4,000 old francs a month,
and that Included electricity, chimney
sweeping, emptying the cesspool, and
the water we used. Here in the flat
we started paying 22,000 old francs
In rent alone with the service charges
and the rates on top of that.
Money went much further in the old
days. Between 1937 and 1939 It was
marvellous what you could buy. We
didn't earn so much perhaps, but
paying the rent and electricity bills
was never a problem. The first holi
day with pay we had, when my hus¬
band was earning 400 francs a week,
we spent one week In Paris staying In
a hotel and the next week with my
family in the country, and we still had
some money left over!
The garden was a help as well. We
grew our own fruit and vegetables...
we bought potatoes and dried b,eans,
that was all. We grew enough toma¬
toes and fresh beans to bottle and last
us all year: we made jam and bottled
our own gherkins. We did all right,
I can tell you.
Of course you had to save: it took
us twenty years to save enough fo.r a
new cooker. In 1938 we bought a
wireless. Before that I bought a pedal
sewing machine: I paid it off at
50 francs a month. It cost us 1,800
francs more than a month's wages.
Grandad: And I paid 700 francs for
my first bike. It was a good one with
drop handlebars. It was a Rafale, a
well-known make at the time; they'd
won the Tour de France.
Grandma: They tell you nowadays
"Advertising has such a hold on you
that you buy things you don't really
need." But you have to live some¬
where, and you need light and heat¬
ing, and that has nothing to do with
advertising. But even these cost far
too much; they take all your wages.
We didn't used to bother about the
rent, I don't suppose It was even
one-tenth of our wages, but now it's
at least one-third ot what you earn.
And now you have hire purchase to
push you into buying things, yet
without it we wouldn't have anything.
But It's the banks that do best out of
hire purchase: you end up paying pro¬
bably double the price for things.

developing countries where, according
to a United Nations forecast, 51 per
cent of the population will be living In
cities by the year 2000.
Several of the lessons are unexpec¬
ted. Hong Kong tells us that, contrary
to findings in certain Western cities
and In experiments with animals,
anti-social behaviour need not rise in
direct proportion to crowding. The
quality of people would appear to be
as Important as their quantity : in
Hong Kong, the bonds of traditional
Chinese culture have held fast des¬
pite the pressure exerted on more
than 49 per cent of Its inhabitants who
have less than 3.7 square metres of
living space per capita.
Hong Kong also teaches that there
may be limits to the process of urban .
growth. One Is the very vulnerability r

Wof the quality of life when more and
more energy from sources other than
human or animal muscle is brought
Into such a thickly-populated commu¬
nity as Hong Kong.
Expressed In terms of consump¬
tion of fossil fuels which consist al¬
most solely of petroleum in the case
of Hong Kong, energy use In the city
has doubled In the past ten years as
It continued to evolve from a trading
centre into a hive of manufacturing.
While the death rate from tubercu¬
losis was cut In half over this period,
the death rate from lung cancer doubl¬
ed and so did the rate of violent crime.
Otherwise, the city's health Is good
although modern medicine has had
much more success against bacteria
than viruses.
A second limit may lie in the feed¬
ing of a city of this size. From a Chi¬
nese type of agriculture in which noth¬
ing is thrown away and everything Is
recycled, Hong Kong Is moving
rapidly into Western styles of food
production and consumption. Organic
wastes once used on the land now
mount Into a pollution problem while
artificial fertilizer is imported from the
Federal Republic of Germany 24,000
kilometres away and hawkers' stalls
display lettuces wrapped in plastic
and shipped from California.
Hong Kong's thriving light Indus¬
tries based mainly on textiles can ex¬
port enough to pay for such luxuries
but such a use of scarce energy to
obtain scarce food would not appear
feasible for the mega-cltles that we
are likely to see In the Third World a
quarter of a century from now.
All these remarks are based on the
preliminary findings of a Hong Kong
Human Ecology Programme initiated
by the Urban Biology Group of the
Australian National University working
In co-operation with the University of
Hong Kong and the Chinese Univer¬
sity of Hong Kong as well as the
Government of Hong Kong. These
studies, which put emphasis on ener¬
gy use In the city and on-the enyirpn-
-mental of the_Jjfe~ofits-
inhabitants, have^becörnea pilot pro¬
ject under" MAB, Unesco's Man and
the Biosphere programme. Director of
the project Is Dr. Stephen V. Boyden
of the Australian National University.
Hong Kong lends itself well to such
research. Since It is, in effect, a city-
state bounded by an International
frontier, all flows of materials and
energy in and out of the city are mea¬
sured as a matter of routine and good
records are available for study and
comparison over a long period. At
the same time, It stands athwart the
industrial and the developing worlds,
thereby constituting a valid example
for both In many respects.
One way to integrate the complex
factors that constitute the life of such
a community Is to look at the energy
that drives It. This has been done by
Ken Newcombe, a research scholar at
the Australian National University, who
has gone at the problem from the
viewpoint of the ecologist.
In 1971, the population of the city .
was 3,939,000, Including 78,000 boat
people, and It was growing at the rate
of 2.2 per cent a year. The city
spreads over 1,046 square kilometres
of land, including 253 islands rising
from 1,823 square kilometres of water.
The rate of energy use in Hong
Kong has been growing much faster
than its population 8.9 per cent an¬
nually from 1964 to 1971. The city is
second only to Japan in per capita
energy consumption In the Far East
and It is almost unique in its depen¬
dence upon petroleum. In 1954, liquid
fuel met 70 per cent of Its needs and
solid fuel mainly coal and firewood
30 per cent; by 1971, petroleum was
up to 98.1 per cent.
Hong Kong understandably lost
little time switching, to cheap oil, so
much easier to transport and handle

Overcrowded

Hong Kong's rehousing
programmes have
enabled well over one
million squatters to leave
the hillside shacks they
once occupied. Though
many thousands are still
accommodated in huts
(photo left) construction
of large apartment
blocks (seen at rear) is
improving living

disorder is not a
major problem
in Hong Kong. Recent
studies attribute this to
the prevalence of
traditional Chinese values
and family cohesion.
These have reduced
tensions, enabling people

for a city that must import almost
every calorie of energy that it uses..
Petroleum products, all refined else¬
where, are used principally to gen¬
erate electricity. They are found, of
course, In the city's transportation
system unusual in the large part
played by 88 ferries carrying up to
600 passengers each but they are
ajso converted into town gas.
Restaurants, of which there are
swarms, use Diesel oil for cooking
but charcoal Is still a standby for
roasting meats and brewing Chinese
medicines. Wood, so Important a fuel
only twenty years ago in households,
has virtually vanished as an energy
source. It was replaced by kerosene
which, In turn, was being edged out
by liquefied petroleum gas until the
oil crisis of 1973-74 put the latter at a
price disadvantage.
This hard-working city does not
squander energy. Only 30 per cent of
the vehicles on the road are private
cars (as compared to 70 per cent in
a country like the United States) and
most people move about in buses,
some doubledecked along London
lines. Energy efficiency in transporta¬
tion Is dropping as the number of
motor vehicles rises while trains only
account for less than 3 per cent of
all passenger movements. The trend
will be reversed, however, In the 1980s
with the completion of an under¬
ground railway system. Even today,
Hong Kong's per capita consumption
of energy for transportation Is eight
times lower than In Sydney, Australia.
Hong Kong's biggest leakage of
energy occurs in the production of
electricity since its power plants are
only 33 per cent efficient, losing the
rest as waste heat and In transmis¬
sion. ON can be converted Into gas .
with an efficiency of 80 per cent and
Newcombe suggests that consumption
could be cut if more gas were used
for cooking and water heating.
Almost two-fifths of the fuel that
Hong Kong Imports Is thrown away In
the process of turning It Into electri¬
city. Newcombe comments: "Adver¬
tising by Hong Kong electricity com-
panles shows that they are now openly
soliciting Increased consumption of
electricity on the basis that there Is
no longer an 'oil crisis'."
Partially because of its dependence
on electricity, Hong Kong's energy use
per unit area is twice as high as that
recorded In any Western industrial
city. There is room for savings. New¬
combe estimates that solar energy,
applied to air conditioning, drying,
space heating and water heating,
could meet 5 per cent of the city's
total requirements with another 10 per
cent coming from methane gas pro¬
duced by the fermentation of animal
and human sewage.
He cites studies made during the oil
crisis showing that local factories
could easily cut their energy bills by
20 per cent. Transportation could be
made more efficient, he claims, If
more food were delivered to small
shops and stalls not In one-ton trucks
but with heavy-framed bicycles such
as those developed In Korea which
can carry loads of 140 kilogrammes.
He admits that such an innovation
must await Improved road safety.
It Is In the production and distribu¬
tion of food that the most striking re¬
volution In energy use has occurred in
Hong Kong, a revolution quite similar
to that now being wrought through¬
out the developing world. Hong
Kong is moving away from Its labour-
intensive Chinese type of agriculture
with a high return of energy In the
form of crops as compared to the
energy invested by the farmer. Sprin¬
kler irrigation and artificial fertilizer
Increase yields but at the cost of more
and more energy Imported from afar.
Nevertheless, Hong Kong's perfor¬
mance remains remarkable compared
to that of a typical Western Industrial .
city. With only 109 square kilometres r
31
]]>

<![CDATA[
k of arable land, the city manages to
grow 5 per cent of the plant products
It consumes.
Its fleet of 5,200 fishing vessels that
range the South China Sea bring
home 40 per cent of Its animal
protein needs. However, not every
growing city has such easy access to
the sea and Hong Kong Itself may run
Into trouble In the future world if fish
catches continue to remain stable in
the face of rising demand.
In overall terms, Hong Kong's food
supply system Is efficient because,
unlike that of Western countries, it
demands but little energy to move
food from the farm gate to the consu¬
mer. Since distances are short, trans¬
portation costs are low. Storage and
-packaging are not major factors: the
Chinese like their food as fresh as
possible and, most of the time, a piece
of seagrass tied around it is all the
wrapping it needs.
But changes are appearing here as
well. Plastic bags are replacing paper
for packaging and this represents a
loss. The plastic takes six times as
much energy to produce and it cannot
be recycled, unlike paper which is
picked out of refuse and sold for ex¬
port. This may be an entering wedge
for the system In Industrial countries
where everything done to food after it
leaves the farm accounts for far more
energy than that represented by the
food.
High-energy techniques, are also
appearing on the small farms of Hong
Kong which average only 1/3 of a
hectare. One example Is automated
sprinkler irrigation replacing the old
system of furrows, buckets and man¬
power. This leads Newcombe to re¬
mark: "Where labour Is abundant, it
is not a labour-saving device but a
labour-using device that Is required."
Traditional Chinese agriculture was
on the other extreme. A study made
of two southern Chinese villages,
Lutsun and Yunnan, in 1935-37 show¬
ed that the land was yielding about
34 units of energy for every unit Invest¬
ed. Of this investment, only 1 per
cent (representing mainly steel used
in hand tools) was supplied by fossil
fuels rather than muscle.
No one thinks that Hong Kong
should go all the way back to such
a system of food production but
Ken Newcombe thinks there Is much
to be learned from the Chinese. It was
from the 4th to the 1st centuries B.C.
that they began to forego beef and
mutton for pork because the pig was
so much more efficient in converting
plant matter into meat. For the same
reason, to get more food from the
same amount of land, the Chinese
(especially in the South) replaced
wheat and pulses with rice from the
3rd to the 6th centuries A.D.
HONG KONG grew food the
Chinese way In the past and,
even today, It still uses food wastes
to raise pigs and poultry. As a result
of such thrifty practices,.only ^hec¬
tares of "forage area" are needed to
feed a citizen of Hong Kong compared
to 1.12 hectares for his contemporary
In Sydney, Australia.
Again, changes are In sight. At
present, food wastes are hauled out
as swill to the New Territories of
Hong Kong where they are fed to
400,000 pigs. But the pigs create a
sewage problem and some consultant
engineers have suggested either
pumping, the pig sewage out, to
sea or getting rid of the pigs. This,
Newcombe comments, might eliminate
the pig sewage problem In the New
Territories but it would certainly add
to the problem of getting rid of food
wastes In central Hong Kong because
it could no longer be fed to the pigs.
A happy example of recycling which
could be of Interest elsewhere is the
International photo competition
«A better way to live»
An international photo competition has been held in connexion with
"Habitat", the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements.
The contest was organized by the International Federation of Photographic
Art (FIAP) and the U.N. on the theme of "A Better Way to Live". More than
1,000 photographers from 77 countries took part, submitting over
5,000 photos. The "Unesco Courier" presents some of the entries in this issue.
The prizewinning photos were shown in Vancouver (Canada) during
the "Habitat" conference and will later tour the world in a number
of travelling exhibitions. Six joint first prizes were awarded to : Paul Almasy.
Paris (a longstanding "Unesco Courier" contributor) ; Jeffrey H. Hinman,
U.S.A.; Felix Tisnes, Colombia; Christoph Henning, Germany (Fed. Rep.);
Peter Corniss, Hungary; and Masaru Uekawa, Japan.
use in Hong Kong of poultry manure
to fertilize fish ponds whose area went
up from 940 to 1370 hectares between
1970 and 1974. This fits In with ano¬
ther old Chinese practice of raising
ducks In combination with fish
farming.
Otherwise, Hong Kong handles its
wastes much as any modern city does.
The population accounts for 3,900 tons
of human sewage a day, 80 per cent
of which flows Into the sea at Victoria
Harbour. As a consequence, an esti¬
mated 3,600 tons of phosphorus a
year Is lost ¡n the Hong Kong food
system.
What Newcombe writes fits many
an urban situation: "For the mo¬
ment, there are no proposals to re¬
cycle the bulk of human sewage, the
largest source of phosphorus current¬
ly lost from the Hong Kong food sys¬
tem. The potential for applying human
sewage, at the stage of primary treat¬
ment, to agricultural land Is much
diminished by the lack of available
land and the prospect of increasing
population generating even more
sewage."
Incentives are needed, such as a
tax on Imported phosphates, and
these might look more attractive eco¬
nomically if one added in the hidden
costs of getting rid of pollution.
Newcombe brings out the impact of
the Westernization of eating habits.
"Throughout Asia, including Hong
Kong, beef Is being - promoted as a
prestige food, as opposed to pork and
poultry. Any shift in meat consumption
toward beef and away from traditional
meats In Hong Kong will tend to in¬
crease forage area demand and even¬
tually decrease the capacity of the
existing food system to recycle food
wastes back Into human food...
"The importance of milk products,
frequently stressed by nutritionists
and exaggerated by multinational cor¬
porations, is questionable. Breast
feeding is abandoned in favour of
cow's milk, fresh or powdered, often
leading to Increased costs, malnutri¬
tion and Infection. According to
Hong Kong paediatricians, there is
evidence of malnutrition in children
whose mothers consistently misman¬
age the preparation of appropriate
mixtures of powdered milk and water.
Clearly, any nutritional justification
for increasing milk consumption is
subject to criticism."
Rejecting the diet and other mores
of the Industrial world need not Imply
a gloomy fate for Hong Kong and
cities evolving along the same path.
Stephen Boyden has the Impression
that psychosocial and behavioural
needs are "much better satisfied for
the average citizen in some of the

developing countries... than they are
for the average citizen In many mo¬
dern Western communities."
A basis for his statement is the
work done by Sheelagh Millar on the
psychoblology of crowding In Hong
Kong as part of the project. While
high density has been correlated with
high crime elsewhere, she finds: "In
Hong Kong, evidence for any such
density-related pathology ¡s lacking.
In spite of the fact that few other cities .
In the world approach its level of po¬
pulation concentration, the degree of
social disorder or of crime In Hong
Kong is relatively low, and disease is
not at present an especially prominent
feature of life as it Is in some other
high density cities."
She attributes this largely to the
prevalence of traditional Chinese va¬
lues and family cohesion (many Hong
Kong factories are, in fact, family
enterprises) which reduce tensions
arising when scarce living space must
be shared.
Hong Kong's Inhabitants adapt well
to density. They can sleep In crowded
buses and on busy streets where an
Individual's desire for solitude might
well be frustrated. Millar remarks: "If
the desire for solitude Is weak or ab¬
sent, such frustration Is not likely to
occur. The Cantonese term for 'alone'
suggests that this Is the case in Hong
Kong. It translates as 'having no one
around whom one knows'."
Factors such as these have led the
Hong Kong project to shun the atti¬
tude that only what can be measured
mathematically is worth measuring at
all. Since the ultimate purpose of the
group's research Is to Improve the
health and well-being of people In
cities everywhere, It must take Into
account the "quality of human expe¬
rience" rather than just trends In the
building of roads, housing, hospitals
and other amenities. This has de¬
manded an integrated approach call¬
ing on a number of disciplines work¬
ing together dynamically. Boyden
puts it this way:
"An increasing number of 'us are
coming to appreciate that one of the
Important reasons why so many prob¬
lems in human settlements remain
unsolved is the fact that knowledge is
not put to best advantage, mainly be¬
cause of the fragmented structure of
our various institutions of learning.
"The academic world is In a state
of extraordinary imbalance, in the
sense that tremendous efforts in terms
of finance and man-hours are devoted
to highly specialized studies on very
narrow aspects of reality... If Improved
understanding is to be achieved, there
Is very much more involved than sim¬
ply collecting data from all these va¬
rious areas of specialism, feeding
them Into a computer or human mind
and expecting something meaningful
tome come out."

a home of their own, free from fears
of eviction or slum clearance, and free
to build a permanent house, little by
little, and without mortgages and risks
of foreclosure. Most were young fa¬
milies, with their parents born in the
villages and towns of the provinces,
but with their children born in the city.
To begin with, the settlement was
nothing more than a shanty town on
a barren desert. So many people
took part, or followed the first settlers,
that the site became hopelessly over¬
crowded.
The government agency, with which
I was working at the time, stepped in.
Adjacent land was expropriated and
the whole area was redesigned
except for the few blocks already laid
out on which people had already
made substantial investments. Work¬
ing with the local association, the
government allocated plots to all the
previously registered members of the
association.
Within one year an astonishing
amount of investment in building had
taken place there was hardly a plot
without a substantial amount of brick
walling, and many had completed one-
story structures. No credit had been
made available, however, and we had
not been able to install the water
supply and electricity planned for the
first stage. These utilities were ins¬
talled later.
The schools that were initially
organized and staffed by the people
themselves became rehoused in per¬
manent structures, and now the main
roads have been paved and the area
Is much like any other established
working class and lower-middle in¬
come residential district of Lima.
The moral of this, and the earlier
stories, Is very simple: It is that the
proper role of government is to en¬
sure that those who are best able to
build, either for themselves or for
their neighbours, have access to the
tools or basic resources for the job.
By "tools" I mean the supports and
resources of the kind that the Peru¬
vian government provided for the peo¬
ple of El Ermitaño: land, or titles to
land illegally but rationally occupied;
technical assistance for the economic
design of subdivisions and dwellings;
and infrastructure In the form of
essential utilities and community fa¬
cilities that the people could not
Install themselves without government
credit and technical assistance.
In some other similar areas, un¬
secured, small, short-term supervised
credits were made available to owner
builders for completing unfinished
houses especially for roofing.
When governments want to increase
the supply of housing for the mass of
people, they must make every effort
to move large construction organiza¬
tions away from house building and
Into Infrastructure development and
into the manufacture of building
materials and the provision of land,
finance and tools. Only in this way
can there be a real, and a rapid
increase of housing for lower-income
people in the short run, and for
everyone In the longer run.

Bio-gas for India's fuel
About 50 per cent of rural India's do¬
mestic fuel requirements could be met by
bio-gas (methane) produced by the fer¬
mentation of the dung of the country's
220 million cows and buffaloes. The nitro¬
gen-rich waste that remains once the gas
has been drawn off could help save up to
30 per cent of India's needs in costly che¬
mical fertilizers. This possibility was de¬
scribed by an Indian electrical engineer,
Dr. Krishna Murty, of Indore University's
Institute of Technology and Science, at a
recent Unesco international forum on sci¬
entific and technological energy problems.

discoveries of modern astronomy and
their subjects range from distant galaxies
to the spectra of comets. A number of
them are being distributed on an experi¬
mental basis until August 1976 by the

Nations Environment Programme publishes
the findings in a special feature article on
the occasion of World Environment Day
(June 5). "Although 'environment' covers
everything from cigarettes to sunlight,"
says the report, "...in theory over three-
quarters of all human cancer could be
avoided by locating the carcinogens (can¬
cer causing substances) in the environ¬
ment and eliminating them."
