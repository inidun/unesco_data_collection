The artistic flowering of early fifteenth-century Russia, associated with the icon painter
Andrei Rublëv and other Masters, also produced remarkable examples of the art of embroi¬
dery such as this expressive portrait head with magnetic gazing eyes. It is part of a full-length
study, executed some years after its subject's death, of St. Sergius of Radonezh (1314-1392), a
leading figure in fourteenth-century Russian history who was hailed as his country's saint-
protector. He is widely known as the founder of the great Trinity-St. Sergius Monastery not
far from Moscow in what is today the town of Zagorsk, where this portrait is now preserved
in the National Museum.

Special supplement
The Unesco Braille Courier
Unesco's magazine for the visually handicapped, formerly published
twice a year as the Unesco Braille Review, is to be published quarterly
from this year as a prelude to the Organization's programme for the
International Year for Disabled Persons, 1981. Under the new title of
the Unesco Braille Courier, the only magazine for blind people
published within the United Nations system will contain specially
selected articles from the Unesco Courier and will be produced in
English, French and Spanish. The March 1980 issue is already
available.
Cover
This peaceful scene of a Bolivian shepherd in
the midst of his flock of llamas and sheep
high up in the Andean altiplano masks a less
than idyllic reality. Case studies published in
this issue of the Unesco Courier on the
Andes, an Alpine village and islands in the
Pacific and Mediterranean show how rapid
population growth, migration and the
pressures of mass tourism can upset even a
long-established environmental and social
balance. Other themes include: the impact of
the ideas of the Bauhaus, the school of
design, art and architecture founded some
sixty years ago in the Weimar Republic;
computer music; and, discrimination against
girls in access to schools and the part played
by the school in perpetuating traditional
attitudes to sex-roles.

<![CDATA[
Acentury and a quarter ago. Chief
Sealth of the Suquamish Indians
rebuked white emissaries who
offered to buy his tribe's land with the
words: "The Earth does not belong to
man; man belongs to the Earth".
That was in 1854. Since then the
world's population has increased by
some two thousand two hundred and
fifty million and at current rates will
reach six thousand million by the year
2000.
Until recently, man and his activities
could be considered as just one among
the many natural processes that are
continually modifying the state of the
biosphere, that thin envelope of soil,
water and air surrounding our planet to
which all life is confined. Today,
however, in the words of the late Pro¬
fessor Vladimir Vernadsky, world-
famous Soviet earth scientist, "humani¬
ty as a whole has become a powerful
geological force". Changes which have
occurred in the biosphere over recent
decades as a result of accelerating
human activity are comparable in scale
with natural changes occurring over
periods of millions of years.
The problem now is how, given this
increasing human pressure, can produc¬
tivity be maintained and enhanced not
only for today but for future generations
as well. The time has come for man to
make rational use of the natural
resources of the biosphere.
A number of difficulties arise,
however, when, having recognized the
problem, we attempt to do something
about it. For though, over the years,
scientists have accumulated a vast
store of knowledge about the Individual
components of the biosphere, the tradi¬
tional specialized approach to scientific
research has meant that the complex in¬
terrelationships and interactions bet¬
ween these components have largely
been ignored. Walking the lonely road
of specialization, the scientist has con¬
tributed a very great deal to human
well-being and progress, but this pro¬
gress has been uneven. A new in¬
tegrated, global, interdisciplinary ap¬
proach to research is needed if the
biosphere, man's life-support system, is
to be properly managed.
The promotion of this new approach
to research is at the heart of Unesco's
Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Pro¬
gramme, which was set in motion early
in the 1970s.
The general objective of this Pro¬
gramme has been defined as: "... to
develop within the natural and social
sciences a basis for the rational use and
conservation of the resources of the
biosphere and for the improvement of
the relationship between man and the
environment; to predict the conse¬
quence of today's actions on
tomorrow's world and thereby to in¬
crease man's ability to manage effi¬
ciently the natural resources of the
biosphere".
Under the MAB Programme, the em¬
phasis of research has shifted from in¬
tensive scientific examination of in¬
dividual topics towards examination of
all the variables and all the processes in
volved in an ecological unit or
ecosystem a kind of self-contained,
self-supporting microcosm of the
greater world.
The specific aims of the Programme
are:
To identify and assess the changes
within ecosystems resulting from man's
activities and the effects of these
changes on man.
To study and compare the structure,
functioning and dynamics of natural,
modified and managed ecosystems.
To study and compare the dynamic in¬
terrelationships between "natural"
ecosystems and socio-economic pro¬
cesses and especially the impact of
changes in human populations, settle¬
ment patterns and technology on the
future viability of these systems.
To establish scientific criteria to serve
as a basis for rational management of
natural resources.
To establish standard methods for ac¬
quiring and processing environmental
data.
To promote the development of
simulation and other techniques of
prediction as tools for environmental
management.
To promote environmental education
in its broadest sense and encourage the
idea of man's responsibility for and per¬
sonal fulfilment In partnership with
nature.
The MAB Programme consists of
fourteen project areas, but these by
their very nature are inevitably overlap¬
ping and interlinked. They include the
main ecological systems and
physiological units: tropical forests;
temperate and Mediterranean-type
forests; grazing lands (savannah,
grasslands, etc.); arid and semi-arid
zones; lakes, marshes, rivers, deltas,
estuaries and coastal zones; mountain
and tundra lands; and island
ecosystems. Man-made as opposed to
natural ecosystems and man's use or
abuse of energy are also covered as are
four major fields of human activity or in¬
teraction with the biosphere: conserva¬
tion of natural areas, effects of
pesticides and fertilizers, major
engineering works, and genetic and
demographic changes. Study of our
perception of environmental quality
views the global problem with the aim
of providing criteria for the value
judgements which the programme
necessarily entails and there is provision
for research on environmental pollution
and its effect on the biosphere.
How does MAB work? Underlying the
Programme are three concepts on
which its approach to research is bas¬
ed : MAB is intergovernmental in struc¬
ture, it is problem-oriented and it is in¬
terdisciplinary.
MAB ¡s intergovernmental for the ob¬
vious reason that environmental prob¬
lems do not stop at national boun¬
daries; regional and global solutions
must be found for those problems
which were formerly tackled piecemeal
within the national context only. The
Programme is controlled by an Interna- 1
tional Co-ordinating Council consisting I

the representatives of the ninety-five
member countries sitting together with
representatives of the United Nations
organizations concerned Unesco, the
United Nations Environment Pro¬
gramme (UNEP), the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO)
well as representatives of the Inter¬
national Union for Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN)
and the world scientific community as
represented by the International Council
of Scientific Unions (ICSU). Unesco pro¬
vides the general secretariat. Each
country's contribution to the Pro¬
gramme is the responsibility of a Na¬
tional Committee consisting of scien¬
tists from universities and research in¬
stitutions sitting alongside government
representatives.
This is extremely important for the
problem-oriented approach to research,
since It means that the government of¬
ficials, who make the decisions, are in¬
volved from Its very inception in the for¬
mulation and carrying out of research. It
means that research is designed to pro¬
vide the Information on which decisions
can be based. Instead of building a dam,
for example, and then asking the scien¬
tist to assess its effects on the environ¬
ment, the question now put to the
scientist Is "What would happen if we
were to build a dam?"
This kind of approach necessarily im¬
plies the third concept of inter-
disciplinarity. It would be useless to ask
only hydrologists the question "what
would happen If we were to build a
dam?" Such factors as the effect on
local populations, on their health, on
food production, etc., demand that
social scientists', medical scientists'
and agronomists' views be also taken
into consideration before any decision
to build a dam is taken.
On almost any problem of this kind
scientists from several disciplines will
necessarily be involved, but there are
considerable practical difficulties in
creating interdisciplinary research
teams and integrating fully the results
achieved. For example, the social scien¬
tist concerned with population effects
may need to study migration trends
over a number of years, whereas a
botar ist may be interested in changes in
the output of a plant community over
the period of a single growing season. In
fact, for interdisciplinary research to
succeed, each research worker must
learn to adapt to the methods and re¬
quirements of other disciplines and this
is never easy.
Unesco's role in all this is to stimulate
and co-ordinate research and to provide
organizational support to the teams of
experts now carrying out MAB projects
throughout the world.
The ultimate human goal of the MAB
Programme implied by the concept of
rational use of the resources of the
biosphere is twofold: the achievement
of development and a high standard of
living for all men coupled with the
safeguarding of the world's natural
resources and genetic stock so that
future generations will have as many
evolutionary options open to them as
possible. Man is the steward of posteri¬
ty. He must recognize his true position
in the order of things and come to terms
with the environment of which he is a
part. "The Earth does not belong to
man; man belongs to the Earth".
Highlands and Islands
Ecosystems in danger
by Francesco di Castri and Gisbert Glaser
IN the fascinating kaleidoscope of
peoples and cultures that make up
our world highlanders and ¡slanders
stand out as a breed apart, characterized by
a fierce independence of spirit and a pro¬
found attachment to their place of origin.
For the ¡slander the physical barrier of the
sea acts as a permanent reminder that he is
distinct from the man of the mainland, cut
off from easy access to many of the
resources readily available to his continental
counterpart and untouched by the cultural
waves that ebb and flow ceaselessly across
land frontiers.
In the fastnesses of his upland home,
those mountains that rise like landlocked
islands from the continental plains, the
highlander too is often so cut off from the
plainsmen below that, even in today's world
of instant communication through radio and
television, his cultural patterns retain their
distinctive forms.
But independence of spirit born of isola¬
tion is not all that unites highlanders and
islanders. The peoples occupying these
microcosmic areas have shaped some of the
most harmonious landscapes in the world,
often achieving an equilibrium, a partnership
with nature, that has lasted for centuries.
Today, in a shrinking world, from the Alps
to the Andes and from the Mediterranean to
the Pacific, the pressures of population
growth and movement and the demands of
development have placed this equilibrium in
danger.
For scientists working within the
framework of Unesco's international
research undertaking, the Man and the
Biosphere. (MAB) Programme (see article
page 5), islands and highlands offer ideal
fields for research on the interactions bet¬
ween ecology and development. Being
small, relatively clearly defined units, the
forces and interactions that affect the com¬
plex man/environment relationship can be
fairly readily identified and modelled and the
lessons learnt applied to other larger and
more intricate systems.
In two of the mountain areas and two of
the island ecosystems in which MAB
research teams have been working the
Andes, the Alps, the Tunisian island of Djer¬
ba in the Mediterranean and the Fiji Islands
in the Pacific population movements of
various kinds have been the underlying
cause of instability and environmental
change.
For many centuries, human habitation in
the central Andes was concentrated mainly
in the altiplanos, or high plateaux, with set¬
tlements spanning the range from isolated
rural communities to large urban centres.
The adjacent downslope areas were more
sparsely settled, particularly the tropical
forest areas in the lowlands west of the
Andes. During this century, and especially
since 1950, there have been great
movements of population to the urban areas
in the mountains, to the lower altitude areas
and, above all, to the coastal towns and
cities.
Emigration from the highland areas results
in part from growing population pressure on
a limited resource base and in part from a
real or an expected better quality of life in
other areas. For a variety of social and
political reasons the patterns of land ex¬
ploitation established in the altiplanos after
the Spanish conquest remained static and
when faced with rapid population growth
the capacity of the highland areas to support
ever-increasing numbers was rapidly
stretched to the limit. The result was over¬
use of land, particularly over-grazing, a
decline in productivity in many areas and a .
consequent increase in emigration, especial¬
ly among the younger and more dynamic
people.
Migration on the scale now being ex¬
perienced in the Andes affects the environ¬
ment through over-use in some areas and
under-use in others. Another consequence
has been that for the first time in history the
downslope areas below the altiplanos are
being massively exploited. Unfortunately,
lack of sound agricultural practice is leading
to accelerated erosion of the soil which not
only affects the productivity of these areas
directly but also has a negative effect on
lowland areas.

<![CDATA[
Migration is also putting serious pressure
on the housing and health services and
other amenities in the urban areas, especial¬
ly in the coastal towns and cities to which
the population flow is the greatest. The
health problems are enormous since the
altiplano populations arriving in the humid
low altitude areas are especially vulnerable
to bacterial, viral, parasitic and microbial in¬
fections against which they have no natural
immunity.
In the Alps, population movement has
been in two directions. The traditional
mountain populations are abandoning some
of the higher altitude areas, while adjacent
lower areas are becoming comparatively
crowded. But the main cause for concern is
the transformation of what was formerly a
relatively stable agricultural and pastoral
system due to seasonal inflows of people
from outside the area on such a vast scale
that the carrying capacity of these areas may
well be exceeded.
These inflows are made up of summer
and winter tourists and weekend visitors
from the densely populated neighbouring
regions. To these must be added owners of
second homes who often become perma¬
nent residents upon retirement. Many tradi-
more marked by ski-lifts and ski-run erosion
than by the beauty of the traditional Alpine
landscapes, and even winter tourism will be
discouraged if the areas become too crowd¬
ed, too built-up and if traffic on the moun¬
tain roads rivals that in the towns.
Agriculture, too, is very much af¬
fected only in tourist areas but
throughout the Alpine region. New attitudes
towards agricultural work and rural life are
as important as the profitability of
agricultural and pastoral use of steep and
isolated mountain lands in provoking the
abandonment of certain areas or the ap¬
pearance of phenomena such as undergraz-
ing. As fewer and fewer pathways for the
herds remain available the old practice of
transhumance (the moving of cattle from
winter to summer pastures) is disappearing
in the western Alps. One immediate side ef¬
fect of this abandonment of grazing land is
that changes in the vegetation cover create
surfaces more conducive to avalanches.
The direct effects of the massive increase
in the numbers of skiers over the past
decade must also be taken into account.
Aerial photographic surveys have shown
how much the impacting of snow by
thousands of ski descents every winter
islands. The impact of the mass tourist in¬
dustry has upset the balance of what were
once relatively self-sufficient, traditional
agricultural and pastoral systems.
On the Tunisian island of Djerba, for ex¬
ample, the traditional system was already
not fully self-sufficient, as emigration was
always extensive, and remittances from rich
emigrants in Tunis or even further afield
have played a major role in keeping the
economic system functioning, and in main¬
taining a standard of living which is higher
than that in most other areas of Tunisia.
Large-scale tourism was introduced only
in the late 1960s. During the peak tourist
seasons 0/ the last few years, the number of
visitors on the island has been twice that of
the native population. The needs of these
tourists for hotel accommodation, water,
food and services, and their contacts with
the local population, have modified the en¬
vironment, the land-use systems, the overall
economy, the physical infrastructure, the
society, the maintenance of cultural tradi¬
tions and the aspirations of the people of
Djerba.
Major problems arise from the competi¬
tion between agriculture and the tourist in- k
dustry for the two main limiting resources, Y
tional villages, Alpine pasturelands and, in¬
deed, whole valleys can no longer meet the
demands of this additional population for
avalanche-safe building land, water, roads,
energy supplies, ski-lifts and ski-runs. There
is also the risk that excessive population
concentration may lead to water, air and
land pollution.
Certain areas may risk losing their attrac¬
tion for summer tourists if landscapes are
hinders the run-off of water in the spring.
Vegetation is destroyed by the cutting edges
of skis and it has been found that along the
ski runs the insect population is decimated
and the number of earthworms per square
metre along some trails, scientists have
discovered, has been, reduced from 130 to
ten.
Tourism has also been one of the major
causes of change in many Mediterranean

water and labour. The risk of under-use of
the land, with all its ecological conse¬
quences, cannot be ignored, given the
changing attitudes towards agricultural
work. Under these circumstances,
agriculture and pastoralism require special
support and guidance.
-The socio-cultural impact of tourism may
well be the cause of the most serious prob¬
lems at the present time. The sudden "con¬
frontation" of a traditionally rural, mainly
Islamic society with "liberalized", mainly ur¬
ban Western Europeans, their lifestyle and
their money, may lead too abruptly to
changes in attitudes and cultural identifica¬
tion within the local society.
Another important problem is the
transformation of the traditional Djerbian
landscapes through these new dev¬
elopments. Tourists come, not only in
search of sunshine and beaches, but also of
the remnants of this traditional landscape
and the traditional life-style.
Although their population is small in
numerical terms, the outlying eastern
islands of Fiji appear to have more in¬
habitants than they can at present support.
The situation in which they find themselves
is common to many other tropical islands
and, indeed, to many rural areas in the
developing world. Typical of this situation is
the use of land to produce a single crop for
export (in the case of Fiji this is copra) which
is in economic decline because of falling
world market prices, at the expense of food
production for the subsistence of the island
populations.
Inter-island produce exchange in Fiji has
virtually disappeared and the network of
flows of materials and people between
islands has almost completely collapsed.
With the decline in demand for copra, fewer
and fewer ships call on them and they
become more and more isolated. The
response to this situation is increased

Each year, the 300 inhabitants of
the Austrian Alpine village of
Obergurgl (below) act as hosts to
40.000 tourists. On the Tunisian
island of Djerba (bottom), situated
in the Gulf of Gabès and known to
the ancients as the "land of the
lotus-eaters", tourists outnumber
the approximately 11,000 islanders
by two to one at the height of the
holiday season. Although large-
scale tourism has brought
economic advantages to these
areas, it threatens to upset both
their environmental equilibrium and
traditional life-styles.
emigration to the larger islands or to con¬
tinents where the economic growth centres
are.
Thus, while the outer islands are under¬
used, the main islands are no longer self-
sufficient in food production and food im¬
ports are increasing. In Fiji, the size of the
population flows to the two major islands of
Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, and especially to
the capital area, Suva, has become so great
that housing, employment and schooling
needs can no longer be met.
Have the Unesco/MAB researchers any
solutions to offer to the decision-makers
who have to cope with the kinds of prob¬
lems outlined above? The answer is that in
the two cases where their research is near-
ing completion they certainly have.
The village of Obergurgl, at the head of
the Oetz valley in the Austrian Tyrolean Afps
faces many of the problems affecting Alpine
areas described above. Situated at an
altitude of about 2,000 metres, the village
draws an ever-increasing number of summer
and winter tourists. The first signs of the en¬
vironmental consequences of this "develop¬
ment", expressed largely in terms of hotel
and ski-lift construction and a sharp increase
in the presence of people (and cars) in the
village and its surroundings, are beginning
to appear. The people of Obergurgl (300 in¬
habitants) perceive these as negative, and
fear that eventually tourists might stay away
from their village because they no longer
find it attractive. Another potential limit to
this type of economic growth is simply the
availability of avalanche-safe land.
The MAB National Committee of Austria,
following proposals put forward by resear¬
chers of the University of Innsbruck and
working in collaboration with the Interna¬
tional Institute of Applied Systems Analysis
in Laxenburg, Austria, chose Obergurgl as aw
site for intensive study. Y

Diagram, above, shows the many
interlinked factors which have to be
taken into account in planning for the
balanced development of even a small,
well-defined community like the village
of Obergurgl in the Austrian Alps.
Alteration of any one of these factors
may have complex and sometimes
unexpected repercussions on the
others. To take the simple example of
ski-lift waiting time if winter visitors
have to queue up for more than a
certain length of time, they will stay
away in future years; if more ski-lifts
are built, more winter tourists will
come, and more hotels will have to be
built, thus reducing the land available
for cattle grazing and the production of
forage; summer tourists will stay away
as the scenic attractions of the area are
increasingly marred by unsightly ski-
lifts and additional building; summer
employment in tourism will fall and
emigration will increase. The study of
Obergurgl undertaken by the Austrian
National Committee for Unesco's Man
and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme,
in collaboration with the Institute of
Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg,
set an example in that the population of
Obergurgl was consulted and involved
at every stage of the investigation.

. The disciplines working together in this
project include meteorology, botany,
zoology, microbiology and pedology, as well
as economic . geography, anthropology,
sociology, regional planning sciences and
economics. The great success of the project
lies, however, in the fact that it was possible
to involve in its work not only the research
workers, but also those actually concerned
by the research and in need of the informa¬
tion generated by it.
In fact, since its beginning in 1973, the
project has provided a framework for a per¬
manent dialogue and feedback mechanism
between the local population, local political
representatives, the village administration,
the Tyrolean government and the research
workers.
Thus, the three different dynamic models
of Obergurgl which have been developed in
successive stages of the project combine the
insights and knowledge of scientists and of
the people of Obergurgl. The first model
was a preliminary attempt to show human
impact on a simple mosaic of Alpine
ecosystems, and the policy options
available. It dealt with recreational demand
predictions, population growth in relation to
alternative economic development, farming
and environmental change,' animal popula¬
tion patterns, forests and the rates of
avalanche and erosion. The model allowed
the simulation of predictive scenarios of
alternatives for the development of
Obergurgl in the coming twenty to forty
years, and their constraints.
Obergurgl Model II enriched Model I with
the results of various concurrent scientific
and anthropoiogical studies such as the
determination of thresholds of necessary en¬
vironmental disturbance before erosion oc¬
curs, and the weighting of the factor of
landscape quality by tourists and local
populations. Both models, however,
represented the very particular situation of
Obergurgl, and were not easily transferred
to other geographical areas in the Alps.
Model III was developed for transferring
results to other regions. It is based on the in¬
vestigation of the types of changes which
occur in the major types of ecosystems and
physical terrain under different degrees of
environmental stress and forms of use (graz¬
ing, skiing, etc.). Thus, by simulating the
environmental consequences of various
development alternatives. Model III provides
a useful and widely applicable planning
instrument
In Fiji, with financial assistance from the
United Nations Fund for Population Ac¬
tivities (UNFPA), Unesço-MAB conducted a
pilot research project with a broad inter¬
disciplinary approach.
For about two years, from 1974 to 1976,
field studies were undertaken in Fiji, concen¬
trating on the systems relations between:
(a) human population dynamics; (b) use of
natural resources from a set of interlinked
ecosystems ranging from marine to coastal
and terrestrial; (c) the function of the few
outer islands in eastern Fiji which were-
studied, in relation to national and global
economic development structures.
By integrating the various component
studies the project has been able to for¬
mulate suggestions for more rational
management of the resources of the outer
islands. For the farmers of the outer islands,
the economic reward of coconut growing is,
in cash terms, far smaller than that of the
Fiji-consumed taro, and yaqona is even
more lucrative.
A first suggestion is that the agricultural
production of the islands relatively close to

the urbanized areas of Fiji in Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu be developed so as to be wholly
absorbed into the national market. For the
more distant islands, a mix of export pro¬
duction and supply to the national market
should be envisaged.
The project also provided detailed recom¬
mendations on the potential diversity of land
and sea use, including development of pine
schemes and methods of aquaculture for
more intensive fish production.
I
Programmes to increase rural incomes,
expand employment opportunities, and im¬
prove the quality of life in rural areas would
reduce the rate of urban immigration and
alleviate problems in the urban areas of the
two largest islands. The project analysed the
possibilities for this change and developed
alternative scenarios for the future.
It was, of course, not sufficient to study
various outer islands in isolation. Emphasis
had to be laid on the study of the flow of
material and people, political influence/deci¬
sions, etc., among these islands and bet¬
ween the islands under study and the out¬
side world, mainly the two major islands of
Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.
This approach alone made it possible to
consider important questions related to
population carrying capacity. Are these
islands overpopulated? Can they carry more
people than they do now? Alternatively, is a
shortage of people likely to become critical
as a limitation to development?
A methodology has been developed to
calculate the carrying capacity of these
islands under different human use systems.
Surprisingly, results show that the outer
islands are underpopulated for other types
of land use. Even the number of people that
could be supported at minimum recom¬
mended standard-of-living levels in a pure
subsistence economy would be far higher
than the present population, under a copra
economy in decline. In fact, most of the
islands under study could support larger
populations if their economies were based
on more diversified and rational use of the
land.
MAB research findings are now helping to
shape the decision-making process at
Obergurgl and in the Fiji Islands. But, more
than this, they are helping to solve the prob¬
lems of other mountain tourist areas and
other island groups. For although both pro¬
jects involve very specific local problems,
every MAB project is designed to provide
"core" material applicable to other regions.
The research methods evolved during the Fi¬
ji project, for example, are already being us¬
ed in a current study of Caribbean islands,
and the Obergurgl study led to the develop¬
ment of a model applicable to many other
Alpine regions under environmental stress
as a result of changing agricultural practices
and the pressure of tourism.
Altogether some 950 MAB research pro¬
jects of all kinds are now in progress.
Research findings are being fed into a com¬
puterized information system and a body of
basic information on appropriate methods
for handling environmental and resource-
use problems is gradually being acquired
which is freely available to decision-makers
the world over. The MAB dream of a world
in which man lives in partnership with nature
making rational use of the natural resources
of the biosphere is slowly but steadily
becoming a reality.

(1919-1933)
Design for living in the modern world
The Bauhaus, the school of design, art and architecture founded by
Walter Gropius sixty years ago at Weimar (Germany), has had a
seminal influence on the environment modern man has created for
himself. Its impact on the design of buildings, furniture, typography,
household goods, tools and many other articles in everyday use,
extended far beyond its native Germany for when the school finally
closed down in 1933 after the Nazis came to power, its leading staff
members and students emigrated and carried its message to many
other countries.
What was this message? For Gropius, the school's "specific mission
was the realization of a modern architecture which, like human nature,
should be all-encompassing". Gropius proclaimed the unity of the arts,
obliterating the traditional distinction between artisan and artist and
seeking to forge new links between industrial mass production, the
crafts, the sciences, the creative forces of the time and the eternal
laws of materials. He wished, he wrote later, "to draw the creative
artist from his ivory tower, to bring him back to the world of everyday
reality". Under his direction the Bauhaus studios became laboratories
where prototype designs for industry were developed. "Although these
prototypes were hand-made", he wrote, "their creators had to be
completely familiar with methods of industrial production; and so the
Bauhaus sent its best students to work for a time in factories during
their studies".
One facet of Gropius's genius was that he attracted to the Bauhaus as
teachers some of the most outstanding European artists of his time.
These were, Gropius noted, "not men who would behave like
musicians in thrall to the conductor's baton", and throughout its
lifetime the Bauhaus was in fact a ferment of debate as these great
figures wrestled with the problems of finding a "truer relationship
between form and function, form and material, form and production
methods". On pages 14 to 17 we attempt to give the general reader a
glimpse of the teachings on the "elements of form" developed by two
of these artists, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, while they were
instructors at the Bauhaus. Pen drawing at left by Oskar Schlemmer is
another reminder of the school's all-embracing ambitions and
preoccupations. It arose out of the course on man which Schlemmer
taught from 1922 to 1929 and whose goal was, Schlemmer noted,
nothing less than to familiarize the student "with man in the totality of
his being". "The relationship between man's dimensions and the
outside world", wrote Schlemmer, "constitutes an initiation into the
problems of housing and its disposition."
From the moment when it was created in the climate of limitless hopes
and possibilities which prevailed in Europe at the end of the First World
War, the Bauhaus has never ceased to generate controversy. The
article by Claude Schnaidt on page 18 is a new contribution to this
endless debate about an institution whose purpose in its founder's
words was "not to propagate any style, system or dogma but to exert
a revitalizing influence on creation".

Kandinsky at the Bauhaus
The grammar of a visual language
"The drawing course at the Bauhaus is an education in perception, teaching
precise observation and representation, not of the external appearance of objects
but of the elements of which they are constructed, their laws of tension... "This
was the guiding principle followed by the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky
(1866-1944), one of the great innovators and theorists of non-figurative art, in the
analytical drawing course which he taught at the Bauhaus, where he was a
professor from 1922 to 1933. Already the author of a celebrated pioneering treatise
on abstract art. Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1911), Kandinsky during his
Bauhaus years evolved a comprehensive science of abstract art which he
presented in a major work entitled Point and Line to Plane (1926). In this book he
rigorously analyses the two basic elements of form, the point and the line, first in
abstract terms and then in their different manifestations in nature and such arts
as architecture, dance, music and the graphic arts. Building on this analysis,
Kandinsky goes on to formulate the principles of a new formal logic which is
based on the inner "resonances" of forms and heralds a synthesis of the arts
through the equivalence of the "languages" they use. The ultimate aim of this
new science, as Kandinsky saw it, was to provide the artist with a means of
mastering his creation, and consequently the initiation into the grammar of a
visual language held an important place in the theoretical training which he gave
at the Bauhaus. Illustrations on this double page and the commentaries
accompanying them are all taken from Kandinsky's book Point and Line to Plane,
published in the "Bauhaus Books" series directed by Gropius and Moholy-Nagy.

Klee at the Bauhaus
The linear logic of fantasy

One of the outstanding figures of twentieth-century
European art, the German painter Paul Klee (1879-1940)
taught at the Bauhaus from 1921 to 1931. A gifted teacher
as well as a great artist, he developed a theory of art
rooted in his own work and founded on the principle that
"movement is at the basis of all becoming". The idea of
movement underlies his definition of line as the trajectory
of a moving point and space as resulting from the
movement of line. Klee's theory is illustrated here in a
drawing significantly entitled The Formation of Space by
a Straight Line in Movement (1). The free-ranging
inventiveness with which Klee experimented with line is
evident in Fool in a Trance (7) which the artist described
as an "example of the superposition of movements
captured on the spur of the moment". The figure is
delineated with a single, unbroken line. The
preoccupation with movement recurs in the watercolour
Choppy Rapids (2), in which the mounting speed of the
rushing torrent is expressed by the progressive
subdivision into smaller units of a number of broad
stripes. Klee sought constantly to refine and purify his
theory of dynamics, and in the course on "the mechanics
of form" which he gave at the Bauhaus in March 1924, he
took the circle as the prototype of movement and the
arrow as signifying directed movement. The watercolour
In Copula (5) illustrates this development in Klee's
thinking: a figure consisting of stretched segments
oscillates in space between a red circle and a blue arrow.
The arrow hurtles along horizontally; it escapes the
clutches of gravity but does not climb as it gathers speed.
The work symbolizes cosmic space in which movement is
the norm and balance is the law. Klee believed that the
deepest sources of the creative process reach into the
unconscious. Hence his preoccupation (which made him
one of the first artists to take an interest in drawings and
paintings produced by children and the mentally ill) with
the transfer of apparently irrational subconscious
impulses into the world of consciousness. Something of
this aspect of the artist's work can be felt in the pen
drawing Winged (6). If the drawing is turned 90 degrees
on to its right side, the two pointed shapes are seen to be
energetically flapping wings. However, Klee specifically
indicated that the figure (actually an angel) should be
looked at horizontally.

Klee believed that painting should seek a
reality beyond that of appearances, though
without discarding elements of the visible
world. Like all his works the watercolour
Olympus Destroyed (3) illustrates this
desire "to penetrate to the interior". A
conglomeration of jagged saw-tooth peaks,
haphazard flights of stairs, a door leading
nowhere, pillars all askew, evoke the
disaster which struck the abode of the
gods. Although the treatment could hardly
be more different, the theme recalls The
Fall of the Giants (4) by Giulio Romano (the
Italian Renaissance painter and architect,
disciple of Raphael and Michelangelo and
teacher of Rubens). Breaking with the
representational tradition in European art,
Klee coined the saying: "art does not
reproduce the visible; it renders visible".

"There is no difference in nature between the
artist and the craftsman: the artist is nothing if
not an inspired craftsman", wrote Walter Gropius
in the opening Manifesto of the Bauhaus in 1919.
The unification of art and technically expert
craftsmanship found expression in such fields as
tapestry weaving, which had a prominent place in
the school's curriculum. This brightly coloured
tapestry was created in 1927-1928 by Gunta
Stadler-Stölzl, then a teacher at the Bauhaus.
Featuring several motifs associated with the work
of great artists who taught at the school, it forms
a kind of visual synthesis of some of the
intellectual and artistic currents which met there.
The motifs include the chequerboard patterns at
left and right (Klee. Itten and Kandinsky) and the
mountain and wave in upper
section of tapestry (Klee).

Architects of an
educational revolution
by Claude Schnaidt
w
£jfl M IHEN a young man who feels in himself the
soul of a creator starts out by learning a
craft, as he would have done in olden times,
then he ceases to be an unproductive artist fated to practise
his art imperfectly, for the craft, in which he can excel, gives
him scope to cultivate his gifts. Architects, sculptors,
painters, we must all return to the craft... Let us all together
imagine and create the new edifice of the future, in which
painting, sculpture and architecture will be one, and which
will one day rise to the sky from the hands of millions of
workmen, a crystalline image of a new faith".
This was the message set forth in the inaugural manifesto
of the Bauhaus, the school of architecture and the applied
arts which was created at Weimar in 1919 out of the fusion
of the city's Academy of Fine Arts and School of Decorative
Arts. The Bauhaus (the term literally means "house of
building" and evokes the Bauhütte where medieval
cathedral builders were lodged) moved to Dessau in 1925,
then to Berlin in 1932, and closed down in 1933 when the
Nazis came to power. The school's directors were in turn the
architects Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Mies
van der Rohe. Among the famous artists who taught there
were Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Josef Albers, Laszlo
Moholy Nagy, Johannes Itten, Lyonel Feininger, Oskar
Schlemmer and Georg Muche.

Five paintings by artists who taught at the
Bauhaus evoke the brilliant and versatile creativity
of which the school was the focus. Left hand
page, below: Ober Weimar, an oil painting
executed by the U.S. artist Lyonel Feininger in
1921. The upward-sweeping beam of light has been
likened to a ray of hope in the sombre and chaotic
world of Germany emerging from the post-war
crisis. Above, The Staircase at the Bauhaus (1932)
by the German painter Oskar Schlemmer. The
German critic Ludwig Grote has seen the
significance of the painting as symbolizing "all the
Bauhaus meant for the young students who
received its creative training. In harmony with the
luminous architecture of Gropius, with its
simplicity, its classicism, young people go up and
down the staircase of the Dessau Bauhaus. They
are inspired by its spirit and by the grandeur of the
mission entrusted to them". Right hand page,
below left: oil painting by the Hungarian painter
and photographer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Mein
Buntes Bild ("My Many-Coloured Picture"). 1933.
Moholy-Nagy had a life-long interest in the effects
of light and light in motion. He epitomized the
Bauhaus's determination to create artefacts which
could be easily reproduced (even from instructions
given by telephone), standardized objects of
"industrial art" for use in everyday life. In 1937
Moholy-Nagy became founder of the New Bauhaus
in Chicago. Top, Yellow-Red-Blue (192S), oil
painting by Wassily Kandinsky. It displays many of
the characteristic motifs of his work which
through his teaching became part of the school's
collective heritage. Below right, Eros (1923), a

Those who would epitomize this legendary institution as a
community of exceptional personalities, a synthesis of arts
and crafts, a shrine of functionalism, a home of the interna¬
tional style, or a leftist utopia of the turbulent twenties, do
not entirely miss the point but they do not tell the whole
story either. The originality of the Bauhaus stemmed from its
refusal to be confined within the world of art and theory and
from its insistence on making a mark on the material aspects
of culture and on education. The Bauhaus went beyond the
interpretation and comprehension of the modern world;
drawing on all the most vital currents of its time and produc¬
ing a wealth of innovations, it physically transformed the
modern world, thereby strengthening its own influence. And
yet, beset by the forces of conservatism, closed down three
times in fourteen years, many of its ambitions were destined
not to be fulfilled.
The school's existence might be broken down into three
phases which in a way matched the three-act drama of the
first German Republic: 1919-1924, a tinte of expressionism
ending in the betrayal of revolution, in fear and inflation;
1925-1929, years of rationalistic hope for prosperity, trium¬
phant technology and social-democratic management;
1930-1933, when perfectionism was paralyzed by crisis,
unemployment and fascist terror.
In the early years, the students were taught jointly by two
instructors, one a craftsman, the other an artist. Later when
Bauhaus professors photographed on the terrace of the
students' house at Dessau in 1926. Left to right: Josef Albers,

a new generation had emerged from this mode of training,
the two branches were combined in a single teacher. The in¬
struction was provided in two stages. First of all, during a
preliminary course, each student performed a series of exer¬
cises which gave him an opportunity to learn how to handle
materials, forms and colours. His creative energy was
liberated and he developed his individuality through manual
and artistic activities as well as through direct contact with
nature. During the second stage, the pupil acquired through
his experience of craftsmanlike production that sense of pro¬
fessional standards which would make him a responsible
member of a team. The Bauhaus thus transformed the
Romantic ideal of a return to craftsmanship into an educa¬
tional instrument which could integrate the creator into the
world of work and prepare him for a collective approach to
industrial activity.
But if the teachers at the Bauhaus believed that manual
work was a necessary part of the training of those who
would do creative work in industry, they disagreed when it
came to defining the nature of such work. For Gropius the
school's existence depended on the development of
marketable products in its studios and 'workshops. Kandin¬
sky, on the other hand, regarded this approach as insidious.
The motto coined by Gropius, "Art and Technology A k
New Unity", aroused vigorous opposition within the school. Y

> "Whichever way you look at it, it is crazy to call for the
coupling of art with technology", Feininger objected. "A
true technician will rightly shun any form of artistic in¬
terference, while the most consummate technical perfection
can never replace the divine spark of art". To which Muche
added: "Art and technology are not a new unity. They re¬
main essentially different in their creative value... The formal
artistic element is a foreign body in the industrial product".
Within the German economic system of the 1920s
Gropius's "new unity" had no chance to develop beyond the
experimental stage and become a social reality. Most of
those associated with the Bauhaus were only dimly aware of
this incompatibility. Lacking any clear idea of how to adapt
their work to the existing system of productive relationships,
they sought aesthetic solutions to the economic and social
problems generated by the transformation they desired.
They believed that an intensive search for a new formal
vocabulary could somehow compensate for the absence of
the historical conditions necessary for the fulfilment of their
ideals. But this vocabulary would soon be appropriated by
those whose clients belonged to an elite which loved
anything and everything new, while the mass public for
which the vocabulary had been intended had to make do
with its degenerate and incomprehensible left-overs.
For Hannes Meyer, Gropius's successor as director of the
Bauhaus, the quality of the man-made environment was
something more than a problem posed by the relationship
between art and technology. Meyer believed that if the
creator wished to play an effective social role he should join
forces with the workers' movement in its struggle to
transform society. This meant leaving the ivory tower of
aesthetic speculation, with its coterie of initiates, and
creating standard products for the poorest members of the
community. This new direction in the policy of the Bauhaus
brought a greater emphasis on the exact sciences in the
school's curriculum and the stepping up of productive work.
But by those for whom the Bauhaus was nothing if not a
citadel of art, the new approach was seen as a betrayal.
Meyer paid dearly for his ideas; two years and three months
after being appointed he was dismissed. Nonetheless, dur¬
ing his term of office he developed a system of polytechnic
education which reconciled thought and action and which
attached a higher value to the creative zeal of students and
teachers alike.
The incessant fertility of this short-lived institution was a
product of the political and educational climate of the times.
The Bauhaus expressed in microcosmic form the immense
hope for a new life which inspired millions of people after the
First World War. Without this hope, which arose from the
collapse of the great European monarchies, from the birth of
new nation-States, from great progress in the development
of productive forces, the Bauhaus would certainly not have
been what it became. The abundance, variety and boldness
of the experiments carried out at the Bauhaus were largely
due to the conviction that this was an age of limitless
possibilities.
"Art and the people should form a single unity; art should
no longer be the privilege of a minority but a source of hap¬
piness and life for the masses; our goal is to integrate the
arts in great architecture." Thus, in 1919, proclaimed the
Arbeitsrat für Kunst (Work Council for Art) of which Walter
Gropius was a member. The work of the Bauhaus can be
seen in this revolutionary perspective.
Ever since the beginning of the century traditional school¬
ing had come under fire, and attempts to develop a new ap¬
proach to education were being reflected in a host of ex¬
periments in many countries. The Swiss educationalist
Adolphe Fernere, the founder of the International Bureau of
New Schools, was crusading for active methods. In Italy
Maria Montessori had founded the famous Case dei Bam¬
bini ("Children's Houses"). In the United States, John
Dewey and William Heard Kilpatrick proposed that the pupil
should be placed in a context of authentic experience. The
motto of the school founded by Ovide Decroly near Brussels
was: "Few words, many facts". At Geneva, Edouard
Claparède was working on the idea of functional education.
Kerschensteiner in Germany put toward the concept of the
"work school" in which the child was to measure his crea¬
tions by his own experience; Lay and Meumann werei
developing experimental forms of teaching; Avenarius had Y

"The school must serve the workshop; one day
it will find fulfilment there" said the Bauhaus
programme of 1919. Rejecting the academicism
of the traditional art schools, the rigorous
Bauhaus courses combined theory with
practical training in workshops of carpentry,
stained glass, painting, metalwork, weaving,
pottery, stagecraft, wall painting, photography,
architecture, typography and book-binding.
The goal of this training was to prepare pupils
to create functional artefacts which could be
mass-produced in industry yet would still '
possess aesthetic qualities. After a spell of
factory work, the best apprentices developed
prototype designs for products used in
everyday life; many of these products were
later adopted for large-scale manufacture and
marketed. Ultimately, it was hoped, a new
generation would emerge to infuse reason and
humanity into the impersonal world of industry
and create a new art of living appropriate for
the twentieth century. A belief in unity,
creativity, simplicity, the functional conception
of the object these and other principles kept
the Bauhaus from being side-tracked into
"style for style's sake" and brought it a far-
reaching influence in industrial design.

launched the artistic education movement; Otto, Gaudig and
Wyneken practised in their respective schools global
methods, personality education, and community training.
All these educators were trying to answer the following
questions: What role should the school play in the develop¬
ment of society? How could the school be brought closer to
life? What connexion should there be between education
and work? How could pupils be encouraged to become more
active and spontaneous? What could be done to prevent
teaching methods from becoming formal and rigid?
The revolutionary events of 1917 and 1918 gave a new im¬
pulsion to this movement. The U.S.S.R. adopted the Marx¬
ist principle of polytechnic education based on the necessary
link between education and productive work. Lunacharski,
Krupskaya and Blonski directed the implementation of this
programme, while Makarenko founded the famous
children's communes. Under the new German constitution
the "work schools" became compulsory. A large number of
experimental schools were organized as Lebensge¬
meinschaften ("life-communities") which aimed to establish
close co-operation between teachers, pupils and parents.
The anarchistic "free schools" movement, inspired by the
methods of expressionistic art, began to spread from Ham¬
burg and Bremen. In these schools without any set cur¬
riculum everything the children learned was to be drawn
from their own experience. Different though the various
systems were, the intention behind all of them was to give
the child the active role in his education in a school with an
open outlook on the world. The Bauhaus was an episode in
this great movement; its distinction lay in introducing the
new approach into higher education.
The very structure and size of the Bauhaus contributed to
its vitality. Even at its biggest in 1929 it had no more than
197 students, a dozen full-time and five temporary teachers,
and one or two lecturers. The roster of all the enrolments
totals only 1,250 names. And yet, small though it was, this
school on the fringe of the public education system had a
relatively generous budget and was not handicapped by the
traditions and privileges which take root in old institutions.
Information circulated freely. There was a minimum of
bureaucracy, and responsibilities were decentralized to a
large degree. At the highest level, the load of teaching and
administration was shared. The size of the decision-making
bodies meant that they could act quickly. The school's out¬
put was also stimulated by the close contacts between some
of the students and the teachers (some of whom lived on the
premises), as well as by the atmosphere of militant interna¬
tionalism.
Furthermore, the Bauhaus broadcast its own message, in
the full understanding that a school must give in order to
receive. Through books, through its magazine, through ex¬
hibitions and other events, it sparked off exchanges and
debates which won its work a wider audience and at the
same time benefitted the school. It was this outward-looking
spirit which led those associated with the Bauhaus to
record, sometimes naively but always effectively, the
theories which underlay their activities, and to present their
works in such a way that they were accessible to the largest
possible number.
And yet, looking back at the Bauhaus, one cannot fail to
be struck by the contrast between the profusion of its
discoveries and the paucity of their consequences, between
the confidence of its assertions and the precarious fate
which lay in store for them. During its lifetime, the Bauhaus
was a constant target of calumny, intrigue and attacks from
the hidebound. When it was dead, the Nazis did all they
could to obliterate its memory. Most of the countries where
its former teachers and pupils settled did what they could to
render them inoffensive. In the undying controversy which
surrounds the legacy of the Bauhaus it is possible to discern
an attempt to discourage and to alienate those who are
struggling for a better world and to destroy the idea of pro¬
gress which still, in spite of everything, has a future.

Maestro computer
Exploring the new frontiers of sound
by Pierre Boulez
IT often comes as a surprise, and gen¬
erally not an agreeable one, to hear the
words "music" and "computer" pro¬
nounced in the same breath. Indeed, few
words evoke such widely different, if not
frankly antagonistic notions as the former,
with its connotations of free-ranging im¬
aginative power, and the latter, which sug¬
gests scientific rigour at its most strict.
Upon closer examination, however, the
stereotyped nature of this reaction becomes
apparent. Imagination is, of course, essen¬
tial to music; but composition, perfor¬
mance, improvization and interpretation
alike presuppose a degree of familiarity with
many different codes which only a long and
sometimes painfully rigorous apprentice¬
ship makes possible; without constraint,
discipline and knowledge, imagination is
PIERRE BOULEZ, French composer and con¬
ductor, is director of the Paris music research
centre IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Co¬
ordination Acoustique-Musique) and professor of
music at the Collège de France. Among his more
recent compositions are Rituel (1974) and Messa-
gesquisse (1976). This article is based on a paper
prepared for an international symposium on
"Informatics and Society", held in Paris in Sep¬
tember 1979.
liable to degenerate into mere fancy, "full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing".
As far as the computer is concerned, the
argument that both the nature and the
mechanics of- such a tool render its use for
musical purposes incompatible with
freedom of invention is, to say the least, a
very simplistic one. Consequently, before
we address ourselves to the question of the
relationship between informatics and music,
we must firmly reject the dichotomy which
sets the candle-lit garrets of genius in op¬
position to the complex institutions of
technocracy.
What, then, are we to make of the state
of affairs brought about by a technical ad¬
vance so rapid that its consequences could
hardly have been foreseen some thirty years
ago, when the possible impact of electronics
on music provoked the first stirrings of
interest?
To begin with, we should make a distinc¬
tion between attempts to enrol the new
technology in the service of musical creation
and invention, and the much earlier trend
towards the invention of new types of
musical instrument based on certain elec¬
tronic techniques. If many of the resulting
instruments enjoyed only short-lived suc
cess, this was probably due more to a lack
than to an excess of originality in their
realization; the possibilities they offered
were too limited. Nor did they always sus¬
tain comparison with traditional in¬
struments, whose output of sound remained
richer and more varied than the relatively
predictable and uniform results produced
electronically.
But once the concept, albeit a somewhat
hazy one, of "electronic music" was admit¬
ted, no time was lost in seeking to clarify its
implications for musical research. What the
new technology proposed first and foremost
was a range of measuring equipment which
could be diverted from its original purpose
and adapted, in a more or less artisanal and
ad hoc fashion, for the reproduction of
sound. The irruption of the computer into
what was essentially an aesthetic domain led
to a number of stormy discussions between
those who saw it as a tool which could be
used to strip the phenomenon of sound to
its essentials and then re-invent it entirely;
and those who thought that the machine
itself should be given free rein, and that its
immense capacities for absorbing, process¬
ing and re-transmitting all manner of infor¬
mation could be used for the creation of
spontaneous poetic "happenings".

In practice, however, neither of these
paths proved straightforward. The first
came to a virtual dead end when the tool
was found to be far from adequate for the
satisfactory synthesis of sound. The se¬
cond, in which serious and thoughtful plan¬
ning had been neglected in favour of
reliance on flair and dexterity in operating
the machine, became lost in a sterile and
above all wearisome maze.
In the meantime, science itself had forged
ahead. The synthesis of sound, which only a
short time earlier had appeared to pose in¬
surmountable difficulties, now seemed to be
an attainable objective, if not in the im¬
mediate future. True, a great number of
problems, whose complexity increased
rather than decreased with each step for¬
ward, remained to be solved, but they were
at least beginning to be understood more
clearly.
At this point, musicians themselves, who,
it must be admitted, had so far taken scant
interest in the development of computer
technology, were agreeably surprised to
discover that although the computer might
not necessarily propose a global solution to
their problems, its capacities of analysis and
synthesis could help them in a variety of
ways: not only in the investigation of sound
itself and the philosophy of music as a
whole, but also in the study of such specific
subjects as the language of music, its formal
structures and the rules of composition.
They discovered, too, that the machine
could help with practical, as well as
theoretical tasks and that it was capable not
only of writing scores for performance by
traditional instruments, but also of
reproducing the sounds written into a tradi¬
tionally prepared score.
It is worth noting here that a considerable
number of performing musicians are now
taking an interest in the relationship bet¬
ween computers and music (and not merely
with the aim of arming themselves against
future developments). They set great store
by the principle of real-time working since
they feel that use of the computer to bring
an element of instant transformation of
sound into a performance helps to preserve
the factor of uncertainty without which they
find true communication with their public
impossible. A piece of music, like a work
written for the theatre, constitutes an "ab-

^solute" which, by last-minute adjustments
at the moment of interpretation, becomes
"relative"; what creates the musical or
dramatic event is the passage of the per¬
formers along this tightrope between cer¬
tainty on the one hand and uncertainty on
the other. Any future application of com¬
puter technology to music will have to take
account of this need for uncertainty, and of
the question whether machine-made music
should be a finished product or, on the con¬
trary, merely a framework to be filled in at
the moment of performance.
In order to understand what is involved
more clearly, let us look at some of the ways
in which electronic techniques are, or might
be applied in the field of music, beginning
with the reproduction of sound. In a con-,
ventional sound reproduction system, vibra¬
tions picked up by a microphone are
transformed, or "transduced" into an elec¬
tric current, and then converted back into
vibrations by means of a loudspeaker. But
while they are in the form of an electric cur¬
rent, the sounds can be subjected to various
kinds of treatment; they can, for example,
be amplified or recorded.
Suppose now that we connect to the out¬
put of the microphone a device which
measures the current induced by various
sounds and which converts these
measurements into another scale of
values into a set of numbers, for example.
If we feed these numbers into a second
device, which is capable of carrying out the
operation in reverse, we shall obtain a fresh
current; this in turn can be converted into
vibrations, and hence sound, by a
loudspeaker.
But will the current leaving the
microphone be identical with that entering
the loudspeaker? Not exactly, because dur¬
ing the process of measuring the former and
transforming it into a numbered code, the
first device (called by computer scientists an
"analogue-to-digital converter") will have
"dropped" the fragments of current which
passed during the intervals between
measurements, thus failing to encode those
fragments for the second device (the
"digital-to-analogue converter"). In other
words, the output from the microphone is
continuous, while the input into the
loudspeaker is discontinuous. In practical
terms, however, that is to say as far as the
perception of sounds by the human ear is
concerned, and provided that the current is
measured at sufficiently close intervals, the
listener will be unable to distinguish bet¬
ween what goes into the microphone and
what emerges from the loudspeaker.
Suppose now that we eliminate the direct
source of sound, dispense with the
microphone, and replace the analogue-to-
digital converter by a computer, which we
instruct to produce a set of numbers based
on the same sort of values as those
measured earlier, the information provided
by the computer will result in synthetic
sound in other words in sound whose
origins lie nowhere in the natural world, and
which the natural world may well be in¬
capable of producing.
Let us take a specific example to make
this notion of the synthesis of sound more
clear. Percussive sounds, such as those ob¬
tained by striking the surface of a wooden or
hide-covered instrument, are very rich and
complex, but they are of short duration and
not self-sustained. They may be considered
as being similar to "noise" and it may be dif¬
ficult to fit them into any logical arrange¬
ment or pattern because they often depend
on chance and on the varied nature of the
materials with which they are made. With
the use of electronic devices, their distinc¬
tive quality, or timbre, can be produced ar¬
tificially and at precisely the required mo¬
ment, for the length of time required and
with the desired gradations of loudness or
softness; what is more, whole families of
sounds of the same tone-colour, linked by a
scale or an imposed system of values, can
be synthesized in this way.
Thus, solutions can be found to problems
which nature itself pronounced intractable,
the potential of existing sound-making
materials can be extended, and all the condi¬
tions are realized for a leap into the
unknown; although the latter exercise re¬
quires at least as much enthusiasm as scep¬
ticism, because we are still too attached to
"nature" (whether in the domesticated form
beloved of European and other civilizations,
or in its untamed state) to be able to imagine
or perceive without difficulty what is, quite
literally, "unheard of". It is certainly true,
nevertheless, that as far as the synthesis of
sound is concerned, the only limits are those
imposed by the imagination of the
"technician-performer" who operates the
equipment.
In this new context, the musician can no
longer content himself with knowledge bas¬
ed on the heritage of sound transmitted by
his own or other civilizations; he can no
longer rely on the amalgam of musical and
aesthetic notions which has, up to now and
notwithstanding certain developments in
language and signification, prescribed a
priori which sounds are "permissible" in ac¬
cordance with historically-determined
criteria. Moving like an astronaut into the
outer space of aesthetics, exploring and
familiarizing himself with the unknown, the
modern musician must in order to carry
out certain specific tasks have the groun¬
ding in mathematics and physics which will
enable him to determine the relationship
between "physical" and "musical" sound.
This requirement is not as extravagant as
it may appear. For example, when a com¬
poser learns to compose and arrange music
for a particular instrument, he is not ex¬
pected to be able to play the instrument in
question with outstanding virtuosity; nor is
he expected to be able to construct it, or to
analyse scientifically its acoustic potential.
He is expected, on the other hand, to know
the tones the instrument is capable of pro¬
ducing in a particular register, according to
the manner in which it is played, and the
practical applications as well as the limita¬
tions imposed by its construction. He is also
expected to understand, through extensive
background reading, its aesthetic signi¬
ficance within the overall context of musical
expression.
In the field of electronic, or "machine-
made" music, the need to determine the
relationship between physical and musical
sound, and to integrate this relationship in
the creative process, entails the develop¬
ment of new skills. Rare are the composers
who are sufficiently versed in the new
techniques to apply them unhesitatingly, or
who have developed an adequate intuitive
feeling for the unknown. What is required,
in fact, is a judicious blend of knowledge
and intuition, making it possible to look
ahead, and to extrapolate on the basis of
established data. But these same data,
derived from the familiar, instrumental
world, can themselves serve as raw material
which, analysed and then transformed, can
be used to produce results so far removed
from the initial source that the latter is well-
nigh unidentifiable.
Analogue-to-digital conversion which, as
we saw above, involves the transformation
of some physical quantity (in this case,
sound) into a numerical coding, in fact pro¬
vides data which the computer can process
in two different directions. In the first place,
relatively simple operations such as filtering,
the inclusion of echo effects, or various
types of modulation can alter the initial
sound, and lead to substantial transforma¬
tion of the original tone-colour. Although
the results obtained are sometimes very in¬
teresting, they are not easily controllable,
and their use soon leads to tiresome
monotony. Instead of being highly in¬
dividualized, particular and selective, the
timbre imparted by the instrument loses its
character and emerges after processing as
anonymous and banal.
It may prove more interesting and worth¬
while, therefore, to explore the second
possibility offered by the computer that of
analysing and extracting from the data the
parameters which constitute a given sound
or timbre. A whole series of techniques is
available in this connexion, the most impor¬
tant of which at the present time involves
identification, at a given moment, of the ex¬
act note produced by the instrument con¬
cerned. Once this "fundamental sound" has
been extracted, a process of synthesis can
be initiated, following with a very high
degree of precision the sequence of inter¬
vals monodic, naturally produced by the
instrument.
However, a certain number of scientific
and technical difficulties remain to be over¬
come. The richer the sound produced by the
instrument, the harder it is for the detecting
device (on which the analogue-to-digital
conversion depends) to cope with the dif¬
ferent characteristics, some of them of an
extremely fleeting nature, of the sound
received. The risk of inaccuracy is con¬
sequently increased, especially if it is intend¬
ed to extract these characteristics in a real¬
time operation; when this is the case, what
would normally be considered as a perfectly
acceptable margin of error becomes quite in¬
admissible and the whole system is called in
question as a result.
The notion of real-time operation is one to
which musicians are firmly attached, since it
allows for the inclusion, in the act of inter¬
pretation, of an element of chance, or rather
of opportunity in the most positive sense of
the term. This being so, it would appear
logical, if not indispensable, to consider the
computer, in its musical role, as an instru¬
ment just like all the other instruments
which depend on different techniques.
It should be noted, however, that bet¬
ween the emission of two sound signals the
computer must carry out about 100 opera¬
tions (additions, multiplications and other
calculations); but the time interval between
two signals is about 30 millionths of a
second. This means that, in real-time work¬
ing, no more than 300 thousand millionths
of a second are available for each of these
calculations.
No computer at present on the market is
capable of working at this speed, and it is
32

thus necessary to separate the operation in¬
to two parts. In the first stage, the computer
makes the required calculations at its own
speed, and commits the resultant data to
memory. In the second stage, it transforms
these data into sound signals, transmits
them at the required speed, and records
them on a conventional magnetic tape.
When the time comes for the concert, the
tape is available and all that is then required
is a tape recorder on which to play it.
The undoubted advantage of such a pro¬
cedure is that it involves relatively inexpen¬
sive equipment, which can be transported
without difficulty to the concert hall. On the
other hand, pre-recorded music is definitive;
it excludes all possibility of different inter¬
pretations and leaves no room for "chance"
during performance.
It should be possible, however, in the not
too distant future, to introduce micro¬
processors into the system, by means of
which pre-recorded music can, to some
small extent, be modulated during perfor¬
mance. Furthermore, it is possible to con¬
struct specialized machines which, linked to
an appropriate computer, can modify the
functioning of the latter to the extent that
real-time processing and the synthesis of
sound become attainable objectives. In this
case, the computer becomes a musical in¬
strument, in its own right, and can be
"played" by means of appropriate at¬
tachments such as keyboards, poten¬
tiometers or contacts. Since they can be
used both to produce sounds of their own
making, and to modify the sounds produced
by other instruments, these specialized
assemblages allow for individual "interpreta¬
tions"; the operator can combine these two
modes at the moment of performance.
Like the composer of electronic music,
the "technician-performer" must now cope
with new problems; he must have the basic
knowledge which enables him to under¬
stand the instantaneous phenomena pro¬
voked by manipulation of the machine, and
this poses the question of his training. The
rules for "playing" a computer differ from
those which govern the use of traditional in¬
struments, since the former picks up signals
other than those sensed by the human ear
or, at least, reacts to them differently. For
example, variations in the attack of a sound
which pass unnoticed by the ear, can be
detected by the machine, as can fine
nuances of range or pitch. On the other
hand, the ear can notice aesthetic subtleties
which leave the computer unmoved.
The computer can do more than create or
transform sounds. It can also schematize
and analyse the mechanics of musical
language, and convert music itself into
visual displays. This is probably the field of
application in which least has been achieved
so far, and the results of research, con¬
ducted in perhaps too rudimentary or too
academic a fashion, are somewhat disap¬
pointing. Following the example of the
linguists, who have used the computer for
highly specific purposes, certain musicians
have indeed attempted to analyse the
classical techniques of counterpoint and
harmony, but the results achieved are in no
way comparable with those obtainable by
any competent student of music who ap¬
plies his imagination and aesthetic sense to
good effect.
Why, in a contrapuntal composition, and
despite the fact that it obeys exactly the
same laws and interdictions, is one melodic

SEX STEREOTYPES
IN THE CLASSROOM
by Fay E. Saunders
IN most countries, parents, educators
and the public at large would protest
at the suggestion that discrimination
and inequalities exist between the sexes in
respect of educational opportunities. It is
still, in fact, too often held that there have
always been and always will be particular
and specific roles for men and women in the
organization of any society. They might add
that education should prepare young people
for these roles.
A closer look at what actually occurs in
the upbringing and education of children in
the majority of countries reveals that
organizational barriers have in fact been
removed in many places in recent times at
various levels of the formal educational pro¬
cess but that this is not true of the attitudinal
barriers. Certain attitudes die hard among
most of those on whom rests responsibility
for preparing the young to contribute to

society while providing them with the best
and widest opportunities for personal
development and realization of individual
potential.
Although much progress has been made
in many countries, the achievements have
not perhaps been as marked as they could
have been because of the great influence ex¬
ercised in the child's education by the home
and community. It is in the home that the in¬
culcation of ideas about sex roles is so effec¬
tive and therefore, even before children ar¬
rive at school, they have a clear appreciation
of the role they will play in the scheme of
things.
This subtle but very lasting influence con¬
tinues after they enter school and plays an
ongoing role in their development.
And from their earliest experiences at
school, the role learnt so well at home is
continually reinforced, often unconsciously
perhaps, by much of what takes place at
school.

> countries where few provisions for educa¬
tion for girls exist at any level at all. In 1976,
it was estimated on the basis of United
Nations population statistics that 79 per cent
of the 712 million girls in the world under 15
years of age were to be found in the
developing countries. Of these, the majority
live in rural areas where the problem of eking
out an existence forces most families to re¬
tain girls in the home to perform the
household chores and this occupies the
greater portion of their time.
In addition, time for education is not con¬
sidered necessary since women are tradi¬
tionally seen as "producers of food as well
as life-givers". As a result, very few girls
have access to education or skill-training. In¬
deed, a United Nations report states that
agricultural training for girls as compared
with boys was in the ratio 14:86 although
women make up one-third to one-half of the
world's agricultural labour force.
Even in countries where educational op¬
portunities do not present a problem, the old
idea of giving education to the boy rather
than the girl, if it comes to a choice, dies
hard. This is the case in some countries of
Africa where the burden of maintaining the
family, particularly in rural areas, continues
to rest very heavily on the women and girls.
Indeed, in spite of tremendous progress
made in providing education com¬
pulsory education in places such as
Nigeria and Kenya, the percentage of
children admitted into primary schools con¬
tinues to be low and the higher the grade the
lower the proportion of girls.
Enrolment patterns for the 6 to 11 -year-
old group show that in 1975 in many
34
developing countries (22 in Africa, 2 in Latin
America, 7 in Asia) fewer than half of the
children were enrolled in school. The picture
as regards enrolment of girls was even more
dismal, with 41 developing countries enroll¬
ing fewer than half the girls in this age
group. In fact, in 1975, there were 30 million
more boys than girls aged 6 to 1 1 enrolled in
school.
Within recent years, more and more anx¬
iety has been expressed, especially by
teachers and women, that the formal pro¬
cess of education should be reorganized in
such a way as to provide experiences at all
levels for boys and girls, based on genuine
choice in which the only criteria are interest,
ability and the will to succeed. No society
can any longer justify, on the basis of tradi¬
tional sex roles alone, the failure to provide
opportunities for the full development of all
its members.
It is worth noting that changes are taking
place, in real terms, in a wide variety of ways
and at different rates, depending partly on
the milieux and partly on the disposition of
parents, pupils, teachers and society at large
to acknowledge that inequalities do exist
and that it will be to the benefit of all con¬
cerned if changes, properly identified, are in
fact implemented.
Some of the most far-reaching changes
are taking place in the developing world.
This may be attributable, in part, to the
desire of such countries to divest them¬
selves of as many practices as possible
which are considered to be related to their
former colonial status. In addition, it is ob¬
vious that their extensive development plans
are geared to the full training and use of all
their human resources. For example, in
Singapore, teachers report that:
Girls... are not excluded from technical
and science subjects. In fact, their atten¬
dance and performance in technical
workshops on basic electricity, metalwork
and woodwork are compulsory in the
lower secondary classes. The girls are
never automatically channelled into
courses with domestic science subjects.
In certain schools, boys are encouraged
to become members of a special home
economics society for boys.

At the tertiary level also, young women
frequently choose courses in practical elec¬
tronics (e.g. television and radio repairs) to
the extent that it is not unusual for the pro¬
portion of women in such courses to exceed
that of men. On the other hand, in Sweden,
a country long recognized as being in the
vanguard of positive action for sexual
equality "not all parents are happy about
their boys baking cakes."
A major factor in the perpetuation of
discriminatory practices in several places is
the fact that some of those most influential
in effecting changes are unaware of how
deeply engrained are their own ideas of the
traditional sex roles and expectations.
Hence, while they openly deplore such prac¬
tices, they themselves unconsciously con¬
tinue to inculcate the very things they claim
to abhor.
One teacher-leader from a developing
country, who is very sensitive to the "rem¬
nants of male chauvinism" in her culture, in¬
sists that "discrimination between sexes
with respect to the objectives and contents
of education is no longer found, except that
the curriculum... includes such special sub¬
jects as are suited to women only, that is
sewing, cooking, etc."
Similarly, while many teachers in different
countries have been making vigorous at¬
tempts to remove needlework as a com¬
pulsory subject for girls at certain levels,
there are others who resolutely resist these
attempts.
It is probably in the area of the school cur¬
riculum, particularly at secondary level, that
the unequal opportunities offered to, and
provided for, boys and girls become most
evident and most widespread. The disad¬
vantages arising from this perhaps most af¬
fect girls. It is not sufficient to aspire to a
particular career or occupation if the
necessary academic foundation is lacking.
The consequent frustrations and disillu¬
sionment (especially when it is noted that
others have the necessary opportunities)
often result in a retreat to the traditional
role. Further, while we are not suggesting
that equal opportunities should be
synonymous with identical opportunities,
the common practice of deliberately plan¬
ning curricula solely on the basis of sex is a
direct violation of the concept of the right of
the individual to education. For unless
education is so designed as to fulfil the
needs and aspirations of the individual as
well as to provide the base for effective liv¬
ing in a society, the whole education exer¬
cise can be little more than a sham.
Freedom of choice should be the only fac¬
tor in determining educational programmes
once the individual has the ability and the
basic tools of learning, is knowledgeable
about the choice he or she is required to
make and is motivated in a particular direc¬
tion. Thus pupils who wish to follow the
traditional feminine or masculine orientation
should be free to do so just as they are free
to take different or even unorthodox direc¬
tions without being made to feel guilty or
inadequate.
In the majority of societies, the traditional
role determined for a boy from the earliest
stages is that of family breadwinner. The
education provided is, therefore, geared to
prepare him for this role. Schools guide him
in this direction and he is encouraged to pur¬
sue certain subjects which will provide the
foundation for higher and further education.
He soon discovers the specific qualifications
for which he must aim.
This is particularly the case at the secon¬
dary stage when he is expected to study
certain "boys' " subjects such as
mathematics and the sciences. In a survey
carried out by the Department of Education
and Science in England and Wales it was
recorded that at the fourth- and fifth-form
levels of secondary schools, 90 per cent of
the boys and 71 per cent of girls were of¬
fered physics as an option. Of these, 47 per
cent of the boys and 12 per cent of the girls
actually studied the subject. Similarly, 70 per
cent of the boys and 76 per cent of the girls
were offered the choice of chemistry with 27
per cent of the boys and 17 per cent of the
girls accepting the offer.
On the other hand tradition dictates that
girls should pursue subjects of a more
"feminine" or generally cultural nature.
This, it is argued, will better equip them for
their role as housewife, mother, helpmeet
and assistant. Hence, girls opt more fre¬
quently for such subjects as modern
languages, music and art. It is interesting to
note, furthermore, that even where girls are
not restricted in subject choice, they have
been so conditioned that many reject the
"boys' " subjects in order not to appear
"unfeminine" and possibly even, sub¬
consciously, to avoid competition with their
male counterparts.
There are other considerations, too,
which often limit choices where there mayP

( seem, at first glance, to be no curriculum
differences. In some countries, there are still
a number of single-sex educational institu¬
tions, both public and private. It is not un¬
common in such institutions to find fewer
facilities for certain subjects than in co¬
educational institutions.
In many girls' schools, provision for the
study of science and mathematics is not
as extensive as in co-educational or boys'
schools, whereas in boys' schools, modern
languages, music, drama and other cultural
pursuits receive less than adequate atten¬
tion. It is also worthy of note that funds and
facilities for physical education for boys, in
both single-sex and co-educational schools,
are usually much greater than those provid¬
ed for in girls' programmes. In addition, the
emphasis placed on organizing and projec¬
ting physical education activities for boys
can very readily be judged by the attention
given to this facet of school work in the
media in many countries.
36
Single-sex schools do, however, continue
to have a number of advocates even in
societies where equalization of social roles
between the sexes is at a very advanced
stage. It should also be recalled that in
places where strong religious traditions
prevail, such as are to be found among
Muslim people, girls either receive an educa¬
tion in single-sex schools or not at all.
Still, arguments stressing the harm which
single-sex schools can do to the functioning
of the individual in adult life continue to be
put forward ever more vigorously by several
groups, especially teachers and young
people themselves. That they are making an
impact is evident in as far as curriculum dif¬
ferences have lessened quite considerably in
an increasing number of countries.
It is also encouraging to note that greater
care is being taken in the preparation of
reading schemes at all stages, in an effort to
eliminate the marked sex differences which
were so typical, especially in the earlier years
of schooling. In addition, reports indicate
that many secondary schools are respon¬
ding favourably to changing attitudes on the
part of parents and employers and under
pressure from the young people themselves.
In developing countries, the need to make
the fullest use of all human resources has
probably been a very important factor in the
drive to overcome the severe shortage of
trained personnel. As a Nigerian specialist,
Pumla Kisosonkole, has written:
, The question is still being asked: what are
girls educated for? and, What should be
included in their education? There was a
time when it was believed that it was
enough for a girl to be educated to be a
homemaker, that is, a good wife and
mother. She was, therefore, subjected
and conditioned to a curriculum which
would result in a mass production of
homemakers. To a large extent, some
women still prefer the protected life of the
home, but grumble at the chores that the

hold no mysteries for
this Swedish
schoolboy, but is he
interested in sewing
or in the functioning
of the sewing-
machine? Too often
schools tend to
accentuate the rift
between the sexes by
arranging their
syllabuses in
accordance with
preconceived ideas
about the roles of
men and women. In
some countries,
schools are
attempting to
counter the notion
that there are such
things as "boys'
subjects" and "girls'
subjects". The
attitudes of the
children themselves
in this respect is
largely determined by
the attitudes of the
society in
which they live.
role carries with it. On the other hand,
there is growing a levelling-up of interest,
with men wanting to be involved in the
preparation of their families. I have lived
to see in my own society, young fathers
looking after the baby and preparing the
family meals, whilst the young wife goes
to college to study for her degree.
Closely allied to the problems caused by
differing educational programmes between
the sexes is the matter of career and voca¬
tional guidance. First, it would seem that in¬
sufficient attention is given to this in many
school systems. Second, guidance is often
provided by persons whose attitudes and
traditional orientation to the world of work
perpetuate and extend the obvious ine¬
qualities and latent discriminations in the
curriculum.
It is fair to admit that in an increasing
number of countries, there have been ef¬
forts to furnish information about a wider
range of occupations for girls but the
tendency to underplay certain types of
careers for both boys and girls along restric¬
tive sex lines is still quite prevalent. There is
some evidence, too, that unduly early
specialization combined with a guidance
programme initiated at too late a stage tends
to result in the choice of a career normally
distinguished by a sexual stereotype. This
has been further reinforced by school
systems which make no effort to change the
status quo.
Further, the whole scope of guidance and
counselling programmes needs, in too many
places, to be seen in far wider terms, making
provision for young persons to develop
greater understanding and acceptance of
themselves and their capabilities. From this,
more realistic career goals can be set. It is
encouraging to note that there has been a
considerable development in this area of
school life and that, from all indications, the
tendency to present a more useful and wide-
ranging programme continues apace.
The efforts of schools could be greatly
assisted by employers who should be active¬
ly involved with the school and other com¬
munity groups in providing a better
understanding of the problems and of the
need for change in sex stereotyping as far as
employment is concerned.
It is obvious that teachers play one of the
most important roles in the full development
of the individual child. It is therefore, critical
in any consideration of how discrimination
operates within the school for their at¬
titudes, perceptions and expectations to be
examined as to the part played in differentia¬
tion processes. To recognize that these have
far-reaching effects is not to detract from
the contribution that the majority of
teachers make to the overall process of
education.
However, teachers, like all other human
beings, are the products of the societies in
which they have lived and reflect the condi¬
tioning inherent therein. It is, therefore, to
be expected that, unwittingly perhaps, they
pass on to their students the ideas and at¬
titudes which are a part of their make-up.
At the early stages of formal education,
the vast majority of teachers are women.
Thus, they are very likely to expect their girl
students to behave, learn and respond in
the manner which is second nature to
themselves. They also expect the boys to
respond and to show interest in the way
they have "known" that boys behave.
A study carried out among Canadian
secondary teachers revealed a "tendency for
teachers to use their own behaviour as the
norm for, their particular sex on the dimen¬
sions 'active-passive' and that these inter¬
nalized norms fit the socialized stereotypes
(male active and females passive)". Fur¬
ther, it was pointed out in the same study
that "teachers observe noticeable traditional
sex role differences in the class-room and
feel that students want to be treated
accordingly. This evidence suggests that
teachers may be shaping sex role behaviour
along traditional lines".
Thus teachers provide learning ex¬
periences in keeping with pre-determined
concepts. For example, boys are provided
with mechanical toys and girls with things
which pertain to a domestic role. The dif¬
ferentiation in treatment is even manifest in
what pupils are required to do around the
classroom and school.
A group of African teachers observed that
in some places, especially in rural areas, the
girls "are treated as if they were there to
serve the male students and teachers". Fur¬
ther, in order to ensure success for the boy
who is being prepared for higher studies and
for earning a living, the teacher devotes
more time and attention to him than to her
girl students.
It has also been observed that girls whose
scholastic achievements are comparable to
those of boys, are more likely to be influenc¬
ed by social pressures and are often diverted
from their goals because of misgivings and
lack of confidence resulting from teacher at¬
titudes. It also happens quite frequently,
whenever restrictions have to be made in the
provision of programmes or facilities for pro¬
grammes, that girls' programmes are the
first to be considered.
The discriminatory practices which are
due to teacher attitudes are those which will
be the most difficult to change. There are
those who believe that they will only disap¬
pear with time as societies themselves res¬
pond to change. While there is, of course,
validity in this argument, teachers can assist
in accelerating changes by recognizing their
need for reorientation and by being ready
to carry out their own personal self-
examination to ascertain how their attitudes
and perceptions are in fact determining the
development of their pupils.
It is to be hoped that action will then
follow to dissipate those attitudes which
may be having a less than desirable effect.
Teacher training institutions should also
make it an integral part of their programmes
to help students to appreciate this problem
and its implications and provide adequate
opportunities to overcome it during this vital
pre-service period of preparation.

MAESTRO COMPUTER ¡continued from page 33)
line more pleasing than another? This is an
aesthetic question which seems difficult to
answer in quantitative terms. Nor do I
believe that the precise reasons will ever be
found. For centuries past, analysts and
musicologists have done all that they can to
prove to us that masterpieces are master¬
pieces, that the melodic inflections of one
composer are extraordinary and that the har¬
monic sequences of another are unique.
Despite literal analysis and an abundance of
grammatical explanation, no convincing
theory has ever been produced to answer
the question of what constitutes excellence
and I fear that the computer will be of no
help at all in this connexion.
But let us turn once again to the much
more immediate problem of training. The
entry of computer technology into the world
of music means that new disciplines will
have to be learned. Mathematics, computer
programming and the physics of sound
must henceforward form part of the cur¬
riculum of the apprentice musician. At the
same time, the new technology should en¬
courage the practitioner to perfect his skills,
and to enhance his own sensitivity to sound;
it should help him to listen more analytically,
to distinguish the components of a harmony
and to modify their relative importance, and
to perceive immediately the effect of this
modification to tone-colour; his under¬
standing of the role and function of timbre
will be facilitated accordingly.
Before concluding, I must refer to one of
the most urgent issues faced by non-
instrumental music, the question of its
storage and diffusion. The past sixty years
have seen revolutionary developments as far
as the conservation and dissemination of
recorded works is concerned; it may be sup¬
posed that the computer and the techniques
of digital computing will bring further im¬
mense changes in this field.
First and foremost, the possibility of
stocking digitally coded sound permits con¬
servation over longer . periods, since the
method of encoding excludes all possibility
of sound interference or degradation. As far
as synthetic sound is concerned all that
need be stored are the parameters required
for its reconstitution by the computer; this
will inevitably lead to a profound transfor¬
mation in the concept of musical scores,
and the characters and symbols employed in
their transcription. With regard to diffusion,
it may be hoped that the incorporation of
digital devices in electro-acoustic equipment
will enable music-lovers everywhere to
become more active listeners, and allow
them to express their individuality by
transforming and to a certain extent
manipulating recorded sounds.
From all the above, it may be seen that
music has nothing to lose from contact with
the computer. For my part, I believe that it
has much to gain, provided that the meeting
takes place on fertile ground. Far from
crushing or annihilating individuality, the
new techniques present a challenge, no
greater and no less than that issued by their
predecessors, to those qualities of inven¬
tiveness, ingenuity and outstanding per¬
sonality which have at all times been
necessary for the creation of new works of
art.

SOLIDARITY AND
SELF-HELP FOR THE SAHEL
Sir,
International Year of the Child 1979 made us more
aware than ever before of the critical problems
facing the developing countries and especially the
problems of the Sahel region of Africa. We learn¬
ed about the Sahel in geography lessons and from
essays by children in our class who know about
the situation there.
One of our classmates suggested that we
should create a group to help the children of the
Sahel, each of us making a regular contribution of
two francs a week. The idea was Immediately
accepted.
We hope that our project will help to bring a
little more food, technical, scientific and educa¬
tional assistance, and above all moral support, to
the people of the Sahel. To encourage other peo¬
ple in the quest for solutions to the grave pro¬
blems of our time we organized a special exhibi- .
tion in our school's documentation centre.
Would you tell us where we should address our
1,270 francs?
The children in our class would very much like
to make contact with other children in a school in
one of the countries of the Sahel.

An ardent reader of the Courier, I admire the
objectivity with which you cover the problems of
this tempestuous world. Your coverages of the
problems of pollution and the arms race were
unique. Children are the hope for the future. Why
should their future be threatened by adult myo¬

Director-General
Appeals for
Nicaragua's
Literacy
Campaign
On 24 March, Nicaragua launched a
national literacy crusade dedicated to
"the heroes and martyrs of the
liberation of Nicaragua". The
Director-General of Unesco pledged
support for the campaign in a recent
appeal to the international community
made in Paris.
Few nations had endured so much
physical and psychological suffering,
said Mr. M'Bow. Following the
earthquake of 1972 had come the
liberation struggle in which 35,000 had
died and 100,000 had been injured out
of a population of 2,200,000. In the
task of reconstruction, it was
necessary to mobilize all the country's
manpower, and the campaign for the
eradication of illiteracy had been
planned to serve as a lever for an
educational and social advancement
movement extending to all categories
of the population.
Beginning in March, the campaign
will enlist the services of 200,000
literacy teachers who, for six months,
will live together with some 850,000
illiterates in what the Director-General
described as "a stirring experiment
seeking to bring about a profound
change in the relations between the
various social strata in the country".
Nicaragua would not be able to
eradicate illiteracy without support
from the world community, however,
and it was hoped that international
solidarity would result in a
contribution of $20 million. The key
objective was the achievement of
general literacy throughout the
country, because illiteracy was a major
obstacle to conscious participation by
all citizens in the task of national
revival.
The Director-General said that
contributions in kind would also be
welcomed: pencils, paper, exercise
books and blackboards as well as
audio-visual aids, motor vehicles,
clothing, oil lamps, and foodstuffs.
Mr. M'Bow called on all
governments, public and private
institutions, churches, trade unions,
women's organizations and youth
movements, and "all those who enjoy
the benefits of education" to help
"those in Nicaragua who are
endeavouring to take their future in
hand".
Donations
from Austria
and the Fed. Rep.
of Germany
Austria has donated $10,000 to Unesco's
voluntary fund for development of
knowledge of human rights through
teaching and information. The fund was
created following a decision taken by
Unesco's Executive Board last November.
The Federal Republic of Germany has
decided to contribute $110,000 to Unesco's
World Heritage Fund for the period 1979-
1980. Established in 1972 in connexion
with the Convention concerning the
Protection of the World Cultural and
Natural Heritage, the Fund is used for
international assistance for the protection
and preservation of monuments included
on the World Heritage List.

Apartheid
and the
Falsification
of History
The myths used to justify apartheid
are analysed in a book entitled Apartheid:
Power and Historical Falsification, just
published in the Unesco series "Insights".
The book denounces the false assumptions
underlying this ideology.
The keystone of the present internal
policy of the South African Government
lies in the creation of "homelands": 72 %
of the population will be grouped in ten
"independent" black States, consisting of
largely arid lands that are poor in mineral
resources. Altogether, these homelands
represent 13 % of the total area of South
Africa. The whites 16.5 % of the
populationwill retain 87 °7o of the land,
divided up so as to give them almost all
the country's important mineral and
agricultural resources.
South Africa will then become a
"white" state, surrounded by "black"
satellites whose peoples will be deprived of
South African nationality and who will
subsist mainly on assistance supplied by
the South African Treasury.
This policy of "homelands" is founded
on a particularly well established myth:
that the first Dutch colonists settled on
uninhabited territory to which the blacks
only migrated later. According to another
version of this myth, the two peoples
arrived in South Africa at the same time.
But whatever the case, the blacks have no
rights either to the country or to its wealth
which was created entirely by the
knowledge and industry of the whites.
The author of the book, Marianne
Cornevin, refutes this theory with
arguments based on authoritative
archaeological and anthropological
evidence. She also shows that the history
of South Africa has been made by blacks
just as much as whites, and that it began
long before white colonization.
A new model of development in
which the only aim of education was
the development of man's potential
and in which education would
contribute to building a future that
was culturally more independent was
the main conclusion of the Regional
Conference of Ministers of Education
and Economic Planning in Latin
America and the Caribbean, organized
in December by Unesco in Mexico
City.
Addressing the closing session of the
Conference, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, Director-General, welcomed
the call by delegates for intensified
Unesco action on behalf of the
countries of the region. He noted the
advance made in Latin America since
the first education ministers'
conference at Santiago de Chile in
1966 and stressed that education has
been placed in the context of total
development which seeks to reconcile
economic growth and social and
cultural progress with the aspirations
of the individual and the demands of
society.
Twenty-six States of the region
participated in the Conference,
organized by Unesco with the co¬
operation of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Latin
America (ECLA) and the Organization
of American States (OAS). Fifteen

ministers of education and five
ministers responsible for economic
planning took part in the discussions.
In a declaration adopted at the end
of the conference, the delegates
affirmed that "Education is an
essential tool for the release of man's
highest potential to create a more just
and balanced society". They also
stressed the growing impact of the
mass media and urged that they be
used to make a positive contribution
to education.
The conference recommended that
the States of the region establish basic
education of the longest duration
possible, the adoption of a clear policy
to eliminate illiteracy before the end
of the century, expanded educational
services for adults and a gradual
increase of educational budgets.
Among the priority objectives
agreed were a proper relationship
between educational processes and the
world of work, the development of
integrated programmes on nutrition,
health, basic rural sanitation and
housing, as well as closer links
between school education and
permanent education.
A Book a Day Unesco publishes a book a day, a fact
revealed in an exhibition held in Paris
from 17 January to 28 March at the
French Institut National de Recherche
Pédagogique. On display at the Institute
were journals, books, studies and surveys
as well as documentary films, educational
recordings, slides and scientific maps.
More than a third of this production is
devoted to various aspects of
education methods, research,
innovations, teaching, lifelong education,
planning and financing as well as
reference works.

Nubia Medal
To celebrate 20 years of international
solidarity and the successful conclusion of
the International Campaign to Save the
Monuments of Nubia Unesco has issued a
commemorative medal, available in gold,
silver and bronze. The obverse of the
medal shows the head of Ramses II and
bears the inscription "Unesco Nubian
Campaign 1960-1980". The reverse
illustrates the Kiosk of Trajan at Philae
menaced by the rising water level.
Report on Communication Problems
Presented to Unesco's Director-General
On the occasion of the handing over
of the Final Report of the International
Commission for the Study of
Communication Problems, the Director-
General of Unesco, Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, presented the Chairman of the
Commission, Nobel and Lenin Prize
winner Sean MacBride of Ireland, with
the Organization's silver medal for
meritorious service to Unesco.
Thanking Mr. MacBride and the
fifteen other members of the
Commission for. their work over two
years, Mr. M'Bow said at a press
conference at Unesco's Paris
headquarters on 22 February that their
study, carried out following the decision
of the 1976 General Conference of
Unesco, had been undertaken in total
freedom and without directives. He had
chosen Mr. MacBride to head the
Commission in its important task
because he possessed rare qualities of
integrity and courage which he had
shown during a life-time devoted to the
struggle for freedom, justice and mutual
respect.
The Director-General said that the
report would now be published in
Unesco's official languages and given
wide distribution before the 1980
General Conference in Belgrade, along
with his comments on how its contents
might concern the future work of the
Organization.
Mr. MacBride said he was gratified to
report general and genuine agreement
among the Commission, who made up a
group representing the world's diversity
of political, ideological, cultural and
The chairman of the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,

conference held on February 22 at Unesco 's Paris headquarters on the occasion of the
handing over of the Commission 's final report.
socio-economic views. "While we may
have varying interpretations of the
concept and of the means of achieving
it, we are convinced that the
development of a new, more just and
more effective world information and
communication order is essential to the
progress of mankind", he said.
The Report of the Commission deals
with the right to receive, seek and
impart information as a fundamental
human right and it was in this light that
Mr. MacBride introduced the report to
some hundred representatives of the
media from all parts of the world.
A consensus was reached that
fundamental communication problems
transcended mere media questions and
were an integral part of the overall
socio-economic, cultural and political
patterns of today's societies, he said.
The Commission had focussed on
human rights and freedoms and on the
extension of the potential of
communications development to further
peoples' well-being and aspirations.

Convention
Adopted on
Recognition
of Education
Diplomas
Representatives of thirty-five Unesco
Member States meeting in Paris from 17 to
21 December unanimously adopted the text
of a convention on the recognition of
higher education studies, diplomas and
degrees in States belonging to the
European region, which includes Canada,
the United States and Israel as well as the
countries of Europe. To ensure
implementation of the convention, which
will come into force when it has been
ratified by five States, the contracting
States agreed to set up a regional
committee to consider progress and any
obstacles encountered.
The convention, which takes its place in
the work of regional conferences of
education ministers convened by Unesco in
Vienna (1967) and in Bucharest (1973), is
faithful to the spirit of the Final Act of
Helsinki. It is the fourth instrument to be
adopted as part of Unesco's concern to
promote the mobility of students and
teachers and evaluate their competence.
The previous conventions, the first two of
which have already come into force, were
signed by the States of Latin America and
the Caribbean (Mexico City, 1974), the
Arab and European States bordering on
the Mediterranean (Nice, 1976) and the
Arab States (Paris, 1978). Similar
conventions for the African States and for
the States of Asia are in course of
preparation.
The convention marks an important step
towards a universal convention, the
ultimate aim fixed by Unesco's General
Conference.
Unesco
has 149
Member States
Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of
Botswana and the Democratic Republic of
Sao Tomé and Principe became Member
States of Unesco on 29 November, 16 and
22 January respectively.
Unesco now has 149 Member States.
Asian Music
Rostrum Selects
Nine Works
Works ranging from short pieces of
vocal or instrumental folk music to full
length compositions, 77 in all, were
presented at the fifth Asian Music
Rostrum, organized recently in Baghdad by
the International Music Council.
The nine chosen by the selection
committee for special promotion through
broadcasting channels came from five
countries: IndiaRaga played by violinist
Lalgudi Jayaraman; IraqMaqams sung
by Salah Abdel Ghafur and Maida Nazhat,
and variations on a Maqam played by
Munir Bashir on the ud; the Republic of
Korea ritual music recorded on Chindo
Island; USSRexcerpts from mughams
played by traditional musicians on the
duduk and zuma (double reed woodwind
instruments); and Vietnam an excerpt
from "Hat bôi", the traditional music
theatre. The committee recommended
eleven other works considered to be of
major artistic interest.
The aim of the Asian Music Rostrum is
to make known through radio
organizations outstanding examples of
traditional, classical and modern music
representing different schools and cultures
of Asia and Oceania.
Black Holes:
A Cosmic
Mystery
Professor Chandrasekhar, professor of
physics and astrophysics at the University
of Chicago, explains a point during his
lecture on "Black holes: the why and the
wherefore", given at Unesco headquarters
in Paris on January 24, 1980.
What are black holes and how do they
get their name? These were two of the
questions answered in a recent lecture
given at Unesco Headquarters by an Indian
scientist, Professor Subrahmanyan
Chandrasekhar of the University of
Chicago.
A black hole consists of the remains of a
dead star. It is so dense and the
gravitational field around it 4s so strong
that even light cannot escape from it.
Hence the name.
Black holes originate when a star
collapses, a phenomenon which frequently
occurs in the universe. A star whose mass
is more than three times that of the sun is
too heavy to be stable. It explodes,
emitting in a few days radiation equivalent
to that emitted by the sun in tens of
millions of years. It then implodes and, in
the space of a few minutes or even a few
seconds, its total mass collapses to form a
sphere, several kilometres in diameter, of
enormous density (one cubic centimetre
weighs a hundred million tons). Matter
irresistibly engulfed in these endless abysses
gives out specific signals which
astronomers can now detect.
What happens on a cosmic scale may
also happen within the individual atom and
elementary particles could be a form of
black hole. Many scientists are today
working on this hypothesis.
Professor Chandrasekhar's lecture was
the fourth in a monthly series on "New
Horizons of Scientific Knowledge"
organized by Unesco and given by
distinguished scientists.
