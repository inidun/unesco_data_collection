Ahundred years after his death, the time seems ripe to
attempt to fathom the depths of Hugo "the man-
ocean", to examine his work with a more dispassion¬
ate eye and to bring to light the essential unity of the
immense universe of a poet who once described himself,
with more than a touch of self-mocking humour, as "the
Gargantua of things beautiful".
Although Victor Hugo remains, at least in France, part of
the collective memory, he is increasingly remembered in a
fragmentary, foreshortened way. The extraordinary activity
and interest aroused by the celebration of his centenary is
evidence that he has lost none of his force and vitality. Yet,
paradoxically, he remains both a poorly-known and a con¬
troversial figure. .
The very size of his work, whose restless tentacles reach
out in every direction, mask from our view both its central
core and its overall scope. Each of us sees him in terms of one
or other of the stereotyped, almost legendary images of him
that, not without some prompting by the poet himself, have
successively been projected the bourgeois poet, the
libertarian humanist popularized by the Third Republic, the
grandiloquent sage, the bearded, faun-like grandfather.
Today such simplistic selectivity is no longer possible.
With each passing year a clearer outline of the vast Hügolian
continent gradually emerges and we begin to perceive the
unifying purpose that presided over its creation; "Poetry",
wrote Hugo, "is Virtue", the all-encompassing truth, and it
is this sense of a coherent, irreducible totality that provides
the vital key.
We salute the man who was both a part of the history of his
century and of the future, who denounced the death penalty
and fought for the rights of man and for the oppressed. Now,
too, we appreciate the fuir scope of his graphic art and
recognize the artist in the writer and the writer in the artist.
It yet remains for us discover Hugo the poet. Looking
beyond ideological and aesthetic prejudices and reserva¬
tions, we have to seek out the inspired virtuoso of the word,
one of the greatest because one of those to whom we feel
most close. He it was who knew how to conjure up "the voice
of the shadows", the medium who liberated the subcon¬
scious of language; and to this extent he is "modern". But in
his dazzling use of everyday language he is also that "force
qui va", that driving force, that questioning, ever-hopeful
breath of life that spans the centuries.

<![CDATA[
A'modern' poet?
by Jean Gaudon
THE notion of "modernity" has lost
much of its usefulness as a critical
tool and should perhaps be dis¬
carded altogether on the grounds that it has
now come to serve merely as a prop for
misguided literary dogmatism or as a means
of disguising intractable difficulties of
reasoning. Baudelaire, who set himself up
as the, champion of modernity, based his
attitude on a paradox. For him modernity
involved the cultivation of a "transitory and
fleeting element" in order to avoid lapsing
into the "emptiness of abstract and indefin¬
able beauty". In electing to define what he
meant by modernity in an essay he wrote on
a water-colourist, Constantin Guys, who
dealt with transitory and modish objects,
Baudelaire adopted a thematic standpoint
or, to use an old-fashioned term, the stand¬
point of the subject-matter.
I doubt whether this approach is in any
way adequate for the study of Victor Hugo.
From a very early stage, in his theoretical
writings, he had already gone beyond the
terms of that dilemma by staying away from
thematic considerations. I do not know
whether he had pondered over the famous
line by André Chenier: "Sur des pensers
nouveaux faisons des vers antiques" (Let us
write poetry in the old style, but let the
thoughts be new) , which implied that poet¬
ry is nothing but an ornament, like icing on
a cake. My guess is that he had and that he
may have been thinking about this distinc¬
tion, which for him was devoid of meaning,
when, in 1833, in an article published in the
magazine L'Europe Littéraire, he declared:
"Une idée n'a jamais qu'une forme, qui lui
est propre" (An idea never has more than
one specific form), before going on to say:
"Aussi tout art qui veut vivre doit-il se poser
à lui-même les questions deforme, de langue
et de style, dans toutes les circonstances"
(Thus, any art that is intent on survival has
to ask itself about questions of form, lan¬
guage and style, whatever the circum¬
stances).
The right to be able to leave nothing
unsaid, in verse and prose alike, is, in
Hugo's view, the only genuine manifesta¬
tion of modernity and is inseparable from
considerations of form. The poet can be¬
long to his age only by improving the tool at
his disposal, that is, the language of the
nineteenth century, which Hugo described
as being "forgée pour tous les accidents de la
pensée" (forged to deal with all the irregu¬
larities of thought) and which he came close
to regarding as being forged by those same
irregularities for, as he said, ideas are the
"vraies et souveraines faiseuses de langues"
(the real and supreme coiners of language).
The poet's venture is a philosophical, ling¬
uistic and prosodie one whose different
parts are all closely intertwined.
The link between literary revolution and
political revolution which Hugo established
as early as 1830 cannot be explained away
by considerations of political opportunity,
and his poem Réponse à un Acte d'Accusa¬
tion (Answer to an Indictment), in Contem¬
plations, has to be taken literally. When
Hugo wrote: "Je déclarai les mots égaux,
libres, majeurs" (I decreed that all words
were equal, free and adult), he broke with
the tradition whereby poetic language was
considered as being a specialized form of
language among various other technical
languages. Poetry was, for him, as free and
sovereign as the people themselves. It was
no longer subject to ancient writ or to cus¬
tomary law and was free to demand its share
of the cultural heritage and at the same time
to seize the opportunities created by
chance. Thus the poet again became "that
man by whom the offence cometh". This
was an intolerable provocation. At the
same time as the Word took on a sacred
character the myth of the poet as seer is
central to Hugo's system poetry seemed
to lose its sacred aura.
This deconsecration of poetry, which is
indissociable from Hugo's political atti¬
tude, is particularly noticeable in the
broadening of his vocabulary which is often
chosen for its scandal value. It is a systema¬
tic affront to good. taste. By using the lan¬
guage of the gambling den, the brothel and
the gutter as a source of metaphors with
which to stigmatize Napoleon III and his
henchmen, Hugo called upon the entire
contemporary scene, summoned all the
facets of reality, and merged action and
dreams in a single cluster. His deliberate
stylistic incongruities enabled him to speak
in scandalous terms of what he felt to be
scandalous. The poetry of Châtiments has
the revolutionary force of something that is
utterly strange and unexpected and is all the
more effective in that the traditional
academic approach to political satire had

1802. Victor-Marie Hugo, third son of
Leopold-Sigisbert Hugo, a senior officer in the
French army, and Sophie Trébuchet, was
born at Besançon on 26 February. His two
elder brothers, Abel and Eugène, were aged
four and two respectively.
1803-1814. Spent his childhood in Paris,
apart from short periods on the isle of Elba and
in Naples and Madrid, where his father had
been posted. Started school in the summer of
1804. In 1809, became the pupil of de La
Rivière, a defrocked priest. In 1811, during a
nine-month stay in Madrid, was a boarder at
the "College of the Nobles" (San Antonio).
During this period the already strained rela¬
tions between his parents grew considerably

worse and ultimately led to a judicial separ¬
ation.
1815. Hugo was sent to live in a boarding
house. Began to write his Cahier de Vers
Français (Notebook of French Verse).
1816. Continued to live in the same boarding
house, while studying at the Lycée Louis-le-
Grand. Tried his hand at translating Virgil's
poetry and completed Irtamène, a tragedy in
five acts.
1817. At the age of fifteen, entered a poem in
the French Academy's competition on the
"pleasure derived from study in all walks of
life". Did not win a prize, but was cited by the
Secretary of the Academy in his report. Wrote
a light comedy entitled A Quelque Chose
Hasard Est Bon (Chance Can Be a Good
Thing) and two acts of a tragedy, Athélie ou
les Scandinaves. His brother Eugène began
to show signs of mental illness.

Planet-Eye, a smudged black Ink and pen¬

lines from Les Mages, a poem Hugo wrote
around 1854, when he produced the
drawing:
"The eye of the star In the light,
And the eye of the monster In the nightI"
/S
set artificial lexical limitations to what could
be expressed.
Plunging into the contemporary fray is no
more a poetic act than any other. It meant
something to Hugo only in so far as it
formed part of a scheme of things that trans¬
cended it in every respect and permitted the
inclusion of the whole of mankind's past as
well as its relationship with elemental forces
and its dreams for the future. The epic, as a
literary form in which the literal and figura¬
tive meanings are traditionally combined,
where history becomes myth and myth his¬
tory, is the realization of that aim. It is
consistent with the desire to achieve the
magnum opus that is all-encompassing and
with realization of its negative corollary, the
impossibility of ever achieving such poetry.
La Légende des Siècles, Dieu, and La Fin de
Satan, three poems which Hugo left un¬
finished and in which the formal discipline
of the poetic line is constantly challenged by
the temptation to explore the potentialities
of informal language, can be regarded as
the marks not so much of failure as of a
symbolic and unconscious decision not to
complete them.
In the Réponse à un Acte d'Accusation, a
revolutionary poet leaps on to the "borne
d'Aristote" to harangue the crowd. (Here
the word "borne" has two meanings: a stone
used as a fender to protect the base of a wall
or a gateway from being damaged by the
wheels of carriages; and, a boundary stone.
The allusion is to the revolutionary poet
Camille Desmoulins who, on 12 July 1789

1818. Hugo completed his secondary school¬
ing and left the boarding house to live with his
mother. He wrote an initial version of Bug-
Jargal, a romantic account of the revolt of the
black population on the Island of Hispaniola.
The main character, who is a slave and the
leader of the insurrection, saves the life of a
white benefactor, whom he calls his "brother",
and sacrifices his life to save ten black hos¬
tages. He is the first servant of his fellow-men
to feature in Hugo's romantic work.
1819. Awared two prizes by the Académie des
Jeux Floraux of Toulouse. Founded, together
with his brothers, a review, Le Conservateur
Littéraire, of which he was the leading
contributor for thirty issues. Published, in
booklet form, the ode Destins de la Vendée.
This, his first published work, was to give
rise to a sharp controversy among the critics.
Indeed, all Hugo's works were to be violently
disputed or defended to varying degrees.
In 1820 Hugo paid a visit to Chateaubriand
and It was on this occasion that the
famous French author and diplomat Is
said to have dubbed him "enfant sublime"
(sublime child). This drawing of Hugo by
Eugène Legénlssel, which dates from
1819. captures the young poet's air ofpre¬
cocious genius.
1820. Hugo engaged in a secret correspond¬
ence with Adèle Foucher, a childhood friend
who was not acceptable to his mother. The
assassination of the nephew and heir pre¬
sumptive of Louis XVIII inspired Hugo to write
his ode Sur la Mort du Duc de Berry, which he
published in booklet form and in recognition of
which the King made him an ex-gratia pay¬
ment of 500 francs. Bug-Jargal'was serialized
in Le Conservateur Littéraire.
1821. Hugo began to collect material for a
novel, Han d'Islande. He published, in booklet
form, his ode Le Baptême du Duc de
Bordeaux, son of the Duc de Berry and known
as the "child born of a miracle". The poet's
mother, Sophie Trébuchet, died after a long
illness.

1822. Hugo published his first collection of
verse, Odes et Poésies Diverses. The royal
household granted him a pension of 1,000
francs and, with this income, he was able to
marry Adèle Foucher on 1 2 October. Eugène
Hugo's mental condition suddenly took a turn
for the worse. Inez de Castro, a melodrama in
three acts, probably written in 1819-1820,
was accepted by the Théâtre du Panorama
Dramatique, but was not performed.
1823. Publication of Han d'Islande, a sombre
novel in which the love interest is paralleled by
the account of the frightful acts perpetrated by
Han, a monster whose only redeeming fea¬
ture is the affection he shows as a father.
Eugène went uncontrollably insane and had
to be committed to an asylum. Hugo was
granted a pension of 2,000 francs by the
Ministry of the Interior. In July, Adèle gave
birth to a son, Leopold-Victor, but the child
died three months later.
1824. In January, La Muse Française pub¬
lished La Bande Noire, an ode defending
ancient French archaeological treasures that
were threatened with destruction. Published
again in March in a collection of new odes, La
Bande Noire marked the emergence of Hugo
as an "antiquarian" or lover of antiquities.

The Spirit of the Storm before Gilliatt. This
pen and brown Ink drawing by Victor
Hugo, with a caption in his own hand,
appears in the manuscript ofhis novel Les
address the people). I do not know
whether Hugo had studied Aristotle's Rhe¬
toric, but it is not necessary to have first¬
hand knowledge of that work to realize that
Aristotelian doctrine is based entirely on a
quantitative system. The orator's discourse,
and to a greater degree that of the poet,
differ from ordinary discourse in that they
contain what might be termed "guarded
transgressions of language" which can be
quantified. In the case of Victor Hugo, the
fact that he felt bound to leave nothing
unsaid was scarcely compatible with such
constraints and limitations. The link he
established between "form" and "sub¬
stance" entailed evolving a new rhetorical
system that made it possible to liberalize
verbal transgression rather than altering or
bending the body of doctrine to which
French neo-classical poetry conformed.
From as early as 1834, in his references to
Mirabeau, Hugo had outlined a theory of
poetic licence which had nothing in com¬
mon with Boileau's "beau désordre" (fine
disorder). Aristotle was caught out at his
own game, as it were, since it was for the
sake of mimesis that Hugo disregarded the
traditional rhetorical precepts: "Without it
being our wish, in the words we have just
written to describe this man's (Mirabeau's)
Travailleurs de la Mer (1866) and evokes
an incident In it. The novel's title was origi¬
nally Intended to be Gilliatt le Marin ("Gil¬
liatt the Sailor"), from the name ofIts hero.
extraordinary eloquence, we have depicted
him by the very disorder of our images."
The use of the word "images" is impor¬
tant in that it lays emphasis on one of the
keys to the poetic revolution, and it is rather
significant that it should have occurred in a
text in prose describing its own creative
process. The image is not just one more
stylistic device which, in the view of the
Aristotelians, should be handled with mod¬
eration; it is rather the chosen weapon of
poetry, whether it be in a prose work like
Les Misérables or in a collection of verse
like Les Contemplations. Hugo's rhetoric,
however, cannot be reduced to an emphasis
put on metaphors. Its reliance on tropes of
similarity (comparison, metaphor, symbol,
etc.), which aim at producing a unified vi¬
sion of the universe, verbally translated in
closed, finite forms, is complemented and
sometimes contradicted by an even stronger
tendency to use figures of contiguity, which
have the opposite effect of creating an im¬
pression of infinitude and of opening up the
sentence. His favourite figure is accumula¬
tion (as opposed to enumeration, which
implies the existence of a closed series, like
the seasons or the Olympian gods). The

well as the more abstract concept of infinite
progression towards the absolute are stylis¬
tically expressed by long, distended, unba¬
lanced sentences which shatter the normal
syntactical patterns.
From the standpoint of a mimesis of infi¬
nite movement towards an unattainable
truth, the distinction made between verse
and prose has little meaning, firstly because
the prose may be poetic, but also because
the quality of the poetry may no longer be
attached to a particular kind of diction.
Although there is no lack of "beautiful"
lines in Hugo's poetic work, for he was the
master of the striking opening, the un¬
forgettable ending and of alliterative and
rhythmic skills, he seldom set out to achieve
maximum "poeticity". Booz Endormi, his
perfect poem, is atypical in this respect.
Flatness of expression is neither an in¬
advertence nor a sign of inability, but it is
one of the key features of his poetic
strategy. For Hugo, like Baudelaire, whom
critics picture, without reason, as the cham¬
pion of "pure poetry", the poetic discourse
is neither an unbroken song nor the juxta¬
position of a series of precious gems. It is
more in the nature of a trajectory consisting
of alternating highs and lows, variations in
the range of syntax and rhythm, and differ¬
ences in levels of intensity. Verse is there¬
fore not a pertinent unity but a vector con¬
veying the poetic current and relating to the
entire network to which it belongs.
Can it be said that Hugo's rhetoric goes
hand in hand, "involuntarily", with a logical
system that is also anti-Aristotelian? It
might be useful, in this respect, to examine
the role played in the poetic process by what
is known as antithesis. Hugo's obsession
with antithesis has been exposed to ridicule
without it having been realized that many
contrasting terms were not traditional anti¬
theses, contrasting, separating or classify¬
ing opposite notions, but disguised or
straightforward oxymorons. In other words
they are figures of speech whose function it
is to combine or merge into one another
ideas or objects that logic, or even nature,
keep separate. An example of this can be
seen in the line "Ténèbres et rayons affir¬
ment à la fois..." (Darkness and beams of
light assert at the same time...), from the
poem Voyage de Nuit, in Contemplations.
The phrase "at the same time" is perhaps
the key to a poetics that is intent on describ¬
ing the "irregularities" of thought. By up¬
setting the system governing the polariza¬
tion of ideas that would culminate in an
antithetical, Manichaean universe it makes
it possible to launch a head-on attack on the
principle of contradiction by introducing a
logical and chronological simultaneity.
Hugo is a difficult writer. A model pupil
turned virtuoso, he is also a complex and
disconcerting poet who often strays from
the habits of conventional Western think¬
ing. Even though certain individual features
of his work can be identified with recogniz¬
able aspects of the French cultural tradi¬
tion, his approach can still be said to be
revolutionary, because it is completely
coherent, with a consistency that is really
his own.
In A Celle qui est Restée en France, the
last poem in Contemplations, Hugo wrote:
Life and Times of V. H.
1825. Hugo started work on a play on Cor¬
neille, but was to abandon it. Promoted "che¬
valier" of the Legion of Honour, being cited for
"the noble efforts which he has constantly
deployed in support of the sacred cause of the
church and the monarchy." Accompanied
Charles Nodier and two other friends to
Rheims for the coronation of Charles X. His
ode Sur le Sacre de Charles X was to enjoy
considerable success in official circles and he
was granted an allowance to cover his travell¬
ing expenses. In the summer, Hugo, together
with his wife and daughter and Nodier and his
wife, undertook a journey to the Alps. On his
return, he wrote an essay on The Destruction
of Monuments in France, in which he called
for the adoption of a law for the preservation of
monuments threatened with demolition or ex¬
cessive "restoration".
1826. Hugo published a significantly ex¬
panded version of Bug-Jargal. He started
work on a play on Cromwell and published
Odes et Ballades, a collection of verse written
between June 1824 and October 1825. Birth
of a son, Charles.
1827. Hugo resumed work on the play Amy
Robsart, which he had drafted in outline in
1822, and proposed it to the Théâtre de
l'Odéon as being the work of his young
brother-in-law, Paul Foucher. Hugo accom¬
panied the sculptor David D'Angers to the
Bicêtre prison to see convicts being put in
irons. He used the observations he made on
that occasion to write Le Dernier Jour d'un
Condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned
Man) and Les Misérables. He completed his
work on Cromwell and published it with its
celebrated preface. This literary manifesto
traced the history of poetry back through the
ages and called for the emancipation of
drama from the ancient rules. It established
Hugo as the leader of the "new school". The
critics of this time, who were particularly
aware of the issues involved, detected in
Cromwell and in the ode A la Colonne de la
Place Vendôme which was published in
February of that year, the signs of a very
clear-cut political change. Indeed, it is from
1827 that Hugo can be said to have departed
from the stand he took in his early youth and to
have become, once and for all, conscious of
certain guiding principles from which he was
never again to stray.

"Deviens le grand nil fixe ouvert sur le
grand Tout" (Become the great unwin-'
king eye fixed on the great Whole).
Underlying this call for visionary poetry
we seem to recognize a call for the invention
of a new rhetorical order. The "Whole",
which is situated both within historical
time and beyond it, imposes a poetics of
the trajectory rather than of the object.
The act of creation becomes a means of
describing the movement towards an
"au-delà", a "beyond", that is destined to
- remain forever devoid of positive sub¬
stance. I see no objection to this being
called "modernity". Dante and Shake¬
speare are also modern. All things consid¬
ered, such a definition of modernity would
help us describe the literary phenomenon
more effectively than the frills and floun¬
ces of Constantin Guys. It would also
enable us to discover Victor Hugo and to
situate him in his true place, the "région
des égaux" (the region of equals), as he
describes it in his great book William
Shakespeare.

taught French literature at the universities of

manner of compensation and, in particular, a
political post at the Council of State and a
place in the administration." He was also
offered a significant increase in his royal pen¬
sion. However, he proudly resisted these
attempts to buy him off and set to work on a
new play, Hernani, ou l'Honneur Castillan.
Hernani was completed and was accepted by

censor, who commented: "It is a good thing for
the public to see to what lengths the human
mind can stray when it is set free from all

A novelist and his century
by Victor Brombert
VICTOR Hugo prided himself on
having been born with his century.
1802: "Ce siècle avait deux ans..."
(This century was two years old...) Every
French schoolchild can quote the opening
line of Les Feuilles d'Automne, a line which
is echoed in the concluding piece where
Hugo sees himself as the son of his epoch.
"Je suis fils de ce siècle" (I am a son of this
century). Son or is it father? Hugo's his¬
torical self-dramatization is not merely an
expression of solidarity with the events and
the destiny of his own post-revolutionary
period; it is rooted in the early belief that
the truly exceptional writer's vocation is to
represent his century and fill it with his
presence.
It obviously suited Hugo's imagination to
think in terms of huge chunks of time, and
to conceive of a siècle as a living reality. La
Légende des Siècles is his epic account of
humanity's adventure through history. He
saw a century as a massive unit with a life
and a personality of its own. Conversely, he
felt that great personalities embodied their
time. Hugo, so fond of double-substantive
metaphors, glorified the homme siècle. In
his dithyrambic essay William Shakespeare,
he affirms that every epoch is concentrated
(condensée) in one figure. When that figure
disappears, the epoch has come to an end.
His own fiction provides any number of
illustrations of characters who, in a less
exalted fashion, embody an entire century,
or are its anachronistic survivors.
Hugo's association of a human figure
with an entire century has of course specific
relevance to his conception of himself as
writer. There exists a link in the larger
design of the Book of Time: from Dante to
Shakespeare, to Pascal, to Voltaire, to the
advent of a new age ushered in by the
Revolution. Hence Hugo's very special and
self-glorifying view of himself in William
Shakespeare: as the poet of the nineteenth
century, he faces the poet of the sixteenth
century, as the poet of France he faces the
poet of England; but above all, as the su¬
preme French writer of the immediate post-
Revolutionary world, he is the poet of that
new world: the vatic, visionary thinker and
mythmaker of a radically new era.
Put in those terms, Hugo's notion of him¬
self associates by an inner logic his literary
vocation and presence-in-the-world to poli¬
tical upheavals and social change. The
nineteenth century, according to him, is
without precedent: it corresponds to the
personal quest for originality. Like any true
work of genius , it is the offspring of an idea .
And that idea the Revolution is in his
terms the grand climacteric ("le tournant
climatérique") of humanity, the turning
point in a providential scheme. Artistic
creation, historical becoming, and political
commitment, thus seem destined to exist in
a state of symbiosis.
It is hardly surprising that, in Hugo's
view, the thinker's or artist's function is not
so much to glorify the notion of the demo¬
cratic peuple, as to create it. The belief in
the possibility of projecting through art the
as yet unshaped but potentially powerful
figure of the common people remained a
constant feature of Hugo's thought. He
seems to have been convinced from his
earliest years that this was the specific mis¬
sion of the writer.
The nineteenth-century playwright,
novelist, or poet (Hugo was all three) had to
create his audience, and such an act of
creation had undeniable political implica¬
tions. As he puts it in William Shakespeare,
a text which in more ways than one is a
profession of faith, "the masses become the
audience, which in turn becomes the peo¬
ple." The prime mission of creative intellect
is to transfigure the masses, to metamorph¬
ose the mob: "construire le peuple." And
peuple is of course one of the most ideologi¬
cally loaded terms of the century, and one
of the pivotal words in Hugo's lexicon.

1830. Publication in booklet form of the set of
poems entitled L'Aumône, which was sold in
aid of poor workers and the jobless in Nor¬
mandy. The collected poems of Charles
Dovalle, a young poet killed in a duel, were
published with a preface by Hugo in the form
of a letter, in which he defined romanticism as
literary liberalism in the following terms:
"Freedom in art and society is the twofold goal
towards which all rational and logical minds
should strive in a single forward movement."
Hernani was performed for the first time on 25
February, marking the beginning of a four-
month "battle" at the Comédie Française be¬
tween "classicals" and "romantics". Adèle,
Hugo's fourth child, was born in the very
middle of the "Three Glorious Days". Hugo
settled down to writing Notre-Dame de Paris,
on which he was to work without interruption
for the remainder of the year.
1831. Publication of Notre-Dame de Paris, a
novel about Paris in the year 1482. Through
the adventures of a young gypsy girl, an apos¬
tate priest and a hunchback with a heart of
gold, Hugo exalted the civilization of the fif¬
teenth century, condemned torture and capit¬
al punishment and popularized a certain im¬
age of the Middle Ages. The government of
Louis-Philippe commissioned Hugo to write a
Hymn commemorating the "July days," [the
Revolution of 1 830]. This was put to music by
Hérold and was sung by a choir at the cere¬
mony held at the Panthéon in Paris on 28 July.
The play Marion de Lorme was at last re¬
leased from censorship, which had been abo¬
lished following the July Revolution, and was
performed at the Theatre of the Porte Saint
Martin before being published. Les Feuilles
d'Automne, which had been written between
July 1 828 and November 1 831 , was also pub¬
lished. In its preface, Hugo said that the col¬
lection of verse did not have any political
significance and asked: "Is there any reason
why art should not forge ahead, just because
the earth shakes?"

the nineteenth century is obvious in all his
novels, even in the ones which do not seem
to be political in nature. Bug-Jargal deals
with the 1791 slave revolt in what was to
become the Republic of Haiti, and is filled
with echoes of the French Revolution. The
violence of the insurrection is related to the
fall of the Bastille, as political forces seem
to take precedence over individual des¬
tinies. Hugo's career as novelist begins
under the sign of the fatum of history. Poli¬
tical forces will continue to determine the
thrust of his fiction. The barricades and the
street fighting of the early 1830s, in the
wake of the July Revolution, are the back¬
drop to the most dramatic episodes in Les
Misérables. Even more significant is the
insistent recall of the battle of Waterloo,
seen at the same time as the end of a world,
a return to the past, and a new beginning
in other words, as a major, yet problematic
turning point in the destiny of Europe.
Les Travailleurs de la Mer, even though
focused on man's epic struggle against
politics, the implicit references are power¬
ful. The background to Han d'Islande is a
large-scale revolt by mutinous miners.
Notre-Dame de Paris, though historically
situated in 1482, is filled with anachronistic
or prophetic allusions to the French Re¬
volution; it describes a world of transition
and change that corresponds, in Hugo's
mind, to the transitional nature of the early
days of Louis-Philippe's regime. But if the
end of the feudal world in Notre-Dame de
Paris is understood to coincide with the
invention of the printing press (the Book
was to replace the Cathedral), there was
also nostalgia for bygone structures and
values; and this historical duplicity (looking
forward and feeling backward) is projected
in the key chapter "Ceci tuera cela."
L'Homme qui Rit displays a similar political
ambiguity. It too talks about the past
(seventeenth-and eighteenth-century En¬
gland) while constantly referring to the
narrator/reader's present. The story of the
grimacing human monster a victim of
projects the image of the "predestined"
genius, Hugo extols the men of the Revolu¬
tion as the heralds of the whirlpool of ideas
known as the nineteenth century. And in
the acceptance speech at the Académie
Française (1841), the link between the Re¬
volution and the nineteenth century is made
even clearer. After glorifying Napoleon as
the providential child of the Revolution
capable of transforming history into an
epic, Hugo proclaims his allegiance to his
own time ("j'aime mon temps") even if
this time implies upheavals and violence.
But there is a flagrant paradox in Hugo's
notion of le grand siècle, for this notion
appears to straddle two potentially incom¬
patible fields of action: politics and liter¬
ature. Ideologies can lead to political deeds
(good and bad), and writing can of course
be a form of political action. But writing
and ideas can also be action in and by
themselves. Political immanence and intel¬
lectual transcendence are not necessarily
attuned to each other. In the concluding
Life and Times of V. H.
1832. Hugo wrote a new preface to the fifth
edition of the Dernier Jour d'un Condamné, in
which he argued that, along with the abolition of
capital punishment, it would be necessary to
institute a penalty based on charity rather than
on anger, in a bid to build a humanitarian
society. Guerre aux Démolisseurs! a vigorous
attack on the destruction of ancient monu¬
ments, was published in the Revue des Deux
Mondes. Publication of the definitive edition of
Notre-Dame de Paris, with a foreword and
three additional chapters. On 5 June, Hugo
was witness to the republican insurrection in
Paris following the funeral of General Lamarque,
and it was this event that was to stand at the
centre of his novel Les Misérables. Hugo also
wrote two plays, Le Roi s'Amuse and Lucrèce
Borgia. Rehearsals for the first started at the
Comédie Française at the end of the summer
and it was performed on 22 November. However,
it was taken off on 23 November because the
government thought it saw an uncomplimentary
reference to Louis-Philippe's mother in one of
the lines. Hugo published the play, sued the
Comédie Française and, in his address to the
court, portrayed the ban as the arbitrary and
despotic act of a government that was not very
sure of itself. Pending the verdict he gave up
the literary pension which he had been
receiving since 1823. He was to lose the case.
1833. Lucrèce Borgia went into rehearsal at
the Theatre of the Porte Saint Martin. Hugo
fell in love with Juliette Drouet, the twenty-six
year old actress playing the role of the prin¬
cess Negroni. The play was performed for the
first time on 2 February and was an instant
success. On 16 February, the poet and
Juliette became lovers, the beginning of a
love story that lasted for fifty years. In May,
L'Europe Littéraire published a long essay by
Hugo in which he analysed the evolution of the
French language and expounded his views on
the function of the dramatic poet in society.
Hugo then wrote Marie Tudor. The first
performance, on 6 November, ended in
uproar and "Miss Juliette" had to give up the
part. Hugo worked for Louise Bertin on the
libretto of an opera based on Notre-Dame de
Paris and published an essay in L'Europe
Littéraire on Ymbert Galloix, a young poet
who died of dejection and hunger.

Noël. This portrait of Juliette Drouet was

oceanic forces, is filled with allusions to
contemporary history. Captain Lethierry
launches his steamboat on a fourteenth of
July. A revolutionist in navigation, the old
skipper is in fact known as l'homme révolu¬
tion, and prides himself on having been
"suckled by '89" ("J'ai tété '89"). Topical
allusions to the world of the Restauration
(the fall of Villèle, the death of Pope Leo
XII, the arms sales to the Tsar for the
repression of Poland) are constant remin¬
ders that this allegorical saga, filled with
monsters and archetypal figures, is rooted
in history.
Needless to comment on the historical
and political focus of Quatrevingt-Treize;
the very title points to the climactic year
1793, the year of the Terror and the reign of
the guillotine. Even in those works not
10 overtly concerned with nineteenth-century
royal absolutism, but himself (without
knowing it) a born nobleman points to the
end of the aristocratic era.
Anachronism is provocatively inscribed
into the glorification of the nineteenth cen¬
tury. In Les Misérables, Hugo calls it the
"grand siècle" (a polemical expression,
since these two words are traditionally
associated with the reign of Louis XIV) and
he refers to the dawn of new ideas as a vast
"lever d'idées" an ironic image which at
the same time recalls and discredits the
despotic ceremonial at Versailles. But
Hugo did not wait to sing the glories of the
post-Revolutionary age until the period of
political exile when, converted to Republi¬
can ideals, he saw himself increasingly as
the inspired yet troubled apologist of re¬
volution. As early as 1834, in an essay on
Mirabeau through whom he self-revealingly
section of Le Rhin, Hugo attributes modern
France's greatness to its clergé littéraire.
The institution of Literature is exalted as a
spiritual power.
Hugo in fact develops a revolutionary
ideology all of his own. The saga and aspira¬
tions of the French Revolution are read into
the lines of a new providential text that sings
the adventure of the human spirit and the
prowess of the creative mind. Genius is to
take precedence over the hero, the pen is to
vanquish the sword. Thought is power. The
defeat of Waterloo is seen, in Les
Misérables, as a major shift in the moral and
intellectual perspective. The sword-wiel-
ders, the sabreurs, have had their day; the
time of the thinkers has come. William
Shakespeare, this paean about the nature
and destiny of genius, proclaims the demise
of the warrior-hero, the entrance of the true

giants on the scene of action. The opposi¬
tion of pen and sword, of warrior and poet,
is given added significance if one remem¬
bers that Hugo's own father had been a
general under Napoleon.
The paradox of Hugo's grand siècle helps
explain the central importance of Waterloo
in Les Misérables. For Napoleon's eclipse,
in the structure of the novel, is clearly ar¬
ticulated on Valjean's re-emergence and
ascent. The symbolic contrast is implicit in
the name of Bonaparte's early victory at
Montenotte a word coupling the images
of ascent and darkness (monte/notte) a
victory which coincides chronologically
with Valjean's descent into the prison hell.
Victory and defeat are dialectically bound
to each other. Waterloo appears as a hinge,
a turning point.
History itself thus turns out to be para¬
doxical and ambiguous. Political reactions,
such as the Bourbon Restoration of 1815,
are setbacks, but also fertile discontinuities
in the larger text of History. Is it not objec-

1834. Hugo published an essay on Mirabeau
as the preface to the Mémoires de Mirabeau.
In March, he published Littérature et Philo¬
sophie Mêlées, a collection of articles, essays
and prose fragments dating from different
periods of the writer's life. He wrote Claude
Gueux, an account based on the true story of
a worker who had been jailed for stealing a
loaf of bread and who had revolted against the
prison regime and had killed the warden.
Hugo's searing criticism of poverty and the
penal system was combined with a plea for
literacy and for education for the mass of the
population. In Hugo's view, the provision of
instruction would break the vicious circle of
crime and punishment. Since Juliette had fled
from Paris following an angry scene prompted
by jealousy and had taken refuge with her
sister in Brittany, Hugo set out after her and
brought her back to the capital in slow stages,
stopping on the way to sketch a number of
architectural and natural curiosities.
Donizetti's opera Lucrezia Borgia, based on
Hugo's play, was given its first performance in
Milan.
1835. Hugo was made a founder member of
the Committee which was established to
watch over "the original monuments of liter¬
ature, philosophy and the sciences and arts,
and their bearing on the general history of
France". He was to make very many declara¬
tions before the Committee in subsequent
years. Angelo, Tyran de Padoue (Angelo, the
Tyrant of Padua) was performed at the Com¬
édie Française and published. At the end of
July, Hugo left with Juliette for a one-month
trip to Normandy and, on their return, they
spent a further month in the Bièvre valley. A
new collection of verse, Les Chants du
Crépuscule, was published in October.

tively the fate of revolutionary thinking
throughout the nineteenth century to be
Janus-faced? For the Revolution, whose
interrupted work still remains to be com¬
pleted, is already an event of the past.
Hugo's personal experience mirrors the col¬
lective experience of an archaeology of re¬
volutionary moments: 1789, 1830, 1848,
1870. The double glance progressive and
regressive helps explain why Hugo's
thematics of Revolution are at the same
time future-directed and deeply concerned
with origins. The genetic motif is clearly
stated in William Shakespeare: the French
Revolution has spiritually engendered all
modern thinkers. "C'est là leur père et leur
mère. "
The paternal and maternai images may
seem banal. What is less banal is that
Hugo's work insists almost obsessively on
the themes of severance from the mother
and eclipse of the father. The weaning of
the Vendéen children at the beginning of
Quatrevingt-Treize , when they are adopted
by the Revolutionary battalion, corres¬
ponds no doubt to Hugo's autobiographical
awareness of withdrawal from the royalist
ideas represented by his own Vendéenne
mother. But though Marius in Les
Misérables, and Hugo himself, accede re-
gressively to the truth of the Revolution by
belatedly discovering their Bonapartist
father, it is equally telling that their father
has to disappear and that a hiatus is estab¬
lished.
The name ofMarius' father is Pontmercy,
the first syllable of which (pont) clearly
suggests the image of a bridge; and a bridge,
in this context, can be understood to span a
gap, to connect the past and the future, to
provide a meaningful legacy. But bridges
can also collapse, or be destroyed, suggest¬
ing the need for a new beginning. It is
significant that, in Les Misérables, father
and son never meet. The fathers are in fact
notoriously absent in Hugo's fiction; the
Condemned Man mentions only the women
in his family (is he not perhaps guilty of
parricide?); Frollo, an orphan early in life,
becomes a substitute father to his brother
Jehan; Valjean loses both his parents as a
child, and also becomes a surrogate father
to his family; Gilliatt, in Les Travailleurs de
la Mer, is only known to have had a mother;
Gwynplaine's father, in L'Homme qui Rit,
has died in exile; Gauvain, in Quatrevingt-
Treize, is also an orphan.

wilfully cancels the father's presence, sym¬
bolically erasing the entire 1789-1815 epi¬
sode as criminal and irrelevant. But more
significant, in terms of the paternal image,
is Hugo's affirmation in the very text that
states that all nineteenth-century thought is
a child of the Revolution that the Revolu¬
tion is itself fatherless. The section entitled
"Le Dix-neuvième Siècle," at the end of
William Shakespeare, begins with the
peremptory assertions that the nineteenth
century is answerable only to itself ("...ne
relève que de lui-même"), and that it is the
nature of the nineteenth century to dispense
with ancestors ("// est de sa nature révolu¬
tionnaire de se passer d'ancêtres"). There is
only one step needed to extend this negative
family metaphor to nineteenth-century
writers, and we can guess whom Hugo has
in mind: "The poets and writers of the
nineteenth century have neither masters
nor models." The revolutionary metaphor
suggests a declaration of independence and
originality for Literature itself. But such a
notion of being one's own origin, one's own
father, does not go without a sense of
anguish and even guilt. Subliminally, it

1836. Hugo was twice a candidate for a seat
at the French Academy, but was not elected.
In the summer, he went on a month-long
journey with Juliette and the artist Célestin
Nanteuil to Brittany and Normandy, which
afforded him the opportunity of indulging his
taste for topographical draughtsmanship. La
Esmeralda, an opera by Louise Berlin, with
libretto by Hugo, was first performed at the
Paris Opera in November, but was a failure.
1837. Eugène Hugo, whose mental condition
had grown progressively worse over the past
fifteen years, died in an asylum. In February,
Hugo published in booklet form La Charité,
the proceeds of which went to the poor people
of the 10th district of Paris, while in June, he
published a collection of poems entitled Les
Voix Intérieures. His annual journey with
Juliette took them to Belgium and Normandy
for one month.
1838. Hugo wrote Ruy Blas, which was the
first play to be performed at the newly
completed Théâtre de la Renaissance, in
November.
1839. Hugo started and then abandoned a
play on the Man in the Iron Mask, Les
Jumeaux, before setting out, for almost two
months, on a trip with Juliette, during which
they first went to Strasbourg and then
travelled along the right bank of the Rhine, on
to Switzerland and down the Rhone valley to
the Mediterranean. It was in the course of this
journey that Hugo visited the penal settlement
in Toulon. He was again a candidate for the
French Academy but, after seven inconclu¬
sive ballots, the election was deferred for two
months.

involves a death wish. The Revolution
remains for Hugo a deeply troubling
reality: he knows that regicide is but a
form of parricide.
Complicating this sense of guilt and
anguish is a latent fear of the masses, and a
not-so-hidden dim view of the otherwise
positive and progress-oriented notion of
siècle. What is involved is something more
profound than fear of violence, distrust of
the mob, or hostility to an increasingly
materialistic socialism. It is history itself, as
a grim process and as a catalogue of crimes
that Hugo the homme siècle is paradoxically
led to denounce. History is the brutal fait
accompli. And the key word siècle, often
associated with epic vision and Utopian opti¬
mism, also condemns the worldly spirit, the
sequential nightmare of history, the mur des
siècles of the sombre opening poem of La
Légende des Siècles.
Thus Hugo's lasting fascination with his¬
tory and the historical process is attended
by misgivings and anxiety. He comes to
question the validity and ethics of a historic¬
al perspective, while convinced that the wri¬
ter must speak for his time. Compelled to

confront and decipher the laws of history,
he also experiences an almost Voltairean
view of history as a cortège of unjustifiable
calamities. Hugo's tone at times reveals a
true sense of horror. He writes of the "tragic
sob" of history; he defines history as the
accomplice of crime, as the great spiller of
blood. La Légende des Siècles was to be the
great epic poem of humanity's quest across
historic time. Yet Hugo, using the word
siècle, also stigmatizes the commitment to
this time of history as a way of denying the
timeless life of the spirit.
Le siècle ingrat, le siècle affreux, le siècle
immonde
A triple indictment such as this helps to
put into proper perspective the prophetic
vision of Hugo as he looks forward into the
future: the century that lies ahead. We are
reminded of the idealistic student-revolu¬
tionary Enjolras who, from atop the barri¬
cades in Les Misérables, as he is about to lay
down his life for a political cause, prophe¬
sies a time when it will be possible to put an
end to the political adventure, emerge from
the nightmare of history, and make an exit
from the "forest of events."
Is this not precisely the ultimate paradox
of Hugo, l'homme siècle: that the man most
committed to the history and politics of his
day should also be the one who most steadi¬
ly dreamed of transcending them?

1840. The election to the Academy was held,
but Hugo was again beaten. In May, he pub¬
lished a new volume of poetry, Les Rayons et
les Ombres. He went on a journey to the
Rhine with Juliette. Throughout the tour, Hugo
kept a voluminous travel "journal", which he
sent back to his family as he proceeded, and
he made a large number of drawings in his
sketchbook and album and on the manuscript
itself. On his return to Paris, his attention was
taken up with the repatriation of Napoleon's
ashes. On 1 5 December, the actual day of the
official ceremony, he published his verses on
Le Retour de l'Empereuras a booklet, and this
was followed one week later by a complete
collection of poems on Napoleon.
1 841 . At his fourth attempt, Hugo was elected
a member of the French Academy on the first
ballot, although by a very small majority. In
June, he was formally received into the
Academy and delivered an address that was
both political and literary in import. He devoted
himself to Le Rhin, a book based on his
travels to Champagne in 1838 and to the
Rhine in 1840.
1842. Le Rhin was published in January. In
June, Hugo was elected Director of the
Academy and, in that capacity, tendered the
official condolences of the entire French Insti¬
tute to Louis-Philippe on the occasion of the
accidental death of his eldest son. He
began and completed a new play, Les
Burgraves, which was accepted by the
Comédie Française.

1 843. On 1 5 February, Hugo had the "distres¬
sing happiness to give his daughter's hand in
mariage". Léopoldine married Charles Vac-
querie, the son of a Le Havre shipowner. Les '
Burgraves was performed for the first time on
7 March, but was regarded as a failure. In
July, Hugo paid a lightning visit to Léopoldine
and her family before leaving on a long jour¬
ney to Spain and the Pyrenees. On 4 Septem¬
ber, Léopoldine and her husband, and her
husband's uncle and nephew, were drowned
in the river Seine at Villequier. Hugo learnt the
news from the press five days after the
tragedy and returned to Paris to be with his
stricken family. The only glimmer of light in
that gloomy year was the relationship which
Hugo struck up with Léonie Biard.
1844. Hugo's literary output was confined to a
small number of poems, most of which were
inspired by his love for Léonie. Hugo became
a close friend and confidant of the King.

1846. At the beginning of February, Hugo
re-emerged from his state of réclusion to
attend a meeting of the Monuments Commit¬
tee. Shortly afterwards, he made his first
speech before the Chamber of Peers on the
ownership of works of art. He visited the Con¬
ciergerie prison, where he took copious notes.
Claire Pradier, the only child of Juliette
Drouet, died at the age of twenty. Hugo, who
had always acted as though he were the
adoptive father of the young woman, shared
Juliette's grief. He visited Villequierforthe first
time. He continued to write poetry and work on
his novel.
1847. Hugo visited the La Roquette prison,
where he had a conversation with a prisoner
under sentence of death. He worked on
speeches dealing with penal reform and child
labour, and spoke in the Chamber of Peers in
favour of subsidies for the theatre and the
abrogation of the law exiling the Bonaparte

much less to fear from that princely family
than from the starving populace. He became
friendly with the actress Alice Ozy and went
on a one-week trip to Normandy with Juliette,
passing through Villequier, which prompted
him to write the celebrated verses starting

Léopoldine and the Book of Hours, a por¬
trait of Léopoldine Hugo aged eleven, by
Auguste de Châtillon. Her accidental
death by drowning, near the village of Vil¬
lequier, between Rouen and Le Havre,

blow to Hugo. His paternal love for Léopol¬
dine was echoed in the relationship be¬
tween Jean Valjean and Coserte in Les
Misérables and inspired one of his finest
poems, Demain, dès l'aube, à l'heure où
blanchit la campagne (Les Contempla¬
tions). The house of Léopoldine's parents-
in-law, at Villequier, on the banks of the
Seine, has become a museum, a Victor
Hugo shrine comparable to his house in
the Place des Vosges, Paris, and Haute-
ville House, Guernsey.

The sack of the Summer Palace
To Captain Butler
Hauteville House,
25 November, 1861
You ask my opinion, Sir, about the China
expedition. You consider this expedition to
be honourable and glorious, and you have
the kindness to attach some consideration
to my feelings; according to you, the China
expedition, carried out jointly under the
flags of Queen Victoria and the Emperor
Napoleon, is a glory to be shared between
France and England, and you wish to know
how much approval I feel I can give to this
English and French victory.
Since you wish to know my opinion, here
it is:
There was, in a corner of the world, a
wonder of the world ; this wonder was called
the Summer Palace. Art has two principles,
the Idea, which produces European art, and
the Chimera, which produces oriental art.
The Summer Palace was to chimerical art
what the Parthenon is to ideal art. All that
can be begotten of the imagination of an
almost extra-human people was there. It
was not a single, unique work like the Parth¬
enon. It was a kind of enormous model of
the chimera, if the chimera can have a mod¬
el. Imagine some inexpressible construc¬
tion, something like a lunar building, and
you will have the Summer Palace. Build a
dream with marble, jade, bronze and porce¬
lain, frame it with cedar wood, cover it with
precious stones, drape it with silk, make it
here a sanctuary, there a harem, elsewhere
a citadel, put gods there, and monsters,
varnish it, enamel it, gild it, paint it, have
architects who are poets build the thousand
and one dreams of the thousand and one
nights, add gardens, basins, gushing water
and foam, swans, ibis, peacocks, suppose in
a word a sort of dazzling cavern of human
fantasy with the face of a temple and palace,
such was this building. The slow work of
generations had been necessary to create it.
This edifice, as enormous as a city, had been
built by the centuries, for whom? For the
peoples. For the work of time belongs to
man. Artists, poets and philosophers knew
the Summer Palace; Voltaire talks of it.
People spoke of the Parthenon in Greece,
the pyramids in Egypt, the Coliseum in
Rome, Notre-Dame in Paris, the Summer
Palace in the Orient. If people did not see it
they imagined it. It was a kind of
tremendous unknown masterpiece, glimp¬
sed from the distance in a kind of twilight,
like a silhouette of the civilization of Asia
on the horizon of the civilization of Europe.
This wonder has disappeared.
One day two bandits entered the Summer
Palace. One plundered, the other burned.
Victory can be a thieving woman, or so it
seems. The devastation of the Summer
Palace was accomplished by the two victors
acting jointly. Mixed up in all this is the
name of Elgin, which inevitably calls to
mind the Parthenon. What was done to the
Parthenon was done to the Summer Palace,
more thoroughly and better, so that nothing
of it should be left. All the treasures of all
our cathedrals put together could not equal
this formidable and splendid museum of the .
Orient. It contained not only masterpieces
of art, but masses of jewelry. What a great
exploit, what a windfall! One of the two
victors filled his pockets; when the other
saw this he filled his coffers. And back they
came to Europe, arm in arm, laughing
away. Such is the story of the two bandits.
We Europeans are the civilized ones, and
for us the Chinese are the barbarians. This
is what civilization has done to barbarism.
Before history, one of the two bandits
will be called France; the other will be
called England. But I protest, and I thank
you for giving me the opportunity! the
crimes of those who lead are not the fault of
those who are led; Governments are some¬
times bandits, peoples never.
The French empire has pocketed half of
this victory, and today with a kind of prop¬
rietorial naivety it displays the splendid
bric-à-brac of the Summer Palace. I hope
that a day will come when France, delivered
and cleansed, will return this booty to de¬
spoiled China.
Meanwhile, there is a theft and two
thieves.
I take note.
This, Sir, is how much approval I give to
the China expedition.

<![CDATA[
African first nights
by Jacques Téphany
IN 1866, during his eleventh year of exile
in Guernsey, Hugo wrote, in two
months, a four-act, prose melodrama
entitled Mille Francs de Récompense (A
Thousand Francs Reward). Was the world-
renowned author of Les Misérables at long
last going to start writing for the theatre
again, something he had not done since the
failure of his play Les Burgraves in 1843?
This, at any rate, was what the exiled
writer's friends were saying in Paris, where
this event was awaited with the greatest
impatience. Instead, the visionary of
Guernsey put away the large blue sheets of
paper, covered with his extraordinary hand¬
writing, in the bottom of a trunk, declaring
that the censors would not pass it for publi¬
cation, and adding, laconically, "I wrote it
to rid myself of an obsession with an idea".
The work was among a collection of
plays, entitled Théâtre en Liberté, that re¬
mained unpublished during Hugo's life¬
time. It resurfaced in 1934, when it was
published for the first time. It was not
staged until 1961, when it was put on in
Strasbourg by Hubert Gignoux. Twenty-
four years later, on the occasion of the
centenary of the author's death, our turn
came to stage the ballad of Glapieu.
What is it about?
The scene is set in the Paris of the 1820s.
An outlawed convict named Glapieu a I
Jean Valjean with a sense of humour I
creeps stealthily over the rooftops of the I
city. He is hungry, but manages to summon I
up just enough strength to bid defiance to I
God : "The first good deed I have the oppor- I
tunity to do I shall do at once. That will put I
God in the wrong."
Glapieu glances through the window of a I
wretched attic. Inside he sees an old man I
who is slowly dying, surrounded by the
trophies he won as a soldier of the Imperial I
army. Only his widowed daughter, Etien- I
nette, and his grand-daughter, Cyprienne, I
remain to watch over him in his poverty. In I
order to support them Major Gédouard is I
reduced to giving music lessons. This was
appalling, naked destitution something
men perhaps may bear, but not women.
Cyprienne is in love with a young bank I
clerk, Edgar Marc, who is employed by the I
rich banker Baron Puencarral. And it is in I
the name of this same Puencarral that all I
Gédouard's furniture, including his piano, I
has been seized. The agent of this despic- I
able act is a businessman named Rousse- I
line, the pitiless incarnation of the spirit of I
the Restoration period. Rousseline decides
to teach Etiennette a lesson in realism if I
you want to be rich, do not look as though
you are poor, and if you do not wish to I
condemn your daughter to destitution, give I
her to me and I shall marry her. At the end I
of her tether, like Fantine in Les Misera- I
bles, Etiennette leaves the choice to her I
16 daughter. But Cyprienne, like Cosette in I
the same novel, obeys the voice of youth
and refuses the offer. At this point Glapieu,
who has been concealed the while in a
cupboard, like the lover in any trivial bed¬
room farce, emerges crying "Well said, my
dear!" The tone of the play is set.
I shall not go over all the ins and outs of
the melodrama (which reveals that the
banker is Etiennette's long-lost husband
and Cyprienne's father), but content myself
with pointing out that the whole spirit of the
play is personified in that of the central
character, Glapieu. The convict is neither
saint nor martyr. He is the street-urchin
Gavroche at fifty, he is the spirit of Paris, he
is the bitter, poetic laughter of the people.
If the convict who is another kind of
exile is, in the eyes of official morality,
guilty of every shortcoming, his position
gives him an advantage over the honest
bourgeois, he is "on the outside". Glapieu
on his rooftop is Hugo on his island. They
can both play at tearing away the mask of
honesty. The judge says: "You are a thief."
What does Glapieu say? "I stole because I
was hungry." Justice, like the army, does
not want to know, it sticks to the bare facts.
So Glapieu is arrested at the age of sixteen
and jailed for several years , long enough for
a lad to get to know about politics.
In Mille Francs de Récompense the mira¬
cle is that the hero's soul is still that of a
child. Humour, which in Hugo is the cour¬
tesy of despair, is also the mark of youth.
And has the stage any better tool than
laughter for showing reality in a new light?
In a flash it reveals what manifestos, exile,
epics and novels are slow to analyse. It is
grace as against ponderousness. Our pre¬
sentation in the theatre was based on this
duality.
First the melodramatic aspect; we had to
believe in it and put all our heart into it.
Melodrama is a struggle between the ideal
and the real, between magnanimity and
money, between youth and the past. Bad
melodrama depicts absolute good against
absolute evil, and this confrontation often
results in equally absolute boredom. But
good melodrama and Mille Francs de
Récompense is a masterpiece of its kind
shows that good and evil are relative.
We take to Edgar Marc, for example,
because he loves Cyprienne; yet he is the
very stuff of which the bourgeois are made
and will become a cold, forbiddingly worthy
man. Rousseline, who is a "bad" character,
has the same advantage as the convict of
being on the outside; and he has, too, his
intellectual honesty. The other bad charac-
Life and Times of V. H.
1848. The July Monarchy fell on 22 February
and the Republic was proclaimed. Hugo, who
had tried in vain to have the Duchess Hélène
d'Orléans appointed regent, was offered the
post of Mayor of the 8th district of Paris, but
he refused. In June, Hugo was elected to the
Constituent Assembly and, during the "June
days" exposed himself to the gunfire of the
insurgents in an endeavour to restore order.
His activities until the end of the year were
almost entirely political. He intervened in
favour of political prisoners threatened with
deportation or death; he spoke against the
restrictions placed on the freedom of the press
and for the provision of financial support for
theatres, which had remained closed since
the June uprising, for the abolition of the death
penalty and against theatre censorship. He
also voted in favour of the inclusion of a
reference to Human Rights in the preamble to
the Constitution and against any impairment
of universal suffrage. In November, he made
an important speech on the budgetary restric¬
tions which it was proposed to impose on
schools, universities and cultural institutions,
and on the subsidies granted to the sciences
and arts, and warned the elected representa¬
tives against trying to make savings on "intel¬
lectual weil-being" by declaring: "It is neces-

sary to raise man's spirit and guide it towards
God, towards awareness, beauty, justice and
truth, towards disinterested acts and great¬
ness. It is by doing this and this alone that
you will find man at peace with himself and
hence at peace with society". The Presiden¬
tial elections were held in December. Hugo,
who had been impressed by a book entitled
L'Extinction du Paupérisme (the abolition of
dire poverty) voted for its author, Louis-Napo¬
léon Bonaparte, who won the election over
Cavaignac, Lamartine and others.

completion of the Louvre Museum, the aboli¬

elected to the new Legislative Assembly, in
which he made his mark by delivering an
explosive speech on La Misère (poverty). In
August, Hugo was elected Chairman of the
International Peace Congress, at which he
made the opening and closing addresses,
and in October he protested against the re¬

the clergy the monopoly of public education
was rejected by Hugo as being a monstrous
retrograde step. In his view, the ideal con¬
sisted of free, secular and, above all else,
compulsory education, where "the gates of
knowledge would all be wide open to all
brains". The forcible language of the dis¬
course On the Freedom of Education was
followed by other stands which ultimately
alienated Hugo from the conservative par¬
liamentarians. These included declarations
on the restrictions placed on voting rights,
against deportation and in favour of the free¬
dom of the theatre and the press. He pub¬
lished an open letter addressed to the meet¬

slower pace, his poetic activity. Liszt's sym¬

ters think that they are good he knows
that he is bad. He has no liking for the
bourgeois, any more than has Glapieu he
likes only himself. And here the two real
heroes of the play, the outcast of society and
the outcast of evil, are at one. There was the
same fatal bond between Valjean and
Javert.
In her staging of this duel, Ariette
Téphany decided on an empty stage rather
than a realistic setting, relying on the im¬
agination of the audience and its apprecia¬
tion of the text.
All that is to be seen, centre stage, is a
piano. It is at once a coffin and a music-box,
a safe and a cultural symbol of bourgeois
aspirations. Glapieu will smash this object,
which is both enemy and accomplice, be¬
fore becoming enmeshed in its strings like a
fly in a spider's web.
Pierre Meyrand, who played the part of
Glapieu, interprets the role in the spirit of
Chaplin; but the vagabond he portrays is
not a comic tramp but a hard man who has
learned how to struggle for life, to fight
against hunger. With him the grotesque
becomes bravado, the ridiculous is height¬
ened with emotion. We do not laugh at him,
but with him.
The show, and its leading actor, had a
tremendous reception wherever it was
staged in France, both in Paris and in the
provinces. Audiences consisting both of
ordinary suburbanites and of young people
were particularly enthusiastic. Author,
actors and public came together in a unity 17

^ few playwrights anywhere in the world have
been capable of inspiring. Hugo had been
rediscovered.
In Africa, during an official tour of eight
French-speaking countries, this interaction
achieved an almost miraculous intensity.
We played on two memorable occasions to
audiences of 2,000 students on a basket-ball
field in Dakar and of 3,000 in a concrete
amphitheatre in Kinshasa.
The actors, sweating profusely in their
heavy winter costumes, wondered how a.
performance lasting two and a half hours,
with no scenery, nothing but a piano, a text,
ten arc-lamps and very poor acoustics,
could hold such a vast audience. What
would our African hosts find to interest
them in these stories of money, of a married
woman become a widow, of the Emperor
and of the Restoration? How would they be
able to penetrate the obscurities of Hugo?
No sooner had Glapieu spoken his first
lines than the attention of the audience was
riveted and its sympathy captured. Laugh¬
ter came in short but hearty bursts. There
was none of the inertia of the kind of audi¬
ence that is slow to laugh and then goes on
laughing because it has begun to laugh, so
that neither the action of the play nor the
actors can continue. This was alert, obser¬
vant laughter of an audience that seemed to
anticipate Hugo's humour. They were ex¬
pecting it, they wanted it. The show main¬
tained its pace despite the heat and difficult
technical conditions.
For the audience was there, ready to play
its part, and the actors delighted in working
the miracle of melodrama, that mixture of
drama and emotion. When Glapieu is
alone, in front of the safe, he lights a cigar,
assumes the pose of a person of con¬
sequence, and suddenly the vagabond is
transformed into a business magnate. At
this point the audience burst into thunder¬
ous gales of Homeric laughter. At other
times there were ripples of admiration for
the villain's stratagems (yes, admiration,
for after all it is up to the poor to thwart his
tricks). And then there were anxious sighs
or embarrassed giggles at the transports of
the lovers, Cyprienne and Edgar.
There was, too, a silence full of uneasy
amazement when Etiennette launched into
the monologue in which she makes her con¬
fession with the words: "Dreadful things
happen; women are not always happy."
The actress uttered these words simply, in
matter-of-fact tones, yet with all the feeling
that a woman can put into them. The audi¬
ence could be heard to emit, in unison, a
single groan of pity.
And when, at the final trial, Glapieu
begins to unravel the threads of the plot and
to perform his good deed (and in so doing
sacrifice himself), the audience of three
thousand at Kinshasa held its collective
breath in suspense. My neighbour was
moved to tears. Then, when Glapieu made
his exit to go back to prison, the three
thousand rose to their feet as one with a cry
that we did not understand at first, the cry
"Encore" uttered by three thousand people
smiling through their tears.
All the actors taking part and the few
French people in the audience were under
the spell of the most powerful theatrical
experience of their lives. It was a celebra¬
tion of the French language and the play
had been performed before its very own
audience, the audience it would surely have
had in 1866 had Hugo not locked it away at
that time.
We begin to understand the nature of the
"obsession with an idea" of which Hugo had
spoken. Novels did not give him the oppor¬
tunity to reach the reader directly, not even
novels that became legendary, like Les
Misérables. His relationship with the reader
was always purely conceptual. In the
theatre, and especially in Mille Francs de
Récompense, which is a really a shortened,
dramatized version of Les Misérables,
Hugo would have felt again the touch of
human warmth. He denied himself that
pleasure, returning to exile, as Glapieu re¬
turned to prison, with no illusions.
The illusions are for us, we who are
people of the theatre.
JACQUES TEPHANY, of France, who com-
bines the roles of playwright and script-writer
with those of theatre administrator andproducer,
is also the author of studies on Victor Hugo and,
in particular, on his play Mille Francs de Récom¬
pense. The presentation of Mille Francs de Ré¬
compense which he evokes in this article was
created in 1979-1980 by the Théâtre en Liberté
company, under the direction ofAriette Téphany,
and has been revived in 1985. It was broadcast
on French television in July and has been on tour
in France and in French-speaking Africa under
the aegis of the Association Française d'Action
Artistique.
Ink, Charcoal and Soot
In his Salon de 1859, a critical account of
the major art exhibition of that year, the
poet Charles Baudelaire spoke of "the
magnificent Imagination" revealed In
Hugo's drawings. Hugo wrote to Baude¬
laire that he was "delightedand veryproud
that you should think well of what I like to
call mypen and ink drawings. In fact I have
ended up using pencil, charcoal, sepia,
coal, soot and all kinds ofbizarre mixtures
which happen to bring out more or less
what my eye, or rather my mind's eye,
retains. I find this an amusing pastime
between two stanzas".
As Pierre Georgel, curator of the Musée
des Beaux Arts of Dijon, points out in his
study Histoire d'un Peintre Malgré Lui (An
Artist in Spite of Himself) this was Hugo's
way of stressing that his artistic output
was secondary to what he considered to
be his really important workhis writing.
He did not want the attention of thegeneral
public to be distracted from his books, a
position he maintained to the end of his
life, preferring to show his "scribblings"
only to a close circle of friends and in¬
timates. Nevertheless, in bequeathing to
the Bibliothèque Nationale the hundreds
ofdrawings he hadmade and kept, he was
indicating to posterity the very important
place they filled in the overall schema of
his creative work.
His very considerable artistic output
(some three thousand known items, most
of them produced between 1830 and 1876)
is striking in its depth and variety of in¬
spiration caricatures, sketches made
18 during his travels, realand imaginary land
scapes, inkstains, imprints, cut-outs, the
scrawllngs of automatic writing. From
1848, drawing became more than merely a
secondary activity for Hugo, Indeed, for a
few years It virtually eclipsed his literary
work. His drawings soon gained recog¬
nition; the poet and novelist Théophile
Gautier praised their "prodigious plastic
sensitivity". They may even have had
some Influence on certain engravers and
painters such as Gustave Doré and Rodol¬
phe Bresdin. Van Gogh admired them and
Picasso owned several of them.
The general public only really became
aware of his artistic work in 1888, three
years after his death, when the first exhibi¬
tion ofhis drawings was held in Paris and
when, at the beginning of the century, his
house in the Place des Vosges, Paris, was
opened as a museum. But full recognition
of the scope and modernity of his art had
to await the surrealists of the twentieth
century who were quick to appreciate its
chimeric quality and the "psychic auto¬
matism" which it reveals.
The importance of Hugo the artisthis
imaginative richness and the singularity of
his art whose ramifications have yet to be
precisely definedreceived the just rec¬
ognition ofa number of writers ofboth the
19th and the 20th century; among them
must be counted Paul Claudel, who spoke
of "the panic contemplation" that typifies
these works, and Gaétan Picon, who said,
with Hugo's art in mind, that "drawing Is
the realm of the essential", the domain of
spontaneity.
Today, going beyond the various more
or less partial, partisan approaches to a
disturbing body of art, a number of spe¬
cialists, in particular Pierre Georgel, are
attempting to establish a strict chronology
of Hugo's artistic output in order to study
more closely the relationships between
his literary and his graphic work. These
colour pages give a glimpse of the power
and originality of Hugo the artist, a figure
indissociable from Hugo the poet.

The
showman
poet
by René Char
Below, manuscript of the first two stanzas
of a poem written by Hugo at Jersey on 3
April 1854 and published in 1881 in the
collection Les Quatre Vents de l'Esprit.
"/ am made of shadow and marble.
Like the black feet of the tree
I plunge deep Into the night.
I listen; I am under ground;
From below I say to the thunder:
Wait! make no noise.
I, whom they call the poet,
Am in the speechless night
The mysterious staircase;
I am the Darkness-staircase;
In my gloomy spirals
The shadow opens its dim eyes."
RATHER than a clear step forward in
our understanding of the poetry of
the nineteenth century, Hugo is an
intense and teeming moment of the culture
span of the period. Portly and august of
bearing, his is the success of the extrava¬
gant, or, perhaps, the extravagance of the
successful. Before his giant presence we
gape, we admire, we guffaw with laughter,
we seethe, we rage, or we declare ourselves
partisans of the whole "Hugo show". We
are taken aback by such an outpouring of
cunningly contrived fatuity. On the instant
we are filled with remorse. He is the least
indispensable of the poets of our time; yet
he it is who best succeeds in playing alter¬
nately upon the lost art of verse, when that
art is inspired, the most harmonious and
then the most vibrantly crimson of lights.
He is effortless, mysterious, with the
bounding grace of a tiger. His touch defies
description, at times almost matching
Racine's bewitching caress. He reaches the
heights with the vertiginous speed and ver¬
tical flight of a rocket. Herein lies his share
of greatness.
There are themes for all ages and all
viewpoints, but not one of them is wholly
satisfying for anyone. The flow from his
torrential hand, seen in fragments traced
out like runic spells on crumpled scraps and
sheets, is unequalled. As the genius of the
woods he out-Pans Pan. Taken as a whole
he is impossible a big-talking Barnum,
flaunting his honours, his poesy, his wealth,
wielding his verbal virtuosity in the ordinary
affairs of daily life like a baton, a pass, an
open-sesame. With his eclipse in the violent
death inflicted on him by the rising star of
Baudelaire the Baudelaire bomb literally
blew him to pieces , all his fair fiefs claim
their freedom, his days no longer, rise in
boastful dawn, whole segments of his
poems break away , flying in their splendour
before us. Of his interminable and often
senile discourse with God and Satan there
remain but a few needle-sharp barbs and
some scattered lilies, which yet are almost
unique in their fragrance and flame.
As a writer of prose Hugo cannot com¬
pete with Chateaubriand. He is worlds
apart from Gérard de Nerval who, with his
Sylvie, lent enchantment to age-old groves.
Yet he could convey a picture of things he
had seen far better than could the lens of
Nicéphore Niepce's camera.
Hugo, it must be added, is the archetypal,
grandiose mirror, shaped in the form of a
heart and reflecting his achievement, to

reputations of certain of our great contem¬

RENE CHAR is one of France's leading contem¬

collection of his poems and writings, was pub¬

latest work, Les Voisinages de Van Gogh, was
published earlier this year.

'The voice of justice'
Victor Hugo in China
VICTOR Hugo was one of the first
Western writers to be known and
translated in China.
Chinese readers discovered him at the
beginning of the century thanks to Su Zigu,
a Chinese translator who in 1903 published
the first eleven chapters of Les Misérables
as a serial in a Shanghai daily newspaper.
However inaccurate it may have been, this
translation helped to make Hugo known to
the Chinese and was soon followed by two
more in 1906 and 1907. Keen interest was
aroused in Hugo and more of his works
appeared in Chinese: Bug-Jargal, Le
Dernier Jour d'un Condamné, Notre-Dame
de Paris, Quatrevingt-Treize, Les Travail¬
leurs de la Mer, and Han d'Islande.
Lu Xun (1881-1936), one of China's
greatest writers, translated an extract from
Les Misérables, which he published under
the title of Fantine.
Zeng Pu (1872-1935), famous for his
novel The Flower Emerging from an Ocean
ofSins, was the first Chinese who set out to
produce a Chinese version of Hugo's com¬
plete works. Between 1907 and 1935 he
translated Marie Tudor, Quatrevingt-
Treize, Ruy Blas, Hernani, L'Homme qui
Rit, Cromwell, Marion de Lorme, Le Roi
s'Amuse, Les Jumeaux, Angelo, Tyran de
Padoue, Le Théâtre en Liberté, and Notre-
Dame de Paris, as well as many other prose
texts and three poems.
In the meantime, other works by Hugo
were being translated and published in
Chinese. They included versions of. Pauvres
Gens, by the writer and linguist Liu Ban-
nong (1891-1934); La Conscience, by the
poet Dai Wangshu (1905-1950); and Saison
des Semailles and Le Soir, by the poet Liang
Zongdai.
The height of Victor Hugo's fame in
China came in 1935, the fiftieth anniversary
of his death.
On that occasion, Mao Dun, one of our
greatest modern novelists, published stu¬
dies on Les Misérables and Hernani. Shen
Baoji, a specialist in French culture, also
brought out a study on Les Misérables and
an "Anthology of the Poems of Victor
Hugo". Ma Songrong, who had just paid a
long visit to France, wrote "The French
Novelist Victor Hugo" and "Victor Hugo as
seen by the French Today".
Hugo was also given wide coverage in the
most influential newspapers of the time
such as "Beijing Morning" and "Impar-
24 tiality".
by Li Meiying
In 1952, many noted Chinese personali- I
ties published newspaper articles on the |
occasion of the 150th anniversary of Hugo's I
birth. The poet, playwright and politician I
Guo Moro (1892-1972), then Vice-Presi¬
dent of the permanent committee of the |
People's National Assembly, paid a vibrant |
tribute to Hugo's memory in a work entitled |
"For Peace, Democracy and Progress". I
Mao Dun, then Minister of Culture, wrote I
"Why the Chinese like the Works of Victor I
Hugo", and proposed that the memory of I
Victor Hugo should be honoured at the I
second session of the World Peace Council, |
in Vienna.
At the same time, the Beijing Library I
organized an important exhibition on |
Hugo's life and work, and his works were I
prominently displayed in the bookshops.
New translations appeared of some of his |
major works, notably Quatrevingt-Treize,
L'Homme qui Rit, and Les Misérables.
Biographical studies were also published.
Since 1976, texts by Hugo have been
appearing at an even faster rate: there have
been no less than eight different versions of
Les Misérables! Three anthologies of his
poetry, translated by Wen Jiasi, Jin Zhiping
and Cheng Baoyi, are currently in course of
publication.
In 1981 a nationwide symposium on
Hugo, held at Changsha, the capital of
Hunan province, was attended by hundreds
of teachers and researchers specializing in
French literature. Almost ninety studies
were presented, and some twenty of them
have appeared in a collection entitled Com¬
mentaries on the Literary Works of Victor
Hugo.
Liu Mingjiu is preeminent among Hugo
specialists in China. His work, begun in the
early 1960s, was interrupted by the ten
years of the "Cultural Revolution", but it is
nevertheless considerable. He has trans¬
lated all Hugo's theoretical texts and col¬
lected them in a work entitled "Victor Hugo
Talks of Literature". And in the
monumental "History of French Liter¬
ature", the first two volumes of which have
been published, one of the most important
chapters is that in which Liu Mingjiu discus¬
ses Hugo.
Another leading specialist, Feng Hanjin,
is making a special study of Hugo's art of
versification and the richness of his lan¬
guage.
Hugo's work has influenced a number of
Chinese writers. Reading Les Misérables

1 851 . Besides being increasingly criticized by
the government majority in the Assembly,
Hugo was also going through a serious crisis
in his love life. Juliette Drouet discovered her
lover's relationship with Léonie Biard and the
two women insisted that he choose between
them. His family life was convulsed by the
imprisonment of his sons for having written
newspaper articles on capital punishment and
the right of sanctuary for foreign refugees. On
2 December, Louis Napoleon's coup d'Etat
found Hugo in the front rank of the republican
resistance, but his efforts were powerless
against the might of the army and the passive
attitude of the civilian population. Nine days
later, Hugo went into exile. Established in
Brussels, he lost no time in starting L'Histoire
d'un Crime. Verdi's opera Rigoletto, based on
Hugo's Le Roi s'Amuse, was given its first
performance in Venice.
1852. Writing was to become the only form of
political resistance: "The inkstand versus the
cannon", as Hugo was to put it in a letter to his
wife. His work on L'Histoire d'un Crime prog¬
ressed, substantiated as it was by the increas¬
ing number of testimonies provided by
Frenchmen who had been expelled or had
escaped, and his Napoléon le Petit took
shape within weeks. Having been warned by
the Belgian government that he would be
liable to expulsion if he published a book on
the "Prince-President", Hugo left Brussels in
early August for Jersey, where his family and
Juliette Drouet joined him. Napoléon le Petit
was published in London and put on sale in
Brussels the same day. The Hugo family
moved into Marine Terrace in Jersey and the
exile devoted himself to his poetry. On 29
November, Hugo made a speech in comme¬
moration of the anniversary of the 1830
revolution in Poland, in which he hailed the
Poles as being the "first-born of persecution".

1853. Publication in Belgium of a volume of
Hugo's ruvres Oratoires (collected
speeches). In Jersey, he continued to pourout
satirical poems. The Hugo family was intro¬
duced to "table-turning". Although they were
initially sceptical, they became adepts follow¬
ing a communication which seemed to come
from Léopoldine. Over a two-year period, they
received messages from more than one hun¬
dred "spirits", including Dante, Jesus Christ,
Mozart, Rousseau, Socrates, Shakespeare
and Luther. In November, Les Châtiments
was published in two editions, one complete
and the other expurgated, and the collection
was thereafter smuggled into France.
1854. There was no let-up in the messages
received through the table-turning exercises
or in Hugo's enormous poetic output. In
January, a death sentence passed on the
neighbouring island prompted the exiled poet
to address an appeal to the Inhabitants of
Guernsey, calling them to abolish a punish¬
ment that was out of key with the times. He
started work on a long poem which was even¬
tually to become La Fin de Satan and, on the
anniversary of the 1 848 Revolution, made a
lyrical and Utopian speech, in which he
affirmed that the emergence of the United
States of Europe, and indeed of the Universal
Republic, would mark the end of poverty and

ignorance, and the birth of an educated and
balanced civilization. The Spanish Junta de
Salud (Committee of Public Safety) invited
Hugo to settle in Spain, an offer which he was
very tempted to accept. The anniversary of
the Polish revolution afforded him an oppor- ,
tunity of publishing a pamphlet denouncing
the Crimean War.
1855. Death of Abel Hugo, the poet's eldest
brother. Hugo again wrote a number of bril¬
liant pages on the occasion of the anniversary
of the 1 848 Revolution, as well as a host of
poems, many of which were included in Les
Contemplations. In October, three French ex¬
iles were expelled from Jersey. Hugo sup¬
ported them by issuing a declaration which
was to be signed by thirty-five other exiles,
from France, Germany, Poland, Hungary and
Italy and was, in the days following, to give rise
to an order expelling all exiles. Hugo moved
on to Guernsey and settled with his family in
Saint Peter's Port.
inspired Su Manshu (1884-1918) with the
idea of a new world, an extremely advanced
theme in China at that time.
Lu Xun, who as we have seen translated
an extract from Les Misérables, had a par¬
ticular sympathy for Fantine, the woman
"who was not left to live even in the slums".
He keenly wished that one day such injus¬
tices would be brought to an end.
It has been maintained that Ba Jin, at the
outset of his career, was fundamentally in¬
fluenced by Emile Zola. But essentially he
preferred Hugo. In his essay Ba Jin talks of
Literature, he says: "People think that
Maupassant and Zola are the most widely
read and best known French writers in
China. But personally I should mention, in
addition to them, Victor Hugo and Jean-
Jacques Rousseau." And Ba Jin recognized
that Les Misérables had had a profound
impact on his life.
But in China Hugo's popularity goes far
beyond a circle of initiates. He is known,
understood, and loved by a large part of the
population. When the French film Notre-
Dame de Paris was shown at the end of the
1970s, there were endless queues outside
the cinemas and a televised version of Marie
Tudor in 1983 was enthusiastically received.
We like Hugo the revolutionary of litera¬
ture whose Cromwell in 1827 was a triumph
for the Romantic school and restored liber¬
ty to the imagination and to the subject.
We like Hugo the noble fighter, the
valiant defender of justice. To fight the
tyrant and defend the Republic, he pub¬
lished Napoléon le Petit, Histoire d'un
Crime, and Châtiments. In 1859, he con¬
temptuously refused the amnesty offered by
Napoleon III with the declaration: "When
liberty returns, so shall I." He would only
set foot in Paris again after nineteen years of
exile when the Second Empire fell and the
Republic was proclaimed.
His loftiness of spirit reminds us of Qu
Yuan (340-278 BC), the first great Chinese
poet, who died fighting a corrupt and reac¬
tionary nobility.
The voice of Victor Hugo spoke out
whenever there was oppression in the
world. It should not be forgotten that for
over a century China was a prey to foreign
oppression, a country raped and plundered
without being able to put up an effective
resistance. Thus Yuanmingyuan (the Sum¬
mer Palace), a marvel of architecture, was
sacked and burned by the expeditionary
forces of England and France! In those dark 25

days when the Chinese people seemed to
have been abandoned by everyone, from a
little island in far-off Europe, from the
home of an exile, rose a voice vibrant with
justice, to condemn this act of banditism. It
was the voice of Victor Hugo (See page 14).
Yes, for us Chinese, the voice of Victor
Hugo is the voice of justice. Always on the
side of the weak, on the side of those who
claimed the right to live, Hugo's magnanim¬
ity went so far that he opened his door to the
outlaws of the Paris Commune. Several
times in the French Senate he called for a
"total, generous amnesty, without reserva¬
tion, without conditions and without res¬
trictions" for the Communards, unafraid of
the jeers of reactionary forces athirst for
vengeance.
Finally, Hugo is loved in China because
of the democratic and humanist ideals
which imbue his titanic work. His finest,
most powerful, purest pages describe the
humble, the wretched, the outcasts, all
those who possess true nobility of soul.
Quasimodo, the bell-ringer of Notre-
Dame, is monstrously ugly, but his soul is
pure and he is good. Esmeralda the gypsy is
generous, sensitive, and great-hearted. The
convict Jean Valjean, who languished in
gaol for stealing bread to feed his starving
nephews, displays dauntless courage. He is
the symbol of humanity's hope for a juster
world. And since he appeared on television,
Gavroche, the irrepressible, mischievous
Parisian youngster, has become a legendary
image of adolescence in China.
Finally, this ardent humanist detested
war and was a champion of peace. This is
yet another reason why he is so popular
with the Chinese people.
Today on the hundredth anniversary of
his death, the Chinese people wishes to join
the French people and all the peoples of the
world in paying him an admiring and grate¬
ful tribute.
Victor Hugo will always live among us, in
our hearts.
LI MEIYING, of China, is professor of French at
the University of Beijing, where she herself was
once a pupil before completing her studies at the
University of Rennes, France. She has trans¬
lated several works of famous Chinese writers
into French, including La Maison de Thé (The
Teahouse), by Lao She, and three works by Ba
Jin, La Pluie (The Rain), La Brume (The Mist)
and L'Automne (Autumn).
Life and Times of V. H.
1856. Hugo wrote extensive fragments of
Dieu (God). The collection Les Contempla¬
tions was published in April and was such a
success that Hugo decided to protect himself
from further expulsion by becoming a property
owner for the first time in his life, when he
bought a house at 38 Hauteville Street. The
decoration of the house, which was complete¬
ly designed and supervised by Hugo himself,
would take years to complete, but the family
was able to move into it in autumn. The exile
launched two further appeals by way of en¬
couragement to embryo nations: these were
A l'Italie and A la Grèce.
1857. Hugo devoted himself completely to
poetry. Among other things, he wrote several
"minor epics", which were subsequently
brought together in La Légende des Siècles,
La Révolution and a good part of La Pitié
Suprême.
1 858. In the hope of finding a husband for her
daughter Adèle, Hugo's wife took her to Paris
for several months, and from then onwards
she was never again to live at Hauteville
House on a permanent basis. The poet com¬
pleted La Pitié Suprême, Le Verso de la Page
and L'Ane. His work on the "minor epics" was
interrupted at the end of June by a carbuncle
on his back, and he was only able to start
working again in early October.

The JeanValjean
of writers
THERE are writers without whom the
history of literature is inconceivable.
There are those without whom his¬
tory itself is inconceivable. Victor Hugo is
among their number.
In his novel Les Misérables, there is a
significant episode in which Jean Valjean, a
former convict known for his prodigious
strength, who has carefully concealed his
criminal past and made a new life for him¬
self as a "respectable, honest man", witnes¬
ses an accident in which a man is trapped
under a cart. With a superhuman effort
Jean Valjean lifts the cart to release the
victim knowing that in doing so he will
betray his true identity. If my memory from
childhood days, when I read the novel,
serves me correctly, it is at this moment that
by Yevgeny Yevtushenko
Police Inspector Javert, who for years has
been on the track of Valjean, knows that at
last he has found his man.
There are similarities between Victor
Hugo himself and the hero of his novel. On
more than one occasion he had the oppor¬
tunity of resting comfortably on his laurels,
and at such times he skilfully concealed his
rebellious nature under a veneer of conven¬
tional literary respectability. But the sight
of his fellow-men being oppressed, rather
than arousing in him the instinct of self-
preservation, evoked a noble attitude of
protectiveness towards them. As stubborn
an inquisitor as Javert, Hugo was a scrupu¬
lous, methodical, high-principled profes¬
sional who did not shrink from plunging
into the underworld of Paris in pursuit of an
Frontispiece drawn by Hugo for his collec¬
tion of poems La Légende des Siècles.
1859. Hugo went on a two-week visit to the
island of Sark with his eldest son and Juliette
Drouet, this being the first time that the two
had met. In August, he replied to the amnesty
decree by issuing a Declaration which he
arranged to be printed in the English press
and in which he stated: "When freedom re¬
turns, so shall I". However, most of the
political exiles living in Guernsey returned to
France. The first part of La Légende des
Siècles: Histoire - Les Petites Epopées (His¬
tory the Minor Epics) was published in Sep¬
tember. Hugo forsook the epic style to write
several poems which were included in the
collection Les Chansons des Rues et des
Bois, but then returned to it by taking up La Fin
de Satan, which he had abandoned five years
earlier. He made a public appeal to the United
States of America in a bid to save the life of the
abolitionist John Brown, who had been sent¬
enced to death.
1860. Hugo wrote to Le Progrès, the news¬
paper of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince,
conveying his hopes for the brotherhood of
man, stating: "On earth, there are neither
blacks nor whites. There are only minds." He
continued to work on La Fin de Satan until
April, when he returned to Les Misérables, a
work which he had discarded twelve years
before. In June, he returned in triumph to
Jersey at the invitation of the Committee set
up to support Garibaldi and delivered a
speech on freedom and the liberation of Italy.
His friend Ribeyrolles, a former parliamenta¬
rian and an exile, died in Rio de Janeiro, and
Hugo sent the Brazilian Committee an epitaph
in verse for his tomb.
objective. Yet, at the same time, he was
always on the side of the hunted, not the
hunter. His was a dual, indeed a many-sided
nature, capable of encompassing the char¬
acters not only of an Esmeralda or a Quasi¬
modo, but of all the curious, teeming fauna
ofNotre-Dame de Paris. Like Jean Valjean,
Hugo could not prevent himself from strug¬
gling to "lift the cart" even if this might
mean being crushed under its weight him¬
self.
In so doing he assumed the burden of
history.
Hugo has been accused of being melod¬
ramatic and grandiloquent, and there is
some truth in this accusation. But we can
forgive every excess in return for scenes
such as that in which the street-urchin Gav¬
roche falls asleep in the belly of a statue of
an elephant. For Hugo was Gavroche as
well, drowsing from time to time in the
impressive but hollow belly of his fame,
knowing, like Gavroche, that his refuge was
being nibbled away by mice, yet ready at the
first sound of gunfire to leap down and take
his place at the barricades. To the end of his
days Hugo remained something of a Gav¬
roche, a Paris street-urchin.
When, in his poem Le Procès à la Révolu¬
tion (The Revolution on Trial), taken from
his book L'Année Terrible, he wrote, "O
juges, vous jugez les crimes de l'aurore
(Judges, you charge the very dawn with
crimes), he was defending not only the Re¬
volution but also himself. And in another
poem, Ecrit sur un exemplaire de la Divina
Commedia (Words written on a copy of The
Divine Comedy), he wrote:
Puis jefus un lion rêvant dans les déserts
Parlant à la nuit sombre avec sa voix
grondante.
Maintenant, je suis homme, et je
m'appelle Dante.
(Then I was a lion dreaming in the
wilderness
To the dark night growling my com¬
plaint.
Now I am a man, and my name
is Dante.)
Hugo was, indeed, the Dante of the French
Revolution. Not only did the poet in him
evoke the romance of the barricades, he
also waded, like Jean Valjean, through the
bloody, underground sewers of this historic
event.
Yes, like the hard-bitten convict who
bought a doll for the child Cosette, Hugo
was "sentimental". Yet those who con¬
demn others for their sentimentality are
usually themselves incomplete beings who
lack this great human quality and secretly
envy those who possess it. A man who is not
sentimental is not truly a man. It is better to
be quick to tears than to be incapable of
them.
The British essayist and historian Tho¬
mas Carlyle is said to have remarked that,
like Samson , great men carry on their shoul¬
ders the prison doors behind which people
. wish to enclose them. Hugo was such a man.
The snobbish, condescending verdict that
dismisses him as no more than a writer for
teenagers is, in fact, a compliment. For it is
during the years of adolescence that our
psychology takes shape and, it must be
admitted, that we absorb all that is best in 27

Life and Times of V. H.
1861. Hugo grew a beard. In Paris, his
brother-in-law Paul Chenay published the en¬
graving "John Brown", which was produced
from Hugo's drawing of a hanged man. At the
end of March, the writer left Guernsey in the
company of Charles and Juliette for a three-
month journey on the continent, firstly to
Belgium, where he visited his wife and daugh¬
ter in Brussels, stayed in the vicinity of the
battlefield of Waterloo and completed Les
Misérables. He then went on to Holland.
Charles decided to settle on the continent.
Hugo wrote three important open letters: one
to the Congress of the Antwerp Artistic, Liter¬
ary and Scientific Circle on literary and artistic
property, another to the Assoziazione Unitaria
Italiana to thank it for having spontaneously
made him a member and to encourage it in its
work, and the third to Captain Butler, on the
sack of the Summer Palace in Beijing. He also
ordered a glassed-in room to be built at the top
of his house, for use as a study. This was to be
his "look-out".
1 862. Hugo wrote a letter to the Belgian news¬
papers on the prisoners condemned to death
in Charleroi, and this was instrumental in hav¬
ing seven death sentences commuted. He
organized a weekly meal in his home for the
poor children of the island. The publication of
Les Misérables started in Brussels on 30
March and in Paris on 3 April, but the perform¬
ance of a drama based on the novel by
Charles Hugo and Paul Meurice was banned
by the French government. In August and
September, Hugo travelled with Juliette in
Belgium and along the Rhine. Journalists
from many countries who were admirers of
Les Misérables organized a banquet in his
honour in Brussels, at which he took the floor
to hail the free press and the contribution it
had made to social progress. Since he was
about to return to Guernsey, Hugo had to
decline an invitation to speak at the Interna¬
tional Congress for the Advancement of the
Social Sciences, but he sent it a letter
announcing his membership which was pub¬
lished by the Brussels newspaper Le Temps
and in which he stated: "There is nothing
more pressing and urgent than free and com¬
pulsory education". He was also successful in
his appeal to the people of Geneva to reject a
draft Constitution upholding the death penal¬
ty. An Album of twelve drawings by Hugo,
engraved by Paul Chenay, with a preface by
Théophile Gautier and a portrait and foreword
by Hugo himself, was published in Paris.

us. Later we form a shell and lose our
receptivity.
There are many outstanding writers who
do not awaken in me a sense of my own
humanity. This is by no means the case with
Hugo. In his poetic masterpiece Oblako v
shtanakh (A Cloud in trousers), Vladimir
Mayakovsky speaks of "the chimeras that
haunt Notre-Dame de Paris". At the time
when he wrote the poem, Mayakovsky had
not visited Paris and his vision of the cathe¬
dral was clearly drawn from Victor Hugo.
Great art always fathers offspring, and
Mayakovsky was one of Hugo's "children".
He, too, was a child of the revolution; he,
too, like Jean Valjean, felt the invisible
shackles of duty around his ankles.
In the last photographs taken of him,
Dostoyevsky's face bears the sombre ex¬
pression of a convict, a Jean Valjean. It is
no coincidence that the titles of Hugo's Les
Misérables and of Dostoyevsky's The In¬
sulted and Injured are so similar.
Someone once called the literary profes¬
sion a "sweet servitude". This may seem a
strange description, but it is an accurate
one. Hugo bore that servitude with honour.

1863. At the beginning of the year, Russia
crushed a popular uprising in Poland. Hugo
responded to the appeal of the Polish news¬
paper Kolokolby writing an address A l'Armée
Russe (to the Russian army), which was re¬
produced in the press throughout Europe. In
Puebla, the Mexican city besieged by French
troops, a bilingual newspaper published daily
"banner" headlines consisting of extracts
from Napoléon le Petit, and taunted the invad¬
ers with the slogan "You have Napoleon but
we have Victor Hugo". Hugo responded by
writing a stirring essay on The Mexican War.
His daughter Adèle fled from the family home
and set off for Canada. Hugo's wife published
Victor Hugo Raconté par un Témoin de sa Vie
(Victor Hugo's Life Recounted by an Eye¬
witness) and came back to Guernsey for ten
days. In the summer, Hugo and Juliette went
on a seven-week trip to Germany. The writer
started to work on a essay on Shakespeare
and wrote Promontorium Somnii.
1864. Publication of William Shakespeare,
the crowning genius of all time. Hugo was
invited to officiate at a ceremony in Paris
commemorating the three-hundredth
anniversary of Shakespeare's birth, and it
was agreed that he would be represented by
an empty chair. The Imperial government
banned the event. Hugo wrote a Preface for
the new translation of Shakespeare by Fran¬

Victor Hugo in the Soviet Union
The works of Victor Hugo are highly popular in the Soviet
Union, not least because they form part of the compulsory
school syllabus. Every pupil knows the poems beginning "Sur
une barricade, au milieu..." (L'Année Terrible, 1872) and
"Demain dès l'aube..." (Les Contemplations, 1856), and is
acquainted with the episodes featuring Cosette and Gavroche in
Les Misérables (1862).
Translated into Russian as early as 1862, Les Misérables is the
most widely read of Hugo's novels and has often been re¬
printed. Many abridged versions and adaptations have been
published, especially since the beginning of the Soviet era, most
of them between 30 and 50 pages long and intended for use in
schools. The stories of Cosette and Gavroche figure largely in
these publications, especially in non-Russian languages. Les
Misérables has also been illustrated by famous artists such as
D.I. Mitrokhin (1923) and Naum Altman (1949).
The other highly popular novels are Notre-Dame de Paris,
Les Travailleurs de la Mer (translated in 1866, the year it
appeared) and L'Homme qui Rit (translated in 1869, the year in
which it was published in French). The most famous translation
of the latter is by the poet Benedikt Livtchitz.
A number of great poets have translated Hugo's poems. They
include Fedor I. Tiutchev (1803-1873; an extract from Hugo's
1829 verse drama Hernani), and Valeri Briussov (1873-1924;
"Ce siècle avait deux ans!..." from Les Feuilles d'Automne,
1831, and other poems). "La Grand-Mère" (1829) was trans¬
lated by Aleksandr A. Blok (1880-1921), and Anna Akhmatova
(1889-1966) produced a version of "A Léopoldine" (Les Rayons
et les Ombres, 1840). "Mugitusque Boum" (Les Contem¬
plations, 1856) and a large number of other poems were transla¬
ted by Benedikt Livtchitz. V.A. Rojdestvenski and P.G. Anto-
kolski are two other distinguished translators of Hugo's poetry.
Music has contributed greatly to the popularization of Hugo's
work in the Soviet Union. In 1847, Aleksandr S. Dargomizhsky
(1813-1869) created Esmeralda, an opera which took its title
from the name of the gypsy girl in Les Misérables, and César
Cui's opera Angelo (1876) is based on a prose drama by Hugo.
Cui (1835-1918), a member of the group of Russian composers
known as "the five", also set some of Hugo's poems to music,
notably Vieille Chanson ("Je ne songeais pas à Rose", in Les
Contemplations). Among the many other Russian musicians
who were inspired by Hugo was Serguei V. Rachmaninov
(1873-1943), notably in his song La Réponse ("Autre guitare",
Les Rayons et les Ombres). g

A living presence
in Brazil
IN Brazil, the influence of Victor Hugo
was an all-pervading force throughout
the nineteenth century. His works
attracted the attention of more than a hun¬
dred translators, and in the north-eastern
province of Maranhao alone, over ten
thousand copies of Les Misérables were
sold. In his book Victor Hugo in Brazil,
Carneiro Leao states that the works of the
French poet became known as early as
1841, through the very first Portuguese
translation of the poem Madame autour de
vous, from the Feuilles d'Automne.
Most Brazilian writers were influenced
by Hugoi whom they regarded as the cham¬
pion of freedom of expression and perma¬
nent renewal and the architect of social
justice. But his most illustrious disciple was
undoubtedly the young, romantic poet from
Bahia, Antonio de Castro Alves (1847-
1871), whose short life was rich in adven¬
ture and creative achievement.
His romantic temperament had its roots
in childhood. His grandfather, José Anto¬
nio da Silva Castro, was a legendary figure
in the Bahia region, having led the Maria
Quiteña battalion in the struggle for inde¬
pendence. Later, his uncle became a fer¬
vent actor in the great liberation campaigns.
His mulatto nurse, Leopoldina, who had
recounted to him the sufferings of the en¬
slaved Blacks, was the source of inspiration
for his major work The Slaves. Finally, his
teacher, Abilio César Borges, sensing his
talent, taught him English and French, thus
giving him the opportunity to discover the
great European poets such as Byron and
Hugo.
Of course, Castro Alves was subject to a
variety of influences, particularly as far as
his poetry was concerned, but none of them
was so profound as that of Hugo on the
sensitive young poet. Very early on he iden¬
tified with Hugo, translating many of the
latter's longer poems, such as Chant de
Bug-Jargal, and dedicating many of his
works to him.
The main principles of romantic drama as
defined by Hugo are to be found in Castro
Alves' dramatic works, especially in Gon-
zaga, or the Revolution at Minas, a prose
drama inspired by the independence cam¬
paigns supported by poets in the eighteenth
century. This play, now of purely historical
interest, was a decisive landmark in the
history of the Brazilian theatre. If we recall
that prior to it there was no solid theatrical
30 tradition in Brazil, we can recognize the
by José de Souza Rodrigues
importance of Hugo's contribution in a do¬
main which continued to grow and flourish
from the nineteenth century onwards. Once
more Hugo brought rejuvenation and re¬
newal.
This innovatory force also influenced
Brazilian poetry, to which Hugo made a
decisive contribution with regard to form.
His style, full of imaginative daring, unex¬
pected metaphors and visual evocations,
and the verbal magnetism of a poetry of
cosmic range, which upset all the classical
norms , are at the root of a trend in literature
whose most outstanding representative
Castro Alves was. The historian Capistrano
de Abreu called it "condorism", after the
condor, the great South American bird that
can soar to the highest peaks of the Andes.
The "condorism" of Castro Alves takes
shape in his great poetic fresco The Slaves, a
fierce diatribe against the enslavement of
the Blacks in Brazil. The Slave Ship, one of
the poems from this lengthy, passionately
committed work, was enthusiastically ap¬
plauded when the author recited it at the
Literary Lyceum on 7 September 1868.
Hugo's influence is clearly present in its
atmosphere of unbridled imagination,
powerful idealization and plastic grandeur.
Thanks to the active engagement of the
young romantic poet from Bahia, there was
an upsurge of support for the abolitionist
cause.
A Dantean vision... on the deck
Bodies lie red under the lanterns.
Bloodstained light...
The crack of the whip and the clanking of
chains. . .
A mass of bodies black as the night
Seethe in a macabre dance. . .
Raising the starving mouth to her
nipple,
The mother feeds the black child
With the blood of her poor veins.
Naked frightened girls,
Borne along by the monstrous crowd,
Bewail in vain their sorrows.
Like Hugo, the defender of the poverty-
stricken and the unfortunate, Castro Alves
became the spokesman of the revolutionary
ideas of his generation. In his poem The
Century, following in the footsteps of his
French mentor, he evoked the great causes
that engrossed the thinkers of his time
(Victor Hugo's exile was one of these),
directly echoing the universal humanism of
the poet of Guernsey.
Life and Times of V. H.
1865. Death of Emily de Putron, Francois-
Victor's fiancée. François-Victor left Guern¬
sey and his father delivered the funeral
oration. Hugo made several declarations
on capital punishment and agreed to be a
member of a Committee established for the
purpose of erecting a statue to Beccaria in
Italy. He wrote a letter to the Gonfaloniere of
Florence to commemorate the six-hun¬
dredth anniversary of Dante. In June, he
wrote La Grand-Mère, a one act comedy,
and then left with Juliette for four months on
the continent. He wrote a letter to the
Students' Congress of Liège, in which he
stated that the brotherhood of education
was the precursor of the brotherhood of
peoples. The Chansons des Rues et des
Bois was published in both Brussels and
Paris. He completed Les Travailleurs de la
Mer. Charles Hugo married Alice Lehaene.
1866. Publication of Les Travailleurs de la
Mer. The novel was dedicated to Guernsey,
"my present retreat and my likely grave".
Hugo wrote a drama entitled Mille Francs de
Récompense (One thousand francs reward)
and a one-act comedy, L'Intervention.. In
Brussels, where he lived for two months in the
summer and met his wife and sons again,
Hugo started work on a new novel L'Homme
qui Rit (The Laughing Man) and on the intro¬
duction to Paris-Guide, a collection of essays
intended for publication on the occasion of the
Universal Exhibition. Published an open
letter in response to the appeal launched by
the inhabitants of Crete, who had risen up
against the Turks. He also became an
honorary member of the Central Committee
for the Polish Cause.
1867. He issued a further letter to the people
of Crete, as well as a letter to England on the
Irish independence movement. He also wrote
a two-act comedy Mangeront-ils? (Will they
eat?) and published his essay on Paris, in
which he extolled Its history and conjured up a
majestic vision of its future whereby, in the
twentieth century, it would become the capital
of a united Europe and, in the centuries there¬
after, the capital of united mankind. He
addressed an appeal to Benito Juarez, Presi¬
dent of the Mexican Republic, asking him to
spare the life of the Emperor Maximilian "by
the grace of the Republic". He had a moving
exchange of letters with a Portuguese corres¬
pondent on the occasion of the abolition of the
death penalty in Portugal. Their correspond¬
ence was published in Le Courrier de
/Europe. He addressed a letter to the Con-

Geneva. He spent three months on the con¬
tinent, firstly with his family in Brussels, where
he saw his first grandson Georges, and then in
Zeeland. Publication in booklet form of La
Voix de Guernesey, a set of verses addressed
to Garibaldi on the occasion of his defeat at
Mentana. He likewise addressed a letter Aux
Membres de la République de Puerto Rico, in
which he proclaimed: "The freedom of the
world is composed of the freedom of its indi¬
vidual peoples".
1 868. Hugo addressed a letter to the Interna¬
tional League of Peace and Freedom, which
was published in the Washington newspaper
Public Opinion, as well as a letter to the Vene¬
tian patriots on Manin, whose ashes were
about to be transferred from London to
Venice. Death of Georges Hugo. Hugo spent
two months in Brussels. Birth of his second
grandson, also named Georges. Death of
Hugo's wife. Hugo accompanied the funeral
cortège as far as the French border. He com¬

letters to Spain, following the fall of that coun¬
try's monarchy.
1869. Hugo wrote L'Epée, Les Deux
Trouvailles de Gallus and Torquemada for a
future collection of Théâtre en Liberté. He
launched an Appel à L'Amérique calling on it

This mimesis becomes more understand¬
able when it is recalled that, from the end of
the eighteenth to the beginning of the
nineteenth century, Brazil, especially in the
political and legal fields, was experiencing
the growing pains of a young society. There
was intense, countrywide awareness of
questions of national importance, such as
the fight for independence, the emancipa¬
tion of slaves, the war with Paraguay, the
sovereignty of the people and the equality
of nations.
Most young people saw in Hugo the
elected representative of the people, the
Deputy of Paris a guide and a prophet, the
defender of freedom and the apostle of
justice. His speeches in the National
Assembly and his humanist discourses
aroused enormous interest.
Victor Hugo's name is for ever associated
with the fight that has been waged in Brazil
since the last century for the emancipation
of man and for equal rights. His is still a
living presence there.

Life and Times of V. H.
1870. Hugo responded to the appeals made
to him from across the Atlantic by delivering
an address Pour Cuba and a letter To the
Women ofCuba who had taken refuge in New
York. He continued his poetic activity and
planned the organization of the collection Les
Quatre Vents de l'Esprit. In June, his son
Charles and family came to stay at Hauteville
House. In view of the impending fall of the
Empire, Hugo left Guernsey with Juliette on
15 August and went to Brussels, where he
impatiently awaited the news from Paris. The
Republic was proclaimed on 4 September
and, on the 5th, Hugo returned to France after
almost nineteen years of exile. No sooner had
he returned than he turned his attack on the
foreign enemy. He addressed a letter Aux
Allemands (To the Germans), followed by
Victor Hugo and the Young Republic, a
lithograph dating from 1893 by the French
artist Adolphe Léon Willette (1857-1926).

letters to the French people and to the Pari¬
sians. Publication of the first French edition of
Les Châtiments, from which public readings
were given in aid of the defence of Paris.
Other public readings were given in aid of war
victims. L'Année Terrible began to take shape
in the light of these events.
1 871 . The French and the Germans signed an
armistice in January and legislative elections
were held in February. Hugo was elected to
the National Assembly and set off at once for
Bordeaux, where it was in session. Three
weeks later, when he spoke in a debate on the
validation of Garibaldi's election, he was so
violently heckled that he resigned. His son
Charles' sudden death compelled him to re¬
turn to Paris on the very day that the uprising
of the Commune broke out. He went on to
Brussels to arrange his son's affairs. His hor¬
ror at the harsh repression of which the "Com¬
munards" were victims prompted him to offer
sanctuary to all the exiles of the Commune.
On account of the stand he took, he was
attacked in his home in the night and was
expelled from Belgian territory. He and his
entourage sought refuge in Luxembourg, after
which he settled in Vianden. The poems com-

"... This man who is more than a prince, since he is an intellect."
Thus, in a letter of 1877, Victor Hugo described Pedro II, the
second and last emperor of Brazil, who was a friend and ardent
admirer of his work.
A cultured man and a thinker formed by the French intellec¬
tual tradition, Dom Pedro de Alcantara (1825-1891) ruled
Brazil for almost half a century (1840-1889) during which the
country experienced considerable social and economic pro¬
gress, notably the abolition of slavery in 1888.
Pedro II considered Hugo, whom he began to read at a very
early age, to be the greatest living French writer, and Hugo had
a high regard for both the intellectual personality and the
political liberalism of this enlightened monarch, during whose
reign Brazil was a haven for a large number of French exiles.
On the death of one of these exiles, Charles Ribeyrolles,
Hugo sent his friends in Brazil a message from Guernsey in
which he wrote: "You are men of noble sentiments and a
generous nation. You have the twofold advantage of a virgin
land and an ancient race..."
Pedro II often visited Paris. On 22 May 1877, ten days after
the publication of L'Art d'Etre Grand-père, a collection of
poems partly inspired by his affection for his two grand-chil¬
dren, Georges and Jeanne, Hugo was visited by the emperor.
His account of the meeting appears in Choses Vues, a collection
of prose writings published posthumously. Here is an extract:
" Talking of kings and emperors, he speaks of: my col¬
leagues.- At one point he said: my rights.... He corrected
himself. / have no rights, I only have power as a result ofchance.
I must use it for good. Progress and liberty!
"When Jeanne entered, he said to me: / have an ambition.
Please introduce me to Mile Jeanne.
"I said to Jeanne: Jeanne, I introduce you to the emperor of
Brazil.
"Jeanne simply said under her breath: He is not wearing a
suit. The emperor said to her: Kiss me, mademoiselle. She
offered her cheek. He continued: But Jeanne, throw your arms
around my neck.
"(...) He talked to me with such gravity and intelligence that
when we parted, I said to him: Sir, you are a great citizen.
"Another detail. When I introduced Georges to him, I said:
Sir, I present my grandson to your majesty. He said to Georges:
My child, there is only one majesty here, and that is Victor
Hugo." U

prising L'Année Terrible continued to increase
in number. At the end of September, on learn¬

Hugo rushed back to Paris to plead in his
favour and in that of other Communards.

people of Rome sent an address to the people
of France, through the person of Victor Hugo
who, in turn, drafted a Réponse aux Romains
(Reply to the Romans). He also sent letters to
the Chairman of the Society of Non-denomi¬
national Schools and to the Chief Editor of
Avenir des Femmes (The Future of Women),
in order to encourage them in their work. He

At home with Hugo
by Rubén Darío
I recently paid a visit to the Victor Hugo
museum, wondering whether I should
find any of the faithful at the shrine.
The museum is located in the house in the
Place des Vosges, Paris, in which the great
man used to live. It is well known that the
museum was assembled thanks chiefly to
the unswerving esteem, love and admira¬
tion of Victor Hugo's friend and disciple
Paul Meurice, who tackled this labour of
love with wholehearted enthusiasm. His
painstaking attention to detail was pushed
to such lengths as to arouse criticism in
certain quarters for such exhibits as "a mo¬
lar that Victor Hugo had extracted on such
and such a date". For my part, I have never
seen this famous molar.
In the entrance hall there is a bust of the
great poet. The staircase is lined with pic¬
tures depicting scenes from his plays, poems
and novels as well as from his life. Farther
on are many illustrations by Rochegrosse,
Boulanger, J. P. Laurens, and others, and
then photographs, caricatures and all the
pictorial Hugoliana, ranging from the ear¬
liest days, from childhood to death-bed, to^
Retouched inkstain on folded paper by
Victor Hugo, dating from around 1850. The
symmetrical inkstain obtained by folding

retouched by the pen. In the centre is the
bust of a figure and, above, two adjoining
profile heads. Hugo practiced this "ink¬
stain art" before he went into exile and
continued to do so until the end of his life. 33

the fine head photographed by Nadar and
painted by Bonnat under the lights of the
mortuary. There are show-cases with the
usual exhibits; academic robes, the robes of
a nobleman of France, a cap, a fine walking-
stick in a case on which can be seen the
inscription Benito Juárez à l'illustre Victor
Hugo.
There are medals and quills, and letters
addressed to the poet bearing the signatures
of famous personalities. There is a morsel
of siege-bread, and, in a box, four large
locks of hair which cover, as it were, the
spectrum of his life.
The fair hair of his days at the "College of
the Nobles", in Madrid; the tresses of the
"golden boy" of Paris; the darker locks of
the author of Hernani, of the young and
brilliant pioneer of Romanticism; the grey
hairs of the fighter, of the stormy outbursts
of the Chamber of Deputies and of political
agitation; the grey-head of L'Année
Terrible and of Les Châtiments; the silver
locks of Guernsey and of L'Art d'Etre
Grand-père; the venerated, white hairs of
the ancient, of the high priest of the lyric
world, of the revered patriarch of thinkers,
whose death shook the world and over
whose mortal remains all Paris stood vigil in
that most grandiose of all catafalques the
Arc de Triomphe.
On a small table stand four ink-wells and
four quills those of Lamartine, of Dumas
senior, of George Sand and of the master of
the house himself. Hugo delighted in mak¬
ing strange objects with his own hands and
used to construct "Chinese" and
"Japanese" artefacts well before the Gon-
court brothers launched the oriental
fashion. The museum contains a mantel¬
piece decorated by Hugo in the oriental
style as well as several panels skilfully col¬
oured and gilded by him in picturesque
style.
There are whimsical mandarins, Chinese
scenes, fantastic animals, outrageous dra¬
gons, comic characters from the Celestial
Empire, rare flowers, gaming boards deco¬
rated with lines and patterns, some multi¬
coloured and apparently in poker-work,
most of them of much interest and inven¬
tiveness. There are paintings and portraits,
and more paintings and more portraits. But
what, above all, attracts the eye and de¬
mands attention is the pictorial work of
Hugo.
The day that an artist-thinker writes a
book that brings out the true value of the
graphic creativity of the finest French poet
we shall have a profoundly important addi¬
tion to our libraries.
For it is in his drawings, in Victor Hugo
the painter, that the extraordinary per¬
sonality of the great and prophetic poet
finds completion. Only in Turner, in Blake

occupies what was formerly the grand
salon of the house In the Place des

1832 to 1848. In 1903, as a result of efforts
by Hugo's close friend, the poet Paul
Meurice (1820-1905), the house became a

work.
found the wealth of fantasy and mystery, of
eternal and transcendent "Romanticism"
with which Hugo's drawings are imbued.
Ruins, fantastic palaces, splendid eastern
buildings straight from the pages of The
Thousand and One Nights, curious con¬
structions like symbolic pyramids, baleful
skies, unreal moonlight, night terrors,
twisted shadows and bright bursts of light,
magical architectures, resurrections of the
past and foretastes of the future, the world
of fantasy, nightmares, horror, the grotes¬
que, the arabesque, the hidden face of art,
all are to be found in the pictorial work of
the great man. So vast is the cathedral-like
façade of his literary work that we fail to
notice the volutes and whorls it was his
delight to conjure from his pen in leisure

moments. To obtain his strange effects he
used as ink anything that came within reach
of his capable acquisitive hand charcoal,
coffee, milky coffee, soot from a burnt
wick.
Farther on can be seen the bed in which
he died, two portraits of his grandchildren
on the nearby mantelpiece, and the desk at
which, an early-riser, he used to work each
morning standing up. One senses an aura of
greatness.
There are not many visitors one or two
foreigners; a father telling his son in a low
voice about the various objects and
documents, a few workmen, for it is a Sun¬
day, and two artists, Germans by the look of
them, making sketches in the room with the
drawings. '
Coming out of the bedroom, I saw on a
table, under a sheet of glass, a paper on
which the poet affirmed his adhesion to a
political party that had yet to come into
being, but which, he asserted, would be
formed in the twentieth century, a party
which would give birth first to the United
States of Europe and then to the United
States of the World. This notion is more
fully developed in lengthy paragraphs in a
number of his works, especially in his writ¬
ings on Paris. It should not be forgotten
that, rather than "The Thinker", Hugo was
"The Great Dreamer".
RUBEN DARIO is the pseudonym of the Nicara-
guan poet, journalist and diplomat Félix Rubén
GarcíaSarmiento(1867-1916).Theleaderofthe
"modernist" movement in Latin American liter¬
ature, he is considered one of the leading writers
in the Spanish language. His works include Azul
(Blue, 1888) and Cantos de Vida y Esperanza
(Songs of Life and Hope, 1905). He travelled
widely, sending back a series of brilliant articles
to the Buenos Aires newspaper La Nación. A
collection ofhis'articles was published in 1906 in
a book entitled Opiniones, from which this text is
taken. He lived in Paris almost uninterruptedly
from 1900to 1914 and was greatly influenced by
Victor Hugo.

An immense crowd kept vigil over the
catafalque erected at the Arc de Triomphe
for the poet's state funeral on 1 June 1885.
Delegations from manycountries followed
his coffin which, in accordance with
Hugo's wishes, was carried to the Pan¬
theon where he is buried, on a pauper's
hearse.

1881. Hugo's seventy-ninth birthday was the
subject of a grand popular celebration. On the
following day, hundreds of thousands of peo¬
ple filed past his house. Publication of Les
Quatre Vents de l'Esprit. Hugo attended the
first performance of a theatrical adaptation of
Quatrevingt-Treize by Paul Meurice.
1882. Publication of Torquemada. Hugo took
his last important stand when, in June, the
newspaper Le Rappel published his address
on the Jews and Russia, dealing with the
anti-semitic persecutions that had recently
occurred.
1883. Death of Juliette Drouet. Publication of
an additional series of Les Contemplations. In
the summer, Victor Hugo travelled to Switzer¬
land with his daughter-in-law and grandchil¬
dren. Publication of L'Archipel de la Manche
(The Archipelago of the English Channel)
which had originally been intended as a pre¬
face to Les Travailleurs de la Mer. This was
the last work to be published by Hugo in his
lifetime.
1884. In March, Hugo wrote a brief address to
celebrate the abolition of slavery in one of the
provinces of Brazil. In April, he addressed a
letter to the banquet commemorating the
anniversary of Greek independence. In May,
Hugo attended the concert at which Saint-
Saëns conducted his Hymne à VictorHugo. In
September, at Veules-les-Roses, he saw the
sea for the last time. In November, he visited
Bartholdi's workshop, where he saw the Sfa-
tue of Liberty Illuminating the World, which
was to be installed later in New York.
1 885. Death of Victor Hugo on 22 May, after a
short illness. He was given a State funeral. He
left behind him a vast amount of unpublished
work, most of which has now (one hundred
years later) been published.

Caramba!

Drawing and caption by Victor Hugo. The
caption reads: "Downgraded bird whose
cacklings have compromised the witch."
OF Victor Hugo what endures
beyond a name bracketed between
two dates, two bisyllabic praenomi-
na click-clacking like a baby's rattle or like
tiny cymbals in the hands of a derisive
deity? What remains of the enfant sublime,
the golden boy with the quizzical look and
the impeccable silk waistcoat, or of the
Homeric patriarch dandling on his knee two
chubby-cheeked children stiff as mechanic¬
al dolls?
Technical mastery? The greatest books
are not necessarily those that contain the
most spectacular writing. Technical virtuos¬
ity is not a highly rated commodity today.
A humanistic, libertarian approach? To¬
day power is but an effect of language as
we all know, national anthems have been
written that draw on the very vocabulary
that Hugo used, laced, of course, with other
ingredients, that are worthy of the comic
operatics of the zarzuela, strident back¬
ground music to drown the screams of the
tortured.
Upon reflection, one thing endures not
technical prowess, not lyrical power, but
the almost tangible vigour of revolt, the
carnal violence of provocation.
For Hugo's grandiloquence is akin to
anger, to blasphemy, to the climactic coital
cry. Language becomes flesh (sparkle gives
way to an abrasiveness that matches that of
Paul Claudel), idealist babblings become
trenchant talk (a ferocious torrent worthy
of Céline) and the lusty thrust of history
impregnates the text. True, Victor Hugo
nourished the fine sentiments of a whole
generation of the bourgeoisie; but it is also
true that his words were a liberating, disillu¬
sioning leaven, like those of Lucretius, eat¬
ing away at what it seemed to sustain.
Such subversive force no longer exists.
We are all, without exception, moribund,
managerial, institutionalized writers.
Caramba! What a pity!
SEVERO SARDUY, a Cuban writer who lives in
France, is the author of a number of novels,
poems and essays. His works include Cobra
(1972) and Barroco (Baroque, 1972). A new

in 1986.
