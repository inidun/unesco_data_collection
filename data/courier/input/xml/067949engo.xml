Declaration
of the Rights of the Child
By the present Declaration of the Rights of the Child, commonly known as the
Declaration of Geneva, men and women of all nations, recognising that Mankind
owes to the Child the best that it has to give, declare and accept it as their duty to
meet this obligation in all respects:
I. THE CHILD must be protected beyond and above all considerations of race, nationality
or creed.
II. THE CHILD must be cared for with due respect for the family as an entity.
III. THE CHILD must be given the means requisite for its normal development, materially,
morally, and spiritually.
IV. THE CHILD that is hungry must be fed; the child that is sick must be nursed; the child
that is physically or mentally handicapped must be helped; the maladjusted child must
be re-educated; the orphan and the waif must be sheltered and succoured.
V. THE CHILD must be the first to receive relief in times of distress.
VI. THE CHILD must enjoy the full benefits provided by social welfare and social security
schemes; the child must receive a training which will enable it, at the right time, to
earn a livelihood, and must be protected against every form of exploitation.
VII. THE CHILD must be brought up in the consciousness that its talents must be devoted
to the service of its fellowmen.

COVER PHOTO
About one half of the 40 million school-
age children in Latin America are depriv¬
ed of primary education because there
are too few schools, teachers and equip¬
ment. To help speed up the march
from this half-way mark to the full goal
of free and compulsory education for
all children on this Continent, Unesco
has launched a ten-year major project to
extend primary education and teacher
training in Latin America. (See page 18)
Within a period of six weeks each year the world
commemorates two United Nations anniversaries:
United Nations Day on October 24 and Human
Rights Day on December 10. This year The Unesco
Courier wishes to mark both occasions by devoting this
special issue to the theme of Human Rights Day 1957
The Rights of Children.
Our era has been an appalling one for children. Millions
upon millions awoke to life amidst ruin and death, and
the memory of those frightful days has left a deep-set
mark. If today, most children can look out on a world
less violent, the welfare of children has not ceased to be
one of the major preoccupations of the world community.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was
passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations
nine years ago is valid for young and old alike. Several
of its thirty-three articles deal specifically with children
and seek to ensure their physical and moral protection,
their education and full development. The Declaration is
not a treaty binding governments under international law
but it sets forth a standard of principles to which we must
all aspire if we are to live in freedom and in peace.
Over the past ten years much of the work of the U.N.
itself and of its special agencies such as the U.N. Child¬
ren's Fund, the World Health Organization, the Food and
Agriculture Organization or Unesco has been devoted to
implementing the various rights listed in the Universal
Declaration, whether such work was in the form of a prick
of a needle to prevent tuberculosis, advice on nutrition to
build strong bodies, the provision of schools to nourish
young minds, or the supply of powdered milk to save chil¬
dren from starvation.
Recognizing that the child needs special protection
because of his physical and mental immaturity, the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights has been considering a
"Declaration of the Rights of the Child" drafted several
years ago by the United Nations Social Commission (for
text of draft Declaration see page 29). The project was
debated in Geneva last April and the results of these dis¬
cussions have been transmitted to the member states of
the U.N. for comment. Detailed discussion of the Declara¬
tion is scheduled to begin in Paris next year. One can
thus hope that a new international instrument in defence
of the rights of children will soon be formulated within
the framework of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights whose tenth anniversary falls next year.
The Declaration of Children's Rights reproduced on
page 2 is the Charter of the International Union for
Child Welfare, an international non-governmental
organization having consultative status with Unesco.
The declaration was proclaimed in 1923 and was
endorsed by the League of Nations.

THE FIRST
RIGHT OF
THE CHILD:
HEALTH
by S.M. Keeny
Regional Director for Unicef, Asia
MOST NUTRITIOUS OF THE DAY FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AROUND
All over the world people today are talking about the
rights of the child. The rights of the child mean
many different things to many people ; his right to
be protected on considerations of . race, nationality or
creed ; his right to receive education and training in order
to earn a living ; and (a general belief we hold in the Uni¬
ted Nations) the right to live in a peaceful world.
Now we in unicef concern ourselves primarily with what
is perhaps the first right of the childhealth. Without
health he has nothing.
Sometimes it's easier to understand if we don't think of
children in the millions, but one at a time. Meet, for
example, Mrs. Srinchan and baby Ta, aged nine months,
from the heart of Asia. Their costumes may not be those
of your home town, but Mrs. Srinchan thinks as much
of her baby as does any mother anywhere. If you were
to ask her, in the stilted language we in the United
Nations too often use, "'What are the opportunities for
improving child health in Asia?" she would probably
giggle nervously and think you were even crazier than
foreigners usually are. If you were to ask her what the
question really means: "Can we do something to help
little Ta grow up a healthy youngster?" she would think
you crazier still ; for the answer is "of course"
Why "of course"? Because baby Ta is pretty lucky to
be alive even at nine months ; for in his part of the
world one baby in five dies in the first year (in some
places, it is one in two) and another one in five before
they grow up. In New Zealand, by way of contrast, the
death rate in the first year is one in forty, and in any
one of a dozen other countries less than one in thirty.
Why do they die? Come with me into a typical village
in Java not one of the worst. Put on your old shoes,
for it rains, a lot here and the "street" is full of puddles
of dirty water in which ducks swim and children play.
The families get their drinking water, at best, from an
open jar of rain water; or froin shallow wells or pools
into which the surface water runs ; or from the canal,
where people swim and wash their clothes and dishes,
and which they use as common toilets.
As we wander about in the evening we keep slapping
for no village in these parts is complete without mos¬
quitoes.
Everywhere about us families are eating together, sitting
on the ground. Usually the plates are green leaves. If
there are real plates and cups, they will be washed after¬
ward in cold water probably from the canal.
Inside the one-roomed huts the whole family sleeps
together, whether all are well, or whether one or more of
the family has open tuberculosis.
If the baby is sick, mamma holds him a little tighter
and hopes that love will make up for everything else that
is missing. All too often she feels that baby is hotter
than usual. But that does not mean the doctor comes,
for in this country there is only one doctor to 75,000 people.
No, the few doctors are for city people, and for the rich
even there. So baby gets hotter for two or three days,
and thenall too often is hot no more.
We are looking at just one village with perhaps 500 chil¬
dren in it. It is pretty much like the others in which live
three-quarters of the 1,200 million people in Asia more
than a half of all those in the world. The numbers are
enormous ; but the problem is essentially the problem of
that one village. And we should be thinking less about
whether we can help protect the rights of babies like Ta,
but where we should help first.

THE WORLD IS THE CUP OF MILK SUPPLIED THROUGH UNICEF FEEDING PROGRAMMES WHICH HAVE BEEN SERVING CHILDREN FOR PAST ELEVEN YEARS.
Of course, we can take the position that high death
rates are part of Nature's Way. We may think that,
unless many of these children die, there won't be rice
enough to go around, so that it is better they should die
young before they eat too much rice. The answers to
this hoary question, which generally assumes a static
amount of food in the world, are many. The conquest
of malaria opens new land for cultivation ; well people
can work better than sick ones ; new seeds, irrigation, and
better methods of cultivation can multiply crops ; even
the birth rate can be lowered, as Japan has shown by
reducing its annual rate from thirty to twenty per thou¬
sand in the last seven years. But the people who talk
about "Nature's Way1' usually stop thinking when they
have used the phrase. Besides, they seldom use it when
they are talking about their own children.
Into this eastern world, where half the world's children
live, has come unicef, as a symbol of the concern that
nations feel for all the world's children. Fortunately,
unicef need not do the whole job ; local governments are
already doing a great deal with their limited money ; and,
of course, the missionaries and many voluntary agencies
have been in Asia a century before us. There need be no
rivalry, however; there is plenty of work for all. In unicef
we have decided that we should not be paralyzed by the
all-too-common attitude toward the East that the need
is so great that it is no use trying to do anything about it.
Rather, we have taken the decision that we should select
for attack a few diseases that are the greatest enemies of
childhood and, among these, the ones where we can save
the most children from death or years of suffering for the
least money. This decided, we simply begin.
After we have got started, we push ahead wherever we
get results ; for, no matter how great the need, we can
give help only where the people co-operate and where
the government can organize the work that is to be done
with the aid of expert help from outside and from impor¬
ted supplies. We must work this way ; for our policy is
to spend money on essential supplies and not on imported
personnel for administration. Thus, in Indonesia, where
we have programmes approved costing nearly $7,000,000,
we have just three imported administrative staff.
The repulsive disease called Yaws is almost unknown
outside the tropics. But in Asia its dreadful ulcers, often
two inches across and half an inch deep, make life
miserable for at least twelve million people, half of them
infants and children, not to speak of the several million
people whom it has crippled. From time immemorial
yaws was just one more thing to be endured. But in the
last few years it has been discovered that one shot of
penicillin, costing on the average about five U.S. cents, is
an almost certain cure.
With the assistance of the World Health Organization,
unicef has financed three projects in Indonesia, Thailand
and the Philippines, which within the last six years have
cured nearly seven million cases. That is not all of the
twelve million, but the job is more than half done, and the
rest of it will be done within the next five 'years.
In this, as in all other medical projects, unicef provides
the money for the imported supplies and equipment, but
the World Health Organization gives the
technical direction to the project. Who
provides only a few highly skilled person¬
nel; foreign technical people supervise the
cure of the whole twelve million cases. next page

World battle against tuberculosis:
56 million children vaccinated
governments, which supply
hundreds of personnel and
which are responsible for
the projects from the
beginning. This policy has
been established both to fix
the responsibility with the
governments concerned and
to ensure that they will be
better prepared to carry on
after U.N. aid has stopped.
Yaws is only one of many
dangers that baby Ta must face. Most of our money
therefore, goes into a multipurpose project that tries to
help baby get a good start in life, beginning with the care
of his mother when she is still expectant and continuing
until he is well on his way to healthy childhood. This work
is at the heart of all our planning, but to get all the results
we want is complicated indeed; for in most countries
babies are not generally delivered by child specialists or
even by general practitioners. All except a few in a thou¬
sand come into the world with only the aid of the old-style
midwife, who goes about her work cheerfully chewing
betel nut, with which she not only consoles herself at her
work, but also uses as a chief ingredient for a poultice on
the baby's tummy to heal the umbilical cord.
If these slightly outmoded practices are to be changed,
nurses must be trained who are willing to admit that
Lister had something, and that there is nothing like
boiling water to put the quietus on germs that thrive in
hot climates as nowhere else in the world. Not just a
few midwives and nurses are needed, but thousands and
thousands of them, and so unicef is helping the schools
of nursing and midwifery to turn out more and better
graduates. The chances for improvement are excellent:
even in Afghanistan it is becoming fashionable among the
better families for women to go in for nursing a job
that would have been scorned ten years ago. The group
will still be much too small, and there will be considerable
"wastage" from marriage, as our technicians so anti-
socially put it; but it is a step. And the group, though
small, will make a good beginning.
Although mosquitoes bite adults just as greedily as they
do infants, malaria is a far greater killer of infants than
of grownups. In India, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, In¬
donesia, it is the number one killer of infants. But the
answer is simple: ddt. And so who and unicef, with
much assistance from United States bilateral aid, are
helping governments in Asia to apply the methods that
have been so spectacularly successful in Italy, Greece, and
elsewhere.
Tuberculosis is an exam¬
ple of a job in which many
different agencies can work
together, fao wants to get
rid of malaria in order to
increase agricultural prod¬
uction ; who as a public
health measure; unicef
especially for the protection
of children.
Here is a disease poles
apart from yaws. It is not
easy to discover and diffi¬
cult to deal with after it has
been found. We are told
that the best way to help
children is to prevent the
disease with bcg vaccin¬
ation. Nearly one hundred
and sixty million children have already been tested and
more than 56 million who needed it have already been
vaccinated. Mass bcg campaigns are more difficult to
organize in Asia than in Europe ; but the children now
vaccinated in Asia every month are about three-fourths
of all those reported for the whole world. Vaccination
against tuberculosis in underdeveloped countries is becom¬
ing as much a routine as it is against smallpox.
But what about the millions of open cases now living
with their families and infecting millions of others?
These must be found. Mass X-rays and follow-up of
suspected cases are all a beginning, but they are useless
if nothing more is done. There are. very few hospitals in
the area for all purposes and still fewer for the care of
tuberculosis. But Chemotherapy now promises a simple
system of home treatment and care that even Asia can
afford. But, to make it effective, thousands of home vi¬
sitors must be trained.
The children in Asia are among the most poorly fed in
the world. One of the basic shortages is that of protein,
in which powdered skim milk is especially rich. Moreover,
there is nothing to the legend that Asian children won't
drink milk because they are not used to it. They guzzle
it out of coconut shells in Thailand as readily as out of
enamel mugs in Spain.
Surplus milk from the United States is being moved
constantly to Asia. This is
no long-term cure for
undernourished children,
but it will serve to span the
gap until nations can devel¬
op with unicef aid their
own indigenous sources of
protein, such as soya bean
"milk" in Indonesia.
Some reader is sure to
ask : "'But can we afford to
keep up these expenditures."
Let's not get too self-right¬
eous on this point. In all
Asia, unicef spends only
about $5 million a year or
two cents a child per year.
That bill is divided among
about eighty countries and
territories. The half paid
by the United States is
about one third the cost of a single bomber, or of five miles
of a modern super-highway, and about the same amount
per year as American girls spend on home permanent
waves every week.
I've indicated five opportunities that we at unicef are
taking to improve the rights of the child to health. There
are, of course, many more. And we are constantly seeking
more partnerships with governments, voluntary and semi-
voluntary community organizations, and the international
agencies set up to provide technical and material assis¬
tance.
It is a beginning. We at unicef can see week by week
the changes accomplished by unremitting attacks on the
miseries that have beset children for centuries. We can
see the children gaining strength and acquiring new per¬
spectives and more skill and more knowledge with which
to confront their share of tomorrow's problems. We be¬
lieve by the time baby Ta is himself a father, his sons will
not only have gone far in winning the well-established
right to health, but can look forward to enjoying more
of the other Human Rights in the brighter days that lie
ahead.

STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL. In Asia one baby In five (in some
places one In two) dies in its first year. In 1957 more than 45 million
children and pregnant and nursing mothers will benefit from Unicef-
aided disease control and feeding programmes in over I 00 countries
and territories. Yet some 600 million children still live and die in
want. Three-months old Indonesian baby (below) has gone blind in a
few days through contracting an eye disease called xerophtalmia.
'HALF THE WORLD'S CHILDREN'
A human view of the
struggle to get food and
medical programmes started
among millions of village
children in Asia is told in
a recent publication, "Half
the World's Children,"
which describes the work
the United Nations Child¬
ren's Fund (Unicef) is doing
to help them.
Written by S.M. Keeny,
Unicef's Asian Director, it
is largely a personal record
dawn from his notes and
experiences ove^a period of
seven years of service in
that part of the world.
Mr. Keeny never loses
sight of the fact that you cannot bring health and
happiness to millions of children by signing a paper or
waving a wand. It has to' be done child by child and
that is the way Unicef works. The human factor rather
than the cold statistic is always stressed as the author
describes the growth from a period in 1950 of no relief
from suffering, to the establishment today of some 125
active projects.
Sometimes the villagers tell their own story: "Govern-,
ment aid often scratches us where we don't itch," is a
typical example of how these courageous people meet their
plight with laughter and fortitude.
Thanks to recent medical discoveries, such as ddt and
the antibiotics, Mr. Keeny points out, it is possible to
show that the diseases which can be wiped out to prepare
the way for better standards of health and living need not
be limited to smallpox, plague, yellow fever and typhus.
To this list can now be added malaria, yaws, trachoma
and, with reservations, tuberculosis and leprosy. This
fact alone leads the author to say that Unicef "has a good
story in terms of what the. sensible investor wants every¬
where, in business or in international projects: results."

'RIDE WITH THE SUN'
Crippled orphans in Haiti,
deaf mutes in Indonesia and
homeless boys from . the
slums of Lima, Peru, are
among the children who
have been helped by the
United Nations Women's
Guild in New York through
sales of the Guild's
Book, "Ride with the Sun,"
an anthology of folk tales
from member countries of
the United Nations. The
book whose stories are
arranged to '"ride with the
sun" from East to West
around the world was first
published in New York by
Whittlesey House, McGraw-
Hill Book Co., Inc. (Price $3.50) in 1955 and in the first
year, royalties amounting to over $2,300 were donated
to children's charities. In April this year it was publish¬
ed in England. by Messrs Edmund Ward Ltd., 144-200
Bishopgate, London E.C.2. (Price 15/-) and now a
French version has been published by Editions G.P., 80,
rue St-Lazare, Paris (Price 1,000 frs). The book will
also appear in German and Indonesian, and other edi¬
tions are planned. "'Ride with the Sun" is one of many
projects through which the United Nations Women's
Guild has helped children from Greece to Finland and
from Liberia to the Philippines.

AN AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE
TO FORTY MILLION CHILDREN
UNICEF
'ASSIGNMENT CHILDREN', took comedian Danny Kaye to the Far East in 1954 to film the work of
the United Nations Children's Fund in Burma, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Japan and Thailand. His film,
translated Into I 8 languages, was seen by more than 90,000,000 people. Here, on the steps of a Buddhist
temple near Bangkok, Danny Kaye endears himself to Thai schoolchildren by joining in a game of handball.
by Danny Kaye
I have some sober advice to offer in case an ambassa¬
dorship ever comes your way, and if you think it
couldn't happen to you, you'd better think again. It
happened to me and I was born in Brooklyn.
In the past three years I've travelled 100,000 miles across
Europe and Asia and into Africa as a special ambassador
for unicef, an organization that this year will give milk
and medical aid to some 40,000,000 under-privileged chil¬
dren throughout the world. I carry a United Nations
document so big you have to fold it six times to get it into
your pocket. It's very effective with customs guards from
Algiers to Bombay: but all its fancy language means, I've
found out, is simply, "Let this bum t'ru."
And that's not all I've learned. An ambassador may be
called upon to speak any language from Tagalog to Thai.
But don't let this scare you; languages are a snap. I
wasn't in France more than a week, for example, when I
was able to say to the benefit audience in Paris, "Je ne pas
trense electrol ensi tren toi". Pretty, eh? Imagine my
dismay when the audience laughed. It was all straighten¬
ed out when a friend explained that what I had said was,
"I can't help the train although the rattlesnake is
limping."
Not knowing languages, you can, of course, use an inter¬
preter. But you must know how to use him. I advise
breaking your sentences into even fragments. In Spain
last summer I used an interpreter because my Spanish is
not as good as my French. Greeting the audience, I said:
«T at
The interpreter translated: "Yo..." I said: "... am..."
The interpreter said: "... soy..." I said: "... very..." The
interpreter said: "... muy..." I countered: "...glad to be
able to meet with you ladies and gentlemen to talk about
the great work being done by the United Nations Chil¬
dren's Fund."
Such thoughtfulness toward an interpreter is bound to
be repaid many times by his undying gratitude. We can
dismiss the reaction of my interpreter on that day as
atypical.
The next rule I learned as an ambassador is also very
important: Always observe protocol.
The best way I can define protocol is to illustrate. In
Vienna, I called on Austrian President Theodor Körner at
the Imperial Castle. That day I had paid my respects to
the mayor, the minister of social welfare and the minister
of finance. My feet were killing me. When Herr Körner
came into the hall to greet me, he stood and talked. When
my feet could no longer take it, I asked him, "Wouldn't
you like to sit down?"
"But I'm supposed to ask youHe was flabbergasted,
that", he said.
"So ask me," I replied, grinning. This is what is known
as protocol.
Perhaps the most important ambassadorial rule of all
is this: Neglect no one. In Bonn last year, Unicef officials
gave me a banquet. One by one those at the head table
rose and proposed a toast to the guest of honour, me.
Each time, when the toast ended, we all stood and drank.
We were two thirds of the way through the brass when
I jumped up, raised my glass and shouted: "To the
gentlemen who serve Unicef! The Waiters!" And so
everyone stood and drank a toast to the waiters.
By now I hope you realize I'm jesting. I know no more
about protocol than what common sense tells me. You
couldn't get a top hat on my head because a golf cap is
usually there already. As for foreign
languages, I don't know themnot even
French. Continued
Nevertheless, I'm an ambassador, even
though the form of diplomacy I practice page 10
is limited to the little world of laughter.

MAN WITH A MISSION
Since 1954 Danny Kaye has travelled 100,000 miles across Europe and Asia and
into Africa as a special ambassador for UNICEF. He has seen and talked to the sick,
handicapped and undernourished children being helped by UNICEF, and with his
clowning, miming and dancing has administered his own particular brand of medicine-
laughter. Here he is seen in Nigeria where he visited a leper settlement.

AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE (*,«,
I've played to 6,000 Israelis jammed into an amphitheatre
beside the Sea of Galilee, and to a mere half dozen Greek
kids seated in a polio bath in an Athens rehabilitation
centre. I've clowned before 20,000 Turks at a children's-
day parade in Ankara, and before half a. hundred kids
with yaws in Thailand. I'm not swaggering about all
this, for the truth is that my association with Unicef
was an accident. I was about to leave for the Orient on
a tour three years ago when Maurice Pate, Unicef's
executive director, asked me if I'd look in on some of
his organization's outposts. I did and I haven't stopped
looking since.
I've seen a little Siamese boy whose skin was almost
overcome by infectious yaws cleaned up in three weeks
with one shot of penicillin; I've seen Korean kids drinking
milk who'd never seen milk before. I've seen some unplea¬
sant things, too, like Moroccan children disregarding the
clusters of flies on their faces, not because they were lazy,
but because to brush them off would do no good. The flies
would only come back. I've played ball with little Italian
boys balanced on one leg or catching with stumps of arms.
But wherever I wentand I travelled through 24 coun¬
triesI found unicef staffs giving the kids the same
devotion, the same quality of helpcolour and country
of origin no matter. That's what really got me.
So I did a little work to help these
kidsmy. kind of work. I tried to
make them laugh. I played to crowds
that had never heard of America, had
never seen a movie, couldn't tell the
difference between Danny Kaye and
Santa Claus, and what's more,
couldn't understand what Kaye was
saying.
So what? Kids 'will laugh at any
man willing to act like an idiot. To
those kids, I was the funny man with
the red hair.
I'd walk funny, and make faces.
I'd get mixed up in dances, I'd mimic
every kid I could. If he covered his
mouth, I'd cover mine ; if he waved
me away, I'd wave back. And I'd
listen hard to get the rhythm and
sound of his language, because among
other things I learned in my Unicef
travels that people flip if you utter
so much, as a single phrase of their
tongue. In a Roman polio ward, I
watched a nurse leading a group of
little boys in abdominal exercises. At
her count of "one", the youngsters,
lying on their backs, would arch their
bodies. At her count of "two", they
would recover. "Uno... due", she went,
"uno... due."
I asked if I could count too. She
said I could. I counted: "Uno...
cinque." Just that delighted those
little boys.
I have no desire to create the
impression that I think all kids are !
good, or even that I like all kids.
There are good kids and bad, and I like some and not
others. Some kids don't like me. But good or bad, Greek
or Siamese, their reactions are always the same. And so
are reactions to them especially when they're sick.
Adults want to make them well. I haven't met one yet
who didn't, and I've been looking for three years and
100,000 miles;
I went to Zagora, Morocco, in the summer of 1956. It's a
tiny town of 667 people who live in an ancient fortress
built on the desert. Zagora in the summer is frightening-
ly hot, dusty and insect-ridden a climate favourable to
conjunctivitis, an eye inflammation that usually paves the
way for a contagious disease called trachoma. Trachoma
strikes mainly at children. Often it blinds them. In some
southern areas of French Morocco, it blinds them all.
Three years ago, after a government study of preventive
treatments, 17 teams of health workers spent five months
in heat that reached 115 degrees treating the entire popu¬
lation of one foothill area. Twice a day for half a year,
10
Kamerabild, Stockholm 1957
IN SERIOUS MOOD during his European
trip for UNICEF, Danny Kaye tells a group of
young doctors at the Stockholm Medical
institute about the varied world-wide activities
of the United Nations Children's Fund,
they treated the eyes of 114,000 people with antibiotic
ointment. That summer, there was no conjuctivitis there..
I can't forget Luc.Dulière, one of the doctors in this
campaign. A young man, he came from France to devote
his life to the trachoma programme. I can't forget him
because every three or four weeks he gets conjunctivitis
himself. He cures himself and he keeps on working.
Because of devotion like this, Morocco's war against tra¬
choma is on the edge of success.
But Unicef personnel and local officials and World
Health Organization experts with whom they co-operate
cannot easily step into a community and go to work
immediately.. Often they must first overcome ancient
fears. Unicef workers four years ago set up a maternity
and child health centre in a small Syrian village. They
were ready for business, but they had none. Their
methods were foreign. They were suspect.
One evening a nurse midwife, trained by Unicef, was
roused from her bed by an insistent knocking at her door.
Several Arab men. stood outside. "Come quickly," one of
them urged. A cow was calving, and in trouble. If Unicef
knew all about delivering babies, here, said the men, was
a chance to prove it. The midwife rushed off with them
to the scene of the difficulty. There was little she could
do. But she did that little. In time the calf arrived. The
next day, there were women and children at the clinic.
I found perhaps the most striking story of the fight
against superstition in Nigeria. The
man who leads this fight is a fifty-
year-old Irish doctor who could very
well double for Barry Fitzgerald,
hanging eyeglasses and all. His
name is Charles McConnaughy Ross.
Ross went to Nigeria 28 years ago to
fight leprosy.
If he lives long enough, Dr. Ross
may- well see the end of leprosy. A
relatively new group of drugs
sulfone has revolutionized treatment
of the disease. Until a few years
ago to be a leper meant social
and economic ostracism. Today
lepers have begun to walk among
their people. The new drugs reduce
the symptoms and in many cases
hasten recovery. As a result lepers
who had stayed in hiding for fear of
being ostracized and had un¬
wittingly endangered their families
are now coming out of hiding for
treatment.
All this means much more than
just what appears on the surface.
The world's less fortunate people are
beginning to understand that the
more fortunate want to help them.
To the Nigerian or Moroccan this is
overwhelming knowledge. For per¬
haps the first time, he can see a life
of work instead of beggary. The
people I have met are proud people ;
they'd rather work than beg. Now
that they are being helped, they are
beginning to help themselves. They
are taking independent measures to
protect their health.
One of my firmest beliefs is that there is no common
formula for happiness. Each human being finds happiness
in his own way and time. To a Nigerian leper the idea
of mingling with nonlepers is happiness. I remember a
welcome I received at a leper settlement in northern
Nigeria. The lepers formed a large, thick circle, and when
drummers set upon their drums, some children began to
dance. I felt like dancing too so I got up and started
dancing with them. . Suddenly out from the crowd came a
young lady a leper to dance with me. We faced off,
shuffled feet, swirled and circled as though we had
rehearsed the dance for weeks. I had a great time, and so
did my partner. So did the audience laughing at us.
To be laughed at, you know, is the nature of comedy. At
one point I wanted to be a doctor, because the idea of
making people happy appealed to me. I never became a
doctor but I think I've made people happy by making
them laugh. And I think when you make someone laugh,
you're giving him medicine.

GREETING CARDS THAT BRING HAPPINESS TO MILLIONS
Children of all ages and all lands often speak in their
drawings the sensations and enthusiasm they can
express in no other way. It was the drawing of
little seven-year old Jitka Samkova, a serious, blond
Czechoslovakian girl, expressing joy for life-giving food
and medicine supplied through the United Nations Child¬
ren's Fund (unicef), that was the start of the unicef
Greeting Card Fund..
Jitka lived in a small town in Bohemia which, while it
had not been bombed during the war, had seen drought,
famine and the devastation of invading armies. Many of
the children had never tasted milk; some had tuberculosis,
and other little bodies were crippled and wasted for lack
of proper medical care. As part of a programme to help
war-torn countries care for their own needy children,
unicef sent food, medicine and public health equipment
into the little town. The undernourished children were
fed, the sick and crippled were treated and prenatal care
was given to expectant mothers that their children might
have an opportunity to live. All the children were tested
for tuberculosis infection and those found free were
vaccinated with preventive vaccine. Jitka was one of the
fortunate ones given tuberculosis protection although it
was too late for many of her little friends.
In an after-school art class, the children discussed
with their teacher ideas for drawings that would express
their gratitude to unicef. Then they went to work. Draw¬
ing on glass because there was no paper, Jitka drew a
picture of sun shining down on a group of gaily clad
children dancing around a maypole. Her colourful
drawing was one of nine in her school that was sent to
Prague for entry in a contest. And, hers was the one
chosen to be used as a poster at all unicef feeding centres
throughout Czechoslovakia. In 1949, it became the first
unicef holiday greeting card and was sold around the
world for the benefit of the Fund which inspired it.
Today, millions of unicef greeting cards are sold not only
to convey holiday greetings but to help feed other needy
children the world over.
All profits from the sale of unicef greeting cards are
used to aid sick and malnourished children throughout
the world. During 1956, approximately 37 million children
and mothers benefitted from UNiCEF-aided feeding pro¬
grammes, anti-tuberculosis and anti-malaria campaigns,
yaws control, trachoma and related eye disease treatment
and leprosy programmes. Many more were aided at
maternal and child welfare clinics equipped by unicef.
In 1957, unicef is aiding 45 million children in more than
95 countries and territories.
Through the years since 1949, the cards have been
designed by internationally famous artists for the benefit
of the Fund. The unicef gallery of fine artists, who have
donated their work, includes Danish-born Dagmar
Starcke; French impressionist Raoul Dufy; world-
renowned Henri Matisse; the British team of Lewitt-Him;
Swiss-born Roger Duvoisin and French illustrator Edy
Legrand. In 1956, Joseph Low contributed a series of five
designs portraying "Festive Times in Many Lands."
Indian-born Jamini Roy, who rarely permits his works to
be shown outside his studio, designed two cards that were
representative of Indian folk-painting. United States
artist, Saul Steinberg, designed the official United Nations
card which was titled "Bridge of Peace."
This year, unicef is privileged to present cards designed
and contributed to the Fund by four more famous artists :
Ludwig Bemelmans, Mai-Thu, Gladys Rockmore Davis and
Hans Erni.

PIONEERING WITH PEOPLE
How U.S. Children Are Helping Unicef
UNICEF
'HI NEIGHBOUR' programme of U.S. Committee for Unicef puts history and geography
in a new perspective for youngsters In schools, summer camps and youth organizations across
the U.S.A. while teaching them about Unicef's work. Each year the Committee prepares
a kit with the stories, games, songs, dances, crafts, recipes and sketches of Unicef's programmes
In five countries. Here, musical message of goodwill goes from New York to Belgian Congo.
Pioneering has taken many forms
throughout human history, and there
has been a fascinating story associat¬
ed with each effort of men and women to
accept the challenges of the new and un¬
charted. One such story is unfolding in
!>ur time. It hasn't yet been written in
part, because those who know much abouï
it are too busy living the story; in part,
because the ending is not yet known.
I refer to the efforts of millions of people
in many parts of the world to participate in
mankind's greatest effort to organize ra¬
tionally the international relationships
among our countries; I refer to the unoffi¬
cial, voluntary, non-governmental actions of
citizens, organized and otherwise, to estab¬
lish meaningful links with the United Na¬
tions and its family of associated organiza¬
tions. The United Nations Charter says,
"We the peoples of the United Nations...
have resolved to combine our efforts" to
accomplish the aims of the u.N. Many of
"We the peoples" are pot content to rely
on the indirect implementation of that
resolution provided by the fact that their
government is a member of the United Na¬
tions and various of the Specialized Agen¬
cies. They believe that the spirit and aims
of these organizations will be effective in
the progress of mankind only if and when
there is understanding and support in the
hearts and minds of the people.
There is nothing new in that philosophy,
but there are many new and uncharted
roads to be travelled in the process of
translating the philosophy into useful action.
Evolving relationships between non-govern-
14

mental and governmental institutions which
will strengthen the character of each,
planning activities Which Will be at once
meaningful to the individual citizen and
helpful to the international governmental
body, seeking a balance between the local
and national objectives of groups of citizens
and the international aims of the United
Nations family: these, to cite a few of the
most apparent problems, exemplify the lar¬
gely unexplored wilderness through which
new paths must be cut if "'We the people"
are to satisfy our responsibility for accom¬
plishing the objectives of the United Na¬
tions and its associated organizations.
All the world's work
Happily, the importance of citizen
participation has been accepted by
the governing bodies of most
members of the u.N. family and they have,
as a matter of principle, recognized the role
of non-governmental interests. Some, such
as the International Labour Organization,
have been exploring this area for much
longer than the u.N. has been alive.
unicef, the United Nations Children's
Fund, has worked closely with inter¬
national and national voluntary groups
since its inception. I think all would
agree, however, that much exploration re¬
mains to be done in perfecting patterns of
relationships and types of function.
Those of us associated with the United
States Committee for unicef enjoy the
exhilaration gained from our part in this
pioneering process, and we are honoured to
tell our story as one thread in the fabric of
the larger problem discussed above. We
know it is only one of the many stories
which might be told to demonstrate how
citizens and their organizations can partici¬
pate usefully in the work of the u.n.
The United States Committee for unicef
is a private, non-profit corporation. It is
governed by a group of leaders in the civic,
educational, religious, health and welfare
life of our country who serve as Members
of the Corporation, and by a Board of
Directors whom the Members elect. The
Committee employs a small staff at head¬
quarters, but no paid workers in the field.
The Committee was first organized in
1947 and was reconstituted in its present
form in 1953. Throughout its existence, it
has been devoted to three objectives: 1) To
tell the people of the United States about
the United Nations Children's Fund; 2) To
serve as the channel through which the peo¬
ple might support and participate in the
work of unicef; and 3) To provide com¬
munication between citizens and the U.S.
government concerning the participation of
the latter in the work of unicef.
The activities of the Committee may be
best understood in the light of two princi¬
ples which guide its policies and decisions.
While there is nothing earth-shaking about
either of them, it will be seen that they
have great significance in shaping the direc¬
tion of an organization's programme.

The Unesco Courier. October 1957
Our first principle is that passive partici¬
pation does not meet the hunger people
have to become a part of the u.N. family
and its work. In our case, this means that
people not only want to know what unicef
is doing to help the world's children, but
they also want to do something about it.
Carried one step further, it means that peo¬
ple who are given an opportunity to do
something about it earn the right to identify
themselves with the Children's Fund and,
having done so, become the devoted consti¬
tuents envisioned in the Charter's preamble.
Our second principle may be a result of
a particular situation in the United States
but it nevertheless has a broader validity.
It is that the best support we can gain for
unicef comes when the people see such
support as a logical and consistent expres¬
sion of their basic ideals. This means that
we do not seek to build a new and separate
organizational structure. Our goal is
rather to assist the many existing civic, reli¬
gious, educational, service and other orga¬
nizations who wish to include UNiCEF-relat-
ed activity in their work. The citizen
therefore comes to understand the Child¬
ren's Fund not as a new and unrelated
activity, but as what it really is an exten¬
sion of the objectives which he has long
endorsed through his church, parent-teacher
organization, service club, professional asso¬
ciation or other group affiliation.
'I brought Dad along'
The validity of these principles has, in
our judgment, been established by the
success which our efforts to carry
out the objectives of the Committee have
enjoyed. To cite a few examples:
On a hot mid-summer day Wayne trudg¬
ed into the offices of the U.S. Committee
for unicef. "I trick-or-treated for unicef
last Halloween," he said. "What did you do
with my money?" Amazing ten-year old
poise with a definite business-like air and
obvious determination to obtain answers.
He listened intently as he was told of the
milk and vitamins, vaccines and protective
medicines. "Good," he said, "Give me
some brochures to take home to Illinois.
My friends and I will do it again this
Halloween." After more discussion of the
plight of "all the world's children" we-
walked to the outer office with Wayne to
say goodbye. His father was patiently
waiting for him and we thanked him for
bringing Wayne to see us. Wayne's reply
was quicker than his father's: "Dad didn't
bring me, I brought him. I had business
with unicef!"
Indeed young Wayne did have business
with unicef, as do several million other
young Americans, and their interest is not
confined to Halloween but extends through¬
out the year. Of those who come to
New York there is a steady stream visiting
the offices of the U.S. Committee. Others
communicate their interest by letter some
laboriously pencilled with heart-tugging
messages: "I wanted to help cause once I
was a little poor too" or '"I have money for
the poor children. I love them. I love
you too."
The programme was started by one Sun¬
day School class back in 1950. Those
children wanted to share their typical
American holiday Halloween with less
fortunate children all over
the world. The idea spread Cont'd
and each year more and
more children take part.
The U.S. Committee pre- next page

suggestions, posters and stickers for the
half-pint milk cartons, which symbolize
the purpose of the programme. Local or¬
ganizations civic, religious or fraternal-
sponsor Trick or Treat in each of the more
than 7,500 communities that participate.
In many cases interest is so widespread
that a unicef committee is formed with
representation of all the major organiza¬
tions in the community.
A unicef Halloween is traditional with
children costumed as spooks, witches and
gobîins; it retains all the fun of ringing
doorbells, parties, apple-bobbing and the
collecting of treats. The "treats" are the
difference. These are "'treats" for others
pennies, nickels and dimes which, through
unicef, become life-saving penicillin, pro¬
tective vaccine and health-giving milk and
vitamins for ill or malnourished children.
These children have become Good Ghosts
of unicef and they share because they care.
They know that unicef, representing the
co-operative effort and support of more
than 85 countries and territories, cares for
all children for them too if ever there'
should be need.
Swahili 'Hi' in Guatemala
Imagine little girls in Guatemala City
calling "Jambo" the Swahili greeting
comparable to "hi" or learning how
to make "Palm Oil Chop" (Nigerian stew)
in cooking class. A young school teacher
helped gather authentic material on
Guatemalan children's fun activities for
this programme of the U.S. Committee for
unicef and then introduced "Hi Neighbour''
to her own pupils. And in Lagos, Nigeria,
a programme director for Nigerian Broad¬
casting is putting on a series of radio shows
from the music on the "Hi Neighbour"
record and the activities from the Kit.
Concurrently across the United States,
youngsters little and big in schools, in
summer camps, in many organizations
are using this same material. One town
had a Games of Many Nations Spring
Festival in which every youth club had a
share. History, geography and unicef-
aided projects take on new importance
when a youngster knows through fun
the daily activities of his contemporaries in
these countries.
This U.S. Committee programme is
three years old. Each year a kit is prepar¬
ed with the stories, games, songs, dances,
crafts, recipes, Fun-Facts-to-Know, and
sketches of unicef programmes in each of
five countries. There is also a record of
the music from the five 1957 countries
Guatemala, Iraq, Nigeria, Philippines and
Yugoslavia. From the gathering of the
material to its dissemination, "Hi Neigh¬
bour" depends on the co-operation, interest
and time of many adults around the world.
The material itself must be authentic and it
must give as broad a picture as possible of
the varied cultures that make up each
country. Its value to children lies in the
hands of adult leaders, adults who believe
that fun and beauty are clues to understand¬
ing individuals and groups of people and
that, through understanding, today's child¬
ren will be better prepared to meet the
challenges that their world does and will
present.
And so, the purpose of the U.S. Commit¬
tee's ""Hi Neighbour" programme is three¬
fold: to strengthen better understanding
between people; to stimulate the interest of
United States youth in the people of other
countries; and to broaden understanding of
unicef's aims and achievements around the
world. Other national committees for
unicef in different parts of the world and
other organizations working for the United
UNICEF
FESTIVAL OF NATIONS grows out of "Hi Neighbour" programme in a camp in New York
State. Here, young people learn to share fun and folkways of children in Unicef-aided countries.
16
Nations and its specialized agencies have
found this project a valuable tool. With
their help, the U.S. Committee seeks to
broaden this happy bridge to friendship
and understanding. In 1958, the program¬
me will be devoted to Indonesia, Italy,
Lebanon, Paraguay and Uganda.
Unicef Greeting Cards sold by local
unicef committees last year represented
almost 20 per cent of the total sold in the
U.S.A.
Then there is the unicef counter in the
General Assembly Building of the United
Nations. Here again, volunteer support
plays a tremendously important role.
Twelve months a year this counter is
manned by volunteers and their efforts re¬
sult in more than 15 per cent of U.S. na¬
tional sales.
The U.S. Committee, as is implicit in
what has been said, assists other organiza¬
tions and individuals sharing its interest in
unicef and in international co-operation.
Speakers, films, literature, national publi¬
city and programme assistance are among
the added facilities offered. The results
are seen both in more adequately informed
participation in such projects as those men¬
tioned above, and in the development of an
organized constituency which gives expres¬
sion to the enthusiasm with which many
citizens view United States support of the
Children's Fund.
Millions want to help
Among the more specific patterns of
liaison encouraged by the Committee
are such activities as joint planning
with the National Citizens Committee for
the World Health Organization in connexion
with the World Health Assembly which will
be held in the United States in 1958. The
Committee also works closely with the
National Social Welfare Assembly and
recent discussions have explored the
possibility of establishing a group within
the Assembly's Committee on International
Social Welfare to assist the U.S. Committee
for unicef in defining the welfare aspects
of the policy recommendations it makes to
the United States representative on the
unicef Executive Board and to the U.S.
government agencies which participate in
the formulation of this country's positions.
The U.S. Committee for unicef is one
of a number of national committees work¬
ing to support the Children's Fund in vari¬
ous countries. On the international level,
the Non-Governmental Organizations Com¬
mittee on unicef serves as a co-ordinating
body for more than 50 international volun¬
tary organizations in consultative relation¬
ship with the unicef Board. In their work
with the Children's Fund, these internation¬
al and national organizations, together with
their constituent organizations and indivi¬
duals, provide a dramatic expression of the
desire of the world's people to associate
themselves with unicef and its work. No
one claims that final answers have been
found to the questions of what techniques
and relationships will best carry this asso¬
ciation into a successful future. But, with
determination, vision and co-operation, it is
certain that such efforts will do much to
apply the vast reservoir of human goodwill
to support of the important undertakings of
the United Nations family to meet the needs
of mankind.

UNESCO DEDICATES MAJOR
PROJECT TO CHILDREN
For every ten children in the 'world, five have no
schools and four complete only a few years of elemen¬
tary schooling, according to Unesco's 1955 "World Sur¬
vey of Education". The world's most formidable task
in education and the goal of both national and inter¬
national efforts is therefore free schooling for all chil¬
dren so as to give real significance to the right to
education proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. In education Unesco has three main
goals : the improvement of education through the
exchange of information, the extension of education
and the promotion of education for international
understanding. These three aims are reflected in the
Unesco activities, on behalf of children which are
reviewed briefly on the following pages. One of the
most significant and ambitious of Unesco's efforts to
aid the development of education is its ten-year
Major Project to extend primary education in Latin
America. An account of the work planned for the
first two years of this project is given on next page.

UNESCO & CHILDREN (Continued;
Every country in Latin America
has compulsory education laws.
Between principle and practice,
however, there is often a wide gap. In
this Continent, as in many other parts
of the world, numerous obstacles have
so far prevented the full application of
the laws on education.
In two Latin American countries the
proportion of school-age children who
receive primary education is 80%, in
some others the percentage varies
between 60 and 80, and in 12 countries
it is less than 40 % (in six of them, less
than 30%). It has been estimated that
out of a total of 40 million Latin
American children aged between five
and 14 years, between 14 and 17 million
do not go to school. Even if there
were enough schools, 400,000 more
teachers would be needed.
The shortage of teachers is therefore
just as serious a problem as that of
school buildings. With three exceptions,
all Latin American countries are forced
to make use of teachers who have had
no professional training (about 36% of
primary school staffs). The provision
of teacher training schools is thus high
on the list of urgent needs.
Latin America's population (170
million today) is increasing rapidly
(between 1% and 2.7% according to
country) so that the number of children
of school age will have been swollen by
several million in ten year's time. To
meet this problem the countries of this
Continent are planning a long-term,
large-scale development of education.
About 18 months ago a regional
conference on free and compulsory
education in Latin America meeting in
Lima, Peru, under the auspices of
Unesco and the Organization of Ameri¬
can States, noted "the intense desire of
the people in both urban and rural areas
to improve their living conditions, and
to provide better education for their
children." The Conference hailed the
idea of a 10-year "Major Project" on
the extension of primary schooling in
Latin America one of three Major Pro¬
jects (a new feature in Unesco's pro¬
gramme, designed to concentrate its
efforts on important problems) which
Unesco was preparing to submit to its
General Conference meeting in New
Delhi in November 1956.
Two year programme
for teaching teachers
The Unesco General Conference
approved the Major Projects and
in March 1957, Unesco's Ex¬
ecutive Board fixed the budget of the
Latir American project at $600,000 for
the first two years. Under the approv¬
ed plan Unesco will concentrate during
the next two years on the improvement
of educational statistics, the training of
teachers and of teachers of normal
(teacher training) schools, the organi¬
zation of a system of "associated
universities" and the setting up of a
fellowship programme. Large-scale aid
is planned for four rural normal schools
and two universities.
During the next two years it is
proposed to award 80 fellowships for
educationists to carry out further studies
in the United States and in Europe; to
provide further training for inspectors of
primary schools and teachers of normal
schools and to enable school administra¬
tors to work at the inter-American rural
education centre at Rubio and to study
the operation of rural school systems.
Outside their own national program¬
mes, several countries have come
forward with offers of aid. Colombia
has suggested a regional educational
planning seminar be held at Bogota.
Bolivia has offered its teachers' training
school at Warisata as an "associated
normal school." As an "associated
university," Brazil has offered that of
Sao Paulo with its institute of educa¬
tional research. Similarly, Colombia
has put the Pedagogical University of
Tunja at Unesco's disposal; Chile, the
University of Santiago and its educa¬
tional research institutes ; and Mexico,
the Higher Normal School, the National
Institute of Education and its national
educational museum, and the Latin
American Institute of Educational Films.
Colombia has offered 16 fellowships
towards the Major Project; Chile, 20;
France, 18; Mexico, four (conditional on
the acceptance of its offer for associated
universities); and the Office of Ibero-
American Education, 15. Other fellow¬
ships will be forthcoming from Spain and
probably the United States. The
Unesco. National Commission for
Czechoslovakia has invited several Latin
American educationists to study its
country's teacher-training methods. Fi¬
nally, the Organization of American
States will co-operate with Unesco in
carrying out a vital project whose
problems, whether social, educational,
demographic or economic, are deeply
human ones.
THE LUCKY ONES. Smiling schoolgirls near Puebla, Mexico, are more fortunate than many children In Latin America. In some countries
less than 30% have schools to go to. Unesco's Latin American Project aims to aid national plans for making primary education available to all.

Clerical and Technical Training Centre
started In Libya by Unesco in 1950,
to aid the newly independent country
in producing the trained clerical and
technical staff it needed to man the
machinery of government. Its first
traineessons of taxi drivers, day
labourers, small shopkeepers and
farmers all found government jobs
waiting for them on graduating.
Unesco educational missions have
surveyed resources in many Member
States and have suggested how these
might best be used to lay the founda¬
tions of modern school systems.
Afghanistan, Burma, Korea, Libya,
the Philippines and Thailand are but
a few of the countries that have been
helped in this way. In answer to
requests from 22 countries and
territories Unesco has sent teams of
experts in the development of ele¬
mentary education to each of them.
It has convened regional conferences
for teachers and school administrators
to exchange experiences and discuss
common problems. It has published
studies on compulsory education in
many countries, on the extension of
schooling, the employment of child
labour, on teacher training, on the
language of instruction and. the
teaching of reading and writing.
During 1955-56 Unesco undertook
one of its largest technical assistance
projects in any Member State when it
provided fellowships for 83 primary
and secondary school teachers and
education officials from all over Yugo¬
slavia to study educational arrange¬
ments in 11 European countries and
the United States as a preliminary to
reforming Yugoslavia's entire edu¬
cational system. The fellowship hold¬
ers mostly senior teachers and
educational officials carried out
group or individual surveys whose
results are already proving to be use¬
ful in the planning stages of Yugo¬
slavia's educational reform.
Each year Unesco and the Interna¬
tional Bureau of Education sponsor
an international conference to discuss
major educational problems. Exam¬
ples : the financing of public educa¬
tion (1955) ; the problems of the
teacher shortage and the ways in
which teaching can be made more
attractive as a profession (1954). For
these meetings countries prepare re¬
ports on progress made over the past
year, thus providing a world-wide
picture of educational developments
and needs.
Unesco seminars and publications,
particularly those concerned with
the teaching of history and geogra¬
phy, have encouraged educators and
publishers in many countries to ana¬
lyse their textbooks and then ask
other countries to comment on ways
in which they feel they may have
been misrepresented in them.
Unesco's efforts to improve textbooks
and teaching materials for interna¬
tional understanding are based on its
belief that the only people who can
improve textbooks are those in the
country which uses them. On its
invitation 23 Western countries took
a look at their textbooks to see what
they say about Asiaand how they
say it. Eastern countries are to
study their textbooks to see what
kind of a picture these present of the
West.
The Unesco Courier. October 1957
Children are among the most pitiful
victims of war. About 30 million
homes were destroyed in the Second
World War and the number of chil¬
dren with no roof to shelter them
reached staggering figures: 1,300,000
in France, 8,000,000 in Germany,
6,500,000 in Russia, 2,000,000 in
Yugoslavia. By the end of the war
many communities to house orphans
had sprung up in all war-torn coun¬
tries. Unesco alerted public opinion
to the problems of these communities
and strengthened the ties between
them by setting up an International
Federation of Children's Communities.
Unesco carried out enquiries into
the problems of juvenile vagrancy
and published studies dealing with
its psychological causes. Fact-find¬
ing missions revealed the immensity
of this problem in Europe. In one
occupation zone of Germany alone
there were more than 40,000 young
vagrants, homeless and without iden¬
tity cards, living by black marketing,
theft and prostitution. In 1949
Unesco sponsored an international
conference of experts and directors
of children's communities to deal
especially with these problems.
War - devastated countries with
burned-out schools, battered univer¬
sities and ruined libraries were a
challenge which Unesco accepted. It
helped in the job of educational re¬
construction, of make-do and salva¬
ging. It launched appeals, m
collected and distributed I
donations. From Canada on
came books for the Far next page
East and from the United I
DESERT SCHOOLS. Since 1949,
Unesco and Unrwa (U.N. Relief and
Works Agency) have opened over
300 schools for about 100,000 of
the Arab refugee children from Pal¬
estine. Unesco has given aid in
teacher training, technical and handi¬
crafts training and fundamental edu¬
cation. This operation began as an
emergency measure... but for these
refugee children the emergency has
not yet ended. Here five-year-old
girl pupil, Karim Beshir, picks out
different letters of the Arabic alpha¬
bet for the teacher at one of the
Unrwa-Unesco schools in the Jordan.

States tons of school equipment for
Europe. In one year alone over
$1,000,000 worth of books went to help
many countries.
Through Unesco children were able
to join in the job of post-war recons¬
truction, those in the more fortunate
countries helping the ones who had
suffered most. Aid came from hum¬
ble sources: the pockets of school¬
children who used their savings to
buy Unesco "Gift Coupons." Through
such anonymous generosity thousands
of dollars collected in 18 "donor"
countries enabled needy schools in 46
states or territories to buy books or
apparatus. Help of this kind has
since continued to flow across fron¬
tiers. Since 1951 more than 300 ins¬
titutions in 50 countries mainly in
Asia, Africa, and Latin America
have received equipment and other
aid to the value of $750,000 through
the Unesco Gift Coupon Programme.
Greece was another challenge to
Unesco. Nine years of continuous
warfare had orphaned 380,000 chil¬
dren and destroyed or badly damaged
7,625 out of 10,000 schools. Unesco
undertook educational reconstruction
and launched appeals. The refugee
children needed schools, teachers and
equipment. In 1947, scientific equip¬
ment and educational supplies worth
$300,000 were sent to Greece. Schools
were rebuilt and equipped with Unes¬
co's aid and with the funds it receiv¬
ed from many countries.
Restoration of educational facilities
has ranked high in the Korean re¬
construction programme in which
Unesco has taken part under the di¬
rection of Unkra (U.N. Korean Re¬
construction Agency). Unesco sought
"first aid" for 100 of the neediest
Korean primary schools through its
Gift Coupon Scheme. Together,
Unesco and Unkra set up a national
printing plant which now issues more
than 30 million textbooks a year.
Unesco has worked closely with the
World Health Organization and many
non-governmental organizations in
studying the relationship between
pre-school and early childhood edu¬
cation and the mental health of chil¬
dren. In 1955, Unesco and the Gov¬
ernment of Thailand opened an
International Institute for Child
Study in Bangkok. This is now the
centre of a network of research in
child development which is gradually
being extended to other Asian coun¬
tries and to the Arab states. The
important role of the police in the
protection of mental health of chil¬
dren was highlighted in 1954 at a
Unesco conference grouping police
officials from 17 countries.
Unesco has helped to set up "pilot"
libraries such as the Delhi Public
Library and Colombia's Model Library
at Medellin, stressing at all times the
need to provide better children's
library services. It has recently pub7
lished a book, "Public Library Servi¬
ces for Children", written from an
international viewpoint and particu¬
larly adapted for countries where
libraries are in an early stage of de¬
velopment.
Meeting in the Unesco Institute for
Education in Hamburg, Germany, last
March, educationists, research work¬
ers and psychologists from 12 coun¬
tries, studied reports from all over the
world on the working and effects of
national systems of examinations.
They discussed the causes of failure
in school and what might be done to
improve examination systems which,
reports showed, are being criticised
in more and more countries, even to
the extent of wishing to abolish them.
Unesco Travelling Science Exhibi¬
tions have helped to develop the
interest of young people in science
and technology. The first exhibition
(Recent Discoveries in Physics and
Astronomy) toured 13 Latin American
countries between 1950 and 1952.
Since then four more on subjects such
as "Energy and its Transformations"
and "Man Measures the Universe,"
have toured Europe, the Far East or
Latin America. About three million
people have visited the Unesco Tra¬
velling Exhibitions.
Unesco has supported the efforts of
many governments to improve science
teaching in schools. It has published
eight volumes dealing with science
instruction methods in different types
of schools, and it has published inven¬
tories of apparatus and materials to
help countries now in the midst of
educational development to solve
laboratory equipment problems. It
has issued sets of 156 drawings from
which schools in tropical countries
can build low-cost science teaching
laboratories and in "The Unesco
Source Book for Science Teaching",
it has combined the collective expe¬
rience of the experts it has sent into
regions where the need for the pro¬
duction and use of simple equipment
is greatest. Unesco co-operates with
the science club movement around
the world, recognizing that today's
children are tomorrow's science
teachers, scientists and community
leaders.
The aim of the International Union
for the Protection of Nature, founded
in 1948 under Unesco sponsorship, is
to spark an international effort to
assess and safeguard the sources of
our food, energy and material wealth.
It works to educate people, and espe¬
cially children, in all lands to under¬
stand the value of Nature and to
appreciate its beauty, and it has
stimulated the creation of nature
clubs in many countries.

TV AND CINEMA INFLUENCE on young audiences is a special problem that has
been studied by Unesco. Through surveys, studies and meetings it has highlighted
such aspects as the production of entertainment films for juvenile audiences, the place
of TV in education, films and juvenile delinquency. It sponsored the creation of the
International Centre of Films for Children which was established in Brussels in March
1957 to distribute information on the production of films for children, to study the
needs of child audiences and to publicize films approved for them In various countries.

HIGH
The Unesco Courier. October 1957
ASSET
by W.D. Wall
Director, National Foundation for Educational Research
in England & Wales
Any community is likely to stand or fall by the use it
makes of the ability inherent in its citizens. This is
particularly true when we think of the most able
five or ten per cent of its population from which
leadership in science, the arts, industry, professional and
administrative life will be drawn. The researches of men
like Havelock Ellis, Terman and Burt have taught us
that the social output of highly talented individuals is not
in direct but in geometric proportion to their higher
ability and at the top end of the scale apparently small
increases in power may make enormous qualitative and
quantitative differences in the contribution made to the
life of a community.
High intelligence is a complex aspect of the human
mind. Partly it is innate, dependent upon the play of
genes in our inheritance; but, as we are coming more and
more clearly to see, cultural factors, experiences In early
childhood, the kind, length and effectiveness of school and
higher education, inhibit or facilitate growth in this as in
other respects.
What is more, the nature of this broad educational
experience structures the mind in a qualitative way. A
technological society tends to produce technologists as
much by informal contacts with applied science in its
everyday manifestations as it does through its direct
scientific and technical training. Indeed we may say that
the genius of an age or culture is both a reflection of its
social climate and in many ways determines what can be
achieved in its schools, and the forms in which its ablest
men will express themselves.
This leads us to another point which, though much may
be made of it in pronouncements about education, is rarely
fully realised in practice. Education, training, instruction
is never solely nor even principally a matter of shaping
and informing the intelligence. Human learning is as
much an emotional and social, as it is an intellectual,
process. Children, adolescents and adults learn in
function of their prior emotional growth and of the
immediate situation.
& 'egg-heads'
But it is more than this. As they learn at home, in the
streets or fields, or in school, children are developing
their intelligence in the context of attitudes to
themselves and others, of the satisfaction or frustration of
their basic psychological needs, in short within a
personality. This personality and their ideas of themselves
are formed by contacts with other children, their parents
and relatives, other adults, and their teachers. Children
rarely learn precisely or only what adults set out to
teach; usually they learn much more, often quite the
opposite of what is intended.
This applies to all children, but the highly intelligent
ones present certain additional problems. It is not
unusual for brilliant boys and girls to be in advance of
their contemporaries at, say, the age of ten by as much
as four or five years of intellectual maturity. This
discrepancy increases with every year of growth. At the
same time, physically, socially and even emotionally they
may be only a little, if any, in advance of the average.
Thus the question arises of whether such children should
be kept with their chronological contemporaries whose
interests and abilities they have left behind or whether
they should be taught with older children who are more
mature physically and socially. In either case, the super¬
normal child may easily feel somewhat of the ugly
duckling and find it difficult to adjust.
Another problem arises from the ambivalent attitude
of society towards high intellectual ability, an attitude
mixed of envy and fear on the one hand and of honour
and favour on the other. Just because they are more
rapid and penetrating in their thinking than others and
because they solve educational problems better, bright
children like intellectual adults, are often mistrusted.
School-fellows equal matters up by such terms as "swot"
and "blue-stocking" and adults apply the derisory epithets
of "high-brow" or "egg-head". On the other hand the
prizes in school and many of the prizes and honours of
life go to sheer intelligence. It almost looks sometimes as
though we wish to teach our ablest children that ability
is a strictly personal asset, to be exploited as a means of
triumphing at the expense of others, while at the same
time we suggest that it should be hidden because it makes
them different from the rest.
Trahison des clercs starts in schools
The results we so often see in the highly intelligent
maladjusted adult who does not fully exploit his
ability or whose intelligence, allied to egocentriclty
and neurosis, brings him to a position where his influence
is exerted negatively. It is this which is the real
trahison des clercs and it begins in our schools.
What then is the solution? In most countries of Europe
at all events and in many elsewhere, children at the
threshold of adolescence are segregated in some way more
or less according to academic ability. A small group of
the supposedly most able go on to a form of education
(Lycée, Gymnasium, Grammar School) which prepares
them for entry to the University or the professions. The
rest either continue in their elementary school or attend
technical, commercial or modern courses.
The result is that all our most able children tend to
receive the same kind of education a verbal academic
one. Moreover when, as in many countries, selection is
made by examinations of attainment and depends at least
in part also upon parents' ability to pay fees and to
support a child in school well beyond the compulsory age,
this education tends to have a marked social bias. The
able child from a working class family is less likely either
to enter or to succeed than a less able one from a middle
class or professional family.
Even where, as in England and in the Scandinavian
countries, selection is made on the basis of objective tests
and secondary education is free, it has been shown that
this social bias is by no means absent. Equality of
educational opportunity is only partly a matter of
adequate educational provision and fairness in the
allocation of places in different types of course. The able
child's own family and the immediate community within
which he lives have themselves from his earliest days
conditioned his ability sometimes in the
wrong directions so that he may be unable Cont'd
to show his true prowess.
Even when a child from a poor family
wins his way, the discrepancy between the next page
values and motives of his home and i

community and those embodied in the school and held
by most of his contemporaries may be too great. He
may then either leave prematurely or conform against the
grain only to find later that he belongs neither to the
group from which he comes nor to that towards which his
education has thrust him. Writ large this is the problem
of able members of a developing but still primitive
community educated abroad; but it is also a daily problem
in societies where academic education is historically based
on a particular social tradition.
Such segregation presents other dangers. The first is
that, however we may recruit them, abler pupils in the
academic school who go thence to the University and into
professional life are cut off from three-quarters or more
of their fellows at a time when social, political and
humanitarian attitudes are likely to be formed. An élite
is educated out of touch with the bulk of humanity. What
is more, because of the prestige of academic courses, able
children are implicitly taught tq believe themselves
superior to the rest and to despise much of the work
of the world to which they could make a peculiar
contribution. This may be particularly true in a country
in course of development which produces a surplus of the
academically trained who are unwilling to soil their hands
in the essential tasks. Such attitudes are intensified by
curricula which are often remarkable for valuing studies
in proportion to their uselessness rather than for truly
training the minds and personalities of the ablest for
the" responsibility and self-sacrifice imposed by their
superior gifts.
Because of this, many educationists have held that all
children should be educated together in the same schools
and classes, at least until the end of compulsory schooling.
The common school is held to be "more democratic". This
attractive idea needs close examination however lest we
confound equality of human value and human rights with
equality in ability and identic in social contribution
22
vastly different things. All men should certainly be born
free and equal; but it is quite certain that such equality
is a political and ethical concept not a psychological one.
Children differ ineluctably in their needs and abilities and
therefore in the kind and pace of education appropriate
to the full flowering of their personalities. Nothing could
be more profoundly undemocratic than educating all
children in the same way and at the same level.
This fortunately has never seriously been tried. Many
school systems have, however, attempted to keep a
considerable range of ability in the same class and an
even wider one in the same school, and then to
differentiate curricula through optional courses and
through individual and group assignments, to meet
differing needs. Some of the comprehensive schools in
England and the Junior and Senior High Schools of the
United States do this. The advantage is that, at least
until mid-adolescence, children of all levels of ability mix
in their daily lives. Many activities, social, artistic,
sporting, can be carried on together irrespective of
differences in sheer capacity to learn. Pupils can find out
that intellect is only one dimension of personality and
that there are other forms of excellence and other
instruments of service.
The practical danger, and one which is making many
educators, particularly in the United States, uneasy, is
that the abler children may be insufficiently stimulated.
They may tend to hide their light under the bushel of
conformity to the mean. We know too that able children
and adolescents gain from each other and from the
stimulus of emulation much that would not arise
spontaneously.
What then is the solution? There are probably many
solutions to the problem but their implementation depends
upon factors not all fully understood and some outside the
control of educationists. An educational system is the
product of a society and it is only by thoroughly under¬
standing that society that one can begin to change
education, and through education to improve society.
Hence lightning solutions and universal prescriptions are
impossible.
Perhaps the most valuable human attitude is a sense of
disinterested personal and social responsibility. Such an

There really were two elephants between the blackboard and
the class. And even the Thai children who are used to seeing
elephants were a little apprehensive as the animals swished
their tails and broke off nearby tree branches with their trunks.
Soon the elephants began to show the class of six-year-olds
what they could do: how they help their drivers to mount,
how they obey steering instructions, how they give themselves
a cool, refreshing shower with a bucket of water. Soon the
boys and girls were going off themselves, six at a time, for a
ride on the elephants. All this took place at a demonstration
school In Thailand, which is part of the rural teacher training
centre set up in 1954 by the Thai Government and Unesco at
Ubol. Here Unesco experts are working with Thai educationists
to develop new methods of teaching suited to rural areas, and
to breach old conventional teaching habits. A dozen head¬
masters in a group of schools near Ubol have said: "Let us take
a fresh look at our village and base our new work on what we
find here". When other teachers In Thai villages decide to
do the same, a great problem will have been solved.

attitude, coupled with harmonious personal development,
puts high ability at the service of humanity without too
much thought of personal gain or prestige. It has marked
the truly great men of all times and nations. It has by
no means always marked the bulk of leaders in art, science
and politics in all countries. Genuine humility and under¬
standing of others are equally important if leadership is
to be acceptable within a democratic framework.
Government by consent does not necessarily imply
government by mediocrity. It should imply that those
who have deep insight use their minds to help others see;
neither impose a solution nor withdraw aid in disgust.
Such attitudes and such personal balance do not come
to the able child or to the rest of us suddenly or by chance.
They have to be produced by education, and are unlikely
to be produced otherwise. They must be implicit and
explicit at least in school and preferably in the home too.
Differences between children and adults in all the
dimensions of personality and particularly in sheer
intelligence will however always exist and it is stimulat¬
ing that this should be so. Hence a rich and highly
stimulating educational environment, within which pupils
can choose the nurture of which they have need, is
essential for all children and for the able most of all.
This must mean that traditional curricula and methods,
many of them based upon outmoded concepts of social
and pedagogic aims,' should be closely scrutinised and that
while certainly the strenuousness of academic demands for
the able should be maintained, the fields of study might
be greatly broadened, particularly during adolescence.
The teacher of the highly able child then becomes the
guide, philosopher and friend rather than the instructor
he so often is at present; and the standards he maintains
are those of scholarship shown in all, and not merely the
traditional academic, fields. More even than with most
children and adolescents, with the able he stresses the
ideas of responsibility and service and provides real
opportunities of every kind for strenuous endeavour for
the benefit of others. Thus the educational catch-word
of "learning by doing" may acquire a real meaning. The
able will only be trained for disinterested social leadership
and responsibility by exercising it throughout the period
of their growth and education.
GREECE COMES ALIVE
BESIDE A SWISS LAKE
This year some 30 twelve and thirteen-year-olds of Neu-
chatel (Switzerland) Girls High School have been spending
a few hours each week in Greece. Of course it is an
imaginary trip, but it is one which has brought the country,
its art and people alive for these youngsters who live
beside a Swiss lake as no textbooks could possibly have
done. They know all about the geography of Greece, its
frontiers, mountains, towns and islands and what a day's
work means for the peasant ¡n the olive groves or the
fisherman casting his nets in the Aegean. They have studied
Homer and Sophocles and they have given performances
of Greek songs and dances. What is happening in
Neuchatel Is also happening in more than 100 schools
In 33 countries which participate in a special Unesco
programme of education for international understanding.
Not only different countries are studied; a school
in Ecuador may study Human Rights and another in
India, the work of the United Nations. The problem
which this Unesco programme is helping to solve is the
adaptation of education as a whole to the needs and
to the Interests of children living In a new kind of world.

THE RIGHTS OF
900 MILLION
CHILDREN
by Paul Almasy
The conflict over child labour
The emancipation of women is generally considered
to be one of the greatest conquests of the 20th
century. No less important has been the eman¬
cipation of the child by legal measures and the codification
of his rights.
Until the beginning of our century, children in most
countries were deprived of any right whatever. Their
parents or tutors were their undisputed masters. Their
physical and moral well-being depended entirely on the
goodwill of adults for whom they were little more than
pieces of property, the law merely protecting the life of
the child.
If children were nevertheless treated with kindness in
the overwhelming majority of families of all classes, and
if parents did their utmost to ensure a happy life to their
offspring, no merit for this was due, in most cases, either
to the state or to society as a whole but simply to the
happy consequences of natural instinct and maternal and
paternal love.
It was only toward the middle of the 19th century that
legislators began to take a serious interest in the juridical
status of the child. Public opinion was suddenly aroused
by news that millions of young people, many no more
than infants, were then living under the most revolting
conditions, that in many countries children were working
as virtual slaves, that boys and girls were employed as
labourers under conditions which defied every sense of
human dignity. . It was urgent that the law-makers step
in and put an end to such abuses.
With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, countless
working families rejoiced at the possibility of increasing
their slim incomes by sending their children out to the
factories to work. It was mostly in the textiles and food
industries that children between the ages of 10 and 14
(boys and girls) found it easiest to get jobs, for certain
jobs in such factories required neither physical force nor
the intelligence of an adult person. Reports dating from
1825-1840 relate that thousands of children between the
ages of seven and ten were employed in factories, forced
to work 14 to 16 hours a day, and received a maximum of
15 to 20 per cent of the salary of an adult for the work.
In England, for example, the children of needy families
suffered particularly, since the employment of children
was, up to a certain point a necessity of the national
economy. The Industrial Revolution had swept across the
country and factories, mines, etc., were faced with a
sudden need for increased manpower but too many hands
could not be spared from farming lest the entire food
situation of the country be threatened. Children were
the victims of the manpower shortage. Thousands of
children, no more than six or seven years of age, were
sent into the collieries. Hitched to coal waggons by
groups of ten, they took the place of horses in galleries
too low and too narrow for beasts of burden.
The situation was no different on the European
continent. Of all European authorities, it was the

AT THE END OF THE 1 9TH CENTURY IT WAS COMMON IN MANY COUNTRIES TO
Cantonal Council of Zurich which was the first to react
against the abusive use of children as labourers. By 1815
the working conditions of minors Were severely re-
glemented in the entire territory of the Swiss Cantons.
Ten years later, England too recognized the necessity of
intervening in favour of children working in industry.
In 1825 a law was passed making it illegal for children to
be employed more than 69 hours a week. In 1867, the law
was completed by an ordinance making a medical
examination mandatory for juvenile labour.
These two examples were followed -in 1839 by Prussia,
in 1841 by France, and by several of the States of
the U.S.A., such as Massachusetts, in 1842. In France,
legislation for the protection of children progressed in a
regular pattern. In 1841 employers were forbidden to
employ children of 12 to 16 for more than 12 hours per
day. In 1892, working hours were further reduced to
10 hours, and for children of 16 to 18, to 11 hours a day.
In 1900, maximum working hours for children up to the
age of 18 (both boys and girls) was fixed at 10 hours, in
1919 to 48 hours a week, and in 1936 to 40 hours a week.

legislators went unheeded since no organized control
existed to enforce the laws. Thus both parents and
employers continued, by tacit agreement, to exploit
juvenile labour. It was only by the beginning of the 20th
century that most countries took the stringent measures
necessary to ensure the protection of children and that
their lot really improved.
Today, in almost all countries of the world the working
conditions of young people are strictly regulated by law.
Since its inception in 1919, the International Labour
Organization has had as one of its primary objectives
the protection of children and young persons. The
international standards for protecting young workers
established by the ilo are embodied in Conventions and
Recommendations adopted by the International Labour
Conference at its annual meetings attended not only by
government delegates but also by representatives of
management and labour, all voting on a basis of equality.
Owing to this "tripartism", which is a special
characteristic of the structure of the ilo, the Conventions
and Recommendations adopted by the International
Labour Conference are instruments of great practica
authoritative value. Taken together they form what has
been called the International Labour Code.
The main provisions of the International Code
concerning young workers may be summarized under the
following headings:
1. The minimum age of admission to employment:
Young persons under 14, and according to later (revised)
Conventions, under 15 years, must not be admitted to
employment in the various branches of economic activity.
Higher ages should be prescribed for work which is
dangerous to the life, health or morals of the young. For
admission to work underground in coal-mines a minimum
age of 16 years should be prescribed and recommendations
are laid down to protect young workers under 18 years
against lead poisoning and employment as trimmers and
stokers at sea.
2. The prohibition of night work: Young persons under
18 years of age must not be admitted to
work at night in industrial and non-
industrial occupations, except under specific
safeguards in certain well-defined cases.

CHILD LABOUR (Continued)
3. Medical examination for fitness for employment:
Young persons under 18 must not be admitted to employ¬
ment in industry, in non-industrial occupations and at
sea unless they have been found fit for the work on which
they are to be employed, by a thorough medical
examination. Their continued employment is made
subject to periodic re-examination. In occupations in¬
volving high health risks, the medical examination and
re-examinations are prescribed until at least the age
of 21 years. Rehabilitation measures are required for
those who are found unfit.
4. Preparation for employment and placement in
suitable work: Various Recommendations lay down
guiding principles as regards measures to combat un¬
employment among young workers, the organization of
apprenticeship and of vocational training and guidance
services.
The standards laid down are of course not meant to
remain a deadletter but to be applied by the Member
States. In the case of a Convention, the State which
decides to ratify it is bound to apply its provisions by
national law and practice and report every year to the ilo
on how this obligation has been fulfilled. These reports
are thoroughly examined and if necessary the States are
invited to bring their law into full harmony with the
ratified Convention. Recommendations are less binding.
They cannot be ratified, but States nevertheless are called
upon to report on the extent to which they were able to
apply their provisions by national law and practice.
There is no doubt that the Conventions and Re¬
commendations concerning young workers have had a
considerable impact on the development of social policy
for young workers in a great many of the 77 States at
present members of ilo although it is hardly possible to
assess the extent of this impact.
As of June 1, 1957, eleven countries had ratified the ilo
Convention fixing the minimum
age of employment in industry at
15; eight countries had ratified a
second Convention fixing the
same minimum age for young
people in non-industrial occupa¬
tions. In a number of countries
of Europe the minimum age in
industry and agriculture stands
at 14, but a certain laxity is
permitted as regards its applica¬
tion to farms. The law, in several
States, permits the employment
of children in agriculture below
the age of 14 provided that the
child's school work is not interfer¬
ed with.
One principle which seems to have triumphed in most
parts of the world is that the minimum age for
young workers should correspond with the end of
compulsory education (1) . Thus the majority of industrializ¬
ed countries have fixed the age limit at 14. In the United
federal legislation forbids the employment of young
people under 16 (though certain States have legally lower
standards). Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand
are considering raising the minimum working age to 16,
while in Europe, curiously enough, the only country to
have thus far adopted the U.S. federal example, is Albania.
In some countries it is considered that a child of 12 can
be a useful and productive member of society, and the
legislation of these countries does not prohibit the
employment of boys or girls of 12 in either industry or
agriculture. Amongst these countries, varying widely in
economic and social structure, are Costa Rica, Egypt,
Haiti, Honduras, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, Portugal and
Turkey. In Egypt, a special provision concerning the
textile industry permits the employment of children of
9 years, and in the Lebanon where the minimum age is
fixed at 13 generally, certain special provisions permit the
employment of children of 8 years.
In Latin America, the situation is rather complex.
Argentina was the first country to regulate the employ¬
ment of children with a national law passed in 1907,
although one year before, Nicaragua had already passed a
mining code fixing the minimum working age in coal-mines
at 17. In Argentina, the employment of minors under 14
was forbidden and for young people of 14 to 18 years
working hours were limited to six hours a day. For
children over 14 who continued their studies the maximum
working hours were set at four per day. Argentine
26
legislators have put into effect a particularly interesting
measure: compulsory savings for young workers of 14
to 18. The employer must deposit a part of the youth's
salary in a savings bank; the youth cannot withdraw the
savings until he reaches the age of 18.
According to the International Labour Review (March
1954) published by the ilo the efforts and experiences of
the countries of Europe and North America have spurred
an important legislative movement for young workers in
the Latin American Republics, some of which are
comparable in result with those achieved in Europe and
North America. Nevertheless, according to the Review,
it is estimated that more than 12 million children and
adolescents less than 18 years of age are employed in
various branches of economic activity.
In most countries night work is prohibited for children
under 18 years in accordance with the International
Labour Code, but many are the countries that nevertheless
legally lower the age limit for enterprises where the
nature of the work is such that production continues day
and night. In such cases minors between 16 and 18 years
can often be employed. Similar exceptions exist for
industries in tropical countries where work is generally
considered less difficult at night than during the daytime.
Working hours of children are nevertheless limited so that
the child has a minimum of 12 consecutive hours of rest.
"It is undeniable", the ilo indicates, "that there is not a
single country in the world, even among the industrially
highly developed ones, which has as yet applied all the
provisions of the International Labour Code concerning
young workers."
In any event it may be safely stated that the internation¬
al standards for young workers have been extensively
implemented in the industrially developed countries.
There the premature employment of children has been
largely replaced by compulsory education, the age of
admission to employment raised
to 14, 15 and 16 years, the con¬
ditions of employment of young
workers strictly regulated and
the necessary measures for the
administration and enforcement
of the law taken. The problems
of working youth have thus
been largely resolved in the
industrialized countries even
though there is still work to do
as regards the strict enforcement
of the law, especially in smaller
undertakings and also as regards
the protection of children and
young persons in rural areas and
in various forms of non-industrial employment, including,
for instance, domestic service.
But it is in the economically less-developed countries
where the problems of working children and young persons
call most urgently for attention and remedial action. In
these countries, where poverty is 'widespread, and compul¬
sory education facilities are inadequate or lacking, many
small children are found working under detrimental
conditions for their health and physical development in
order to earn their own living or to contribute to the
family income.
In these regions, the standards of the International
Labour Code for the protection of young workers can, as
a rule, only be applied by stages and governments need
the help and practical advice the ilo is able to give. (The
ilo offers practical help and advice to countries who ask
for it under the agency's technical assistance programme
and under the Expanded Programme of Technical
Assistance of the U.N. and the Specialized Agencies.)
The protection of young workers cannot be dealt with in
a vacuum. Measures for the health, education and
general social welfare of children are essential for their
future well-being as workers and citizens. Where, for
instance, no compulsory primary education facilities exist,
it is difficult to prevent young children taking up work
and they will lack a proper basis for their later vocational '
training. This inter-relation is recognized in the "ilo
Youth Charter", a comprehensive programme for child
and youth protection adopted by the International Labour
Conference in 1945. Whenever appropriate, therefore, the
ilo deals with .youth questions in collaboration with U.N.,
Unesco and the other Specialized Agencies.

CHILDREN JUDGED BY
THE LAWS OF MEN
Society has always faced the problem of juvenile
delinquency. Even in the dimmest eras of the past,
an effort was made to understand the child who
unconsciously committed a crime. Only near the end of
the last century, however, was this common-sense
approach written into law with the creation of special
statutes for minors in penal codes. Action by legislators
was as necessary for juvenile delinquency as it had been
for the protection of child labour, for common sense had
often disappeared in the past. There was many a trial
of children in which the judge was guiltier than the
unfortunate defendant.
In the Law of the Twelve Tablesthe first law of the
Romans, dating back to 306 B.C. there were already
special provisions concerning thefts committed by
children whose responsibility for such crimes was
recognized as limited. Under the reign of Hadrian,
Pomponius declared that neither an insane person nor a
child could suffer capital punishment for a crime. It
was during this same period (2nd century A.D.) that
Roman jurists made an attempt at establishing different
degrees of responsibility according to the age of the
defendant. They set up three categories: 1. "Infans;" 2.
"Admodum impubes;" and 3. "Proximus pubertati." They
defined the "infans" as someone who was still not able
to distinguish between right and wrong and therefore
completely irresponsible for his actions. Certain punish¬
ments were laid down for the "amodum impubes" category
but infinitely less severe than those meted out to adults
for the same crimes. The sanctions permitted for the
"proximus pubertati" were much sterner.
Peoples much less civilized than the Romans also
admitted the principle of the irresponsibility of the child
in their legal procedure. The Saxons and the Salic
Franks considered the child to be irresponsible up to the
age of twelve. The Swabians and the Bretons were more
tolerant they granted children immunity until the age
of fourteen. The Burgundians and the Visigoths inflicted
no severe punishments upon children under fifteen. The
Lombards even went so far as to declare all persons under
eighteen irresponsible. Practically speaking, one might
well wonder how these rules could have been enforced
since no official birth records existed before the 19th
century and the exact age of a person was never really
known. One must presume that the judges
decided on the basis of the defendant's
physical appearance.
Beginning in the middle of the Middle
Ages and continuing to the end of the 18th
century, common sense lost ground steadily

BY THE LAWS OF MEN (Continued)
U.N. TEN-POINT CHARTER FOR YOUTH
and judges displayed unbelievable intolerance toward
juvenile offenders. In the Holy Roman Empire, children
were often executed on the same grounds as adults.
During the 17th century, the Paris Parliament pronounced
a certain number of verdicts which show a total absence
of logic. Thus on August 17, 1617, a young man of
seventeen wilfully killed one of his friends by hurling a
stone at his head. The verdict: punishment by his father.
A few years later, the same court but probably made up
of different judges tried a youngster of thirteen who,
obeying his father's commands, had put poison into a
neighbour's beef stew. The verdict: the child was to be
hung by the arms for two hours and whipped. A century
later, in 1765, a boy of sixteen was condemned under a
royal decree to three years in the galleys for vagrancy.
The Court of the City of London made the following
proclamation at the beginning of the 12th century: "A
thief may escape immediate execution only if he is under
twelve years of age and if the value of the stolen object
is less than 12 pence."
Outside Europe, peoples of the most varied civilizations
recognized the irresponsibility of children before the law.
In India, one law dating back to the 15th century deser¬
ves to be quoted as a humanitarian example (and even,
perhaps, as a pedagogical one) ; "Tf a child under the age
of five commits a forbidden deed, no matter how serious,
not only must he not be placed on trial but his parents
themselves should not inflict any punishment upon him.
Human beings of so tender an age can be educated only
by kindness and love."
Modern legislation reflects the tremendous variety of
educational methods now in use. To some authorities, an
offence committed by a minor should not be judged as
a crime but as the symptom of a dangerous state of mind.
To others, the personality of the child accused of a crime
is more important than the nature of the act he commit¬
ted. As far as the problems of delinquent youth are
concerned, modern jurisprudence is dominated by psy¬
chological, medical, social and educational factors. This
explains why laws and procedures differ so greatly from
one country to another.
In most countries the upper age limit for juvenile offen¬
ders varies from 16 to 19 years (16 in Belgium, Burma,
Ceylon, some regions of India and Pakistan, the Phi¬
lippines and Israel; 17 in Great Britain, Greece, Poland
and Egypt; 19 in many other countries). Norway and
Sweden have set up a special category known as "young
adults." In Norway, this includes persons between 18 and
23 years; in Sweden, between 21 and 25. For this special
category legislators recognize attenuating circumstances,
justified by age considerations, and have set up a deten¬
tion system different from that for adults.
Code of the Netherlands; for small children only protec¬
tive measures can be ordered by the authorities.
While children are today punished less severely than
adults, in most jurisdictions, the delinquency statute
includes a wide variety of acts or courses of conduct that
are not punishable if committed by an adult. Thus in
the United States, children and often, adolescents are
considered delinquent if they smoke cigarettes or use
tobacco in any form, or are beyond the control of their
parents or their guardians, or are "incorrigible", if they
associate with immoral persons, drink intoxicating liquor,
beg, use vile, obscene or vulgar language in public, or act
in a way which is dangerous or injurious to themselves
or others. In Jordan, any young person under 15 who.
lives in a house with a prostitute (not his mother) or in
a house that is used for prostitution, is considered a
vagrant minor. In several Middle Eastern countries, a
In the United States there is no nation-wide upper age
limit for a juvenile offender. The age varies in each
State ranging from 16 years in Oklahoma to 21 in
Arkansas. The upper age limit is also different for boys
and girls. In Wyoming, for example, a boy is legally an
adult at the age of 19 while a girl benefits from the pri¬
vileges granted minors until she is 21.
Many countries today recognize different degrees of
responsibility for children depending upon their age. A
distinction is often made between children, adolescents
and young adults. Children in the first category are
considered to be exempt from criminal responsibility and,
as a rule, cannot be punished by the courts. Nevertheless,
in certain cases where the court ascertains that the child
acted "with discernment", he can- be punished.
The minimum age at which a child can be held respon¬
sible for his acts and brought before a special court varies
widely from country to country. It is fixed at seven in
the United States, at eight in Great Britain, nine in
Israel, twelve in Greece, thirteen in France and Poland,
fourteen in the Federal Republic of Germany, Austria,
Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and
Yugoslavia ; fifteen in Denmark and Sweden; and sixteen
in Finland. No minimum age is specified in the Penal

THE OLD WAY to deal with the juvenile offender was to send him
to an institution in which harsh punitive methods and strict discipline
were the accepted forms of "corrective" treatment. Today most
"approved" schools, reformatories, and "model" training schools take
child under 18 can be brought to court if he is of bad
conduct and refractory . to the control of his father, guar¬
dian and, under certain circumstances, his mother.
Egyptian law forbids children to collect cigarette ends.
Punishments laid down by the law and penal methods
vary greatly from one country to another. In Europe, the
first complete legislative reform in this field was made in
Belgium in 1912. Previously, there were only unco¬
ordinated laws and ordinances. The same held true for
other countries. As early as 1908, Orlando, the Italian
Minister of Justice at the time, urged judges to treat
minors with understanding, but a complete body of
legislation concerning juvenile delinquents was adopted
in Italy only in 1930.
Above all, the most urgent need was for special chil¬
dren's courts with judges who were more than mere
magistratesthat is, where they were both jurists and
educators. In 1877 in the United States, the State of New
York set up not only separate court hearings for minors

but ordered the segregation of children from adults in
institutions, courts and vehicles for transporting prison¬
ers. These steps were far in advance of any taken by
European countries. In May 1911, a children's court held
its first session in. Portugal. In Switzerland, the Canton
of St. Gall created a "Jugendgericht" (children's court)
in 1912 and the Canton of Geneva followed suit in 1913
with a "Chambre Pénale de l'Enfance." The first German
"Jugendgericht" dates back to 1914. In Asia, Japan
created the first two courts for children in July, 1923.
It is interesting to note that in the United States,
where the first children's courts were introduced, crimes
of murder are tried in half of the States by ordinary cri¬
minal courts, irrespective of the age of the defendant.
In the States of Indiana and Rhode Island, juveniles
accused of murder are tried in children's courts ; on the
other hand, traffic offences committed by minors are tried
in ordinary courts.'
From the educational point of view, the philosophy of
justice and the procedure followed in dealing with juve-
Paul Almasy 1957
a very different view of their reforming role. Inthe past half century it
has been increasingly recognized that the problem of delinquency
is part of a much .wider one of mental and emotional ill-health.
Causes and background of anti-social behaviourare now closely studied.
nile delinquency are basic problems, on which depends
the extent to which the mentality of a delinquent child
can be changed. Intelligent treatment can, in most cases,
transform a juvenile delinquent into a good citizen. But
there are times when the child is lost to society on release
from an institution.
The view has become very common today that the
nature of the child's delinquent behaviour is unimportant
except as a symptom of his underlying emotional prob¬
lems and that jurisdiction should be predicated upon
"the child's need for help." Among educationists and
child-welfare authorities, it is now the generally accepted
view that the official and authoritarian agencies should
be used only rarely ; that the function of the court is to
protect and "save the child" rather than to correct or
recondition him.
A wide range of measures is at the disposal of judges
in different countries in dealing with children's cases :
reprimands which can be either punitive or educational,

school-prisons, probation, supervision, reform schools and
observation homes.
Corporal punishment was once accepted by a large
number of countries. Today, a judge can still order it in
Burma, Ceylon, India (with the exception of the Bombay
region), Iran, Iraq and Thailand. It is also accepted in
Pakistan but only for boys (this is also true in Burma,
India and Ceylon).
In Asia, with the exception of Japan, children can be
placed in prisons for adults, for lack of special institu¬
tions. In most countries of Asia and the Far East the
arrest procedures of children are usually carried out by
the ordinary police, on a similar basis as in the case of
adults. In Burma, the Philippines and Bombay, however,
special officers other than members of the police exist
to carry out these functions.
In the countries of the Middle East, parents or guar¬
dians can be held responsible for acts committed by chil¬
dren and ordered to pay a fine which, in Turkey, can be
as high as 200 pounds, in Egypt 50 piastres, and in
Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, 50 pounds. In Jordan, the fine
is unlimited but it can be levied only if the child's act is
attributable to parental negligence.
"Prevention is better than cure", the old proverb
reminds us. Thus, along with enlightened measures
which they have introduced to check juvenile delin¬
quency, society and its lawmakers have undertaken the
task of child welfare. In many countries specialist orga¬
nizations have been set up to safeguard the physical and
mental health of children and to assist their parents in
educating them.
Drawing inspiration from the "Universal Declaration
of Human Rights" of 1948, the United Nations Social
Affairs Commission drew up in May, 1950, a draft for
a "Declaration of Children's Rights" which will be sub¬
mitted to the U.N. General Assembly for adoption and
eventual application in all of the U.N.'s Member States.
This Declaration consists of ten points:
1. The child shall- be given the means necessary to
enable him to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiri¬
tually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and
in conditions of freedom and dignity.
2. The child shall be entitled from his birth to a name
and a nationality.
3. The child shall enjoy the benefits of social security.
He shall be entitled even from before birth to grow and
develop in health. He shall have the right to adequate
nutrition, housing, recreation and free medical services.
4.- The child shall be given opportunity to grow up in
economic security, in the care of his own parents when¬
ever possible, and in a family atmosphere of affection
and understanding favourable to the full and harmonious
development of his personality.
5. The child shall be given an education . which will
bestow upon him general culture and enable him to de¬
velop his abilities and individual judgment and to become
a useful member of society. Such education shall be free.
6. The child shall in all circumstances be amongst the
first to receive protection and relief.
7. The child shall be protected against all forms of
neglect, cruelty and exploitation. He shall in no case be
caused to engage in any occupation or employment which
would prejudice his health or education or interfere with
his development.
8. The child shall be protected against any practice
which may foster racial or national discrimination or
hatred. He shall be brought up in the consciousness that
he will achieve his fullest development and derive greatest
satisfaction through devoting his energy and talents to
the service of his fellow men, in a spirit of universal
brotherhood and peace.
9. The child who is physically, mentally or socially han¬
dicapped shall be given the special treatment, education
and care required by his particular condition.
10. The child shall enjoy all the rights set forth above,
irrespective of any consideration of race, colour, sex, lan¬
guage, caste, religion, political or other opinion, national
or social origin, property, birth, legitimacy or other status.

AL HOME
The U.N. Declaration of the Rights of the Child pro¬
claims that a child should be given the opportunity
to grow up "in the care of his own parents whenever
possible, and in a family atmosphere of affection and
understanding..." It would be a serious encroachment
on this right, which is based on the most deep-rooted of
human feelings, if the State considered "child care" as
meaning direct interference in the child's upbringing in
the home, except in special cases where parents or guardi¬
ans are unable to provide the physical and moral securi-.
ty essential for the child. As a general rule, State-care
is of an indirect nature, aimed at enabling parents to
raise their children under the best possible conditions.
In many countries philanthropic organizations opened
creches and day-nurseries for children of needy families
and established institutes for the crippled and handi¬
capped. These efforts greatly assisted many families but
they could not replace action by the State for the good
of the country as a whole.
Today, in most countries irrespective of political systems,
family allowances have become one of the basic measures
adopted by the State to help children, though the meth¬
ods used vary widely. In certain countries the State
pays a family allowance to all persons with dependent
children, regardless of social or financial status. This
applies to Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Australia and
Canada. Brazil and the Union of South Africa restrict
the allowances to families in low-income brackets. In
France, Belgium and Czechoslovakia they are only avail¬
able to persons who pay social insurance.
France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and . Chile have pro¬
gressive rates for family allowances, the State paying
more for the second child ,than for the first, more for the
third than for the second,' and so on. In general, allow¬
ances are exempt from taxation. Two exceptions are
Great Britain and Norway whose governments consider
them taxable since all families receive them, irrespective
of means. A special factor, related to the relative costs
of living in town and rural areas, . is applied in France
where a family with* three children living in a town, for
example, receives more than a similar sized family whose
home is in the country. In Switzerland, only the families
of civil servants and farm workers receive allowances.
Many other variations exist. France, Sweden, Greece,
Czechoslovakia, Chile and Uruguay all pay allowances for
a single child: other countries provide them only for fami¬
lies with several children. An extreme example is
Brazil where the allowance (abono familiar) is paid only
to families with not less than eight children. In the
U.S.S.R. a minimum of four children is required to qualify.
However, unmarried mothers are entitled to a special
30
allowance from the time of. birth of each child until it-
is 12. They may also draw an allowance for large families
if they have more than four children. If an unmarried
. mother marries, she retains the right to this special allow¬
ance. The U.S.S.R. and Great Britain fix the age limit
for children's allowances at 15. In several Latin American
countries (Argentina, Brazil and Chile) the age limit is 18.
Most countries have recently made great efforts to help
children in the field of public health. The Popular Demo¬
cracies, for example, provide free medical aid for all
children. In the U.S.S.R., factories and collective farms
have creches in proportion to the number of families.
Five per cent of housing areas must be given over to
children's playgrounds and /kindergartens.
Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries and the Popu¬
lar Democracies offer free maternity facilities and
treatment. In Finland and Sweden the State grants two
weeks' paid holidays to mothers with more than four chil¬
dren. Finland, Great Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands
and Mexico provide free classroom materials for children.
In France this is done by the municipal authorities. School
meals are provided for children in Denmark, Sweden,
Great Britain, the Netherlands, France, Czechoslovakia
and the United States, to name only a few countries.
Passport to patrician's rank
Many countries (among them Belgium, France, Den¬
mark, the U.S.A., Norway, Sweden, Australia and
the U.S.S.R.) make housing allowances, and some,
including Brazil, France, Sweden and Czechoslovakia,
grant loans for buying furniture; Norway has a system
of bonuses for this purpose.
The Netherlands is one of the countries where private
philanthropic groups working for the care of children are
most numerous. Special attention is given to crippled and
weakly children. Tiny Netherlands today boasts some 150
special schools for physically or mentally handicapped
children, with a total of 18,000 pupils. In Great Britain
the State offers free accident insurance to all children
under the age of 15.
Today throughout the world there are hundreds of
thousands of childless couples who eagerly desire to have
children. There are also hundreds of thousands of chil¬
dren of all ages, orphaned or abandoned, who are deprived
of a home life and the affection of parents. Society has
therefore instituted the procedure known as adoption, an
institution dating back to antiquity in some countries,
though in the past it did not apply to children. Thus in
certain civilizations an individual (of either sex), or a

couple could show friendship or admiration for an adult
person by asking him or her. to join their family and be
considered exactly like a son or daughter. Naturally only
unmarried persons could be adopted. Sometimes the
adoption was made for social or material reasons or for
dynastic ones. In his new family the adopted person
assumed the role and the rights of a direct descendant.
He could thus ensure the transmission of the family name
in the absence of a natural heir.
In ancient times and among primitive peoples adoption
followed a ritual. When the adoptive parent was a
woman, she (or in the case of a couple, the wife) made a
pretence of being in labour and of giving birth in a pub¬
licly-held ceremony. She clasped the person to be
adopted to her bosom after which she pushed him away
and let him fall to the ground.
Adoption was commonplace among the Hebrews, the
Egyptians, the Greeks and especially the Romans. Prob¬
ably the most famous example in Roman history is that
of Octavianus. He was adopted by Julius Caesar and later
became the Emperor Augustus Caesar. In Roman law
the act of adoption enabled a citizen of Latium to become
a citizen of Rome, a plebeian to rise to patrician's rank.
In France the adoption of children became legal only
in 1923 by an Act which made it possible to adopt orphan¬
ed or deserted minors. There had previously been some
exceptions, as in the case of the adoption by the nation
of children orphaned in the 1914-18 war. Switzerland
was one of the first European countries to pass adoption
legislation at the beginning of the century. Before the
Federal Civil Code of 1907, adoption existed in only eight
cantons. Legal adoption was introduced in England only
in 1926; in Northern Ireland in 1929; and in Scotland in
1930. Denmark's first Adoption Act was passed in 1923.
The principles applied in the matter of adoption reflect
the varying philosophical, religious, moral and social ideas
of different peoples. The law-makers of France, Italy,
Bulgaria and Venezuela forbid a man to adopt his illegi¬
timate child in order to legitimize it, but those of Greece,
England and Belgium encourage the adoption of illegiti
mate children by their fathers. In Spain, Cuba and Uru¬
guay members of the clergy are not allowed to adopt
anyone. In Colombia, Panama and in the Canadian Pro¬
vince of Quebec a couple can adopt a child of either sex,
but a single man can only adopt a boy, and, similarly, a
single woman can only adopt a girl. In contrast to the
customs of other times, many countries today forbid the
adoption of adults.
I'll take a 'problem* child
In most countries the law lays down strict conditions
about the age of the child and of its adoptive parent.
In Brazil and in Greece the adopter must be at least
50 years of age; in the U.S.S.R. anyone who has reached
his majority, in this case 18 years of age, can adopt a
child. In other countries the minimum age for adoptive
parents varies between 25 and 45 (Norway, Sweden, Great
Britain 25; Belgium 35 ; France and Switzerland 40). In
Great Britain the adopted "child" must be over three
months old, but not over 21 years. In Bolivia a child
under the age of 14 cannot be adopted, unless the adoptee
has saved the adopter's life.
In the United States adoption has always been widely
practised. Nowadays about 80,000 children are adopted
each year. On birth certificates no mention is made of
adoption and only the names of the adoptive parents are
given. This is also the practice in Germany.
Couples in the United States who are seeking to adopt
a child are often interested in "problem" children. From
humanitarian motives these couples undertake to bring up
a child who is handicapped in some way, either mentally
or physically, or who presents a difficult psychological
problem. Thus they provide for him the
kind of life of which he would otherwise Cont'd
be deprived. The laws of the United States
allow the annual entry into the country,
outside the normal immigration quota, of next page

A BETTER START is assured for children In
most countries today because of improvements
made in public health services in the past few years.
Guatemala, for example, now has excellent ser¬
vices providing treatment and vocational training
for those who are physically disabled. Photos show

have been adopted by citizens of the United States.
A minimum difference of age between the child and its
adoptive parent is a frequent requirement. If the adoptee
is a minor this difference must be ten years in the State
of California. In France it must be 30 years. Belgium
and Spain require a difference of 15 years, and Switzer¬
land, Greece and Hungary, 18 years. In New Zealand
there must be a difference of 18 years if the child and
adoptive parent are of the same sex and of 40 years if
they are of different sexes.
In France, Bolivia, Argentina, Denmark, Greece, Peru,'
Belgium and Switzerland, among other countries, people
who already have a child of their own, are not allowed to
adopt another one. In Greece it is possible to adopt
several children at the same time, but not successively.
Israel applies individually the laws of adoption of the
country from which the child originated. Switzerland, the
State of New York, Argentina, Denmark and Yugoslavia
allow an adoption to be revoked by mutual consent, but
such cases are rare. Seven countries have no laws what¬
ever on the question of adoption.
If the child is over a certain age, all legal systems
maintain that, independently of consent by his legal re¬
presentative, the child himself must be heard with regard
to adoption. This age ranges from ten years in Argentina,
the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Quebec and Michigan, to 12 years
in California, 13 years in Poland, 14 years in Bolivia,
Denmark, New York State and Peru, and 16 years
in France and Greece. In Japan the adopter himself must
obtain the consent of his own parents. In the Republic
of Ireland only orphans and illegitimate children between
the ages of six months and seven years can be adopted.
Both parties must be of the same religion.
Adoption is an ancient tradition among the Eskimos.
In certain communities of Greenland, 25% of the couples
have adopted children even those who have children of
their own. If the eldest child is an adopted one he takes
priority in matters of inheritance over all younger chil¬
dren in the family even if these are direct descendants.
In Venezuela the State reserves the right to nullify an
adoption at any time if it considers this to be in the
child's interest. Cuban law specifies that adoptive parents
can under no circumstances be the heirs of a child they
adopt. In Peru, Colombia and Panama it is forbidden to
adopt a minor if he or she owns more than a certain
amount of money.
The laws of most countries show a tendency to offer
more and more protection to an adopted child in matters
of inheritance. Legislators have always been mindful of
this question and extremely explicit laws were passed to
settle the formalities of inheritance in times when no
care of any other sort was extended to children by the
State. In very ancient times parents could decide them¬
selves whether their children should inherit their posses¬
sions. It was the Roman emperor Justinian who, in 543
A.D., promulgated the first law instituting the portio
legitima, or compulsory share which parents had to leave
to their direct descendants. In the Middle Ages, the Ger¬
manic countries adopted the system of the Pflichtteil (the
reserved portion), but for centuries, inheritance was a
question that was settled in many countries according to
common law. Parents could dispose of their riches as
they pleased, although the handing down of titles of no¬
bility and of privileges was decided by royal decree.
The care extended to children by the State today em¬
braces this question. The principle of portio legitima is
widely accepted. Where differences do exist they simply
concern the proportions and the relationship between
legitimate and illegitimate children. The U.S.S.R. and
the other Popular Democracies allow inheritances, and a
Soviet law of 1928 fixes the obligatory share of children in
their parents' possessions at 75% providing the total value
does not exceed 10,000 rubles. In France an only child is
entitled to at least 50% of his parents' wealth. If there
are two children each must receive one-third, three chil¬
dren at least one-quarter each, four children a fifth each
and so on.
While the care of the State in the social and juridical
fields is indispensable for the sound development of future
generations, paternal and maternal affection remains the
prerequisite of happiness for all children. Only a child
who is reared in a home where a harmonious atmosphere
prevails can hope to develop a proper moral and emotion¬
al equilibrium.

The Unesco Courier. October 1957
L etters to the Editor
Sir,
May I draw your attention to a
point in the statistics you published
(February, 1957) concerning the
world's most translated authors,
which I feel needs correcting. Your
attribution of German nationality to
the poet Rainer Maria Rilke is open
to criticism by both German and
Austrian readers.-
R.M. Rilke, who was born in 1875
in Prague, when that city was in the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, was the
descendant of an old Carinthian
family thus Austrian. He was
educated in an Austrian military
school and he began his university
studies in Vienna, continuing them in
Munich and Berlin. Although, in
1902, he entered the Worpsweder
artistic circle, his literary activities
and his friendships were based on the
Prague circle of Austrian literature
whose members included writers like
Werfel, Kafka, Meyrink and Brod.
Rilke,- who led an extremely unstable
life, was not only for many years the
secretary of Rodin; he travelled outside
France in Italy and Russia and one
might attribute a nationality for him
from these countries. But if we wish
to consider Rilke's national origin,
we can only describe him as Austrian
because he belonged to the German
speaking population of the Austrian
Empire. Above all he belonged
literarily to this same ensemble that
is the essential point.
The example of Beethoven can
throw light on this question. The
long years of creative work of this
composer' in ' Austria his artistic
homeland do not justify anyone
calling him Austrian: No more could
one describe Rilke as a German.
Both these men were, in the best
sense of the word, Europeans. But
there is still some way to go before
their kind of Europe will exist. In the
meantime Austrians would like to
claim Rilke, even if his works have in¬
fluenced the entire German language
field.
Hugo Pepper
Vienna, Austria
Sir,
In your May number you gave very
generous space to my article '"Forty
Jumps through the Universe", but you
were forced, through lack of space,
to cut its conclusion. I shall there¬
fore be glad, if you will enable me to
give expression to it in this way.
I stated then that "it is a matter of
life and death for the whole of man¬
kind, that we learn to live together,
and that our children be educated in
a spirit of tolerance and mutual res¬
pect, regardless of differences of birth
and upbringing, of nationality or race,
of creed or conviction."
What I had wanted to add was that
there is a real need for an "In¬
ternational Children's Community",
where such education can best be
given, and where men and women of
all races, faiths, nationalities and
convictions can send their children to
be educated in that spirit.
As educators and teachers in it men
and women must be chosen, who
themselves live above the separating
boundaries, and who are willing to
devote themselves disinterestedly to
the great task.
Sections of such a world-wide chil¬
dren's community could then be
formed in all countries. Through the
intermediary of Unesco the boys and
girls who would be educated in these
institutions should then be enabled to
finish their higher education in Uni¬
versities all over the world. From
them should one day come the best
prepared personalities who can carry
on the manifold activities of the
United Nations. A Foundation, the
"Werplaats International Children's
Community", was formed, which aims
at creating such an institution. As
Secretary of this Foundation I shall
be glad to get into touch with readers
of The Unesco Courier who might
help to make the plan materialize.

Sir,
In the city of Jaroslave where I
live, I was fortunate to obtain the
January number of your wonderful
magazine The Unesco Courier. The
contents of the magazine and the
quality of the reproductions are
delightful. I am passionately fond of
art, particularly of the fine arts
(besides that I am a teacher of English
and have published my first little
book of lyric poetry).
I beg you to help me with your
advice. I want to buy some (more
attractive to me) numbers of your
magazine, which were published in
1956. How is it possible to become
acquainted with their contents? What
must I do to get these numbers? The
New York Graphic Society publishes
the series of Albums on World Art.
I dream of some of them, particularly
of the Indian Album.

From the Unesco Newsroom...
¡5 UPPORT FOR UNESCO PACTS:
The United Kingdom, one of the world's
three leading book-producing countries,
recently joined the Universal Copyright
Convention sponsored by unesco. Twenty-
seven countries have now joined the Con¬
vention whose purpose is to fill gaps in
international copyright legislation under
which certain countries are bound by one
Convention, others by a different one, and
still others by no agreement at all. Recent¬
ly too, the Federal Republic of Germany
became the 25th country to apply the
Unesco-sponsored international agreement
which exempts books, newspapers, maga¬
zines and works of art from import duties.
The agreement also covers educational
films, newsreels, recordings and science
equipment, if sent to approved institutions
in participating countries.
'ASIA MONTH' IN THE U.S.A.: An
Asian month will be held in the United
States during November this year when
cultural institutions of all kinds will
work to promote better understanding
of Asian countries amongst the general
public. The programme will coincide
with the Sixth .National Conference of
the United States National Commission
for UNESCO being held in San Francisco,
which has for its theme "Mutual Ap¬
preciation: Asia and the West".
M. RAINING FOR JOURNALISTS:
An International Institute for Advanced
Studies in Journalism will open at the Uni¬
versity of Strasbourg on October 15. Esta¬
blished with support from unesco and aid
from the French Government, this Centre
will serve countries in Europe, North Afri¬
ca and the Middle East, bringing together
professional and academic experience and
newsroom and classroom skills for journa¬
listic training. It is the first of a series of
regional centres envisaged in unesco's pro¬
gramme for improved training facilities for
information personnel. Among the "stu¬
dents" of the first course will be holders
of Unesco fellowships from ten countries,
including teachers of journalism, experien¬
ced journalists interested in teaching, or
graduates who intend to take up a career
of teaching in this field.
WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN HAITI:
Haiti has signed the United Nations
Convention on the Political Rights of
Women, under which women are enti¬
tled to vote, hold public office and
exercise other public functions on equal
terms with men. The Convention,
adopted by the U.N. General Assembly
in December 1952, has so far been
signed by 40 other countries. Of these,
27 have ratified or acceded to the Con¬
vention.
^ERN CYCLOTRON IN ACTION:
The synchro-cyclotron built by the Euro¬
pean Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN) at Meyring, near Geneva the
third biggest of its kind in the world
is now operating at full strength. After
. just over two years of intensive work tests
were carried out with the machine run¬
ning at its peak outpu't of 600 million elec¬
tron volts. The second CERN high
energy accelerator, a 25,000 million elec¬
tron volt proton synchrotron, is still under
construction and is expected to be comple¬
ted by late 1960. Both machines are de¬
signed to further the study of the funda¬
mental nature of matter. Twelve European
countries are sharing the financial cost of
the undertaking. The results are made
available to scientists all over the world.
NEWS FOR PHILATELISTS: Two
new stamps in the United Nations se¬
ries are to be issued on October 24
U.N. Day. Printed in 3-cent and 8-cent
denominations, the stamps which ho¬
nour the Security Council, show the
U.N. emblem shedding light on the
globe. They were designed by Rashid-ud
Din, ' a Pakistani member of the U.N.
Secretariat. Meanwhile, the U.N: Pos¬
tal Administration has also announced
that four of the regular issue stamps,
originally printed in 1951, have been
re-printed. The stamps are the regular
20 and 25-cent denominations, as well
as the 12 and 25-cent airmail stamps.
FiLYING UPACCIDENTS DOWN :
Over 10,000,000 more passengers used the
world's regular airlines in 1956 than in the
previous year an increase of over 16 per
cent. The safety record was "the best
result yet achieved for scheduled air services
as a whole". These facts are revealed
in the annual report of the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a
Specialized Agency of the United
Nations, which also notes that the lar¬
gest increases occurred on the Far East and
North Atlantic routes. In the latter case,
passenger traffic rose by 20 per cent.
EDUCATION TN A GLOBAL
SOCIETY: . "The elementary schools
that will make the greatest contribution
to life in the next generation will be
those that are related to the world
community, yet firmly anchored in their
home communities." This opening
quotation expresses the theme of
"Introducing Children to the World",
a book by Dr. Leonard S. Kenworthy,
Associate Professor of Education at
Brooklyn College, New York. Dr. Ken-
worthy, who was formerly in charge of
the Education for International Under¬
standing Section of Unesco, believes
that the most urgent task of the school
today is that of educating children to an
awareness of their country's inter¬
dependence with the rest of the world,
and he has outlined methods and
materials for teaching children these
realities. The book is published by
Harper and Brothers, 49 East 33rd
Street, New York 16, N.Y., Price $ 3.75.
