Neolithic eye-opener
This finely-modelled terracotta head with its prominent eyes and long nose dates back to the
Neolithic era some 5,000 years ago. It was discovered in Yugoslavia near Pristina (Socialist
Republic of Serbia). In recent years Yugoslav archaeologists have unearthed many human or
animal pottery figurines, and realistic or stylized heads like this one, skillfully wrought by artists
of the prehistoric farming communities in the Balkans. No comparable works of the same period
have been found anywhere else in Europe.

AT two minutes past three on the
morning of Wednesday 4 Feb¬
ruary 1976, the stresses that had been
gradually, accumulating deep in the
Earth's crust under the mountains' of
Guatemala reached the point of rup¬
ture. Within the minute that followed,
22,000 persons died, 75,000 were
injured and over one million left with¬
out homes in a broad zone, 100 miles

long, running south and west of Guate¬
mala City.
Once again, an earthquake had
shown its immense power of destruc¬
tion, unequalled even by modern
weapons of war; once again, an earth¬
quake took its heaviest toll of human
lives, among the poorer sections living
in houses neither designed nor able
to withstand its force.
As soon as this disaster became
known, offers of help flowed into Gua¬
temala from the four quarters of the
world. The United Nations Disaster
Relief Co-ordinator sent a special rep¬
resentative to assist the Government
of Guatemala in co-ordinating this aid
and in dealing with the immediate
problems of rescue and relief. Unes¬
co's help was more concerned with
reconstruction after the disaster and
took the form of experts in seismology
in earthquake-resistant rural housing,
in school buildings and in the protec¬
tion of the cultural monuments with
which Guatemala is so richly endowed.
This was the immediate reaction.
The basic problem remained: how to
prevent such disasters from occurring
again in the future. The answer is
simple. The earthquake problem will
have been solved when every house,
every building and all the other works
of man in the world's seismic zones
will have been designed and built or
strengthened to resist earthquakes.
This will surely be done one day, but
it will probably take several genera¬
tions.
Why so long? The reason is, that

earthquake-resistant design and con-

struction are known, and the details
have been worked out for modern
buildings. in steel and concrete and for
important public works, relatively little
effort has yet been put into the earth¬
quake-resistant design of rural and
low-cost housing.
In the world's seismic zones about
2,000 million people live in houses,
many of which they have built them¬
selves, not designed or engineered to
resist earthquakes. It will certainly be
many years before the principles and
practice of earthquake-resistant build¬
ing reach these grass roots. In the
meantime, even in the cities, we shall
have to continue for a long time yet
to live and work in older buildings
which are not earthquake-resistant but
which, for a variety of reasons, must
remain In use.
It is this that makes it so important
to develop means of predicting earth¬
quakes. This will not prevent damage
but at least it will save lives if predic¬
tions can be made with the accuracy
sufficient for public warning services.
The ultimate goal Is to achieve
immunity from earthquakes throughout
the world's seismic zones. But where
are these zones? It is important to
know, because earthquake-resistant
design and construction adds to the
cost of building (between 5 and 20 per
cent, according to the type of building,
the materials used and the magnitude
of the earthquake risk).
The main seismic zones of the world,
the circum-Pacific belt, the Mediterra¬
nean - Alpine - Hindu Kush - Himalayan
zone, etc., have been known for a long
time, but it is only recently that the
concepts of plate tectonics (continental
drift) have provided a logical expla¬
nation of the large-scale pattern of
seismicity.
What still remains to be done in
most parts of the world is to study
and define this pattern in more detail
and to express our knowledge of the
earthquake phenomenon in terms that
are useful to the architect and the
design engineer. For them, it is not
sufficient simply to know that the risk
of earthquake exists; this risk has to
be quantified in terms of the prob¬
ability of occurrence of certain accel¬
erations or velocities of ground
movement.
These and many other problems
were discussed at an inter-govern¬
mental conference on the assessment ^
and mitigation of earthquake risk that r

World's great earthquake belts
* Disasters surveyed by Unesco earthquake reconnaissance missions
y was held at Unesco headquarters in
Paris on 10-19 February 1976, only a
few days after the catastrophic earth¬
quake in Guatemala. Over 180 per¬
sons attended this conference, includ¬
ing the delegates of 52 member states
of Unesco and the representatives of
15 international organizations.
The conference had two main objec¬
tives: firstly, to examine the present
state of knowledge regarding earth¬
quakes and the means of protection
against them; secondly, to identify the
obstacles which prevent the fullest
possible use being made of existing
knowledge, and to seek ways of over¬
coming them. In other words, the
conference looked at the earthquake
problem from the governmental rather
than from the purely scientific and
technical point of view.
The conference thus differed from
other international meetings on this
subject, in that it discussed not only
the nature of earthquakes and the
engineering means to reduce ' the
losses caused by them, but also their
human, social and economic impli¬
cations.
Some of the most interesting and
fruitful discussions were those which
took place between seismologists,
social scientists, insurance experts
and civil defence specialists. It was
clear that much still remains to be done
in order to provide policy makers with
the data on which to base government
decisions with regard to investment in
earthquake research, in protective
measures, or in insurance.
Another scientific subject with im¬
portant human, social and economic
overtones is that of earthquake pre¬
diction. The general feeling before
the conference was that, although the
prediction of earthquakes as a scien¬
tific exercise might well become
feasible within the next few years, at
least in areas subjected to intense
instrumental surveillance, it would
probably be a long time before the
degree of accuracy required by a
public warning service was achieved.
Furthermore, there was reason to
believe that, in many social contexts.
the announcement of an impending
destructive earthquake might have
consequences almost as serious as
the earthquake itself, not to speak of
the adverse reaction that might be
expected from the public to any false
alarm.
The conference therefore listened
with particular interest to the report
of the Chinese delegation on the
methods used in that country, and^

W particularly on the successful predic-
^ tion of the earthquake at Hai Cheng
on 4 February 1975 (see article
page 11).
The wide range of scientific tech¬
niques employed and, above all, the
involvement of large numbers of ama¬
teur observers in efforts to detect the
signs of imminent earthquake shocks,
were of particular interest and demon¬
strated that, in the Chinese context
at least, an earthquake warning system
can be made to operate successfully.
The ensuing debate on this subject
showed that, while the general scien¬
tific approach to the earthquake pre¬
diction problem was the same in all
countries, the social problems raised
by earthquake forecasting were likely
to differ widely from country to
country.
The conference adopted over 40 res¬
olutions on technical matters, whose
implementation will demand many
years of effort on the part of Unesco
and of its member states. Will this
effort be made? In these days of
financial stringency, this is a question
that may well be asked. Although no
immediate answer can be given, it is
worth looking back at the years that
have passed since the first inter¬
governmental conference on earth¬
quakes in 1964 and noting the progress
that has been made since then:
establishment of an International
Seismological Centre (in the United.
Kingdom) which uses one of the
world's fastest computers to process
the data coming into it from observ¬
atories all over the world and to
produce its definitive monthly bulletin
of earthquakes;
creation of a Regional Seismolo¬
gical Centre for South America (Lima,
WHEN THE GROUND GAPES UNDERFOOT. Jagged crevasses in a road
at Niigata (Japan) after an earthquake on 16 June 1964. The frequency of
earthquakes in Japan has obliged Japanese architects and engineers to
carry out considerable research into earthquake-resistant construction.
EARTHQUAKES MADE TO MEASURE. Soviet Central Asia is a region of
intense seismic activity. Violent earthquakes destroyed almost all the old
buildings of Ashkhabad, capital of Turkmenistan, in 1948 and those of
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, in. 1966. Earthquake risk was thus an
important factor in plans to rebuild these two cities. Soviet specialists have
developed special "vibrating machines" enabling them to subject buildings
to the equivalent of seismic shocks. Left, technicians set up the vibrating
machine on a rooftop in Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan. At the Research
Institute of Geophysics and Earthquake Engineering in Leninakan, Soviet
Armenia, scientists have established that there exists in certain rocks a
type of magnetization, sensitive to mechanical stress, whose changes
can be used to help forecast earthquakes. The Institute is therefore deve¬
loping the instrumentation required for monitoring these changes.

pecially that resulting from the filling

Many of these achievements de¬
pended of course upon the financial
support received from the United
Nations Development Programme.
Others may be cited, but the point has
been made that progress in this field,
although slower than some might have
wished, has been steady and may be
expected to continue in the future,
despite financial uncertainties.
This is because there ¡s a basic
economic justification for this work.
A single earthquake may cost a
country more than its annual national
budget and may set back its economic
progress by 5 or 10 years. Since 1964,
more than 100,000 human lives have
been claimed by earthquakes and the
damage caused by them throughout
the world must be reckoned in billions
of dollars. The cost of seismological
research, of seismic zoning, of earth¬
quake prediction and even of earth¬
quake-resistant building is small in
comparison.
We now know enough about the
cause of earthquakes, the slow but
inexorable movements of the crust
driven by forces deep within the earth,
to be convinced that these movements
have been going on since our planet
was formed and will probably continue
for thousands of millions of years in
the future. They are part of the "life
process" of the earth by which the
crust is constantly renewed and which,
by the way, is responsible for the
formation of the minerals on which our
present civilization is based.
The instantaneous destruction and
loss of life inflicted by earthquakes
can only be compared with that inflict¬
ed by modern weapons of war. It
seems right, therefore, that Unesco,
which seeks to prevent such human
folly, should equally be concerned
with protecting mankind from nature's
violence.
We have been too long accustomed
to people dying in earthquakes. We
must learn to live with them.

Beyond good and evil : the fabulous dragon
This composite monster with a lion's head, eagle's talons and
serpent's tail is a "tatsu" or Japanese dragon which, accord¬
ing to Japanese legend, makes the earth "quake" when it
bestirs itself. The ancestor of the tatsu was no doubt the
Chinese dragon which, so tradition in China has it, hides in
the caverns of inaccessible mountains or lies coiled in the
ocean depths, waiting for the moment to unite earth and
water, to make rain or fine weather, to herald the spring
with the return of nature's energies and the explosion of
new life. Unlike the malevolent dragon of the West, in East
Asia the dragon is the genius of goodness and strength. It
is the spirit of change, therefore of life itself. At the spring
equinox it ascends to the skies, and in autumn buries itself
in the watery depths. According to the Book of Divination,
Yi King, the dragon's blood is yellow and black, corresponding
to Heaven and Earth respectively. The emblem of vigilance
and security, the dragon guards the treasures of the gods,
carrying out their will as the spirit of order and creation in
the universe. In Chinese chronology, based on a cycle of
60 years, each year is named after a symbolic animal which
reappears every 12 years. This year, 1976, in China is the
year of the Dragon, the fifth animal in the cycle, following
the year of the Hare and preceding the year of the Snake.
From the 2nd century B.C. (Han dynasty) onwards, the
dragon was the emblem of imperial power and the symbol
of the emperor who like the dragon was said to "hold a
brilliant pearl in his mouth". Hence the "dragon pearl" came
to symbolize perfection of thought and word befitting the
leader, and was associated with one of the "eight treasures"
of Chinese symbolism. Photo © Giraudon. Paris

For the first time in history
CHINA PREDICTS A MAJOR
EARTHQUAKE AND SAVES
AN ENTIRE POPULATION
FROM DISASTER
by Dan Behrman
AN international scientific meet¬
ing at Unesco headquarters in
Paris took a dramatic turn recently
when, for the first time in such a sett¬
ing, the story was told of a successful
attempt to predict a major earthquake
and to get an endangered population
out of its way. The report was given
by China to the Unesco Intergovern¬
mental Conference on the Assessment
and Mitigation, of Earthquake Risk, at
a special session devoted to earth¬
quake prediction.
The Chinese delegation, headed by
Liu Ying-yung, director of his country's
State Seismological Bureau, told of
methods used to forecast the Haicheng
earthquake that occurred in Liaoning
Province on 4 February 1975 with a
magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter
scale (1).
The delegation also described Chi¬
na's effort to develop a seismological
network which has been termed "the
equivalent of an Apollo space pro¬
gramme". The genesis of the effort
was traced to the severe earthquake
that Struck Hsingtai in Hopei Province
in 1966 and led the late Premier Chou
En-lai to set a priority on seismology.
China now has 10,000 professional
and 100,000 amateur seismologists in
a network comprising seventeen stan-
DAN BEHRMAN is a Unesco science
writer well known to " Unesco Courier "
readers. He is the author of "The New World
of the Oceans" (Little Brown and Co.. Bos¬
ton, U.S.A.) also published in a paperback
edition, "In Partnership with Nature: Unesco
and the Environment" (Unesco, Paris, 1972)
and "The Man Who Loved Bicycles"

year (by Little Brown and Co.).
dard stations and nearly 300 regional
stations. By enlisting amateur obser¬
vers who include farmers, workers,
teachers, telephone operators, meteo¬
rologists and radio broadcasters the
Chinese have sought to give the
population at large a role and a stake,
to put the citizen on the same side as
the scientist.
From the very start of the pro¬
gramme, Liaoning Province looked sus¬
picious. Following the earthquake at
Hsingtai, seismologists noted that the
epicentre of subsequent smaller shocks
seemed to be migrating northeast
towards Liaoning, heavily populated
and industrialized. In 1970, a decision
was taken to keep a close watch on
the province. This involved all the
techniques in the seismologist's pano¬
ply, starting with the study of past
earthquakes and local geology.
Geodetic surveying across a major
fault between September 1973 and
June 1974 showed that the earth's
surface there was rising twenty times
faster than in a normal year and tilting
towards the northwest. During the
same period, a change was recorded
in the earth's magnetic field and tidal
stations over on the shore of Liaotung
Bay showed a rise in sea level. Finally,
the number of small earthquakes in
1974 was five times higher than
normal.
These findings led the government
to warn the population that a bad
earthquake was in the offing. However,
no one could yet say exactly when it
would occur and other signs were
sought. Among these were changes
in the behaviour of animals.
The Chinese, in their report to the
Unesco conference, told of such ins¬
tances in the past. Two hours before
the Pohai earthquake of 7.4 magnitude
on 18 July 1969, a keeper at the Tient¬
sin zoo noticed that his tigers were
acting strangely and told local seis¬
mologists that "a big earthquake may
be approaching". And in Szechuen
Province in September 1972, a pre¬
diction team announced the onset of
another earthquake after observing
"the panic of chickens, pigs refusing to
enter pigsties, horses and sheep
running about frenziedly..."
The man in the street or on the farm
is considered by the Chinese to be a
valuable source of observations of
changes in animal behaviour or in the
level of ground water.
In December 1974, such changes
were seen and reported in Liaoning.
Wells in four communes suddenly
turned muddy and started to bubble;
rats and mice left their holes; hibern¬
ating snakes slithered out onto the ice.
Then a magnitude 4.8 earthquake
occurred seventy kilometres from
Haicheng, leading authorities to con¬
clude that something more serious was
on the way. The local population had
already been involved in "earthquake
manoeuvres"; now, a campaign began
to teach every household what to do
if an earthquake came.
Though a scientific paper, the Chi¬
nese report is almost a cliff-hanger,
leaving the reader to wonder what will
happen next. Early in February, ani-.-
mais were still acting abnormally and r

ANCESTOR
OF ALL
SEISMOGRAPHS
The Chinese have the double distinction of
having kept faithful records of earth¬
quakes from very early times since 780
B.C. and of inventing the first instrument
capable of detecting them at a distance.
The Chinese ancestor of all seismographs
was produced in 132 A.D. by a famous
mathematician, astronomer and geograph¬
er named Chang Heng (78-139 A.D.). His
instrument was fitted into a large orna:
mented bronze vessel (as ' shown . in
drawing on right and in facsimile, at left,
in the Museum of Geology at Peking)!
From Volume III, "Science and Civilization In China" by
, wells showed disquieting signs.
Twenty-two became artesian; in a
hot-spring resort, the opposite hap¬
pened when the flow of water was cut
off three times. The report stated:
"The most peculiar case took place at
the Shaozihe Commune in Youyan
Country where gas-bearing water
spouted forth from ice like geysers."
The pace of events quickened. On
2 February, an abrupt fall in terrestrial
electricity was recorded at one seis¬
mological station; at another, the tilt
of the earth's surface was seen to
move towards the southwest.
One wonders just what made the
Chinese decide when the earthquake
would strike. Apparently, the last
straw was a series of small earth¬
quakes that began on 1 February in a
region that had been almost non-
seismic previously.
Seismologists studied the location of
these shocks and the direction taken
by their so-called P-waves [seismic
waves that cause rocks in their path
to compress and then expand in the
same direction as the waves are travel¬
ling]. The scientists concluded that
these were the forerunners of a much
larger earthquake likely to hit the
Haicheng-Yingkou region.
The scientists passed their findings
to the local government. An hour and
a half later, a meeting at Haicheng
decided that it was time to move from
earthquake manhuvres to reality.
"Without delay, people were notified
to build temporary huts, to move
patients from hospitals, to concentrate
transportation facilities and important
objects, to organize medical teams, to
persuade people to move out of their
houses, to move the old and weak to
safe places. . ."
At 7:36 p.m. on 4 February 1975,
the Haicheng earthquake came at last.
But, reported the Chinese, loss of life
was greatly reduced because most
people had left their homes. Vehicles
had been moved from garages and
farm animals from barns. "Within
the most destructive area, more than
90 per cent of the houses collapsed
to some extent, but many agricultural
production brigades did not suffer
even a single casualty. In the Ding-
jiagou brigade of Haicheng, consisting
of more than 3,000 persons, only one
child was injured."
On one street in Yingkou, 3,470 per¬
sons came through with no casualties,
although 82 of their 801 homes collap¬
sed completely. "However," said the
report, "in certain communes and
brigades, such as the Shinpengyou
brigade, two commune members, in¬
fluenced by old ideas, did not believe
the prediction of a strong earthquake. .
They brought their children back to
sleep in the evening of 4 February.
As a consequence, among more than
3,400 people in this brigade, three
died in the earthquake".
This led the Chinese to conclude
that if earthquake losses are to be
reduced, one must not only estimate
the danger accurately but, at the same
time, educate those who are at risk,
making certain that the seismologists'
findings do not remain arcane
secrets. There is a human side as well:
"Let seismological work be really
considered as the task of the masses
of the people as well as of the govern¬
mental seismological brigades."
A similar attitude was expressed at
the Unesco conference by Rasnar
Stefansson of the Icelandic Meteoro¬
logical Office who told how an earth-

Drawings below explain how it functioned.
Inside the vessel was a heavy pendulum
connected to eight mobile arms. At the
end of each arm a crank operated the
jaws of a dragon head (eight heads in all).
Earthquake shocks vibrated the mechanism
causing the dragon's jaws facing the
direction of the shock to open, dropping a
ball into the mouth of one of the eight
toads placed around the instrument. The
position of the ball thus indicated the
direction from which the seismic shocks
had originated.

quake swarm had struck the north of
his country near the end of last year.
Within a month, it generated no fewer
than 10,000 earthquakes that could
be felt without instruments, 100 of
them greater than magnitude 4.
On 25 December 1975, he was able
to tell local sheep-raisers that there ;
was no need to fear any more severe
shocks. He emphasized that the
population must be involved: "If you
explain wnat you know and what is
happening, people won't hold it
against you if you make mistakes."
This is all the more important in
China with a great density of popu¬
lation living in seismic zones. It was
in China that the most disastrous
earthquake of all time occurred at
Huahsien in Shensi Province in 1556,
leaving 820,000 dead.
Traditional Chinese houses are
built with heavy roofs that protect
them from the climate but can prove
lethal in an earthquake. Replacing
them with earthquake-resistant hous¬
ing ¡s a long job. Until it can be
done, prediction is the best safeguard.
The Chinese delegation stated that
more than ten earthquakes with a
magnitude greater than five have
been forecast. However, this is only a
"small percentage" of all that occur
because few observations are avail¬
able from remote areas in western
China.
Other countries, notably Japan,
U.S.A. and U.S.S.R., have been con¬
ducting research in earthquake pre¬
diction and reported some of their
findings at the conference. Dr Robert
Hamilton of the U.S. Geological Sur¬
vey told how the San Andreas Fault
in California has been instrumented
with fifty tiltmeters in deep and shal¬
low holes while laser-ranging instru¬
ments sensitive enough to detect one
centimetre of crustal deformation over
ten kilometres have been set up.
The tiltmeters have shown the most
promise. Since November 1974, three
earthquakes of magnitude 4 or greater
on the San Andreas Fault were all
preceded by a tilt anomaly. About a
month before the earthquake, the
instruments start to deflect and keep
on deflecting until it occurs.
"Precursors do exist and prediction
is feasible," Dr Hamilton said, "but
a prediction sufficiently reliable to be
useful to us does not exist." Never¬
theless, it was the policy of the U.S.
Geological Survey to inform the pub¬
lic of what it observes, rather than
withhold information for fear of rai¬
sing an alarm. "We see no alterna¬
tive," said Dr Hamilton.
One should note that stakes are not
the same everywhere. In the United
States, only 1,600 lives have been
lost to earthquakes during the entire
history of the country and the typical
American wooden dwelling can be
expected to ride . out most shocks.
Even so, earthquake prediction in *!
United States is a delicate matter an;,
is likely to be so in any developed
industrial country.
An American study has shown that
property values can be expected to
drop by as much as 60 per cent in
the event of the prediction of a
7.3 magnitude earthquake while cons¬
truction comes to a halt and overall
business activity declines by a quar¬
ter. Such are the problems that are
likely to appear in the not-so-remote
future as the prediction of earthquakes
is fined down to an exact science.

On 8 July 1975 the ancient city of Pagan in Burma was
rocked by an earthquake. Of all the great centres of
Buddhism in Asia few boast such a concentration of
religious edifices as Pagan with its forest of pagodas
and stupas. All told some 5,000 monuments extend
across a site covering over 70 sq. km. In Pagan's
fantastic landscape some stand out glistening white
against their red-brown weatherbeaten neighbours.
A Unesco mission was sent to Pagan in November
1975 to assess the damage to the temples and advise
on urgent restoration work.
PAGAN
'BURMA'S'
ANCIENT CITY
OF 2,000 PAGODAS
DAMAGED BY
A VIOLENT
EARTHQUAKE
by Pierre Pichará
IMAGINE one of the great religious
capitals of the world Rome, Cairo
or Kyoto, for example deserted by
its inhabitants. Imagine that all 'its
dwellings the palaces of the mighty,
the villas of the rich and the homes
of the poorer neighbourhoods had
today completely disappeared, but that
its countless religious edifices were
still standing, with churches, mosques
or temples set in open country,
monasteries encircled by ploughed
PIERRE PICHARD, French architect, was
sent to Burma by Unesco in 1975 to assess
the damage caused by the earthquake in the
ancient city of Pagan and to report on the
restoration needs of its monuments. Bet¬
ween 1969 and 1971 he taught at the
School of Architecture at Nantes (France).
He has also carried out restoration missions
for Unesco at Panom Rung (Thai/and) and
Paharpur (Bangladesh).
fields, and minarets or bell-towers
looking down on farming villages.
This astonishing spectacle you have
conjured up is exactly what we find
today at the site of Pagan, capital of
the first Burmese royal dynasty, a city
which stood on a vast cultivated plain
of the Irrawaddy river, surrounded
with fields of sesame, peanuts and
corn, and villages set among clusters
of trees.
Dwellings, markets and palaces,
built of wood and bamboo, have been
effaced by the centuries. The only
remaining trace of secular architecture
is the wall around the ancient city,
said to have been erected by King
Pyinbya in the ninth century A.D.
Here are more than 2,500 religious
edifices of all shapes and sizes, some
assembled in great constellations,
others in small groups and others
again standing in isolation. All these
monuments within an area just under
80 square km are cared for by Burma's
Department of Archaeology which has
carried out an inventory of all the
remains. Monuments at Pagan total
some 5,000 if all the archaeological
vestiges are included.
Pagan has two main types of
monument:
Stupas or pagodas, masonry con¬
structions enclosing some venerated
relic. They frequently stand upon
several terraces arranged in tiers, and
are reached by flights of steps on
each facade. The main structure,
generally circular in plan, suggests an
enormous bell surmounted by a deli¬
cately wrought flower-shaped metal
ornament.
The Shwezigon pagoda is the most
famous and attracts numerous pilgrims,
especially during festivals, occasions
when traditional theatrical perform-

anees, music and dancing take place,
and great» markets are held. The
offerings of the pilgrims help to
maintain the gold-leaf coating, period¬
ically renewed over the entire surface
of the edifice.
Temples, known in Burmese as
gu or "grottoes" are the second type
of monument. The name is clearly an
allusion to the ancient temple-caves
of Buddhist India, but also indicates
how they differ from the stupas, for
what counts here is the space left
inside for people to walk around the
statues of Buddha.
The main structure is usually shaped
like a cube surmounted by tiered
terraces, crowned either with a tower
known as a "sikhara" or with a
masonry bell resembling a stupa.
Rising overhead is the summit orna¬
ment with its slender spire. At the
terrace corners,' where the steps lead
off, there are turrets, urns or small
stupas.
The tallest temple in Pagan, the
Thatbyinnyu, is 64 metres high, the
height of a 20-storey building, and
comprises corridors on four levels, a
wide vestibule, a vast sanctuary, and
terraces.
In addition to the temples and
stupas, there exist numerous mon¬
asteries, other partly underground
edifices (temples or monasteries),
vaulted rectangular rooms known as
"ordination halls", subsidiary structures
such as walled enclosures and gate-
lodges, and some ornamental pools,
reservoirs and canals.
! The decoration inside the temples is
mostly the work of painters. The
paintings, in vivid colours (often dulled
by time but which careful cleaning
restores) cover the walls and the
vaults, either as great panels in broad
compositions featuring numbers of
human figures, or as small groups
of individual scenes, frequently ac¬
companied by inscriptions not unlike
modern comic strips.
These scenes illustrate the ¡atakas,
tales of the former lives of Buddha.
Colour is enhanced by outline drawing
felicitously emphasizing expressions
on faces, details of clothing or
objects, attitudes of animals, as well
as depicting decorative plant motifs.
Sculptors have also left their mark:
imposing statues of Buddha, smaller
statues placed in the many niches, or,
at the Nanpaya temple, four stone
pillars decorated with extremely beauti¬
ful sculpture carved in low relief.
Although numerous legends attribute
very great antiquity to the city of
Pagan and suggest that the royal
dynasty was founded about 108 A.D.,

, dence provide a more scientific basis
for a history of Pagan beginning
with the reign of Anawrahta (1044-
1077 A.D.). And although several
archaeological finds have revealed that
the site has been occupied since
neolithic times, the oldest monuments
of Pagan would appear to date from no
earlier than the eleventh century A.D.
Anawrahta is said to have conquered
the Mon kingdom of Thaton (in the
south-central part of present-day
Burma) in 1057, and to have brought
to Pagan Thaton's captive king, arti¬
sans, workmen, architects and scholars,
as well as the sacred texts of Thera-
vada Buddhism, the religion of Burma
down to the present day.
The kingdom of Pagan extended
almost to the frontiers of modern
Burma, and was to last for two
hundred and fifty years: it collapsed
before the Mongol armies of Kublai
Khan, then master of China, which
took Pagan in 1287 A.D. The Peking
court thereupon broke up the kingdom
into small rival principalities, and the
last kings of Pagan were rulers in
name only. It was from other capitals
such as Toungoo, Ava, Pegu and
Mandalay, that later Burmese dynasties
succeeded in restoring the unity of
the kingdom.
However, the city was never com¬
pletely abandoned. Paintings in the
underground temple of Kyanzittha
Umin feature Mongol soldiers, showing
that work continued under their
occupation. Even later, a few monu¬
ments were constructed, and others
decorated, right down to the eighteenth
century. The most celebrated sanc¬
tuaries have been cared for by monks
from neighbouring monasteries until
our own times.
ON 8 July 1975, this unique site
was rocked by an earthquake.
An initial series of vertical tremors at
6:35 in the evening was followed by a
few seconds of calm, and then
horizontal movements in a northeast-
southwest direction. Amid the din of
collapsing masonry, monuments dis¬
appeared in enormous . red clouds
which slowly deposited the dust of
crushed mortar and bricks.
Staff from the Department of
Archaeology set out as night was
falling to assess the damage and for
several days despatched to the capital
a growing list of damaged monuments.
Fortunately, however, the earthquake
had claimed no victims.
The tremor reached an intensity of
8 on the international scale (graduated
from 1 to 12), and its magnitude on
the Richter scale was estimated at 5.6.
The epicentre seems to have been
quite close. The tremor was more
intense around the modern village of
Pagan and along the river, where
numerous monuments were heavily
damaged, and less so towards the
southeast.
The extent of the damage thus varies
widely from one monument to another.
Several factors may have either
produced a combined effect or can¬
celled one another out. These include
the site of the building, its mass, its
architecture, the details of its con¬
struction and its state of preservation.
Although several monuments col¬
lapsed entirely, it was generally only
the upper parts which suffered, in
varying degrees. The vaults of the
temples of Manuha and Mimalaung
Kyaung, the upper storey of Guni
North and of several other temples,
collapsed into the halls or corridors.
Elsewhere, damage was limited to the
superstructures: steeples of stupas and
sikharas, turrets, terrace walls, etc.
In general, and though spectacular,
this damage has not jeopardized the
stability of these monuments, and
except in rare cases the work of
restoration can be progressively under¬
taken without any difficult problems.
More serious is the structural
damage affecting the upper part of
the walls and the vaults which they
support. Deep crevices reveal move¬
ments of inclination and subsidence
which may be intensified by the thrust
of the vaults.
These shaken monuments have been
more or less stabilized for the time
being, but are still in a dangerous
condition, and major work will be
required to ensure their survival:
insertion of reinforced-concrete ties
and countervaults, interior lining of
terrace walls, etc.
The only irreparable damage was to
the decorations: sculptured plaster that
fell from outside surfaces and painted
plaster fallen from the inside. In most
cases, the fragments shattered upon
striking the ground and cannot be
pieced together. A few monuments
lost half of their paintings in this way,
but more frequently the loss amounts
to 10 to 20 per cent of what existed
before the earthquake. Parts still in
place, but in some cases loosened,
could fall at any moment.
Pagan had already experienced
several earthquakes: Burma is situated
in the so-called "trans-Asiatic" seismic
zone extending from the Mediterranean
to Indonesia. More than 400 earth¬
quakes were recorded in Burma
between 1904 and 1975, including 32
of a magnitude greater than 6. Though
Pagan is located west of the most
exposed region (the north-south Pegu-
Mandalay fault) it suffered shocks and
damage in 1948, 1965 and 1967, and
five slight tremors were reported
between 1968 and 1975.
Several ancient inscriptions found
on monuments refer to restorations
following a seismic disturbance, and
a history of Burma, written by a
minister, Twin Thin, relates that under
the reign of Narapatisithu (1174-1211),
an earthquake "ravaged the temples,
monasteries and pagodas, from the
southwest corner of the royal palace
to the jetty of Let-Pan, and covered the
ground with a network of crevices."
Hence the earthquake occurred
during construction of the monuments,
and was doubtless not the only one.
This explains the great care taken with
the foundations (which have never
budged down to present times) and
with the construction in general: well-
baked bricks scrupulously assembled
(at least on the facings), thick walls
reinforced at critical points with cross-
pieces or foundations of stone, vaults
of carefully bonded brick, all of which
prevented much more serious damage
and make it possible to undertake the
work of restoration under the most
favourable conditions.
However, the job is sure to be long,
tricky and costly. In particular, earth¬
quakes must be regarded as a per¬
manent threat, and the work must be
capable of safeguarding structures
from at least force-8 tremors on the
international scale.
The great number of badly shaken
monuments will require several work¬
sites to be operating at the same time
and an order of priority to be estab¬
lished for restoration work. The
Burmese authorities and people realize
the size of the job and are resolved
to devote a major effort to it.
IMMEDIATELY after the catastro¬
phe, effective temporary measures
were taken: tarpaulins were installed
on frames and terraces repaired to
protect the monuments during the rainy
season, and in numerous cases this
preserved interior paintings and pre¬
vented further collapsing: scaffoldings
have been erected and damage surveys
prepared. Removal of debris and
cleaning up were quickly done, with
the aid of numerous youth movement
volunteers from all over Burma.
Collections among the Burmese
people have raised three million kyatts
(approximately U.S. $480,000), and this
sum is still intact, since the initial
work was financed out of government
emergency funds. An Advisory Board
was set up to co-ordinate the action
of several government departments
and of engineers from the Rangoon
Institute of Technology.
However, a job of such magnitude
and urgency is an enormous one for
a country to undertake alone, and it
is to be hoped that international aid
will be organized. The qualified work¬
force already available at Pagan and
Rangoon will have to be increased
and trained in new techniques of
restoration and consolidation.
But the lack of foreign currency
makes it very difficult for Burma to
purchase the minimum equipment
required to cope with this urgent task.
An initial calculation has estimated the
cost of needed equipment (cranes,
trucks, concrete-mixers, drawing, sur¬
veying and worksite equipment, etc.)
at around U.S. $900,000. Numerous
countries and cultural institutions
should be ready to share in such
a worthwhile enterprise.

Glittering against the skyline, Ananda pagoda is one of the most famous and
best-preserved of the temples of Pagan (above). Completed in the 11th century, its
plan may have been inspired by the great cave-temples of India. Damaged in the .
earthquake of July 1975, Ananda figured on the list of monuments for priority
restoration drawn up by the Burmese authorities. Photos below show aspects of
restoration work being carried out on Pagan's major edifices. Note the dense

THE COMING EARTHQUAKE
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Scientists are certain that a major earthquake
will occur in the San Francisco Bay area
The only question is when will it happen
by Karl V. Steinbrugge
A major earthquake will strike
the San Francisco Bay Area.
The only question is when will it
strike. But if disaster is thereby im¬
plied, then why is the San Francisco
area allowed to grow? The answer lies
in the plans and actions which have
and are being taken to reduce the
seismic hazards to acceptable levels
of risk.
Earthquakes cannot yet be predic¬
ted with accuracy as to time, place,
and severity but progress is being
KARL V. STEINBRUGGE is perhaps
America's leading expert on designing earth¬
quake-resistant buildings. He is chairman of
the U.S. National Committee of the inter¬
national Association of Earthquake Engi¬
neering and chairman of the Seismic Safety
Commission ol the State ol California. Since
1950 he has been professor of structural
design at the Department of Architecture,
University of California, Berkeley.
made in this direction (see article
page 11). The San Francisco Bay Area
has been chosen as a major study for
experimenting with earthquake predic¬
tion techniques for several reasons,
including its potential for having many
earthquakes in the near future and
thereby allowing the testing of theories.
A glance at the comparatively brief
historic record of this region of Cali¬
fornia shows that destructive earth¬
quakes have been frequent. Five major
earthquakes have struck the area
in the two centuries which comprise
its historic record. The great 1906 San
Francisco earthquake had surface
faulting [fractures in the earth's crust]
which extended for over 400 kilometres
apart as much as 7 metres.
However, the other four earlier
earthquakes were also very strong.
These five major earthquakes have
occurred on two well-known geo¬
logically active faults. The greater of
these two faults (the San Andreas)
goes through the San Francisco area
and runs very close to Los Angeles; it
has often been termed California's
"Master Fault".
Geologic studies show that many
major earthquakes have occurred on
this fault over the past millions of
years, and there is no reason to
believe that earthquakes on it will
suddenly cease now. Indeed, precise
surveys conducted for over a century
across the San Andreas fault show
that the islands offshore from San
Francisco are moving northwesterly at
the rate of 5 centimetres per year with
respect to the continent. This consti¬
tutes substantive evidence that strains
are increasing in the earth's crust and
are leading to an earthquake.
A second line of evidence is the
fact that the San Andreas fault is
slowly "creeping". By creeping is
meant that the land masses on one .
side of the fault are moving with r

CALIFORNIA SPLIT. Right, the San Andreas Fault, a major fracture of the earth's crust, comprising
a system of faults extending northwestwards from the Gulf of California for nearly 1,000
kilometres. The break separates a northward moving wedge of California from the rest of North
America. It goes through the San Francisco area and is very close to Los Angeles. Its movement
has been responsible for frequent earthquakes, including the great 1906 San Francisco quake
(see photo page 22). Above, outline of the Fault is clearly visible in this high altitude view of

CITY IN FLAMES. This striking viewof San Francisco in flames was taken
five hours after the great earthquake of 18 April 1906. Fires raged for
three days because water mains had been destroyed and many buildings which survived
the quake were gutted as flames swept through nearly 500 city blocks.
Towns and villages along a 300 kilometre section of the earthquake-prone
San Andreas fault also suffered heavily from the same quake.
respect to the other side, but moving
so slowly that only instruments can
record these displacements.
This creep is not associated with
recorded earthquakes, but is an evi¬
dence of strains within the earth's
crust. The most prominent example
is a winery south of San Francisco
and on the San Andreas fault which
has been in the process of being torn
apart at the rate of over 1 centimetre
per year for at least the past 50 years.
Certainly, the historic record plus
the geologic settings are strong indi¬
cations that the San Francisco area
will experience a major earthquake
from the notorious San Andreas fault.
On the other hand, there exists the
potentially more dangerous Hayward
fault which goes through major popu¬
lation areas within the suburbs of
San Francisco. The Hayward fault has
had major earthquakes on it and fault
creep is taking place on it.
It is easy to conclude, therefore,
that a major earthquake is a reason¬
able probability in the foreseeable fu¬
ture. It is understandable why scien¬
tists are using this area as the first
major testing ground for earthquake
prediction research.
Earthquakes, in themselves, are not
a significant hazard. The documented
cases of a fault opening up and en¬
compassing people and then burying
them can, perhaps, be counted on
one's fingers. Landslides can, and
do, take a very significant toll of lives,
but in most cases these hazards are
relatively self-evident before the earth¬
quake and do not need an earthquake
to trigger them. The major life
hazard in the usual earthquake is from
the collapse of man-made structures
such as buildings and dams. This is
certainly true for all of California as
well as San Francisco.
The solution to seismic hazards is
to design and construct buildings in
such a manner that they will remain
safe during and after an earthquake,
with damage limited to acceptable
economic and functional levels. Idea¬
lly, then, an earthquake would become
an exciting experience, but not a
hazardous adventure.
However, tearing down all existing
construction and replacing it with
earthquake resistant construction has
overwhelming limitations. Financial and
material resources simply do not exist,
technologies are inadequate for some
cases, and only over time can these
hazardous buildings be replaced.
As a result, disaster response offi¬
cials in government and in the private
sector must evaluate what can be
reasonably expected to occur since
the hazards will remain. The United
States government has completed four
such studies for areas in which earth
quakes are likely to occur and where
their occurrence would be disastrous.
Earthquake loss studies for disas¬
ter preparedness should consider the
problems from three standpoints:
Effects on local medical resources:
This includes damage to hospitals,
medical supplies at hospitals and else¬
where, bloodbanks, structures housing
ambulances, and the like.
Demands on local medical resour¬
ces: Planners must know what to ex¬
pect as a reasonable upper limit to
the number of deaths and injured,
weigh these figures against the losses
to medical resources, and plan for the
needs that must be supplied from dis¬
tant sources.
Effects on immediate and vital pub¬
lic needs: Estimates must be made
of probable damage and its location
in relation to water supplies and sys¬
tems, electric power, transportation,
and the other items which constitute
a community's "lifelines". Provision
must be made to care for those made
homeless from damage to dwellings,
from fire following earthquake, from
evacuation due to damage to or failure
of dams, etc.
Time of day may be important in
evaluating hazard. In California, for
example, most persons will be in their
quite safe wood frame dwellings at
2:30 a.m., but many of these persons

will be in significantly more hazardous
structures during the working day.
The season of the year is also impor¬
tant, since landsliding is much more
likely during the wet season than du¬
ring the dry season, while conflagra¬
tion is much more likely in the reverse
order.
The San Andreas fault is associa¬
ted with the largest potential life loss.
However, the nearby Hayward fault
has the largest potential to disrupt
disaster recovery, since many of San
Francisco Bay Area's "lifelines" must
cross this fault and thereby be expo¬
sed to rupture.
For example, major water aqueducts
cross the Hayward fault in deep tu'n-
, neis which cannot. be. readily. repaired,,
and the water distribution system
-4'criss-crosses-the: fault.- Highway-and-
/freeway bridges are located in the
' fault zone. Oil lines,' natural gas lines,
' underground telephone cables, etc.
frequently cross the fault.
A total of 10,000 deaths in the San
Francisco area has been established
as an upper limit for disaster planning
purposes. This possible loss of life
is horrendous, but it represents less
than 1/4 of one per cent of the affec¬
ted population. Fortunately, steps have
been and are being taken to reduce
this potential loss of life.
The 1971 San Fernando, California
earthquake showed the need for Fe¬
deral Government studies. Currently,
active and detailed disaster response
planning to these Federal studies is
proceeding at all governmental levels
and in the private sector. This planning
will substantially reduce the time need
ed to restore the cities to normal,
will minimize suffering, and will reduce
most of the adverse effects of a great
earthquake.
. Response to seismic hazards and to
disaster may be post-disaster oriented
as mentioned above but it may also
be pre-disaster oriented. While post-
disaster response is absolutely vital,
it is pre-disaster response which has
the greatest promise.
At local government level, the city
of San Francisco is emulating the long
established Los Angeles policy of
removing or bracing all hazardous
non-reinforced brick parapets and
appendages. Worldwide earthquake
experience clearly shows that these
hazards are serious even Jn moderate .
shocks.
At California state level, numerous
legislative matters were acted..upon
and became' law after the 1971 San
Fernando earthquake. The details of
these laws need not be reviewed here,
but the following are, in the author's
view, the most significant changes ¡n
public policy at California state level:
The concept that certain facilities
vital to the public must remain func¬
tional in addition to being safe. Re¬
cently enacted law is concerned with
new hospitals, and other legislation is
being considered for other types of
installations. Certainly, damage control
is a new dimension insofar as Califor¬
nia earthquake building regulations
are concerned.
The implication in law that perfect
seismic safety does not exist. The
mandatory preparation of inundation
maps of areas' below dams clearly
implies that risk exists, but also im¬
plies that public policy deems the areas
to be within acceptable risk levels.
Construction in earthquake geolo¬
gically-hazardous areas is acceptable,
provided sufficient engineering design
and construction precautions are taken
to reduce the hazards to acceptable
risk levels. Thus, one may build
within fault zones under specified cir¬
cumstances which largely eliminate
the hazards to life.
Seismic safety public policy is great¬
ly influenced by events over which
people have no control. The 1971 San
Fernando earthquake stimulated exis¬
ting programmes and led to new and
improved policies. But from past
experience/only too often the rate of
-hazard, reduction, de£ceajses~wit!i..t[me_
after the disaster.
. On the £>ther hand, the State of Cali¬
fornia created a Seismic Safety Com¬
mission which is to study public
policy and to report directly to the
Legislature and to the Governor. This
Commission, therefore, has the poten¬
tial to insure continued progress. It
has been in existence for less than a
year and understandably there exist
no major accomplishments to measure
its success. But it could be followed
with careful attention as a possible
model to be used elsewhere.
The remaining earthquake hazards
in the San Francisco Bay Area will,
in time, be reduced to acceptable risk
levels, but not until the numerous older
non-earthquake resistant buildings are
removed.

DAMS THAT TRIGGER OFF
EARTHQUAKES
Lakes used as reservoirs seen in this
photo of a section of the U.S. Pacific
coastline, are formed by subsidences
along the San Andreas Fault in Cali¬
fornia. Here seismic activity has helped
man to solve the problem of water
storage. Elsewhere many cases are
known where dam construction and
other engineering works have actu¬
ally triggered off earthquakes. Such
"induced seismicity", also caused by
mining and the injection of water and
liquid wastes deep underground, was
studied at the first international sym¬
posium to be held on this problem, in
Banff (Canada) in September 1975.
More recently (at Unesco's February
1976 conference on the assessment and
mitigation of earthquake risk) a Cana¬
dian geophysicist, D.I. Gough, reported
that 20 cases are known of increases in
seismic activity related to the filling
of large reservoirs. These range from
micro-earthquakes, detectable only
with sensitive seismographs, to a
major quake which would have dlused
heavy casualties if it had occurred in a
denselypopulated area. "Known cases"
he stated, "suggest that significant
seismic activity may occur near a
reservoir if the dam height is more
than 100 metres and the water volume
more than 1 billion cubic metres... As
there are now more than 275 reservoirs
with dam heights of over 100 M, the
probability that a given projected
reservoir will cause earthquakes is at
least 1 in 14... As some 135 large
reservoirs are now under construction
or proposed, 10 to 15 new cases of
reservoir-induced seismicity may be
expected in the next few years."

EARTHQUAKES
IN HISTORY
by Nicholas N. Ambraseys
EARTHQUAKES are the result of
very alow geological processes
and we need a very long period of
observation before we can deduce the
laws that govern them.
In spite of the" large amount of data
for earthquakes in this century, the
period of observation'^ tod short. To
increase this period one has to resort
NICHOLAS N. AMBRASEYS, protessor
at the University of London, is head ol the
Engineering Seismology Section of the

He has taken part in and led Unesco

countries, including Turkey, Iran, Yugoslavia,
Pakistan, Nicaragua and Greece, and to Afri¬

Since 1960 he has been a director of the

to the study of earthquakes that took
place before this century and to
choose regions which have a long and
well-recorded history.
One area of the globe which has a
very long and well-doijumented his^
tory is , China. Scientists in that
country,-' studying reliable historical -
records over the past three millennia,
have recently made significant pro¬
gress in evaluating earthquake risk
and in predicting regions in China
where earthquakes are likely, to be
destructive (see article page 11). .
In the western hemisphere, another
region which has a long and well-
documented history is the area1
between Italy and Afghanistan. This
is currently under study at Imperial
College, London, with the object of
extracting from old documents such
information about early events that
could throw some light on the mech
anisms that produce earthquakes, on
the manner in which such events
migrate and, in general, on the evalu¬
ation of the earthquake risk in this
part of the world. (
"".The basic data ' for this study " is
retrieved from published and un¬
published 'documents, -local' "histories
and inscriptions written in Greek, Latin,
Syriac, Persian, Arabic, Slavonic,
Georgian and Turkish, as well as from
the field study of early, earthquake
sites. This is a long-term interdisci¬
plinary project, originally supported by
Unesco and subsequently by the
Natural Environment Research Coun¬
cil, London.
In these studies archaeological evi¬
dence is very important, particularly in
regions for which written evidence is

earthquakes. The issue of new coin¬
age and the establishment of new
mints were often measures taken by
the authorities to relieve regions after
disastrous earthquakes.
Inscriptions recording public assist¬
ance and private generosity for the
reconstruction of destroyed towns are
equally valuable. Abrupt, changes in
building materials and methods of
construction as well as the relocation
of settlements are all useful in assess¬
ing the relative importance of early
earthquakes.
Other factors have also to be taken
into consideration. Among these are
population density; uniformity and
concordance of source material; natu¬
ral exaggeration in the description of
early earthquakes; and the varying
attitudes of historians and poets
throughout the ages to phenomena
such as earthquakes, which reflect the
importance they attach to the events
they are. recording.
One of the major aspects of the
research is the identification of large
earthquakes and the rate at which they
have been occurring during the last
2,000 years. Another is the assess¬
ment of their economic and social
impact on the people in the region
and their effect on the environment.
Search for large earthquakes is not
limited to the most populous centres.
It is usually possible to determine that
an earthquake felt in large towns,
where it may be well documented, was
felt even. more severely and destruc¬
tively in outlying, less cultivated areas
nearer to the true epicentre, where
some cloistered sage may have referr¬
ed to it* in the course of a voluminous
history of his sect or township, or in
a panegyric on his local ruler.
Large earthquakes can be identified
from the size of the area over which
they were felt, the duration of their
aftershocks, the degree of damage
wrought in the centre of the earth¬
quake area and from the economic
and social impact they have on those
involved.
There is little doubt about the size
of the earthquake of 21 July 365 A.D.
which affected an area of about two
million square kilometres in the
Eastern Mediterranean, between Italy
and Palestine, and Greece and North
Africa. This earthquake, one of a

Seismic whiplash
Earthquake shocks subject man-made structures to horizontal forces
that most of them are not designed to withstand. Though these
forces do not always totally demolish buildings, their "whiplash"
effect can result in freakish forms of damage particularly as shown
in photos 2 and 3.
1) During an earthquake at Dasht-e-Bayaz (eastern Iran) that caused
12,000 deaths in 1968, brick and adobe buildings collapsed into
rubble, whereas "windshafts", rooftop kiosques providing ventilation,
remained intact.
.2) Spire of the Mustapha Pasha mosque after the earthquake of
July 1963 in Skopje (Yugoslavia). Its tip has been knocked so far
sideways that the minaret seems to defy the laws of equilibrium.
The more flexible upper part of the spire reacted to the violent
accelerations with a "whiplash" effect, the base of the minaret
acting as the whip's handle.
3) Another example of the same effect is seen in the sections of this
Doric column, dislocated by an earthquake long ago. The column
supports the capital of an ancient Greek temple in Athens, dedicated
to Hephaestus, god of fire and blacksmiths.
4) Railway lines are buckled and twisted as if made of plasticine
in this photo taken after the 1964 earthquake at Niigata (Japan).
Four trains in the area were able to stop in time. Their 500 passengers
were obliged to spend the night in the carriages but escaped from
their terrifying experience unharmed.

a catastrophic sea-wave which in
Alexandria alone drowned 5,000 people.
Evidence of the social impact this
earthquake had is found in the church
calendar. For two centuries the event
was commemorated in- Egypt and
Greece by a yearly festival meant to
appease the sea and arrest the waves,
which in 365 A.D. carried boats over
the walls of towns and deposited them
on roof-tops, drowning thousands 'Of
people.
Recent archaeological evidence has
shown the effects of the 365 A.D.
disaster which marked the end of a
number of declining towns in Libya
and Sicily. Hoards of coins found on
the floor of public buildings trapped
by the tumbled down masses of mason¬
ry pre-date the disaster and testify to
the abandonment of these sites.
Evidence of catastrophic earth¬
quakes abounds in areas which today
appear to be free from earthquakes.
North-Central Iran is a typical example.
During the last two millennia, sites
such as Shahr-Reyy, today a suburb of
Tehran, Qumis near modern Semnan,
Nishapur and Juvain not far from
Mashhad, and other places in Kho-
rassan, were totally destroyed and
abandoned.

for its earthquakes even during the
time of Alexander the Great and the
Greek name of the locality "Rhagae"
meant a place "rent in an earthquake".
Elsewhere, destructive earthquakes in
Baluchistan and Oman, in Lebanon and
Western Syria as well as near Kabul
and Rawalpindi are known, to have
caused widespread damage.
In many instances, particularly in the
western part of the area being studied,
official documents of the late Roman
and Byzantine periods give lists of
towns, that after destructive earth¬
quakes received financial assistance
from the government, as well as
remission of all contributions to the
exchequer for a number of years to
help their reconstruction. These lists
make it possible today to assess the
extent of the area affected by early
earthquakes.
The earliest written evidence re¬
questing such action was actually
found in tablets from Northern Iraq,
dating back to the later part of the
second millenium B.C. This particular
request came from an ill-defined region
north of Mosul, which today is con¬
sidered to be almost free from large
earthquakes. Similar second millen¬
nium B.C. notices have been found
referring to the inability of the local
rulers to pay tribute after destructive
earthquakes on the Mediterranean
coasts and in Syria.
During our research we have found
that deterioration of the local coinage,
taken together with other evidence is
a good indication of the damaging
effects of ancient earthquakes. This
was the case, for instance, in the
25 A.D. earthquake which destroyed
Taxila, in Northern Pakistan, very near
modern Islamabad. The earthquake
destroyed the mint and apparently kill¬
ed its engravers. Similar cases have
been found for Rhodes, Cyprus and
Western Anatolia.
After the Taxila earthquake, houses
were rebuilt stronger, with special
precautions to make their foundations
secure. In some cases these were
carried down as much as five metres,
a drastic change in building techniques
noticed also elsewhere, notably in
Western and Southern Anatolia and
Syria, where after destructive earth¬
quakes builders reduced the height
of new houses from three to one or
two storeys and the lower storey was
left half buried beneath the fallen
debris, and thus constituted a sort
of basement.
After destructive earthquakes, towns
were often rebuilt on an extensive
plan with marked changes in building
techniques such as unusual types of
foundations, consisting of a grid of
wooden beams on which the struc¬
tures are built, the introduction of
timber-bracing of houses and the
abandonment of ordinary unreinfor-
ced brickwork. It is often assumed
that these changes are due to tech¬
niques brought into the region by new
settlers, or by invaders. This is not
always the case.
The acknowledged advantages of
timber-braced constructions in regions
subject to earthquakes have condi¬
tioned building methods, for instance
in Anatolia, Crete, Northern Pakistan
and elsewhere, up to quite recent
times, and historical as well as ar¬
chaeological evidence shows that even
in antiquity such a device was inten¬
ded to give to a building that resilience
which would increase its resistance to.
earthquakes, although it would de¬
crease its fire resistance.
What puzzles archaeologists is the
use of timber-bracing as a building
technique in areas situated outside
the regions where earthquakes are
most prevalent today. This, however
can be explained.
Studies of areas that have been
damaged or devastated repeatedly by
earthquakes during the first 17 centu¬
ries A.D. reveal quite clearly that his-
torical earthquakes follow not only a ^

well defined partem but also that this
pattern in places fits surprisingly well
that of earthquakes that occurred du¬
ring this century.
However, studies also show the
occurrence of quakes in regions which
today are thought to be free from
large earthquakes, such as the Dead
Sea, southeast Turkey and northern
Syria and Iraq, the central Balkans
and eastern Iran. Study shows that
zones which were notorious for their
destructive earthquakes, such as those
in northern Syria and Iraq or east-
central Iran, are quiescent today, while
zones which are active today, such as
Anatolia and the Zagros, were free
from large earthquakes two genera¬
tions ago.
Individual zones may undergo long
periods of activity followed by equa¬
lly long periods of inactivity, lasting
many generations, during which pre¬
cautionary measures against earth¬
quakes in building houses are gra¬
dually abandoned only to be taken up
again a few hundred years later. As
was said earlier, the human time-scale
is minutely short when compared with
the time-scale involved in the geolo¬
gical processes leading to quakes.
EARLY and modern history shows
that the lasting effects of single
major earthquakes during the past
twenty-five centuries would not seem
to have been very significant for a
developed and stable community.
Soon after a large earthquake, vested
interests invariably led people and
their leaders to act once again with
disregard for the prospect of future
such calamities.
Yet modern writers have attempted
to use earthquakes to account for gaps
in the sequence of civilizations and
for large movements of peoples, hypo¬
theses for which there is little histori¬
cal justification. Earthquakes have had
little, if any, serious influence on major
or global historical developments.
They did often account for the prema¬
ture decline of a local economy or for
a crisis in local human affairs. But
they have never caused the ruin of a
culturally advanced state, far less the
end of a civilization.
In contrast with wars, epidemics
and other long-lasting calamities,
earthquakes, no matter how large,
seem to have had little long-term im¬
pact on Man. Personal, political, reli¬
gious and in particular economic inte¬
rests seem to overshadow the lessons
to be learnt from earthquakes.
Take for example, Antiochia, modern
Antakya in Turkey. Since its founda¬
tion the city, built partly on very soft
ground, had suffered from earthquakes.
In 115 A.D. the city was almost totally
destroyed, but because of its strategic
position was rebuilt on the same site.
In 458 A.D., Antiochia was almost tota¬
lly destroyed by another earthquake
and rebuilt on the same spot although
it was pointed out to those concerned
that reconstruction on the same site
was likely to be unwise.
The part of the city on the worst
ground, on the river, being settled by
merchants, was of course rebuilt, only
to be totally destroyed a generation
later with a loss of 200,000 lives. An¬
tiochia was again rebuilt on the same
site, this time becoming an important
religious centre, and was finally
destroyed in 540 A.D. by the Persians.
The economic effects that an earth¬
quake may have on a developing
country or on a poor community are
more important and they can lead to
serious and often uncontrollable di¬
sasters, far more important than the
immediate destructive effects of an
earthquake. The damage and sudden
crippling of an unstable economy may
lead to population movements, to a
latent emigration of skilled people,
increase in taxation and to undesira¬
ble, though unavoidable, loans from
foreign countries which may lead to
economic and social consequences.
For instance, as early as in the
5th century B.C. an earthquake in
Sparta gave the opportunity to the
subject helots to shake off the yoke
of their Spartan masters. In 978 A.D.
an earthquake marked the end of Siraf,
a declining port on the Persian Gulf.
In 1139 A.D., Gandja, the former Eli-
zavetpol, now Kirovabad, was des¬
troyed by an earthquake in which more
than 100,000 people perished; this
gave a chance to the Georgians to
sack the ruined city.
The earthquakes of 1157 in Syria
caused great damage, killing thousands
of people. They brought about a tem¬
porary peace between Moslems and
Crusaders who were too busy repair¬
ing shattered forts to think of serious
aggressive expeditions for some time
to come; these earthquakes caused
little change to the final outcome of
the crusades.
An earthquake in 1320 destroyed
completely Ani, the capital of the Ar¬
menian province of Ararat, causing
its inhabitants to disperse into various
parts of the world, as far as Poland
and Iran. The real cause for the deser¬
tion of the ruined city, however, was
the decadence of the Mongol dynasty
of Armenia.
In 1755, the Lisbon earthquake, on
the other hand, provided an opportu¬
nity for the rebuilding of the city on a
grand scale and also for reducing the
trading privileges of foreigners, thus
stimulating an already active economy.
At the present level of technology,
earthquakes cannot be prevented. Nor
for some years to come will it be
possible to predict them in the detail
required to safeguard the economy of
a developing country.
Earthquake prediction was a cons¬
tant preoccupation for the early sooth¬
sayer, astrologer or prophet, and there
are many instances recorded in his¬
tory of destructive earthquakes having
been forecasted. Earthquake predic¬
tion is also increasingly preoccupying
the modern seismologist. Even when
accurate, such predictions are not
particularly effective, since people
seem strangely reluctant to believe
that an earthquake will occur whether
it is a credited astrologer or a seismo¬
logist who tells them so.
History is full of such examples,
demonstrating that Man reacts to an
inevitable hazard in a special way,
distinct from a preventable hazard.
The earthquake of 1042 A.D. in Tabriz,
in Iran, was predicted by the chief
astrologer, who tried in vain to per¬
suade the people to leave. Earthquakes
had happened in Tabriz sufficiently
frequently to be likely to occur again,
yet the main reaction to the predic¬
tion was one of apathy. The earth¬
quake happened and more than 40,000
people perished. Subsequent pre¬
dictions, allegedly accurate, were in¬
variably ignored.
The earthquake of 1549 in eastern
Iran was also predicted by the Cadi
[judge] of that place who tried unsuc¬
cessfully to convince his people to
stay out in the open that particular
night. They refused to listen and
the Cadi stayed out alone, but finding
the night very cold returned to his
house where he soon perished with
3,000 people in the district. Apparen¬
tly, the Cadi himself was not too sure
about his prediction.
Our research shows that with earth¬
quakes it is not only the prediction and
warning problems that are important
but also the social and economic im¬
plications of forecasting such disas¬
ters. False alarms and inaccurate ti¬
ming might create more problems than
already exist.
TODAY, earthquake prediction
would be welcomed by scientists
and engineers, but for the general
public it is not certain whether this
would solve more problems than the
social, economic and even political
ones that it must create.
There is no denying that there is
at present a lack of knowledge of facts
regarding earthquake risk in many
parts of the world and that it is through
the study of the historical record that
such facts may become known. In
spite of the recent rapprochement
between archaeologists, historians and
earth scientists, a proper link for the
study of subjects of mutual interest
such as early earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, weather changes, droughts
and floods, has not been formed.
Work on these subjects is being
pursued singly and with little co-ope¬
ration or guidance from other fields of
knowledge, a process which is not
only painfully slow, but one which is
fraught with danger of misuse of other
disciplines.
The need for a co-ordinated re¬
search programme on historical earth¬
quakes and other natural hazards is
obvious. Such research, the scope of
which is international and global, will
give further dimension to our know¬
ledge of what Nature has in store
for us.

I OUIMHIVIIO and destruction
EVERY island and coastal settle¬
ment in the Pacific Ocean area
is vulnerable to the onslaught of seis¬
mic sea-waves, the destructive oceanic
offspring of earthquakes (or seisms)
and volcanic eruption.
Some call them "tidal waves", a
name as misleading as it has been
persistent; these great waves are not
caused by tides. The Japanese, whose
islands have felt the destructive power
of the great waves for generations,
give us the name used internationally:
tsunami.
In 1868 and 1877 tsunamis devas¬
tated towns in northern Chile, and
caused death and damage across the
Pacific. A series of seismic sea-waves
generated by the eruption and collapse
of Krakatoa in 1883 killed more than
36,000 persons in the East Indies.
Japan lost 27,000 lives to the wave of
1896, and 1,000 more to that of 1933.

whose effects were less spectacular
but which took many lives and did
much damage.
Tsunamis occur most often in the
Pacific. Around this immense ocean
runs a zone of extreme seismic ac¬
tivity crowned by a volcanic "Ring of
Fire."
This seismic belt extends along the
major geologic faults, or fractures, and
the deep oceanic trenches of South
and Central America and the United
States, turning westward along the
Aleutian Island arc, then southward
through Japan and the Philippine Rep¬
ublic; here it branches westward to
Malaysia and Indonesia, and eastward
through New Guinea, the southern
island groups, and New Zealand.
The phenomenon we call "tsunami"
is a series of travelling ocean waves
of extremely long length and period.
In the deep ocean, their length from
crest to crest may be a hundred miles
or more, their height from trough to
crest only a few feet.
They cannot be felt aboard ships in
deep water, and they cannot be seen
from the air. But the kinetic energy
the energy of movement represented
by a tsunami is impressive: a tsunami
"feels the bottom" even in the deepest
ocean, and it appears that the progress
of this imperceptible series of waves
represents the movement of the entire
vertical section of ocean through which
the tsunami passes. In the deep
ocean they may even reach speeds of
over 900 km. per hour.
As the tsunami enters the shoaling
water of coastlines in its path, the
velocity of its waves diminishes and
wave height increases. It is in these
shallow waters that tsunamis become
a threat to life and property, for they
can crest to heights of more than
30 metres and strike with devastating
force.
Tsunamis are believed to originate
as displaced columns of ocean water,
but the displacing agent has not been
positively identified. Seismic or vol¬
canic alterations of the ocean floor,
provided they impart some vertical
movement to the water column, may
cause tsunamis. Submarine ava-

lanches on the slopes of the Pacific
trenches may also produce tsunamis.
Although it has been established
that a relationship exists between
seismic or volcanic disturbances and
tsunamis, the nature of this relation¬
ship is not well-defined. Tsunami
magnitude appears to be a function of
earthquake magnitude and depth,
water depth where the tsunami is
generated and the extent to which the
earth's crust is deformed by the earth¬
quake. But the combined effect of
these factors is still imperfectly under¬
stood.
The speed of tsunamis varies with
water depth, and it is this relationship
which permits prediction of tsunami
arrival times at all points in the Pacific
Ocean area.
A tsunami warning system and an
international tsunami information cen¬
tre serving all areas of the Pacific have
been set up at Honolulu, capital of
Hawaii. Their work has done much to
reduce the hazards of the tsunami the
most destructive of all waves.
Using seismographs and tide-gauges
scientists are able to predict almost
exactly when a tsunami will arrive at
a given seacoast since tsunamis are
known to travel at speeds that may
average from 650 to 800 kilometres an
hour, the exact speed depending on
the depth of water over which they
pass.
But it is still not possible to predict
what effect the topography of the
ocean floor will have on a tsunami.
It is not completely clear, for example,
why a tsunami's wave may be of negli¬
gible size at one beach, and of giant
proportions a few miles away.
What is certain, however, is that all
tsunamis like hurricanes are poten¬
tially dangerous, even though they may
not strike each Pacific coastline or do
damage at each coastline they strike.
So a constant tsunami watch has to be
kept and the peoples of the Pacific
alerted when the great waves roll
across the world's largest ocean.
International
warning system
THE Tsunami Warning System in the
Pacific is an international co¬
operative operation designed to predict
the arrival of seismic sea waves
(tsunamis) and to alert countries
throughout the Pacific region. In 1965
Unesco's Intergovernmental Océano¬
graphie Commission set up an Interna¬
tional Tsunami Information Center
which now works closely with the
Tsunami Warning System in the Paci¬
fic, operated by the United States
Weather Service from a headquarters
near Honolulu (Hawaii).
The International Information Center
provides aid in the establishment of
national tsunami warning systems and
technical advice on the latest warning
system equipment. It also maintains a
computerized storage and retrieval
system on tsunami data.
Unesco's Océanographie Commission
also established an International Co¬
ordination Group for the Pacific war¬
ning system which today numbers 15
member countries (1).
The first tsunami warning system in
the Pacific was set up in Hawaii by the
U.S.A. in 1948, two years after a
destructive tsunami took the islands
by surprise, killing or injuring over 300
persons and causing widespread
damage. Subsequently, the need for a
broader based international network
was shown when major tsunamis
swept across the Pacific from a
submarine quake off Kamchatka in
1 952 and from others near the Aleutians
(1957) Chile and Peru (1960) and
Alaska (1964).
The present Tsunami Warning System
in the Pacific operates primarily through
two lines of detection. The first is a
network of over 30 seismograph sta¬
tions which pick up the shock waves of
earthquakes and then determine their
magnitude and location. If the shocks
are strong enough and if the focus of
the quake is under the ocean or close
enough to it to disturb the ocean floor
a tsunami may have been generated.
The warning system H.Q. in Honolulu
reports the fact to all participant
countries and issues a preliminary alert
that includes the estimated time of
arrival of a possible tsunami.
The system then turns to its second
line of detection : a network of more
¿han 50 tide stations where gauges
record the cycle of the tides conti¬
nuously. Such gauges record tsunamis
as abnormal phenomena.
When confirmation is received by the
Honolulu H.Q. it alerts all countries to
the approach of a potentially destruc¬
tive tsunami.
New operational methods are now
being developed for the tsunami warn¬
ing system. Use of the latest technology
and instruments will reduce the time
needed to evaluate the tsunami hazards.
The system will use a large network of
ocean bottom and shore based seismic
and tsunami sensors to transmit data
to Honolulu and will eventually rely on
space communication satellites.

Was Atlantis
an island
in the
Mediterranean?
CAN the disappearance of the legendary
continent of Atlantis, described by
Plato in his Dialogues and the subject of so
much controversy and theorizing, be explain¬
ed in terms of an ancient seismic catastrophe
in the Aegean Sea? Some archaeologists
believe so or at least that the seismic history
of the eastern Mediterranean can throw
light on the sudden collapse, around
1500 B.C. of the Minoan empire and the
Cretan civilization, one of the greatest of
Antiquity.
v We now know -that 3,500 years ago the
eastern Mediterranean was the scene of
. one of history's most, gigantic natural disas-, ¡
ters: the explosion (around 1480 B.C.) of
the volcanic island of Santorin, 100ikm
north of Crete. The explosion sent millions
of tons of volcanic ash hurtling into the
atmosphere, giving rise to intensive atmos¬
pheric shocks and generating devastating
tsunamis that destroyed many ports and
towns of the Minoan empire.
Examining this cataclysm and the theories
that have been put forward about it, notably
by Prof. Spyridon Marinatos, Director of
the Greek Department of Antiquities, George
Pararas-Carayannis, Director of the Inter¬
national Tsunami Information Center in
Honolulu, writes : "Recent archaeological
work on the island of Santorin unearthed,
partly submerged below the sea, a comple¬
tely intact 3,500-year-old Minoan city.
Excavations by the University of Athens
uncovered one-, two-, and three-story
houses and numerous Minoan artifacts and
utensils. The absence of human skeletons
from the city indicates that the inhabitants
had advance warning of the oncoming
eruption of the volcano and had time to
evacuate the island". The volcanic eruption
and the tsunamis alone did not destroy
entirely the Minoan civilization. But for
two centuries the Minoan civilization on
Crete was weakened by numerous earth¬
quakes that destroyed its cities and caused
it to decline rapidly.
As for the legend of Atlantis, he concludes,
"Whether Santorin and the other Minoan
colonies on the Aegean islands actually
constituted the lost continent of Atlantis may
never be known with absolute certainty."
Santorin in the Aegean Sea (see map below) was once a volcanic island almost
1,500 metres high. Around 1480 B.C. it erupted. The crater blew sky-high,
and then the whole mountain collapsed, forming a huge cavity in the sea.
Into this cavity rushed some 62 billion m' of sea water creating waves that reached
hundreds of metres in height. Then just as quickly excess water rushed out
setting off giant waves (tsunamis) in all directions across the Mediterranean at
speeds of over 500 km per hour. Above, Thira, chief town of Santorin (also called
Thira) dominates a circular lagoon, where the sea replaced the vanished crater.
Of ancient Santorin there remains only the little group of islands seen in photo
below. This, according to one theory, is the source of the legend of Atlantis.

Letters to the Editor
SCHOOL CHILDREN'S PLEA :
STOP THE SLAUGHTER
OF BABY SEALS
Sir,
Shocked by the slaughter of seals
off Labrador since 16 March 1976, we
wish to express our surprise and
distress that such barbaric acts 'are
still allowed to take place in spite of
' widespread' condemnation'^ "the last
few years and protests by leading world,
figures.
We appeal to you to urge Inter¬
national organizations to do all they
can to put an end to this horrifying and
unspeakably cruel massacre, which is
rapidly leading to the extermination of
an entire species of animals and causing
a totally unjustifiable disruption in the
precious balance of nature.
In this petition we add our protests
to those voiced by Canada's "Green
Peace" organization and the Inter¬
national Fund for the Protection of
Animals, as well as those made by
France's Society for the Protection of
Animals and by thousands of people
who do not know how to express their
indignation effectively.
We solemnly promise never, to buy
anything which has been made from
the skin of these or any other wan¬
tonly massacred animals. Hoping that
our plea will be heard and that it will
help to save those baby seals which
are still alive.

THE NUCLEAR
NIGHTMARE
Sir,
Congratulations on your November
1975 issue, "30 Years After World
War II". Of particular interest was the
series of articles entitled "The Nuclear
Nightmare" by the Stockholm Inter¬
national Peace Research Institute. I
wholeheartedly agree with what the
authors say about the nuclear deterrent
and the scandal of arms spending and
the arms industry (and hence about
economic growth based on arms sales).
Above all they emphasize the danger
that the peaceful uses of nuclear
technology will foster the proliferation
of nuclear weapons.
But, I part company with your con¬
tributors when they imply that nuclear
power must inevitably be used in
research and in energy production. They
maintain that atomic energy is economi¬
cal and that "the electricity produced
by nuclear-power reactors is cheaper"
(than that generated by coal- and oil-
fired power stations).
I do not agree that electricity
produced by nuclear-power reactors is
an economic proposition. The Americans
have published sufficient statistical
evidence on the operating costs of
their nuclear-power reactors to prove
that they are hopelessly uneconomical.
Harnessing atomic power to generate
electricity consumes more energy than
it produces. In most countries this fact
is concealed because of military and
political considerations or by a massive
conspiracy of economic interests desi¬
gned to benefit companies with a vast
range of activities.
In calculating the cost of producing
energy by nuclear power, the following
factors must be taken into account:
the costs in terms of energy and capital
of prospecting for and extracting ores
for fuel; the disposal of nuclear wastes;
the costs of reprocessing fuel elements,
enriching uranium and setting up
control and safeguards systems: the
risk of accidents. We must also take
utilization factors into account (remem¬
bering that nuclear reactors are hardly
ever used to their full capacity) as well
as breakdowns which sometimes put
reactors out of service for years.
You do not say that experts predict
that the world's supply of uranium ore
will run out around 1980-1985, that
colossal dangers are involved in oper¬
ating breeder reactors and that reactors
pollute the environment with liquid and
gas effluents. If some scientists and
engineers disagree on these points, it
simply shows that no scientifically
proved definitive conclusion has been
reached in this field.
Your contributors do not Indicate that
the safe disposal of high-level waste
for centuries if not thousands of years
poses insoluble problems. Nor do they
point out that radiogenic heat acts on
vitrified wastes, that containers dropped
in the ocean are only designed to resist
pressure and corrosion for ten years,
and that the storage of atomic wastes
in containers must be carefully super¬
vised, with the substances refrigerated
and decanted (since radiation causes
the containers to corrode and fissures
to develop in them). Moreover, little
is known about either tectonic move¬
ments on the ocean floor or about
undergound water movements. Thus
there have been instances in the
U.S.A. ' of radioactive spring water
re-emerging near mines where wastes
have been deposited.

MISSING MILESTONES
IN WOMEN'S EMANCIPATION
Sir,
It is unfortunate that the "Unesco
Courier" should have omitted some
important facts in its March 1975 issue
devoted to International Women's Year.
The chronological list of "Milestones
towards emancipation" failed to give a
true and complete picture of women's
achievements. Out of 60 places cited,
less than a dozen are in India, Latin
America and Africa as opposed to 50 in
Europe and the U.S.A.
Many "milestones" were missing from
the list. For example, there was no
mention of women who have achieved
high political office in American and
Asian countries. I have in mind
Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of
India, Mrs. Golda Meir, former Prime
Minister of Israel, and Mme Isabel Mar¬
tinez de Perón, who as President of
Argentina was the first woman to
achieve the highest political office in
a contemporary state.
In my view your references to women
in the liberal professions gave an
Incomplete impression of women's
attainments; it would have interested
readers to have a more global picture
of women's activities in the world today.

IN SEARCH
OF GLOBAL HARMONY
Sir,
In the world today there Is a widening
gap between rich and poor, between
industrially developed countries and
developing, non-Industrialized countries,
between the literate and the illiterate.
Failure to close this gap could one day
cost millions of lives.
At this key moment In history an
Important International publication like
the "Unesco Courier" should discuss
subjects of global Interest with a bear¬
ing on this problem: an international
economic system designed to serve
mankind's needs Instead of generating
profits for certain regions of the world;
new forms of art giving deep satisfac¬
tion rather than superficial enjoyment;
an international political system that
recognizes the interdependence of all
peoples; a new global civilization and a
world fellowship of nations.
The task of creating global harmony
depends ultimately on the efforts of
every man and woman. And the "Unes¬
co Courier" Is in a position to communi¬
cate this Idea to the peoples of the
world.

NOT TO BE
SHRUGGED OFF
Sir,
I am delighted to give my name to
the 50 children of the primary school at
Etterbeek and their teachers, whose
"open letter" on world events was
published In your February 1976 issue.
I write this not only for myself but
on behalf of many persons who would
be capable of reading such a letter not
"with a shrug of the shoulders" but
with pleasure at realizing that such
children and teachers exist.
I should also like to congratulate
Mr. Basil Hembry on his acute analysis
of the arms race, that cancer of modern
society and its consequences (In the
letters page of the same issue).

UNESCO LAUNCHES FREE BRAILLE MAGAZINE
The first number of the "Unesco Braille Review", a magazine that aims to
inform blind people on themes in Unesco's fields of competence, appeared in
April 1976 in English, French and Spanish. It will be distributed free throughout
the world. The magazine is produced by Frederick Potter, a long-serving Unesco
staff member who lost his sight during World War II, and its articles will be
selected from Unesco's publications.
The first issue of the "Unesco Braille Review" consists exclusively of articles
from the "Unesco Courier". The articles are relatively short (even a 300-page
novel fills four to five bulky volumes when transcribed into Braille); they deal
with subjects of special interest to the blind, such as music and travel ("Blind
people's movements are often restricted", says Potter, "but in this way they can
travel with their fingers"); they have a broad general appeal to help meet the
special need for Braille literature in developing countries.
Thus, of the eight items in "Unesco Braille Review" No. 1, "A Stone Age
Orchestra" and "Music, Dance and Ecstasy" deal with music, the "Journal of a
Young Burmese Girl" and articles on the Celts and the Eskimos supply arm¬
chair travel, while "An Open-Air Museum in Niger" has a technical interest, since
the museum has been specially arranged to allow blind people to appreciate it.
Articles on the world's mineral resources and the work of the United Nations
Children's Fund complete the general appeal.
The English language edition of the "Unesco Braille Review" will be printed
and distributed in London by the Royal National Institute for the Blind. Early
production of the free magazine will be limited in the print-run and the number
of issues one this year, with two more expected in 1977.
In an introduction welcoming blind people to "the world-wide circle of readers
of Unesco publications", Unesco's Director-General, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow
writes: "From its very early days, Unesco has been concerned with the impro¬
vement of educational and welfare facilities for people without sight, through such
activities as the Braille Uniformity Programme, the creation of the World Braille
Council, the publication of a unique reference work, "World Braille Usage", and
in more recent years, Special Education projects for the Handicapped and the
provision of items of equipment for schools and training centres for the blind
in developing countries".
In conclusion Mr. M'Bow says he regards the launching of the "Unesco Braille
Review" as "one of the happiest and most noteworthy events of Unesco's thirtieth
anniversary year".

ANNE-MARIE MAILLARD
On 13 March 1976 our friend and
colleague Anne-Marie Maillard, photo
editor of the Unesco Courier, died after
a short illness. She was 32 years old.
She had been a member of the editorial
staff of the Unesco Courier since
1 September 1971. To her post she
brought a broad cultural background
and a youthful eye, alert to original
and striking illustrations from all conti¬
nents and all cultures. She helped to
transform our magazine and bring
distinction to its pages. To her out¬
standing professional gifts were added
a rare sense of tact and human warmth.
It is with deep sorrow that we pay
this tribute to her memory.

Tegh Bahadur, the ninth of the ten Gurus
(religious leaders) of the Sikh faith. Born
at Amritsar in the Punjab in 1621, Tegh
Bahadur, a musician and poet, became
spiritual leader of the Sikhs in 1665, at a
time of growing religious intolerance and
persecution in India, and took up the
cause of freedom of worship of the Hindus.
Detained on the orders of the Emperor
Aurangzeb, he was commanded to
change his faith or be executed. He chose
to give his life for the cause of freedom of
worship and In November 1675 was be¬
headed at Chandni Chowk, Delhi. A bio¬
graphy, "Guru Tegh Bahadur, Prophet and
Martyr", by Trilochan Singh, was publish¬
