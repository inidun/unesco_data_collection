A FOREST
GOES TO SEA
Bowater Paper Corporation
Airmen flying over the Swedish coastline sometimes see these huge racket-shaped forms
in the sea. They are thousands of tree trunks enclosed by a boom, being towed to a pulp
mill. Sweden, Finland and Norway were responsible for about 20 per cent of the world's
woodpulp output between 1946 and 1955. During this period output of timber from
the world's forests showed steady expansion. This was possible because most countries
have replaced the past follies ofabusing and misusing forests by rational policies. (See page 25.)

COVER PHOTO
Professional artists are increasing in
number. There are said to be 30,000
painters in Paris alone. Theoretically,
what distinguishes a professional paint¬
er from an amateur is the fact that he
makes his living from his paintings. But
how many professional painters are
there who work steadily for years and
yet sell only a few paintings; and some¬
times none at all ? How do they live ?
See page 14 for a report on the condi¬
tion of young artists in Paris today.

The more we know of the literature of other people the
better we are likely to understand their ways of life.
The recognition of this axiom has made the trans¬
lation of foreign works of literature one of the important
features of Unesco's Major Project for the mutual appre¬
ciation of the cultural values of Orient and Occident.
Last month Unesco's East-West international advisory
committee meeting in Paris was able to make public some
striking facts concerning the increasing activities of
Unesco member states in this domain. A few highlights:
The first volume of Shakespeare ever to be translated into
Arabic has been published in Cairo. (This is part of a five-
year-plan to translate 1,000 books into Arabic at the rate
of 200 a year.) The first translation of the Arabian Nights
directly from the original Arabic into Polish has been
completed in Warsaw. The U.S.S.R. has published over
eight million copies of works translated from Indian
languages, three million from the Arabic and a million
from the Persian. The National Academy. of Letters of
India is translating 100 Western classics into 14 Indian
languages. Japan has launched a three-year programme
for the translation of important works of Japanese philo¬
sophy into Western languages, while Viet-Nam is under¬
taking the translation of Viet-Namese classics into Eng¬
lish. Spain has announced that it will soon have courses
in Arabic language and literature in all of its 13 univer¬
sities; the French Government has adopted measures for
increased emphasis in secondary schools on the Moslem
World and the great civilizations of the Orient.
During the International PEN Congress held in Tokyo
last September discussion was organized, with the help of
Unesco, on the problem of exchanges and influences
between Eastern and Western literatures. The Congress
adopted an important resolution on the translation of
literary works which called for the raising of the general
status of translators and urged that PEN and Unesco
sponsor the training of more Western translators of
Eastern literatures. It invited PEN authors of the West
to facilitate translations of their works in economically
under-developed countries "'by agreeing where possible
to the payment of purely nominal fees for copyright."
The PEN Congress further considered the encourage¬
ment of the publication of translations of important
Asian works in Western countries to be "'of such imme¬
diate necessity" that it suggested that the normal system
of reviewing in Western countries was inadequate for
these works. It therefore urged all Western PEN Centres
to promote a system of pre-reviews in their countries so
that where a pre-review was favourable, every periodical
or newspaper of standing would give space for a review
of the work.

GYPS
WANDERERS E
THOUSAND
by Gerald Barry

A MYSTERIOUS PEOPLE, untamed and
nomadic, the gypsies have wandered to almost
every country in the world. Most of those
who still lead a wandering life have kept the
same physical characteristics as the early
tribeswavy dark hair, large black or brown
eyes and dark skin, but the settled tribes have
gradually come to look more like the people
of countries where they live. It has been said
that in music the soul of the gipsy has found
its fullest expression. From their ranks, too,
have come writers, philosophers, poets, dan¬
cers and artists. But for the vast majority
the call of the open road is irresistible. Photo,
right, shows gypsy entertainers in a cabaret;
far right, widow and son (sitting on steps) of
Django Rheinhardt, the gypsy guitarist who
became one of the greatest names in Jazz.
n a hot, dusty August day, in
the year 1427, a band of
extraordinary-looking foreigners
was gathered at the Porte
d'Orléans, Paris gateway to the
pilgrim route of St. James of
Compostella, clamouring for
admission. The men were
slight, agile, tawny types; the
women were slim and sinuous.
All had shining blue-black hair
and flashing penetrating- eyes set deeply in high-
cheek-boned faces of dark olive complexion. Against a
ringing of bells and a whirring of brightly coloured
revolving wooden clappers, they all seemed to be shouting
at once in a strange unknown tongue. The leaders were
richly dressed in scarlets and crimsons slashed with
brilliant emerald greens. Their gloved hands flashed with
barbaric jewels. Brocaded cloaks fell from their shoulders
which were "decorated all about .with great silver
buttons."
In a kind of pidgin Latin-French they made themselves
understood by the guards. They announced themselves
as, The Right Honorable Lord Panuel, Duke of Little Egypt
and Thomas, Earl of Little Egypt together with their
companions, bodyguard and servants to the number of
one hundred and twenty. They carried with them Letters
of Credence from His Holiness Pope Martin V, addressed
to His Most Christian Majesty Charles VII, King of France.
There was no doubt of the validity of the Fisherman's
Seal on the Apostolic document they presented. The
guards admitted them to the city and the court. The
Gypsies had arrived in Paris.
The story they told the King was one which they
recounted during the next ten years in practically every
court in Europe. It is known historically, even among the
Gypsies themselves, as "The Great Trick". The story ran
that when The Holy Family fled to Egypt from the fury
of King Herod, they pleaded for shelter and help from
the Gypsy tribes. All help was refused for fear of
offending the Pharaoh. Whereupon God sent a terrible
curse upon the whole of their race and condemned them
to wander forever, despised and hated.
They said they had recently been driven out of their
country of Little Egypt (it is strange that no-one ever
seems to have questioned the existence of this fictitious
country) by the Saracens and had roamed through
Bohemia and Germany and finally thrown themselves on
the mercy of the Pope who had given them absolution
and ordered them to do a penance of seven years, visiting
all the major shrines in Europe. This penance they were
now performing. The King having heard their story
could but give them the benefit of the doubt.
They received the "safe-conduct" and the city was
opened to them. Alas not for long. Their depredations
into the citizens' chicken-coops and general petty
thievery soon aroused the wrath of the Parisians. This

was, however, slightly mitigated by the rumour that these
strange people possessed wonderful powers of divination.
Indeed the Parisians flocked to the Gypsies in such
numbers that exactly one month later, the Archbishop of
Paris preached a solemn public sermon denouncing "these
sorcerers and fortune-tellers", excommunicated the whole
band and had them driven from the city. He then
thundered a further Edict of Excommunication on all who
had consulted them.
The Gypsies fled.. .for the time being A few weeks later
they turned up in Amiens, where they were given eight
golden livres and a safe conduct pass. Three years later,
we learn 'from a document conserved in the Archivo
Histórico Provincial of Huesca, that they were in Spain in
considerable numbers and had received a joyous and
hospitable welcome with almost undreamt of privileges
from the King of Spain.
It is only as the result of very recent scholarship that
we know with any certainty who and what these
mysterious people are. The Gypsies have always been
considered an almost complete ethnic puzzle. They were
thought by some to be Egyptians or Bohemians from
Centra] Europe or even a lost tribe of Israel; others
thought they were an offshoot of Manichean Persians, in
fact everything short of the reality. Yet each story had
something of the truth, reflecting the wanderings of these
peoples over the last two thousand years.
Recent university expeditions to Karakkorum, a region
lying between the south of the western Himalayas and
the western branch of the Kunlun range to the north
have established the existence of the fabulous tented
empire of Karak-Khitan in India. It has been discovered
that scattered Indian tribes still speak an almost identical
language to that of the purest Gypsy tribes. It is a
Prakritic branch of the Sanskrit tongue and here a
fascinating feature forces itself on our attention. At the
beginning of the first century A.D., there took place a
complete and absolute reformation of the Sanskrit
language, yet in the speech of the Gypsies, properly called
Romane (from "rom" the name of the whole collective
race, which is also the nome simply for "man"), there is
no trace of this reform.
It is this, above all, which confirms the scholars in their
conclusion, that at the time of the Mongol invasions, this
race cut itself off from the rest of the Sanskritl-speaking
people and emigrated in two main waves to Persia.
They were a low-caste race, but renowned as musicians,
mighty trainers of horses and as workers in gold and
silver. In Persia they were welcomed at first, particularly
as musicians, and were called Luri. Today in Iran they
are still -known by this name. The length of their stay
in Persia seems to have been very consi¬
derable, where apart from their musical
gifts, their ability to train horses and their
skill as metal-workers made them welcome
refugees.
It is generally agreed that it must have

HAS THE MODERN
WORLD A PLACE FOR THEM?
been during this period that the nature-worship they
brought with them from India became transformed by
their contact with Manicheanism. This would be the key
to much of the incomprehensible duality of their moral
and religious attitude today. The Tarot fortune-telling
cards which they introduced into Europe in the four¬
teenth century are full of pictorial Manichean symbolism.
It would seem that during this long sojourn in Persia,
the race became hardened into five main tribes. In spite
of more modern nomenclature, this division has been
maintained up to our day.
In the course of time, fresh waves of persecution led to
a further mass exodus. Those we now know as the Rom,
Manouche and Sintis the metal-workers, the musicians
and straw-weavers, and the trainers of animals went up
through Syria into Armenia. Here they separated. One
group went up through the Caucasus into Georgia and
Russia. Another wended its way through Anatolia into
Turkey where again a further split occurred. A large
group pushed northwards into Rumania, Hungary and
Bohemia; the second group crossed the sea to Crete and
settled in Corfu. According to the contemporary
Franciscan chronicler, Simeonis, this latter immigration
took place at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
The early Czech Chronicle of Dalimil, written in 1360,
specifically mentions their strange language and curious
begging formula. In Greece they were and are still
known as the "Acingani" from which would appear to
derive the Italian form of Zingari and the better
known Hungarian name of Tzigane. An early Georgian
manuscript mentions a strange band of sorcerers called
Atsincan, whom the Byzantine emperor Constantine
Monomachus (reigning from 1040 to 1055) sent to
Constantinople, to destroy the wild animals who were
devouring all the game in the Imperial hunting preserves.
About the same time as the first big exodus from Persia,
a second group, made up of the tribes who now call
themselves Gitans and Kales, went down through Arabia,
up along the shores of the Red Sea, through Palestine
into Egypt where they remained for a considerable time.
Later driven out by Moslem invasions, they crossed
through Libya along the North African coast into Spain.
They arrived in England about 1490. One band crossed
to Ireland and another headed by John Faw, who also
called himself Earl of Little Egypt, was received by King
James IV, of Scotland. The King empowered him by
Royal Writ, dated 1504, to exercise full authority over all
his Gypsy subjects. By the opening of the sixteenth
century the Romany race was established in every country
in Europe. From 1555 to 1780 a tremendous wave of
persecution, branding them as heretics and sorcerers,
swept through Christendom. They nevertheless survived
with their language, customs, taboos and trades intact.
The Emperor Joseph II, abolishing serfdom, gave them
freedom to wander wherever they wished, after his mother
Maria-Theresa had failed to settle them in villages. In the
last century the Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria,
not only entertained them at court but compiled a very
complete Gypsy Grammar and spoke Romane .fluently.
Obviously as nationalistic segregation hardened in
Europe, the Gypsy's complete disregard for frontiers raised
almost insoluble political problems. By the early part of
the 19th century they had penetrated into North America.
An interesting feature of their large settlement in the
State of Pennsylvania, is that these people speak the
purest of all the Romane dialects of which there are
now fourteen. Numerous tribes settled in all the South
American republics.
During the last war, more than five hundred thousand
of them perished in gas-chambers and concentration
camps. Those who escaped often fought with conspicuous
bravery and ingenuity with the Allied partisan forces.
It is interesting to recall at this point that because of the
enemy-occupying forces' almost superstitious dread of
these people, they were able to help hundreds of Jewish
victims in French concentration camps to escape into
neutral zones, under the clandestine leadership of a bril¬
liant Jesuit priest from Poitiers. For his work in this
connexion the Reverend Father Fleury, S.J. was appointed
at the end of th# war, to be Chaplain-General of all the
Gypsies and Nomads of France.
This outstanding and erudite churchman and many of
his confreres as well as a growing body of judicial and
administrative leaders are rightly concerned about the
future of the Gypsies of today. By the very historical
circumstances of their survival they are confirmed as a
nomadic people. Is there in our modern civilization a
place for these people? Since there are between five and
six million of them in the world, an answer is required.
With understanding and sympathy for their difficulties,
acknowledgement of their contribution and needs, there is
undoubtedly a solution to their problems. Like the wind
that carries the pollen and seeds of strange plants and
trees, to give variety and strength to the indigenous flora,
so these people have preserved in their racial memory,
various forms of behaviour, folk-lore, music and perhaps
most important of all, an intuitive sense of the forces of
nature that we, in our urban conception of life, are in
danger of forgetting and losing.

WAYFARERS OF THE WORLD, the gypsies can be found on the
roads of Europe and Asia and the flames of their campfires light up the
night in Africa and in far-off Australia. Those who settled in Pennsyl¬
vania in the USA speak the purest of all the Romane dialects. In cara¬
vans, on the backs of mules and donkeys (photo, above, was taken in
Murcia, Spain) they roam the world's highways and by-ways. But once
each year many of them come together at the famous pilgrimage of
Stes-Maries-de-la-Mer, in southern France.. They come here to pay
their respects (opposite page) to the Marys of Bethany, and to St. Sara,
the Patron Saint of Gypsies whose shrine is in the local church.

musical idiom, have nevertheless preserved by their very
traditionalism, essential Magyar musical forms which the
people themselves had forgotten. In the United States,
according to Duke Ellington, Django Rheinhardt, the fa¬
mous Gypsy guitarist, did more for the universal dissemi¬
nation of valid Jazz as a musical form than perhaps any¬
one else. Since the eighteenth century the Gitanos have
re-vivified Spanish music and have inspired composers
such as de Falla, Albeniz, Granados and Segovia who have
taken their places as the genii of Spanish musical culture.
This is but one sphere in which they have made useful
contributions. The late Tikno Adjams of the University
of Louvain was not only a great philosopher of the school
of Bergson but a very fine poet, yet he remained always
one with his people.
Since 1930 the Soviets have produced a Gypsy newspaper
called, not unsurprisingly, O Nevo Drom. (The New Way)
and have discovered many able writers among the nomads.
The Gypsy Theatre in Moscow was certainly the most
popular form of all entertainments for Muscovites during
the war (1). Between the wars, a famous Gypsy School for
boys was founded at Uzhord in Ruthenia, conditioned to
the particular needs of its pupils and later a similar
scheme was put into effect in Kygor in South Moravia.
Here a secondary schoolboy has recently written an ex¬
tremely able history of his people and has since (walking
in the footsteps of George Borrow, the first man to trans¬
late the Bible into Romane) helped with a new translation
of the Bible in the Gypsy tongue.
In France modern sociologists have taken into account
the devastating effects of forcing the nomad into an urban
sedentary life where he degenerates rapidly into a de¬
plorable type. The Rev. Father Fleury hit on the idea of
transforming large motor coaches into travelling schools
following in the wake of the caravans, which are now
mostly motorized. Certainly without attempting to change
the essential pattern of the life of these people, it
(1) Under a decree promulgated by the Praesidium of the
Supreme Soviet in October 1956, the last wandering gypsy bands
in the Soviet Union are gradually to be settled in places of
their choice. Each of the Republics is individually working out
the best ways to enable gypsies to tfke up fixed occupations.
. should be possible with an intelligent grasp of their prob¬
lems to find young educationalists who are willing to
travel and adopt the principles of modern educational psy¬
chology to their different needs.
Living and working with them, deeprooted prejudices
fall quickly away. Too often the petty dishonesty, the
lack of hygiene is conduced by the long-standing effects
of oppression. A small example of the attitude towards
hygiene can be taken from the above-mentioned travelling
school. Freed for once from oppressive laws and able
to camp freely by river or lakeside or even village pumps,
the youngsters with no compulsion would stop, strip and
bathe every day regardless of the temperature. Consider¬
ing their ages ranged from 13 to 18 they were at least
as hygienically-minded as the inmates of similar age in
many "prep-schools" on either side of the Atlantic.
Those who would like to see firsthand as many of the
varied aspects of the Gypsy tribes as possible cannot do
better, if in Europe, than visit the annual re-union of the
Romany from all over the world, which takes place once a
year between May 24 and 26, in the wild Camargue country
in Southern France. A few miles only from Aries, the
famous Pilgrimage of the Stes.-Maries-de-la-Mer is
marked by great devotion. Here they all arrive to pay
their respects to the Marys of Bethany and to St. Sara, the
Patron Saint of the Gypsies, who has her shrine in the
curious and mysterious mithraic crypt of the ancient Ro¬
manesque church. Here you will meet them all: Circus
millionaires and lawyers, poets, artists and artisans, musi¬
cians and dancers, be they Rom or Manouche, Sinti, Gitan
or Kale with all their differences and all their similarities.
They come from every part of the globe, from across the
Atlantic or from Eastern Europe for here cross the Gypsy
caravan routes of the world. Here too you will meet a
new generation of the young, who deprived of their tradi¬
tional trade as horse-dealers have become automobile
mechanics of no mean ability.
This is the great gathering of the "Rom", a people who
are vital, sometimes unthinkingly cruel, great lovers of
children, too often light-fingered by lack of education but
impulsive and capable of tremendous devotion to their
friends be they gageo (white men) or not. It is a friend¬
ship worth the patience and effort of winning.

SCHOOLS FOR GYPSIES
ENGLAND. Assimilation in State
and Church Primary Schools since 1908.
Some absenteeism especially in the Spring.
Small percentage continue to secondary
schools.
FRANCE. Small mobile school ex¬
periment under Church auspices. No formal
State educational facilities exist as yet.
SPAIN. Special educational facilities
provided in the Sacromonte Settlement
Area, under the jurisdiction of the Gover¬
nor of Granada.
U.S.S.R. Special Gypsy Schools
adapted to particular needs already exist in
large urban centres. Widespread effort in
rural areas being made, with mobile instruc¬
tors. Elementary teaching is given in both
Romane and Russian. Classes in Technical
schools are also adapted to their particular
aptitudes.
MOROCCO. Nomad Mobile schools
have been organized under the direction of
a religious order, with centre in Casablanca.
GERMANY. Attempted assimilation
in State Schools has been made. The prob¬
lem is at present under government scru¬
tiny.
SWEDEN. In 1954, the Swedish
Government appointed a Gypsy Commis¬
sion. The investigation embraced practically
the entire Swedish Gypsy population. Exis¬
tent experiment with Mobile Schools found
not entirely satisfactory. It is now proposed
to maintain Mobile Schools during the
8
summer, and during the winter months
to assimilate the Gypsy children in ordinary
State Schools, but to create special classes
such as exist for foreigners. It is proposed
to maintain a Permanent Consultant on
Gypsy Affairs under the Social Welfare
Board.
FINLAND. In 1954, there were
3,569 Gypsies in Finland. The Social
Research Bureau of the Ministry for Social
Affairs found that one-fifth of the total
population had gone to Primary Schools
while one-quarter had been to school for
some time, but later had given up atten¬
dance. It was found that one-third of the
adult Gypsies were illiterate and more than
half the rest could not write. Urgent consi¬
deration is now being given to implement
the recommendations of the Bureau.
These countries have been drawn at
random, showing a growing interest in
the problems involved in providing
necessary education for the children of the
Rom. There is a general realization among
nearly all governments that this is one of
the many educational challenges which must
be met. Social workers who have already
been appointed by their governments to
tackle the difficulties involved, have found
their work rewarding and satisfying.
Among the many who have devoted
untiring efforts on behalf of these peoples,
are numbered the names of Walter Starkie
of Trinity College, Dublin, and for many
years head of the British Institute in Ma¬
drid ; the Abbé Fleury, S.J. of Poitiers ; the
Abbé Barthélémy of Verdun, who has the
advantage of a perfect knowledge of Ro¬
mane; C.H. Tellhagen of the Nordiska
Museum of Stockholm, Ivar Lo-Johannson,
one of Sweden's most popular writers
to mention just a few.
All are agreed on one point : that even
when the Gypsy children attend the nor¬
mal State Schools it is absolutely essential
to make provision for their special needs.
There must be a wider disciplinary toler¬
ance and relaxation of strict time-tables to
avoid any sense of confinement. This is
particularly true of the Primary Grades. If
this is done it should then be possible to
assimilate the age groups 10 to 15 into the
normal classes.
A serious suggestion comes from a
French writer on Gypsy lore, Jean-Louis
Febvre. He proposes that social workers
on Gypsy problems from all countries
should take advantage of the yearly gather¬
ing of the Rom at Stes-Maries-de-la-Mer to
discuss with the Elders of all the
different tribes, these pertinent questions
which require so urgent an answer. It has
happened before in history, this calling
together of an immense Romani Kriss or
Court of Gypsies. Their Elders are often
very wise in the ways of the different tribes
and as M. Febvre says in his book, Les
Fils du vent (1) "their help would undoubt¬
edly be of the greatest assistance to all."

The Unesco Courier. April 1958
Translation in the Modern World
by B. Gary
CC For tne past two nunarea
years, the civilized world
has been wasting a vast
amount of energy in diligently
translating books published in one
language into all the others."
This flat statement made by an
eminent Sinologist and translator,
Georges Margoulies, reflects one
attitude to a characteristic problem
of our times. What is the place of
translation in the modern world?
The latest volume of Unesco's
Index Translationum lists 27,617 works
translated throughout the world in
1956 (see pp. 11 and 35). The data in
the Index cover only 52 countries out
of the hundred or so usually found in
an atlas, and in some cases, even
these data are very incomplete.
What is published represents only
a very small part of the translation
work which is going on all the time
in the modern world. Technical
translations although at least as
numerous as literary translations,
only occasionally make their appear¬
ance in print in bookshops. Technical
translators work on articles from
periodicals, patents, instruction books,
catalogues and photostats, and the
results of their labours are often
transmitted confidentially, in the
form of microfilms or typewritten
documents, by information centres or
private offices. And this takes no
account of the daily work accomplish¬
ed by anonymous commercial transla¬
tors, civil servants, countless bi¬
lingual secretaries and others.
The Yearbook of International
Organizations for 1954, for
example, listed 1,138 interna¬
tional organizations, societies, asso¬
ciations, unions, and federations.
Here again, the Yearbook really
covers only part of the world and
even in this part many societies take
.no steps to publicize their work.
The organizations listed publish
hundreds of periodicals, generally
bilingual or multilingual. During
1954, they held over a thousand
congresses, conferences, symposia,
seminars and other meetings, each
usually requiring the services of
bilingual minute writers, translators,
and interpreters. At a recent In¬
ternational Labour Conference, held
in Geneva, there were no less than
72 interpreters.
No reliable figures regarding the
translation of the dialogue of sound
films are available. However, it has
been established, for example, that
5,600 films were provided with sub¬
titles and 3,000 were dubbed in France
between 1946 and 1952. A report
published by Unesco shows that the
proportion of foreign films exhibited
in Italy. Spain, Sweden, Turkey,
Brazil and the Federal Republic of
Germany is still larger than in
France. In a country like the Soviet
Union, even national films are auto¬
matically dubbed in the principal
languages of the Union Ukrainian,
Byelorussian, Georgian, Armenian,
Kirghiz, Tadzhik, etc. and vice versa.
As for the United Nations, it has its
own film studio, and there are for
example, 18 different language ver¬
sions of the Organization's film,
"Defence of Peace/'
Here, we have referred only to the
best-known spheres of transla¬
tion, but there is no branch of
human activity today in which it can
be claimed that translation is not ne¬
cessary. In buying and selling, build¬
ing machinery or tackling scientific
problems, the services of translators
are indispensable. In the space of
twenty-five years, the number of
books translated has doubled in
France and quadrupled in Czechoslov¬
akia. There are now three times as
many foreign plays acted in Paris as
there were a quarter of a century
ago. At that time, dubbing had only
just been invented. Fifty years ago,
only a few international conferences
were held every year and they did
not use interpreters. Traditional
diplomacy has given place to that
extraordinary new phenomenon
known as "international life," which
sweeps into its orbit ministers and
scientists, industrialists and artists;
and this young Titan, of incalculable
strength, babbles in every tongue.
For this is another major aspect
of the problem.
Until the Renaissance, Europe had
lived in the illusion that there was
a universal language, of which all
others were more or less fortuitous
corruption. In the eighteenth century,
the Abbé Gédoyn, a translator and
member of the Académie française,
was still stating firmly that: "to
translate is to put a classical writer
Greek or Latin into a vernacular
language."
With the Renaissance, these "ver¬
nacular" languages began to come
into their own, but the great move¬
ment which was to follow was not
foreseen at that time. Very soon,
links had to be established, not only
between such languages and Latin,
but also among those languages
themselves. People were quick to
realize too, that vast cultural re¬
sources, no less rich and no less
ancient, existed outside the Greek
and Latin spheres. In India alone,
there are over one hundred languages
and dialects, and each of six of those
languages is spoken by more than
twenty million people. The Bible has
been translated, in whole or in part,
into 1,353 languages by the Bible
Society alone, without counting
translations made by other bodies.
Today, the man in the street is
beginning to recognize that different,
languages are a feature of life and
that, taken all round, one is probably
as good as another. This is indicative
of a very profound change and an
overthrow of habits which go back to
the beginning of time. In all civiliza¬
tions, the use of a certain language
has been one of the first distinguish¬
ing signs of humanity. A Slav is a
man who has the gift of slovo, or
speech, a foreigner being "dumb." To
the ancient Chinese, to speak a
foreign language was to be doomed
to the subhuman fate of a Barbarian.
This recognition of the linguistic
diversity of the human race is
probably more significant than is yet
generally realized. Suspicion and
superstitious fear of everything
foreign may henceforth give place to
a will to achieve that international
understanding, so essential to man¬
kind in a world in which technology
has suddenly given it power on a
planetary scale. Having for thous¬
ands of years stood slightly aside
from man's everyday concerns, the
translator suddenly finds himself at
the very heart of man's problems and
among the most important architects
of this new world without barriers
which is taking shape before our eyes.
After being considered as odd or
exceptional, he is now admitted to
the ranks of those whose services are
deemed indispensable and sought
daily.
So far we have spoken only of
translation in terms of space, but our
languages are also growing old.
Rabelais is already being translated
into modern French and the Ballad
of the Band of Igor into modern
Russian. The time will come when
similar translations will have to be
made of Sartre and Gorki, Faulkner
and Selma Lagerlöf...
T
hese then are the facts or some
of them.
Is there any reason here to
talk of waste and squandering of time
and effort? Are we to look back re¬
gretfully to the age of barriers, or to
hope for complete linguistic uniform¬
ity at some future date?
Immobility may have its attractions
and static periods may sometimes
have had much to recummend them,
but the contemporary world like life
itself is on the move, and all move¬
ment entails expenditure of energy.
Translation is one form of this
general movement and has become
necessary to modern
life, lending speed and
flexibility to its tempo.

tantly increasing num¬
ber of translations costs

Translation in
the modern world c-^
society an enormous amount of effort,
it is certainly not expended in vain.
Translation, far from diminishing the
efficiency of the activities which it
serves, on the contrary increases it
tenfold. Printing, too, calls for mental
and physical effort, but it is thanks
to this invention that each book is
read in thousands of copies and that
thousands of books are written where
only one would have been written
before. Translation plays its part in
this attempt to popularize all know¬
ledge. As Ernest Renan said: a book
which is not translated is only half
published.
Nor is this all: by establishing
contacts, translation greatly enriches
all forms of culture. Literature,
philosophy and science are able to
draw upon resources beyond national
boundaries, which they could not find
within the confines of any one
country.
And it is no exaggeration to say
that such comparison with the
achievements of other countries
enables any healthy and vigorous
culture to discover its own originality
and to find itself. All our literatures
began with translations. On reading
the Défense et Illustration de la Lan¬
gue française, the first impression is
that it is a treatise on translation.
In his talks with Eckermann,
Goethe foresaw and welcomed the
advent of a universal literature. The
twentieth century has indeed put the
stamp of unity on this world of ours;
it has made men aware of their inter¬
dependence on a world-wide scale.
This in no way implies a fusion of
individual means of expression or
any sort of levelling down. Never
before, perhaps, have national feeling
and the desire for cultural individual¬
ity been so strong in all continents.
Analysing the fact that "conscious¬
ness is beginning to be planetary,"
such a man as Thornton Wilder has
said that he regards this as a further
extension of human consciousness.
Henceforth, to quote his own words,
"new is the response provoked in the
writer in relation to his own language
and his own environment."
Translation has become a human
activity of basic importance. The
translator, formerly unappreciated,
has left his ivory tower to come down
into the market place, into the
workrooms and shops, into the
councils of the great and the games
of the children. He is the tireless
builder of bridges at the very heart of
a universe which has adopted the
motto of the sage of Weimar: "What
matters is to travel."

BRIDGES BETWEEN EAST & WEST
An analysis of Index Translationum'
by Robert L Collison
It is very tempting to regard the Index Translationum
solely as a bibliography: it is arranged as one, and
the majority of its users have an overwhelmingly
bibliographical interest in its contents. Reference librar¬
ians are well accustomed to handing the Index to
readers who wish to check whether a certain book has
been translated, and frequently make use of it themselves
for discovering such details as original titles. For these
purposes the Index is an admirable tool and, as its long
file increases year by year, it will very soon cover the
whole world. There would thus appear lit.tle point in
singling it out from the many other excellent inter¬
national bibliographies which are now in being.
To make no more use of the Index Translationum than
one would of a bibliography of iodine, of gerontology or
of genealogy, would however be to ignore completely its
value as a significant human document in the increas¬
ingly important matter of the effective communication
of ideas. The history of translation has never been
adequately written: it may indeed be an impossible task,
for who can assess the degree of impact of an idea, who
can trace accurately a curve denoting the decline in that
impact according to the length of delay which it
undergoes? Such ideas arise as one glances through the
columns of the Index, for there is much evidence that
very few books achieve speedy translation.
Even more important is the fact that while some
fortunate works are translated into several languages
immediately, their language-field may still be somewhat
limited geographically. Thus, the Index Translationum,
1953, shows that Alain Bombard's Naufragé Volontaire
appeared within a year also in Danish, Dutch, English,
German, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and
Swedish a considerable achievement until one considers
that no Asian or East European language is included in
this' list. One can then make an analysis of the exchange
of culture between Asia and the Western world during
the same year. But as it is compiled from the Index Trans¬
lationum, it is not complete since some countries are not
represented. Yet it does give a fair picture of the present
state of affairs and there is no reason to believe that the
analysis of other years would reveal any important
differences.
The analysis shows that books were translated into
Asian languages from Polish, Russian, German, Norwe¬
gian, Ancient Greek, French, Italian and English, for the
countries of Cambodia, Ceylon, Egypt, India
and Indonesia. (Japan, with its 1,299 transla¬
tions, has been omitted, since its statistics
would unduly distort the picture given by
the remainder of the countries.) It will
be noted that' among the languages missing

ancial , Linguistic
from this list there are both Spanish and Portuguese, lan¬
guages which embrace not only the Iberian peninsula
but also the whole of Latin America. This means Asia
will remain almost completely unfamiliar with the works
of important contemporary South Américain novelists,
such as Gabriel Casaccia of Paraguay, the Colombian
Eduardo Caballero Caldeón, and the chief of Brazil's
modern literary movement Mario de Andrade (1893-1945).
Nor is this to say that the Western world is much
better off concerning Latin-American literature. Few
people in Europe are familiar with Argentine's out¬
standing writer Victoria Ocampo and her works of
literary criticism on Dante, Keyserling, Virginia Woolf,
etc. Admittedly poetry makes special demands on the
ability of the translator, but this should not excuse the
neglect, outside the Spanish-speaking world, of eminent
writers like Jorge Carrera Andrade of Quito, Jose Luis
Cano from Andalusia, or Venezuela's Miguel Otero Silva.
The position is even worse as far as Asian languages
are concerned. The analysis shows that in the exchange
of ideas the West is the gainer, since the number of
Asian works translated is large and also covers many
countries. But an examination of the type of books
translated reveals very unequal treatment. While there
is a tendency to translate the older works, and those of
such outstanding writers as Sri Aurobindo, Das Gupta,
Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru, etc., there are large fields quite
untouched; thus, such Telugu poets as Viresalingam,
Guruzada, Nanduri and Devulapalli, are known only to
Western specialists. The poems of Kuo Mo-jo, now
President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along
with the novels of Pa Chin, Mao Tun and China's leading
woman writer Ting Ling, remain mostly in their original
language, and the West has not been able to read The
White-haired Woman (a play co-operatively written by
members of the Lu Hsun Academy at Yenan), or Taghi
Maddarasi's Jecholiah and her Loneliness which was
recently published in Teheran.
Robert Musil, long neglected in his native Austria and
in Germany, wrote Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften in 1930
the English edition of this great novel did not begin
to appear until 1953, and, although the translation was
warmly welcomed and had a kind of literary success,
its impact was hardly that of C. K. Scott Moncrieffs
translation of Proust which reached English-speaking
readers very soon after the publication of the original
volumes. Henri Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes
waited 16 years before an English translation was publish¬
ed, and its effect cannot therefore be compared to that
of Kafka's works which were available in other languages
very early. This state of affairs continues.
Nor is such a position restricted solely to literature: in
the field of art, the works of Emile Mâle and Henri
Focillon are largely unknown to those who cannot
read French. Take for instance, Focillon's remarkable
L'An mille (Paris, Colin, 1952) which summarizes with all
the vigour of an outstanding scholar the state of the world
in the apocalyptic year a.D. 1,000: even to mediaevalists,
outside of France, this book is mostly unknown. Similarly,
in the more practical fields of industry and trade, such
works as Marc Rosenberg's Geschichte der Goldschmiede¬
kunst auf technischer Grundlage (Frankfurt, Keller and
Baer, 1910-22, 4 parts), Marcel Huet's Traité de pisci¬
culture (2nd ed. Brussels, La Vie Rustique, 1953) and
Lucien Neipp's Les Machines à imprimer depuis Guten¬
berg (Paris, Club Bibliophile de France, 1951), remain in
their original languages publishers who have been
approached claim that there is not the public for such
works to make translations a commercial proposition.
The barriers which face the translator are in any case
real and discouraging. In the first place he must satisfy
himself that no translation of the book he has in mind
has already been madea point on which the Index
Translationum provides good guidance. Then he must
obtain translation rights: the words Tous droits de repro-
12
auction et de traduction même partielle formellement
réservés stare at him from the back of each title-page,
and the concession he seeks is by no means easily obtained
if he is a newcomer to the work. For months, perhaps
years, he must maintain himself while he makes his
translation. As his only intellectual reward his name
may appear on the title-page, . and even then the
reviewers' disagreement with minor points of interpreta¬
tion may suffice to condemn his whole effort.
The legal position and the problem of payment for
translation rights may partly explain why the lists of
translations into Asian languages include so little contem¬
porary material. For instance, in Indonesia in 1952
translations were made of Fenimore Cooper's Last of the
Mohicans, Dumas' La Dame aux camélias, Gogol's Taras
Bulba, Kipling's Elephant Boy, the Adventures of Baron
Mimchhausen, Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and three plays
of Shakespeare. The only well-known modern works were
Dale Carnegie's How to win friends and influence people,
Stephen Vincent Benét's The Devil and Daniel Webster,
and Dorothy Parker's The Big Blonde.
Thus the Index Translationum in recent years has
listed little copyright material and few scientific or
technical works for Asian countries. While not
denying that the selection of non-copyright classics is a
wise move for any publisher who is building up his list of
steady sellers, the present outlook for the contemporary
creative writer is not bright. Assuming that in any one
country perhaps only five works of international importan¬
ce are issued in any single year, it is reasonable to try
to ensure for those works a world audience as speedily as
possible. Between those works and their potential readers
in other countries and continents lie various barriers
legal, financial, linguistic. None of these is insuperable,
given a modicum of goodwill and continuing international
co-operation. By means of mutual agreements for the
exchange of literary property, the legal and financial
barriers could be swept away at least for those countries
which lack large reserves of foreign currency.
The linguistic barrier is however far more substantial.
In the first place translators are not plentiful in any
country, and they face many problems. F. A. Rush gives
some idea of the difficulties which exist concerning
dictionaries ("Dictionaries and the translator", Inter¬
national PEN bulletin of selected books, March 1955,
pp.7-10), pointing out that most dictionaries continue to
perpetuate a false idea of translation. Brenno Silveira
in his brief but masterly A Arte de traduzir (Sao Paulo,
Ediçoes Melhoramentos, 1954) emphasizes the differing
claims of free and literal translation. Other difficulties
are speed in the case of topical works, and inadequate
payment. All these difficulties affect Asian and Western
translators alike, though the larger potential audiences
in many Western languages tends to make translation in
the West slightly easier.
To the individual translator one or more of these
difficulties may be insuperable. One solution is pointed
to in the entry for Burma in the Index Translationum.
Each year the Index lists a number of translations done
by the Burma Translation Society. This is an idea which
could be adapted to suit the needs of many countries,
and provide parts for different categories of people.
Critics could join in the work of selecting the right books
to be translated, business men organize negotiations over
copyright and publication details, language experts divide
the field according to their various skills, while well-
informed amateurs might share the work of proof¬
reading, publicity and marketing.
The exchange of literary output between East and West
remains quite inadequate, slow and uncertain. A more
intensive study of each other's publications and improved
international co-operation over translation could
however, help the reader of the future to become aware
of intellectual advances without the long delays to which
the world is now accustomed.

TREASURES THAT MARCO
POLO LEFT BEHIND
IT was in the thirteenth century that the Polo family, Nicolo, his brother
Maffeo and his son Marco, travelled overland across Asia to Bokhara, to
Kashgar, across the Gobi desert and on to the court of the Grand Khan
near Peking, farther east than any previous European. Their quest was for
the material wealth of the Orient, its rich carpets and silks and spices. ~
Far greater treasures did not reach the West for many centuries the liter¬
ary and spiritual wealth of Asia. It was not until the nineteenth century
that scholars turned their attention to the great literary and religious classics
of the East, and not until the past few years has there been much progress
in making them accessible to the general reader. This is one of the main
objectives of Unesco's "'Translation of Representative Works" programme.
As part of this undertaking, Unesco has sponsored numerous translations
from Arabic, Persian, Chinese, Japanese
and the languages of India, Pakistan and
Ceylon, and has stimulated and supported
the efforts of publishers interested in such
translations.
This page is* framed by the Buddhist
motif used on the cover of the series of
UNESCO-sponsored translations published in
France by Gallimard under the title of
"Connaissance de l'Orient" ("Knowledge
of the Orient"). Also shown here is the
cover from the jacket of the American edi¬
tion of the UNESCO-endorsed translation
from the Japanese of "The Makioka Sis¬
ters". This important novel by Junichito
Tanizaki is being published simultaneously

Machines, technology and clock-regulated working
hours have invaded our world but they have not
diminished the prestige of the artist in modern
society. They seem in fact to have achieved just the con¬
trary. An explanation for the mounting prestige of the
artist today was recently voiced by a sculptor in Paris.
"Most people," he said, "'now go through life doing pretty
much the same thing day after day and their existence
can be compared to the humdrum recitation of a lesson
learned at school. We artists are privileged people. All
our lives we are engaged in doing something new and dif¬
ferent. We live by creating."
There is no denying that creative art appeals to the
popular imagination today as much as ever it did before.
But it is a pity that so many people, including art lovers,
continue to cling to the old romantic stereotype of the
artist as a person living either a life of glory or a life
of misery, but never anything in between.
The paintings of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec are
unquestionably admired for their intrinsic merits. But
is it idle to wonder Whether their works would arouse
as much interest and enthusiasm with the vast general
public if Van Gogh, for example, had died peacefully in
his bed instead of tragically by his own hand, and if
Toulouse-Lautrec had been a tall, well-built man of sober
habits? According to the stereotype, the artist is a lonely
figure rejected by' society, and is at one and the same
time a pariah and a god. Poverty, alcoholism and near
madness (sometimes total insanity) are directly respon¬
sible for the masterpieces the artist produces and lead
him to a death which is seen as a triumphant and highly
original exit from our world.
If this conception of the artist is
accepted it would seem pointless and
even improper to discuss the living
conditions of painters and sculptors.
Yet who can seriously accept such a
picture of the artist today? The
average artist's life is, in fact, hum¬
bler, simpler and more taken up with
day-to-day cares.
We have tried to give an account
of this, the real life of the artist, .
against the background of Paris in
1957, especially the Paris of the Left
Bank, ready as always, to recognize
talent from every corner of the world,
but with no time for those who lack
purpose or for failures. Purely aesthe¬
tic problems have been left aside for
they do not enter into the scope or
purpose of this inquiry. An artist
does not change from representation¬
al to abstract art, or vice versa,
solely with an eye to material gain,
or if he does, it is because his talent
and vocation are so slight that his
interest is centered exclusively on
"market fluctuations". We had many
long and friendly talks with artists
and during the course of them we
met very few who were not suf¬
ficiently devoted to their work to re¬
fuse to make any serious concessions.
The first surprising thing one dis¬
covers about the world of artists is
the ease with which one has access
to it. Even the most famous acade¬
mies and studios give visitors a cor¬
dial welcome. Though we met some
of the best-known contemporary
painters and sculptors, we concen¬
trated our attention on the younger
artists whose problems, hopes and
ambitions form the central theme of
this inquiry.
What do |we mean by the "'young
The Unesco Courier. April 1958
artist?" One academy teacher gave the following terse
definition: "A painter is young at 60, if he has not yet
made his name". There are many artists whose talent
develops late and others who, undaunted by constant
failure, nevertheless persevere. One woman pupil, full of
enthusiasm, admitted to being ninety-one.
The Annual Exhibition of Paintings by Young Artists
(Salon annuel de la Jeune Peinture) used to accept only
works by people under thirty years of age. In 1956, that
age-limit was raised to thirty-five, and it may perhaps
soon be raised to forty. Many of our interviews suggest¬
ed the likelihood of this development.
It is impossible to say exactly how many painters and
sculptors there are, for these are not organized profes¬
sions. As a frame-maker said to us, with a sigh of relief:
"They escape the clutches of the statisticians". In theory,
a professional artist lives by his painting that is what
distinguishes him from the amateur. But many profession¬
als sell very little or nothing at all for years on end. Esti¬
mates by painters and sculptors themselves about the num¬
ber of their fellow-artists vary greatly. One will tell you
that there are scarcely more than a thousand profession¬
al artists in the Paris area but in any case, no one
places the total number of painters in Paris at more
than 30,000, and there appears to be only twice that
number in the whole of France, counting both profession¬
als and amateurs. Whether that is a high figure compar¬
ed with other European countries and
the world in general is difficult to
say. What is certain, however, is that
there are far fewer sculptors: in the
whole country, perhaps two thousand

YOUNG
ARTISTS

la Vie de Bohème' - A thing of the past
and, in the capital itself, only a few hundred.
Painters are increasing in number; sculptors are becom¬
ing fewer. This again is easily accounted for: sculptors'
materials are very costly and for their work they need
large studios, and if the sculptors wish to execute large-
sized works, these should be on the ground floor. Again,
sculpture is difficult to sell. It is probably easier to find
a market for statuettes, but then there is the problem
of protecting them against copying. In the world to¬
day, growing importance is attached to what can be seen
and less and less to what can be touched. Painting is
not out of its element in an essentially two-dimensional
world, whereas sculpture is to a greater extent.
Young French artists come from all over the country
to work in Paris. The South seems to contribute a larger
contingent judging by many of the voices we heard with
the sing-song accents of Languedoc or Provence! It could
hardly have been by chance that during three months
we met hardly any young artists from Northern France.
Paris is above all cosmopolitan, and foreigners often
make up between a third and a half of academy
students. The length of their stay in Paris varies greatly;
some settle there for good, while others the majority
only remain for a few months. The English-speaking
world, and particularly America, has been well represent¬
ed since the last war. Young Americans have developed
a taste for France, thanks to the generous fellowships
granted by their Government to veterans. Many Spani¬
ards found refuge in France after the Civil War and
some of them have become naturalized. Today young
artists continue to come from Spain. Paris has always
attracted people from the East, and especially from the
Far East, and its popularity is also still as great as ever
among the Germans, the Scandinavians and France's
Benelux neighbours. As varied as the representation in
this Parisian Tower of Babel are the financial resources
of its inhabitants. Some enjoy comfortable maintenance
grants; oters are hard up and, like those of their
French companions in similar circumstances, make both
ends meet as best they can.
Even Parisians, convinced as they are of the perennial
charm and greatness of their city, marvel at the extra¬
ordinary and universal prestige which it enjoys. Success
in Paris ensures world-wide recognition, and many
foreign artists find it worth while to visit or revisit it,
simply to exhibit their works. Rich foreign buyers
especially Americans and South Americans or their
agents do the round of the exhibitions.
In the past Montparnasse vied with Montmartre for
ARTISTS' CLUB, the Foyer des Artistes, in the Montparnasse area
of Paris provides artists and students with low-priced meals and serves
them as a meeting place where they can discuss their work. The

Foyer was founded by a well-known local man, Marc Vaux, and is run
privately by a committee. The value of its work is recognized by the
artists of Paris, and this year, 73 well-known painters have donated

the honour of being the most flourishing artists' quarter
of Paris. They still hold the same enchantment for the
French; many would like to live there, but that is a
dream beyond the reach of many a purse. Here, most
of them feel at home, chatting on the café terraces or
taking their meals in the small restaurants frequented
by a regular clientele. Here, too; good painting mat¬
erials are easily accessible. In Montparnasse there are
plenty of shops selling artists' materials, paints, can¬
vases, etc, and there is no lack of art galleries.
Nevertheless, young artists from abroad are quite often
disappointed. They have so often heard their elders sing¬
ing the praises of these Bohemian neighbourhoods where
credit is easy to come by, that they are often cruelly
disillusioned when they find themselves facing the harsh
realities of a Paris which no longer knows the carefree
days of the past.
We found a certain similarity in the social background
of painters and sculptors; practically none belong to the
working classes and very few are of peasant origin. On
the contrary, all sections of the middle class produce
their artists, from the industrialist's wife, who finds
pleasure in painting or does it simply to pass the time,
to, for example, the son of an industrial draughtsman
who is often a bit of a puzzle to his family.
But how their educational levels vary ! Although some
of the artists we met in academies and studios were Sor¬
bonne graduates or former students of schools of fine arts
or of decorative art, others had never gone beyond a
rather sketchy primary education. However, all painters
and sculptors, without exception, are keenly interested

among painters is coming, more and more, to resemble the collective

The Unesco Courier. April 1958
in literature and other arts which they realize, to a greater
or lesser degree, are akin to their own work. A young
painter who left school at an early age, told us that his
favourite pastime was going to the Comédie-Française.
We know him well enough to be sure that this was no
mere intellectual snobbery; intellectuals and authors
enjoy amazing prestige as much as great actors among
these young artists.
A great deal of variation can be seen in the means of
subsistence, and consequently the social status, of young
painters and sculptors who have not yet met with success.
Parents who are more or less well-off encourage their
children's vocation, even if they have no understanding
of modern art or are fully aware of the hazards of such
a career. They may continue their financial support for
years. Yet it is more common for a family to lose interest
at a fairly early stage, or to show downright hostility.
The arguments put forward are generally hackneyed:
painting and sculpture do not provide a living, are
scarcely compatible with middle class morality, threaten
mental stability (in point of fact, statistics show that
there is a high percentage of neurotics among painters)
and, above all, are useless to society. If the clash becomes
sharper, the young man with monied parents finds him¬
self in exactly the same situation as a companion with
a humbler background.
Painter by day: porter by night
Most young artists in Paris. have also to look to other
fields in order to earn a living. Some prefer to
take up an entirely différent occupation; young men,
for instance, can be seen at night working at Les Halles
(the Central Paris Market), while girls may look after
children. Others seek work more closely related to their
chosen profession, for example, doing sketches for restau¬
rants and night-clubs or window-dressing for shops or
large stores. Others again work as drawing teachers for a
few hours each day. Their main idea, of course, is to keep
as much time as possible for their own creative work.
Many young writers today are also going through the
same difficulties.
To achieve success while still very young is very excep¬
tional. Is it even desirable? Painters and sculptors even
more so believe that their art requires maturity and full
development of the personality, and they readily endorse
the view that "'Genius is but an infinite capacity for tak¬
ing pains".
While lack of security and erratic meals do not unduly
depress young people of twenty, anxiety to make a decent
living begins to worry those who have reached thirty.
Driven by want, those without a very strong vocation
very often abandon their art at that age, when absolute
values seem less Important particularly as the second
occupation is likely to be more remunerative.
It is also between twenty and thirty that the problem
of marriage arises for artists, as it does for most other
people. Although there are always some bachelors ready
to emphasize the disadvantages of a home-life it in¬
trudes on working time, especially if a child is born too
soon the artists whom we interviewed repeatedly stressed
how important a happy married life is to mental stjbi-
lity and conscientious work.
Here was a subject on which we particularly felt we
should have the views of women painters, who, at least
in the academies, are almost as numerous as the men.
For women, marriage implies far greater changes in their
way of life and far more serious hindrances to the con¬
tinuation of their creative work. A 22-year old girl from
Luxembourg told us: '"It is very difficult to continue
painting if one marries, unless of course one marries a
painter", and this seems to be a general opinion among
her sister artists. Without wishing to lay down any gen¬
eral rule, it must be admitted that a woman
painter or sculptor who marries and has
children is obliged to relinquish many, if
not all, of her ambitions, if only because of
the cramped quarters in which she has to

YOUNG
ARTISTS
(Continued)
Adventure
into art
There are several choices before the young artist seeking
to develop his skill and knowledge. He can study and work
on his own, visit a private art teacher, enrol in the official
school, the Ecole des Beaux Arts, or attend one of the many
academies and art schools. Left, a class in one of the oldest
and best known of the Paris art schools, La Grande Chau¬
mière which, for 1,000 francs a week, offers artists a daily
session with a model. Below, students in the engraving and

ART GALLERIES', like this exhibition on the Boulevard St. Michel, Latin Quarter, Paris, are often used by artists to display
their works to the public. It Is every painter's dream to show his works In a private gallery, but the cost of renting one is often beyond his means.
live even when her home is something better than an
attic room on the sixth floor.
To marry an unknown painter or sculptor is a proof
of courage looked at from the viewpoint of material ad¬
vantages; it means taking a gamble where the chances of
an easy, comfortable life are slight. In addition, the
"creator" may lose himself in work for hours, days or even
weeks. We have, nevertheless, met successful couples. In
one case, for example, the wife continues with her sculp¬
ture and looks after the children, while the husband works
at painting and also at engraving which sells very well.
In order to become known, a painter can, of course,
rely on luck, on connexions he may have, or he may
get help from friends who are already well-established.
Picture dealers, on the look out for works, may some¬
times decide to buy one or several or even an artists'
entire output. These dealers know exactly what their
customers want and at the same time they influence
these tastes with skill. There are some in Paris who
search for works by young painters and dispatch them
all over the world. One artist in his thirties and already
on the road to success, told us that he had sold three
of his works in one week for 360,000 francs, all of them
to customers in America. The Benelux and Swiss markets
also offer good outlets, but French customers are less
numerous. The realistic outlook of certain artists in
business dealings would surprise' those who insist that
artists always live with their heads in the clouds.
All artists make use of the open exhibitions ("salons")
to bring their works before the public, but without being
over-optimistic about the results. Among dozens or even
hundreds of works, it can hardly be hoped that one or
two paintings will attract notice. The position allotted
to the works is all important, because the effect produc¬
ed by a picture depends so much on the light. But much
depends toó on the visual fatigue of the visitor, who
will really only see about a dozen out of a hundred works;
it is then that the influence of a patron can work wonders.
But, in fact, no more favouritism exists here than in
other spheres.
It is every painter's dream to be able to show his works
20
in a private gallery. But the cost of hiring premises is
generally over 100,000 francs (£85) for a fortnight, and of
course, it is more than this for the largest and best known
galleries. In addition, the picture-dealer will take 20%
to 30% on any sale. Painters often think these charges
exorbitant, but it must be admitted that intermediaries
run risks. We met a former painter who runs a small,
attractively arranged, gallery where works can be shown
free of charge. This, of course, is a real godsend.
Lean years for the young sculptor
A painter enjoys security, at least from year to year,
when he is bound by a contract with a picture-
dealer. It starts with a small contract, and then, if
both sides are satisfied, the amount is increased. A thirty-
five-year-old painter told us about his contract, which, sub¬
ject to the production of an average of three pictures a
month, brings him in an income of 100.000 francs a
sum which will soon be doubled.
Yet this system also has its disadvantages. Is not the
painter likely to become the dealer's employee, turning
out works to order? And may not the dealer oblige the
artist to increase his output to satisfy the customers?
If abstract Works sell better, the artist has to give up
representational painting. Some artists therefore prefer
to put up with difficult conditions for a few years rather
than be bound by a contract while still quite young.
After the age of thirty, a painter is far less liable to
be influenced, because he has mastered his craft. At this
stage, a contract gives him a chance to work in peace,
without jeopardizing his integrity as an artist.
A young sculptor has greater difficulties to overcome,
since it will be many years before he can hope to make
a living by his work. All those galleries dealing
exclusively in sculpture are in difficulties or have closed
down, and it is quite exceptional for a dealer to offer a
contract to a sculptor. While there is an astonishing
amount of speculation in paintings, there is no competi¬
tion among private buyers for bronze or marble. Re¬

IN CREATIVE ACTION, sculptor has a male model, of whom there are only a few in Paris, posing for him. Sculptors are also fewer todaythere
are only a few hundred In the capital and perhaps 2,000 throughout France. Materials are costly, and just now there is little demand for sculpture.
was sold for 1,500,000 francs, while a Maillol sculpture
only just fetched 300,000 francs.
A sculptor may receive a commission from a local
authority a municipal monument, for instance. He
benefits mainly in this case from the law which stipulates
that one per cent of the cost of any public building shall
be allocated to the work of sculptors.
General conditions, which are not very propitious for
sculptors, explain why they also turn to the more profitable
art of painting, whereas well-known painters often try
their hand at sculpture fairly late in life.
A young artist cannot avoid quite high professional
expenses. Only rarely is painting or sculpture done
without a model. The cheapest solution is, of course,
found in the academies, which for a femall fee provide
the artist with models. But he is not free to choose aU
the poses that he might like to study. If he has the
means, therefore, he employs a model in his own studio
when he is lucky enough to have one. The average
charge for three hours is 1,000 francs (just under £1). It
is not too difficult to find models in Paris, but professional
models are fast disappearing. We met a male model, who
told us proudly that he had only three or four professional
rivals in the whole of Paris.
The material with which an artist has to equip himself
tends to become increasingly expensive as he grows more
proficient in his craft. Raw materials have been affected
by the general rise in prices. A cotton canvas costs 650
francs (about 10/-) a metre. A linen canvas, of far
better quality, may cost as much as 2,000 francs (nearly
£2). We have ourselves seen young painters in the
academies painting on anything they could find. Any
old thing will do as a palette. Tubes of paint of standard
size cost anything from 80 to 900 francs (1/6 to 17/-) each.
Rich cadmium colours are very popular but, owing to the
needs of the electronic and nuclear industries, cadmium
has become scarce and therefore expensive.
Generally speaking, a young artist rarely spends more
than 10,000 francs a month on his materials. If he
becomes known, his expenses Increase and may come to
more than 50,000 francs a month.
Talking with painters, we were surprised to discover
how little most of them knew about the chemistry of
colours. Our impression was confirmed by shopkeepers
and art teachers, the pessimists explaining that young
painters, out for quick success, attach no importance to
the lasting quality of their works. The optimists simply
say that a painter cannot be a chemist too and should
therefore trust his usual supplier.
Not enough studios for everyone
The housing shortage, more than any other difficulty,
hits young painters and sculptors very hard. For
them, a studio with a wide view, light, and space is
not a luxury but a professional necessity. Despite the
efforts of various committees, the generally sympathetic
attitude of the Municipality of Paris, and the goodwill of
the public authorities, there are countless young artists in
Paris without a studio. To buy one in the centre of the
capital, at Montparnasse for instance, is naturally
beyond the means of a beginner with no private income.
The average price even of something quite modest is 2
or 3 million francs.
Those who have been renting studios for some years
are the best off in this respect. In one artists' colony,
the rent is not more than 25,000 francs (£25) a year, but
what discomfort, to say the least: no running water,
erratic heating, a leaking roof and cracked walls. These
studios, known to be unhealthy, are to be knocked down
by an estate agency which plans to build flats on
the site. Where and how can the present occupants be
rehoused? Rents today, if one happens to find a studio,
are as high as 40,000 francs a month in one street in the
Montparnasse district!
Painters and sculptors who are obliged to live in a hotel,
a furnished room or an attic, can no longer hope to live
on credit for weeks or months, as artists were once able
to do in the years preceding the great slump
of 1930. In the world today, people have
scant admiration for the Bohemian Ufe. In
restaurants, the artist pays his bill like
everyone else. If he is not a student, or

PARIS IS RECOGNIZED at the capital of the world of art. That is why successful foreign artists consider it important to exhibit their works
there. The majority of artists who come to study only remain for a few months, and few actually settle. One who has done so Is Reginald Weston,
(above) a Londoner, who, though he has been painting since he was a child, has never had any formal art training. A former waiter, sailor and
journalist, Weston became a professional painter when he arrived in Paris in 1947. Since then he has employed a new art technique : mural dec¬
orations on laminated plastic. The artist paints directly on to a sheet of paper which Is subjected to high pressure and becomes part of the plastic.

stereotype of the artist as
a Bohemian character no

is no longer a student, he can count only on a few hostels,
which are almost always, private benevolent institutions.
In any case, the artist no longer tries to appear as a figure
apart. Eccentric clothing is no longer the fashion. In the
streets or in cafés, it may be possible to recognize painters
and sculptors by a particular style, a free and easy
manner or a certain unconventionality, but they are
generally dressed like everyone else.
The attitude of young artists today is in fact more
positive than that of the previous generation. They talk
readily about social security, from which they would like
to benefit, and about the comfort and healthy conditions
at which they are aiming. They are capable of tackling
technical problems, such as the building of a studio or
the planning of an artists' colony. They are competent
in defending their rights and those of their squatter
friends, and can carry on a well-informed discussion
about the clauses of a contract. They are very eager for
material success, which is more attractive to them than
the romantic picture of poverty-stricken genius resorting
to the bottle.
Their psychological and mental balance is a matter of
concern to them and they fully realize that alcohol and
drugs are not necessary to the development of their art.
There are definite reasons for their anxiety and nervous
tension. Probably their difficulties are not much greater
24
than those of their predecessorsfor never has there been
such a demand for paintings as today (for once, specula¬
tion has had a salutary effect!)since they know that
they have a good chance of making a living by their art
at the age of about thirty-five, providing that they work
hard. But they are more alive to the difficulties than
artists used to be, precisely because they feel that theirs
is a real career and because they wish to have the rights
and responsibilities of citizenship.
The feeling of unity among painters is coming, more
and more, to resemble the collective spirit of workers'
trade unions. The modern artist, who is. more serious-
minded than his predecessors, is far less addicted to
rowdyism; his spare time is devoted more often to cultural
pursuits than to roistering. But precisely because he no
longer holds aloof from society, he is subject to social
pressures and to the idea of social standing. He wants to
succeed, hut fortunately without losing all his good
humour and gaiety; he is often more reflective than his
predecessors and sometimes suffers from loneliness.
In short, the young artist, whether he be a bachelor or a
married man with a family, unknown or already enjoy¬
ing a reputation, has definitely adopted a more bourgeois
way of life, and ambitions and reactions which conform
to it. Nor does he seem to have escaped the general pro¬
cess which is "uniformizing" men almost everywhere.

Advent of European civilization in Argentina created a remarkable change in the country's flora which now includes useful trees and plants from every
part of the world, including, for example, the Australian eucalyptus, planted in many places and thriving on the pampa. Photos of the paloborracho

Forests are one of the world's most valuable primary
resources. Apart from the important raw materials
obtained from them, well distributed woodlands are
essential to agriculture. They protect crop lands by
giving shelter, conserving the soil and its fertility,
regulating the climate and water supply, and controlling
rivers and streams. Wherever trees have vanished from
the scene the soil has been badly impoverished and, in
due time, desert has replaced fertile lands.
The forests of North America, which are today exploited
on a considerable scale for timber and pulpwood, are even
more important for the role they play in controlling the
great watersheds of that continent. There, as in the
U.S.S.R., new forests are being established not primarily
for timber production but as a protective measure, to
increase fertility and assist agriculture on the adjacent
lands.
In past centuries man has recklessly felled the forests,
or allowed them to be destroyed in other ways, without
thought of replanting them. Trees once grew so
abundantly over the earth's surface that it might well
have seemed as if they were inexhaustible. But most of
Europe's primary forests have disappeared, and the only
forests still left virtually untouched in the Northern
Hemisphere are the vast stands in Siberia which are
remote from land communications or the sea.
History can provide many examples of the disastrous
results of forest clearance. The Sahara and other deserts
of North Africa and the Near East were once upon a time
well forested, green and fertile. Of the once-famous
cedars of Lebanon few are left today. The sal forest
along the Jumna River of Northern India where, as
history records, the Emperor Baber hunted jungle beasts
some four centuries ago, has completely disappeared
leaving waterless ravines In its place. Destruction of
forest cover in the Himalayas produced its ill effects
hundreds of miles away.
Today only about one-fifth of the whole land area of
Asia is forest, compared with one-third or more in North
America and the U.S.S.R. and only slightly less in Europe
and Africa. Moreover, Asia's forests are very unevenly
distributed, a fact which has contributed to the low living
standards of its peoples. While Far Eastern lands are
generally well endowed with forest, there are large areas
in the Near East, in China and parts of India and
Pakistan where there is little or no tree growth at all.
Within the last century nations have
come to realise the folly of abusing and
misusing the forests. More timber is being
felled over the world than ever before, but
most countries now have rational forest
policies with the two-fold aim of increasing

FOREST WEALTH
(Continued)
the yield per acre of forest produce while at the same
time preserving determined areas of protective woodland.
This is achieved mainly in two ways; by the regeneration
of existing forests and by the planting of new ones usually
with faster-growing softwoods that yield the most useful
timber in good quantity. The overall aim must be to
achieve a just balance of the use of land for forestry and
for agriculture and building development. Provided they
are managed with skill and knowledge and over-cutting
is avoided, forests can play their dual roles in perpetuity.
Many Far East countries have well-established and
well-organized forest services. In India and Pakistan,
for example, these were set up in the latter part of the
last century, and though the march of the desert has been
halted, a vast amount needs to be done in those countries
before the wasted forests can be anything like restored.
Since the war a Near East Forestry Commission has been
brought into being by
the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the
United Nations (FAO)
to work out policies for,
and discuss the prob¬
lems involved in, estab¬
lishing new plantations
and ensuring their pro¬
tection in that tree-
starved region of the
world.
If forests are to be de¬
veloped and utilized to
the best advantage in
the future, it is neces¬
sary to obtain a reason¬
ably accurate and com¬
prehensive knowledge of
their resources and how
they change according
to growth and fellings.
Although the forests
have had a tremendous
influence upon the de¬
velopment of civilization,
surprisingly little has
been Iknown in detail of
their resources up to
now. Forest inventories
have been purely local.
The first inventory of
the world's forests was
undertaken in 1947-48 by
FAO, which asked all
member countries to
supply their most recent
available data. Realis¬
ing the need to repeat
such an enquiry at inter¬
vals, the Sixth Session of
the FAO Conference, in
1951, recommended that
the Organization should,
every five years, collect
and publish all the
available information
on world forests. Accord¬
ingly, a second and much fuller inventory was made
in 1953, and the third is now in preparation (1). The 1953
inventory gives the most detailed picture of the extent of
the world's forests ever published, though, inevitably, it -is
still a long way from whatAs desired. It represents a pro¬
gress report on the advances in forest consciousness,
forest management and forest statistics.
Nearly 30 per cent of the world's land surface is
covered by forest, though less than one-third of this is

INCREASING MECHANIZATION Is the keynote of U.S.S.R.'s lumber
industry. Logging operations have been 90 per cent mechanized over the
past decade or so. Here a special auto-loader transports a load of planks
to waiting trucks at a sawmill. Other specially designed trucks and transport
vehicles nowadays carry finished planks to railway stations and canal docks.
being exploited. Present consumption of coniferous or
softwood timber roughly balances the net growth. But
in the case of the broadleaved or hardwood trees only
about 75 per cent of the net annual growth is felled, due
largely to the fact that many species in the tropical and
sub-tropical forests are not marketed. The 1953 inventory
showed that the world's forests are, in the words of that
report, "'theoretically capable of furnishing a plentiful
flow of forest products for a world population much
higher than that of today/'
Nevertheless, timber supply problems arise in various
countries because, as we have seen, forests are not evenly
distributed and, secondly, underdeveloped lands, such as
Africa or Latin-America, have not so far had the means
to exploit their great forest wealth. Good progress is
being made with this last problem, though it is obvious
that its solution must take time.
Meanwhile Africa im¬
ports timber from the
better managed forests
of Europe even though
Europe actually has far
less forest per head of
population than Africa.
In North America the
great progress with for¬
est road building and
up-to-date logging me¬
thods has considerably
enlarged the area of ex¬
ploitable forest, while
the countries of Latin-
America lag well be¬
hind. In Peru, for
example, it is cheaper
to import Douglas fir
all the way from the
Pacific coast of the U.S.
and Canada than com¬
mercial hardwoods from
the much nearer Ama¬
zon and Orinoco valleys.
The great bulk of all
the timber used nowa¬
days is softwood (for
newsprint, carpentry,
etc.), the product of the
evergreen coniferous
forests which represent
just over one half of the
world's exploited forests.
Such forests stretch in a
broad belt right across
the Northern Hemi¬
sphere, from the U.S.S.R.
(containing more than
half of all the coniferous
stands), across Scandi¬
navia, the Baltic coun¬
tries, Scotland and,
beyond the Atlantic
Ocean, across Canada to
the Rockies and then
along the Pacific coast
from Alaska south to
California. Within this great belt are more than 90 per
cent of the world's softwood growth.
The wider distribution of coniferous forests over the
world is needed to solve problems of timber supplies in
the future. This is already being done as, for example,
by the introduction on a large scale of North American
and European species into the Southern Hemisphere which
is so poorly endowed with native softwoods. One species

UNTAPPED WOOD RESERVES. The Amazon Basin covers one-third of Brazil yet barely supports one twentieth of the population. Future
development of this area must include scientific exploitation of its rich forests. If properly developed the forests of Latin America could contribute
greatly to the world timber output. Above, at a' sawmill on an Amazon tributary a crane stacks logs which have been brought from the river.
A TEN-YEAR PICTURE OF WORLD'S TIMBER OUTPUT
Output of timber from the world's forests showed steady
expansion in the 10-year period 1946-1955, FAO has
just revealed. Except for a slight decline between the
years 1951 and 1953, the total timber harvest increased
throughout the post-war decade, with a particularly rapid rate
of growth in the U.S.S.R. the Pacific area and Asia.
These developments are highlighted in a new FAO publica¬
tion, World Forest Products Statistics, A Ten-Year Summary,
1946-1955, which gives figures on timber removals, production
of forest products and world trade from more than 150
countries and territories. It is considered the most complete
and authoritative report yet published for the post-war period
in the field of forest product statistics.
Some highlights from the report:
Plywood, the increasingly versatile building material, had a
phenomenal expansion in production, from just over three
million cubic metres at the beginning of the period to almost
11 million cubic metres at the end (leading producing countries
in 1955 were the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada,
Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany).
The woodpulp industry was dominated by North America
and the three Northern European countries: Finland, Norway
and Sweden. North America produced 70 percent of the total
world volume in 1946, with a decline to 60 percent in 1955.
Rapidly increasing woodpulp production was reported from
Africa, Asia and the Pacific area.
In newsprint production, North America and Europe
continued to lead all other regions, but the rate of development
in the Pacific Area and in Asia was outstanding. Canada was
the leading newsprint-exporting country with 79 percent of
total world shipments in 1955.
About 91 percent of the 1955 production of paperboard
came from North America and Europe, and these two regions
were the leading producers throughout the decade. The fastest
rate of growth in production was reported from Asia, followed
by the U.S.S.R., but largest increase in volume of output
5.2 million tons was in North America.

FOREST WEALTH (Continued)
South Africa. In each case the Insignis Pine has done
better in its adopted territories than in its native envi¬
ronment.
An outstandingly successful softwood planting pro¬
gramme was undertaken in New Zealand between the
World Wars, when nearly half a million acres of exotic
conifers were planted mainly on the formerly bare
volcanic plains in the centre of the North Island. Those
vast unproductive plains were once a challenge in such a
well cultivated country as New Zealand. The success
with which her forestry pioneers met that challenge is
evident today in the 200,000 acre Kaingaroa State Forest
the largest man-made forest on earth which gave birth
to a great new pulp and paper-making industry.
Climate and soil conditions in New Zealand proved
extremely favourable to the rapid growth of commercial
softwoods. While a variety of conifer species from Europe
and North America went towards the creation of the new
forests, the most successful of them all was the Insignis
Pine. This one species now covers more than 60 per cent
of the total acreage of New Zealand's softwood plantations.
Scientific research, like scientific management, plays a
key role in modern forestry practice. Pre-planting
experiments with soils and seeds in the forest nurseries
make certain that only the types of trees best suited to
local conditions are selected for new plantations. Sample
plot work is vital to the successful establishment of new
plantations with fast-growing- conifers of high timber
yield. Even these trees take a good many years to reach
maturity so the forester must gain advance knowledge
of the kind of stock and cultivation methods that will
achieve the best results. Extensive research is undertaken
also to combat timber pests and diseases, to develop better
methods of fire control in the woods, and to determine
the commercial properties of unmarketed timbers.
The changeover from manual to mechanical methods
of logging, together with the construction of better access
and transport roads, is reflected in the progress of opening
28
up new forest areas in many countries. In the five years
between the first and second FAO inventories, the
accessible forest area in Ghana, Nigeria and Thailand, for
example, was increased by one-fifth; in Austria, British
Honduras and Greece it was up by about one-tenth. In
the U.S.S.R. logging operations have been 90 per cent
mechanized over the past decade or so, and it is estimated
that more than half the huge forest area of the Soviet
Union is now accessible and can be economically exploited.
In a Far East country such as Malaya, where the forests
.are a repository of great material wealth, a major obstacle
to development has been the lack of roads. This made
the removal of felled timber from some of the best areas
a difficult and costly operation. The Malayan Forest
Department, like similar forest services in many parts of
the world today, therefore has built up an effective
mechanized road-making unit which now operates widely
over the Peninsula.
The exploitation of Latin-America's rich forest resources
requires the development of road and rail communications
and the introduction of modern logging and milling
techniques. This, in turn, calls for trained forest workers
and managers. Progress has certainly been made in
recent years to establish forestry as a progressive
economic activity in Latin-America. There, as in other
underdeveloped regions, the U.S. Technical Assistance
Programme is co-operating with the United Nations
development programme. A definite step forward was
taken in 1948 when a Latin-American Forestry Commission
was set up. Schools of forestry have also been established
at universities in Chile and Venezuela.
In the years ahead the enormous wealth of the forests
in South America will surely not only be utilized to meet
the timber requirements of that continent, but will
contribute generously to the needs of distant and populous
lands which are deprived of such valuable resources.
No other region in the world offers such unlimited
opportunities for forest development in the remainder of
this century.

over to mechanical methods of logging and construction of roads giving access to forests have led to opening up of new areas. More than half the
huge forest area of the Soviet Union Is now accessible and can be economically exploited. Top photo, logs from the Carpathian forests of the Ukraine

Mapping Milestone
THE NEW
ATLAS OF
THE SKIES
by A.J. Branston
THE 'BIG SCHMIDT' TELESCOPE (left)
was used by scientists at Mount' Palomar
Observatory, U.S.A., to map the universe.
This remarkable camera can reach out some
600 million light-years into space to take
photographs of a hitherto unknown sharpness
and clarity. Top photos, an exploding star
or nova caught by the Sky Survey flares in

n observatories all over
the world astronomers
are examining excit¬
edly the "pages" of a
new sky atlas such as
the world has never
seen before a superb
map of the heavens
which is already revealing secrets of
the universe. Undertaken by the Na¬
tional Geographic Society (U.S.A.)
and the California Institute of Tech¬
nology, the atlas is-*the first section
of a giant map of the universe, the
result of some seven years of intensive
work.
It was in 1949 that astronomers at
Palomar Observatory (operated by the
California Institute of Technology)
began work on this Sky Surveythe
most ambitious project of its its kind
ever undertaken which, if successful,
would answer problems and mysteries
of the universe transcending anything
man has ever imagined.
Intriguingly, the results of this in¬
tensive study are already posing new
queries, while the answers to others
seem tantalisingly close. "We regard
the Sky Atlas as a mapping milestone",
stated Dr. John Oliver La Gorce,
president of the National Geographic
Society. "It will yield inestimable
advances in astronomical knowledge."
Among the famous astronomers who
have worked on the atlas are Dr. Al¬
bert H. Wilson, formerly of Mount
Palomar and now Director of the
Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, Ari¬
zona; Dr. Lyman J. Briggs, Chairman
of the research committee of the Na¬
tional Geographic Society; and Dr.
Ira S. Bowen, Director of Palomar and
Mount Wilson Observatories.
Portrait of creation
by a telescopic 'eye'
Above all else one special piece of
optical equipment the "Big
Schmidt" telescopehas brought
reality to the astronomers' dreams by
making it possible to photograph the
heavens to a hitherto unprecedented
depth in space 600 million light
years. In reality Big Schmidt is a
huge camera, named after its designer
Dr. Bernhard Schmidt, a German
optical specialist. It has a wide-
aperture lens measuring 48-inches
across and a reflecting mirror of
72-inches. It is a superb camera,
penetrating with high fidelity ten
times deeper into the heavens and
covering a space volume a thousand
times greater than any ever touched
in previous attempts to chart the
skies photographically. These quali¬
ties enable it to take pictures of
hitherto unknown sharpness and cla¬
rity at enormous distances. A "light-
year" is the distance light travels in
one year roughly six million million
miles. The Big Schmidt can reach
out some 600 million light-years to
obtain its pictures.
Yet, originally, this wonderful tele¬
scope was not designed specifically as
a '"camera" but rather as a "scouting
instrument" for the mighty 200-inch
Hale telescope at Palomar Observa¬
tory. But in the Sky Survey it was
soon found that the 48-inch Big
Schmidt was of paramount impor¬
tance. With its wide-angle reflector,
its telescopic "eye" recorded on
supersensitive film all visible objects
in great cone-shaped slices of space,
reaching out to an average distance
of 2,000 billion billion miles. It
accomplished in a few years a task
for which the "mightier" 200-inch
Hale telescope would have needed
10,000 years or so, though the latter
"sees" about three times as far.
Exploding stars far
brighter than the sun
Yet the Hale is vital too, for when
the Big Schmidt discovers some
unusual phenomena they are
studied intensively by the Hale tele¬
scope. The immense scope of the
work may be better visualized when it
is known that the new sky atlas will
keep astronomers all over the world
busy studying the results for an
estimated 50 to 100 years.
The work undertaken with the aid
of the Big Schmidt would have been
completed sooner but for the limita¬
tions imposed by weather conditions.
It is, naturally, impossible to photo¬
graph the skies on overcast or moon¬
lit nights, or when there is a good
deal of cloud interference. When
conditions are suitable the Big
Schmidt goes into action, but even
then it is possible to obtain (usually)
only four matching pairs of red and
blue photographic plates a night.
Each section of the sky is photo¬
graphed on 14-inch photographic pla¬
tes through red and blue filters. For a
blue exposure about 30 minutes are
needed, for a red approximately an
hour. This "'double" exposure re¬
veals more clearly the colour, tempe¬
rature and brilliance of distant stars,
and moreover will enable astronomers
to learn more about the "'novae" and
"supernovae" those stars that sud¬
denly and inexplicably explode and
swiftly burn themselves out amid a
brightness estimated to be millions of
times greater than that of the sun.
In all, nearly three-quarters of the
sky visible from Palomar have been
photographed and recorded.
What mysteries and secrets of the
universe will this new atlas help our
astronomers to solve? It is difficult
to say, of course, but among mysteries
which have long excited the earth's
astronomers are these:
How old are the stars? Are they
ageless, or are some continually being
born while others die?
How old is the universe and how
big?
The Unesco Courier. April 1958
Do celestial systems hurtling out¬
ward eventually reach the speed of
light and disappear from view for
ever?
Does space curve somewhere out on
the edge of the vast stretches of the
universe or is it boundless?
What is the power which operates
the universe?
What causes those gigantic explo¬
sions that astronomers have seen
from time to time both in the Milky
Way and in the nebulae millions of
miles further into space?
What is the true source of cosmic
rays?
How many suns are there in the
heavens? One expert put forward
the theory that all the grains of sand
on every beach in the world would
not equal the number of suns in the
heavens!
Almost from the beginning of the
survey astounding discoveries have
been made. In 1950, for instance,
the discovery of two new dwarf
stellar systems in the Constellation of
Leo was announced. The importance
of a discovery of this nature is best
understood by an astronomer, but in
simplest terms such a find will (it is
expected) help to throw new light on
the stability, and perhaps even the
evolution of nebulae (cloud-like
clusters of far-distant stars). Up to
this time, the smallest known galaxies
were estimated to possess a diameter
of about 3,000 light-years; the smaller
of the new discoveries is estimated to
have a diameter of only 1,500 light-
years, which suggests that perhaps
even smaller stellar systems exist.
Galaxies two billion
light-years away
Then, in 1951, came the announce¬
ment of a much more startling
discovery, namely, that there are
at least 800 (later amended to over
1,000) clusters of nebulae in the
heavens, as compared with the twenty
known prior to the survey. These
clusters are great masses of stars and
gas, some as far as 350 million light-
years away, which are dotted about
space. The existence of most of them
was only suspected until revealed by
the survey.
But the most revolutionary discov¬
ery of all was made by Dr. Walter
Baade, early in 1953. Working at
Palomar, Dr. Baade found that,
contrary to scientific belief, all stellar
systems beyond the earth's own
galaxy (the Milky Way) are twice as
far away as previously believed. The
most distant galaxies visible through
the 200-inch Hale teles¬
cope, Dr. Baade disco¬
vered, are two billion
light-years away, and
not one billion as
hitherto thought.

THE NEW ATLAS
OF THE SKIES
(Continued)
What is the significance of this
discovery? The observable universe
has a volume eight times as great as
believed, while its age is put at four
billion years rather than two billion.
In turn this means that the Sky
Survey is exploring a volume of space
eight times greater than planned!
Many other discoveries have been,
and will continue to be, made. New
aggregations of stars and systems of
stars, nebulae like the Milky Way,
are almost a daily discovery. Of the
Milky Way itself much new informa¬
tion has been added. In shape it is
now seen as a great flat wheel of stars,
slowly spinning in space, with "arms"
of stars, gas and dust spiralling off
its rim.
Vast dust clouds afloat
in the Milky Way
Dr. Baade believes stars may be
separated into two classes, of
which one class (which he calls
Population I) is being found in the
regions of vast dust clouds floating in
the Milky Way. The other class (Popu¬
lation II) is, he says, concentrated
heavily in the hub of the galaxy's
giant wheel, and probably consists of
old, stable Buns, while those of the
first class are comparatively young.
In all, millions of new stars in
the Milky Way estimated at about
200,000,000,000have already been
revealed by the sky atlas.
The foregoing is but a microscopic
fragment of new knowledge about
the universe which the sky atlas has
already revealed. Equivalent in size
to about 20 very fat volumes, the
completed sky atlas will comprise
1,758 photomaps. The first section
of the atlas is in the form of 14-inch
unbound prints, totalling about 200
sky charts. Overall cost of one
printing and handling only, and
omitting all other expenses involved,
will be about £712 ($2,000) per copy-
clearly one of the most expensive
atlases ever produced. By 1959, it is
planned, all sections of the atlas will
have been printed and despatched to
the hundred or so observatories which
have ordered it.
With its aid, perhaps we shall
learn how large creation really is.
We may even learn whether the
universe is of uniform structure, and
whether it had a definite beginning;
in space and time? Perhaps, also, we
may discover whether the universe
will end one day, or simply go on.

REVOLUTIONARY DISCOVERIES were made with the Big Schmidt telescope during the
Sky Survey. One scientist, Dr. Walter Baade, found that contrary to previous scientific belief, all
stellar systems beyond the earth's own galaxy (The Milky Way) are twice as far away as previously
believed. Above, Dr. Baade examines negatives taken by the Big Schmidt. With him is Dr. Albert
G. Wilson, formerly of Palomar and now Director of the Lowell Observatory, at Flagstaff, Arizona.

ANDROMEDA NEBULA, photographed with the Schmidt telescope, ¡s a great spiral nebula
and one of the nearest neighbours in space to the earth's galaxy. Even so it is barely visible to
the naked eye, being some 820,000 light-years from the earth. It is a giant among galaxies and
contains stars, dust, gas clouds and numerous star clusters. The two diffused spots, one above the
centre of the spiral (round) and one below (elongated) are companions of the Andromeda Nebula.

Letters to the Editor
A PLEA FOR THE GOAT
Sir,
In your January 1958 issue (Man
Against Nature) a very interesting
number, by the way was a most sur¬
prising article. All those preceding it
deal with the protection of animals
threatened with extinction and aim to
show the value of creating reserves to
protect animals, certain of which are
sometimes to be feared. The article I
am referring to ("The Gentle Little
Goat") seems to have no connexion
with the rest.
In it we read of the extensive damage
caused by goats, but on the contrary
very little is said about the animal's
economic value in poverty-stricken re¬
gions. You give many examples of
birds, reptiles, etc. which have no appa¬
rent usefulness, but which in fact do
good indirectly. I feel the goat should
be included among them.
Don't let us remove the goat from our
planet and thus add it to the ever¬
growing list of animal fossils. Let us
also remember that despite the damage
it does, the goat also contributes a great
deal to Nature. You have only to
follow a herd of goats along the moun¬
tain trails in order to realize this.
P. Vialla
Aurcilhan, France
Ed. note: In reply to this correspon¬
dent, M. Raymond Furon, author of the
article on goats, writes: It is gratifying
to discover that out of many thousands
of readers, only one protested against
my indictment of the goat for the devas¬
tation it causes. The International
Union for the Conservation of Nature
and Natural Resources (in whose work I
take an active part) strives to protect ani¬
mals which are either useful or rare, but
never to bring about an increase in the
number of harmful animals. I am
aware of the dangers inherent in
changing the balance of Nature, but I
don't think it is dangerous to destroy
Tse-tse flies or mosquito carriers of
epidemic diseases. I know it is said,
that sleeping sickness, malaria and
yellow fever play a beneficent role by
keeping down the size of populations
which are poor and unable to produce
enough food for themselves, but even
so, I consider that Tse-tse flies and mos¬
quitoes are harmful and should be des¬
troyed.
You talk to me of goats ; let me
counter with rabbits. The rabbit is a
delightful animal and I myself have
never killed a single one. But it is
equally true that this is an animal to be
feared and that the benefits of the epi¬
demics of myxomatosis have been hailed
with satisfaction by agronomists and
forest experts throughout the world.
The rabbit is a harmful animal and its
relatively complete disappearance is sim¬
ply a source of annoyance for some
hunters and cartridge manufacturers.
I know quite well that poor countries
use the goat for its milk and its skin,
but I deplore the fact that its presence
is tolerated in precisely these proverty-
stricken countries because the damage it
causes by far exceeds the resources it
provides. The disappearance of vege¬
tation and the erosion of the soil which
inevitably follows are mortal dangers
for peoples who are incapable of com¬
prehending the present situation and
still less of foreseeing that of tomorrow.
The goat is not a useful animal, not
even a "neutral" one; it is a very harm¬
ful beast. Undeniable proof has come
from studies in islands which were once
covered by forests and arable land, but
which are now bare and deserted solely
through the depredations of goats. If
you are the owner of a goat, my dear
sir, make sure it can't get loose.
Sir,
Regarding the article, "The Gentle
Little Goat", I should like to tell you
that you may add Yugoslavia to the list
of countries which have outlawed this
animal. The decision to exterminate
the goats was taken in 1947 and was put
into effect during the next two years.
It has already produced remarkable
results. In the mountainous parts of
Montenegro, Macedonia and in Dalma-
tia, many areas which were once almost
stripped bare are now covered with
luxuriant vegetation.
M. Kalanovic
Belgrade, Yugoslavia
Sir,
I consider that the keeping of goats
among flocks of sheep should be for¬
bidden in the Mediterranean area. You
may, by the way, be interested to know
that colonies of beavers still live in the
lower Rhone Valley, on the banks of
the river and along certain of its tribu¬
taries such as the Ceze and the Tave.
Maurice Faurc
\ Laudun, France
Sir,
Congratulations on your recent issue
(January 1958) on The Protection of
Nature. Like many other people, we
try, in a small way, to inculcate this
idea in the minds of the young people
who belong to our centre. However we
should like to do more and we wonder
whether any organization could help us
through the loan of films, exhibits and
other means of information.

Alliance against pests :
Twenty-three countries now belong
to the European and Mediterranean
Organization for the Protection of
Plants, which works to save food
crops from the ravages of insect and
animal pests. Enemy N° 1 is still the
Colorado toeetle, the destroyer of
potato crops, and another battle is
being waged against a species of louse
which attacks fruit trees. The Or¬
ganization's principal target in 1958,
however, is the rat.
WORLD WEATHER ROUND-UP:
Weather observations made during
the first half of the International
Geophysical Year are now being
received, sifted and classified at
the special report centre set up in
Geneva by the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization. Some 2,000
land stations, including robot ob¬
servation posts parachuted into
remote areas, are gathering infor¬
mation. Weather reports made
during the entire I.G.Y. programme
will be published on some 18,500
microcards, fitting into 16 drawers
of standard size card catalogue
cabinets.
II ARNESSING THE WIND : Wind
measuring gauges are being planted
in fifteen sites in Uruguay to deter¬
mine the most suitable places for
setting up wind-driven electric power
plants. Sites were chosen by British
scientist Edward W. Golding, one of
the world's leading windpower auth¬
orities, who was sent by Unesco to
advise the Uruguayan Government
on plans to harness the wind. Most
power supplies in Uruguay's cattle
country today come from Diesel gene¬
rators expensive because of fuel
transport costs. Introducing windmill
generators would bring down power
costs and leave the Diesels to take
over on windless days.
7,500 BOOKS A MINUTE: A total
of 1,100,000,000 volumes was pub¬
lished during 1957 in the Soviet
Union in the 85 languages used
within its borders. This represents
an output of 7,500 books a minute.
Most widely-read foreign authors
in the U.S.S.R. are French writers,
with Victor Hugo and Jules Verne
topping the list. Favourite Ameri¬
can writers with Russian readers
are Jack London, O'Henry, Theo¬
dore Dreiser and Mark Twain.
Most popular British authors are
Dickens, H.G.Wells, Daniel Defoe,
Swift, Galsworthy and Shake¬
speare.
IJlINDERWATER FARMING: Mass
production of a new artificial food
from Chlorella, an alga that grows in
ponds, has been started by the Japan
Chlorella Research Institute in To¬
kyo. Chlorella is highly nutritious
and cheap to produce. The cells exist
in any pond in large quantities and
their growth by division into small
cells is extremely rapid. Able to use
more light energy than crops occupy¬
ing the same area, Chlorella is at the
mercy of the weather only as regards
light.
MORE EQUALITY FOR MORE:
Progress is being made in many
parts of the world to ensure that
men and women doing work of
value shall receive equal pay,
reports the International Labour
Organization (Ilo). In New Zea¬
land, for example, the gap between
respective wage rates is "steadily
closing". In Japan, women workers
in the Tokyo Police Board's traffic
section have similar pay and pro¬
motion to men employees. Noting
that discrimination still exists, the
Ilo report says where improve¬
ments have taken place they have
come from government action,
supported by employers, trade
unions and women's organizations.
AiSIA IN THE LIMELIGHT:
Plays about Asia or written by Asians
were in the limelight in the United
States last month officially designat¬
ed as International Theatre Month.
The U.S. National Commission for
Unesco, the American Educational
Theatre Assocation and the National
Theatre Arts Council chose Asia as
the theme in connexion with Unesco's
Major Project to develop better mu¬
tual appreciation of the cultural
values of East and West.
'JAMBOREE - ON - THE - AIR':
Boy scouts all over the world will
take part in a "Jamboree-on-the-
Air" on May 10 and 11. Radio ama¬
teurs of the Scout Movement are
invited to make contact with each
other on amateur wavebands from
midnight on Friday, May 9 to mid¬
night on Sunday, May 11 (local
times). The idea for the radio
"Jamboree" follows the success of
the amateur shortwave radio sta¬
tion set up at the Jubilee Jamboree
in the United Kingdom last year
when contact was made with over
80 countries.
TiHEATRE OF THE NATIONS:
On March 25 the curtain went up at
the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris
on The Theatre of the Nations. This
year's four-month international seas¬
on promises to toe one of the most
important so far, with dramatic,
operatic and ballet groups from
19 countries offering the public a
choice of 40 different productions.
The programme is divided into three
main cycles: dramatic performances
to be inaugurated by the National
Theatre of Athens with four classical
Greek tragedies; a ballet cycle headed
by the American Ballet Theatre of
New York; and an operatic cycle in¬
troduced by the Berlin State Opera.
H GLOBAL WAR ON MALARIA:
Over $n million are going to be .
spent on the World Health Orga¬
nization's campaign for malaria
eradication throughout the world
this year compared with $8 million
in 1957. Of this total, nearly
$8 million will come from Unicef
funds and over $5 million from the
special Who Malaria Fund. In the
global attack on malaria, nine
countries with a total population
of 231 million have succeeded in
wiping out the disease almost com¬
pletely. In large areas of seven
other lands (population 43 million)
eradication is well advanced and
operations are under way in an¬
other 44 countries, with a total
of 302 million inhabitants.
ShrTUDY TOUR FOR STEELMEN:
Rumanian workers from metallurgical
industries visited France last month
under a Unesco travel grant scheme
for workers' exchanges, to study and
compare operations in French in¬
stallations and learn something of the
everyday lives of France's workers.
Besides looking around foundries and
electrical machinery works, the party
visited a technical training centre,
was shown safety measures in metal
working plants and visited a workers'
rest house and an adult education
centre.

World view of
translations
The publication of 27,617 translations
of books in 52 countries is recorded in
the new annual edition of Index Transla¬
tionum just issued by Unesco. In its
1958 and ninth edition, this authoritative
reference work' again affords a world¬
wide view of the extent and variety of
inter-lingual diffusion of books. Most of
the translations listed were published
during 1956, and the total exceeds that
of the previous edition which was 24,274.
A convenient table gives the figures by
subject-category and by country. This
shows that more than half of the transla¬
tions 14,692were in the literature
classification. The second highest group
figure is the 3,21 I for law, social science
and education; the third for history,
geography and biography, with applied
sciences in fourth place.
(For details of world's ten most trans¬
lated authors, see page I 0).
The greatest number of translations per
country recorded in the book is 4,648
published in the U.S.S.R., including a
great number in the different languages of
the country. Germany is second, with
2,152. Other big translators are Italy
(1,428), France (1,399), Czechoslovakia
(1, 386), Turkey (1,365), and Japan (1,336).
In 694 pages, Index Translationum presents
the result of intensive work by biblio¬
graphers and librarians of many countries
in such scope that it lists translations
in 195 languages, ranging fromAbkhaz,
the language of the Soviet Republic on the
Black Sea, to Zulu.

olves special
problems. When thé children can attend normal State schools provision must
be made for their particular needs, including, for example, a wider disciplinary
tolerance and the relaxation of strict time-tables to avoid any sense of con¬
finement. When the children are on the move all year round, schools must
travel with the caravans. Public authorities and private organizations in nu¬
merous countries are now tackling these problems. Caravan classroom, above,
is installed on a camping site near Paris where gypsies spend the winter. (See p. 4)
