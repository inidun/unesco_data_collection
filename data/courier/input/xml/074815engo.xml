Athena in Rome
The goddess Athena, who
according to ancient
mythology sprang fully
grown and armed from
the forehead of Zeus, lord
of the gods, gave her
name to the Greek
capital. She is said to
have presented the city
with the olive, symbol of
prosperity and especially
of peace. This terra¬
cotta bust of Athena
wearing her traditional
helmet dates from the
middle of the 6th century
B.C. and was unearthed
in Rome. The figure,
which bears traces of
polychrome paint, was
discovered in the
foundations of the church
of Sant 'Omobono on the-
site of the former Forum
Boarium (cattle market)
near the Capitol.

preserve and restore these masterpieces of
classical Greek architecture and sculpture.
This issue of the Unesco Courier is devoted
to a study of the Acropolis from ancient
times to the present day. Cover shows the

The Acropolis of Athens, site of one of the world's
most famous groups of ancient monuments, rises
up in the midst of modern buildings in the Greek
capital. Also known as the Holy Rock, the
Acropolis takes its name from the Greek words
akros (upper) and polis (city). It was already a
centuries-old sanctuary in the 5th century B.C.,
when the great Athenian statesman Pericles
launched the grandiose building programme whose
remains are still admired today. Easily identifiable
in this rare aerial view (see also page 18) are the
Parthenon (large rectangular building in centre); the
Erechtheum (left of Parthenon); and the Propylaea
and the Temple of Athena Nike (group of buildings
at left of photo). Clearly visible at foot of hill are
two ancient theatres: the Odeon (left) and the
Theatre of Dionysus (right).
During a ceremony held in the Parthenon, Athens, on 10
January 1977, Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General
of Unesco, launched an international campaign to save the
historic monuments of the Acropolis.
Many of Unesco's Member States have already set an
example of international solidarity in responding to this
appeal. Equally numerous are those which intend to offer the
Greek governmentwhich has decided to assume the costs of
the operationscientific and technical cooperation, especially
in combatting the stone disease that afflicts the marble
monuments and in ensuring the stability of the rock on
which they stand.

THE 40 years which have elapsed
between the eve of World War II
and the present day constitute a
very short period of time in comparison
with the age of Athens, but one which has
been of great significance for the develop¬
ment and appearance of the city.
As far as the Acropolis itself is concern¬
ed, these four decades have passed
without any major changes (the large-
scale works of restoration undertaken by
Nicolas Balanos were completed by 1933),
but they have quietly and relentlessly creat
ed a series of new problems that confront
us today.
These problems, moreover, are so seri¬
ous that there are those who are now
talking of the destruction of the Acropolis,
or at least of serious and irreparable deter¬
ioration of its masterpieces of classical
architecture and sculpture.
The problems are in fact directly related
to the rapid and uncontrolled change in
the environment surrounding the monu¬
ments. The last 40 years have seen enor¬
mous economic, demographic and social
changes in Athens, converting it from a
small peaceful city, full of reminders of its
historical past and well-proportioned neo¬
classical buildings, into a great capital.
In addition to 2 million inhabitants, it has
acquired important industries, tall apart¬
ment blocks, international ports and air¬
ports, together with an increasing amount
of environmental disturbance and pollu¬
tion. Each day increases the alienation of
the urban landscape from the natural ter¬
rain, the landmarks of classical topogra- k
phy, and the remnants of the buildings of Y

antiquity. The famous crystal-clear atmos¬
phere of Attica is covered with a pall of
fumes; while a flood of tourists inundates
the city, and the Acropolis in particular.
The Greek Archeological Service has
always worked, on a limited scale, to pre¬
serve the temples of the Acropolis, but it
was only about 10 years ago that specialists
became fully aware of the new conditions
and problems.
In June 1968, an article in the Unesco
Courier by Georges Dontas, the Director
responsible for the Acropolis, brought the
disquiet felt by Greek archeologists to the
attention of a wider public. Unesco sent
two scientific missions to Athens: a group
of three specialists in 1969, and a photo-
grammetry team from the French National
Geographic Institute in the spring of 1971.
The real work of studying and solving
the problems of the Acropolis, however,
only began in February 1975, with the for¬
mation of a committee and a working
group of specialists, archeologists and
technical experts, and with a generous
allocation of funds for the whole operation!
From the outset there has been lively
public interest in the fate of the monu¬
ments on the Acropolis. The Greeks today
look on these buildings as the most pre¬
cious part of their architectural heritage,
while people the world over consider them
as the finest expression of the classical
spirit of the ancient world.
Both the Greek Government and the
authorities responsible for the Acropolis,
aware of this general interest and of the
responsibility of the scientific community
towards the monuments, began to take
action in earnest two years ago. At the
international level, they appealed for funds
to finance the rescue work, while at the
national level they organized a thorough¬
going study of the dangers threatening
the monuments, in order to eradicate their
causes. Here, too, international help was
sought, and Unesco sent another team of
experts in October 1975.
The problems involved in preserving the
Acropolis and its monuments must be
exhaustively studied before even the small¬
est stone is moved from its place. Further¬
more, any action must respect three basic
principles: the external appearance of the
monuments should be changed as little as
possible; the internationally recognized
provisions of the Charter of Venice should
be fully observed (1); and whatever steps
are taken should not be irreversible.
The Acropolis rock as a whole was inves¬
tigated first by geologists and engineers.
After exhaustive research, they were able
to allay earlier fears that it was unstable or
was being eroded by underground water.
They also showed that both the natural
bedrock and the foundations of the monu¬
ments, with the exception of the Pinako¬
thek (the north wing of the Propylaea) and
the base of the statue of Agrippa, are in a
good state of preservation.
Investigation of the stability of the super¬
structure of the monuments is now in pro¬
gress. All these buildings were constructed
of blocks of white Pentelic marble, so per¬
fectly hewn and fitted together that no
mortar was needed to bind them. Each
building is therefore first examined as a
whole, to detect fatigue as a result of earth¬
quakes and wind pressure, and secondly in
detail, to establish the extent to which its
various components (columns, capitals and
beams) are capable of supporting a wide
range of stresses.
The overall examination of the monu¬
ments includes an experimental study of
the phenomena affecting the Parthenon,
using the modern technique of photoelasti-
city: a 1:100 scale model made of epoxy
resin is subjected to stresses proportionate k
to those affecting the monument itself. Y

Ballooning
to
the rescue
Balloon approaches the Acropolis
(right) on a picture-taking mission.
The photos are to help identify the
hundreds of pieces of masonry
scattered over the site so that
those belonging to the surviving
monuments may be restored to
their original place. Specialists
are also studying the surface rock
itself, which repeated excavations
have deprived of its protective
layer of soil, as can be seen
around the Parthenon (left). The
marble statues of the Acropolis
(below right) have been eroded by
wind and rain for 24 centuries and
in recent years this process has
been greatly accelerated by air
pollution. Sulphur dioxide
spewed out by factories and
central heating systems produces
sooty crusts on the statues (below
left, face of horseman on the
West frieze of the Parthenon) that
subsequently crack the marble.
The Greek government has
clamped down on pollution in the
area surrounding the Acropolis.

k Detailed investigation includes exami¬
nation of the cracks and internal hollows
in the marble caused by earlier fires and
explosions, by means of such modern tech¬
niques as ultrasonic measurements and
gammagraphy.
Both these techniques make it possible
to measure the strength of the structure
without taking samples of the building
material itself. The first involves measuring
the speed at which ultrasonic waves travel
through the marble, and has already been
used on the elements supporting the cof¬
fered ceiling of the west part of the Par¬
thenon.
Gammagraphy, which is being applied to
marble for the first time, involves taking
photographs with gamma rays from a
cobalt source. These rays are capable of
penetrating the marble architectural struc¬
ture and producing a film similar to an
X-ray. These photographs reveal any
cracks and internal fissures in the marble,
and thus allow a diagnosis of the causes of
its weakness to be made.
The most serious cause for concern
about the monuments on the Acropolis is
not, however, connected with their general
stability, but with the cracks which have
been and which are still being caused by
the oxidation of the iron inside the marble
structures.
The ancient Greeks used small iron bolts
and clamps in their architecture, but made
them almost rustproof by coating them
with lead. Nicolas Balanos failed to take
similar precautions with the steel elements
used in his extensive restoration between
1896 and 1933, possibly because he over¬
estimated the properties of steel. Thus,
almost all the buildings on the Acropolis
had bolts inserted into them to join broken
pieces, while steel girders were used, as in
the porch of the Caryatids on the Erech-
theum, to reinforce architraves and ancient
beams.
All these metal parts rust because of the
humidity of Athens and its proximity to the
sea. Rusting not only lowers their resis¬
tance, but also causes the metal to swell
and crack the marble into which it is em¬
bedded. A large number of fissures exist
already, and in some places there is an
immediate danger of collapse.
Thorough investigation has demonstrat¬
ed that the only solution to this exception¬
ally serious problem is to remove all the
steel elements and replace them with bolts
of titanium, a metal that will not rust under
any natural conditions.
Where the plans left by Balanos provide
inadequate information concerning the
position of the steel elements embedded
in the marble, they can be located by
means of gammagraphy.
The steel bolts and beams cannot be
replaced without dismantling and reassem¬
bling all those parts of the monuments on
the Acropolis which have been restored
in the 19th and 20th centuries. A pro¬
gramme as extensive as this, which must
conform with the principles noted above,
requires many years' work, exceptional
organization, and most important of all,
exhaustive preliminary study.
In addition to the compilation of all
available information from bibliographies,
archives and earlier reports on the build-
ings of the Acropolis, minute documen¬
tation of these buildings began two years
ago, including the preparation of photo¬
graphs and detailed drawings of their pre¬
sent form. In the case of the Erechtheum,
this task is approaching completion and
detailed proposals of the measures needed
for the building have almost been finalized.
In producing measured architectural
drawings of the temples on the Acropolis,
the technique of photogrammetry has been
used on a limited scale. More traditional
methods have been preferred which permit
a diagnosis of the state of decay of each
piece of marble, at the same time as the
measurements are taken.
Another cause for alarm is the deterio¬
ration of the marble surfaces and espe-
Decline
and fall
of a
mythical
king
Two legendary figures from Athenian
history, Cecrops and his daughter
Pandrosos, are depicted in this piece of
sculpture from the western pediment of
the Parthenon. According to ancient
myths Cecrops was the first king of
Athens, around the 16th century B.C.
Over the centuries this major work of '
Classical Greek art has suffered extensive
erosion and by 1976 its condition was so
serious that it was lowered from the
pediment (left) and removed to the
Acropolis Museum.

Testing time
for the
Parthenon
Experimental model of the Parthenon (above) was made of
synthetic resin to a scale of 1:100. Its designers hope to
evaluate the stability of the monument and its capacity to
resist wind pressure and possible seismic disturbances.
Specially designed equipment is used to show the simulated
stress patterns in visual form. Below, simulated stresses on

cially the sculpture of almost all the monu¬
ments of the Acropolis. The surface of the
Pentelic marble, a building material of
splendid appearance and great strength, is
becoming corroded and is disintegrating.
The main cause of the trouble is the
sulphur dioxide contained in industrial
fumes and in smoke from central heating
systems. The smallest degree of humidity
is. enough to let this sulphur dioxide attack
the marble surfaces, turning them into
gypsum. This plaster-like substance either
dissolves in the rain and is washed away or
else retains the soot and dust of the city to
form an ugly crust that subsequently
cracks.
If one adds to this the continuous natural
decay of the marble over a period of 24
centuries as a result of rain, hail, wind and
above all frost, it may easily be appreciat¬
ed why the Athenian masterpieces have for
the past few years been facing an unprece¬
dented danger.
The problem is obviously particularly
acute in the case of the sculptures: the
Caryatids of the Erechtheum, and the
frieze and pedimental statues that are still
on the Parthenon.
To remedy these ills, some temporary
measures have been proposed in addition
to a longterm clampdown on pollution. The
Parthenon frieze and the Caryatids are
already protected from rain and frost by
relatively unobtrusive temporary wooden
shelters, and the two statues from the west
pediment have been replaced by copies
and temporarily housed in the Acropolis
Museum.
One proposal under consideration is that
the Caryatids be completely enclosed in a
transparent air-conditioned box, until the
unavoidable task begins of dismantling
the south portico of the Erechtheum in
order to replace the steel reinforcements in
its beams.
It has also been proposed (though the
final decision has not been taken) to trans¬
fer the Caryatids to air-conditioned rooms
in the Museum, so that they may be res
tored to their proper position as soon as
environmental conditions permit. The
copies which would take their place are
already being cast (see back cover). Finally
the possibility of protecting the marble by
treating it locally remains under consider¬
ation; in this connexion the Second Inter¬
national Symposium on the deterioration of
building stones was held in Athens in
September 1976.
However, the requirement that any
operation performed on the ancient struc¬
tures should not be irreversible has
ruled out the use of almost all the materials
currently employed .in building for the
purposes of on-the-spot protection.
The Greek Government is actively seek¬
ing a radical solution to the problem of
the polluted atmosphere of Athens. A
zone has been defined around the Acropo¬
lis within which it is forbidden to burn oil,
which is rich in sulphur, in the central
heating systems of apartment blocks.
Meanwhile, a study has been made of
the technical and economic problems in¬
volved in replacing oil on a wider scale by
some other source of energy, such as
diesel, gas or electricity. The high cost of
this operation, which involves 5 million
cubic metres of dwelling space, and the
length of time required to implement the
change, are now being examined by the
city authorities.
The feeling of space on the Acropolis has
changed considerably since antiquity. This
is due in great measure to the archeological
excavations of the 19th century (mainly
after 1885), which exposed the bedrock at
almost every point. These excavations
uncovered the foundations of the buildings
which had not been visible during the
classical period, and made it difficult to
walk on the surface of the rock.
The general disorder is increased by the
hundreds of large and small pieces of
stonework from buildings of different
periods, which occupy a large area of
space and obstruct the visitor's passage.
Finally, irreparable damage is caused by
the feet of the visitors themselves. The
destruction has reached alarming propor¬
tions both on the floors of the monuments
and on the rock itself, that is, on the sur¬
faces that were visible during antiquity.

^buildings, and the layout of the ancient
pathways all features of great interest
are in danger of disappearing.
The attempt to solve this problem began
with a careful analysis of the present situa¬
tion. Detailed topographical plans were
prepared on a scale of 1:100, and photo¬
graphs were taken of the surface of the
rock from a small balloon. An inventory
of the scattered pieces of masonry is plan¬
ned, as well as a methodical system of
indexing them before they are moved, so
that they may easily be recognized and
classified before they are put in their final
place.
A study has also been made of the
possibility of covering a large area of the
rock with soil, so as to create easy access
to the monuments, as well as an esplanade
to the east of the Erechtheum.
Also being considered is the feasibility
of moving the pieces of masonry and
arranging them in such a way as to make
the archeology of the Acropolis more
readily comprehensible and to facilitate
future research. A new ramp leading to
the Propylaea, similar to that of ancient
times, has also been proposed.
Finally, a decision has been taken to
build a large new Acropolis Museum near¬
by, with modern facilities, to exhibit all
the finds from the Acropolis, some of
which are at present hidden away in store¬
rooms. An architectural competition has
been announced for the plans of this new
museum.
As far as the urban landscape of Athens
and its relation to the Acropolis are concer¬
ned, some improvements can be made.
A number of town-planning provisions
have been put into effect: tall buildings
can no longer be put up close to the Acro¬
polis and the neighbouring archeological
sites. Measures have also been proposed
for the preservation of Plaka, the old quar¬
ter that clusters around the lower northern
slopes of the rock. Finally, expropriations
of property have made it possible to re¬
open the Peripatos, a pathway for pedes¬
trians that encircled the Acropolis in
antiquity.
The Acropolis and its monuments have
passed through difficult times before,
during the course of their long history,
and have survived to the present day with
their ageless beauty, as a unique testimony
to a great age in the history of Western
civilization. In the attempt to hand on this
cultural heritage intact to future genera¬
tions, no effort can be considered too great.

The Porch of the Caryatids (right) was one of
three entrances to the Erechtheum, a temple
built to house a number of ancient
sanctuaries. The serious problems posed by
its conservation are now being examined by a
team of leading Greek specialists (see also
front and back covers). Of the six
Caryatids the maidens that support the
roofone (second from right on the façade)
got a face-lift in 1968-1969 (below right, before
and after restoration). Another (photo left) is
in fact a copy of a Caryatid which has been in
the British Museum, London, since 1816.
This is the second time that a major
conservation project has been undertaken on
the Acropolis in the 20th century: in unusual
photo taken in 1902 (below left), the roof of
the Porch has been dismantled to allow steel
girders to be inserted. Not knowing that the
steel would eventually rust and swell, causing
structural damage, the architect in charge
used the same technique elsewhere on the
Acropolis, thereby creating one of the most
arduous problems that specialists face today.
: Luckily, more sophisticated techniques
are now available. One of them,
photogrammetry, enables technicians to plot
the precise contours of sculptures or
monuments down to the last millimetre and
later to reconstitute their every feature.

An archeologist evokes the Acropolis
as ¡t was ¡n Antiquity
by John Travlos
THE Holy Rock known to history as
the Acropolis is a massive limestone
hill, 330 metres long and 170 metres
wide at its base, which rises to a height of
just over 156 metres above sea-level,
although no more than 50 metres above the
surrounding plain.
Its steep, almost vertical sides (except
in the west, where it slopes more gently),
its springs of water, and the large number
JOHN TRAVLOS, noted Greek architect and archeo¬
logist, is an authority on ancient Athens and its monu¬
ments. As architect to the American School of Classic¬
al Studies in Athens ( 1935- 1973) he was closely involved
in excavating the city's ancient Agora, supervising
the restoration of two of its monuments. He has
published many studies in archeological journals, and a
number ofbooks on Athenian history, including (as edi¬
tor) a Pictorial Dictionary of Ancient Athens (Thames
and Hudson, London, 1971).
of caves in its flanks offered a safe refuge
to its earliest inhabitants, who settled there
during the Neolithic period, about 3500
B.C.
In order to form a clear picture of the
topography of the Acropolis in the 5th
century B.C., one must first be familiar
with the monuments and other remains
discovered during excavations. These
make it possible to reconstruct the history
of the Holy Rock from Neolithic times until
the period when the artists of the classical
age created a vast new overall design.
The Parthenon, the Erechtheum, the
Propylaea and the temple of Athena Nike
(giver of victory) form an architectural
ensemble that gives expression to the
classical spirit and the perfection achieved
by the creative artists of the 5th century
B.C. However, they are usually examined
by archeologists and architects as separate
monuments.
Until now there has been no systematic
attempt to establish the topography of the
Acropolis, or to map out and restore the
ancient pathways and open spaces, so that
the modern visitor may stroll about and
admire the monuments, like the worshipper
in ancient times.
The destruction of these monuments,
which drastically altered the appearance of
the Acropolis, began in the 17th century
and continued until the Greek War of Inde¬
pendence, which broke out in 1821. The
Propylaea was seriously damaged as the
result of a gunpowder explosion in the
middle of the 17th century, while the
temple of Athena Nike was dismantled by
the Turks shortly before a Venetian attack
in 1687, and its masonry used to construct
a great bastion in front of the Propylaea.
The Parthenon was blown up by the
Venetian Francesco Morosini in 1687, and
the Erechtheum reduced to ruins. The
work of destruction was completed later by
the systematic pillaging of the sculptures
that decorated the temples.
With the aid of descriptions by 18th and
19th century travellers, and old pictures
and drawings, it is possible to imagine
what the Acropolis looked like during the
early years of Greek independence.
The Holy Rock was enclosed on all sides
by towering defensive walls of great thick¬
ness, which were particularly strong on the
west side, in front of the Propylaea, so as
to protect the entrance. A series of three
bastions mounted with cannons formed a

redoubtable fortification at this point. To
reach the Acropolis from the outer wall, it
was necessary to pass through these
bastions and through six well-protected
gates.
Inside the fortifications, the lower parts
of the monuments were covered by mas¬
sive marble blocks from the damaged
temples. About 300 small houses, in which
the soldiers of the Turkish garrison lived
with their families, were built on this layer
of debris.
The task of uncovering the ancient
monuments of the Acropolis began in April
1833, immediately after the liberation of
Athens and the departure of the Turkish
garrison. In August 1834, the Acropolis
ceased, by royal decree, to serve as a
fortress. The work was then placed on a
systematic basis, and the first excavations
took place. Demolition of the medieval
buildings (dating from the Byzantine,
Frankish and Turkish periods), many of
which had been built over the ancient
monuments, began in 1835.
The same period saw the demolition of
the great bastion in front of the Propylaea
and the initial restoration of the temple of
Athena Nike, using elements of the original
structure discovered in the walls of the
bastion. During major excavations on the
Acropolis between 1885 and 1890, all the
ancient monuments were uncovered and
the site assumed the form we know today.
The Acropolis Museum was enriched by
the addition of many ancient sculptures,
the famous statues of maidens called the
Korai, the pedimental sculptures and a
large number of architectural fragments,
all discovered in the rubble. When the
excavations were completed, work began
on the restoration of the Parthenon, the
Erechtheum and the Propylaea, while the
second restoration of the temple of Athena
Nike was finished just before the Second
World War.
The site of the Acropolis was thus inha¬
bited in Neolithic times. However, the ear¬
liest temples were erected during the so-
called geometric period, which lasted from
c. 900 until c. 700 B.C. and takes its name
from the geometric motifs which decorated
Greek pottery produced at that time.
By the 6th century B.C., there were two
large temples dedicated to Athena: the
Hecatompedon, which was 100 Attic feet
long and stood on the site subsequently
occupied by the Parthenon, and an ancient
temple whose foundations are preserved
to the south of the Erechtheum. The
Acropolis was covered with other, smaller
buildings, altars and votive monuments,
and it was still encircled by the so-called
Cyclopean wall which had once protected
the palace of the Mycenean king, although
by now it had ceased to serve as a for¬
tification.
In 556 B.C., the highest part of the
Mycenean tower that guarded the entrance
to the citadel was demolished, and the
first altar in honour of Athena Nike was
built on this conspicuous site. The occa¬
sion for this was the consecration of the
Panathenaea, the festival of Athens (1).
(1) The Panathenaea was an annual summer festival
celebrated by the Athenians on the birthday of Athena.
It was eventually held every four years with special
splendour. The celebrations at the quadrennial Great
Panathenaea consisted of athletic, musical and orato¬
rical contests, and culminated in the Panathenaic
Procession along the Sacred Way up to the Parthenon k
to present the goddess with a new robe or peplos. Y

The earlier, winding road which began
in front of the tower of Nike and led to the
Acropolis could no longer cater for the
crowds that followed the Panathenaic
Procession, and a straight ramp, 10 metres
wide and 80 metres long, was now cons¬
tructed. The fine retaining wall (mid-6th
century B.C.) which has survived along the
axis of the Propylaea formed part of this
ramp.
After the Athenian victory at Marathon
in 490 B.C., the Hecatompedon was demo¬
lished, and work began on the construction
of the first marble Parthenon. At the same
time, a monumental propylon (entrance)
with several doors was built on the site of
the ancient Mycenean fortified gateway.
It was later replaced by the Propylaea that
can be seen today.
Such was the appearance of tne Acro¬
polis until 480 B.C., when it was captured
and razed by the Persians, who caused
terrible damage to the temples, shrines and
votive monuments. Their fate was shared
by public buildings, houses and sanctuaries
throughout the city, whose walls were
systematically destroyed by the invader.
In 479 B.C., after their brilliant victories
at Salamis and Plataea, the Athenians
made it their first concern to build a new
wall to protect their city and to reconstruct
the monuments that had been destroyed.
This building programme was brought to
completion in the second half of the 5th
century, under the guidance of Pericles,
who succeeded, with the aid of inspired
architects, sculptors and painters in pro¬
ducing the matchless masterpieces that
still arouse our admiration today.
Majestic temples and altars arose on the
Acropolis to replace those destroyed by the
Persians. The new defensive walls also ser¬
ved as retaining walls to contain the mass
of rubble deposited on the Rock to increase
its area and to level its surface.
The architects who set out to rebuild the
monuments on the Acropolis were able to
approach the various problems confront¬
ing them with much greater freedom than
in the lower city, where their activities
were limited to the Agora, "the Place of
Gathering."
The work which began on the Acropolis
was based on a new architectural design:
the Propylaea were aligned differently, a
number of ancient shrines and altars were
buried when the rock was levelled, and
new pathways and open spaces were
created.
The Parthenon, the new temple in
honour of Athena Parthenos (Athena the
Virgin), was built between 447 and 432 B.C.
Its plans were drawn up by Ictinos and
Callicratès, and its decorative sculptures
were produced by Phidias, working in
collaboration with other talented artists.
The Erechtheum, an elegant Ionic temple
smaller than the Parthenon, was erected to
replace the Old Temple of Athena at a later
date, though still in accordance with the
initial plans. The expressiveness and
delicacy of its Ionic style contrast sharply
with the austere Doric style of the Par¬
thenon.
New Propylaea (437-432 B.C.) were built
by the architect Mnesicles on the western
side of the Acropolis on the site of the
earlier propylon but facing in a different
direction. This change was made so that
the worshipper arriving at the Acropolis
would be awed by the sight of the colossal
statue of Athena Promachos (Athena the
Warrior) standing precisely on the axis of
the Propylaea, framed by the Parthenon to
the right and the Erechtheum to the left.
The Propylaea, in the austere Doric style,
form a monumental entrance and façade to
the sanctuary of the Acropolis. The vast
central part, which constitutes the
entrance, is framed by two smaller.wings.
The south wing was taken up by a sanc¬
tuary, the elegant Ionic temple of Athena
Nike. The decision to build it was taken in
448 B.C., but construction began only in
427 B.C., based on plans by Callicratès,
and the temple was completed a few years
later. The fine marble parapet decorated
with figures of Nike (the Giver of Victory)
was set in place around the top of the
tower in 410 B.C.
Inside the Acropolis, just beyond the
Propylaea, is a large esplanade 50 metres
long and 43 metres wide and bounded on
each side by shrines. To the south stood
the shrine of Artemis Brauronia (the bear
goddess) and the Chalcothek, a long rec¬
tangular building where bronze weapons
were housed. To the north there was a
small building, the rampart, and the house
of the Arrephoroi, the maidens who were
cloistered on the Acropolis for almost a
year in order to weave the peplos of Athe¬
na. On the eastern side, the square ends at
the retaining wall of the terrace of the Old
Temple of Athena, where stood the colos¬
sal statue of Athena Promachos.
This point marked the beginning of two
passageways, one leading to the Par¬
thenon and the other to the Erechtheum.
The passage that led to the Parthenon,
known as the Sacred Way, is today cover¬
ed along its entire length by ancient blocks
of marble and other pieces of masonry.
Both the site and the width (6 to 7 metres)
can be determined with great accuracy,
however, from the cuttings in the rock for
the foundations of the two retaining walls
on either side. One of these walls supports
the terrace of the Parthenon and the other
the Old Temple of Athena.
The American architect G.P. Stevens
has advanced the theory that the retaining
wall of the Parthenon terrace reached
almost to the east end of the temple and
that the Sacred Way must thus have been
86 metres long. My own latest investiga¬
tions have shown, however, that the
cuttings which have been preserved were
not designed for the construction of a
continuous retaining wall but for a series
of dedications, which in my view formed
the southern edge of a large sacred area.
It is thus possible to demonstrate that
the Sacred Way was only 54 metres long,
and ended at the point where the inscrip¬
tion of Ge Kourotrophos ("Mother Earth of
Youths") was incised. It is at this point
that another large square begins, the
i precise limits of which can be determined
with precision. It was bounded on the
south by the Parthenon and the row of
votive monuments, on the north by the
Erechtheum, on the east by the shrine of
Zeus Polieus, and on the west, at least
until the middle of the 4th century B.C., by
the Opisthodomus (rear part) of the Old
Temple of Athena.
In the centre of this vast esplanade,
which measured 60 metres by 60 metres,
stood the great altar of Athena. I believe
that this was the sacred courtyard needed
to hold the immense crowds participating
in the Panathenaic Procession, which, as
we know, ended at the great altar of
Athena.
Such in all essentials was the appearance
of the Acropolis until the end of Antiquity.
Later additions were few, the most impor¬
tant being the circular temple of Rome and
Augustus which stands in front of the
east side of the Parthenon. In the middle
of the Ist century A.D., the ramp which led
to the entrance to the Propylaea was also
replaced by a monumental marble staircase.
Thus the information recorded by the
Greek geographer and historian Pausanias,
who visited Athens sometime in the middle
of the 2nd century A.D., constitutes the
most complete and reliable source concer¬
ning the appearance of the Acropolis in
the 5th century B.C. In his Guide to Greece
he provides a detailed description of the
monuments, statues and shrines which in
his time still existed on the Holy Rock.

Youthful faces from a buried past (Continued.)
According to legend, one of
the walls around the
Acropolis was built under
Athena's guidance by
Cyclopes and Giants (photo

of stone. The remains
of this ancient wall, still
known as the "Cyclopean
rampart", indicate that in
some places it was as much
as 6 m. wide and over 10 m.
high. Later, in 480 B.C., the
Persians sacked Athens and
desecrated or destroyed the
temples and statues of the
Acropolis. When the enemy
withdrew, the Athenians
buried the mutilated statues
in caves and sacred
cemeteries, where they were
unearthed by archeologists at
the end of the 19th century.
These votive statues are
among the finest examples of
Greek Archaic art. A
particularly outstanding
specimen is this early 6th-
century-B.C. figure (1) of a

Athenian
democracy's
grand design
by
Manolis Andronicos
THE Acropolis as it appears today is
essentially a product of the classical
age, even though the monuments
that have survived from its amazing his¬
tory range from vestiges of the Mycenean
period to the medieval tower at the south¬
west corner of the Parthenon.
The admiration for classical art, which
saw in its manifestations the archetype of
an ¡deal Beauty, disembodied and super¬
human in its calm detachment, helped to
distort the manner in which these works
were perceived. Our own age has reacted
against that attitude; with the discovery of
archaic, pre-classical art, the pendulum has
swung the other way.
Well-worn platitudes concerning the
harmony, beauty and serenity of classical
art are no longer enough, for we now know
that the art of any society is an expression
of the relationship between deep-seated
contradictions. It is consequently in
Athenian history itself that we must seek
an interpretation of the architectural elation
reflected in the buildings of the Acropolis.
An initial point to be emphasized is that
these buildingswhose celebrity is so well-
deservedwere only a part of the great
programme of public works initiated during
the period of Periclean democracy.
MANOLIS ANDRONICOS, professor of classical
archeology at the University of Thessalonika, is the
author of many studies on Greek archeology and his¬
tory. Among his works translated into English are:
The Acropolis, Delphi and Olympia, all published by
Caratzas Bros., New Rochelle, U.S.A., 1975. He also
contributed to Greek Museums, Barrie and Jenkins,
London, 1976.
How, indeed, can one fail to be amazed
when one considers not only the number
of edifices raised between 450 B.C. and
4Ö0 B.C., but also their variety, in form
and function alike? In Athens itself, this
period saw the construction of such build¬
ings as the Strategion (military head¬
quarters), the new Bouleuterion (where the
Council met), the Mint, the odeon of
Pericles, the Pompeion, the south porch of
the Agora, the Chalcothek (a storehouse of
bronze implements and arms), and the
porch of Artemis Brauronia (the bear
goddess) on the Acropolis.
During the same period, the first theatre
of Dionysos was fitted out, while an abun¬
dance of religious buildings made their
appearance, including the Parthenon, the
Propylaea and the Temple of Athena Nike,
the Erechtheum, the Temple of Hephaistos
(the Theseum) and the Temple of Apollo
Delphinios.
This feverish activity was an outward
expression of the inner wealth and ambi¬
tion of Athenian democracy under the
guidance of Pericles. The combination of
strength and equilibrium found in the forms
of classical art constitutes an intellectual
counterpoint to the social and political
stability of Athens at a rare moment in
history when deep contradictions were in a
state of balance.
Classical art is thus an attempt to recon¬
cile opposing tendencies which, instead
of cancelling each other out or yielding one
to the other, resolve their differences
through a process of thoughtful one
might say "democratic" dialogue.
But behind this facade of harmony and
coexistence, bold and radical forces were
at work. Together with his friends Anaxa-
goras the scientist, Protagoras the philo¬
sopher, Phidias the architect and sculptor,
and Damon the musician, Pericles dreamed
of transforming Athens into the political,
economic and intellectual capital of Greece.
Inspired by an enlightened patriotism,_
the Periclean circle believed that the whole'
world should rally round Athens and
accept a supremacy that threatened neither
friend nor enemy but was merely a fact of
history.
This outlook conditioned Pericles' pro¬
gramme, which set as a priority the recon¬
struction of the monuments on the Holy
Rock, symbol of the city's age-old history
and site of its ancestral cults. Barbarians (1 )
had burned down the ancient sanctuaries;
here was a unique opportunity to recon¬
struct the Acropolis in its entirety. Its three
outstanding monuments, the Parthenon,
the Propylaea and the Erechtheum, linked
by a relationship of function, would reflect
through their audacious architecture the
inventiveness of Periclean democracy.
Indeed, the buildings of the Acropolis
reflect more than a state of peaceful coexis¬
tence between the traditional Doric and
Ionic styles; they are a synthesis of these
styles^ brought together in an architecture
that has no precedents. What is more, the
Doric and Ionic elements themselves trans¬
cend the limits of their respective traditions
and assume a new, specifically Attic form.
Let us look first at the gateway to the
Acropolis, the Propylaea. Here, the archi¬
tect, Mnesicles, took the simple form of the
propylon (a gateway sheltered on each side
by an overhanging roof supported on two
pillars) and composed, with a host of archi¬
tectural innovations, a matchless prelude
to the buildings which lie beyond. The
underlying form and its components are
readily discernible; what is amazing is the

a pejorative sense. It was simply used to designate all
those who did not speaK the Greek language.

imaginative and creative manner in which
the parts are combined in the whole without
losing their individual value and without
obscuring the essential purpose of the
building.
Equally simple and ingenious is the inner
Ionic colonnade. Vast crowds of Athenians
were expected to visit the sanctuary; as
much space as possible had to be reserved
for their passage through the entrance.
Instead, therefore, of placing the thicker
Doric columns both outside and inside the
portal, the architect supported the roof of
the central passageway on the more slen¬
der Ionic pillars, which could be built to the
required height, but which took up less
room at ground level.
Passing through this monumental
entrance, we find ourselves on the Holy
Rock, face to face with its two most famous
buildings: the Parthenon, to the south, and
the Erechtheum, to the north. Both are
dedicated to the same goddess Athena,
the city's patron. "Live in happiness,
people of this city, seated beside the Virgin
of Zeus, and return her love," wrote Aes¬
chylus in the Eumenldes.
Pericles wished a special temple to be de¬
dicated to Athena, who was to be repre¬
sented in an incomparable manner by a
gold and ivory statue commissioned from
his friend Phidias.
Athena is thus the apotheosis of the
Athenian city-state, or rather, the expres¬
sion of its divinity. The outward appear¬
ance of the goddess matches the outward
appearance of the city over whose destiny
she presides. Her temple as conceived
by Pericles and his counsellors is an
outstanding symbol of Athens in the hey¬
day of its glory.
The Parthenon, which is the product of
collaboration between the architects Ictinus
and Callicratès, under the decisive gui¬
dance of Phidias, is a building of vision,
designed and realized with matchless
skill.
That the enormous amount of money
required for its construction was collected
in so short a time is a tribute both to the
determination of Pericles and to the state
of the city's finances.
Construction began in 447 B.C. and was
completed by 438 B.C.; a further six years
were required for the sculptures on its
gable ends, or pediments.
Measuring 31 x70 metres along the top
step of its foundations, the Parthenon is
the largest of the Greek temples, the only
one to be built entirely of marble and the
only temple in the Doric style whose
metopes (square spaces above the outside
colonnade) of which there are 92, are all
decorated with sculptures.
It is not these measurements, however,
which attract attention, but rather the
outstanding quality of execution and the
spirituality which emanates from the
material elements. For the first time in
Greek architecture, as a result of Phidias'
insistence that his gold and ivory statue
must be comfortably housed, the internal
A masterpiece of the Greek Doric order
(style) of architecture, the Parthenon also
incorporates elements of the more
decorative Ionic style. Through these
badly eroded Doric columns on the west
side of the temple can be seen part of the
superb Ionic frieze, the work of the great
sculpor Phidias, encircling the celia
(the temple's inner sanctum).
volume of a temple determines its external
form.
The proportions of the building are based
on the ratio known as the "golden
section". In the case of the Parthenon,
the ratio is 4 : 9, reflected in the relation¬
ship between the breadth and length of the
stylobate (the stepped foundation on
which the columns stand); in the relation¬
ship between the diameter of the columns
and the space between them; in that bet¬
ween the height and the width of the tem¬
ple; and in that between the numbers of
columns on its shorter and longer sides
(8 : 17).
The columns of the Parthenon are
unusually slender; they are set more closely
together than is generally the case, and
support a lighter entablature, or super¬
structure. The space between the columns
and the walls of the temple is abnormally
narrow (less than one-and-a-half times the
distance between the columns themselves)
while a second row of columns at each end
of the building give the impression that it
has a double peristyle.
This dense construction on the outside
of the temple contrasts with the space and
calm of the interior, whose amplitude is
underscored in the celia, or principal
chamber by a transversal row of columns.
The feeling of life inspired by the Parthe¬
non, the sense that it is indeed a living
organism, are due to two series of refine¬
ments: the subtle adjustments made to its
horizontal lines, which curve, and to its
vertical lines, which are inclined.
In fact, the horizontal lines of stylobate,
epistyle (architrave), cornice and pedi¬
ments alike are all slightly curved. The
stylobate, for example, which one would
expect to be a level foundation for the
columns, is not really level at all, but rises
in a gentle bulge (0.11 m.) in the centre of
each side and 0.06 m. in the middle of
each end.
The walls and columns, instead of being
strictly vertical, are inclined slightly inwards.
The columns at the sides and the ends
lean inwards to a distance of 7 cm., while w

, ed diagonally lean inwards to a distance
of 10 cm. The inner face of the walls inside
the colonnade is vertical, but the outer face
is similarly inclined. Thus, the volume of
the temple, instead of being contained by
parallelograms, is shaped like a truncated
pyramid.
When we realize that each building block
was trapezoidal and not rectangular in
shape, and that almost every one of them
had its own specific dimensions, since the
curving of the horizontal lines and the
inclination of the verticals create different
angles and surfaces throughout the build¬
ing, the skill required to transform these
subtleties of design into reality is well-nigh
unbelievable. If the architects of the
Parthenon were men of genius, the crafts¬
men responsible for the execution of the
project had to work with the highest degree
of precision, calculating each element in
the minutest detail.
The sculptures which decorate this
matchless piece of architecture are proba¬
bly the work of Phidias himself, helped by
his two closest collaborators, Alcamen and
Agoracritos. The decorations are both
grandiose and original; those on the east¬
ern pediment represent the birth of Athena
in a composition which combines strength
with nobility. Those at the western end
relate the Attic legend of the contest
between Athena and Poseidon (the sea-
god) for possession of the city.
The 92 square metopes above the colon¬
nade illustrate four cycles of myths, in¬
volving the combats of Gods and Giants,
of the Centaurs and the Lapiths, of
Greeks and Amazons, and the capture of
Troy. Pediments and metopes alike thus
provided Phidias with the opportunity
of re-telling, in a manner that was unique,
the ancient myths of Athena and the land
of Attica.
Inspired by the vision of Athenian demo¬
cracy at the height of its glory, Phidias
conceived the ingenious idea of immorta¬
lizing in marble the people of Athens them¬
selves. He would portray for posterity the
joyous occasion when the whole city old
men and boys, women and maidens alike-
mingled with the gods for the great Pana¬
thenaic Procession, Athens' biggest festi¬
val, and climbed the Holy Rock with offer¬
ings and with the new saffron robe, the
peplos, woven to drape the xoanon, an
ancient statue of Athena carved from the
wood of the olive-tree.
A friend of Pericles and of the philoso¬
pher Anaxagoras, Phidias believed that his
representation of the old Attic legends
should be accompanied by the new
achievements of democracy.
But Phidias was a sculptor, not an ora¬
tor, and it is difficult to transform pane¬
gyrics into images. The task required all
his genius, experience and audacity as one
of the leading artists of his time.
The vision demanded a greater spread
of space than pediments and metopes
could provide; what was wanted for his
composition was a continuous frieze.
Boldly, Phidias decided to add to his Doric
temple this element of the Ionic style, in
the form of a band, 160 metres in length
and 1.60 metres high, running round the
temple walls.
This frieze should not be considered as
a realistic portrayal of the Panathenaic
procession. The composition is above all
a poetic one, the translation of a sacred
occasion into plastic terms. "Real" space
and "real" time have been abolished here:
the participants in the Panathenaea advan¬
ce with a rhythm imposed by the sculptor
in an environment of "poesy". The pro¬
cession becomes a symphony, in the mu¬
sical sense of the term. Reality, religion
and art are interwoven.
As if following the procession in space
and time, Phidias sets its beginning at the
southwest corner of the temple, and takes
it round the building to the east door. But
this is really a pretext for the movements
of his symphony, which opens pianissimo,
with simple harmonies and the introduction
of the major themes such as the rearing
horse on the eighth carved slab of the
western end and the escort of horsemen
on the north and south sides of the temple.
On these carved slabs, the art of sculp¬
ture in relief achieves perfection: six or
seven horsemen are represented with re¬
markable clarity on different planes. The
rhythmic procession continues towards the
centre of the east end, where the Gods
have already arrived.

ponsibility and freedom andfinally of
the city at peace with itself, immune from
both anarchy and despotism.
Opposite the Parthenon, on the north
. side of the Acropolis, stands the second
of its most famous temples, the Erech¬
theum. Though dedicated to Athena Po-
lias, the goddess of the city, the building
was imbued with a religious significance
that outstripped the limits of the traditional
cult. It went deeper than the roots of the
traditional faith into the soil of Attica,
the medium which brought into communi¬
cation with each other all the divinities and
demons which presided over the destiny of
the citizens of Athens.
From time immemorial, a temple had
sheltered the xoanon, the wooden ¡mage of
Athena which had supposedly fallen from
heaven. The primitive cults of Attica were
also worshipped there. The Persians had
destroyed this ancient temple. Although
Pericles had died before the work of re¬
construction began in 421 B.C., it is certain
that the plans for a new building worthy of
the cults it was to house had been prepar¬
ed, and the site chosen, before his death.
The new temple was constructed a little
to the north of its predecessor, at a respect¬
ful distance from the Parthenon. Besides
housing the most venerable cults of Athens
of Athena and Poseidon the tem¬
ple included among its furnishings the
tomb of Erechtheus (son of Gaea, goddess
of the earth, represented as half-man, half-
serpent) and the sacred serpent; and the
tombs of Cecrops, founder and first king
of Athens, and of the Athenians' earliest
ancestors.
It also contained the mark where Posei¬
don's trident struck the rock so that a salt
water spring known as the "Erechtheis
sea" leapt from the cleft. Room had to
be found not only for the altars of Zeus,
Poseidon, Hephaistos, and the ancient
xoanon of Hermes, but also for the city's
sacred olive tree and the sanctuary of
Pandrosos (daughter of Cecrops and pries¬
tess of Athena) containing the altar of
Zeus Herkeios.
Despite all these difficulties, the resultant
building, which resembles no other temple
in Greece, was of a skilful simplicity that
met all the above requirements.
Without departing from tradition, its
architect was able to introduce a number
of strikingly apt innovations, such as the
elegant loggia which projects from the
southern part of the temple, where the
Caryatids courageously support the weight
of the entablature without sacrificing any
of their feminine grace and charming
nobility.
The Ionic grace of the Erechtheum con¬
stitutes a discreet yet captivating pendant
to the Doric power and splendour of the
Parthenon. Centuries later, contemplating
these eternally fresh examples of Attic
art at its most glorious, Plutarch, one of the
last of the ancient Greeks to appreciate his
country's classic past, was to sum up the
feelings they inspired as follows (from
"Lives of the Noble Grecians and
Romans", translated by Sir Thomas North,
1579. See also page 26):
"For every one of those works which
were finished up at that time seemed then
to be very ancient and yet it looketh at his
daye as if it were but newly done and finish¬
ed, ther.e is suche a certaine kynde of flor-
ishing freshness in it, which letteth that the
injurie of time cannot impaire the sight
thereof: As if every one of those foresaid
workes had some living spirite in it, to
make it seeme young and fresh: and a
soule that lived ever, which kept them in
their good continuing state..."

A citadel
in praise
of peace
THE Athenians began to build the
monuments that can be seen on the
Acropolis today shortly after they ,
made peace with Persia in 449 B.C.
Thirty years before, the Persian King,
Xerxes, had set out to conquer Greece.
Twice during the Persian campaign, the
Acropolis was captured and destroyed by
fire: in 480 by Xerxes himself, and in 497 by
his general Mardonius.
A year after the peace treaty was signed,
Pericles, the leader of the democratic party
and the most important figure in Athenian
politics after Themistocles, called on all the
Greeks to hold a conference at which they
could decide jointly on the reconstruction
of the shrines destroyed by the enemy.
This conference never took place, and
the Athenians began the work of recon¬
struction on their own in 447 B.C. In 445
a Thirty-Year Truce was declared between
Athens and Sparta and this favoured the
rapid progress of the enterprise.
The first task was to rebuild the temple
of Athena, the Parthenon. Work then
began on the Propylaea, but it was inter¬
rupted by the outbreak of the Peloponne-
sian War between Athens and Sparta in
431 B.C. Lastly, the Athenians tackled the
construction of the temple of Athena Nike
and the Erechtheum, which they built on a
site believed to have been occupied by the
palace of the mythical King Erechtheus.
As both an official centre of worship and
a citadel, as well as a place which evoked a
large number of precious traditions, the
Acropolis was of supreme importance to
the Athenians. It was the ancient city, the
immemorial seat of kings, demi-gods and
strange legendary creatures like the dual
figure of Erechtheus-Erichthonius, who
was both man and snake.
In the 6th century B.C., it had been the
seat of the "tyrant" Pisistratus and his
successors. The chorus of old men in
Aristophanes' comedy Lysistrata tells how
the people of Athens ousted the tyrants
with the help of the Spartan king Cleo-

menés I, and then expelled Cleomenes
himself, who had set up a puppet govern¬
ment in their place.
In the Lysistrata, the people reminisce on
these events with great pride, for at the
time when the play appeared, in 411 B.C.,
democracy was in danger: the Athenians
had just suffered a disastrous defeat in
Sicily.
About a hundred years earlier, in 506
B.C., the young Athenian democracy had
erected its first trophy in a prominent place
beside the entrance to the Acropolis. The
trophy took the form of a bronze four-horse
chariot made from spoils abandoned on the
battlefield by Athens' northern neighbours,
the Boeotians, and by the Chalcidians, who
shared the aristocratic ideology of Sparta

<![CDATA[
THE GODDESS ATHENA was worshipped throughout the Greek world. Usually depicted
with helmet, spear and shield, she was also the personification of wisdom and patroness
of all arts and crafts. Head of Athena, above, is a detail from the Battle of the Giants, a
group of figures that once adorned the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis (c. 525 B.C.).
Only the foundations of the temple remain. Left, magnificent bronze statue of the goddess
with outstretched hand was found in 1959 at the Piraeus, the port of Athens.
and had invaded Athens in a vain attempt
to overthrow the new democracy.
It is significant that the inscription on
the base of the chariot does not give credit
for the victory to any specific military or
political leader, but simply to the "sons of
Athens". This is a rare example of a monu¬
ment to victory that mentions no names,
but only the anonymous soldiers who made
the triumph possible. It expresses the pride
which the people of Athens took in their
newborn democracy, and its site reflects
their profound love for the Acropolis, for
their "city" as it was called in all simplicity
by the chorus in the Lysistrata.
The Athenians had already revealed
their devotion to the sacred place in 480
B.C., as they prepared to meet the Persian
threat. As they waited for the enemy, they
disagreed about the correct interpretation
of the Delphic oracle, which had proph¬
esied that they would be saved by "wood¬
en walls". Herodotus tells how the old
guard elderly men who were still fit
enough for battle to make things difficult
for Xerxes dug themselves in behind the
wooden palisades of the Acropolis.
The other warriors followed Themisto-
cles, agreeing with the view of the majority
that the "wooden walls" referred to by the
oracle meant the strong navy which the
Athenians had mustered on Themistocles'
advice during the previous ten years.
But before embarking on the triremes
(galleys with three banks of oars) in which
they were to serve as hoplites or ordinary
foot-soldiers, the Athenian cavalrymen
rode to the Acropolis and hung up their
reins as an offering to the goddess Athena.
When the war was over, Themistocles,
the architect of victory, made it his first
priority to fortify the Acropolis. Even
today, massive blocks of stone from the
temples and shrines burned down by the
Persians can be seen in the upper part of
its northern wall. They served as a constant
reminder of the conquerors' desecrations.
There were many reasons why military
architecture should have been given top
priority. In 477 B.C., a powerful alliance
known as the Delian League was formed
under the leadership of Athens. Initially the
League was a purely defensive alliance, but
it soon embarked on a policy of aggression
and expansion which caused dissensions
and led to armed confrontation between
the allies.
There followed a six-year Egyptian
campaign, during which the Athenians
attempted at considerable cost to dislodge
the Persians and gain control over that
wealthy and fertile country. At about the
same time, they came to grips with Sparta
and her allies in a bid for hegemony over
the whole of mainland Greece.
As a result of these military activities, the
Athenians put all their efforts into fortifying
the city. The most important of their pro¬
jects was the construction of the Long
Walls, which transformed the area stretch
ing from the Acropolis in the west to the
port of Piraeus in the south and to Phaleron
in the north into one vast fortified triangle.
The fact that the Acropolis itself was
neglected for over three decades after the
great Greek victories and the Persian
retreat is an indication of Themistocles'
realism and efficiency in organizing and co¬
ordinating the economic, foreign and
military policy of Athens. He saw that the
best way to extend Athenian sovereignty
was to consolidate Athenian sea-power.
This neglect of the Acropolis also reveals
the extent of the ambitions harboured by
the young men in Pericles' radical party
who came to power in 462 B.C., after
Kimon, the leader of the aristocratic party,
had turned the Aegean into an Athenian
sea after his victory at the River Eurymedon
on the coast of Asia Minor in 468. These
ambitions went far beyond the expansion¬
ist dreams and plans of their political
predecessors, and they kept the city in a
state of war against both Persia and Sparta
for more than 10 years.
Athens finally made peace with Persia in
449 B.C., and with Sparta four years later.
At last the Athenians could devote them¬
selves to the reconstruction of the Acro¬
polis.
Like Pericles' famous funeral oration in
honour of the men who perished during
the first year of the Peloponnesian War,
but to an even greater degree, the Par¬
thenon was the result of a passionate
search for an act of faith. A similar search,
informed by the same passion, took place
during the same period in the Athenian
theatre.
The monuments on the Acropolis and
the great plays performed in the theatre
of Dionysus at the foot of the Rock have
often been presented as the artistic expres¬
sion of a people at the height of its glory,
demonstrating its pride in victory.
Yet it should be remembered that victory
preceded the sculptural and architectural
masterpieces on the Acropolis by more
than 30 years a whole generation. The
history of this hard-working, tenacious
generation and of their grim struggles
between the Persian Wars and the "Thirty-
Year Truce" with Sparta, reveals in much
clearer perspective the meaning of the
monuments built on the Acropolis during
the Golden Age. For these monuments
were, in fact, dedicated to the defeated as
well as to the victors.
They undoubtedly reflect the victory
over the Persians, which gave the Athen¬
ians the independence and power to res¬
tore on their city's sacred site monuments
which expressed more perfectly than be¬
fore their political freedom, their convic¬
tions and their aims.
But these monuments also reflect the
Athenians' sense of defeat in their first
headlong confrontation with historya
defeat that came after 50 years of military
preparations and struggles, first for the
survival of Athens and Greece as a whole,
and then for the extension and consoli¬
dation of their civilization.
These long and arduous struggles seem
to have filled the Athenians with amaze- k
ment at the infinite prospects opening upP

y before them in their new role as masters of
the Aegean Sea. But they had also expe¬
rienced doubt and disappointment. So
many projects had ended tragically, their
outcome being left to the mercy of Chance,
the new goddess of adventurers, rather
than to knowledge and experience.
One cannot help wondering what the
Athenian craftsmen, seeking as they did
nothing less than perfection, must have
thpught of the disastrous blunders commit¬
ted by the sorcerers' apprentices of the
expansionist policy.
For all those magnificent artists and for
the multitude of clear-sighted Athenian
men and women, the Parthenon represent¬
ed a kind of home-coming, a return to
Ithaca after a nightmarish Odyssey outside
the tranquil confines of traditional life. It
was a return to a reality they could manage
and control, using clean, hard materials
they could trust, unlike the bloodstained,
treacherous stuff of History.
For History had taught the Athenians ,
some cruel lessons. There had been bloo¬
dy, inglorious defeats, such as the disaster
at Drabescus in 465 B.C., when 10,000
men, women and children (an enormous
number, considering the population of
Athens at the time) were sent to Thrace to
found a colony and were virtually annihilat¬
ed by the indigenous population.
There had been disasters in Egypt,
where the Athenians fought for six conse¬
cutive years (460-454 B.C.). Disaster at
Tanagra in Boeotia, where the Athenians
were routed by the Spartans and Boeotians
in 458 B.C. and suffered the humiliation
of seeing their victors set up an arrogant
memorial, in the form of a gold shield made
from the Athenian spoils, on the newly-
built temple of Olympia.
Disaster struck again in 447 B.C. At
Koroneia in Boeotia, many Athenian volun¬
teers of them scions of noble fami¬
lies along with their general,
Tomides, and Cleinias, the father of Alci-
biades, in an ambitious attempt to extend
Athenian sovereignty to the fertile regions
on the mainland north of Athens.
Another spectacular failure had been the
deterioration of relations between the
Athenians and their allies in the islands and
coastal regions of the Aegean. Many of
these allies renounced their treaties with
Athens and fought to regain their indepen¬
dence. The toll in human lives was high
and opened a deep rift of hatred between
the allied cities.
When their great victories over the
Persian empire had opened the way to
mastery of the Aegean, the Athenians had
been faced with a difficult choice. Now
they were seized with doubts as to the
Tightness of the historical course they had
chosen.
Sculpture in marble is an austere art that
admits no mistakes. As in politics, a false
move cannot be erased. But the Parthenon
was built by craftsmen who had complete
mastery of their material and who could
match the finished work to the design they
had in mind with absolute precision. After
the harsh lessons of History, these 'men
must have felt a profound need for consis¬
tency and coherence.
The Parthenon was built in a spirit of
ruthless perfectionism according to a plan
that anticipated and forestalled any alte¬
rations that might prove necessary when it
emerged on the actual site, and was con¬
fronted with the surrounding landscape,
the horizon, the encircling mountains and
the bright sunlight.
The Parthenon reveals the sense of
poetry of the Athenian people, who found
artistic and intellectual inspiration in the
Attic countryside bathed in its unique
limpid light.
But it also shows how the ordeal result¬
ing from their society's radical change of
direction and from the disasters caused by
its expansionist dreams finally found
expression in a passion for artistic per¬
fection.
Thé monuments on tne Acropolis express
for all time that yearning for an end to the
kind of historical opportunism and expan¬
sionist aberrations which Euripides casti¬
gates in the Hippolytus, when Aphrodite
and Theseus wrathfully claim obedience
from obstinate and foolish men.
The harmonious relationship between
the Parthenon and its environment holds a
lesson that impresses itself on the mind
without rhetoric or exaggeration. It is
noteworthy that the symbol to which the
advocates of power politics attached most
importance, the gold and ivory statue of
the goddess Athena in full war attire, was
hidden away in the inner part of the temple.
In seeking and achieving this harmonious
relationship with the surrounding land¬
scape, the inspired artists of 5th-century
Athens were actually finding their way
back to their origins, back to the reality
which their own land offered them. The
Parthenon and the other monuments on
the Acropolis guided the Athenian back to
his familiar horizon, enclosed by the islands
of Aegina and Salamis, making him feel
that what he saw before him was good and
beautiful.
The Parthenon high on its rock and the
tragic and comic poets in the theatre of
Dionysus below each in their own way
celebrated peace. '
In 431 B.C., the year in which the Pelo-
ponnesian War broke out, Euripides prais¬
ed in his Medea the rare gifts and incompa¬
rable destiny of the Athenians and their
divine fortune in possessing such a land
beneath such a sky. There is no mention of
courage nor military valour, nor of great
conquests.
Euripides simply celebrates the blessed
land of Harmony and the nine Muses. This
is no facile phrase-making but a confession
of faith, the affirmation of a conscious
choice, a vote for peace:
The people of Athens, sons of
Erechtheus,
have enjoyed their prosperity
Since ancient times. Children of blessed
gods,
They grew from holy soil unscorched by
invasion.
Among the glories of knowledge their
souls are pastured;
They walk always with grace under the
sparkling sky.
There long ago, they say, was born
golden-haired Harmony,
Created by the nine virgin Muses of
Pieria.
They say that Aphrodite dips her cup
In the clear stream of the lovely Cephisus;
It is she who breathes over the land the
breath
Of gentle honey-laden winds; her flowing
locks
She crowns with a diadem of sweet-
scented roses.
And sends the Loves to be enthroned
beside Knowledge,
And with her to create excellence in
every art.
Then how will such a city,
Watered by sacred rivers,
How will Athens welcome
You, the child-killer
Whose presence is pollution?
Contemplate the blow struck at a child.
Weigh the blood you take upon you.
Medea, by your knees.
By every pledge or appeal we beseech
you,
Do not slaughter your children!
(translated by Philip Vellacott)
This choice is also apparent in the monu¬
ments of the Acropolis, in their conception,
in their relationship to the landscape, in
their every detail. It emphasizes the impor¬
tance of the traditional way of life. The

Skilful horsemanship
was held in high esteem
by the Athenians. At
the city's Panathenaic
Games, held in honour
of Athena, jockeys
showed their prowess
in fiercely competitive
horseback and chariot
races. All the nobility
of horses is expressed in
this spirited head from a
marble statue in the
Acropolis Museum. It
was carved by a Greek
artist c. 490-480 B.C.
Parthenon is its most eloquent illustration.
Starting from the western side, the
procession moves along the north and
south sides to the eastern front of the
temple where the gods sit peacefully,
welcoming the Athenian citizens. No such
democratic representation can be found
elsewhere, at Olympia, for example.
Inside the temple stood Phidias' gold and
ivory statue of Athena, the formidable ally
of her people colossal in proportion to
the high ceiling, and therefore superhuman
in the eyes of men. Outside, the gods,
shown as rivals on the western pediment,
are transformed on the eastern pediment
and the frieze into peaceful subjects of the
primeval Mother Earth, restraining man
from the temptations of overweening pride
and violence.

I
I T is no more than fair", Pericles told the Athenians, "that after
Athens has been equipped with all she needs to carry on the
war, she should apply the surplus to public works, which,
once completed, will bring her glory for all time, and while they are
being built will convert that surplus to immediate use. In this way
all kinds of enterprises and demands will be created which will
provide inspiration for every art, find employment for every hand,
and transform the whole people into wage-earners, so that the
city will decorate and maintain herself at the same time from her
own resources."
Certainly it was true that those who were of military age and
physically in their prime could always earn their pay from the public
funds by serving on Pericles' various campaigns. But he was also
anxious that the unskilled masses, who had no military training,
should not be debarred from benefiting from the national income,
and yet should not be paid for sitting about and doing nothing.
So he boldly laid before the people proposals for immense
public works and plans for buildings, which would involve many
different arts and industries and require long periods to complete,
his object being that those who stayed at home, no less than those
serving' in the fleet or the army or on garrison duty, should be
enabled to enjoy a share of the national wealth.
The materials to be used were stone, bronze, ivory, gold,
ebony, and cypress-wood, while the arts or trades which wrought
or fashioned them were those of carpenter, modeller, coppersmith,
stone-mason, dyer, worker in gold and ivory, painter, embroiderer,
and engraver, and besides these the carriers and suppliers of the
materials, such as merchants, sailors, and pilots for the sea-borne
traffic, and waggon-makers, trainers of draught animals, and
drivers for everything that came by land.
So the buildings arose, as imposing in their sheer size as they
were inimitable in the grace of their outlines, since the artists
strove to excel themselves in the beauty of their workmanship.
And yet the most wonderful thing about them was the speed with
which they were completed. Each of them, men supposed, would
take many generations to build, but in fact the entire project was
carried through in the high summer of one man's administration.
On the other hand we are told that when Zeuxis the painter
once heard Agatharchus boasting about how swiftly he painted
his figures, his retort was, "Mine take, and last, a long time".
Certainly mere dexterity and speed of execution seldom give a
lasting value to a work of art or bestow a delicate beauty upon it.
It is the time laid out in laborious creation which repays us later
through the enduring strength it confers.
It is this, above all, which makes Pericles' works an object of
wonder to us the fact that they were created in so short a span,
and yet for all time. Each one possessed a beauty which seemed
venerable the moment it was born, and at the same time a youthful
vigour which makes it appear to this day as if it were newly built.
A bloom of eternal freshness hovers over these works of his and
preserves them from the touch of time, as if some unfading spirit
of youth, some ageless vitality had" been breathed into them.
The Propylaea, or portals of the Acropolis, of which Mnesicles
was the architect, were finished in the space of five years. While
they were being built, a miraculous incident took place, which
suggested that the goddess Athena herself, so far from standing
aloof, was taking a hand and helping to complete the work.
One of the workmen, the most active and energetic among
them, slipped and fell from a great height. He lay for some time
severely injured, and the doctors could hold out no hope that he
would recover.
Pericles was greatly distressed at this, but the goddess
appeared to him in a dream and ordered a course of treatment,
which he applied, with the result that the man was easily and
quickly healed. It was to commemorate this that Pericles set up
the bronze statue of Athena the Healer near the altar dedicated to
that goddess, which they say was there before.
But it was Phidias who directed the making of the great
golden statue of Athena, and his name is duly inscribed upon the
marble tablet on the Acropolis as its creator. Almost the whole
enterprise was in his hands, and because of his friendship with
Pericles all the artists and craftsmen came under his orders.

Nashville, Tenn. (U.S.A.) Munich (Federal Republic of Germany)
Acropolomania
Ancient Greek architecture suddenly came
back into vogue around 1815-1820. From
then on up to recent times, the style known
as "neo-Greek" was used in many public
buildings, particularly in Europe and the
United States. On this page we present
examples of these monuments, some faith¬
ful copies, some pastiches of Athenian
models.
Unlike the "neo-Classical" style in favour
in the 18th century, the neo-Greek style
relied on precise archeological data. The
Parthenon in Nashville (photo 1), inaugurat¬
ed in 1931, is an exact-size replica of the
original building.
Pierre-Yves Balut, a French art historian
teaching at the Sorbonne University in Paris,
is making a compilation of these buildings.
Some of them, he notes, display "a return
to ancient techniaues and aesthetic canons.
both of which have been studied in detail
and perfectly reproduced."
The Munich Propylaea (photo 2), built
between 1832 and 1862, even include a
reproduction of the pathway that the ancient
Greeks had been obliged to dig through the
steeply sloping side of the Acropolis so that
the chariots in the Panathenaic Procession
could pass. For the Walhalla at Ratisbon
(photo 3), erected between 1830 and 1842,
the builders even imitated the ancient Greek
technique of stone-fitting without mortar.
The Caryatids of St. Paneras Church in
London (photo 4), those of the Faculty of
Medicine in Paris (photo 5) and those of the
Parliament in Vienna (photo 6) are a far cry
from the perfection attained in Antiquity.
Yet perfect or not, these neo-Greek build¬
ings testify to what Mr. Balut calls "the
eternal fascination in the West for the long-
lost days of its infancy"

During the long period before its discov¬

did not, of course, really cease to exist. On
the contrary, old engravings and the tales
of the earliest travellers show it to be a
busy, crowded place, cluttered with
houses, with churches andat a later
datewith mosques.
There on the Rock, in a hubbub of his¬
tories, customs and facades, so different
from today's bright emptiness, a bustling
population of Greeks, then Turks, Arme¬
nians and Albanians lived out their lives and
loves. For hundreds of years, these "Acro-
politans" (a name we may give them for the
sake of simplicity) were its only occupants!
A number of engravings, which deserve
to be better known, reveal to us this long-
lost age, and tell its strange, forgotten
story. Let us look, for example, at those
made from drawings by "Athenian" Stuart,
from Edinburgh, and the Englishman
Revett, who travelled together in Greece
between 1751 and 1753, and who saw the
Acropolis in the state we have described.
A patchwork of houses, stitched with
narrow, winding lanes, and gardens graced
with olive and mimosa covers the whole
site, from the Propylaea at its entrance to
the far end of the Parthenon, which is
itself hemmed in by walls and screened
with branches. Inside the temple gleam the j
cupolas of a Turkish mosque; it will remain I

there for many years to come, and only
disappear in 1842.
Another engraving shows the Erech¬
theum, and beyond it a large house, from
whose walled courtyard prods a single
cypress. The ancient temple seems to
have become a place of meditation: under
its porch lower than it is today because
not yet excavated an Acropolitan sits
cross-legged and gazes dreamily at the sky.
Close at hand, in the streets and square of
what might be a village, stroll men in tur¬
bans; children play, dogs sniff, and a
horseman crosses in the background.
Fifty years later, in 1805 or thereabouts,
when Edward Dodwell, another English
traveller whose remarkable series of Views
in Greece from Drawings will be published
in London in 1821, paints the Acropolis,
the scene has hardly changed. The houses
on the Rock are still set in walled court¬
yards shaded by olive trees and slender
cypresses. A large building (a barracks or a
warehouse?) flanks the north side of the
Parthenon. Turkish noblemen and shep¬
herds idle the hours away under the dazzl¬
ing Attic sunlight, its brilliance stippled
with the red of tiled roofs.
Now there can be no mistake: this is
indeed a village and not a temple or a
shrine a real village, captured by the
painter in its hours of bustle and of sun¬
drenched silence, with its braying, bleating
animals, its market, its bazaar. Here, now,
the ancient gods are dead beyond recall;
the only remaining trace of their presence is
in these half-buried columns, these toppled
marble heads and busts which the Acrop-
olitans sometimes use as seats.
Many other pilgrims saw and described
the Acropolis thus transmogrified: the
Oriental village, the improvised fortress,
the bazaar littered with marble blocks and
statues. Their accounts and their engrav¬
ings all tell the same reassuring and yet
melancholy story.
They tell us that the Acropolis was not
lost to history throughout all these obscure
centuries, but that it humbly survived, as
village, citadel and market-place; that the
Parthenon was saved from abandon and
ruin to become a church dedicated to the
Mother of God, and then a Turkish
mosque.
They tell us that a daily life that was first
Greek and then Turkish in content, first
Christian and then Muslim in belief, per¬
sisted on the Holy Rock of the Ancient
Greeks, in the stronghold of the Byzan¬
tines and in the fortress of the War of
Independence.
I like to think that in this way, throughout
a long history that has been sacred as well
as profane (since gods, or a single God,
have always been worshipped there), the
Acropolis has remained true to its ancient
vocation, nurturing in its own way the
same sacred and profane spirit that moved
with the crowds through its .statue-lined
streets, arnong its altars and its trophies,
during the Golden Age of Pericles.
Today's Acropolitans are the tourists.
Archeology is the new faith and arche¬
ologists are the priests of the new cult.
After so many centuries of obscurity, I
cannot but reflect on the strange destiny
of a site which resurfacing barely a cen¬
tury ago in Western consciousness, re-
emerging as the birthplace of Reason
after 25 centuries of neglect is once again
threatened.
Although it served as market-town,
fortress and refuge for religions, and
although its ruins remained eloquent, the
Acropolis was for so long a backwater,
leading a withdrawn, meditative and pro¬
vincial life.
Today, as a place of pilgrimage for those
in quest of culture, it retransmits the newly
transparent message of the ages, the time-
worn brilliance of its marbles, the purity of
this flat-topped hill, to which excavations
and the clearance of rubble have restored
the naked virginity of its primeval rock
(yellowed in autumn by tufts of camo¬
miles there are flowers on the Acro¬
polis for those who know where to look).
But there is also the thoughtless immo¬
deration of its crowds of visitors....
Although the long silence has suddenly
been broken by tumult, the Acropolis
remains an enigma, questioning us as the
Sphinx questioned Oedipus. Whether we
look at it at dawn, at midday or in the
evening twilight, whether we contemplate
the interplay of light and shadow at the
beginning or the end of things, we seem to
hear the same voice quietly asking: "Who
built me as the sun rose on the Western
world? Who perfumed me with incense as
it passed through the zenith of Reason?
Who protected me during the twilight of
my gods?"
"Man", is the answer. And not only
Attic man, but man come out of the East,
and out of the West, to live together,
throughout all the forgotten centuries, on
this incomparable rock.
The monument of the Acropolis which
has always been my favourite is the little
temple of Athena Nike (the Giver of Vic¬
tory), which stands at its westward end,
facing the sea and the setting sun.
Once, it sheltered a statue of the god¬
dess, carved from an olive trunk, standing
upright, holding out in her right hand a
fruit, a pomegranate. This statue no longer
exists; it had already disappeared when the
rock was occupied by the Acropolitans of
our story.
And yet it is in this long-lost statue that
I see the clearest and most lasting symbol
of the essential agelessness of the site and
of the rock: this Victory carved from an
olive-tree, offering to all eternity the most
ephemeral of fruits.
This symbol, too, the olive-tree grafted
by human hands, this gesture of offering,
of certainty and light, is part of the heritage
of all mankind.
I Jacques Lacarriöre
In this work executed by the Hungarian painter Csontvary around
the beginning of the 20th century, the Acropolis forms a
picturesque backdrop to a scene of elegant ladies visiting Athens
in a horse-drawn carriage.

Aristotle
An architect
of modern thought
2,300 years ago
by Constantine Despotopoulos
MORE than any other thinker, Aris¬
totle has influenced philoso¬
phical and scientific thought in
Europe, in the non-European countries of
the Mediterranean basin, and in all those
whose cultures are fashioned on European
lines.
This influence, whether direct or indirect,
has been felt by thinkers as diverse as Karl
Marx, who admired Aristotle's work, and
the French philosopher Henri Bergson,
who described his great predecessor's
metaphysical theory as that which most
closely reflects the nature of the human
mind. For centuries, philologists, philo¬
sophers and historians have studied Aris¬
totle's writings from every possible angle.
The bibliography of Aristotelian studies,
already enormous, still continues to grow.
This is mainly due to the extraordinary
diversity of Aristotle's work, which repre¬
sents an essential phase in the development
of ancient Greek thought, to which it
brought a new scientific dimension. To a
great extent, this work has shaped or
crystallized philosophical problems, con¬
cepts and terms for all succeeding gene¬
rations, and has made a decisive contri¬
bution to the development and indeed the
creation of a number of scientific disci¬
plines. Finally, it constitutes the first
methodical attempt to organize morals
and law into a philosophical system and to
lay the foundations for a scientific exami¬
nation of politics.
Seen at a distance of so many centuries,
Aristotle's writings may. appear to us as
something to be taken for granted, an
intellectual treasure of which we happen
to be the fortunate beneficiaries.
Yet this great body of work was brought
forth arduously and gradually, following a
pattern that remained consistent despite
frequent fluctuations and digressions. It
was produced by a man of genius who was
also a tireless worker, in the course of a
life that was marked by ordinary human
vicissitudes such as family losses, personal
disappointment and bitterness, but which
was also enhanced by the support of loyal
friends, by constant contact with Plato,
the supreme philosopher of ancient Greece,
and by the stimulating collaboration of
chosen disciples.
Aristotle was born in 384 B.C. in the
small Greek colony of Stagira on the Chal-
cidic peninsula of Macedonia in northern
Greece. He spent his childhood in Pella,
where his flather, Nicomachus, was court
CONSTANTINE DESPOTOPOULOS, an authority
on the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato, is a professor
at the Panteios School of Political Science in Athens.
Bust of Aristotle in the
Capitol Museum, Rome
physician to Amyntas II of Macedón. He
lost his father at an early age, and at 17 left
for Athens, the centre of Greek civilization.
In Athens he acquired the rich experience
of living in a multi-faceted society, acquain¬
ting himself with all its political, economic
and cultural currents. Above all, he fami¬
liarized himself with the Attic use of lan¬
guage, which the orators and teachers of
rhetoric then cultivated almost to excess,
but which was a magnificent vehicle for
contemporary judgements and observa¬
tions concerning human values.
This was the period when the Academy,
the school of philosophy founded by Plato,
flourished in Athens. At the time of Aris¬
totle's arrival, Plato was absent in Sicily
and the Academy was provisionally headed
by the astronomer and philosopher Eudoxus
of Cnidus. Aristotle became an active
member of the Academy, where he was
to spend 20 years of his life, from 367 to
347 B.C.
During this long and fruitful period,
Aristotle lived in close contact with Plato
and. other eminent thinkers and received
continuous intellectual stimulation from his
association with them. He soon distin- .
guished himself for his acute intelligence
and passionate thirst for knowledge, for his
vigorous mind and dialectical prowess.
Most important of all, he finally emerged
as a totally original and independent thinker.
After Plato's death, Speusippus became
head of the Academy. Aristotle decided
that it was time to leave Athens. He
departed, somewhat embittered at not
being appointed Plato's successor, and
settled in Assus, a little town in the Troad,
in northwest Asia Minor. There, in colla¬
boration with several other Platonists, he
founded his first school, as a kind of annex
to the Academy.
He taught in Assus for three years (347-
344 B.C.) and then moved to Mytilène on
the nearby island of Lesbos. There he
worked for two years on biological research
with Theophrastus, a native of the island,
and also pursued his other studies, particu-,
larly in the field of logic.
At the invitation of King Philip II of
Macedón, son of Amyntas II, Aristotle left
Mytilène in 342 B.C. to return to the court
at Pella, where he was entrusted with the
education of Philip's heir, the future Alex¬
ander the Great, then a 13-year-old boy.
For three years Aristotle concentrated on
this task and then, from 340 to 335 B.C.,
devoted himself more fully to his own
research and writing.
The year 335 B.C. marks the beginning
of the most important period in Aristotle's \
life. Once again he settled in Athens, and t

y founded his second school, the Lyceum,
where for the next 12 years he proved to
be an admirable teacher, a great philoso¬
phical innovator, a creative scientist and an
incomparable organizer of methodical
enquiry by teams of scientists and scholars.
During this time he completed his many-
sided contribution to human thought and
gave final form to his writings, which were
to serve through the ages as a landmark for
those seeking to establish the fundamental
principles of intellectual activity.
In 323 B.C., there was a violent outburst
of anti-Macedonian feeling in Athens.
Aristotle suffered a certain amount of
persecution and escaped to Chalcis, his
mother's birthplace, leaving both the
school and his manuscripts in the care of
Theophrastus. He died in Chalcis a few
months later, a sad and lonely man (1 ).
Content apart, the sheer quantity of
Aristotle's writings constitutes an amazing
achievement. The most important of his
surviving works, which represent barely
one-quarter of his entire output, deal with
many branches of human knowledge,
including logic, physics, biology, meta¬
physics, morals, politics and psychology.
The idea that population
growth should be
controlled In the interests
of balanced economic
development is often
thought to be a modern
one. However, it was
foreshadowed, 2,300 years
ago by Aristotle, who
declared in h\s.Politlcs
that overpopulation
caused poverty, crime and
other social evils.

Universal education is another "modern" idea discussed by Aristotle in
his Politics in the 4th century B.C. He stresses that education must
prepare the citizen to use leisure, for a state that cannot use its leisure
properly will collapse. Above, athletes on a Greek vase.
It is generally accepted that his greatest
achievement was the decisive contribution
which he made to logic. Not only did he
re-examine, supplement and classify his
predecessors' discoveries in this field, he
also enriched them with his own discove¬
ries and finally organized the existing body
of knowledge on the subject into a complete
philosophical science.
Aristotle's works on logic deal with
human thought not only at the scientific
level but also in relation to everyday life.
They are divided into two parts, the analy¬
tical (which is the more important) and the

dialectic. The Analytics, which deals prin¬
cipally with reasoning and logical demons¬
trations, has made an invaluable contribu¬
tion to the methodology of the exact
sciences. The balanced construction of
Euclidean geometry owes much to Aristo¬
tle's Analytics.
However, the "Father of Logic" was
fully aware that reasoning cannot cover the
entire field of the cognitive process, (that
is, the action and faculty of knowing) and
that the knowledge of first principles, on
which we base our judgements and there¬
fore our reasoning, is obtained by a direct
process which is based less on reasoning
than on a kind of intuitive vision.
For Aristotle, reasoning is not the sole
method of enquiry into philosophical and
scientific problems. He also uses obser¬
vation, analogy and the historical-evolu¬
tionist method.
'
... i.
:
When investigating a philosophical
problem, he prefers to begin by analysing
the meaning of words and then proceeds
to an analysis of the subject, including an
exposition of views contrary to his own.
Aristotle's work in the field of physics is
held in lesser esteem today, despite its
undoubted importance. Here he is concer¬
ned with "natural" beings, in other words
those which are endowed with the capacity
for motion, whether in the spatial sense, or
through increase or decrease, or through
mutation. Such beings include animals,
plants and the four"simple bodies" earth,
fire, air and water.
These four elements serve as a starting-
point for Aristotle's explanation of a num¬
ber of changes affecting corruptible natural
beings, without however presupposing any
strict teleology the doctrine that final
goals and purposes rather than mechanical
causes order reality. According to Aristotle,
nature is not to be considered equal to
matter. It is both "daemonic and divine."
In his desire to place physics on a sturdy
theoretical foundation, Aristotle studied
with almost mathematical rigour the infi¬
nite, the void, the continuum, space,
time, motion and energy. He formulated
bold theories, especially concerning the
problem of time, which were to exert a
fruitful influence on later thinkers such as
Newton, Husserl and Bergson.
He also considered the possibility that
the earth might be spherical in shape. A
passage in one of his works is believed to
have encouraged Christopher Columbus
to follow a westerly course in his attempt
to reach the Indies.
Eminent modern biologists have expres¬
sed their admiration for Aristotle's contri¬
bution to the development of this science.
Darwin described Linnaeus as a mere
apprentice in comparison with Aristotle,
whose biological treatises list 500 different
varieties of animals and include a wealth of
information on comparative anatomy and

embryology, as well as the principles of
physiology.
The notion of "organism" appears for
the first time in Aristotle, and the gene¬
ration of life is given a teleological inter¬
pretation, based on the concept of ente-
lechy, the realization or complete expres¬
sion of potentiality.
The soul is considered as a life-giving
principle, the basic condition for existence
in living beings. It both shapes and sustains
the organism, and generates and directs'
motion and sensation, volition and mental
energy.
Aristotle makes a distinction between a
merely "nutritive" soul, such as exists in
plants, a sensitive soul which coexists with
the nutritive soul in animals, and a rational
soul coexisting with the former two in
human beings.
As for psychology, Aristotle was the
forerunner of theoretical trends which were
to emerge in later times in the work of such
thinkers as Kant and Fichte and the foun¬
ders of configurative and associative
psychology.
Among the principal concepts introduced
for the first time in his theory of psychology
are the passions, the faculties or dispo¬
sitions, sensation, appetite, the intellect,
desire and volition.
\ Aristotle's study of morals is the product
of a critical elaboration of the moral beliefs
held by the Greek people and scholars of
his time, and the integration of these
beliefs into his own psychological and
metaphysical concepts, combined with a
philosophical enquiry into man's practical
functions.
The basic concepts of this open-ended
system are: the good, happiness, virtue,
and moral choice a notion which presup¬
poses freedom in a very practical sense.
Happiness is defined as "the activity of the
soul in a state of virtue", in other words as
a condition closely related to freedom,
though dependent on the individual condi¬
tion determined by the circumstances of a
person's life.
Aristotle's theory of law exerted a pro¬
found influence on Roman, late medieval
and modern jurists, particularly his notions
of distributive law, corrective law, contract,
retaliation and leniency. Moralists and
jurists were also much influenced by Aris¬
totle's theory concerning the family.
In his Politics, Aristotle put forward the
notion that man is by nature a political
animal, thus implying that society, in the
political sense, is not an artificial product
but the outcome of something inherent in
human nature. His use of the citizens'
common interest as the supreme criterion
in distinguishing "good" from "bad"
societies emphasized the interdependence
of society and justice.
Aristotle's Politics became widely
known in Western Europe in the late
Middle Ages and made a decisive impact
on modern political science. Political
theories and concepts such as the state,
law, forms of government, the citizen,
politics as the art of the possible, the sepa¬
ration of powers, the antagonism between
rich and poor, can all be found in Aristotle.
The Poetics, only parts of which have
survived, deals mainly with the subject of
artistic creation considered as an imitation
of nature by means of form, colour, sound,
motion and words.
Since the Renaissance, it has proved a
major influence on literature and literary
criticism. His definition of tragedy, in
particular, which features the celebrated
notion of catharsis (purification), has
provided a stimulating source of debate
and comment among many poets and
critics.
However, Aristotle's greatest work is his
Metaphysics, the main subject of which is
the nature of being, which he presents as
an inexhaustible source of conjecture for
the human mind.
This fundamental philosophical work,
which nurtured the philosophy of medieval
Europe, as well as Arabic philosophy (with
certain variations), still provides the
groundwork for the philosophical doctrine
of the Catholic Church. In it, Aristotle
advanced such important dual concepts as
form-and-matter and potentiality-and-
actuality, the first designating the structure
of each being and the second the move¬
ment of each being towards realization.
He also posited and envisaged such
eschatological problems as the generation
and corruption of beings as opposed to
the eternity of the world; the first cause
and the principles which activate the world;
and finally the fundamental concept of
human conscience which Descartes was
to formulate many centuries later when he
wrote: "Cogito, ergo sum" (I think, there¬
fore I am).

RUBENS AFTER
FOUR CENTURIES
Sir,
The issue celebrating the 400th anniver¬
sary of Rubens' Birth (June 1877) would
have been a boon for philatelists, if only
you had devoted more space to the stamps
issued in the great painter's honour (page
18).
Perhaps readers would be interested to
know that the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications has issued a series
of stamps in honour of Rubens consisting
of a sheet and 5 separate stamps. The
5 stamps show works by Rubens in the
Hermitage Museum, Leningrad: "Alliance
of Earth and Water", "The Carters", "Lion
Hunt", "The Rainbow" and "Portrait of a
Lady" (shown here). On the sheet are a
Rubens self-portrait with (at left) a detail

SOLAR ENERGY
FOR THE THIRD WORLD
Sir,
Erik P. Eckholm's article on the poor
man's energy crisis caught my attention in
your excellent issue entitled "A Halt to
Desert Advance" (July 1977).
There is a shortage of firewood in many
regions of the world, but there seems to be
no shortage of strong sunlight. This
suggests a possible remedy.
Why not introduce domestic solar cookers
in these regions? Given current advances
in technology, this should be possible. If
the project was successful, it would relieve
the poor of the Third World of the heart¬
breaking search for firewood and give the
forests a chance to grow again.
Finally, I believe that any notion of profit
from such an invention for the poor of the
Third World should be ruled out. The
reward may lie in this quotation from the
Prophet Isaiah: "Then shall the light rise
up in darkness and thy darkness shall be as
the noonday."
Sean O. Cadhla

Sir,
I am 86 years old, but I still think about
the future and so I was particularly interested
by Erik Eckholm's article drawing attention
to the alarming rate at which wood is being
used up in some parts of the world.
It is hard to know how to brake the massi¬
ve consumption of wood as a heating fuel
in the poor regions of Asia, Africa and
South America. However, in some of these
regions which have a sunny climate, sun¬
light could replace wood as an energy-
source. , Parabolic reflectors could be mass-
produced for this purpose, possibly in dural-
min. In spite of the costs involved, this
would be a vast improvement on the whole¬
sale destruction of trees.

Wear and tear
on Athens' Holy Rock
«m .
year immense crowds of visitors
(one-and-a-half million in 1976) tramp over
the Acropolis, steadily wearing down the
steps, pavements and rock. Air pollution is '
also wreaking havoc on the marble
monuments and sculptures such as the
Caryatids, the figures that support the roof
of the Erechtheum. The Caryatids have been
so badly damaged that they may have to be
replaced, at least temporarily, with replicas.
Left, a craftsman at work on a casting of
a Caryatid made of cement, sand and
marble dust.
