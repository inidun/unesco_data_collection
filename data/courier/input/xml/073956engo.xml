APRIL 19t9.
Dr. Torres Bodet confers with President Truman at the White House during a visit of the Unesco Director-General to Wash-'ington on Aprit 5. Standing : Asst. Secretary of State George V. Alien.
Unesco Can Aid U. N. Plan
For Under-Devetoped Areas.,
NESCO can make an important
contribuLon to the United Na-
tions plan. to give technical assis-
trance to the under-developed areas of
the world. Or. Jaime Torres Bodet de-
Ü9red in Washington earlv this month.
After calling on President Truman at
the-White House on April 5 to express
appreciation for the"outstanding work"
the United States has done for Unesco,
Torres Bodet told newsmen in Washing-
ton that he"'warmly welcomed"the
'revolution which the Economic and
Social Council of the U. N. had adopted
on March 4.
This resolution requests Trygve Lie,
in consultation with the Specialized
Agencies, to submit a plan to ECOSOC
xefore its meetng m July,. for the tech-
u'c9l and economic development of less
t>dv&néed countries.
"This generous and at the same time
realistic initiative is in full harmony with
the mission of the United Nations and es-
pecially of Unesco. since education is a
necessary corollary to economic develop-
ment,"Torres Bodet declared.
RECALLING that"the impetus for de-veloping this programme came ori-
ginally from President Truman", the
Unesco chief added :"By focusing world
attention on the problem of under-
developed areas, Mr. Truman, in my
opinion, has made a very great contri-
bution to the cause of peace. Giving
assistance to the under-privileged masses
who have been by-passed by progress in
many parts of the world is a constructive
goal for international co-operation."
"The educational and scientific aspects
Tories rodent
y
of the programme", he continued,"are
just as important as technical assistance.
The latter will be largely wasted if the
inhabitants of the regions which are being
assisted are not. educated to make the
best possible use of the economic assis-
tance. Furthermore, any tare-scale
programme of the kind which is con-
templated has important cultural im-
plications. As their technological level
rises, backward peoples must be helped
to adapt their cultural independence... If
you are going to train their hands, you
must also teach their minds."
Recalling that"a strict system of
priorities for all Unesco activities this
year"had been set up, Torres Bodet
s : lid :"We are giving top priority to pro-
jects which directly support the United
Nations plans for under-developed areas."
HE called attention to Unesco's educa-tonal missions in such countries as
Siam, the Philippines and Afghanistan,
to the educational seminars for setting up
campaigns to combat illiteracy in India
and Brazil, and to the clearing-house and
experimental work in fundamental edu-
cation which includes the teaching of
elementary hygiene and scientific agri-
culture.
The Director-General also stressed the
value of Unesco's achievements in estab-
lishing field science co-operation offices
in Cairo, Delhi, Shanghai and Montevideo,
in stimulating scientific research in the
various problems peculia.. to under-
developed areas, in obtaining fellowships
in the more advanced countries for
scholars from under-developed areas, and
in surveying the press, film and radio
needs in these areas.
He pointed out, however, that"the
scope of all this work cannot but be res-
triced because of our lack of adequate
resources,"since Unesco's total budget
is fixed at $7, 780. 000."What is now re-
qü ; red," he added,"is a : 1 effort on an
altogether different scale."
Referring to a recent meeting with
Mr. Trygve Lie, Torres Bodet reported
that he had assured the U. N. chief that
"Unesco will co-operate in this enterprise
to the fullest extent."He announced that
four Unesco officials were participating
1n the preliminary drafting of the Joint
Plan for under-developed areas, which
will ultimately be submitted to ECOSOC.
"We think that from this preparatory
stage onwards,"Dr. Torres Bodet said,
"Unesco is in a position to make a
valuable contribution. The human ele-
ment remains the decisive factor in all
technical and economic progress. If
technical assistance is to produce eco-
nomic effects that are deep and lasting...
it must be based on an effort in the
sphere of education-not merely techni-
cdl education : 1, but also fundamental and
even scientific education."

Ra'lly At

'..'fHAT Unesco has done and what it
"'. most do was dramatically pre-
sented to over 3, 000 delegates at a
three-day conference of the U. S. National
Commission for Unesco which began on
March 31 at Cleveland, Ohio.
The conference, one of the most com-
prehensive ever held by a Unesco. Na-
tional Commission, drew representatives
from hundreds of national organizations.
and leaders from all parts of the United
States, as well as officials and observers
from many others countries.
On April 1, in the great main audito-
rium of the Cleveland City Hall, which
had been decked with 8-foot high spark-
ling silver letters spelling out UNESCO
Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet spoke on"Unèsco
- A Personal Faith", and Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
On the stage, backed by the 46 flags
of Unesco's Member States, sat Dr. Milton
S. Eisenhower, president of the U. S. Com-
mission ; Mr. George V : Allen. Assistant
Secretary of State ; Dr. George D. Stod-
dard. president of the University ol
Illinois ; M. Henri Laugier, Assistant
Secretary General of the United Nations ;
and Sir John Maud, Permanent Under-
Secretary to the British Ministry of Edu-
cation.
Calling for a,"great crusade"for the
maintenance of peace through education,
Dr. Torres Bodet said :"Peace has to be
built in the slums and in the villages.
That is where most people live-and li,'e
under conditions which constitute a per-
manent threat to peace. About two-
thirds of the human race are forgotten.
and the most forgotten thing about them
is their minds."
And the Director-General added :"So
long as there are two groups of peoples-
the one privileged, supplied with first-
class universities, laboratories and librar-
ies, the other backward, for whom even
primary school is luxury, there can be no
true international peace of a just and
lasting character." (For the full text of
Dr. Torres Bodet's address. see Page 3.)
Speaking on the subject"Making
Human Rights Come Alive". Mrs. Roose-
velt described the U. N. Declaration as
"an educational document"and called on
peoples and nations to make it a"living
document".

Under-developed
Areas
' (Continued from Page 1)
He quoted the ECOSOC resolution which
recognizes this need :"paying due atten-
tion to questions of a social nature which
directly conditions economic develop-
ment."
HE pointed out to correspondents thatUnesco s ExecutlVe Bcard, at a special
session convened in Paris on March 24,
had approved several concrete proposals
on the Organization's possible contribu-
tions to the programme for technical
assistance.
These proposals, he said, bear on the
scientific study of regional problems af-
fecting the development of backward
areas, the technical training of personnel,
education of entire populations and cam-
paigns against illiteracy, as well as adult
education in hygiene, agriculture, handi-
ccafts and industry.
SPEAKING in detail on the plan fort-. th ooucat ; on of whole popul tions,
the Unesco chief had said :"Men are
not robots. All human activity is the
necessary outcome of a state of mind.
It is quite impossible to imagine technical
training worthy of the name, that is.
training which is not mere mechanical
filling, without it being based on fun-
damental education and accompanied by
general education. Backward peoples can-
not be taught working methods and the
rules of hygiene, of private and com-
munity life. which the modern technical
age has developed, unless they have suf-
ficient mental training o understand the
explanations and reasons of those prac-
tices. Othclwise man is either unable to
use the instmments of his emancipation
or else he becomes an instrument himself.
The first essential for any technological
and Economic progress is therefore to
raise the standard of education of the
general population."
Other projects outlined by the Director'-
General in Washington included the use
vf media of mass communication, pro-
motion of primary education, and the
promotion of scientific information and
research.
THE Unesco Director-General stressedthe fact that th  plan to aid backward
areas must not be impaired by"mediocre
results".- p
"If a lack of
lufficient resources
were to confine us
to superficial efforts
or token activity"
he told correspon-
dents,"this would
mean an intense
disappointment for
the peoples of the
underdeveloped re-
gions."
In discussing his
meeting with Pre-
sident Truman,
Torres Bodet ex-
pressed pleasure at
discovering that the
President was thor-
oughly acquainted
with the details of
TJnesco's program-
me. It was an"ins-
piration", he said,
o learn that despite
neavy responsabili-
ties as Chief Execu-
tive of the United
States, President
Truman could find
time to keep such
e 1 0 5 e track of
Unesco's activities.
(Continued

"The beginning
can only be made",
she said,"if we
make the Declara-
tion a living docu-
ment, something
that is not just
words on paper
but... which we
really strive to
bring into the lives
of all peoples."
On the opening
day of the confer-
ence. Dr. Eisen-
hower emphasized
the importance
that the people of
the United States
are giving to the
work and aims of
Unesco."Each of
the organizations
on the National
Commission-a n d
they have a com-
bined total of some
40 million members
- has made Unesco
one of its major
projects", he ex-
plained.
The U. S. Assis-
tant Secretary of
State also stressed
the importance of
Unesco's direct con-
tact with individ-
uals of all coun-
tries."Unesco", Mr.
Al1en said,"comes
nearer to being an
international or-
ganization made up
of millions of hu-
man beings than
any other inter-
governmental body
yet created...
"The Job of Unesco is to create a world
community, in which private individual
everywhere feel that they belong not only
to a nation but are also citizens of what

GIFTS of U. S. technical and scientificbooks will be sent to foreign schools
and libraries in Europe and Asia under
a new programme sponsored by CARE,
the Co-operative for American Remit-
tances to Europe.
The programme was announced at the
second U. S. National Conference for
Unesco by Mr. Murray B. Lincoln,
President of CARE.
Mr. Lincoln declared that the book
programme is a practical way in which
the people of the United States can aid
Unesco's efforts towards educational re-
construction. He said that the latest &nd
best U. S. books will be selected to meet
needs in countries who : th suffered from

over 7, 500, 000 food and clothing packages to needy countries,

mined by CARE missions in co-operation
with Unesco, foreign ministries, education,
and other authoritative sources. CARE
will be guided in its selections by a com-
mittee headed by Luther Evans, head of
the U. S. Library of Congress.
Included on the committee will be
members of the American Library Asso-
ciation and the U. S. Book Exchange.
"I feel there will be popular support
for this programme, for the people of the
United States have given CARE 75 million
dollars in the past for food and clothing
packages,"Lincoln said."For the new
book programme, the publishers have
assured CARE of their support and co-
operation by giving a discount on the
books purchased."
Mr. Lincoln pointed cut that during
the past two years his organization has
distributed more than seven and a half
million, food and clothing packages
overseas.
M : ! ton S. Elsenhower, Chairman of the
U. S. National Commission for Unesco,
heartily endorsed the new book pro-
gramme, which is scheduled to s : art on
May 15. Present plans are to send the
books in block shipments to institutions
designated by Unesco and other agencies.
The general categories of books to be
sent overseas include health and welfare,
nursing, medicine, dentistry, agricultural
science, veterinary science, and English
language instruction. In the field of
applied science there will be books on
biology, chemistry, engineering, geology,
mathematics, physics, physiology, psycho-
logy, and sociology.
Countries to which CARE will offer the
book programme include Austria, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, Finland, Italy, France,
Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Great Britain, the American, British and
French zones of Germany, Berlin, Korea.
and Japan. Only unused books will be
shipped.
two further Unesco's objectives.
Making use of various devices, such aa
exhibits, demonstrations, films, round-
table and panel discussions, and radio,
nationally known figures took leading
roles in dramatizing six major topics : edu-
nationally known figures took leading
persons, the United Nations, Hum. in
Rights, education, and the advancement
of world civilization through the arts and
sciences.
With these discussions as a basis, dele-
gates examined specific methods of UMUvt-
dual participation in Unesco's work
through the. mass media, schools And
colleges, adult education, libraries, busi-
ness, farm and civic organizations.
For example, farm leaders, representing
farm organizations from 16 states, demon-
strated"down to earth"rural participa-
tion in Unesco's work. They described
their"Get to know the United Nations"
programmes which include carefully
planned discussion groups, county"mis-
sionary"work by trained farm leaders
and the screening of films on intern.
tional matters of concern to farmers.
One of the highlights of the conference
was the premiere performance of the
"Freedom Symphony", played by the
Cleveland Symphony Orchestra and con-
ducted by Mr. Howard Hanson, president
of the U. S. National Music Council. The
music for the Symphony was based on
extracts from compositions by leading
American composers. It accompanied the
reading of statements found in history's
greatest freedom documents-from the
Magna Carta to the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights..
A NEW WORD
IS COINED-
'UNESCAN''
NEW word
/SL-UNES-
CAN-
was coined on
March 31, On the
opening day of
the Second U. S.
National Confer-
rence on Unesco,
in Cleveland,
Ohio.
Speaking on
"The A c h i e v e-
ments and Pro-
mise of Unesco"
Sir John Maud,
Permanent Se-
cretary of the Mi-
nistry of Educa-
tion of the Uni-
ted Kingdom and
a member of
Unesco's Execu-
tive Board, used
the word unescan
for the first time
to describe a per-
son who takes
part in Unesco
activity.
Two days later.
the U. S. Assis-
tant Secretary of
State for Public
Affairs, George V. Allen, who spOke
on"Unesco and the United Nations",
! aid special emphasis on Sir John
Maud's use of the new word.
"Perhaps the term may eventually
come into general use,"Mr. Allen said,
"to describe any citizen of the world
who is willing to acknowledge his re-
sponsibility to humanity as a whole.
To become a Une5can we need to
broaden our concepts and to realize
that while we are Americans, English-
men, or Mexicans, we are at the same
time citizens of a world community to
which we have responsibilities, and to
which we recognize some common
fealty as members of one human race.
A North Carolinian or a Kansan can
be a good American, and an American
can be a good Unescan.
"Dr. Torres Bodet refers often to
Unesco as an organization through
which human beings everywhere speak
directly with each other. His hope. I
am confident, is that the Unesco Se-
cretariat itself can eventually deal
with individuals not merely as Ameri-
cans, Frenchmen, or Brazilians, but
also as Unescans."

On April 1, on the occasion of tlu
Second National Conference of the
C/ ? : : <e [ ! StatM 7Vo< : 07K ! : Com ?/t ! ss ! o ? tUnited States Nati nal Commission
for Unesco, Dr. Jaime Torres Bodet
addressed a public audience of almost
10, 000 persons on"Unesco-A Personal
Faith". This address, which was widely
applauded by delegates and visitors
attending the conference. is reproduced
in full below.
By J. TORRES BODET
Director-General
II am deeply grateful to the United
States National Commission and to
the citizens of Cleveland for his
opportunity to speak to you. This is not
my first visit to your country. It has,
however, a special significance for me,
because it is my first visit as Director-
General of Unesco.
I am happy to be with you and haJpPY'
IiU to greet on this
platform tonight
one of your most
distinguished citi-
zens-Mrs. Eleanor
Roosevelt. Her work
in furthering the
international u n-
d e l's tan d ing to
which you are all
committed has long
been remarkable.
Most recently,
her signal efforts
in helping the com-
pletion of the Uni-
versal Declaration
of Human Rights
in the Assembly of
the United Nations
have renewed the
world's hope that
mankind will use
the victory of the
last war to build a
better world for all
men to live in. This
indeed has been an
objective long asso-
ciated with the il-
lustrious name she
bears. It is also the
objective of Unesco.
Unesco is an or-
ganization, main-
tained by forty-six
governments, i n-
eluding your own,
to administer cer-
tain human in-
te. rests which they
aU have in com-
mon. By your Gov-
ernment's partici-
pation in it, you, as American citizens,
have both rights and obligations with
regard to this Organization.
Through your participation in the work
of Unesco, and in many other ways, you
are making a major contribution to the
cause of human progress. In you I salute
greatness achieved and greatness yet to
come : the strength of a young nation.
But what strikes me most is not the
imme : lse material force of your country.
It i3 the fact that in your universities and
colleges, libraries and many other na-
tional and community voluntary organiza-
tions. men and women like you are
struggling to uphold those spiritual values
that preserve a nation's virtue from cor-
ruction-the fellowship of men, respect
for ma : l as an individual, and respect, for
civilization as an assertion of freedom.
A man possesses nothing, if he doe. 
not use what he has for the well-being of humanity. In a country
like yours, with its huge resources, theN
may indeed be groups of people who are
concerned to use the fruit of their labour
in order to increase their own power and
influence. But you, educators, scientists,
artists and civic leaders, know as well M
I do that the lust for power often deflects
nations from their natural destiny.
Power is built up only to fall, unless it
rests on the one solid basis-the basis of
the spirit. The continual struggle to
preserve the moral basis of a nation's
strength-through the arts. education and
thought-is the strong. east bulwark of
national security.
That is why, in the recent war, below.
your soldiers had come home, you declar-
ed yourselves in favour of a just and
worthy peace. In the Fall of 1945, your
delegates came to London to plead the
cause of international co-operation through
education, science and culture.
As the delegate of my country, I was
able, in the capital of Great Britain, to see
the efforts which your representatives
were making. And may I tell you frankly
that of all your victories the one that
Impressed me most was that supreme vic-
tory over yourselves, ; when you decided, in
the hour of triumph, to erect no walls of
hatred between victors-and vanquished.but to clear the Path to understanding.
'its THE UNESCO
APPROACH WRONG ?'
) m T was thus that Unesco was broughtto birth. What were the arguments
i : 1 favour of its creation ? They are
summed up in the preamble to our Cons-
titut Hon. Let me recall to your minds one
of rhOs document's most striking clauses :
"that a peace based exclusively upon
the po ! tt ! co ! nKft eeo ; t0 ? tt : c ftrroTte-poli ical and econ mic arrange-
ments oaf governments would not be a
peace wh : ch could secure the una-
nimous, lasting and sincere support
or the peoples of the world and that
the peace must therefore be rounded,
if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual
and moral solidarity of mankind".
The words I have just read to you still
throb with the spirit that gave Unesco
life Maybe, our post-war difficulties
he. : e modified a little of that"first fine
ca ;'cless rapture."We are daily faced, and
faced more clearly, with the fact that
while everyone, as an individual, yearns
for peace, the horizon is clouded with the
tragic menace of fresh wars.
Does that mean that the Unesco ap-
proach was wrong? ? I say emphatically-
no. In my opinion what is wrong is that
the Unesco approach has not yet been
seriously tried. Concerned with organizing
their political and economic life, govern-
ments do not always attach the same
importance to the moral condition which
furnish that political and economic life
with its strongest support in the hearts
and minds of men. Thus the concept or
interdependence often takes precedencp
over the concept of solidarity. Unhappily
the interdepe : 1dence o. ! governments,
without the solidarity of nations, is not
enough to avert the dangers of war.
Stunted Minds Breed War
WAR can always be made between
'l {fVl/ ! f the great capitals. Peace has to
be built in the slums and in the
villages. That is where most people live'-
and live under conditions which constitute
a permanent threat to peace. About two-
thirds of the human race are forgotten
men-and the most forgotten thing about
them is their minds.
About half of the human race is totally
illiterate.
A very small percentage of all the adults
in the world have had the equivalent of
a full high-school education. A much
smaller fraction can be considered really
educated men and women. The fact that
this handful of intellectuals has attai : 1ed
a level of education unprecedented in
history does not lessen the gravity. of the
situation. On the contrary, it increase it.
I know that you do not need to be cof-
vinced that the unequal distributiox of
food and material, wealth in the world ill
a menace to peace. But, inequalities in the
access to knowledge and to technical skilla
may be as great a menace to peace as
those inequalities in the access to raw
materials about, which we used to hear so
much. Stunted minds breed war.
II T is for this reason that no pro-gramme for raising standards of
living, for insuring the world with
greater prosperity is possible, or indeed
has any prospect of success unless it K
accompanied by programmes of educate. : Q
for the development of men's minds, theQ
spirit, and their moral strength.
In this connexion I have read with great
iaterest the resolution of the ECOSOC
calling upon the United Nations and
Specialized Agencies to submit propose
for the economic development of under-
developed territories. Unesco is giv : IJ/f
careful study to this question to determine
what its, best contribution may be.
History shows that, wherever the few
are too highly educated, and the many tao
ignorant, there tend to arise energeU8
individuals or groups whose minds are a
terrifying mixture of ignorance and end. 
cation, of intelligence and brutality, of
savagery and progress.
This mixture is the most deadly social
explosive that we know. Therefore I
maintain that the most dangerous divisvon
in the world is the O : 1e between educa-
tion and ignorance, between the CtDo
turally-privileged and the culturally-undee*
privileged, between the intellectual"have""
and the intellectual"have-nots".
'A GRIM REALITY'
IN any country, so long as there are,on the one hand, people who can
command all the benefits of tech-
nical progress in education and science
and, on the other hand, vast numbers
who are illiterate, there can be no real
social peace. And, in the world, so long as
there are two groups of peoples-the O : 1e
privileged, supplied with first-class uni-
versities, laboratories and libraries, the
other backward, for whom even a primary
school is a luxury, there can be no true
mternational peace of a just and lasting.
character.
Too fe. w people admit or understand this
grim reality. Perhaps that is why we
sometimes hear Unesco ridiculed as an
Ol'R3 :,'z : llion of dreamers and idealist*.
For we are aware of the problem and
. we are trying to do something about it.
Our means are feeble. You cannot bring
education, science and culture to all the
forgotten men and forgotten minds of
the world with a budget which is less than
eight million dollars a year. But let me
ask you : Which is more unrealistic-to
work at the foundations of peace with
inadequate tools, or to start putting urn
the house before the foundation has been
laid ?
THE problem of co-ordination ofefforts is more difficult in our case,
perhaps, than in the case of the
other Specialized Agencies of the United
Nations. Unesco's work takes place, so to
speak, at the third remove : questions
submitted to us must previously have been
considered by the National Commissions
a : led by the Governments. If the National
Commissions do not work diligently
enough, or if the governments place
obstacles in the way of the Commission'*
activities, Unesco cannot do its. Jot*.
Fortunately, this does not happen in your
country. I would like to take this occasion
to voice my admiration for the work which
your National Commisison is doinlt for
the execution of the Unesco programme.
Since I cannot, today, express my thanks
to each one of you individually, let me
thank you through the person of'your
Chairman.
Dr. Eisenhower, your own tireless
labours in the cause of Unesco are an
inspiration to all of us. Under your
brilliant leadership, the U. S. National
Commission is an example of free and
well organized ability. As Director-General
of Unesco, I rejoice at that and am happy
to con ! lratulate you most warmly upon it.
As you know,
Unesco was direct-
ed by the General
Conference at
Beirut to give wide
publicity to the
Universal Declara-
tion of Human
Rights, and we
have accordingly
made Hum4"Il
Rights the subject
of one of our main
programme activi.
ties for the year.
As part or this
campaign I wrote
to all the National
Commissions in the
Member States re-
commending that
they take active
steps to publicize
the Declaration.
In his reply on
behalf of your Na-
tional Commission.
Dr. Eisenhower aso
sured me that,
apart from other
action the Commis-
sion is taking, this
meeting in Cleve-
land wou) d empha*
size Human Rights
as one of its major
themes. I am hap.
py to see how ear.
fectively this proat-
ise has been real-
iaed and again I
would like to thank
Mrs. Roosevelt for
the support sre i. t
giving our work by her presence hare.
Surely no one is better fitted in bringing
home to the masses the importance of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
. Unesco Cannot Go A. head
Wit/lOut the Support oj
the Great Masses'
UNESCO cannot go ahe. ad. without thesupport of the great masses whic ! t
make up public opinion. Unesco Watt
. 5P. t up to promote international under-
fitandi : 1g throughout the world ; it must
begin by making itself understood buy
men throughout the world. Hitherto.
despite the efforts of the secretariat and
of my distinguishes predecessor, we have
not made much progress along that road.

UNESCO COURIER April 1949
(Continued from Pa&"e 3)
The National Commissions of Unesco's
Member States must clearly understand
that one of their main functions is to
briag Unesco into direct contact with the
people. We, in our work, often need spe-
c : aJists. technicians and experts ; but the
greatest fruits of our efforts must be
enjoyed by the greatest number. The man
in the street must not remain unaware
that Unesco exists and is thinking of him.
His distress, he anxieties, and his desires
are the best reasons for our existence.
WE NEED NATIONAL COMMISSIONS suoa
AS YOURS. THESE COMMISSIONS MUST MUL-

Cornie-Strips As a
Constructive Force
HERE is another great force in yourcountry whic  could be harnessed to
constructive ends. I refer to your
tomic-strips, which are gaining such popu-
Jarity throughout the world-so much,
indeed, that. in certain Gentries, alarm
has been expressed at the influence which
they have upon young minds. I think
myself that this influence is often harm-
furl. But it need not be. It could be a
wholesome influence.
For example, your most talented cosmic-
etrip artists might more frequently weave
into their stories characters portraying
foreigners and members of under-privileg-
ed minority groups within your own coun-
try in a sympathetic light. That would be
a good contribution to the work of Unesco
- and to the social health of your country.
Comics should be used also to tell the
story off, what each nation has contributed
to our civilization-especially what they
have contributed to the development of
human rights. This would be aiding one of
Unesco's main campaigns.
Such th : ngs could not be done to order
or by decree in a country like yours,
which owes its astounding progress to
Initiative, free enterprise and free associa-
tion. But much could be done by a cam-
paign of patient and sustained persuasion.
It is a natural pursuit of children two
form"excursion clubs"and, from their
schools. to exchange letters. messages,
stamps and so forth. Why not take the
opportunity of founding clubs of young
"Friends of Unesco" ? Their members
would practise in their communities and
homes the principles of social life advocat-
ed by Unesco and so, to the experience
i. hey have gained of their own country,
they would add a knowledge of the world,
a united world. Like chanty, Unesce
begins at biome.
One of Humanity's
Cravest Problems
I HERE aje two Unesco campaignswhich I hope you will push forward
even more vigorously than you
have in the past. One is the"Food and
People"drive-the programme of mass
education in which we are co-operating
with the United Nations Food and Agri-
culture Organization to make people
throughout the world aware of one of
humanity's gravest problems.
Surely there are few better ways of
promoting the moral and intellectual
solidarity of mankind than to make the.
world understand that our grandchildren
are going to starve and wars will be
encouraged unless we co-operate in utiJiz-
1n all the possibilities of science to pre-
serve and develop our food resources.
"It is a natural pursuit of children to form'excuson clubs'
and, from their schools, to exchange letters, messages, stamps

of young'Friends of Unesco' ? Their members would practise
in their communities and homes the principles of social life
advocated by Unesco and so, to the experience they have gained
of their own country, they would add a knowledge of the world."
'IT IS THE FOUNDATIONS
OF CIVILIZATION WE HAVE
TO RECONSTRUCT'
THE other campaign which I hopeHj you will intensify is the one on
behalf of educational reconstruction
in. war-devastated countries. Through the
voluntary organizations and the United
States National Commission with which
Unesco is co-operating, the American
people have already contributed gener-
ously to this cause. From the bottom. of
my heart, I thank you. But let me plead
with you not to relax your efforts, or
curb your generosity. The need is as
great as ever, and it is more than a.
humanitarian need.
It is the foundations of civilization
whICh lIVe have to reconstruct-founda-
tions that were already too narrow and
too precarious before war blasted them
away in many lands. Remember that it
was not merely the fruits of yesterday's
civilization which war destroyed, but the
This was recognized in your country
as early as 1914, when a bill was introduc-
ed into your House of Representatives
calling for an international educational
fund-to be administered by an interna-
tional committee of educators-for the
very purpose we have in mint. In one
way we have made progress since then,
for Unesco now exists to do this work.
On the other hand, the bill to which
I refer proposed that all governments
participating in the international educa-
tional fund should contribute to it one
per cent of their annual military budgets.
If this principle were applied to Unesco
our budget would not, at it is, be less than
eight million dollars-it would be many
times that amount. At present, when
Member States apply to us for advice in
developing their educational programmes,
we feel like a doctor prescribing costly
remedies to a patient who has not t. he
money to buy them.
Cultural Uniformity :
Â Spiritual Disaster
'mA/HEN I speak of educational and
WHEN economic a-ssistance in raising
the cultural level of under-privi-
leged countries. I am not thinking of a
specific form of culture, however fine it
might be. In my opinion, uniformity
would be a spiritual disaster, amounting
to the loss of all that is most original
and typical in any nation : its language.
its art, its thought, its view of life and
of beauty-its soul, in fact.
Funds collected for assistance of this
sort could, of course, be administered by
an international body ; but they would
have to be used in accordance with the
laws, and on behalf of the educational
systems, of the countries which accept
the assistar. oe.
Then, again, when
I speak of the need
to combat ignoran-
ce in order to

place no exaggerat-
ed belief in what
the schools alone
can do for social
reconstruction.
UNESCO hasbeen given the
task of work-
ing through the
scools to promote
the ideals of jus-
tice toward all
countries and res-
pect for the dignity
of every man. But
if, as Director-
General of Unesco,
I said to you :"In
a world wnose
thoughts are fixed
on war, the schools
alone wits be
enough to educate
mankind for peace",
then I should be
wrong. The schools
are not enough ; the
writers, artists and
poets are not enough. Schools worthy
of the life which we desire demand a
life worthy of the schools we seek. The
ruler in his decisions. the statesman In
his speeches ; the scientISt in the appli-
cation of his discoveries ; the journalist
in the drafting of his articles ; the woman
in her daily household tasks, every one
- I say every single one-is a potential
educator for peace.
Teacher and the
BIt/I-Fight
A all of you have heard of bull-fights.
AS I used to go to them occasionally
when I was young. I thought I
liked them until, one day, I found I did
not. And when I realized why, I made a
firm resolve to go no more to entertain-
ments of that kind. What I realized then
was that, at bull-fights, the public feels
brave because it is applauding the pro-
fessional who risks his life against the
bull. It feels brave-but what the speeta"
tors are doing is enjoying the fC1wards
of courage by proxy. They pay for a
professional to be brave on their behalf
for two or three hours, and that gives
them pleasure and makes them feel tough
In quite a number of cases, something
very similar takes place in education.
People cheer on the teacher and delegate
to him the task of being friendly, under-
standing, fair, frank and peaceful. But
nobodycanbekindlyor courageous through
another ; he can be so only through his
own personal effort. No one can live
eur lives for us, save ourselves. In other
wcrds, we must not make of the educator
what Nietzsche would probably have
christened"Virtue's gladiator". Let us not
lounge on the benches above the arena
while, on the sand below, the teacher
bottles against the forces of rancour and
ignorance. Let us accept the responsibil-
ities which the need to save peace imposes
on us. I give you my solemn assurance
that Unesco will not cease to bear its.
part of the burden.
'WHY NOT UNDERTAKE
A GREAT CRUSADE IN PEACE
AS ! N WAR ?'
"For me, Unesco is not merely an insti-
tution. It is a personal faith. If I
believe in Unesco, it is because I
know that peace is worth more than war,
and education more than propaganda,
just as truth is better than a lie, and
light is better than darkness. Men can-
not live without struggling, but if men
are to struggle, it should be against

These are really the irreparable losses. I
know you will not let them go on.

CAN WE FEED THE MILLIONS OF EXTRA MOUTHS THAT ARE BEING ADDED TO THE
WORLD EVERY YEAR ? ARE WE MAKING FULL USE OF ALL THE NEW RESOURCES OF AGRI-
CULTURAL SCIENCE ? UNESCO PAMPHLETS KEYNOTE WORLD DISCUSSIONS.
II N the last one hundred and fifty years, there have
been three major alarms in regard to the wood's
rising population and the inadequacies of food
supplies : one by Thomas R. Malthus in 1798, a second by
Sir William Crookes exactly one century later, and the
third during the last few years. The first two alarms
proved to be false. Will today's also prove to be a false
alarm ?
Some experts say yes-others are less optimistic. Both
groups agree, however, that the world's food resources
are being used very unevenly and very wastefully, and
recognize that the world cannot afford this at a time
when population is growing at a rate which now exceeds
20, 000. 000 persons a year. The growth threatens to
outstrip our food resources unless something is done
soon to re-establish the balance. This is one of the art-
. manding problems Qf our times.
Unesco has selected"Food and People"as a major
discussion topic for this year and has issued a call to
discussions groups throughout the world to Rive attention
to'his challenge.
Fn order to focus public opinion and stimulate discus-
sion in schools, colleges, local clubs, civic organization.)
and adult education groups, Unesco asked experts in'. he

the problems involved.

of mankind. Sir John Russell fires back, almost in t"1t&i.
disagreement, emphasizing particularly the incalculable
possibilities of scientific advancement.
As in all the forthcoming pamphlets which Unesco
will sponsor throughout the campaign, the views
expressed are the authors'own, whether optimistic or
pessimistic.
The British and American editions of the Huxle7-
Russell pamphlets have been published by the Bureau
of Current Affairs in London (1) and by". Science
Service"in Washington (2),
The Current Affairs booklet, which sells for 9d., con-
tains valuable suggestions and Questions to guide discus-
sion groups for the entire series."Why not turn your'
first session into a formal or informal debate ?", the
Current Affairs pamphlet writes."Either get two mem-
bers of the group to outline briefly the case, first as out
by Huxley and then by Russell, then throw it open to the
group. Or else, having chosen your opening speakers, let
the rest of the group divide off into"optimists"lind
"pessimists" ; and let fly in debate. A good idea would he
to let each side study in advance only the article that
supports their own view-then see how they stand up
to attack."
Spanish and French editions of the entire"Food and

Editorial Sud-Americana of Buenos-Aires and by a
French publisher in Paris.

A'off the important means being used to stimulate
discussion in all parts of the world, it is not the sole
method. Working in collaboration with the United Na-
tions, FAO and WHO, Unesco is organizing campaigns
for radio discussions, film treatment, exhibitions and
filmstrips for community and national groups in
different countries.
The Unesco World Review weekly radio programme
for example, is denoting one programme a month to an
aspect of'Food and People".
In the Union of South Africa, Belgium and Iran,
World Federation of the United Nations AssociatiJI1S
have already launched detailed discussion on"Food and
People"problems in their own countries. The WFUNA
summer school, which is scheduled to open in Geneva
in August, will devote one entire week to this question
and will offer a training programme for discussion
leaders from over 20 countries. Unesco will provide train-
ing for discussion teachers to map out plans of action.

THE human race is passing through
M a time of crisis, and that crisis
M exists, o to speak, on two levels-
an upper level of political and
economic crisis and a lower level crisis
in population and world resources. That
which is discussed at international con-
ferences and in the newspapers is the
upper level crisis-the crisis whose imme-
diate causes are the economic breakdown
due to the War and the struggle for
power between groups possessing, or about
to posses, the means of mass extermina-
tion. Of the low-level crisis, the crisis in
population and world resources, hardly
anything is heard in the press, on the
radio or at the more important interna-
tional conferences.
Yet the low-level crisis is at least as
serious as the crisis in the political and
economic field. Moreover, the problems
on the upper level cannot be solved
'without reference to the problems that are
taking shape in the comic and biolog : cal
basement. If it is ignored, the low-level
crisis is bound to sharpen the crisis on
the political and economic levels. At the
same time, a concentration of attention
and energy on power politics and power
economics will make a solution of the
low-level problems not merely difficult,
but impossible.
In what follows I propose to discuss
certain aspects of the low-level crisis and
to point out how the obscure happeniì1gs
in the basement have affected and are
JHte'y to go on affecting the lives of pri-
vate individuals, the policies of statesmen
and the conduct of nations.
"Poverty In the Midst
of Poverty"
t has been fashionable for some time
past to talk about"poverty in the
midst of plenty". The phrase implies
that the planet possesses abundant re-
sources to feed, clothe, house and provide
amenities. for its existing population and
for any immediately foreseeable increase
in that population, and that the present
miseries of the human race are due
entirely to faulty methods of production
and, above all, of distribution. Given
currency reform, socialism, communism,
unrestricted capitalism, distribution, or
whatever the favourite remedy may be,
humanity, like the prince and princess in
the stories, will be able to live happily
ever after. Want and hunger will be
transformed into abundance and the
whole earth will become one vast Land of
Cockayne.
Such are the miracles to be achieved
by political and economic planning. But
when we pass from these high-level
considerations to a study of what is
going on at the biological and ecological
levels, our optimism is apt to seem a
little premature, to say the least of it.
Instead of poverty in the midst of
plenty, we then find that there is poverty
in the midst of poverty. World-resources
are inadequate to world-population. And
meanwhile world population is rising. It
is rising at the rate of about two hundred
millions every ten years.
thirties. But within the next twenty-five
years the population of the United States
will rise (if nothing untoward happens in
the interval) by about thirty millions.
What is happening in North America
is happening also in other parts of the
world. Erosion is rampant all over Africa,
where a rapidly increasing native popu-
lation clings tenaciously to its old habit
of measuring social status in terms of
cattle. There are more people, therefore
more cows, therefore more over-grazing,
therefore more erosion.
In Asia too, the same irreparable
damage is being done to the very
foundations of any possible civilization.
Human poverty exists in the midst of a
steadily increasing natural poverty.
More People-Less Food
Since 1800, Western Europe hasJ trebled its population. This increase
was made possible by the exploita-
tion of the empty and agriculturally
virgin territories of the New World.
commodities are limited and that, in
many places, very rich and easily avai-
lable deposits of those commodities have
been or are in process of being, worked
out.
Thus, in the United States, high-grade
iron ore is running low ; so are zinc,
copper, lead ; so is petroleum. And this
is happening at a time when a rising
population with steadily improving me-
thods of production is calling for ever-
increasing quantities of consumer goods
- in other words, is making ever heavier
demands on the limited reserves of our
planetary capital.
FOOD, PEOPLE
AND POLITICS
N unfavourable relationship bet-
A"ween population and natural
resources cr ates a permanen
menace to peace and a permanent
menace to political and personal liberty
In our days, whether there is a threat
to peace depends upon whether such an
over-populated country possesses an in-
dustrial plant capable of producing
armaments.
There can be no aggression without
the means to aggression. Lacking these
means, the people of an over-populated
country are confronted with two alterna-
tives. They can either stop breeding, and
so reduce the population. Or else they
can go on breeding until famine, disease,
political unrest and civil war combine
to raise the death-rate to the point Where
a decreased population can re-establish
a favourable relationship with natural
resources.
But some over-populated countries are
also industrialized ; and for these there
15 a third alternative : to enslave or exter-
minate their neighbours, and so acquire
more land, food, raw materials and
markets.

leaders of industrialized countries with

Soil-Erosion

Civilization

while popu-
lation goes
up, the fertility of
the soil declines.
Atomic warfare can
destroy one parti-
cular civilization ;
soil-erosion can put
an end to the very
possibility of any
civilization. Favour-
able weather has
prevailed in North
America for the
last eight years
and, in conse-
quence, we hear
much less ofero-
- ion than was heard
during that succes-
sion of dry seasons
which called the
Dust Bowl into
existence.
Nevertheless, in
spite of consider-
abie improvment
in agricultural
practices, soil-ero-
sion still goes on
and is likely, as
soon as the conti-
nental weather ta-
kes another turn
for the worse, to
assume the same
disastrous propor-
tions as it did in the
Today the New World has a large
and rapidly increasing population of its
own and soil, after more than a century
of abuse, is losing its fertility. There
is still a very large exportable surplus
of food ; but as numbers go up, and
fertility goes down, there will be less
and less to spare for the hungry in
other parts of the world. Moreover, the
manufactured articles which Western
Europe exchanged for food and raw
materials have tended to become less
acceptable in proportion as the nations
of the New World have developed their
own industries.
Food is a renewable commodity. If the
soil is not abused, this year's harvest
be succeeded by next year's. But the
vein of tin or copper which produced
this year's output of ore will not be
renewed in years to come. When the lode
has been worked out, the miner must
move on to another deposit of the mi-
neral. And if he can find no other de-
posits-well, that is just too bad.
Industrialism is the systematic exolol-
tation of wasting assets. The thing we call
progress is in many cases simply accele-
ration in the rate of that exploitation.
And such prosperity as we have known
up to the present is the consequence of
rapidly spending the planet's irreplaceable
capital.
How long can the accelerating dissipa-
tion of capital go on ? How soon will the
wasting assets of the world be exhaust-
ed ? All we know for certain is that the
supplies of many hitherto essential
winning any war they care to wage
against the countries with low birth-
rates. And remembering that David
killed Goliath with a stone from his
sling, the military leaders of the coun-
tries with low birth-rates will come to
believe that their only chance of survival
consists in using, before it is too late,
their technical superiority in atomic and
biological weapons, in order to offset the
effect of the big battalions.
So long as it remains axiomatic that
nations exist for the purpose of damaging
or destroying one another, the unequal
increase of world population is no'ess
dangerous, politically speaking, than the
over-all increase of population pressure
on resources...
A Time of Gravest Danger
SSUMING for the sake of argument,
 that, in spite of nationalism and
militarism, a world population
policy should be agreed upon, how easy
would it be to get that policy implement-
ed ? The answer is that, in the countries
where its immediate implementation
would be most desirab1e, it would be
exceedingly difficult, indeed almost im-
possible, to do so... [And] even if a.
substantial cut in the present high birth-
rates of the world were to take place

2. 000. If no such policy is adopted the
crisis is likely, unless something startlingly
good or something startlingìy bad should
happen in the interval, to persist for
many years thereafter...
The problem requires simultaneous
attack on several fronts-the ideological
front, the organizational front and thescientific-technological front. On the
ideological front the formidable enemy
to peace is nationalism ; for it is in the
context of nationalistic thinking that
over-population becomes most dangerous.
The depth and sincerity of religIOus
belief are measured by the sacrifices
which the believer is prepared to make
for it. At the present time there are
probably a thousand men and women
prepared two undergo martyrdom for the
local national idol, to everyone who
would willingly die for his or her belief
in God. Of all the motives for mass
action, nationalism is, at present, by far
the most potent...
A World Food Policy ?
THE supply of food can beincreased in the following ways :
by improving existing methods of
production, conservation and distribu-
tion ; by opening up hitherto unexplored
areas of land and sea ; and by developing
techniques for transforming easily avai-
lable materials into nourishment, either
directly for man or indirectly for his
domesticated animals, insects and fungi.
The international Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations exists
for the purpose of considering, and mak-
ing recommendations about, these ways
of increasing the world's food supply. The
organization possesses no authority, and
one of its ambitious schemes-the Orr
Plan for a World Food Board empowered
to buy and distribute surpluses, to stabilize
prices and preserve an"ever-normal gra-
nary"-has been rejected by a majority
of the governments concerned.
But there are other ways of getting
results : the delegates to the F. A. O. are
extremely competent, and we can cer-
tainly count on them, in the years ahead,
to do as good a job as the various na-
tional governments, to which they are
responsible, will permit...
HEN one looks at a map of the
"'-'i ! J world... shaded according to the
density of population, one see. ;
that large areas are almost uninhabited.
Most are uninhabited because, under
present conditions, they are uninhabit-
able. In some places the expenditure of
more or less considerable quantities of
human labor and capital might change
the conditions and make the land pro-
ductive.
As world population rises and the
demand for food yet further outstrips
Mie supply, it will become increasingly
worth while to spend time, work and
money on tasks which, in present cir-
cumstances, are economically unjustifia-
ble. And if atomic power can be harness-
ed without too much danger, and made
available at a very cheap rate, many
projects at present quite unjustifiable
would become matters of practical policy.

THE WAY OUT ?
By. SirJohn Russell
MR. HUXLEY'S thesis is extreme-
ly ingenious and well argued.
I disagree compl tely with most
of his conclusions, through there are
some with which I fully concur, in par-
titular, the necessity for more food pro-
duction...
The way of mankind has always been
and in all probability will always be
hard... (and) only by strenuous and
well-directed work can our problems
ever be solved ; but I am convinced that
man can conquer his difficulties as they
ar'se...
I must emphasize the impossibility of
setting any limit to the world's resour-
ces Estimates made forty years ago are
in most cases far below those that would
be made now...
Tt is equally impossible to forecast the
world's population over any long period.
Judging from the past, it seems safe to
assume that where standards of living
r : se, birthrates tend to fall and the pro-
portion of older people tends to increase ;
on the other hand, among peasant popu-
lations where children are an economic
asset the birth-rate is high.
I shall deal mainly with world food
resources : these depend on the amount
of land available, the use to which it is
put, and the size of the population that
has to be fed. The world population is
estimated at about 2, 200 millions and
in present rate of increase at about
20 millions per annum. 1 shall assume
that this rate continues...
The total land area of the world is
about 36, 000 million acres, but only a
fraction of this can be cultivated.
The food problem is most ser : ous in
Great Britain, North-West Europe (ex-
cepting Denmark) and India. The pos-
sibility of trouble'was foreseen by
Malthus in 1798, but the fears were
al'ayed by the opening up of North
America... Fears of impending shortage
have been recently revived by Sir John
Orr, first director of the Food and Agri-
culture Organization ; Sir John has
raised a new problem : the need for rec-
tifying the under-nutrition from which
a large part of the world suffers.
More Land to Grow
Food
Expanding
Into the Dry Regions
THE customary methods of farmingbreak down when the annual
rainfall is less than about 18 inches.
The North American pioneers who
pushed westwards beyond. the 18-inch
legion met the difficulty by developing
methods of soil management which con-
served moisture, and by modernizing the
ancient art of irrigation ; these methods
were all empirical but they worked...
The most effective way of overcoming
dry conditions is by irrigation. Two
general methods are adopted : from
canals and from wells.
Canal irrigation is largely concentrated
around the Himalayan rivers flowing
southwards in India, Pakistan and
Burma and eastwards into China. The
greatest of these schemes is the Lloyd
Barrage in Sind, which waters five
milUon acres of crops. the various Punjab
schemes water nearly 18 million acres ;
it is known that the Tigris-Euphrates
system has great possibilities for the
future.
River valley, developments, on the
pattern of the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity, are under way in many parts of
the world. In such projects as Brazil's
San Francisco Valley Authority, French
West Africa's Niger River Authority,
and Mexico's Papaloapan River Commis-
sion, irrigation is but one factor in a
unified system of cower, flood control
and soil rehabilitation.
The other method, irrigation from
wells, also very ancient, has been greatly
improved by the tube wells first de-
veloped in California and much used by
Sir William Stampe in India... (Stampe
has urged that the possibilities in Africa,
Arabia, and the Middle East should be
investigated.)
One of the most serious troubles fol-
lowing on the so-called"conquest of the
drought"has been soil erosion : for long
it was hardly perceptible... By 1935,
however, it had become so serious that
a Soil Conservation Service was set up
in the United States ; similar services
have been established throughout the
British Commonwealth. Methods of pre-
vention and rehabilitation have, now been
devised and are being continuously im-
proved... Soil erosion is no longer the
menace it was-though constant watch
by experts is needed.
Widening The Temperature
Range
CANADA led the way in pushing the
wheat belt further north into the re-
gions where the summer, though hot
enough for the growth of wheat, did
not last long enough to allow of ripen-
ing... The possibilities of the regions.
still further north are being studied by
the United States in Alaska and by the
USSR. While no surplus could ever be
expected, there is the hope of producing
more and better for those who live there.
At the other extreme, cultivation is
teing pushed into the hotter regions in
Queensland... The most ambitious sche-
mes are in Africa.
Science And Wheat
Production
THE beneficent results of applyingscience to agriculture are well seen
in wheat production. This is really
a dry region enterprise...
The United States greatly increased its
production of wheat during the war,
and from being onlv a small exporter,
Ol even an importer, has during the war
years produced an additional 300 million
bushels, much of which was exported.
There seems every justification there-
fore for expecting that the great wheat-
supplying countries can expand their
production considerably if the need
arises...
Maize, Rice. And Millets
O F the other food grains, the threechief are maize, rice and the
millets Maize is very fully studied in
the United States, its chief producer, and
the remarkable results obtained in recent
years with the new hybrids give hopeful
promise for the future.
The millets have not vet been ade-
quately studied. Their tolerance of hot.
dry and poor conditions make them
extremely important as food in the semi-
arid hot regions of India and Africa...
They are almost a virgin field for the
geneticist and plant breeder, but the
pioneering investigations promise noeasy or spectacular successes.
Rice is more important because rice
taters probably outnumber the wheat
eaters. It has been much studied in India
in recent years and already the yields
on the experimental farms are not
uncommonly double those obtained by
the neighbouring peasants.
The Overcrowded
Lands
A. Great Britain
And N. W. Europe
YIELDS per acre and output per
man (in Great Britain) are among
the highest in Europe and are
three or four times greater than in
Eastern Europe and the USSR ; they are
still rising. No British expert believes the
limit is yet reached...
But our cultivated area is still shrink-
ing. and as the population rises, more
imports will become necessary ; not
however beyond the visible possibilities
of the exporting countries to supply. The
inexorable condition is, of course, that
they must be paid for bY harder work.
Without this the standards of life must
inevitably fall.

The countries of North Western Eu-
rope. including Western Germany, art
in a similar position, needing to import
food : they were, however, taken as a.
group, self-sufficient in meat and dairv
produce before the war. There was then
much movement of grain from the
Danubian countries and poland to the
W east that the net Euronean deficit of
wheat and rye amounted only to about
5 per cent of the total consumption... If
the former east-west movement of grain
is restored, Europe's bread supplies will
be secure, but unpredictable political
factors come into play. There is no phys-
icaì reason why North Western Europe
ahould suffer food shortage as long as
there is peace.
B. The Indian Problem
F'ale the food problems of theworld, India's and Pakistan's are
probably the most difficult. The
population has grown rapidly, from
3M millions in 1921 to 338 millions in
1931 and 389 millions in 1941 : increases
of 10 and 15 per cent respectively...
Population increases at the present
rate would, unless yields rose, require an
additional 3 or 4 million acres of food

crops each year. There still remains
uncultivated land equal in area to about
70 % of the cultivates land, some of
wbich can be utilized. But the greatest
hop is by increasing the ryots yields.
More irrigation, more fertilizer, better
cultivation and better seed are all being
developed.
India's rainfall, however, is always
uncertain, and importation of rice is
always necessary. There are abundant po-
tential supplies in Burma. Siam and Indo-
China... It seems impossible, however.
for India's food problems to be solved if
the. population goes on increasing at its
present rate.
C. The Double Task
II NCREASING output per man, andM output per acre, in the old occupied
lands, is really the crux of the
world food problem ; for it is estimated
that some 90 0/0 of the world's food is
consumer in or near the land of its pro-
duction and only about 10 0/0 is put on
to the world market ; further, that about
THE DOUBLE CRISIS
(Continued from preeceding Page)
Meanwhile, it has been reported that
the Russians have succeeded in thawing
out the Siberian tundra and converting
it into fields of eye and wheat. Much
hitl : erto barren land in sub-Arctic Asia
and America might become productive if
this can be done...
To break the politically dangerous
monoplies in fertile territories and in
access to the sea, chemists and biologists
should be enlisted to collaborate own. a
series of Manhattan Projects, not of des-
truction, but of creation. Thus, the Ger-
mans are said to have used a method
for converting organic waste produces,
such as sa. wdust, into a sugar solution
tor the culture of edible yeasts.
Such a technique, if suitably developed,
might provide much-needed proteins for
those millions who, at present, have two
subsist on an unbalanced diet of cereals.
And the goal of another of these projects
would be the synthesis of chlorophyll,
the substance which permits the growing
plant to use the sun's energy to convert
air and water into carbohydrates.
Up to the present the rulers of the
'World have been ready to lavish time.
energy, money and brains upon the de-
velopment of atomic and biological
'Weapons ; it might be a good thing to
use the resources of applied science for
th2 relief of the world's hunger and the
removal of one of the principal causes
of war.
Natural monoplies in raw materials are
even more politically dangerous than
natural monoplies in food. When located
in the territory of a strong nation.
deposits of minerals necessary-to in-
dustry are a standing temptation to
the abuse of military and economic power ;
when located in that of a weak nation,
they are a standing temptation to
aggression from abroad.
Research should be deliberately orga-
nized for the purpose of discovering uni-
versally available substitutes for thes
relatively rare and most unevenly distri-
buted minerals. If successful, such re-
search would have two beneficial results :
it would break the natural monoplies
which are so politically dangerous ; and
it would help our industrial civilization
to shift from its precarious basis in the
exploitation of rapidly wasting1 assets to
a more secure, a more nearly permanent.
foundation.
) M NDUSTRIAL civilization is basedupon the exploitation of wasting
assets by means of man-power and
the power generated by coal, oil, gas and
falling water. If successfully harnessed,
atomic energy will increase the available
power to an enormous extent. From this,
two results may be anticipated, one
unfa, vourable, the other favourable.
70 0/0 of the world's population are food
producers or their direct dependents.
It is this 70 0/0 who determine the
f ? te of the remaining 30. Presumably
they would be the last to feel the pinch
of hunger, should it come. Most of them
are peasants, their chief produce is
grain, and much of their farming is
very inefficient, with no great possibility
of improvement as it stands.
There no longer are peasants in Great
Britain but there were up to the 18th
century, and their systems and output
were on a level with those of the present
t'a\ peasants of Eastern Europe. Great
Britain then changed its system... Denmark
ef`ected the change later ; the farms had
to be smaller, but a system of co-opera-
tion has been developed which has led
to high efficiency of production and a
standard of living that is the envy of
most of Europe and far above anything
in Eastern Europe and beyond.
The fundamental difference between
the peasant and the Western farmer is
that the peasant is a self-sufficing unit,
producing mainly for himself and his
f&mily, selling only his surpluses, while
the Western farmer is producing for the
market...
One farm worker in Eastern Europe
ard the USSR produces food equivalent
to the needs of some four or five persons.
including himself, but in Great Britain
and Denmark the production per man
is about four times as high, one man
feeding perhaps 10 or 20 persons, who
th".. s become available for other occupa-
tions.
D. New Methods of Farming
N entirely different system, collec-
A, tire farming, has been adopted in
Soviet Russia. This requires large
éfeaf< of land... ; it is perhaps better
suited for grain production than for
livestock.
To begin with
we may expect
that increased
power will lead to
the more effective
exploitation and
consequently to
the more rapid
exhaustion of the
more easily avai-
lable supplies of
such indispensa-
ble minerals as
iron, tin, copper,
zinc and the like.
Atomic energy
will permit us to
enjoy the prospe-
rity of the spend-
thrift who lives
gloriously for &
few years on in-
herited capital. If
this were all that
could be expect-
ed, the discovery
of atomic energy
would be wholly
disastrous. But
fortunately this
is not the whole
story.
Given an inde-
fimte amount of
cheap power, jt
will become eco-
nomically possi-
ble to exploit de-
posits whose low
concentration of
desirable minerals
render them, un-
der present con-
ditions. practical-
ly worthless.

Peasant farming can undoubtedly be
transformed into more highlv productive
system capable of producing more food
of higher nutritive value and of raising
output both per man and per acre.
Meanwhile, the steady advance of
sciences and the practice of agriculture
in the more advanced countries can be
applied elsewhere when conditions per-

better seeds, better control of disease,

output in Great Britain... The average

the good farmer expects 1, 000 or more.
There are still possibilities of improve-
ment even in the most advanced
countries. Losses due to insect pests and
diseases are still high ; the current esti-
mate (which is little more than a guess)
put : them at 10 per cent in Great Bri-
tain, while livestock diseases are estimat-
ed to lose us about 6 million full year's
rations of meat, 200 million gallons of
milk and 1, 500 million eggs.
The Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion has estimated that mites, pests and
rodents destroy some 65 million tons of
the world's grain per annum-more than
the entire wheat and rye supply for all
Europe before the war...
E. Prospects for the Future
or who sets of problems are involvedin world supplies : the rehabilita-
tion of European agriculture, and
the expansion of our present agriculture
to supply a world population increasing
at its present rate.
The first of these should fairly soon
be accomplished ; first grain supplies.
then, more slowly, dairy produce and
meat should come back to pre-war level...
The permanent expansion of food pro-
duction can be achieved by increasing
the area under cultivation, by increasing
cutput per acre, and by seducing waste
? rd tosses.
Only about 5 to 10 per cent of the
world's land area is yet used for food
production to any extent and there
remain considerable regions in the tropics
that can be utilized with the help of
syrthetic insecticides and modern im-
plements. In all countries there still
remain areas that could be cultivated.
The average output per acre is every-
where considerably less than is obtained
bý the best of the farmers, and much
levelling up is possible by education and
cc-operation ; agricultural science and
engineering are continuously advancing
M) d even in the most advanced countr : es
yields are increasing. The causes of the
wastes and losses are gradually being
better understood and brought under
can trol. As. the need arises, expansion
of food production can continue and it
is impossible to forecast how far it can
go...
F. The Hard Way
HE change that would most increasefood production would be to trans-
form the present predominantly
peasant type of rural economy to a
mixed farm type as adopted in the more
& ("1\ anced countries.
While increases in food production can
be confidently expected, they will cer-
tainly involve considerable work and
much scientific study. There is no pros-
pect of easy living :' the lot of mankind
will always be hard. Each nation must
either produce its own food or produce
goods and services that will induce other
coup. tries to produce it for them.
E is impossible to estimate the rate
of agricultural progress and therefore
impossible to suggest a safe rate of
increase of human population. At pre-
sent rates there is no need to fear'
shortage in our time, except in India.
and parts of Africa. The possibilities of
srirntific advancement are incalcuhble.
What is needed is to put these advances.
into practice, and to treat the problems
; nternationally. The kev to the problem
of FOOD AND PEOPLE is international

Population Problems
of India and Pakistan
by Dr. Sriþati Chandrasekhar
II NDIA'S population problem arises
primarily out of an extremely high
fertility ccompanied by high
mortality which is only slowly declining
The resulting increase, which amounted
to more than four million a year in an
undivided India, need. not constitute a
problem if the Indian level of living were
high enough to absorb the additional
population without reducing the level of
living, and if a majority of the population
enjoyed the jcreducible minimum require-
ments of decent human existence in
terms of food, health, clothing, shelter,
employment and leisure for recreation.
But India's level of living. is so low that
any further addition to the number of
poor families may well be disastrous.
Growth of Population
HE population of the combined do-minions of India and Pakistan
today is nearly 450 millions or about
one f1fth of the total world population.
The rate of increase of the Indian popu-
lation, though high, has not been ab-
normal. The problem in India is not
however the rate of increase but the
net addition to the existing population
every decade.
Because of the large number of India's
existing population, even a modest rate
of increase of 10 or 15 per cent yields a
net gain of some 50 millions, in itself
larger than the population of any Euro-
pean country except Germany or Russia,
or any Latin American country. And it
'is this large net addition that constitutes
the problem because it nullifies all efforts
to improve the admittedly very low
standard of living. of the Indian people.
All efforts to increase the production of
food, other commodities and services to
give a better per capita share to the
existing population are largely frustrated
by this increasing addition to the popu-
lation.
Fertility
MONG all demographic factors, the
A rate of fertility is the most im-
portant, for international lack of
balance in fertility constitutes the crux
of the world population problem.
The significant fact about the Indian
birth rate is not that it is one of the
highest in the world but that it has shown
no signs of decline during the last fifty
years. In Western and industrialized
countries, the decline in fertility began
in urban areas, and the rural areas tended
to follow the downward trend after a
time lag. This has been so because in-
dustrialization has been accompanied by
the widespread adoption of the planned
family habit.
Though India may conform to this
experience eventually, it has not been the
case till now. The lower fertility in Indian
urban areas must be explained in terms
of adverse sex ratio where the relative
paucity of females and the absence of
wives constitute a remarkable feature,
which will be discussed later.
Mortality
tj) NDIA'S population growth during thelast century has been conditioned
mainly by the high but fluctuating
death rate. Famines, epidemics, the gene-
ral unsanitary environment and wars
have contributed to the death rate. During
"normal"years the death rate has been
consistently high because of the striking
lack of public sanitation and hygiene,
and widespread mal-and under-nutri-
tion of the population. It can be said with
some truth that famine and epidemics
alone have controlled the growth of
India's population during the last hun-
dred years.
The Indian death rate is high-30 per
thousand. The recorded death rate for
1931 was 24 per thousand and 22 for 1940,
but these are under-estimates because of
incomplete returns. This means that
more than 10 million people die every
year in India.
The most disquieting factor of the
Indian death rate is the high incidence of
mortality among first year infants,
women in child-birth and women of the
reproductive age group. Nearly one-fourth
of the babies born die during their first
year. About half the deaths among infants
occur in the first month and. of these,
nearly sixty per cent in the first week.
Mortality remains high throughout early
childhood. About forty-nine per cent of
the total mortality in any given year is
among those below ten years of age,
while the corresponding figure for. Eng-
land is only twelve per cent.
As for maternal mortality, at least
200, 000 women die every year during
child-birth or 100 out of every thousand !
Health Conditions
THUGS, out of every hundred born, onequarter die by the time they reach
their first birthday. When the fifth
birthday arrives, forty per cent have
disappeared through death, and when the
twentieth birthday is at hand only fifty
per cent are left. By the sixtieth birthday
only fiftcen per cent survive.
But despite the pres-
ent mortality rates, the
average annual addition
to the population of
both the Dominions was
five million. During the
last two decades there
has been, however, a
steady fall in the gen-
eral mortality-rate. A
further fall is bound to
occur if the large-scale
programmes for improv-
ing the health of the
country by various
planning committees are
effectively put into
operation.
It has been calculated
that even a slight im-
provement in the pres-
ent health conditions
can save three million
infant lives. When this
is done, India's popula-
tion will increase by
not five but eight
million a year. And it
is possible that the 83
million increase that
took place between 1921
and 1941 may take place
between 1941 and 1951.
A planned and purpose-
ful control of mortality
without a corresponding
control of the birth rate
can only have dis9S-
trous consequences for
India.
Today, however, the death rate is the
decisive factor in Indian demography.
No comment is necessary on this inordi-
nate and tragic loss of human lives. Nor
is this all. There are many who do not
die but who cannot be counted among the
truly living, healthy, active and gainfully
employed because of the shocking nature
of Indian morbidity.
Social Factors
iE demographic situation of anytm-J region is largely he product of
its peculiar social characteristics
affecting in their turn births, deaths and
migration. The population problem in
India can conceivably be very different
if the social institutions of early marriage.
universality of marriage, the ban on
widow re-marriage and the joint Hindu
family and other institutions and atti-
tudes resulting in an adverse sex ratio,
among others, did not exist.
But as these institutions, with a socio-
religious tradition and sanction berund
them, exist and condition the lives of an
overwhelming majority of the people, the
demographic problem has become what it
is today.
ARLY marriage and universality ofL marriage are dominant features 
the Indian social scene. While child
marriage as such has largely disappeared,
a majority of girls between 15 and 20 are
married. The girls in rural areas marry
as soon as they reach puberty, and begin
bearing children early.
lrHE second factor is the universalityof the married state. Every-one in
India, sooner or later, gets married.
It is a quasi-religious duty. For a repre-
sentative census year like 1931, we find
that 467 males and 492 females out of
every thousand were married. This means,
that taking into consideration all widows,
some widowers, ascetics and mendicants,
almost everyone of marriageable age was
actually married.
Scarcity of Females
A THIRD striking characteristic of
the Indian social situation is the
scarcity of females. There has
been a deficiency of women in the Indian
population within the knowledge of the
country's regular census

widows, for the old husband passes away,
leaving behind his young wife a widow.
And, of course, she cannot remarry.
The disproportionate sex ratio and the
resulting deficiency of women keeps up the
custom of early marriage for girls. As
bachelors and widowers have to take brides
of any age they can get, the disparity
between partners is increased. This differ-
ence in age increases widowhood. Since
widows cannot remarry, widowhood in-
creases the already existing shortage of
eligible brides, which means of course the
paucity of women. Thus the vicious wheel
whirls on.
The two significant facts about the
wasteful balance between births and.
deaths in India are the large decennial
increases in the population and the tre-
mendous human cost at which this in-

The problem of population has to be
considered in relation to the means of
sustenance. mainly food supply. Nearly 70
per cent of the population is dependent on
agriculture for a livelihood. As the mouths
to be fed every year increase, the area of
productive land diminishes.

In other words, the harnessing of atomic
power is likely to accelerate the dissipa-
tion of what may be called our high-
grade capital. but it should postpone the
final onset of bankruptcy by making
available to industry the low-grade capital
which it now costs US too much to spend...
Applied science can... be used in the
fight for liberty no less effectively than in
the fight for peace. Let us assume, for
example, that a means will be discovered
for substantially increasing the supply of
food. This would have the same kind of
result as the discovery of a second New
World. It would make life easier. for the
inhabitants of over-crov.'ded countries
and. by doing so, Jt would remove the ne-
cessity for some of the centralized and
peremptory social controls which must
always be imposed when the pressure of
population upon resources becomes ex-
cessive.
Meanwhile, every day brings its quota
of some fifty-five thousand new human
beings to a planet which, in the same
period of time, has lost through erosion
almost the same number of acres of pro-
ductive land and goodness knows how
many tons of irreplaceable minerals.
Whatever may be happening to the su-
perficial crisis, to the crisis on the poll.
tical, or industrial or financial levels,
that which underlies it persists and
deepens.
The current almost explosive growtlì
in world population began about two
centuries ago and will continue, in an
probability, for at least another hundred
years. So far as we know. nothing quite
like it has ever happened before. We are
faced by a problem that has no earlier
precedent. To discover and, having dis-
covered, to apply the remedial measures
is going to be exceedingly difficult. And
the longer we delay, the greater the
difficulty will be.
History.
Several explanations
have been offered for
this phenomenon of
deficiency of females.
Some explain it as the
result of relative under-
enumeration of women.
Some argue that the
excessive masculinity is
an. index of"racial"
decadence.
Some others have offer-
ed a biogolical explana-
tion :"The Indian caste
system with its exoga-
mous gotra (sept) and
endogamous caste is a
wrfect method of pre-
serving what is called
in genetics"pure line..."
This explanation is at
best plausible but we
have very little know-
ledge about the presence
of a genetic factor, if
any. in the Hindu caste
system. While there may
be some truth in this
explanation in the sense
Lhat excessive inbreeding
is generally harmful, it
does not, explain the sex
ratio at birth.
The available statistics
tell a different story.
Actually, between the
ages of 1-5,-India has an
excess of girls and only
at the next age group the sex ratio is re-
versed in favour of males. A more rational
explanation for the paucity of females is
that... Hindu parents put greater premium
on male children and are apt to treat
female children with relative r. eglect, es-
pecially when they are assailed by infantile
ailments. This, coupled with early marriage
and a high birth rate, results in greater
and early death among women.
Ban on Widow
Re-marriage
THE social ban on widow re-marriageis yet another reactionary feature of
Indian demography. The Indian de-
mographic situation is closely interwoven
with social problems. Since most widowers
remarry and since they cannot marry
widows, they have to seek wives among
girls much their juniors. This unequal
combination from the point of view of age
itself leads to an increasing number of

Early in February of thi$ year, at the request of the Slame$e
Government, Unesco sent a consultative educational mission to
undertake a br :'ef study of Ute educational system of tlte
country.
The mission has now completed its work and Sir John Sar-
gent, former educational adviser to the Indian Government, wlW
headed the mission, and Dr. Pedro T. Orata, who has worked
with American Ind ; ans in South Dakota and whelped organize
Unesco's educational mission to the Philippines, are now
preparing a full report on their findingll. This report will shorty
be submitted to the Siamese Government.
For the benefit of Courier readers, Dr. Orata reports, in tM
following article, on the Mission to Siam :
Jr lAM (or Thailand), which isshaped like a kite with a
coastline stretching over
1, 300 miles, is a country with one
of the lowest population densities
in Asia and the Far East-30 per
square kilometre."
Although 90 0/0 of its people are
engaged in farming, only 10 0/0
of its arable land is being ex-
ploited. Recently the Government
embarked on an ambitious pro-
gramme of industrialization and
hopes to introduce mechanized
farming into parts of the coun-
try in the near future. Large
factories are being planned and
existing industries are being
modernized.
Economic and technical de-
velopment on a large scale,
therefore, is one of the big goals
of modern-day Siam. Indeed, ac-
cording to certain authorities, it

Among the questions to be
studied at the Unesco conference
in Denmark are the extent to
which traditional adult education
methods can be improved by the
use of new materials and techm-
ques such as film, radio and the
press, records, posters and graphs,
discussion groups, the dramatiza-
tion of current events, and the
study of foreign languages.

activities range from evening
courses to music and dramatic
performances and include do-
mestic and technical training,
while at the same time embracing
arts and crafts and folk dancing
hobbies.
The extent of the movement in
some parts of the world, for
example in Great
Britain, theUnit-
ed States and
the Scandinavian
countries, is out
of all proportion
to the slow pro-
gress made in
others. Moreover,
these more ad-
vanced countries
were cut off from
one another by
the war, and
some of their
methods now fail
to meet the ra-
idly changing
needs of life.
So there is a
great need four

tacts to be re-

and paid teachers, an inadequate
education budget, indifference of
adults to available educational
opportunities, and irregular child
and youth attendance in schools.
Most Siamese teachers them-
selves have not completed their
high-school education. The six-
day school week offers little time
for recreational or other activities ;
over-emphasis is given to"book
work"and examinations ; and the
curriculum is apparently geared
along college preparatory lines
- this in spite of the fact that
only one eut of 2, 000 pupils who
enter the first grade ever reaches
college.'
This may explain why, af Siam's
4. 000. 000 children of compulsory
school age, over 1, 250, 000 or 33 0/0
do not attend classes. Of the re-
maining two and a half million,
less than one third reach the
fourth grade.
As a result of its observations
and the exchange of views with
education officials, teachers, stud
ents and local authorities, the
Mission felt'9 that a number
 of suggestions
appeared to be
pertinent for
Siam at the present time.
First, the school curriculum
should be improved in the light
of modern living requirements-
and to this end an educational
commission should be formed to
undertake a complete study, in
liaison with Unesco, of the entire
educational system of Siam. The
Government has agreed that the
commission will be formed this
year.
Schooling For
Citizenship
Second, at least seven years of
schooling should be made com-
pulsory to insure permanent li-
teracy and adequate citizenship
training.
Third, teacher training facili-
ties should be extended, salaries
increased and educational re-
quirements raised to two years of
college study for elementary
school teachers, and the equiva1en,
of the bachelor's degree for se-
condary school teachers
Fourth, sufficient decentraliza-
tion of the education system
should be permitted to enable
teach-ers to adapt programmes to
local needs and stimulate local
initiative.
In planning new school curri-
cula, the determining factor
should be the extent to which they
are related to the problems of
present living in the different
regions of the country. A curri-
culum that fits one country and
people well does not necessarily
fit another ; similarly, enough va-
riation should exist to allow
for regional differences in curri-
culum content and in the choice
of vocational subjects.
Thus in Central Siam, where
fishing and farming predominate,
these subjects should be em-
phasized and the pupils started in
their work toward participating
in the intelligent pursuance of
these occupations.
The Siamese Government have
show n full appreciation of
Unesco's efforts to help re-
construct their educational sys-
tem, and are extremely eager for
continued assistance so that the
suggestions made may be carried
out as speedily and as effectively
as possible.
"People's College"was established
in 1921. in a small manor house
at Elsinore which was adapted
as a college. Its first students-
clerks, university men, farmers
and city workers from seven
countries-helped to put the
buildings and garden into shape
as they began their studies.-
Since then, over 4. 600 students.
representing over 40 countries.
have attended its regular summer
and winter courses, and over 8. 000
its vacation courses.
The example of this interna-
tional co-operation in education
will probably not be lost to the
delegates to the Unesco confer-
ence, who will be living and
working in the same rooms and
lecture halls previously occupied
by thousands of students of allnationalities
current plans materialize it is
possible that within the foresee-
able future there may arise in
Siam an industrial centre that
will hold its own with modern
Japan.
Illiteracy Problem
H OWEVER, in a country likesiam, where 70 0/0 of th
inhabitants are illiterate,
lack : of education constitutes a
formidable im-
pediment to
technical deve-
lopment. As Dr.
Torres Bodet re-
cently declared :'me first essen-
tial for any technological and
economic progTess is to raise the
standard of education of the gen-
eral population."
Fully aware of this need, the
Government of Siam has been
making a strong effort in recent
years to improve and extend its
educational system.
In 1948, Siam asked Unesco's co-
operation in a campaign against
illiteracy which the Government
had undertaken. For this work,
the services were secured of a
well-known literary expert from
the United States, Dr. Frank Lau-
bach.
In February of this year a
Unesco Consultative Educational
Mission, composed of Sir John
Sargent of the British Council
and the present writer, arrived in
Bangkok to study and offer sug-
gestions on some of the educa-
tional problems of Siam. While
the Mission was at work. Dr. Lau-
bach was conducting his literacy
campaign in the province of
Nakon Rajsima, some two hun-
dred miles north-east of Bangkok.
The Mission conferred with
Government education leaders in
a preliminary examination of the
country's schooling problems and
then left the capital for a study
of rural schools of all types. It
compared educational resources
and opportunities in vocational
and technical schools, in elemen-
tary schools and in teacher train-
ing and adult education centres.
The Mission also
visited rural com-
munities noted
for outstanding
h industry
projects such as
silk weaving and
pottery-making, in
order to deter-
mine how these
could be adapted
to fundamental
and general edu-
cation.
Siam is con-
fro n t e d with
many of the edu-
cation problems
which face other
countries of the
world today : ina-
adequately trained
established and for others to be
developed, so that each nation
can become acquainted with t11
achievements-and shortcomings
- of adult education experiments
attempted by others.
lr HIS is why Unesco, as partof its adult education pro-
gramme, is seeking to
bridge the ten-year gap caused
by the war, by calling on adult
education workers and leaders
from every country in the world
- whether a member of Unesco
or not-to meet and exchange
their experiences and ideas. L'1
this way, it hopes to rye-establish
international contacts amonK
adult education workers and to
find out what new forms this
branch of education might take
to meet the demands of both
NEXT June 16th, approxi-mately 150 educational
workers from many na-
tions will gather in the
Great Knight's Hall of the ancient
"Hamlet's Castle"of Krongsoorg
at Elsinore, Denmark, for the
opening of the first international
post-war conference on adult edu-
cation.
From places as far apart as
Norway and Australia, Iceland
and New Zealand they will meet
for ten days to talk over their
problems and to lay the founda-
tions of a permanent internation-
al adult education movement,
one of whose aims will be to
develop a better understanding
between peoples.
For the scope and significance
of adult education has changed
considerably since it began to
be developed towards the end of
the 19th century.
In North America, Great Bri-
tain and the Scandinavian count-
ries, where the movement made
the greatest initial progress, it
usually meant"the three R's"for
grown-ups or apprenticeship train-
ing for a trade.
THERE are still many coun-tries where the term"adult
education"is used to de-
scribe the fight against illiteracy.
But. for practical purposes, the
teaching of literacy is now ge-
nerally considered as a special
field and Unesco, for example, has
given it the name of"fundamen-
tal"education.
In the countries which have
largely solved their illiteracy
problems, adult education, in it. q
broadest sense, means helping
individuals to be equal to the
responsibilities which the growth
Of democracy has brought to
ordinary men and women. In
other words, adult education
today seeks to develop a spirit
of understanding and appreciation
Of other people's cultures and
customs, by improving the mdi-
vidual's general education and

questions.

ing to the country where't

History of Science

Health Experts Set Up
World Medical Council 
O NE of the earliest official
documents published byUnesco says that an In-
ternational Institute of the His-
tory of Science might have the
aim not only of establishing
clearly the manner in which all
the peoples of the earth have
contributed to the progress of our
knowledge of nature, but also of
examining the interactions be-
tween different past cultures.
One group of specialists could.
con-centcate on Chinese-European
relations, another on Arab-Euro-
pean relations... Not a few schol-
ars are available, but their work
is crippled for lack of facilities.
No subject deserves help more.
(1).
In a world increasingly depen-
dent upon science and conscious
of this modern trend, the impof-
iance assigned to the history of
science and scientific thought,
especially in the university and
secondary school education of
many countries, is taking on
added significance. Scientific as-
sociations such as the Swedish
Society for the History of Science
and the Chinese Society for the
History of Medicine have been
formed.
To encourage this rather newsubject of the history of
science and scientific
thought, which might be regarded
as the instrument of the scientific
humanism of tomorrow, Unesco
sponsored the establishment of
an International Union for the
History of Science. It was offi-
cially created at the Fifth Inter-

Human Right Essays
To Appear this Month
Before the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights was
approved by the United Nations
General Assembly last December,
Unesco had already consulted
eminent philosophers, jurists,
writers and educators in many
countries on the philosophical
foundations that could be given to
such a declaration.
Their replies have been used to
compile a Volume of Essays on
the philosophical principles of
human rights which will be pn-
blished in French this month.
national Congress of the History
of Science in October 1947.
The purpose of this Union,
which is the tenth of the inter-
national scientific unions affiliat-
ed with the International Coun-
cil of Scientific Unions, is to
contribute directly to the work of
Unesco and of the Intesnational
Council in the field of the his-
tory of science.
Today the Union comprises five
scientific commissions. The Com-
mission on the History of the
Social Relations of Science is
under the chairmanship of M.
Léon Rcsenfeld, of the University
of Manchester. The Commission
on the Teaching of the History
of Science is engaged in the
publication of a survey of the
teaching of the history of science
throughout the world. The three
other commissions of the Union
deal with Bibliography. Publica-
tions and the Middle East.
Jr INCE its creation, seventeennational History of Science
groups, with a total of
several thousand members, have
become part of the Union and
other national groups are about
to be constituted. The Internatio-
nal Society of the History ofM dicine has afso become
a member. In 1950 the
Union, with the help of
Unesco, will organize the
Sixth International Con-
gress of the History of
Science and also the first
International Congress
on the History of Medi-
cine to meet since 1938.
In addition, at the sugges-
tion of Unesco, History
committees, sections or
commissions have been or
are being set up in several
of the nine international
Union of the History of
Science.
The Unions's public-
tions include two volumes
subsidized by Unesco
which have appeared in
the Collection de Travaux
de l'Académie Internationale
d'Histoire des Sciences. Other
volumes are : n the press, among
them an edition of Lavoisier's
correspondence.
PARTICULAR reference,however, should be made
to the Archives Interna-
tionales d'Histoire des Sciences
(Hermann. & Cie, publishers, 6,
rue de la Sorbonne. Paris, 5.),
published with the help of a grant
from Unesco. Six numbers of this
quarterly have so far appeared ;
the latest issues contain nearly
300 pages, and the contributors to
the review include such disting-
uished scientists as M. Louis de I
Broglie, as well as most of the I
historians of science all over the
world.
The Archives, which publishes
articles in French, English,
Spanish, Italian or German, is
probably the first truly inter-
national review on the history of
science and, in the spirit of
Unesco, attempts to show the
contribution of all cultures and
all ages to the development of
science and the solidarity of the
nations in their attitude towards
scientific progress. The valuable
assistance in the editing of the
review given by the members of
Unesco's four Field Science Co-
operation Offices at Cairo, New
Delhi, Shanghai and Montevideo
should be mentioned. In the
April 1949 issue, first place is
given to a lecture by Dr. Joseph
Needham, F. R. S., to the Third
Session of the General Conference
of Unesco at Beirut, entitled :
"Asia's Contribution to the Unity
of Science."
"IF F there is one field in
M which humanity should
affirm its solidarity, it
is surely in the campaign against
disease", Dr. Jaime TO : Tes Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco, de-
c1ared on Februa-
ry 21, 1949 at the
inauguration of
the Belgian Na-
tional Commis-
sion for Unesco
in Brussels.
Two monthslater, in the same
city, an important
step was taken
towards the ac-
complishment of
the aim defined
by the Director-
General through
the creation of
a Council which,
for the first time
in history, will
co-ordinate the
work of medical
science congresses
on a world-wide
basis.
The establish-
ment of the
Council came at
a result of the
discussions of an
international con-
ference, jointly
sponsored by
Unesco and the
World Health Or-
ganization, which
held its one week
session in the Pa-
iaisdes Academies
of Brussels and
which was attend-
ed by representa-
tives of more than
40 medical non-
governmental or-
ganizations, with
membership cov-
ering conti-
nents and practically all countries
of the world.
"Why do we need another Orga-
nization ?""How will the work of
the Cou7cil contribute to the
betterment of health ?""How does
its aim fit in with the general
purposes of Unesco and of WHO ?"
These and similar questions were
raised several times during the
conference in Brussels.
DESPITE the rather complicatedand academic sounding title
of the new Organization, the
answers to those questions are
relatively simple.
In order to fight the age-old
scourges which have brought and

Entrance to"palais des Academies"
are still bringing untold miseries
to mankind, the mobilization of
all resources created by modern
science and medicine is a condition
sine qua non. Such mobilization
could take place only if a free
and constant exchange of medical
and scientific know-how is ensured
between scholars and physicians
of all countries.
One of the best media of such
an-exchange of ideas and of
kzowledge is the institution of
medical congresses. To promote
the work of those gatherings is
therefore to perfect the very
weapons with which we can defeat
tuberculosis, venereal diseases,
malaria, cancer, to name only a
few of the most terrible enemies
of man.
IN the present complex state of"-scientific d v lopment, the
classical system of holding medical
congresses appears obsolete. For

Dr. Walter H. C. Laves, Unesco's Deputy Director General,
welcomes delegates to the recent medical conference.
one thing, it calls for too much
specialization ; for another, it
involves often unnecessary loss of
time and money for those who
wish to attend the congresses.
. To give only one example, if
an important congress on rheu-
matism is being held in Paris.
such a gathering would be of
interest not only to the specialists
in that discipline but also to those
devoting their work, to pediatric
surgery, etc. But scholars, working
in those related branches, are
often unable to go to the congress
on meumatism because they have
their own meetings at the same
time, or at places too far removed
from the site of the congress.
And then again it happens all
too often that doctors would have
to take a long road from their
country to attend one week of
conference aid that therefore
they decide in advance against
coming just for one single session.
Thus by suggesting appropriate
dates and places for medical
science congresses. the Council
established in Brussels will see
to it that exaggerated specializa-
tion in these meetings is avoided
and that maximum opportunity is
given to scientists of all countries
to attend meetings of interest to
them at the minimum cost with
the minimum loss of time.
BUT the Council wi11 do morethan just co-ordinate. It will
also help congresses to ensure a
high level of work in lending them
the necessary services in the
fields of transition, interpreta-
tion, publication of proceedings,
etc.
This may seem unimportant to
the man in the street, but all
those who have followed a number
of international conferences closely
know only too. well how much of
their success depends on the
efficient working of services such
as ones cited above.
This brings us to another major
aim of the Council, related to
the general question of techniques
of conferences. The holding of
conferences is indeed a eomplieat-
ed business today. The last few
years have wltnessed the emerg-
ing of many new techniques, still
unknown to the world at large.
Again, to use only one example,
the Mental Health Congresses
which took place
last year in Lon-
don applied a
procedure which
might be usefully
followed by other
onferences in the
future, Forever a,
year two hundred
working groups
studied in various
countries the pro-
blems with which
the congresses
were going to deal
and brought their

body.
IF I mentionthat the Coun-
cil also intends to

scientists wishing
to attend con-
gresses, and that

ties raised by
travel, transfer of
funds, etc., the
reader w i I 1-I
think-h a v e a
pretty good idea
of the triple
functions of co-
ordination, info
motion, and direct aid through
which the Council just created
under the sponsorship of Unesco
and WHO will advance progress
in the medical sciences-an us-
sential factor to promote the
physical and mental well-being
of Man.
It is this very same purpose
which explains why the two U. N.
Specialized Agencies encouraged
the idea of a co-ordinating
Council, why they actively sup-
ported the non-governmental orga.-
nizations in its creation, and why,
they are determined to contribute
to the success of the young insti-
tution.
UNESCO, which is here to fosterinternational understanding
in the field of sciences, is indeed
directly interested in organizations
which, like the Council, will make
for closer co-operation between
scientists from wherever they may
come and to whatever political,
economic or social system they
may belong.
As to the WHO, it welcomes of
course every effort aiming at the
use for medical resources for the
creation of a healthier and there-
fore happier wor1d.
Contacts between physiciana
such as those which took place
in Brussels in. the first week ot
April and the many others to be
established thanks to the co-
ordinating Council, are by no
means of a spectacular nature.
They seldom make the headlineS
and are hardly to be found in the
papers. They are however at the
foundation of the international
society which we must build.
It is in this sense that the
Belgian Minister for Health could
affirm at the inaugural meeting
of the Brussels conference that
the Council will contribute to
making the words of Pasteur a
reality when the great scientist
proclaimed"I hold the unconque-
rable belief that Science and
Peace will triumph over ignorance
and war, that nations will come
together not to destroy but to
construct."

E first Unesco-sponsored art portfolio of highM quality colour reproductions, devoted to the
Florentine Master Masaccio, has just been
produced by the Italian publisher Amilcare Pizzi,
of Milan.
This portfolio, which is only the first of a whole
series including various great artists and periods
in the history of world art, will be placed on sale
to the general public within the next few weeks.
Published in three editions with English, French
and Italian texts, the Unesco-sponsored publica-
tion offers 23 reproductions in full colour of
Masaccio's frescos in the Brancacci Chapel of the
Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, located in
Florence. This is the first time that these maser-
pieces of 15th century fresco painting have ever
been rfn>'""eri so completely and so faithfullY.
The Brancacci frescos a. re undoubtedly the most
important achievement of Masaccio, who died br-
fore his 28th birthday. No more than a dozen iso-
lated examples of his work exist outside Italy, so
the Pizzi-Unesco portfolio will undoubtedly take on
unusual significance for students and art lovers in
all countries of the world.
The 28 plates include reproductions from the
frescos"Expulsion from Paradise","The Tribute
NIoney","Peter and John healing the sick","Pc tel'
Bapti, ; ing" and"Raising the King's Son."All the
prints are removeaMe and can easily be framed
or used by groups of students.
Other portfolios dealing with the great Masters
of Italian art are scheduled for publication at
regular intervals. It is planned that all the im-
portant phases of Italian art from the 13th cent :. try
on will be covered in this unique series. To appeal
shortly are portfolios devoted to the Sistine Chapel
and the 15th century frescos in the Vatican.
Working in collaboration with Unesco, other
publishers will produce similar portfo : ios on th"
