The plurality of enlightened opinions 
is a prerequisite of the democratic 
development of our societies. The quality 
of the information disseminated by the 
media – traditional or new – is decisive 
when it comes to shaping public opinion. 
This is why UNESCO puts special emphasis 
on education about media and information, 
which it considers a fundamental skill for 
citizens in the twenty-first century.
Freedom of expression and the free 
movement of ideas by words and images 
are among the constitutive principles 
of UNESCO and at the core of the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
UNESCO supports the work of dedicated 
journalists and activists who defend 
fundamental freedoms, like the journalist 
Dawit Isaak, winner of the 2017 UNESCO/
Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize, 
whose story appears in this issue 
of the UNESCO Courier. 
Over the last decade, more than 800 
journalists have been victims of crimes 
aimed at muzzling freedom of expression. 
Only one murder out of ten ended with a 
conviction. This impunity is unacceptable 
and further fuels the spiral of violence in the 
future. This is why UNESCO is committed to 
putting an end to these crimes against the 
press, on all continents, as an indispensable 
condition for peaceful societies that are all 
the more robust for being better informed. 
In this “post-truth” era, the role of UNESCO 
is more important than ever, and this issue 
of the Courier is a wonderful opportunity 
to renew our founding commitment to 
support information and communication 
to build peace in the minds of men 
and women.

Each time a new media appears, it triggers 
a revolution – print, radio, television, 
the internet, have all changed the face of 
societies, the ways we get information, 
how we live and organize ourselves. 
Each time a new media appears, voices 
rise to assert that it will kill off the one that 
preceded it – that radio will kill off print 
media, that television will kill off radio, that 
digital media will kill off all the others. Yet, 
today’s media landscape also highlights 
examples of complementarity, of emulation 
and interaction between the various means 
of communication and information, where 
they amplify and respond to one another. 
Never before have we communicated so 
much, and never on such a large scale. 
The new technologies have opened up 
new pathways, enabling citizens across the 
world to gain access to more diverse and 
more numerous sources of information, and 
to play a new role in the production of this 
information − to become the producers of 
content themselves. These new media are 
also creating new barriers and raising new 
challenges in terms of regulation and ethics. 
Where does information come from? How 
is it created? Who guarantees its quality? 
How do we distinguish between true 
and false in this web, woven by billions 
of pieces of information coming from 
all sides? In the incredible tangle of the 
media, the traditional roles of producer, 
broadcaster and consumer have changed. 
The production of fake news and the risk 
of confining audiences in “filter bubbles” 
generated by algorithms, raises new 
questions about freedom of expression 
and cultural diversity.

The UNESCO Courier • July-September 2017   |   7 
Today, most of us get our news through 
mobile telephones and from online 
platforms that have grown rich by 
exploiting people’s personal data, while 
at the same time, draining lucrative 
advertising from traditional media. 
Resonating with 
journalists worldwide 
Thousands of news outlets, mainly 
newspapers, have closed. Tens of 
thousands of journalists have lost their 
jobs. People’s access to reliable and 
trusted sources of news has narrowed as 
traditional news sources – particularly 
at the local and regional level – have 
contracted, even though the space for 
free speech has expanded dramatically.
The Ethical Journalism Network (EJN) 
was created five years ago, to strengthen 
journalism in the face of this crisis. 
As a coalition of more than sixty 
groups of journalists, editors, press 
owners and media support groups, EJN 
promotes training and practical actions 
to strengthen ethics and governance. 
Its work − whether it is developing a test 
for journalists to expose hate speech, 
guidelines on reporting conflict or 
producing reports on covering migration 
− resonates with journalists around 
the world.
Because the network has its roots within 
media, EJN’s multi-country reports 
and even those that lift the lid on the 
untold stories about the realities of 
how media work and the challenges of 
self-regulation, have credibility inside 
journalism. 
The EJN’s soundings in this period 
of uncertainty are that despite the 
increasingly hostile economic and 
political climate, journalists everywhere 
− from Turkey, Syria and Egypt to 
Pakistan, China and Indonesia − remain 
committed to truth-telling and ethics. 
by Aidan White
The core values of ethical 
journalism are more important 
than ever today, as we fight 
for quality and democracy 
in the media in the digital 
age. While new laws might 
lead to potential censorship, 
a commitment to ethics is 
essential to build public trust. 
“Tech giants that dominate the public 
information space, such as Google, 
Facebook, Amazon and Twitter 
circulate information in a value-free 
environment,” says Aidan White.
Ethical
journalism:
back in the news
Journalism is on the move like never 
before. Today the news business is faster, 
more pressurized, and infinitely more 
complex. The media have learned the 
hard way how the information revolution 
− for all its liberating qualities − is a 
double-edged sword.
While news media can deliver stories 
around the world in seconds and 
communications have the potential to 
build stronger, more informed and more 
engaged communities, the business 
models that paid for journalism in the 
past are broken, and in many cases, 
beyond repair.
With less money to pay for public-interest 
journalism, newsrooms struggle to 
maintain their ethical base. Problems that 
have always been on the radar − political 
bias, undue corporate influence, 
stereotypes and conflicts of interest 
− are now magnified.
The past fifteen years have seen a 
dramatic decline in news journalism, as 
technology has changed the way people 
communicate and the way the media 
business works.

Building public trust
This commitment is a golden asset at 
a time of social transformation, when 
the global communications culture is in 
chaotic transition. To people inside media 
and anyone striving for the key to safe 
and secure communications in future, 
the defence and promotion of ethical 
journalism has become more important 
than ever. 
Fake news, political and corporate 
propaganda, and shameless online abuse 
threaten democracy and open up new 
frontlines for free-speech defenders, 
policymakers, and media professionals 
alike. A toxic mix of digital technology, 
unscrupulous politics and commercial 
exploitation of the new communications 
landscape is creating stress fractures 
across the wider landscape of public 
information.
With this in mind, EJN has promoted a 
new debate about the need to recognize 
why journalism, which is constrained by 
its framework of ethics, is essential for 
building public trust. 
We find that there is no widespread 
yearning for a new code of ethics 
among the media or the public. The 
core values of accuracy, independence 
and responsible reporting – which have 
evolved over the past 150 years – remain 
as relevant as ever, even in these digital 
times. 
What is needed, says EJN, is a new 
partnership with media audiences 
and policymakers to persuade them 
that ethical journalism should be 
strengthened, and that it can be used as 
an inspiration for new programmes to 
promote information literacy. 
Cardinal principles
Today, it’s not just journalists who need to 
watch their language and show respect 
for the facts; everyone with something 
to say in the public information sphere 
needs to show some ethical restraint.
The EJN argues that ethical values 
of journalism – such as fact-based 
communications, humanity and respect 
for others, transparency and owning up 
to errors – are cardinal principles which 
should guide everyone, including social 
media users and citizen journalists. But 
this should be a voluntary process and 
not driven by law.
Worried by online abuse and fake news, 
some governments, even in democratic 
countries, have threatened to fine 
technology companies that don’t act 
to remove malicious and dangerous 
information when it pops up on their 
platforms. This could limit legitimate 
dissent and free speech − this is 
increasingly more likely to happen, unless 
these companies act to support ethical 
communications. 
The problem is that the tech giants that 
dominate the public information space, 
such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and 
Twitter, circulate information in a value-
free environment. They give no priority 
to information as a public good, such 
as professional journalism. For them, 
journalism competes on an equal footing 
in their marketing with other information, 
even if it is malicious and abusive. 
Using algorithms 
to attract clicks
Using sophisticated algorithms and 
limitless databanks that provide access 
to millions of subscribers, this business 
model is driven by one simple objective 
– to encourage “viral information” that 
delivers enough clicks to trigger digital 
advertising. It matters not whether 
information is ethical, true or honest; 
what counts is whether it is sensational, 
provocative, and stimulating enough to 
attract attention.
No matter how sophisticated they are, 
digital robots can’t be encoded with 
ethical and moral values. The best people 
to handle ethical questions are sentient 
human beings – well-trained, informed 
and responsible journalists and editors.
After recent scandals – like the outrage 
over censorship of iconic photographs 
(see p. 16), the live-streaming of torture 
and murder, and major corporations 
complaining about their advertisements 
being placed on websites preaching 
terrorism, hate and child abuse – the 
technology companies have promised to 
act. But will it be enough?
On 3 May 2017, Facebook boss Mark 
Zuckerberg promised to employ 
3,000 content reviewers (to add to the 
company’s 4,500-strong “community 
operations team”), following outrage over 
the broadcasting of a spate of violent 
videos of murder, suicide, and gang rape. 
Facebook has a subscriber base of 
two billion, which means that there is 
one content reviewer per 250,000 or so, 
users. It’s a fraction of what is needed 
to monitor and control the growth of 
unethical, abusive content and the 
dangers posed by propaganda and 
fake news. 
Exploiting 
people’s privacy
One simple answer would be for tech 
companies to accept their role as 
publishers in the digital age and to draw 
upon the vast pool of informed and 
ethical journalists currently displaced 
by the information revolution. We know 
they can afford it – in early 2017, it was 
reported that Facebook was worth 
around $400 billion, and Google more 
than $600 billion. These are among the 
world’s richest companies.
While policymakers and technology 
moguls wring their hands over these 
issues, the use of technology by 
unscrupulous politicians to undermine 
democracy and to interfere in elections 
is growing. And fake news laced with 
malicious lies is all part of the strategy.

The crisis was recently highlighted by 
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the 
World Wide Web. The British scientist and 
academic warned that the online world 
is being overwhelmed by governments 
and digital corporations and that the 
exploitation of people’s privacy is 
squeezing the life out of the internet. 
His criticism highlights the disruptive and 
pernicious threat posed by the marketing 
of false information in politics. 
In an open letter (on 12 March 2017, the 
web’s 28th birthday), Berners-Lee wrote 
of the 2016 election in the United States: 
“... as many as 50,000 variations of adverts 
were being served every single day on 
Facebook, a near-impossible situation 
to monitor.  
And there are suggestions that some 
political adverts – in the US and around 
the world – are being used in unethical 
ways to point voters to fake news sites, 
for instance, or to keep others away from 
the polls. … Is that democratic?” 
Exposing fake news 
It’s a good question, and one that was 
also asked in France on the eve of the 
French presidential election in May 2017, 
when online hackers dumped thousands 
of confidential email files, many of them 
fake, concerning Emmanuel Macron, the 
eventual winner.
This information mountain couldn’t 
be examined, verified or debunked by 
journalists, because French law forbids 
public discussion of election information 
in the last hours before people vote. 
But it circulated freely on social media.

News reporting can be rough and 
ready, but ethical journalism owns up 
to its errors. More importantly, because 
it is fact-based and has civic purpose, 
it also provides a road map for policy 
to build a safe and reliable public 
information space.
Aidan White (UK) is Director of the 
Ethical Journalism Network, and 
the author of a book, To Tell You The 
Truth: the Ethical Journalism Initiative, 
a global review of ethical issues in the 
news (2008). He is the former General 
Secretary of the International Federation 
of Journalists, which he led for twenty-
four years until March 2011. He is a 
founder of the International News Safety 
Institute and the International Freedom 
of Expression Exchange (IFEX).

Aidan White
Director, Ethical Journalism Network
With growing evidence of interference 
in democratic processes around the 
world, the debate over how to expose 
and eliminate fake news is certain to 
intensify. But the discussion is already 
confused by misunderstanding about 
the phenomenon, its origins, and why 
it poses a threat in the first place. 
To try to illustrate the problem, the 
Ethical Journalism Network (EJN) has 
developed a definition for fake news: 
“Information deliberately fabricated 
and published with the intention to 
deceive and mislead others into believing 
falsehoods or doubting verifiable facts.” 
Using this definition, it is easier to 
separate propaganda, “alternative” facts, 
and malicious lies from journalism.
Verashni Pillay
Editor-in-Chief,  
Huffington Post, South Africa
Fake news poisons the atmosphere that 
we all operate in. Because fake news 
exists, audiences are now doubtful 
about all news. It has really damaged 
the relationship between audience 
members and the media. 
Kari Huhta
Diplomatic Editor,  
Helsingin Sanomat, Finland
We easily exaggerate the effect of fake 
news on journalism. I don’t want to be 
flippant about it − it is a serious challenge 
to society and institutionality. The point 
of fake news is not to tell another 
narrative; the main aim of fake news is 
to dismantle the credibility of institutions, 
including journalism, but not only 
journalism. 
Ivor Gaber
Professor of Journalism,  
University of Sussex, United Kingdom
There has always been fake news − ever 
since people realized the power of 
the media to influence public opinion. 
However, the difference today is that 
social media and platforms like Google 
and Facebook enable fake news to spread 
widely and more quickly than ever 
before, and that is the problem. 
Fake news changes journalism in that it 
presents a real challenge to journalism, 
because it’s not always that easy to 
distinguish fake news from real news, 
but it also makes journalism much more 
important. Because if anybody is going 
to call out fake news, it’s the journalist − 
the responsible journalist, that is. I would 
say that in the short term, fake news is a 
problem for journalists. But in the long 
term, it validates them and gives them 
an increased importance in society.
Ricardo Gandour
Journalism Director,  
CBN, Brazilian Radio Network, Brazil
Fake news reinforces a traditional mission 
of journalism, which is trying to shine 
a light in the dark, for societies and 
the general public. Our mission has to 
be reinforced on this core value, trying 
to illuminate the debate, trying to show 
the public where the real facts and 
the real debates are. 
Fake news 
Sound bites on a burning topic
Fake news, or disinformation, 
is not a new phenomenon. 
But today, with the rise of 
digital media, it spreads easily 
and quickly. It is the task of 
responsible journalists and 
trusted news organizations 
to douse the flames of this 
dangerous wildfire and call fake 
news out for what it really is – 
lies. What do journalists think 
about this? We asked a few of 
them to find out.

Lies in social networks.
Ginna Lindberg
Head, Foreign News,  
Swedish Broadcasting, Sweden
All this talk about fake news is affecting 
media audiences, because there is an 
insecurity about what is true and what is 
not. As professional journalists, we need 
to go back to what we do best – we do 
fact-checking, demand answers, and are 
transparent about our (news-gathering) 
methods.
Catarina Carvalho
Editor-in-Chief,  
Global Media Group, Portugal
Fake news is not journalism. Maybe 
we should think about what we [the 
mainstream media] did to journalism 
that has allowed fake news to become so 
easily accepted and so easily done. I think 
we should do some soul-searching to 
know if we are doing the right thing, if we 
are behaving in the right way, if we are 
being ethical in journalism – that could 
prevent fake news from having the power 
and influence it has, and stop the growth 
it has achieved. 
Maria Ressa
Co-founder & CEO, Rappler, 
the Philippines
Rappler, a social news network committed 
to investigative reporting, has documented 
at least 300 websites spreading fake 
news in the Philippines. One of our 
investigations monitored the growth of 
suspicious Facebook accounts that seeded 
fake news into campaign pages during 
the country’s May 2016 elections. 
It took us about three months to 
manually check the information the 
Facebook accounts provided and 
to verify they were fake. 
We found that one nest of twenty-six 
fake accounts is able to influence nearly 
three million Facebook pages. We 
also know that, as of November 2016, 
about 50,000 Facebook accounts can 
be used in targeted campaigns for or 
against politicians or individuals in the 
Philippines. Another fake account was 
linked to over 990,000 members of 
groups supporting one political leader, 
and yet another was connected to an 
estimated 3.8 million members of various 
overseas Filipino organizations and 
buy-and-sell groups.
With about 54 million Facebook users in 
the Philippines, social media is a powerful 
weapon used to silence dissent and 
mould public opinion. Rappler has lived 
through numerous waves of attacks via 
the internet, including from Facebook 
accounts created specifically to harass 
our reporters and contributors. 
This has only made us more determined 
to expose the lies and prevent their 
spread.

Media and Information Literacy (MIL) 
is often called to the rescue these days, 
as the media is threatened on all sides, 
in totalitarian and democratic regimes 
alike. The alert was sounded in France on 
7 January 2015, when the French satirical 
magazine, Charlie Hebdo, was attacked. 
It was an attack on one of the oldest 
forms of media in the world – caricature.
At the time, I was Director of the Centre 
pour l’éducation aux médias et à 
l’information (the centre for media and 
information literacy (CLEMI)). We had 
to prepare students for their return to 
the classroom the day after the attack, 
and meet the needs of teachers and 
parents. We proceeded as we did after 
all major catastrophes – we searched 
our archives for educational fact 
sheets on caricature and propaganda, 
and posted media resources online 
(reference websites, a press review, a 
series of headlines). We also released an 
unpublished interview of Charb, which 
CLEMI had done in 2013, titled, “Can we 
laugh at everything?” The cartoonist and 
journalist, whose real name was Stéphane 
Charbonnier, was murdered in the attack.
This crisis situation showed the strengths 
of MIL, but also its limitations. We were 
well-prepared to respond in terms of 
resources, but we did not anticipate the 
impact of social media.
Like pre-digital media, MIL must take a 
leap forward and include in its concerns 
what data does to the media – it pushes 
information to the fore through the 
regulation of algorithms, linked to people’s 
search histories. It can enclose people in 
a “filter bubble” to reinforce the biases of 
confirmation that support preconceived 
ideas, and reduce the diversity and 
pluralism of ideas by monetizing content 
(clicks by views). It is invasive of privacy 
and threatens fundamental freedoms 
by using digital footprints for purposes 
beyond the user’s control.
Developing a 
critical mind 
against fake news
by Divina Frau-Meigs
Having moved from light surfing, babbling and chatting to data 
mining for the purpose of manipulation and destabilization, 
the digital transformation of the media landscape underscores 
the growing importance of media and information literacy. This form 
of education must rethink the media and the political and ethical 
foundations that legitimize it.

The latest crisis stemming from fake news 
– a blend of rumour, propaganda and plot 
theory – has shaken up MIL. Fake news 
is even stronger than disinformation, 
which is a toxic, but generally discernible 
mixture of truth and lies. Fake news is a 
phenomenon that falls into the category 
of disinformation, but its malicious intent 
is unprecedented, because information 
technology makes it trans-border and 
trans-media, and therefore viral.
Media Information Literacy must 
imperatively take into account the 
digital transformation, which has moved 
from the “blue continent” to the “dark 
continent”. In other words, it has gone 
from surfing, babbling and chatting on 
platforms controlled by the GAFAM (an 
acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook, 
Amazon, Microsoft), to noxious data 
mining for the purpose of massive 
manipulation and destabilization.
It is in this respect that the decoding 
of online propaganda is complex, 
because it is a question of deciphering 
a form of disruptive ideology, which 
is technologically innovative, but 
paradoxically represents a conservative 
global revolution − designed to create 
chaos in existing political systems rather 
than proposing a system of progressive 
political thought.
The return of gossip
This is why MIL is obliged to rethink 
the media and the political and ethical 
foundations that legitimize it. The role of 
social media needs to be revisited, as do 
the exchanges that take place on it. The 
growth of digital media, which transforms 
old audiences into new communities of 
sharing and interpretation, also needs 
to be taken into account. The renewed 
tendency to gossip manifested by social 
media is not insignificant and should not 
be treated with contempt. A conversation 
in undertones that conveys a jumble 
of rumours, half-truths and hearsay, 
gossip makes what is private, public. It 
places authenticity above a truth that is 
perceived as fabricated by elites, far from 
daily and local concerns. 
Social media, then, conveys news where 
truth is uncertain, and falsehoods have 
been used to arrive at the truth or by 
showing that the truth is not all that 
clear-cut. Hence the temptation to 
categorize social media as “post-truth”. 
But this stance reduces its scope and 
refuses to see in it the quest for a 
different truth, when the supposedly 
gold-standard systems of information 
go bankrupt. Social media centres once 
again on the eternal journalistic battle 
between objective facts and commentary 
based on opinion, that is played out in 
these models of influence.
In the information-communication 
sciences, gossip falls within the category 
of social bonding. It fulfills essential 
cognitive functions: monitoring the 
environment, providing help in decision-
making by sharing news, aligning a given 
situation with the values of the group, 
etc. These functions have traditionally 
legitimized the importance of the media. 
But the media is now perceived as 
deficient and biased – this is symptomized 
by the reliance on online gossip, relayed 
by social media. The blame falls less 
on social media than on those who are 
responsible for public debate in real life.
In destabilized political situations all 
around the world, social media is restoring 
meaning to the regulatory role of social 
narrative. It highlights the violations of 
social norms, especially when political 
institutions boast of transparency, 
because secrets are no longer safe. Set 
against newspapers that toe party lines, 
social media is disrupting the norms of 
objectivity, which has become fossilized 
by requiring the presentation of one 
opinion for and one against.

The public shows distrust of the “veracity” 
of this polarized discourse and is 
seduced by the strategy of authenticity. 
It establishes a close relationship of 
trust with the community of members 
that now constitutes the audience, 
and aims to involve them in debates, 
while basing itself on the principle of 
transparency. Thus social media pits the 
ethics of authenticity against the ethics of 
objectivity. 
Explorer, analyst 
and creator
Social media and fake news consequently 
make up a textbook case for MIL, which 
calls upon its fundamental competence 
− critical thinking. But this critical 
thinking must have an understanding 
of the added value of the digital: 
participation, contribution, transparency 
and accountability, of course, but also 
disinformation and the interplay of 
influence.
The critical mind can be exercised and 
trained, and can also act as a form of 
resistance to propaganda and plot theory. 
Young people must be put in a position 
of responsibility while being protected 
by the adults around them: they can be 
prompted to call into question their use 
of social media and to take into account 
the criticism against the consequences 
of their practices. We must also trust their 
sense of ethics, once it is called upon. 
In my Massive Open Online Course on 
Media Education – the MOOC DIY MIL, 
which received the 2016 UNESCO Global 
MIL Award – I offer students three critical 
roles: explorer, analyst and creator. 
The explorer gets to know the media and 
data; the analyst applies the concepts, 
such as source verification, fact-checking, 
respect for privacy; the creator tries 
his/her hand at producing his/her own 
content, sees the consequences of 
his/her choices and makes decisions 
about distribution.
The MOOC has given birth to projects 
such as “Citoyen journaliste sur Twitter” 
(citizen journalist on Twitter) and 
“HoaxBuster”, against plot theories. 
“Data.Path” (2013), by Japanese artist, 
Ryoji Ikeda, whose installations aim 
to make the invisible digital network 
visible and palpable, as it permeates and 
defines our world.

In all cases, the point is to ensure that 
young people acquire the critical thinking 
reflexes of MIL, so that they can avoid 
the traps of hate speech, non-voluntary 
internet traces and fake news. Other 
initiatives exist, including some led by 
UNESCO, which has founded the Global 
Alliance of Partners on MIL (GAPMIL) − 
MIL CLICKS is a recent project to take 
ownership of MIL via social media.
Scaling up MIL
It is also important that MIL exercises 
critical thinking against the media itself. It 
turns out that the top press organizations 
are among the biggest influencers and 
the ones who tend to push rumours, 
on Twitter for example, before they are 
confirmed. The fake news that circulates 
on Facebook, the first of the social media 
to spread it, draws its grain of truth from 
the fact that news professionals are overly 
responsive to the pressure of the scoop, 
transmitted before it is checked, in the 
same manner as the amateurs. And the 
denials do not generate as much buzz 
as the rumours!
It is clear that challenges still exist to 
significantly scaling up MIL. Decision 
makers need convincing that trainers 
must be trained, teachers and journalists 
alike. My research at the Université 
Nouvelle Sorbonne, within the framework 
of the TRANSLIT project of the Agence 
Nationale de la Recherche and the 
UNESCO Chair in “Savoir-devenir in 
sustainable digital development”, 
consists of comparing public policies in 
Europe. It shows that many resources 
and training opportunities exist on the 
ground, provided by organizations or 
teachers on their own initiative, rather 
than sponsored by universities. It points, 
however, to a lag at the public policy 
level, despite the inclusion of MIL in many 
national educational programmes. There 
are few interministerial mechanisms, 
little or no co-regulation, and little or 
no multi-stakeholder coordination. 
The governance of MIL emerges as 
composite, with three models existing 
in different countries: development, 
delegation, or… disengagement 
(D. Frau-Meigs et al, 2017). 
An ethical leap
The good news is that journalists are 
becoming increasingly aware, revising their 
ethics and realizing the value of MIL. Their 
ethical leap can help teachers to reposition 
MIL and provide valid resources to bolster 
resistance in favour of the integrity of data 
and media. Actions that are re-establishing 
the value of in-depth investigation 
are already taking shape − using data 
journalism, which reveals information that 
cannot be obtained otherwise.
Scandals such as the colossal leak of 
confidential documents known as the 
Panama Papers have helped moralize 
political life and restore confidence in the 
press. Other actions are aimed specifically 
at fighting fake news using digital means. 
These include AFP Correspondent, the 
Agence France Presse blog (which reveals 
what happens backstage at a large news 
network); Décodex, featured in the French 
newspaper, Le Monde (which lists sites 
according to their unreliability), Google's 
RevEye (which checks whether an image 
is genuine in three clicks), and Conspi 
Hunter on Spicee, the online TV reports 
and documentaries platform (to debunk 
plot theories).
In order to be deployed fully and to create 
an educated citizenship, MIL’s critical 
thinking must also be applied to the geo-
economy of social media. The GAFAM digital 
platforms, all under California law, have long 
refused to be classified as media companies, 
to avoid all social responsibility and to 
evade any related public-service obligations. 
But algorithmic monitoring has revealed the 
ability of GAFAM to exercise editorial control 
over content that is worth monetizing. 
In doing so, these organizations define 
the truth, because it is real or ethical.
The GAFAM mega-media have so far played 
the card of self-regulation: they make their 
own rules, they decide to remove sites or 
accounts suspected of conveying fake news, 
with no accountability for themselves. But 
they cannot resist the need for a responsible 
model for long – it will probably be a hybrid 
between a “common carrier” and “public 
trustee”, if they want to preserve the trust of 
their online communities. The communities 
could also organize themselves, and even 
circumvent them, to co-regulate the news 
with journalists, as is the case with Décodex. 
The option of co-designing an algorithm 
that would have journalistic ethics and 
fundamental freedoms built into its DNA 
is undoubtedly one of the alternatives to 
come, according to digital logic!

The front page of Aftenposten, 
headlining the open letter from its editor, 
Espen Egil Hansen, to Facebook founder, 
Mark Zuckerberg (8 September 2016).
It is an icon of war photography: the 
black-and-white image reveals a naked 
nine- year-old girl, fleeing from an 
explosion, screaming, her face distorted 
with pain. Taken by Vietnamese-American 
photographer, Nick Ut, during the 
napalm strike on a Vietnamese village 
in 1972, the Pulitzer prize-winning photo, 
“The Terror of War”, raised controversy in 
2016, when Facebook banned it because 
of “inappropriate content”.
“I wrote to Mark Zuckerberg telling him 
that I wouldn’t comply,” remembers 
Espen Egil Hansen, the editor-in-chief of 
Aftenposten, Norway’s largest newspaper, 
who shared the post on Facebook 
and got threatened with a permanent 
ban. Hansen’s bold letter, splashed 
across the front page of Aftenposten, 
condemned Facebook for creating rules 
that first “cannot distinguish between 
child pornography and famous war 
photographs” and then “exclude every 
possible debate.” The letter drew massive 
support and became the starting 
point for a heated discussion around 
Facebook’s intricate censorship rules 
and the control of content through 
newsfeed algorithms. 
With over two billion users worldwide 
and leading more traffic to news sites 
than Google, Facebook has now emerged 
as a major player in news distribution, 
even though it still evades formal 
responsibility by positioning itself as 
a “technical platform”. Nevertheless, 
it has arguably become the largest 
global media site, which has turned 
Mark Zuckerberg into “the most powerful 
editor-in-chief in the world,” according to 
Hansen.” I reminded Zuckerberg that this 
title comes with responsibility. He doesn’t 
just own a tech company, he owns a 
media company.” This is precisely why 
Hansen considers that censoring an 
iconic image of photojournalism because 
of nudity was a bad editorial decision. 
“Disturbing images may not always be 
comfortable to look at, but they are 
the ones that help promote awareness 
in a democratic society,” he says. 
Millions of people post content on 
Facebook’s pages every day, which makes 
the process of selecting information 
case-by-case an obvious challenge. 
Richard Allan, Facebook’s Vice President, 
Public Policy, EMEA (Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa), defends the site’s 
general guidelines, which demand 
that photographs of children under 
18 containing nudity are tracked and 
taken down.  
by Marina Yaloyan
The increasing role that social media sites play in news distribution 
raises several concerns. Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten (Norway) 
and Richard Allan of Facebook come from different worlds, yet face 
a similar challenge.

Norwegian illustrator Inge Grodum’s 
take on the iconic photograph, 
“The Terror of War”, condemning 
Facebook’s censorship for “inappropriate 
content”. The nine-year-old girl in 
the photo, known as “the Napalm girl”, 
is Kim Phuc Phan Thi, UNESCO Goodwill 
Ambassador since 1994.
Algorithm – the world’s 
new editor-in-chief
There is little or no significant difference 
between Facebook and traditional 
news venues when it comes to editorial 
choice. “In the same way in which an 
editor-in-chief of Fox News is responsible 
for the editorial content of Fox News, 
Mark Zuckerberg is responsible for 
the editorial content of Facebook,” 
insists Hansen. 
The only real difference between the 
two is the largely misunderstood and 
controversial newsfeed algorithm that 
traditional media editors do not use. 
 “We want to keep our essence. You are 
your own editor and you choose what 
you want to see,” states Richard Allan, 
regarding Facebook’s policy. 
Yet, he does admit that with the 
“The Terror of War” photo, this policy 
fell short. “Just to be clear, we question 
ourselves all the time. When we face a 
new situation we haven’t anticipated 
before, we ask ourselves, what should 
we do now? Should we change our 
rules?” he stated during the colloquium, 
Journalism under Fire, at UNESCO in 
March 2017. Two months later, Facebook 
announced that it would add 3,000 more 
people to its 4,500-strong community 
operations team. The newly-adopted, 
more flexible, approach requires content 
reviewers to treat news as an exception. 
“There are occasional photos of naked 
children where the public interest of the 
publication of that photo and, in this 
case, the consent of the person involved, 
outweighs the regular policy,” Allan says.

“Algorithms may create the so-called 
filter bubbles, which reinforce a negative 
trend of our time – one that leads to more 
polarized communities,” says Hansen. 
“More and more people live in bubbles, 
where they only get the information 
they want, and communicate only 
with like-minded people.” From this 
perspective, the criteria of selection used 
by algorithms to classify information 
become crucially important. 
Allan, however, compares the newsfeed 
to a periodical subscription and denies 
imposing any content on Facebook’s 
readers. According to him, algorithms 
merely allow for the arranging of 
periodicals in a way that is most 
convenient for the reader. The challenge, 
however, lies in the large quantity of 
newsfeeds available. “What we find 
is that people sign up for a thousand 
different feeds when they only have 
time to read twenty of them,” he says. 
“The thousand feeds are still there but 
this obviously creates a selection process, 
as we pick those that are going to appear 
on the top.” 
Favouring the information that readers 
prefer can be a slippery road. According 
to Hansen, it is a “convenient strategy 
when watching Netflix [the United States-
based streaming service]” but remains a 
“questionable principle for the free flow 
of information in a society.” 
Fake news – real 
solutions?
On a positive note, social media sites 
do breach barriers and make it easier for 
people to express themselves. “When 
I wrote my letter to Mark Zuckerberg, 
I published it in a small paper in a small 
country, but the story immediately went 
viral. Ironically, I think it was Facebook 
itself that made the story so popular,” 
recalls Hansen, whose own newspaper 
has more than 340, 000 followers on 
Facebook. However, he quickly admits 
that the opportunity given to everyone 
to publish information is a double-edged 
sword that may lead to disinformation. 
“It is obviously easier today to mislead 
very large parts of populations. I wonder 
if, as a society, we are actually prepared 
for the alarming trends that we are 
witnessing,” he says. 
Meanwhile, algorithms continue to shape 
the reading habits of 1.28 billion daily 
active Facebook users (March 2017), 
or one-fifth of the world’s population. 
Facebook scans and analyzes all the 
information posted by any given user in 
the previous week, taking into account 
every page that he or she has liked, all the 
groups he/she belongs to and everybody 
he/she follows. Then, according to a 
closely-guarded and constantly evolving 
formula, the algorithms rank the posts in 
the precise order they believe the user 
will find worthwhile. 
However, the very nature of algorithms 
can turn them into controversial, 
and even dangerous, tools. 
Disturbing images may not 
always be comfortable to 
look at, but they are the ones 
that help promote awareness 
in a democratic society

In a series of scandals related to fake 
news that shook Facebook in 2016, 
the company has been accused of 
influencing the United States Presidential 
election, by spreading fake news stories 
and creating filter bubbles that isolated 
voters from other opinions. Overall, fake 
news about US politics alone accounted 
for 10.6 million of the 21.5 million total 
shares, reactions, and comments these 
English-language stories generated 
on Facebook this year, according to 
one analysis. A hoax about former US 
President Barack Obama generated more 
than 2.1 million comments, reactions and 
shares on Facebook in just two months. 
No wonder that in order to curb criticism, 
Facebook has introduced a corrective 
fact-checking programme. Starting 
in May 2017, stories that have been 
signalled by users as unreliable are 
verified by independent fact-checking 
experts and labelled as “disputed”. 
“We are not going to remove these,” 
stresses Richard Allan. “On one hand, 
we don’t want to be the arbiters of truth 
and edit content. On the other, we would 
like to build an informed community, 
as we have a responsibility to society.”
Hansen views the acknowledgement 
of this responsibility as key. He praises 
the positive improvements that 
Facebook has adopted since his letter in 
Aftenposten first came into the spotlight. 
“Mark Zuckerberg gave an interview to 
the New York Times, where he said that 
the controversy around this letter was 
an eye-opener and made him realize 
that he needed to change the way 
Facebook functions.” 
This realization and subsequent change 
become crucial, especially in the wake 
of social media’s broad impact on 
traditional media and its ever-growing 
omnipresence in our daily lives. 
An open letter that 
prompts change
“…Listen, Mark, this is serious! 
First you create rules that don’t 
distinguish between child 
pornography and famous war 
photographs. Then you practise 
these rules without allowing space 
for good judgement. Finally you 
even censor criticism against and a 
discussion about the decision – and 
you punish the person who dares to 
voice criticism… 
The free and independent media 
have an important task in bringing 
information, even including 
pictures, which sometimes may be 
unpleasant, and which the ruling 
elite and maybe even ordinary 
citizens cannot bear to see or hear, 
but which might be important 
precisely for that reason… 
The media have a responsibility 
to consider publication in every 
single case. This may be a heavy 
responsibility. Each editor must 
weigh the pros and cons. This 
right and duty, which all editors 
in the world have, should not be 
undermined by algorithms encoded 
in your office in California.
Facebook’s Mission Statement states 
that your objective is to “make the 
world more open and connected”. 
In reality you are doing this in a 
totally superficial sense. If you 
will not distinguish between child 
pornography and documentary 
photographs from a war, this will 
simply promote stupidity and fail 
to bring human beings closer to 
each other. 
To pretend that it is possible to create 
common, global rules for what may 
and what may not be published, only 
throws dust into people’s eyes…”

Espen Egil Hansen to Mark Zuckerberg

Aftenpost on 8 September 2016.)

The November 2016 election of Donald 
Trump for the highest office in the United 
States is the most dramatic example of the 
all-pervasive nature of social media. The 
mainstream media hated him passionately, 
yet the former kingmakers could do 
absolutely nothing as he forced them to 
do his bidding in order not to commit 
commercial suicide in full sight of their readers 
and viewers. And so Donald Trump became 
the first ever US President of Social Media. 
Anyone can be a star
At the dawn of the social media era, the 
old guard dismissed it as a tool for young 
people. Enter YouTube: the world’s biggest 
television repository and video-hosting 
service which creates almost zero content 
itself, but is the haven for all the wannabes 
on earth. Anyone, anywhere in the world 
today, can be whatever they dream of 
– singers, chefs, boxers, media stars. 
The sky is the limit and it’s all for free. 
PewDiePie (born Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg 
in Sweden, October 1989), a web-based 
comedian and video producer, became 
the uncrowned king of YouTube, with 
almost 55 million subscribers! Two of the 
most successful YouTubers in Lithuania 
– Whydotas (Vaidotas Grinceviĉius) and 
The3dvinas (Edvinas Navikas) − have more 
subscribers than the four national TV 
channels combined. 
Of course, new media is not all positive, 
and sometimes comes at a heavy price. 
Fake news, virtual mob lynching, trolls and 
baseless accusations abound – it’s a free-
for-all. There are no filters or editing, and no 
need to exercise restraint or decency if you 
choose not to. 
We are in the throes of a media 
transformation, forced by the ascension 
of the internet. As journalists, we must 
embrace the revolution, and shed any 
of our inhibitions to go digital. With our 
professional qualities, we still have the edge 
over most of the novices out there today. 
The new technologies allow for 
unprecedented freedom, especially in 
countries where the press is controlled 
by the government. Now is the perfect 
time to voice your opinion, and make it 
resonate across the globe. Interacting with 
your audience is critical − instant audience 
feedback is a potent tool. 
Crowdfunded 
by viewers
The changes in journalism can be viewed 
as a positive development. It has forced us 
to be creative, and to invent new business 
models in order to survive, as in our case. 
Propelled by the shock of losing my TV 
programme on Lithuanian television, 
I decided to fight back. Liberty TV was 
founded by me in September 2016. It is a 
completely independent internet television 
channel, crowdfunded by viewers. 
The digital revolution has brought 
monumental changes and 
challenges to the media industry. 
Journalists are best-placed to 
adapt to the new media landscape 
if they embrace new technologies, 
reinvent themselves, and adopt 
new business models. The story 
of Lithuania’s Liberty TV, an 
independent television channel 
broadcast on the internet 
and financed by the public, 
is proof of this.
The digital age is upon us, whether we like 
it not. And if you belong to the media old 
guard, it is quite likely you will not like it. 
Traditional print media and television have 
been caught off guard – technologically, 
financially, and creatively – by the digital 
revolution, and are experiencing the 
biggest challenges they have ever faced. 
Are they up to it? Not really. But they have 
no choice – they can either sink or swim. 
The advent of the internet, nearly thirty 
years ago, has hooked the world onto one 
of the most powerful drugs available to 
modern societies – free and lightning-fast 
access to information. 
Before they knew what hit them, a second 
wave – social media – hit the old guard. It 
was bigger and stronger than the web, and 
with more severe consequences. Social 
media companies gained the upper hand 
as paid subscriptions to newspapers and 
magazines dwindled, and TV channels 
started to lag behind the thousands of 
news websites on the internet. 
Suddenly everyone became the 
media – cameraman, editor, storyteller, 
journalist, promoter – all rolled in one. 
The gatekeepers of information saw their 
gates come crashing down, as they lost the 
biggest privilege of all – the right to decide 
what is important and what is not.

duration they choose, with no obligation to 
continue. For a nation of less than 3 million 
people, this was phenomenal. We are 
also funded by commercial sponsors who 
are prepared to accept that there will be 
no strings attached. 
A proven 
business model
Putting myself and my team into the hands 
of the public was the biggest gamble 
of my journalistic career. Would they be 
willing to pay for something they could 
get for free but would cease to exist if they 
didn’t pay for it? Are we public-spirited 
enough to support independent media 
by contributing to it? Media experts in 
Lithuania were sceptical. But we went 
ahead nevertheless.
In March 2017, we suggested that our 
viewers use their ability to direct two per 
cent of their taxes to Liberty TV. We are 
curious to see how much funding we are 
able to raise with this initiative. 
In four months, Liberty TV became the 
biggest media entity on Lithuanian 
YouTube, with some of its programmes 
reaching six-figure viewership numbers 
and competing with the most popular 
shows on mainstream TV. In eight months, 
media experts started to admit that they 
had been wrong, and started reporting 
about our plans to expand. 
Our business model is new and falls 
in line with the digital revolution, but 
it is not unique. Similar crowdfunded 
journalistic projects have been launched 
in Holland, Switzerland, India, and several 
other countries. 
It is not easy; it is the hardest job I have ever 
done in my career of almost twenty years. 
But it is the only way I would like to go 
further as a journalist. And it is the digital 
revolution that gave me this chance.
Andrius Tapinas is a Lithuanian 
journalist and writer. He founded Liberty 
TV in 2016 and is the host of its flagship 
programme, “Hang in there”. Tapinas 
is one of the most popular persons 
on Lithuanian social media, with over 
130,000 Facebook followers.

We broadcast fifteen programmes each 
month, and add at least three more 
in the autumn of 2017. The content 
includes political satire in Lithuanian 
and Russian, talk shows, investigative 
journalism, political analysis and positive 
documentaries. 
Our staff (made up of full-time and 
freelance professionals) includes a 
full technical crew – from editors to 
cameramen, journalists and script-writers. 
A small administrative team also handles 
communication for the channel. Our 
flagship programmes are filmed in theatres 
with high-definition cameras, in front of live 
audiences of 200 to 250 people. 
We are a non-profit, so we have to make 
sure we balance our books. This calls for 
austerity. Most of our equipment is rented, 
or comes with the professionals we hire. 
Most of our work is done online, and we 
use a tiny office space for meetings and 
editing. We plan to relocate to a larger 
office in autumn 2017.

Some of us were forced into journalism 
− we had little choice. In 1998, El Salvador 
was emerging from a long civil war and 
we were feeling our way forward, with 
no towering figure to guide us. But we 
were convinced that the post-war period 
needed a revitalised press, with a fresh 
perspective and independent voices. 
The country deserved a new journalism, 
and we provided it. 
El Faro [The Beacon] was started in May 
1998, with absolutely no funding. That’s 
why we launched it on the internet, at 
a time when barely two per cent to five 
per cent of the Salvadorian population 
had access to it. Our existence depended 
on new technologies, because we could 
never have afforded the expense of 
running a printed newspaper. Opting for 
the internet turned out to be a very lucky 
decision for us, given that at the time, we 
were a million miles away from imagining 
the influence the web would have on 
the future of humanity. 
In the beginning, we put El Faro together 
in our spare time. We were gradually 
joined by young talents who wanted 
to cut their teeth using this new media. 
For several years we made zero profit, 
but we also had virtually no expenses 
− each of us worked for free, from our 
homes. This also helped us to forge 
our independent spirit. When the 
industry started to take the internet 
seriously and readers started looking 
for news online, we were already firmly 
established on the web. 
We compensated for the absence of 
mentors and teachers by reading, and 
with healthy doses of self-criticism. 
Our paper matured as we learned from 
our mistakes – we constantly reflected 
on, debated and discussed what we 
were doing. 
Traitors to the nation
As the years went by, we eventually 
graduated to paid journalistic jobs and 
a proper office. Many of the journalism 
students who had worked with us 
from the start are now co-owners and 
shareholders of the newspaper. In our 
nearly twenty years of existence, we 
have become one of the most respected 
publications in Latin America.
Most of our efforts are concentrated on 
investigative and narrative reporting, 
covering six main themes: violence and 
organized crime, corruption, war crimes, 
culture, poverty and inequality, and 
politics. These are subjects which, in our 
view, are the least reported. But they are 
also central to any explanation of why, 
more than twenty years after the end 
of the war, El Salvador remains one of 
the most violent countries in the world, 
riddled with inequalities and poverty, 
and largely dependent on the two 
million Salvadorian expatriates – a third 
of the population – who send money 
back home. 
A beacon, 
thanks to the internet
El Faro and Salvadorian photographer 
Fred Ramos have launched the “The Last 
Outfit of the Missing” campaign, which 
involves publishing a series of photos to 
enable the families of missing persons 
to recognize their clothing and identify 
them. Ramos received support from the 
Institute of Legal Medicine to exhume 
bodies from unmarked graves.
by Carlos Dada
Journalism is going through a global crisis. The all-pervasive 
reach of the internet and social media have meant that rumours and 
false information are rife. But these very spaces can be used to create 
better journalism, as El Faro, the pioneering web-based Salvadorian 
newspaper, has illustrated, in its twenty years of existence.

The paradox in this profession is that the 
better you are at it, the fewer friends you 
keep. We have been called traitors to 
the nation, protectors of gangs, enemies 
of private property, and of revolution. 
In a country polarized between the two 
extremes that waged the civil war, right-
wing governments accuse us of being 
left wing, and those on the left say we 
lean to the right. We have received some 
very unkind messages from drug dealers, 
war criminals, gang leaders, corrupt 
politicians, business executives, the army 
and the police. These threats have forced 
us to take legal action several times. 
These messages of discontent also come 
from readers sometimes. A few years ago, 
we published an article that denounced 
the massacre of young delinquents, 
carried out in cold blood by the police. 
Several readers complained that we 
were hampering the work of the police, 
because gangs are the main source of 
violence in El Salvador. We understand 
these reactions very well, but there is no 
question of us changing our reporting to 
satisfy our readers’ aspirations, or alleviate 
their anxieties − populist journalism 
would be irresponsible, harmful 
and immoral. 
A Central American 
forum
More recently, we have sought to extend 
our coverage to neighbouring countries − 
Honduras and Guatemala − which suffer 
similar levels of violence, corruption 
and social decay. Though we haven’t yet 
achieved the systematic coverage we 
would like, we have made good progress 
in setting up a network with journalists in 
the region, who can collaborate with us 
on investigative stories. 
After two decades of growth, many 
journalists at El Faro have published 
books. We also do radio broadcasts, make 
documentaries and hold exhibitions 
and conferences. This is because we 
feel the need to pass on our knowledge 
to future generations. 
In May every year, we hold the Central 
American Journalism Forum − a week of 
workshops, conferences and exhibitions 
with dozens of invited speakers from all 
over Latin America, the United States 
and Europe. The best journalists from the 
region and abroad lead workshops on 
investigative journalism, radio journalism, 
photography and reporting. More than 
a hundred journalists, mainly from 
Central America, took part in 2017.
The forum is the leading event in our 
permanent programme of training 
and conferences, aimed at improving 
the quality of journalism in Central 
America. This is the poorest region of the 
continent − putting our journalists in 
touch with their colleagues throughout 
Latin America opens up new possibilities 
for collaboration, to cover the issues that 
increasingly extend beyond the borders 
of our countries. 
A Salvadorian journalist, Carlos Dada 
founded El Faro in 1998. He has covered 
events in Iraq, Venezuela, Mexico, 
Guatemala and Honduras. His articles 
are published in Latin America, USA, 
Bosnia and Spain. He was awarded the 
María Moors Cabot prize by Columbia 
University, New York, in 2011. 
 
“It is impossible 
to photograph 
a subject with 
objectivity, but it 
is possible to show 
a story with truth,” 
says Salvadorian 
photographer 
Juan Carlos, who 
took this photo of 
a bench that bears 
traces of a murder 
in a public park 
in Chalchuapa, 
El Salvador.

I am allergic to the idea of investigative 
journalism being termed a “mission” or 
“calling”. It is an individual choice born 
out of need, combined with a set of 
skills and a particular character, which 
is persistent, sometimes in the face 
of abuse. My colleague, Inga Spriņģe, 
once explained that she does it for 
her grandmother, who was never 
in a position to confront the Soviet 
authorities with tough questions!
Spriņģe’s resolve, and mine, to keep 
questioning the powers that be, was 
tested when Diena – the newspaper 
we worked for − was sold by its 
publisher, Bonnier [the Swedish media 
conglomerate], to local oligarchs 
who had tried to silence it for years. 
This happened in the midst of a deep 
economic crisis, and declining sales and 
readership for the paper, which took 
the web seriously way too late.
Taking the plunge
A group of us who had worked for Diena 
– considered the best newspaper in the 
Baltics − never gave up on the idea that 
in a democracy, investigative journalism 
is fundamentally necessary to hold those 
in power accountable. This is equally 
true in countries with authoritarian 
regimes, where the personal costs for 
the journalists involved is even higher. 
Investigative 
journalism:
against the odds
by Sanita Jemberga
Investigative journalism is one of the pillars of a well-functioning 
democracy. But its future cannot be guaranteed without financial 
autonomy. The case of Re: Baltica, a centre for investigative 
journalism in Latvia, is a good case in point.

Without investigative writing, we would 
have to subsist on a diet of daily news, 
paid government content and celebrity 
gossip. Journalism would then work not 
as a watchdog, but as a lapdog for those 
in power. 
To prepare ourselves for the change, 
Spriņģe spent a year in the United 
States, studying non-profit models for 
investigative journalism. She returned to 
Latvia to establish the Baltic Center for 
Investigative Journalism, Re:Baltica, in 
2011. Run by a co-operative of journalists, 
the centre provides the results of its 
investigations to the mainstream media, 
free of charge. 
The idea was relatively new in Europe, 
but, by 2012, there were already more 
than a hundred non-profit centres for 
investigative journalism in over fifty 
countries. Everyone predicted Re:Baltica 
would be dead in a year, but they have 
been proved wrong. We celebrate 
our sixth anniversary in August 2017. 
There are clear reasons why we have 
survived and thrived.
The first is the ability to put in a lot 
of hard work and take the plunge. 
We realized early on that if our incomes 
depended solely on international donors 
(which, for a small language and a 
relatively poor media market is almost 
the only funding available), we would 
not last long. Sixty per cent of our budget 
comes from grants, and the rest from our 
personal incomes, earned from teaching, 
consulting, researching and writing 
scripts for documentaries. We also get 
donations from our readers and private 
donors. We are still never certain how 
we will survive beyond a year. 
Exposing more 
than corruption 
Finding the right partners is key. We are 
also frugal with costs – we choose not 
to spend a lot on our website or office 
space. Re:Baltica staff consist of two core 
editorial people, a graphic designer and 
an accountant, and then we hire people 
according to the needs of a particular 
story – up to twenty or thirty journalists 
and translators a year.  
While our work is available for free to 
all media outlets who want to publish 
it, we have a dedicated set of partners 
in television, radio, print and online 
with whom we co-operate closely. 
As these media outlets do not compete 
directly, the message is multiplied: 
and so is the impact.
Investigative journalism is not just about 
exposing corruption. We did participate 
in the Panama Papers investigation – 
the giant leak of more than 11.5 million 
financial and legal documents, which 
exposed the names of politicians, 
criminals and the rogue industry around 
the globe, and where they hid their 
cash. Spearheaded by the International 
Consortium of Investigative Journalists 
(ICIJ), the colossal global project made 
headlines worldwide, won a Pulitzer Prize, 
and was the basis for new laws being 
passed in some countries.

But much of our work focuses on social 
inequalities in Latvia, which is the 
biggest threat to the country in the 
long term. We cover a range of social 
problems − from the shortcomings of our 
education system, to the poor salaries 
paid to staff by large supermarket chains. 
The work is not always glamorous − our 
colleagues went undercover to work in 
a fish factory to expose the conditions 
of workers there. 
Our latest exposé was about a Latvian 
financier who featured in the Panama 
Papers and was connected with the 
French elections in 2017. We are 
also working on a series of articles 
to expose fake news and its origins 
on the Baltic internet.
No strings attached
I am not very optimistic about the 
future of investigative journalism. But 
I am convinced that the rise to power of 
authoritarian regimes will make journalism 
great again: by exposing a need to 
separate the truth from “alternative facts” 
(or in other words, lies), and clickbaits from 
real reporting. Non-profit organizations 
have proven to be a possible alternative 
to mainstream media at a time when 
investigative journalism is disappearing 
from newsrooms. 
But many of these non-profit ventures 
will die as institutional donors lose 
interest and philanthropy is scarce, 
especially in countries which need 
investigative reporting the most. 
Investigative journalism must be 
recognized as a public good and assigned 
funding, there is very limited hope for it. 
International organizations, which 
are keen to train journalists and fund 
conferences and campaigns, must devise 
mechanisms to publicly, openly and 
competitively fund the investigative 
content as a public good, with no 
strings attached. That is the only way 
investigative journalism will survive. 
Sanita Jemberga is a Latvian 
investigative journalist who has worked 
in print and television since 1996. 
She is executive director and editor 
at the non-profit Baltic Center for 
Investigative Journalism, Re:Baltica, and 
teaches media literacy at the Stockholm 
School of Economics in Riga. 
Cartooning for peace
To celebrate World Press Freedom 
Day on 3 May 2017, UNESCO and 
Cartooning for Peace are holding 
an online exhibition of fifteen 
editorial cartoons. 
Founded in 2006 by Kofi Annan, 
Nobel Peace Prize laureate (2001) 
and former Secretary-General of 
the United Nations, and French 
cartoonist Plantu, the Cartooning 
for Peace network includes 
162 cartoonists from fifty-eight 
countries across the globe. 
This international network of 
editorial cartoonists uses humour 
to fight for the respect of cultural 
diversity, human rights, and 
other freedoms.
The editorial cartoon is a powerful 
tool, because of its ability to 
transcend language and cultures. 
It can be used to foster cross-cultural 
dialogue and fuel the debate about 
fundamental issues such as freedom 
of expression, peace and tolerance.

Fake news: Information which is 
false and rigged with the intent to 
harm. According to Les Décodeurs, the 
fact-checking section of the French 
newspaper Le Monde, fake news “uses the 
codes and forms of the traditional press 
to masquerade as a journalistic exercise”.
Hoax: A deceptive message broadcast 
via email and the internet. These could 
be in the form of rumours, alarmist news 
or false premises to solicit donations. 
The motivations behind a hoax can be 
political or financial (remuneration is 
usually based on the number of clicks 
generated). The term is less used these 
days and has been largely supplanted 
by ‘fake news’.
Post-truth: Declared Word of the 
Year 2016 by the Oxford Dictionaries, 
the adjective is defined as “relating to 
or denoting circumstances in which 
objective facts are less influential in 
shaping public opinion than appeals 
to emotion and personal belief”. 
The term was first used in the 1990s, 
and popularized by the 2016 Brexit 
and American presidential election 
campaigns. Post-truth describes 
a political rhetoric which is no longer 
concerned with facts and demonstrates 
the public’s loss of confidence in 
traditional media and institutions.
Virality: The rapid circulation of 
information – true or false – via 
the internet and social networks. 
The virality of information relies on 
user-based recommendations. This is 
the online version of “word of mouth”, 
on an infinitely broader scale.
Lexicon for the digital age
As social media has invaded 
our daily lives, new terms and 
concepts have infiltrated into 
our vocabulary. Here is a quick 
overview of some of these terms 
for our readers.
Algorithm: The term is a combination of 
the Latin word algorismus, named after 
Al Khwarizmi − a ninth-century Persian 
mathematician who introduced the 
decimal system to the Western world − 
and the Greek word, arithmos, meaning 
number. In today’s digital world, an 
algorithm is a sequence of instructions, 
automatically executed by a computer. 
Algorithms are now synonymous with 
machine intelligence as opposed to 
human intelligence, and are being 
used in all fields − from search-engine 
queries to financial markets and user-
recommended information selection.
Confirmation bias: The tendency to 
favour information which reinforces our 
beliefs, while ignoring or underestimating 
the beliefs that contradict them.
Filter bubble: The concept was 
defined by American internet activist 
Eli Pariser, chief executive of Upworthy, 
a website for “meaningful” viral content, 
and co-founder of Avaaz.org, the 
internet activism site. According to 
him, the algorithms of social networks 
filter information − by analyzing 
users’ ‘likes’ and ‘shares’ − and provide 
personalized content corresponding 
to these preferences. This eventually 
confines users to a “bubble” of social 
and political opinions.
Alternative fact: A term to denote 
a gross untruth, or falsehood. The 
expression was first used in January 
2017 by Kellyanne Conway, counselor 
to United States President Donald 
Trump, when addressing the controversy 
about the exact number of people 
who attended his inauguration.

This is how Marion describes Gran Chaco, 
the vast arid plain that the country shares 
with Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia. And 
for good reason: “We had to drive for 
fourteen hours before we arrived at our 
destination,” she emphasizes.
Their destination: the settlement of 
the Xákmok Kásek. According to the 
International Work Group for Indigenous 
Affairs (IWGIA), the Xákmok Kásek 
(or ‘many little parrots’) are one of the 
531 indigenous communities of the 
Paraguayan Chaco area. They have been 
progressively ejected from their ancestral 
lands since the end of the nineteenth 
century. In 2010, the community 
consisted of 268 individuals belonging 
to sixty-six families. On 24 August 
2010, after thirty years of legal battles, 
the Xákmok Kásek won a court case 
in the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights(IACHR), ordering the Paraguayan 
authorities to return 10,700 hectares 
of land to the community. Spurred on 
by this judgement and in spite of the 
reticence of the state to follow through, 
the community moved back onto its 
territory in early 2015. 
Five continents, five years of encounters, 
tens of thousands of kilometres travelled, 
and in the end, there is one single 
conclusion: we are ONE humankind. This 
is how French photographer and visual 
artist Bēni sums up the IDENTiTESproject 
odyssey, which he launched in 2013. It is 
a multifaceted photographic adventure 
that is taking him to the four corners 
of the planet. From Hanoi to La Paz, via 
Accra, Bēni’s lens captures the faces of 
the world and brings them together in 
an impressive series of portraits. “We set 
off for somewhere else, for something 
different, for the other, only to end up 
finding ourselves,” he explains. 
Let’s join him in Paraguay, on the Ruta 
Transchaco, National Route 9, the unique 
800- kilometre highway that links the 
capital, Asunción, with the Bolivian border. 
It is 2015. IDENTiTESproject#3 is in full 
swing. The third stage of Bēni’s project 
is in South America, and it is the first 
time he is not travelling by himself. He is 
accompanied by the Laumonier siblings, 
Marion and Paul, who are assisting him 
and documenting the journey. After 
four months of crossing through Chile, 
Argentina and Uruguay, we find them in a 
vehicle heading towards “one of the most 
isolated regions anywhere on earth today”. 
My face, my land

The IDENTiTESproject cameras were 
there at exactly the right time to capture 
the event. “They’d been on the site for 
less than ten days,” says Marion. It was 
a moment of great exhilaration − the 
atmosphere was electrifying. But the return 
to their ancestral lands has been far from 
triumphant. “They’ve been living in terrible 
conditions, sleeping in tents, catching 
fish for food and drinking from ponds of 
stagnant water”, she adds. Intensive cattle-
farming and soya cultivation have caused 
often irreversible harm to the soil and the 
forest. The very identity of the indigenous 
people is being severely tested – their 
beliefs, modes of subsistence and cultural 
practices are all intimately connected to 
their ancestral lands. 
Bēni was in Paraguay at the time, to 
organize the project’s flagship − a 
co•creation workshop. It is no accident 
that he decides to place the land at the 
centre of the artistic sequence. The end 
result is a unique moment of sharing, 
filled with emotion, and deeply spiritual. 
“The village chief told us that this 
project has been especially important 
for the members of his community. Even 
though they were still very bound to the 
struggle to regain their land, working 
with us has given them the opportunity 
to think about something else, to have 
some different time together, just for 
themselves,” explains Marion.
Today, the community has regained 
possession of 7,901 hectares, or about 
seventy-three per cent of the lands 
that are rightfully theirs, according to 
Oscar Ayala from the NGO, Tierraviva, 
which represented the Xákmok Kásek 
at the IACHR in 2010.

LINKS Project
According to the Council on 
Hemispheric Affairs, Paraguay 
has one of the fastest rates of 
deforestation in the world. Launched 
in 2002, UNESCO’s Local and 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems 
(LINKS) programme has brought 
to international attention the role 
of indigenous communities in 
conserving biodiversity and adapting 
to the effects of climate change. 
The return of the Xákmok Kásek 
is therefore cause for hope. Their 
ancestral knowledge, together with 
the government programme for the 
reforestation of Chaco, announced 
in February 2017, should make it 
possible to rehabilitate the land.

At the time this issue of the UNESCO 
Courier is published, Bēni is travelling 
across Europe, on the final stage of 
his project. His round-the-world tour 
ends in Paris in August 2017, with a 
special initiative – the project team 
attempts to create a massive European 
face in collaboration with several 
French artists. Each time he returns to 
France, Bēni also organizes the BACKTO 
exhibitions, representing the different 
stages of the project – photographic 
portraits, co•creation and street- gallery 
workshops. These ephemeral galleries are 
mounted in the public space. The profits 
from these exhibitions and other public 
awareness-raising initiatives are donated 
to the local communities featured, to help 
support their development.
Bēni says he wants to take a break once 
the European tour is over, “to take a 
bit of time, maybe a year, off.” But he is 
already thinking about a book, which, 
according to him, “will bring the five 
continents together and enable us – and 
especially me − to understand what has 
been going on since 2013.” He also plans 
to make a documentary and organize 
a major exhibition, tracing the entire 
journey. He already has a title for this, 
which is the very DNA of the project: 
“ONE WORLD • ONE PEOPLE”. 
Back in Paris, Bēni and his 
team prepare an exhibition 
on IDENTiTEproject#3. 
The BACKTOamerica exhibition 
traces the third stage of the project, 
aiming to raise public awareness 
about the Xákmok Kásek community.
To use as visuals for communications, 
the IDENTiTESproject selects one portrait from 
each leg of the journey, onto which a world 
map is applied to symbolize the existence of just 
ONE humanity, in all its diversity.

Ideas
It is with these considerations in mind 
that, several years ago, I suggested that 
we should explore a new concept − 
“humanitude” − in reference to Negritude, 
a concept I inherited from my mentor, 
the Martiniquan poet, Aimé Césaire.
I use this concept of humanitude to 
translate what, in Africa, we call maaya 
(in Bamanankan, the Bambara language), 
neddaaku (in Fulfulde, the Fula language), 
boroterey (in Songhay, the Songhay 
language), nite (in Wolof ), ubuntu (in 
the Bantu languages), and many more. 
There are so many terms that literally 
mean “the quality of being human”. 
Humanitude
or how to quench
the thirst for humanity
by Adama Samassékou 
Faced with the failure of the 
western model of development, 
which puts the culture of having 
before the culture of being, it 
is becoming urgent to develop 
a different project for society 
– one that is founded upon 
humanitude, a concept that 
explores openness to the Other, 
the only possible way out for 
a disenchanted world.
It has become commonplace to say 
that our world, which is in the grips 
of a multidimensional and seemingly 
never-ending crisis, is in very, very bad 
shape. This crisis, in fact, reveals a loss of 
meaning, reinforced by a trend towards 
the homogenization of the world’s 
cultures, brought on by an accelerated 
globalization of markets. This is leading 
to a veritable dehumanization of relations 
between individuals, peoples, and states. 
The recent environmental, energy, 
demographic, and digital challenges 
− added to the existing inequalities and 
poverty − accentuate the widespread 
feeling of existential angst and a lack of 
confidence in the future. 
The most prevalent “development model” 
today is founded upon what I call a 
culture of “having”, of profit. It has already 
shown its limitations, and the current 
crisis confirms that it is now bankrupt. 
This “western model” is responsible for 
the Eurocentrism and Western-centrism 
seen in international relations, both 
in terms of goods and intellectual 
production. As a result, a paradigm shift 
towards the promotion of values that are 
more aligned with a culture of “being”, 
has become imperative.

Ideas
Connecting human 
to human 
African societies have always put “being”, 
rather than “having”, at the centre of 
their development. In more global 
terms, certain non-European societies 
have a cosmovision that puts “being” 
at the centre of all relationships with 
the world. This vision is characterized by 
a permanent search for non-conflictual, 
peaceful relations, oriented towards 
a consensus with others and harmony 
with the environment, in the widest 
sense. For a long time, this conception 
of the world was also shared with 
the West, before it became dominated 
by a form of modernity based upon 
market and material fundamentalism 
and individualistic accumulation. 
Humanitude is our permanent openness 
towards the Other, our relationships 
as human being to human being. It 
demands a permanent relationship 
of solidarity, free from calculation – a 
spontaneous impulse of welcoming the 
Other. This humanitude makes it possible 
to “connect human to human” – to use 
Césaire’s beautiful phrase − and is the 
basis for a culture of “being”, as opposed 
to a totalitarian culture of “having”, which 
leads to permanently conflictual relations 
of acquisition, if not domination.
In a remarkable presentation at the 
Ubuntu symposium, held in Geneva, 
Switzerland, in April 2003, my mentor 
and friend from Burkina Faso, Joseph 
Ki-Zerbo [historian, politician and writer 
(1922-2006)], emphasized that “The main 
thing, then … is to bring to the top of the 
agenda and the planet’s social struggles, 
the concept, the question, the cause, the 
paradigm, of Ubuntu as an axiomatic and 
specific antidote to the mercantilism of 
humans and humankind by the partisan 
neo-liberalism of the market economy.”
In his lecture, “Ubuntu or ‘man as remedy 
for man’”, which was later published in 
the book, Repères pour l’Afrique, Panafrika 
(Silex/Nouvelles du Sud, Dakar, 2007), 
Ki-Zerbo continues his analysis by 
specifying that “…Ubuntu can be the 
most powerful tool for this paramount 
task. But, above all, it should become 
its goal and the meaning of peace. This 
does not mean moving towards a form 
of anthropological culturalism, but 
when confronted with the steam-roller 
of one-track thinking, it is has become 
urgent to disarm conflicts where the 
burden of responsibility is borne by the 
structural violence of the status quo …”
I am now convinced that, given the 
failure of current models of development, 
we have to think about how to design a 
new project for society, founded precisely 
on the concept of humanitude.
Why it is time to 
overhaul the CIPSH
The International Council for 
Philosophy and Human Sciences 
(CIPSH) is a non-governmental 
organization founded in Brussels, 
Belgium in 1949 under the 
auspices of UNESCO, with a view 
to reaffirming the meaning and 
challenges of the human sciences 
in the post-war period.
This learned society, affiliated to 
UNESCO, has had its moments of 
glory, but has become considerably 
diminished with the passage of time. 
The World Humanities Conference 
(WHC) provides an opportunity 
for the member organizations of 
CIPSH to encourage representatives 
of their respective disciplines to 
help re-establish the place of the 
human sciences in the world, and 
to undertake a veritable overhaul 
of the CIPSH. This will make it 
possible to replace the western-
centric viewpoint with a more 
fertile, polycentric approach, 
drawing on the world’s cultural 
and linguistic diversity.
The process of internal and external 
reorganization of the CIPSH is, 
fortunately, already underway. 
In December 2015, the CIPSH 
Extraordinary General Meeting 
in Beijing voted for a change in 
its statutes, allowing a range of 
organizations – including foundations 
and networks – to become members. 
The geographic base of the CIPSH 
has also been broadened, with 
the possibility of creating regional 
chapters. As a result, an Asia-Pacific 
CIPSH chapter was established in 
China in 2016. Lastly, the number of 
member organizations in the CIPSH 
has increased significantly, passing 
from twelve in 2014 to seventeen in 
2016, with two new memberships 
in the pipeline. 
The CIPSH is also creating new 
UNESCO Chairs in the humanities, 
who are attending the WHC.

Ideas
The major international meeting of 
the human sciences, the first World 
Humanities Conference (WHC), held in 
Liège, Belgium, from 6 to 12 August 2017, 
offers the opportunity to go deeper into 
this concept.
An unprecedented 
event 
The city of Liège, called the “Ardent 
City”, both in spirit and industry, is a 
multicultural city at the heart of Europe, 
and is hosting an unprecedented event, 
under the high patronage of the King 
of Belgium.
So why a World Humanities Conference? 
The idea came to me in 2009, during my 
first term as president of the International 
Council for Philosophy and Human 
Sciences (CIPSH), a non-governmental 
organization created under the auspices 
of UNESCO in 1949. 
It was a result of three observations. 
Following recurrent episodes of instability 
linked to financial globalization, the 
crisis of 2008-2009 became more than 
just financial or economic, turning into 
a “total” crisis. It was a crisis of society, 
which, in a way, confirmed the bankruptcy 
of the dominant neo-liberal and western-
centric model of development, leading to 
a real loss of meaning.
My second observation was the 
progressive marginalization of the 
human sciences in the world. How 
can one accept that, faced with such a 
strongly compelling situation, those with 
the responsibility to explain to us the 
complexity of the social transformations, 
should be paralyzed, unable to move?
Thirdly, I observed the lack of 
involvement, if not the total absence, 
or shunning, of scholars of the human 
sciences from outside Europe and the 
“West” in global intellectual production 
and co-operation. The situation was made 
worse by the risks of the disappearance 
of traditional knowledge and of half 
the world’s languages − which are 
now spoken of as epistemicides and 
linguicides.
This is why, in 2009, it appeared to me 
not only obvious, but also imperative, 
to propose that UNESCO organize a 
World Humanities Conference (WHC). 
The first attempt of its kind, its aim would 
be to start the process of rehabilitating 
the human sciences in the world. 
An unbearable anxiety
The central issue for the WHC is to discuss 
the role of the human sciences in a 
twenty-first century characterized by 
cultural diversity, the failure of various 
forms of one-track thinking, and a need 
to reintroduce medium- and long-term 
considerations into everyday reasoning. 
This is a century stricken by global 
changes, growing migration, social and 
economic stresses – the resolution of 
which largely depends on intercultural 
skills, on understanding the unity of 
humankind in all its diversity. It also 
depends on the need to reinforce 
the relationships of the sciences across 
disciplines and with the arts and 
technologies.
We have to promote a relationship 
with the world based on a search for 
non-conflictual relations and harmony 
with the environment, in order for humans 
to reconnect with one another again.

Ideas
This is a century which has started with 
the development of global terrorism 
that spares no region in the world, no 
country, striking as blindly as inhumanely, 
innocent citizens, who are victims of a 
gratuitous, barbaric and unutterable 
violence. An unbearable anxiety traverses 
the planet, all the more so because such 
acts of violence – known during the 
colonial conquests and wars of liberation 
− have remained relatively unknown 
to the cloistered West since the Second 
World War, with a few exceptions.
The main aim of the WHC is, therefore, to 
study ways in which the humanities are 
helping or can help, nationally, regionally 
and internationally, to measure and 
understand the cultural transformations 
linked to the gradual globalization of 
exchanges, in order to manage them 
better − in all their economic, social 
and environmental dimensions.
Faced with the social and human 
crisis that we are experiencing, and 
a broken world where the process of 
dehumanization is growing and gaining 
strength, the ambition of the WHC is to 
build a fertile dialogue between today’s 
minds about the challenges, the stakes 
and new knowledge, through which the 
humanities can render our world more 
legible, less opaque, less antagonistic, 
less murderous and at the same time 
– it’s our shared hope – more human. 
The humanities are a celebration of the 
genius of the languages of mankind 
and the knowledge arising from the 
proliferation of our social, political, 
economic and artistic practices.
Rehabilitating 
and rebuilding 
the human sciences
The title of the WHC, “Challenges and 
Responsibilities for a Planet in Transition”, 
clearly situates the issues underlying this 
conference. According to UNESCO, the 
major challenges of our planet in transition 
are: population growth; the recomposition 
of territories; migration flows; energy 
and environmental constraints; 
the homogenization of cultures in the 
context of globalization − and inversely, 
the construction of new identities; and 
the arrival of the digital age, which 
often creates a divided society.
“Our world is in the grips of a seemingly 
never-ending, multidimensional 
crisis,” says Adama Samassékou.

The three stages of the World Humanities 
Conference
The first World Humanities Conference (WHC), is held in Liège (Belgium) from 
6 to 12 August, 2017. It is jointly organized by UNESCO, the International 
Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences (CIPSH) and the World Humanities 
Conference Foundation (comprising the province, city and University of Liège).
The WHC brings together around 1,800 global participants, from the fields 
of science, politics, non-governmental organizations, the arts and the media. 
Major networks, including the Latin American Council of Social Sciences 
(CLACSO), the African Union African Academy of Languages (ACALAN) and 
the Arab Council for the Social Sciences (ACSS) will also be present. 
The overall structure of the WHC provides for linkages between upstream, 
ongoing, and downstream processes. This makes it possible to highlight and 
share the humanities from different regions of the world – in all their diversity 
and points of convergence.
■  Upstream of the WHC, a series of preparatory conferences were organized, 
allowing respective regions to make quality contributions to the world 
event – voicing their particular concerns and specificities. These included 
the South American Conference: “Territorialities and Humanities” in Brazil 
(4-7 October 2016); the Arab Regional Consultation, “Recentring Humanities: 
Theories, Approaches, Knowledge Production in the Arab region” in Lebanon 
(18-20 May 2017); and the African Regional Conference on Humanities, 
“Languages, Cultures, History and Territories” in Mali (28 June to 1 July 2017). 
The WHC also benefited from a number of contributing events: the 
International Conference on Science and Civilization on the Silk Road, in Beijing, 
(10-11 December 2015); the Taihu World Cultural Forum, “Civilization on the Silk 
Road” in Macao, China (7-9 June 2016); the 4th World Humanities Forum, devoted 
to “Humanities of Hope” in Suwon, Republic of Korea (27-29 October 2016); and, 
in June 2017, meetings in Paris (for Europe) and Kingston (for the Caribbean).
■  During the WHC (from 6 to 12 August 2017), plenary sessions are structured 
around six main themes, addressing the main challenges facing our planet in 
transition. These include: humans and the environment; cultural identities, 
cultural diversity, and intercultural relations; boundaries and migrations; 
cultural heritage – both tangible and intangible; history, memory and politics; 
and the humanities in a world in transition.
Four to six distinguished speakers from every continent are giving presentations 
on each of these themes.
A long series of sub-themes of the WHC are discussed in seventy symposia, 
grouped into eleven parallel sessions. 
Two plenary strategic sessions provide an opportunity to present reports 
from the regional conferences and discuss the future of the humanities and 
the International Council for Philosophy and Human Sciences (CIPSH).
Seven plenary conferences and a panel of ministers and political decision-makers 
are also included in the WHC programme, which brings together over 
400 speakers.
The discussions include two large projects that will involve the CIPSH in the 
future, namely the Global History of Humanity and the World Humanities Report.
■  Downstream of the WHC, regional and national conferences are organized on 
all continents, under the auspices of various regional political bodies of the world. 
This makes it possible to implement the conclusions and recommendations of 
the WHC. The emphasis is on public-sector research policies − especially the need 
for infrastructure and funding for research in the social sciences and humanities. 
This three-stage process makes this global event a high-level, inclusive and 
participatory platform for dialogue. This helps foster greater synergy between 
those who think, seek and find solutions to lift the world out of crises, and those 
who are responsible for policy decisions. 
There is a feeling that the prevalent 
development models have failed, 
especially the neo-liberal model that 
seems to be imposing itself on the 
peoples of the world. In this context, 
it becomes imperative to reconsider the 
role of the human sciences within our 
contemporary societies. It needs to take 
into account both the specificities and 
the resources inherent in each culture, 
valuing them wisely, and the possibilities 
for exchange, for dialogue and mutual 
enrichment between them.
The WHC is therefore an opportunity 
to step back to rehabilitate and rebuild 
the human sciences, to produce a 
paradigm shift, enabling the reinvention 
of a world founded upon respect for 
its rich cultural and linguistic diversity. 
This new paradigm will enable us to 
substitute the conflictual relationships 
of competition with a genuine, universal 
solidarity, which is the only way to 
help meet the challenges of our planet 
in transition!
In short, we have to quench this planet’s 
thirst for humanity by living and 
consecrating our humanitude!
Adama Samassékou (Mali) is president 
of the World Humanities Conference 
(WCH). A former minister of national 
education in Mali, he chaired the 
preparatory committee of the World 
Summit on the Information Society 
(Geneva 2002-2003). Samassékou was 
also the first executive secretary of 
the African Union African Academy of 
Languages (ACALAN), based in Bamako. 
After two terms as president of the 
International Council for Philosophy and 
Human Sciences (CIPSH), from November 
2008 to October 2014, he is currently 
its honorary president.

Ideas
Since humans have been able, they 
have sought to understand life in all 
its dimensions, and the world they live 
in. They have used not just language, 
literature, philosophy, education, religion, 
arts, history, anthropology, archaeology 
and sociology, but also economics, 
psychology, media, development, 
sports, gender, finance, marketing, 
political science, environmental studies, 
communication studies, cultural studies 
and law, to interpret and record the world 
around them. Some of these disciplines 
are classified as social sciences because 
of the need for scientific validity, but 
I believe they play a part in the study 
of the humanities as well. 
Using language, human beings have 
produced and privileged their own 
narratives over the narratives derived 
from other regions.  
All civilizations take seriously the 
narratives embodying their cultures, 
knowledge systems and the modes of 
being they create. 
Three events have had a significant 
effect on the place the humanities have 
come to occupy in Western academy 
− the scientific revolution, the industrial 
revolution, and logicism [the modern 
school of mathematical thought, 
founded by German philosopher 
and mathematician Friedrich Ludwig 
Gottlob Frege (1884-1925)]. 
The scientific and industrial revolutions 
have combined to breed logical 
positivism and the conviction that 
all pursuit of knowledge must use 
scientific methodology or lose its validity 
and relevance.
The consequences of this have been 
damning for the intellectual heritages of 
non-European societies – they have often 
been described as primitive, uncivilized, 
pagan and backward. This has allowed 
for the economic appropriation of all 
the resources of these societies through 
colonialism and the enslavement of 
the peoples of Africa. 
Supplanting narratives
The worst scholarship has been the 
approximation of the narratives of Europe 
(and Arabia) to universal truths, and the 
consequent supplanting and substitution 
of the narratives of indigenous societies 
globally by those narratives. This accounts 
for the fact that Africans know little about 
their own ancestors. They use the names, 
languages, the religions, science and 
technologies of others, forgetting − even 
at times, hating − their own indigenous 
knowledge systems, traditions of being, 
values and ethos, and getting lost in 
the world of others.
The importance of
 homegrown
stories
by John Ayotunde Isola Bewaji
The emphasis on bread-and-
butter subjects like science, 
math and technology at 
the expense of the study of 
the humanities, is threatening 
the ability of the people of 
Jamaica and the Caribbean 
to appreciate and tell 
their own stories.

Ideas
A number of issues arise here. Firstly, 
industrialization has led to globalization 
of all forms of realities. Globalization is 
inevitable, but it does not prevent the 
peoples of the Caribbean from using their 
African heritage to make meaning of, and 
find paths to civilized existence. It is not 
necessary to fight globalization, but it can 
be enriched, using the historical cultures 
of one’s ancestry.
Secondly, the advocacy for a Science, 
Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) education creates 
a distorted imperative that other 
disciplines, which apparently do not 
provide direct practical benefits to 
society, are of little use. In Jamaica and 
in the West Indies, the emphasis has been 
on science, technology and the social 
sciences at the primary, secondary and 
tertiary education levels. Subjects such 
as fine arts, music, ethics, history, culture 
and heritage are minimized or removed 
from all levels of education, because 
they are not valued as contributors to 
human development. 
At the University of the West Indies 
(UWI), this emphasis on the sciences 
has resulted in the Humanities and 
Education Faculty consistently attracting 
less than twenty-five per cent of the 
entire student population, because 
their contributions to national and 
regional development are undervalued. 
The Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, 
has written editorials advocating 
the defunding of disciplines including 
history, the languages, philosophy and 
the arts by the government. Instead, 
it has suggested concentrating on those 
disciplines that would enable Jamaica 
and the region to catch up with the first 
world technologically. The newspaper 
erroneously argues that you do not need 
to know yourself, your realities, your 
society or your ancestry, and that once 
you attain technological parity with 
the West, everything will be fine.
The third issue relates to the declining 
financial fortunes at the national, 
regional and individual levels. Education, 
especially related to the humanities, 
easily gets short-changed when societies 
go through structural adjustments. 
Families and individuals prefer to invest 
in disciplines which are “marketable, 
productive and profile-enhancing”. 
The same applies to countries that 
believe that emphasis should be placed 
on science, engineering, medical 
and technology education, as these 
disciplines are thought to lead to a higher 
productive capacity.

Ideas
Identities and heritage
The study of the humanities is critical to 
the identity appreciation, configuration 
and projection of a society. When a society 
neglects the understanding, appreciation 
and propagation of the humanities, 
it is open to various forms of abuse, 
the degradation of its heritage and the 
appropriation of its essence. The infliction 
of epistemicide [the killing of knowledge 
systems or the destruction of existing 
knowledge] on the African people in the 
form of “empty baggage syndrome” has 
led to the dispossession of Africans in the 
new world, of their identities and heritage, 
leading to a confused, disoriented and 
dislocated people. 
The rampant violence and incivility in 
Jamaican society is partly a manifestation 
of this. Even while Jamaica has always 
punched above its weight category in all 
walks of life, there persists a preference 
for things Euro-western.
The thinking at the UWI has been a victim 
of the historical circumstances chronicled 
by Jamaican author and educator Errol 
Miller, who writes about the dependency 
of the regional economies after the 
abolition of slavery and emancipation. 
This is why it has not been able to pursue 
wholesome educational paradigms, 
designed to teach the humanities, without 
having to worry about the immediately 
discernible benefits of such teaching. 
UNESCO has continued to lead in 
the development of a more humane 
world, where reason, reflection and 
diversity are valued. However, with the 
resistance to reparation payments to 
the people who have suffered the worst 
form of inhumanity in human history, 
through the horrors of Atlantic slavery, 
it is understandable that countries of 
the Caribbean region are mendicant − 
incapable of taking decisions which will 
uplift their citizens from penury. 
This probably explains why Jamaica 
has one of the highest homicide rates 
in the world, in spite of being the

The university needs a full-fledged 
department or school of philosophical 
studies, which would aid critical thinking 
in the study of many other subjects, 
including business, tourism, conflict 
resolution and the environment. 
It is important that the humanities are 
taught at the primary, secondary and 
post-secondary educational institutions 
in Jamaica and the region, because 
the building blocks of peace take place 
in the minds of people. Cultural and 
musical genres of Jamaican origin have 
transcended the shores of Jamaica and 
influenced the entire world, but little 
has been done to teach and develop 
these traditions among Jamaican youth. 
This knowledge could be used to impact 
the creativity of Jamaicans and empower 
them economically.
Finally, it is important to understand 
that the humanities are the foundation 
of everything in knowledge generation 
− its curation, storage, retrieval, 
dissemination and utilization. Rich and 
powerful countries do not leave 
the education of its citizens to others. 
Similarly, weak and poor societies must 
appreciate the need to ensure that their 
own stories are homegrown and delivered 
to society in a wholesome manner that 
is conducive to our collective humanity 
− even in our beautiful diversity.
John Ayotunde Isola Bewaji 
(Jamaican born in Nigeria) is the author 
of several books, including The Rule 
of Law and Governance in Indigenous 
Yoruba Society: A Study in African 
Philosophy of Law. He has been an

Caribbean Journal of Philosophy (CJP).

Elsewhere in the world, in African cultures 
for example, there is an equivalent to 
this learning of “the” classics. This is the 
moment of initiation, when young girls 
and boys receive the transmission of 
the heritage of ancient times, enabling 
them to live in present times. These are 
the times of the humanities. 
Every age, every culture has its classics, 
its essential texts. And, among these, 
poetry has always occupied pride of 
place. Always, that is, until now. In our 
disenchanted world, we have a tendency 
to forget that poetry exists. I would like to 
elaborate on this, precisely to challenge 
this oversight and show that poetry is 
an integral part of the humanities.
What poetry can do
No society exists without poets. Even 
if the act of creating is performed in 
solitude, poets do not live in a bubble. 
They are not hermits, shut away in ivory 
towers, but creators of a universe which 
they offer us to share. Whether their 
poetry is written down or sung, poets 
play a very important educational role. 
The philosophers of ancient Greece 
did not fail to notice this. In their eyes, 
poetry was the embodiment of an 
experience of learning, a general culture 
that preceded all specialized scientific 
or political learning.  
They knew to what extent learning 
Homer and other poets was important 
for shaping the minds of young free 
Greeks (those who were neither slaves nor 
metics). This is why Plato, in The Republic, 
was worried that Homer painted a bad 
image of the gods in his poems and ended 
up banishing poets from his city-state!
Plato’s reproach of Homer was no doubt 
as much a matter of what poetry is, 
as what it cannot be.
But, then or now, who can say what 
poetry is? For the Argentinian writer 
Jorge Luis Borges, a definition of poetry 
as “the expression of the beautiful 
through the medium of words artfully 
woven together” might be good enough 
for a dictionary, but remains rather 
“feeble”. “These realities are so deep 
within us,” he adds, “that they can only 
be expressed through the symbols that 
all men share.”
by Tanella Boni
Poetry, like any other form of artistic creation, is one of the pillars of 
the humanities. By following the paths of emotion, sensitivity and 
the imagination, the poem transmits knowledge and human values. 
Better still, it shapes the human being, body and soul.
The poet 
at the heart of society
Art does not reason. It belongs to the 
realm of emotions, of sensibilities and 
imagination. The artistic experience 
cannot be subjected to argument, 
verification or proof, as it is not a form 
of scientific knowledge. And yet, in its 
own way, away from the well-trodden 
tracks of the sciences, art plays a 
primordial role in shaping the individual. 
It transmits the human values and 
worldly knowledge that are essential for 
opening ourselves to the Other. Artistic 
creation, therefore, forges very strong 
links between humans − transcending 
beyond languages, beliefs and cultures. 
This is why art can be considered one of 
the pillars of the humanities.
The times of 
the humanities
The humanities are still very present in 
the English-speaking world − covering 
the disciplines of literature, linguistics, 
philosophy, history and art − in which 
openness of the mind and human life 
are emphasized within society.
In several French-speaking countries, 
though, the term has fallen into disuse, 
or almost, except in some academic 
circles. Yet there was a time in the French 
educational system, when one “did the 
humanities”. That meant learning “its” 
classics, studying ancient languages, 
reading Homer, Virgil and other classical 
authors − acquiring as broad a vision as 
possible by studying the ways of being, 
of living, and of speaking of human 
beings from other civilizations.

Shared in 
a sensitive way
Poetry is made to be shared in a sensitive 
way. That is how it shapes the human 
being, body and soul. By following the 
paths of emotion, of sensitivity and 
of the imagination, it is a vehicle for 
transmitting human knowledge and 
values − a sense of good and evil, history, 
the great deeds of men and women, 
ancient traditions, and links with nature. 
If this knowledge is an awakening 
of the senses by creating beauty in 
language and words, it is also the 
cultivation of imagination and memory. 
It is a performance of the body and all of 
its faculties. Because the form – of what 
is spoken or written – counts as much as 
the meaning or the “message”.
As the French poet and philosopher, 
Paul Valéry (1871-1945) says in his book, 
Ego Scriptor: “The goal of the poet is not 
to communicate a thought, but to give 
birth to an emotional state in the other 
which is similar (but not identical) to his 
own. The idea only plays a partial role (in 
himself and the other).”
Confronted with the realities of an 
incomprehensible world in which he 
finds himself “embedded”, the poet never 
ceases to “create dangerously”, in the 
words of the French writer, Albert Camus 
(1913-1960), in his essay, “The Artist 
and his Time” (Uppsala, Sweden, 
14 December 1957). It is by creating 
dangerously, to protect life against 
threats from all sides, or to express the 
joy of being in the world, that the poet 
regains his place − at the heart of society.
This portrait of Mahmoud Darwich 
(1941-2008) by French visual artist 
Ernest Pignon-Ernest, adorned 
the walls of Ramallah in 2009, where 
the Palestinian poet was living. 
His “alarm-bell words will never 
cease to resonate, inspire, mobilise 
and keep us on the alert,” insists 
French writer André Velter.

Our guest
When UNESCO awarded you the 
Félix Houphouët-Boigny Peace Prize 
in April 2017, you accepted it as a 
“homage to the memory of the countless 
victims of the traffic in human beings 
in the Mediterranean”. What did you 
mean by that?
I think it is both honest and right to 
dedicate this prize to the migrants 
who have lost their lives crossing the 
Mediterranean, because the human 
tragedy we are witnessing in the region 
is really a silent war. Theirs is a forced 
journey − forced by war and poverty, 
forced by our politics, and by the 
organized criminals who are profiting 
from their predicament. Faced with 
closed doors, the traffickers are offering 
these desperate people the only possible 
way out.
Even now, new walls are being built and 
new agreements signed with a number of 
North African countries, with the sole aim 
of protecting European borders and not 
the lives of those who are trying to reach 
our shores. In contrast, this prize shows us 
that there is solidarity in Europe; that the 
values of humanity and hospitality have 
not been lost.
Yet, faced with this influx of migrants, 
many are talking of an “invasion”…
It is natural for an island to be welcoming, 
as I’ve said before. This is essentially what 
the island of Lesbos has done in Greece. 
Perhaps it’s because of our geographical 
position – the migration route passes 
through Lampedusa. Although, to be 
more accurate, it might be the other way 
round – it’s because our island lies half-
way that the route is possible. 
I don’t know what other people would 
do if they found themselves here, at 
this historic moment where so many 
people are fleeing. Anyone who suggests 
“pushing them back” is simply living too 
far away, and doesn’t understand the 
law of the sea – pushing them back is 
impossible. Witnessing the situation first 
hand, helps us understand and awakens 
our sense of responsibility. Here, we see 
them arriving – human beings who are 
exhausted, cold, barefoot, terrorized. 
We see children, and pregnant women. 
And one can see straightaway that they 
have made this journey because they had 
no other choice. In any case, it’s the only 
thing we can do, given the position that 
geography and history have assigned us. 
We have to welcome them.
In Lampedusa, we have experienced 
some very painful moments. Faced with 
a tragedy like the shipwreck of 3 October 
2013, when 386 people lost their lives, who 
can we blame? The dead? At moments like 
these, you can see clearly who the victims 
are, and which the unjust deaths are. 
This is not the first time that Lampedusa 
has lived through difficult times … 
No, we experienced very hard times in 
2011, when the events in Tunisia caused 
many people to flee. The Minister of 
Foreign Affairs at the time, Roberto 
Maroni, decided to leave all the migrants 
on Lampedusa – they couldn’t go to 
Italy, he told us. So we had to repatriate 
them directly from here. But repatriation 
procedures take time and, in two months, 
25,000 people arrived here, which is four 
times the number of inhabitants! 
How did the island’s residents react?
Our reception facilities were 
overwhelmed. The migrants were living 
in inhumane conditions, on the streets, 
in the cold. It was a false emergency, 
because 25,000 is nothing compared 
to what we’re seeing today. If they had 
all been distributed across the Italian 
mainland, their numbers would have 
remained manageable. But leaving 
them on Lampedusa created a crisis. 
That year, the island suffered heavy 
losses. Lampedusa’s economy depends 
on tourism, which collapsed completely. 
But even then, in those conditions, 
there was a show of solidarity. The 
Lampedusani tried to help, by handing 
out blankets and food. The people took 
over from the state. If there were any 
protests, they were directed against the 
Italian government, not the Tunisians. 
It’s natural for an island to be 
welcoming!
Giuseppina Nicolini
As Mayor of Lampedusa (from 2012 to June 2017), Giuseppina Nicolini 
bravely tackled one of the most dramatic crises to have affected 
the Mediterranean Basin in recent years – the arrival of thousands 
of migrants fleeing conflict and poverty. She explains how the 
6,500 inhabitants of this little Italian island south of Sicily have reacted 
to this humanitarian disaster with a show of solidarity and respect for 
human dignity. A meeting with the woman the Italians call “The Lioness”.

The former Italian Prime Minister, Enrico 
Letta, went down on his knees before the 
white coffins of children. And the Italian 
government launched Mare Nostrum, the 
first official humanitarian operation to 
honour our country. This operation lasted 
a year. It was very costly and Italy asked 
its European partners for help.
But there was general opposition. Mare 
Nostrum was accused of exactly the same 
wrongs as the NGOs today – of being an 
element of attraction, even complicity, 
in the trafficking of human beings. Other 
humanitarian operations were to follow, 
such as Frontex and Triton, but their goals 
were more concerned with security and 
to detect and combat crime. 
Then, in the second half of 2016, 
all the programmes came to a halt, 
including interventions by some 
European countries who were part of 
Frontex. Italy found itself alone once 
again, with its navy and coast-guard 
vessels. We were back to where we were 
before Mare Nostrum. As the death toll 
continued to rise, the NGOs filled this 
institutional vacuum. 
Besides being very involved with civil 
society, you are also a committed 
ecologist, opposed among other things, 
to property speculation. What led you to 
stand for mayor at such a difficult time?
These struggles triggered a democratic 
movement made up of forces within civil 
society, which asked me to stand as a 
candidate with a manifesto against the 
social and environmental degradation 
from which our island was suffering. 
Lampedusa found itself pushed aside, 
both geographically and socially, with 
deteriorating schools and youth who 
had no choice but to leave.
We have worked hard and there is 
still a lot to do, but the islands in the 
archipelago have learned how to live 
again. We have invested in public 
transport, recycling, solar energy and 
schools. Earlier, we only had a college for 
the sciences; now we also have a hotel 
and tourism institute.

During a serious economic crisis, it is 
all too easy to mark out migrants as the 
common enemy. It’s also a diversion 
to mask the political responsibilities of 
those who support an inequitable model 
of development − creating inequalities 
in a context made more complex by 
globalization. History has taught us 
that pointing a finger at an outside 
enemy also strengthens internal political 
authority, while surely not promoting the 
development of a civic conscience, or a 
sense of belonging to a community.
Today, NGOs are being accused of playing 
a role in attracting migrants...
Indeed, and this also the case for the 
French NGO, SOS Méditerranée, with 
which I have the honour of sharing the 
Félix Houphouët-Boigny Prize. But those 
who accuse these organizations are 
forgetting that they have arrived here 
to fill a vacuum. 
After the tragedy of 3 October 2013, 
we have witnessed other disasters, 
some of them even worse. In April 2015, 
between 500 and 700 people lost their 
lives when a single ship sank. In 2013, 
some European politicians came here 
and were visibly moved.

Askavusa, a collective started in 
Lampedusa in March 2009, has created 
a permanent exhibition space, PortoM, 
to display everyday objects found 
on the boats of migrants.
Admired for her courage and humanity, 
Giuseppina Nicolini was born in 
Lampedusa, Italy. A militant ecologist, 
she was responsible for getting Rabbit 
Beach, an island next to Lampedusa, 
declared a nature reserve in 1997. She 
was mayor of Lampedusa from May 
2012 to June 2017, and fought hard to 
get the Italian and European authorities 
to act in response to the migrant crisis. 
In 2016, she received the Simone de 
Beauvoir Prize for Women’s Freedom 
in recognition of her efforts.
I am convinced that the future of an 
island like Lampedusa is linked to the 
geopolitical destiny of the Mediterranean. 
We want this sea to be transformed into 
a centre for exchanges, both political and 
cultural. But before we get there, we have 
to stop using territories as prisons for 
migrants, which is what Lampedusa 
almost became. 
We must cultivate the tradition of 
welcome in its purest form, with islands 
serving as landing stages and first-aid 
points for migrants, who are then 
transferred to a second reception centre, 
free from any logic of emergency. Then, 
as we have noted, migration and tourism 
can co-exist and the island can prosper. 
I sincerely hope that the prize 
that UNESCO has awarded to SOS 
Méditerranée and to me, will encourage 
other initiatives. Our example 
demonstrates the great strength 
of small territories. 
Nineteen thousand 
people rescued 
in fifteen months
“We’re very happy to be given this 
award together with Giusi Nicolini,” 
said Sophie Beau, co-founder and 
vice-president of SOS Méditerranée, 
as she received the Félix Houphouët-
Boigny Prize. “We visited her in 
Lampedusa when we founded our 
association in 2015, to explain our 
project to start rescue activities 
with a ship chartered by European 
citizens. She declared to Klaus Vogel, 
our co-founder: ‘You are crazy, but 
I’m with you.’”
“We can’t just look on and do 
nothing as thousands of people 
drown in the sea right in front of 
us, at the gates to Europe,” Beau 
exclaims. This was the conclusion 
that led Vogel, a German merchant 
captain, and Beau, a humanitarian 
programme specialist, to set up 
SOS Méditerranée, a European 
non-governmental organization 
(NGO) for high-sea rescue.
The NGO’s field of action is the 
Mediterranean, which thousands of 
migrants and refugees fleeing war and 
famine try crossing to reach the shores 
of Europe, risking their lives in the 
attempt. At least 46,000 people have 
died at sea in the past fifteen years.
The NGO is founded on the 
traditional values of mutual aid 
between seafarers, and works in 
close collaboration with the Italian 
authorities – the Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centre of Rome.
The nerve centre of the initiative 
is Aquarius, a 77-metre ship, 
operated by a crew of eleven, with 
a medical team from Médecins sans 
Frontières and a rescue team from 
SOS Méditerranée. In total, thirty 
people are always ready to cope 
with a capacity of 500 passengers, 
sometimes more. 
In fifteen months of operations off 
the coast of Libya (from February 
2016 to May 2017), the association 
has rescued over 19,000 people. 
Most of the survivors come from 
sub-Saharan Africa, especially West 
Africa and the Horn of Africa, but 
also from Bangladesh, Syria, Libya, 
Pakistan and Palestine.

Current affairs
It is nearly sixteen years since the 
journalist, playwright and author, 
Dawit Isaak, was imprisoned without 
trial in his native Eritrea. Isaak, who was 
awarded the 2017 UNESCO/Guillermo 
Cano World Press Freedom Prize, has 
become a household name in Sweden 
(of which he is a citizen and where his 
three children and other family members 
currently reside). A portrait of Isaak 
from the late 1980s has become an 
international symbol in the fight for press 
freedom and the freedom of expression. 
Isaak has been named a prisoner of 
conscience by Amnesty International, 
which has called for his immediate and 
unconditional release. 
Over the years, diplomatic initiatives 
by five administrations of his adopted 
country, international lobbying 
campaigns, civil-society efforts and 
celebrity-studded drives, have helped 
keep Isaak’s case in the spotlight. But the 
Eritrean regime has neither heeded calls 
to grant his release nor offered him a fair 
trial or any contact with the outside world, 
apart from a brief release from jail in 2005.
Born on 27 October 1964, in the early 
years of the thirty-year Eritrean War 
of Independence [September 1961 to 
May 1991], Isaak grew up in Asmara. 
His parents ran a small Italian deli, and 
he was one of five siblings. 
When Isaak was in his twenties, the 
fighting between the Eritrean People’s 
Liberation Front and the Ethiopian 
army intensified, and the Soviet Union 
withdrew its support of the Ethiopian 
government. Isaak fled the country for 
Sweden in 1987, where he first made 
a living as a cleaner.
Committed to democracy
Isaak stayed committed to fighting for 
a free and democratic Eritrea, according 
to his younger brother, Esayas Isaak. 
“I have few early childhood memories 
of Dawit since he is 10 years older than 
me, but when I was a teenager, he was 
my Tigrinya language teacher here in 
Sweden. He used to tell me over and over: 
‘Don’t forget your language, your country, 
your roots.’  
by Nathalie Rothschild
Dawit Isaak has become an 
international symbol in the 
fight for press freedom. He was 
awarded the 2017 UNESCO/
Guillermo Cano World Press 
Freedom Prize, which his family 
says has served to rekindle the 
hope that he will be freed soon.

Current affairs
Free-flowing information
“We wanted our newspaper to flow 
like a river without interruption,” Aaron 
Berhane, who co-founded Setit with Isaak, 
explained. 
Isaak became part-owner of Setit and 
was a prolific columnist, covering culture 
and local affairs. But it did not take long 
before fresh clashes broke out between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea, and Isaak was 
forced to leave for Sweden – his wife 
and children soon joined him. Though 
the political situation remained unstable 
in Eritrea in 2001, Isaak decided to 
return home. He stepped straight into a 
dangerous controversy, as Setit published 
an open letter to the Eritrean president. 
A few months later, all independent 
newspapers were banned – eleven of the 
letter’s signatories (which included top 
politicians) and ten journalists, including 
Isaak, were jailed. 
The arrests took place just weeks after 
the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in the United 
States. “The world has totally changed 
since then. He [Dawit] has missed out 
on so much,” Esayas said. “There are 
times when I feel like he is about to be 
forgotten, that there is a sense of fatigue 
around the efforts to free him. But then, 
other times, I feel like something just 
must happen. 
 “I also have a sense of renewed hope, 
now that my brother has been awarded 
UNESCO’s World Press Freedom Prize, 
which brings attention to his case at 
the United Nations level,” he added.
“I believe this award sends an important 
and significant signal against the 
treatment that Dawit Isaak has been 
subjected to,” said Cilla Benkö, Director-
General and CEO of Swedish Radio and 
president of the 2017 UNESCO World 
Press Freedom Prize jury. “He has been 
imprisoned without any contact with 
his near and dear ones and with no trial. 
It is a completely unacceptable state of 
affairs,” Benkö stressed. 
Renewed hope
Days before the UNESCO World Press 
Freedom Prize awards ceremony in 
Jakarta, Indonesia, which coincided with 
World Press Freedom Day on 3 May 2017, 
the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples’ Rights announced that it would 
take up Isaak’s case.

“Culture and identity were important 
to him. At the same time, he respected 
Swedish society and did adjust to life 
here,” Esayas said.
In 1993, a year after obtaining Swedish 
citizenship, Isaak returned to a newly 
independent Eritrea, where he married 
and had three children – twin brother 
and sister, Yorun and Betlehem, and their 
sister Danait, who is 4 years younger. 
“One of my earliest memories of my 
father is him teaching me and my brother 
to read, and from the age of 4, he taught 
us math,” says Betlehem Isaak, who is 
now 23 years old. “He was keen for us to 
learn about our history and the world 
around us, though he wasn’t always very 
pedagogic! But he tried his best. He was 
a very committed parent.”
By the late 1990s, efforts to liberalize 
Eritrean society seemed to have paid 
off. The country issued a new law that 
permitted the private ownership of 
print media – a freedom Isaak took 
advantage of by co-founding Eritrea’s first 
independent newspaper, Setit, named 
after the only river in Eritrea that flows 
all year round.

Current affairs
The move comes after Isaak’s lawyers 
submitted a petition to the Commission, 
based on the principle of habeas 
corpus – a court order that commands 
an individual or a government who 
has restrained another to produce 
the prisoner and justify the prisoner’s 
detention. While the Eritrean authorities 
have accepted this principle, they have 
refused the right to a trial to Isaak and 
the other journalists detained since 
September 2001.
The Commission has said it will question 
Eritrea about the country’s failure to 
comply with international human rights 
conventions; a vow that stirred renewed 
hope for Isaak’s family. But Betlehem 
dares only to be cautiously optimistic. 
“It means something, but whether or not 
it will have any impact is still up to Eritrea. 
They have the power to decide over 
my father’s fate,” she said.
Esayas has called the move a “positive 
development”. “It does send a signal 
to the international community and to 
the Eritrean state, which has committed 
severe assaults on my brother for 
nearly sixteen years now. I only hope 
those in power are listening and will 
do something.
Quiet diplomacy
“It took a while for Swedish officials, 
media and civil society to start paying 
attention to my brother’s case”, Esayas 
said. But eventually, the government at 
the time engaged in “quiet diplomacy” 
with Eritrea for his release. A brief 
ray of hope when Isaak was released 
in November 2005, was quickly 
extinguished as he was detained again 
two days later, on his way to a hospital. 
The “Sit with Dawit” event was launched 
by the “Free Dawit” campaign in 2016, 
to create engagement in the Isaak case. 
A mock-up of Dawit’s cell was installed on 
a number of sites and individuals asked to 
spend fifteen minutes sitting alone in the 
dark cell – to reflect upon Dawit’s nearly 
sixteen years of solitary confinement must 
feel like, and show solidarity with him. 
This photograph was taken on the 
5,000th day of Dawit’s detention, on one 
of Stockholm’s main squares. 
Hope was rekindled a few years later, 
when a former prison guard who had 
fled Eritrea told Swedish media that Isaak 
was alive, but unwell and being held in 
inhumane conditions. Isaak is thought to 
have spent much of the last sixteen years 
in solitary confinement, alone in a dark 
prison cell. 
Isaak’s story demonstrates that “we need 
journalists who hold those in power to 
account but that, unfortunately, doing so 
is also increasingly associated with great 
danger,” Benkö said.
“We should be grateful that there are 
people out there who are willing to 
take risks in order to offer the rest of us 
descriptions of reality that we otherwise 
would not have access to. Dawit is an 
example of such a person and there are 
journalists around the world who offer 
important guarantees that freedom of 
expression is upheld…. I am proud that 
the jury I preside over was unanimous 
in its decision to award Dawit Isaak 
the UNESCO World Press Freedom Prize. 
This prize will contribute to putting 
pressure on those who are keeping Isaak 
imprisoned,” Benkö added.

Global destruction of cultural heritage, 
now occurring at an unprecedented scale, 
brings into focus the question of whether 
or not to reconstruct significant places as 
a means of recovering their meaning. 
The 2001 demolition of the ancient 
Buddha statues in Bamiyan Valley in 
Afghanistan foreshadowed a wave of 
deliberate desecration of the world’s 
iconic cultural sites, including Palmyra 
and Aleppo in Syria.  
UNESCO calls these attacks on World 
Heritage Sites a form of cultural cleansing, 
which require new national and 
international policies and the involvement 
of the United Nations, Interpol and 
the International Criminal Court. 
In addition, natural disasters are 
destroying swathes of buildings, as we 
have seen during the 2015 earthquake 
in the Kathmandu valley, Nepal, where 
hundreds of structures within the World 
Heritage Site have been affected. 
Reconstruction: 
changing attitudes
by Christina Cameron
Natural disasters and an 
increase in terrorist attacks 
have meant that the world’s 
cultural heritage has suffered 
heavier losses in recent 
years. This has led to a more 
favourable attitude by the 
World Heritage Committee 
and UNESCO towards 
the reconstruction of damaged 
or destroyed sites, in the face 
of traditional opposition. 
With this article, the UNESCO Courier 
marks the occasion of the 41st session 
of the World Heritage Committee, 
held in Krakow, Poland in July 2017.

Current affairs
Reconstruction is not new. Its roots 
can be found in nineteenth-century 
Western cultures, when the concept 
of historical monuments was created 
and consciousness of a historical 
past was developed, due to the rapid 
industrialization of society and its 
subsequent rupture with the past. 
Architects sought to replace missing 
parts of historic monuments as a means 
of restoring them to their previous 
splendour. French Gothic Revival 
architect and theorist Eugène Emmanuel 
Viollet-le-Duc’s reconstruction of the 
walls of the historic fortified city of 
Carcassonne, France, is a case in point. 
In the twentieth century, this trend was 
particularly strong in North America, 
where historical replicas served as living 
history museums, popular with visitors 
and effective as forms of presentation 
and interpretation of the past. 
The most famous example of this can be 
found in colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, 
where 350 buildings were reconstructed 
in the 1930s, and others from later 
periods were destroyed in an attempt 
to create an interpretative park to 
eighteenth-century colonial America. 
One can even argue that the 1972 World 
Heritage Convention originated in a 
UNESCO project: the dismantling and 
reconstruction of Nubian monuments 
from Abu Simbel to Philae in Egypt. This 
outstanding archaeological area, which 
was to be flooded by the Aswan Dam, 
was the site 3,000-year-old monuments 
and temples. These treasures were saved 
due to an unprecedented twenty-year 
international campaign launched by 
UNESCO, from 1960 to 1980. 
Honesty and 
transparency 
The question remains: to construct 
or not to reconstruct. Heritage 
conservation professionals have 
traditionally been opposed to 
reconstruction because this approach 
can falsify history and create fictional 
places that never existed in that form. 
This opposition began in the nineteenth 
century and gathered momentum 
following the oft-repeated guidance from 
French art historian and archaeologist 
Adolphe Napoléon Didron that “for 
ancient monuments, it is better to 
consolidate than repair, better to repair 
than to restore, better to restore than 
to reconstruct”. 
In 1883, in the Prima Carta del Restauro, 
Italian architect Camillo Boito spelled out 
eight principles for heritage conservation 
that insist on honesty and transparency 
when adding missing parts to buildings. 
These ideas eventually found expression 
in the key twentieth-century doctrinal 
text that is the foundation of the 
International Council on Monuments and 
Sites (ICOMOS). The 1964 International 
Charter on the Conservation and 
Restoration of Monuments and Sites, 
known as the Venice Charter, rules out 
reconstruction and insists that restoration 
must stop where conjecture begins. 
Subsequent standards and guidelines 
have consistently expressed caution 
about reconstructing historic sites. 
There are exceptions – the Australia 
ICOMOS Charter for the Conservation of 
Places of Cultural Significance, known 
as the Burra Charter, adopted in 1979, 
accepts reconstruction if it reflects a 
pattern of use or cultural practice that 
sustains cultural value. But even here, a 
“cautious approach to changing a place” 
is advocated. 
Shifting attitude 
In the early years, UNESCO’s World 
Heritage Committee (WHC) followed 
the ICOMOS doctrine and generally 
opposed reconstructions. An exception 
was made in 1980 for the historic city 
of Warsaw, whose massive rebuilding 
was seen as a symbol of the patriotic 
feeling of the Polish people. Until 
recently, the Committee has remained 
largely unsympathetic to reconstructed 
sites, although there have been 
other exceptions.
The Genbaku Dome of the Hiroshima 
Peace Memorial, Japan, preserved 
in exactly the same state it was found, 
after being hit by the first atomic bomb 
on 6 August 1945.

Current affairs
For example, the listing of the Old Bridge 
Area of the Old City of Mostar in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, in 2005, was justified 
on the basis of the restoration of cultural 
value, an intangible dimension of the 
property. In the case of the Tombs of 
Buganda Kings at Kasubi, Uganda, which 
were destroyed by fire in 2010, the 
Committee gave provisional approval 
for reconstruction, on condition that 
the new structure was based on sound 
documentation, traditional forms and 
techniques and continuing use. Indeed, 
the current version of the World Heritage 
Committee’s Operational Guidelines for 
the Implementation of the World Heritage 
Convention still echoes the Venice Charter 
when it states: “In relation to authenticity, 
the reconstruction of archaeological 
remains or historic buildings or districts 
is justifiable only in exceptional 
circumstances. Reconstruction is 
acceptable only on the basis of complete 
and detailed documentation and to 
no extent on conjecture.”
Yet, in light of recent attacks by 
extremists on heritage places, decisions 
of the World Heritage Committee and 
UNESCO reflect a shifting attitude toward 
reconstruction. The justification for this 
shift is based in part on the ideas in the 
Nara Document on Authenticity (which 
was “conceived in the spirit of the Charter 
of Venice” in 1994, and adopted by 
ICOMOS) in which the broadened use of 
intangible attributes makes a stronger 
case for reconstruction. 
The beginning of this shift can be marked 
by the wilful destruction in 2012 of the 
Sufi mausoleums at the Timbuktu World 
Heritage Site in Mali. Defying appeals 
from the Director-General of UNESCO and 
the WHC to spare these revered tombs, 
extremists attacked them with renewed 
vengeance until fourteen mausoleums 
were destroyed.  
Since that time, UNESCO has 
spearheaded a reconstruction process, 
which was completed in record time in 
2015. This is a good example when trying 
to answer the question of “reconstruction: 
for or against?”. It is worth noting that 
the values listed in the Statement of 
Outstanding Universal Value focus on 
the tombs as witness to Timbuktu’s 
past, with no mention of community 
values or architectural techniques. It was 
only after the destruction of the tombs 
that community and intangible values 
were evoked. 
Tool for regeneration
Arguments in favour of reconstruction 
reside largely in the local community: 
traditional building techniques are 
transmitted from elders to a new 
generation of builders; the project brings 
together the whole community, and the 
sites continue to serve as religious spaces 
for ceremonies and contemplation. 
Indeed, the involvement of the local 
community in the reconstruction of the 
tombs is seen in part as a reconciliation 
process and a tool for regeneration.

Current affairs
Arguments against reconstruction 
beyond the rules in the Operational 
Guidelines document of the WHC include 
a lack of transparency in the UNESCO 
decision-making process and concerns 
that decisions are made outside the 
local community by professional and 
governmental organizations. In such 
cases, it is important to document the 
decision-making process so that future 
generations may understand how 
choices were made, what options were 
considered, what values remain and 
what new ones were created. 
In addition, there is the idea of taking 
time to reflect after a trauma such as the 
one in Timbuktu, in the interest of leaving 
space for further consideration over time 
and generations. The reconstruction of all 
the tombs may erase memory over time 
and may deprive people of the space to 
reflect on the past. The half-destroyed 
Genbaku Dome at the Hiroshima Peace 
Memorial in Japan serves precisely 
this purpose as a reminder of the 
most destructive force ever created 
by humankind. 
New guidance needed
On the question of reconstruction, 
the ad hoc decision-making by the 
WHC appears to be leading to new 
approaches. The shift represents a 
challenge for keepers of the conservation 
doctrine like ICOMOS, because decisions 
from such a prestigious international 
body give credence to a different 
conservation standard. In light of 
changing circumstances, new guidance 
is needed. Conservation charters need 
to make room for new ideas and World 
Heritage tools need to be updated.
Since the rise of the conservation 
doctrine in the nineteenth century, each 
generation has added new principles 
and guidelines. A materials-based 
conservation doctrine, as manifested 
in the World Heritage Operational 
Guidelines, is still part of our legacy. 
The Burra Charter makes an important 
shift towards values-based conservation, 
focused on heritage and cultural values. 
The Nara Declaration, with its emphasis on 
cultural diversity and the relative nature of 
values, encourages heritage practitioners 
to interpret the Venice Charter through 
this new lens. This additive approach 
is a good starting point for addressing 
the reconstruction question.

professor and chairholder of the Canada 
Research Chair on Built Heritage at

Ethnic conflict and displacement 
robbed my father’s sister of opportunity. 
The family fled from Turkey to Greece in 
1922, her parents died, and she never 
went to school. She learned the reading 
basics in her 40s, from her daughter who 
was a teacher. She spent fifty years in a 
big city, surrounded by print. But when 
I tested her at age 97, I found out that 
she could only read capital letters and 
very hesitantly. At best, she puzzled out 
bus labels.
Very different was the performance of 
Sofia, who took care of me. Uprooted 
from Turkey in 1922, she attended first 
grade before becoming a homeless 
orphan. When I was learning to read, she 
was the one who helped me. She read 
our textbooks haltingly, and we used 
to laugh. But she could process entire 
sentences, so she kept practising, and 
improved. In the last years of her life, 
she would put on her reading glasses, 
open the newspaper, and read the news 
to my mother. 
Every September 8, on International 
Literacy Day, my memory goes to the 
illiterate women of my youth. Poverty 
and ethnic conflict in my native Greece 
were severe several decades ago, but 
they presented the same educational 
problems as today.
In the 1930s, when rural girls rarely 
went to school, two aunts in Athens 
hired a young woman. They were 
teachers and diligently taught her to 
read in the relatively consistent Greek 
orthography. Maria learned letters but 
never progressed beyond single words. 
Eventually she gave up. She watched 
over children who studied before her, 
but still died illiterate in her 90s. 
Early literacy
the key to fluency 
by Helen Abadzi
At a time when large-scale refugee displacements have created huge 
disruptions in the literacy of tens of thousands of children, education 
specialist Helen Abadzi – whose work has helped raise early-grade 
reading fluency to a high-level international priority − strongly 
advocates that countries and institutions “vaccinate” young children 
with literacy at an early age, and definitely before the age of eighteen. 
This three-dimensional painting reproduces 
a drawing by 11-year-old Walaa, evoking 
the memory of the time when her school 
was bombed in her home town in Syria. 
It was staged by her young friends at a 
refugee camp in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. 
The children are attending a school run by 
Save The Children, where they participate 
in educational activities, including reading.

Adult dyslexia
Decades later, as an education specialist 
at the World Bank, I appraised and 
evaluated adult literacy projects. 
Governments and NGOs tried hard to 
teach adults in the 1980s and 1990s, but 
the cases reminded me of my childhood 
images. In Bangladesh, learners decoded 
letters laboriously, even after a year of 
practice. In Burkina Faso, adults who 
had completed courses read haltingly, 
and even had trouble reading their own 
handwriting. By contrast, little-educated 
people who had learned in childhood, 
read fluently, like Sofia. The difference 
was striking.
It is not just unschooled adults who 
read laboriously. Educated foreigners 
learning languages that have unknown 
scripts experience the same difficulties. 
“Western” academics and aid workers 
who spend decades in Ethiopia or 
Bangladesh may speak the languages of 
those countries fluently, but perpetually 
read like mid-first graders. They report 
seeing a jumble of letters that must be 
decoded one by one. Reading is thus 
too tedious, and many avoid it.
These events point to a striking 
phenomenon that could be called ‘adult 
neo-literate dyslexia’. It seems to become 
significant by age 19 and probably 
affects all of us.  
University students who must learn 
different scripts past the age of 18 
typically read slowly, and for decades 
have difficulty scanning text. Several 
cognitive and neuroscientific studies 
show long-lasting reading difficulties 
for adults. Adult dyslexia may partly 
account for the very poor adult literacy 
programme outcomes worldwide. But it 
has gone unnoticed. Educators typically 
attribute these failures to social issues, 
learner motivation, or organizational 
problems. These are certainly important, 
but the results among those who persist 
are disappointing. And since this strange 
dyslexia has remained invisible, little 
direct research has gone into it.
But what is effortless reading and why 
does it matter? This competency seems 
like a commonplace rite of passage 
in childhood, but it requires specific 
changes in the brain. 
Children may be 
‘vaccinated’ with 
literacy 
Reading originates as a perceptual 
learning function; in the first few 
milliseconds, it is disconnected from 
meaning. With practice, the letter 
shapes are grouped and processed 
in the brain simultaneously. The brain 
does this most efficiently if the symbols 
are taught one by one, with pattern 
analogies. Practice combines small 
units into larger ones. Some scripts and 
spelling systems take longer than others 
to learn. But in all cultures, from France 
to China, people use the same brain 
structures to read.

Initially, learners decode single letters 
and exert conscious effort. After dozens 
of practice hours, processing moves to 
a part of the brain that recognizes words 
as if they were faces. Then multiple 
letters are decoded at one glance, like 
facial features. Simultaneously, reading 
becomes effortless, automatic. We cannot 
stop ourselves from reading, just as we 
cannot stop the recognition of people 
we know. This may happen at forty-five 
to sixty words per minute.
Thanks to perceptual learning, humans 
can learn to recognize footprints, musical 
notation, numbers, mathematical equations, 
astronomical constellations, or weather 
prediction signs. And once this visual 
function is learned and practised repeatedly, 
it is rarely forgotten. Thus children may be 
‘vaccinated’ with literacy.
Strangely, we do not need to know a 
language in order to read it fluently, nor 
do we need to be able to write the letters! 
Millions of children worldwide learn to read, 
for religious purposes, texts in unknown 
languages that differ from a country’s official 
scripts. It greatly helps to learn a consistent 
spelling system, like Spanish or Hindi rather 
than an inconsistent one, like English or 
Khmer. But to understand a text, we must be 
fluent. The limitations of short-term memory 
demand speed. Educated adults may read 
250 to 350 words per minute.
Children who drop out of school after 
attaining automaticity, may read printed 
signs in the environment and thus get 
sufficient practice to maintain the skill 
and improve it. 
This was the case of Sofia, my childhood 
care-taker. But if they drop out before 
attaining fluency, letter-by-letter decoding 
is too tedious. Like Maria and my father’s 
sister, they may pass by store signs and street 
names, but are not able to read them.
Unfortunately, the ability of children to 
automatize a large set of symbols has a 
deadline. Certain neural circuits involved 
in perception have sensitive periods and 
gradually slow down during adolescence. 
If the process to automatize reading is 
interrupted for years, precious time may be 
lost that cannot be regained.

Current affairs
Fluency by age 18 
The large-scale refugee displacements 
of the twenty-first century have created 
the perfect illiteracy storm. The schooling 
of many children has been interrupted 
at critical moments. Moving from Syria 
to Greece and to Germany, they may 
never automatize the perceptually 
challenging Arabic script. For some, 
the disruption may be permanent. And 
displacement is not the only threat to 
childhood literacy. Low-income countries 
have expanded schooling with little 
knowledge of how to teach the poor, and 
the results have created a generation of 
schooled illiterates. The problems are 
compounded by the use of English and 
French that have complex spelling. Thus, 
large numbers of African students can at 
best decipher only a few letters or words 
in those languages. Some are known to 
attend adult literacy classes as adults, 
but it may be too late for automaticity, 
according to the World Bank.
These neurological realities have 
implications for the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) as well. 
According to SDG 4.6, governments 
should ensure that all youth and a 
substantial proportion of adults, both 
men and women, achieve literacy and 
numeracy by 2030. To facilitate the 
learning process and the teachers’ 
workload, the neurocognitive research 
should be put to use. 
To activate the perceptual learning 
function, complex teaching activities 
are unnecessary. Teachers should teach 
letter-by-letter phonics and pattern 
analogies, and give lots of practice 
in class, with feedback. Practice links 
small units into larger ones, words 
and sentences.  
Thick or abundant books are 
indispensable for the ‘face’-recognition 
competency to develop. They should 
use letters that are large and spaced to 
accommodate the brain’s visual demands. 
Writing supports reading, and vocabulary 
must be learned in order to make sense 
of texts. Because the reading process is 
universal, forty-five to sixty words could 
be a rough benchmark of automaticity 
in almost all languages and scripts. 
To learn from texts and enjoy reading, 
this speed should be attained by the end 
of second grade. 
Donors and governments receive a 
lot of confusing advice about reading. 
Traditional letter-by-letter methods 
that better conformed to brain 
processes have been replaced by 
whole language activities that reflect 
middle-class perceptions. The effects 
on the poor can be severe. Students 
of consistently spelled languages may 
learn sufficient reading in first grade 
to survive subsequent interruptions. 
Old syllabaries used to accomplish this. 
But more ‘modern’ methods slow down 
the process, leaving students vulnerable 
to unexpected life shocks that may 
leave them functionally illiterate.
The World Literacy Day serves to remind 
us that we must ensure automaticity in 
childhood. This function has a deadline: 
All children must become fluent in one 
or more scripts by age 18 at the latest. 
In the future, biomedical research may 
mitigate this neurological phenomenon, 
but for 2030, the goal is clear. Wars and 
population displacements seem to be 
a feature of human evolution, but the 
education community should be ready. 
Governments and donors should put 
the existing research to use in order 
to achieve a transition to automaticity 
in first grade. In case of an emergency 
disruption, the adults should perform 
more like Sofia than like Maria.

The lack of universal access 
to effective educational 
resources remains a global 
problem. But, says Cable Green, 
the good news is that open 
education is increasing access, 
lowering costs and improving 
student learning. 
But how can educators share digital 
learning content without violating 
copyright law – how can they share 
legally? 
The key distinguishing characteristic of 
an OER is its open copyright licence and 
the legal permissions the licence grants 
the public to use, modify and share it. 
If an educational resource is not clearly 
marked as being in the public domain or 
having an open licence, it is not an OER.
The most common way to openly 
license copyrighted education resources 
– making them OER – is to add a Creative 
Commons (CC) licence to the resource. 
These licences are standardized, free-
to-use, open copyright licences that 
have already been applied to more than 
1.2 billion copyrighted works across nine 
million websites, according to the State 
of the Commons Report, 2015. When 
authors add a CC licence to their work, 
they keep their copyright and share their 
work with the public, for free, under 
the terms and conditions they choose. 
Sharing
legally and freely
for better learning
We live in an age of information 
abundance where everyone, for the 
first time in history, can access all the 
knowledge they wish. The key to this 
sea-change in education opportunity is 
Open Educational Resources (OER), freely 
available materials that can be legally 
downloaded, edited and shared to better 
serve all students.
For the last twenty years, the educational 
resources – textbooks, videos, courses, 
degree programmes, etc. – we use to 
teach people how to read and write, learn 
physics and think critically have been 
"born-digital". Even though we still use 
printed copies and employ non-internet 
delivery of learning materials, there 
exists a digital file. Thanks to the internet, 
inexpensive disc space and cloud 
computing, we can now store, distribute, 
and make copies of digital educational 
resources for the marginal cost of zero.

Leveraging 
the full power of OER
It is worth noting that “open” is not the 
same as “free”. All OER can be freely 
accessed, but not all free content is OER. 
Many Massive Open Online Courses 
(MOOCs), for example, are free but 
not open. While access to the MOOC 
content might be free, the MOOC is 
only considered OER if its contents are 
openly licensed or in the public domain. 
This becomes critically important if 
you want to translate an MOOC into 
different languages and/or modify it 
for a local context to meet the needs of 
your students. 
OER can be freely retained (keep a 
copy), reused (use as is), revised (adapt, 
adjust, modify), remixed (mash up 
different content to create something 
new), and redistributed (share copies 
with others) without breaking copyright 
law. Of course, if we want to leverage 
the full power of OER, educators and 
students also need access to Information 
and Communication Technology (ICT) 
infrastructure – computers, mobile 
devices and internet connectivity, in all 
spaces for all people.
In summary, OER are possible because: 
1) educational resources are digital (most 
OER are “born-digital,” though OER can be 
made available to students in both digital 
and printed formats) and digital resources 
can be stored, copied and distributed 
for near-zero cost; 2) the internet makes 
it simple for anyone to share digital 
content; and 3) Creative Commons open 
licences make it simple and legal to 
keep one’s copyright and legally share 
educational resources with the world.
Open resources make access 
to education easier.

Current affairs
What difference 
does OER make? 
When colleges and universities shift 
to OER, they enable a series of positive 
education changes. The first thing that 
happens is that equitable access to 
educational resources goes up. Every 
single student can have access to all of 
the educational resources that have been 
designed for them to be successful in 
the class on day one. This might sound 
obvious, but even in the United States, 
two-thirds of college and university 
students don’t buy the textbooks 
prescribed for their classes because 
they cannot afford them.
The second positive impact is all students 
get access to relevant, contextualized 
education content that has been 
designed for them. A professor in 
Mumbai can download an openly 
licensed textbook that has been shared 
by the University of Barcelona, translate 
it into Hindi, and update the book with 
examples that will appeal to his or 
her students.
Third, learning outcomes go up or stay 
the same, while price falls to near zero. 
When all students in a class have access 
to all of the resources on day one, they 
succeed. A journal-published analysis 
of more than 16,000 students at public 
institutions showed that students using 
open materials perform as well, if not 
better, than their peers using traditional 
course materials (Lane Fischer, John 
Hilton, T. Jared Robinson, and David 
Wiley: A multi-institutional study of the 
impact of open textbook adoption on 
the learning outcomes of post-secondary 
students, Journal of Computing in Higher 
Education, 2015).
Fourth, it has been observed that 
course completion rates go up. In 
a controlled application of OER at 
Tidewater Community College in 
Virginia, US, students utilizing OER 
resources in a variety of course formats 
fared up to 11% better in both course 
completion and achievement. (Lane 
Fischer, John Hilton, David Wiley and 
Linda William: Maintaining momentum 
toward graduation: OER and the course 
throughput rate, The International Review 
of Research in Open and Distributed 
Learning, 2016). 
Students remain and succeed in courses 
that provide them access to all the 
educational resources they need to 
prosper. Because more students are 
completing their courses, time-to-
degree also drops. With OER, education 
institutions help students move through 
their educational opportunities with 
greater speed and success – a more 
effective public investment.
Fifth, once we have OER in our learning 
spaces, students and teachers can shift to 
open education practices – “collaborative 
practices which include the creation, 
use and reuse of OER and pedagogical 
practices employing participatory 
technologies, peer learning, knowledge 
creation and sharing, and empowerment 
of learners” (Catherine Cronin : Openness 
and praxis: exploring the use of 
open educational practices in higher 
education, The International Review of 
Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 
2017). According to Cronin, students 
become co-producers, generators and 
creators of knowledge; they can create, 
update and improve OER as they learn.

Policy support needed
One way governments can support open 
education is to adopt a simple policy 
– require publicly-funded educational 
resources are openly licensed.
Open education licensing policies 
insert open licensing requirements 
into existing funding systems (e.g., 
grants, contracts or other agreements) 
that create educational resources, 
thereby making the content OER, and 
shifting the default on publicly-funded 
educational resources from “closed” 
to “open”. This is a particularly strong 
education policy argument – if the public 
pays for education resources, the public 
should have the right to access and use 
those resources at no additional cost 
and with the full spectrum of legal rights 
necessary to modify the OER to meet 
their local needs.
This sounds obvious, but it is not the rule. 
Unfortunately, it is almost always the 
case that publicly- funded educational 
resources are commercialized in such a 
way that access is restricted to those who 
are willing to pay for them a second time. 
Why should a nation’s citizens be required 
to pay a second time for an education 
resource they’ve already paid for?
Governments, foundations, and 
education institutions can and should 
implement open education licensing 
policies by requiring open licences on 
the educational resources produced with 
their funding. Strong open licensing 
policies make open licensing mandatory 
and apply a clear definition for open 
licence, ideally using the Creative 
Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence 
that grants full reuse rights, provided 
the original author is attributed. 
The good news is, open education 
policies are happening. In June 2012, 
UNESCO convened a World Open 
Education Resources Congress at its 
Headquarters, and released the 2012 
Paris OER Declaration, which included a 
call for governments to “encourage the 
open licensing of educational materials 
produced with public funds”. I am pleased 
to say that many governments have 
followed this recommendation.
In conclusion, if we want OER to go 
mainstream, if we want curated sets of 
OER for all grade levels, in all subjects, in 
all languages, customized to meet local 
needs; if we want significant funding 
available for the creation, adoption and 
continuous updating of OER – then 
we need (1) universal awareness of 
and systematic support for OER, and 
(2) a broad adoption of open education 
licensing policies. When all educators 
are passionate about free and open 
access to their educational resources, 
when we change the rules on the money, 
when the default on all publicly-funded 
educational resources is “open” and not 
“closed”, we will live in a world where 
everyone can attain all the education 
they desire.

They are invited to propose collaborative 
projects with an aim to promote 
solidarity, empathy, critical thinking, social 
commitment and civic involvement. 
Four themes were chosen for the workshops 
and plenary sessions: refugees and 
migration; intercultural education; the role 
of media and social media in constructing 
positive dialogue; and youth engagement 
with cultural heritage and the arts.

Volunteers
for world heritage
Launched in 2008, the World Heritage 
Volunteers Initiative gives young people the 
opportunity to dedicate themselves to the 
protection of world heritage – by acquiring 
skills and competencies, and immersing 
themselves in the lives of local communities.
For its tenth anniversary, the campaign 
proposes the implementation of fifty-one 
youth action projects in thirty-two 
countries between May and November 
2017. This year, the Vajrayogini temple 
complex in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley, the 
sixteenth-century monasteries on the slopes 
of Popocatepetl in Mexico, the parks and 
garden of Weimar in Germany, the towering 
mountain summits of the Rwenzori 
Mountains National Park in Uganda and 
many other exceptional places in the world, 
welcome young people concerned with 
the protection of the common heritage 
of mankind. 
The campaign is part of the UNESCO World 
Heritage Education Programme launched 
in 1994. It seeks to encourage and train 
tomorrow’s decision-makers to participate 
in heritage conservation and respond to 
the continuing threats facing it.

“If I were...”
“These tombs that keep us alive” is a 
strange caption for an equally strange 
photograph, taken by 27-year-old Vesal 
Sulaiman, who lives in Germany. “It fills 
me both with sadness and joy,” he says. 
The image immortalizes that moment 
during his trip to Kabul when he saw 
children forced to clean tombs for money. 
In the dead of winter and with hands 
frozen by the cold, the children climbed 
to the top of the hill behind the mosque 
to collect water! When Sulaiman asked 
them if they liked their job, they replied: 
“Yes, it allows us to go to school.” 
“I tried to imagine what it was like being 
them,” explains Vesal, one of ten finalists 
of the “If I were…” contest, launched by 
UNESCO on social media in Arabic, English, 
French and Spanish from 24 February to 
12 March 2017. In the space of two weeks, 
UNESCO received 837 submissions from 
117 countries around the world. 
Through the lens of a camera or video 
recorder, the participants, aged 21 to 
30, imagined themselves in the shoes of 
someone else. 
The ten finalists, each of whom win 
an iPad mini, are invited to present 
their photos or videos at the “Second 
International Conference on Youth 
Volunteering and Dialogue: preventing 
violent extremism and strengthening 
social inclusion”, held at UNESCO 
Headquarters in Paris, from 25 to 
27 September 2017.
During the three-day event, over a 
hundred young participants from across 
the globe have the opportunity to share 
the experiences and knowledge they 
gained as volunteers in different fields 
associated with UNESCO’s mandate.  
Giving youth a voice!
For the International 
Youth Day on August 12, 
the Courier dedicates 
these pages to UNESCO 
projects aimed at young 
generations who wish to 
be involved in voluntary 
action and dialogue.

A youth forum 
in a biosphere reserve
Young people, especially those who 
live or work in biosphere reserves, are 
the future of these areas comprising 
terrestrial, marine and coastal 
ecosystems. UNESCO believes youth 
should be given a voice in shaping their 
territory and defining their engagement 
in its Man and the Biosphere (MAB) 
Programme.
This prompted the MAB Secretariat and 
the UNESCO Regional Bureau in Venice 
to organize the 2017 MAB Youth Forum, 
in the Po Delta Biosphere Reserve, 
Italy, from 18-23 September. When the 
initiative was first announced during the 
4th World Congress of Biosphere Reserves 
in Lima, Peru, in March 2016, it received 
a standing ovation!
Addressing youth between 18 and 35, 
the Forum aims to ensure they become 
agents of change and promoters of a 
more equitable and sustainable society. 
The exchange of best practices and the 
promotion of biosphere reserves as tools 
for the achievement of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) − from the 
good management of natural resources 
to the green economy, from sustainable 
tourism to education – is an important 
focus of the Forum. 
The Forum is also aligned to UNESCO’s 
Operational Strategy on Youth 
(2014-2021), built on the premise that 
youth are key partners and actors for 
development and peace.
Youth stakeholders participated in 
a large-scale, online consultation to 
generate ideas about the issues to be 
discussed during the Forum. Three 
main thematic areas emerged − the 
contribution of young people to the 
life of biosphere reserves; research and 
study into the sustainable development 
of biosphere reserves; and a sustainable 
future for youth, giving voice to their 
concerns, and encouraging an exchange 
of best practices and business ideas, 
to be submitted to potential donors.

Fostering dialogue 
among youth 
Through its presence in 195 Member 
States across the globe, UNESCO aims to 
foster an environment that helps young 
people to blossom as individuals and 
become responsible citizens. It does this 
by encouraging innovation, creativity and 
reflection, especially on burning topics such 
as intercultural and interreligious conflicts.
To translate these ideals into reality, the 
UNESCO Office in Almaty, Kazakhstan, 
hosts the First Youth Conference on 
Intercultural and Interreligious Dialogue 
on 21 September, 2017. Bringing together 
young researchers and activists from 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan, the conference aims to find 
solutions to help resolve intercultural and 
interreligious conflicts in the region.
There is a full programme of activities, 
including a workshop on intercultural 
dialogue, an introduction to different 
cultures in the region, and opportunities to 
share experiences. Participants also learn 
to understand the attitudes and reactions 
of other cultures, and to reflect on ways to 
overcome intercultural problems. 
This initiative is designed to promote 
dialogue between religions, spiritual and 
humanist traditions, and to enable the 
understanding of their interactions and 
influences in order to combat prejudice 
and build mutual respect.

A new beginning 
for the UNESCO Courier
“Just the name of this 
emblematic publication 
evokes the essence of our 
Organization, its history, 
its values. From the first issue, 
published in February 1948, 
to the one I have in my hands, 
the Courier has remained 
faithful to its mission 
– to promote humanist 
ideals, to build bridges of 
dialogue between cultures, 
to provide a safe space for 
international debate.” 
It was with these words that Irina Bokova, 
Director-General of UNESCO, launched 
the UNESCO Courier at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse in Beijing, China, on 13 May 
2017. After an interlude (for budgetary 
reasons) of five years, the magazine 
began its new life in April 2017, thanks 
to the generous support of the People’s 
Republic of China.

Young people shouting “Long live 
the Courier!” at the magazine’s relaunch 
ceremony in Paris, on 27 April.
Appearing quarterly in a limited-edition 
print run, the Courier is once again 
available online (en.unesco.org/courier) 
in seven languages: Arabic, Chinese, 
English, French, Portuguese, Russian and 
Spanish. Access to the online edition is 
free of charge and just a few clicks are all 
that are needed to consult the archives. 
A strategy for extending the online 
presence of the magazine is currently 
being developed and partners for new 
language versions are being sought. 
“In the 1980s, the magazine was 
published in over 35 languages, thanks 
to the co-operation of the various 
National Commissions,” recalled Irina 
Bokova, as the Courier was relaunched at 
UNESCO Headquarters on 27 April 2017. 
She added that she was convinced the 
partnership with China would encourage 
“many players in the public and private 
sectors to become our partners to help 
develop the Courier on a global scale.”
The UNESCO Courier relaunch ceremony in 
Beijing took place on 13 May in the presence 
of Irina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO, 
Huang Kun Ming, Executive Vice-Minister 
of Publicity Department of the Communist 
Party of China, Tian Xue Jun, Vice-Minister 
of Education of China and Chairman of the

Countering
“everyday” racism
What do genetics say about the 
diversity of the human species? Where 
does xenophobia come from? How 
can we understand racist ideas and 
behaviour? Which model is best for 
living together, respecting equal rights? 
These are some of the questions raised 
by the “Us and Them – From Prejudice 
to Racism” exhibition at the Musée de 
l’Homme in Paris, from 31 March 2017 
to 8 January 2018, under the patronage 
of UNESCO.
Based on studies in anthropology, 
biology, sociology and history, the 
exhibition follows the same logic for 
deconstructing racism as that which 
guides UNESCO in one of its primary 
missions − to use science and public 
information to combat prejudices and 
stereotypes about human categories, 
rigid identities and otherness as a 
symbolic barrier between “us” and “them”. 
To do so, the exhibition offers visitors an 
interactive journey which allows them to 
reflect on the individual and collective 
mechanisms that lead to the rejection 
of the other. It also highlights the role of 
the International Coalition of Inclusive 
and Sustainable Cities (ICCAR), a UNESCO 
initiative to promote the peaceful 
coexistence of people within societies.
