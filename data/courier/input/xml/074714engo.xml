The water-bearers
"Water. Where I get it? Oh, I
walk two hours every time, and
two hours back. I do this twice a
day..." A young Sudanese girl
describes in these words a fact of
everyday life for many of the
world's population. According
to figures for 1980 approximately
three out of five persons in
developing countries do not have
easy access to safe drinking
water, so that rural women and
children, who usually fetch and
carry water, often trek up to ten
kilometres a day just to obtain
enough to satisfy their families'
minimum requirements. The
consequences of this situation for
health and development are
devastating. In 1981 the General
Assembly of the United Nations
launched the International
Drinking Water Supply and
Sanitation Decade, a worldwide
co-operative effort to provide
"clean water and adequate
sanitation for all by the year
1990." Photo shows two village

CHAD: The water-bearers
rHISyear marks the centenary
ofthe death ofCharlesDarwin,
the man whose theory of evo¬
lution by natural selection was un¬
questionably the most important
single scientific innovation of the
nineteenth century. Our purpose in
this issue of the Unesco Courier is to
pay homage to this great scientist
whose work laid the foundations of
modern biology; we leave to others
the task of assessing the moral and
religious repercussions of a theory
that one modern philosopher has
described as a "metaphysical
research programme".
In contrast to traditional crea¬
tionist theory, which maintained
that all forms of life had existed vir¬
tually unmodified since they were
created at the beginning of
biological time, Darwin's theory of
evolution held that existing species,
including man, had evolved over
billions of years from a single
primitive form of life.
Yet when The Origin of Species
was published in 1859, evolutionary
theory already had a long history;
Darwin himself, in the Historical
Sketch with which he prefaced later
editions of The Origin, listed over
thirty predecessors. Why then is
Darwin honoured above all others as
the symbol and the primary force
behind the greatest transformation
ever in the biological sciences?
The answer is that whereas earlier
evolutionary theories had been
speculative in character, Darwin, in
The Origin, marshalled an over¬
whelming array of evidence to sup¬
port his claim that evolution could
be seen to have occurred and that
natural selection was its driving
mechanism. On reading this
evidence Thomas Huxley, who was
to become Darwin's most able
champion, remarked admiringly:
"How stupid not to have thought of
that!"
Publication of The Origin of
Species, however, sparked off a
revolution not only in the biological
sciences but also in western man's
philosophical, moral and religious
conception of himself. Although
Darwin declared that he could "see
no good reason why the views given
in this volume should shock the
religious feelings of anyone", his
message threatened the whole edifice
of rational Christian thought as
represented by Natural Theology,
since it denied the notion of inherent
progress and purposiveness in evolu¬
tion and introduced the spectre of
randomness.
Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of
Oxford, denounced "the degrading
notion of the brute origin of him
who was created in the image of
God". Less extreme, but reflecting
the general sense of shock at this
assault on the genteel standards of
Victorian English society, was the
comment of the wife of the bishop
of Worcester: "Descended from the
apes! My dear, let us hope that it is
not true, but if it is, let us pray that it
will not become generally known. "
Comparison with the Copernican
revolution is inescapable. In the
words ofSigmund Freud: ' 'Humani¬
ty has in the course of time had to
endure from the hands of science
two great outrages upon its naive
self-love. The first was when it was
realized that our earth was not the
centre of the universe, but only a
speck in a world system of a
magnitude hardly conceivable... The
second was when biological science
robbed man of his particular
privilege of having been specially
created and relegated him to a des¬
cent from the animal world. "

THE EVOLUTION
OF A GENIUS
by Magnus Pyke
s
| 5
BYthe time Charles Darwin was twenty-
seven years old, he already had in his
possession, that is to say, in his note¬
books and in his head, all the information
on plants and animals on which, later on, he
constructed the theory of evolution and
based his ideas about the origin of species.
This theory and these ideas upset the world.
It thus came about that all those who lived
after him knew that the universe was a dif¬
ferent place from what those who lived
before had believed it to be.
As Darwin's life strikingly demonstrates,
social and ethical consequences may often
surprisingly arise from the work of people
whose activities seem to be most unpromis¬
ing and even uninteresting. Darwin as a
young man showed little promise. Nor were
his interests such as would have suggested a
potential for great scientific attainment.
In 1876, when he was sixty-seven years
old, he wrote a charming essay for his
children, without any thought that it would
ever be published. This he entitled Recollec¬
tions of the development of my mind and
character. In it he described how, as a little
boy at his first day-school, he was much
slower to learn than his younger sister
Catherine and was, as he believed, in many
ways a naughty child.
At the same time, he always had a taste
for collecting. Even in those early days, he
collected all sorts of things, not only plants,
birds' eggs, shells. and minerals, but coins
and seals as well. He also made an effort to
learn the names of plants. Whether his love
of fishing can be taken as part of his interest
in collecting or not, it undoubtedly led to his
spending long hours on the bank of a river
or a pond watching the float and thus pro¬
vided time for quiet contemplation.
In that period of his life, no one had any
thought of his becoming a scientist. In 1818,
when he was nine years old, he was sent to
"Dr Butler's great school at Shrewsbury",
where he remained for seven years until the
summer of 1825. This school taught him
nothing of value to his later life. The
MAGNUS PYKE, British scientist and
popularizer of science, was Secretary of the
British Association for the Advancement of -
Science and Chairman of its Council from 1973 to
1977. He is the author of many popular works on
science and society including Butter Side Up:
Delights of Science (John Murray, 1976) and Out
Future: Dr. Magnus Pyke Predicts IHamlyn 1980)
as well as specialized studies such as Food
Science and Technology (John Murray, 1970).
This article is adapted from a chapter contributed
by Dr. Pyke to a book being published this month
by Unesco and the Mendelianum of the Moravian
Museum, Czechoslovakia: From Biology to
Biotechnology, edited by Colette Kinnon, Alex¬
ander Kholodilin and Vitezslav Orel.
teaching was confined to Latin, Greek and
ancient geography and history.
He left school neither high nor low in
comparison with his fellows and was con¬
sidered in general a very ordinary boy. His
father, though fond of him, once had occa¬
sion to say to him "You care for nothing
but shooting, dogs and rat catching, and
you will be a disgrace to yourself and all
your family".
Perhaps this was a very harsh judgment.
When he was taught the geometry of Euclid
by a private tutor, he experienced intense
pleasure at the clear and rational proofs. He
felt similar delight when his uncle explained
to him the principle of the vernier of a
barometer. But his main enthusiasm at six¬
teen, an enthusiasm which he retained for
many years, was shooting.
It was, perhaps, a sign of some stirring of
scientific curiosity that impelled him to
volunteer to serve as an assistant to his
brother who was studying chemistry and
who had set up something of a laboratory in
the garden tool-shed of their house. The two
boys often worked here half the night, im¬
mersed in their experiments. When Charles'
schoolmaster, the formidable Dr Butler,
heard what he was doing, he delivered a
public rebuke, accusing him of "wasting his
time on such useless subjects".
In October 1825, his father, seeing that he .
was doing no good at school, sent him to
Edinburgh University with the idea of his
becoming a doctor. The notion of his taking
up medicine as a career was not proposed as
a means for him to develop such scientific
bent as he might possess. Rather, medicine
was considered to be a useful, honourable
and gentlemanly occupation.
But although Charles Darwin gained little
or no benefit from the official course of in¬
struction in medicine, his interest in science
was awakening through his association with
a number of bright young men who were
fond of natural science.
An indication of Darwin's growing at¬
tachment to biological science was his
friendship with a Dr Grant, his senior by
several years, who subsequently became
professor of zoology in University College.
Stimulated by these men, he took part in ex¬
peditions to collect animals in tidal pools by
the sea-shore." These activities had nothing
to do with his medical curriculum. Never¬
theless, they illustrate a fundamental factor
in the development of the thinking of a
young man destined to make one of the ma¬
jor scientific discoveries of his century.
It is interesting to note that in 1826, when
he had only attended Edinburgh University
for a year, Charles Darwin published two
short papers on conclusions arising from the
5

observations he had made when collecting
sea creatures from tidal pools around
Newhaven. Thus, simply and while still a
student, and in spite of the discouragement
of his schoolmaster and the tedium of his of¬
ficial teachers at the university, his life as a
scientist can be seen to have begun.
After Charles Darwin had spent two ses¬
sions at Edinburgh University, his father
formed the opinion, partly from his own
observations and partly from what Charles'
sister had told him, that he did not like the
idea of becoming a doctor. Since he was
strongly averse to his son turning into an
idle sporting man, he proposed to Charles
that he should become a clergyman.
The young man considered his father's
proposition very carefully. He liked the idea
of becoming a country parson. He believed
at that time in the literal truth of every word
in the Bible, it never having entered his head
to do otherwise. After having read one or
two books on theology, he found no dif¬
ficulty in accepting the dogma of the
Church of England and, therefore, in agree¬
ing to his father's suggestion. In view of
some of the implications of the deductions
which arose from his subsequent theory of
the origin of species, his willingness at the
age of nineteen to take Holy Orders is
strangely paradoxical.
In order to become an Anglican
clergyman in 1 828, it was necessary to take a
degree at one of the two English universities
of Oxford or Cambridge. And so once more
we find Charles Darwin at a university,
ostensibly studying a subject in which he
had no interest. On the other hand, casually
attending a public lecture by John Henslow
on botany, he found himself enchanted by
its clarity and by the admirable drawings
with which it was illustrated. More than
this, he enjoyed the field excursions which
Henslow used to organize, on foot, in
coaches, or in a barge down the river. But
there was no pursuit at Cambridge which he
enjoyed so much as collecting beetles.
None of this, of course, had anything to
do with becoming a clergyman. On the other
hand, his invention of two new methods of
collecting beetles (by employing a labourer
to scrape the moss off old trees during the
winter, and by collecting the rubbish at the
bottom of the barges used to transport
rushes) was an indication of what was to
come. And again, as when he was a student
in Edinburgh, so now when he was an
undergraduate at Cambridge, his name ap¬
peared in the scientific literature, this time
as the magic words, "captured by C. Dar¬
win", in Stephen's Illustrations of British
Insects.
Undoubtedly, there was already
something about this idle theological stu¬
dent that attracted the attention of people
such as Professor Henslow and distinguish¬
ed him from the ordinary run of students.
Professor Henslow kept open house once a
week when he invited older members of the
university who were interested in one or
other of the branches of science. He invited
young Darwin and obviously took to him.
They soon dropped into the habit of taking
long walks together when the conversation
ranged over botany, entomology, chemistry,
mineralogy, geology and yes, this was in¬
cluded tooreligion.
Darwin appreciated Henslow's wide
knowledge and his habit of long-continued
observation from which he drew his conclu¬
sions. It is interesting to note that in a later
account of Henslow he described him as one
whose "judgment was excellent, and his
whole mind well balanced; but I do not sup¬
pose that any one would say he possessed
much original genius". The Encyclopedia
Britannica, after noting that he was, with
Sedgwick, responsible for founding the
Cambridge Philosophical Society, lists as his
claim to celebrity that "to him Darwin
largely owed his attachment to natural
history and his introduction to Captain
Fitzroy of H.M.S. Beagle".

His three years at Cambridge he later
described as among the happiest in his life.
He enjoyed his shooting and hunting. He
got into a sporting set who dined, drank and
played cards together. He also associated
with a musical set of jolly young men. His
summer vacations were given up to his
hobby of collecting beetles. In the autumn
he devoted himself to shooting.
How easily might he have slipped into the
life of a conventional middle-class
gentleman. How easily could he have
become a country clergyman whose side in¬
terest was entomology. But while he was still
at Cambridge, two incidents changed the
whole pattern of his career.
Because of his incompetence in the
classics, Darwin had not been able to begin
his studies in Cambridge on the appropriate
date. The university authorities, therefore,
required that he stay at his college for two
extra terms. To fill in his time usefully, Pro¬
fessor Henslow arranged for him to accom¬
pany his colleague Sedgwick on a geological
expedition which the latter was undertaking
in North Wales. Charles Darwin jumped at
the opportunity and it was while he was col¬
lecting geological specimens on this trip that
he came to realize that such a collection was
not of scientific interest for its own sake but
was rather of value for the way in which it
contributed to a coherent hypothesis
capable of explaining how it was that rocks
of a particular type got where they were.
The second incident came hard on the .
heels of the first. On returning home after
his geological tour with Sedgwick, Darwin
found a letter from Henslow awaiting him.
In this letter Henslow mentioned that a Cap¬
tain Fitzroy, who had been commissioned
by the Government to undertake a round-
the-world survey, had formed the idea of
taking with him a naturalist to survey the
plants and animals encountered during the
voyage. The job was unpaid but would
clearly be of interest to someone with an ap¬
propriate bent. Darwin was attracted by the
idea and was anxious to accept the invita¬
tion. Having obtained his father's permis¬
sion, Darwin set off for Cambridge to see
Henslow and, briefed by him, travelled on
to London to be interviewed by Captain
Fitzroy, the leader of the expedition and
captain of the ship.
How nearly Darwin was rejected he only
learned later on. At the time, Captain Fitz¬
roy was an ardent disciple of the Swiss
divine and mystic, Johann Kaspar Lavater.
Lavater was famous for his work on
physiognomy, a so-called science which pur¬
ported to enable its adherents to read a
man's character from the shape of his
features. Fitzroy believed in this system and
was convinced that he could judge the abili¬
ty of each candidate who came before him
by the shape of his nose. Looking carefully
at Darwin, he was filled with doubt whether
anyone with a nose like his could possess
sufficient energy and determination for the
voyage. Luckily, Fitzroy overcame his
doubts and came later to accept that Dar¬
win's nose had spoken falsely.
Thus, almost by chance, as it would seem,
Darwin set sail as a biologist to collect the
information from which he came to draw
the conclusions which changed the
understanding of future generations. "The
voyage of the Beagle", he wrote later, "has
been by far the most important event in my
life and has determined my whole career".
It kept him away from home for five years,
from December 1831 to October 1836. He
was twenty-two when he left and twenty-
seven when he returned.
The ship sailed from England to the Cape
Verde Islands and other islands in the Atlan¬
tic, then on to the east coast of South
America, to Tierra del Fuego, the west coast
of South America, calling at the Galapagos
Islands in the Pacific. These constitute an
archipelago of twelve large and several hun¬
dred small islands, six hundred miles from
the nearest land, in Ecuador. They were
discovered by the Spaniards early in the six¬
teenth century and owe their name to the
presence in them of large numbers of
characteristic giant tortoises. Galápago is
the Spanish word for a tortoise. These and
other creatures peculiar to the islands were
important to Darwin's thesis because they
had lived undisturbed by outside influences
and, primarily, the influence of man.
Sailing further west, the Beagle visited
Tahiti on the way to New Zealand, Australia
and Tasmania, then on to Keeling Island,
the Maldives in the Indian Ocean,
Mauritius, St. Helena, Ascension Island and
Brazil. Leaving Brazil, they sailed back to
the Verdes and on to the Azores in mid-
Atlantic on their way home.
Whatever reputation Charles Darwin had
acquired as a schoolboy and an under¬
graduate for sports, idleness or dili¬
gence he showed himself during this five-
year expedition to be enormously in¬
dustrious. Not only did he keep a detailed
diary of every item of scientific interest in
the geology, botany and zoology of each
region, but he also set down with delighted
curiosity particulars of the people living in
each place and the incidents that befell
himself and his fellow travellers.
Charles Darwin came home from his
voyage in October 1836. During the period
from then until September 1842, a period of
six years, he lived first in Cambridge and
then in London. These years were devoted
to the codifying and organizing of the mass
of information which he had collected. In
1839, he published a narrative of the survey¬
ing voyages of the Beagle's round-the-world
cruise. In 1840, he published two sections of
Engraving by the ornithologist and artist
John Gould of the Rhea Darwinii, a rare
species of flightless, ostrich-like bird from

1834 during an expedition near Port Desire.

a work on The Zoology of the Voyage ofthe
Beagle. More came out in 1841, 1842 and
1843. Indeed he went on writing and
publishing for much of the rest of his life.
He undoubtedly worked hard and thought
deeply. Nevertheless, his ideas developed
slowly. Furthermore, he was hampered by ill
health.
Before setting sail on the great voyage,
when he was troubled by the thought of
leaving his family and friends, he believed
he had a heart disease and complained of
"palpitation and pain about the heart".
Now, during his time in London, and after
having married his cousin, Emma
Wedgwood, in 1839, he suffered from "fre¬
quently recurring unwellness, and to one
long and serious illness". He was then thirty
(he lived to the age of seventy-three). In
September 1842, he bought a house in the
country, at Downe in the county of Kent,
where he lived for the rest of his life, seeing
few people and taking little or no part in
social life. Throughout this period, he com¬
plained of ill health. Dinner parties, which
"always put me into high spirits", he avoid¬
ed because, he found, "my health almost
always suffered from the excitement, violent
shivering and vomiting attacks being thus
brought on."
In 1842, the year in which Darwin install¬
ed himself at Downe and six years after the
completion of his collections in the Beagle,
he allowed himself to write down only in
pencil an outline of a theory to explain the
origin of new species of creatures from their
predecessors. In fact he had already had this
notion in his head for four years. "In Oc-

In January 1839, some two years after the Beagle returned to
England, Charles Darwin married his cousin Emma Wedgwood,
seen here at the age of 32 in a portrait by Charles Richmond. The
marriage was a happy one. A gay, attractive, intelligent woman,
Emma took a keen interest in music and was devoutly religious.
She nursed Darwin through his long bouts of illness and never
wavered in her support for him as a man of integrity, even though
she suffered greatly to see him gradually losing his religious faith.
This moving letter to Darwin was found among her papers after
her death. On it Darwin had written "When I am dead, know that
many times I have kissed and cried over this. CD."
"...The state of mind that I wish to preserve with respect to you is
to feel that while you are acting conscientiously and sincerely
wishing and trying to learn the truth, you cannot be wrong, but
there are some reasons that force themselves upon me, andprevent
me from being always able to give myself this comfort. I dare say
you have often thought of them before, but I will write down what
has been in my head, knowing that my own dearest will indulge me.
Your mind and time are full of the most interesting subjects and
thoughts of the most absorbing kind, viz. following up your own
discoveries but which make it very difficult for you to avoid
casting out as interruptions other sorts of thoughts which have no
relation to what you are pursuing, or to be able to give your whole
attention to both sides of the question... May not the habit in
scientific pursuits of believing nothing till it is proved, influence
your mind too much in other things which cannot be proved in the
same way, and which if true are likely to be above our comprehen¬
sion ?... Ido not wish for any answer to all this it is a satisfaction
to write it, and when I talk to you about it I cannot say exactly
what I wish to say, and I know you will have patience with your
own dear wife. Don 't think that it is not my affair and that it does
not signify much to me. Everything that concerns you concerns
me, and I should be most unhappy if I thought we did not belong
to each other forever... ".
Here perhaps lies the true answer to the much discussed riddle as to
why Darwin delayed so long in publishing The Origin of Species,
a delay (see caption opposite page) which nearly cost him very
dearhe could not bring himself to affront the deeply-held
religious beliefs of his beloved Emma.

tober 1838", he wrote, "that is fifteen
months after I had begun my systematic en¬
quiry, I happened to read for amusement
Malthus on 'Population', and being well
prepared to appreciate the struggle for ex¬
istence which everywhere goes on from long-
continued observation of the habits of
animals and plants, it at once struck me that
under these circumstances favourable varia¬
tions would tend to be preserved, and un¬
favourable ones to be destroyed. The result
of this would be the formation of new
species. Here, then, I had at least got a
theory by which to work; but I was so anx¬
ious to avoid prejudice, that I determined
not for some time to write even the briefest
sketch of it."
And so he ruminated as the years went by
and gradually refined and improved his
ideas about evolution and the origin of
species. His early conception provided no
explanation of why biological species
descended from the same stock should
diverge in character as they became
modified. His conclusion was that "the
modified offspring of all dominant and in¬
creasing forms tend to become adapted to
many highly diversified places in the
economy of nature." In describing how he
reached this hypothesis, he wrote, "I can
remember the very spot on the road, whilst
in my carriage, when to my joy the solution
occurred to me." This sentence reveals
something about the nature of scientific
discoverythat ideas can come to the
prepared mind; that they may strike as a
sudden flash of intuition, and that, when
they do, they engender a feeling of delight.
The process of reflection and thought, the
consideration and reconsideration of
evidence drawn from his own observations
and from those of others, went on for twen¬
ty years until early in 1856 Sir Charles Lyell,
the leading geologist of the day, advised
Darwin to publish his ideas. Darwin at once
began to prepare an extensive exposition.
Even so, by the summer of 1858 he was only
about half finished. Then one day through
the post came a letter from a Mr Alfred
Wallace. This man was a surveyor and ar¬
chitect with a strong taste for natural history
who was at that time exploring in Malaya.
He enclosed with his letter a paper entitled
On the tendency of varieties to depart in¬
definitely from the original type. Darwin
was thunderstruck to find that Wallace's
essay contained exactly the same theory
about the origin of species as his own.
Here then we find a characteristic of
scientific discovery that repeatedly occurs.
The great men and women who make
outstanding discoveries are undoubtedly
ahead of their times, but often by not very
much. Knowledge grows and it may then
happen that discoveries come to be made,
but only when the time is ripe for making
them. Although there had been some ques¬
tioning here and there, up to the time of
Darwin it was generally assumed that species
were separate and always had been so. Fur¬
thermore, most of the great religions re¬
counted as revealed truth how different
animals had been created different from the
beginning at the creation of the world. But
although there had been changes in the
understanding of geologists who directed
their attention to the fossils of animals
embedded in the rocks (the palaeon¬
tologists), it was only in Darwin's own time
that it became apparent that the length of
time needed for the formation of the diverse
Alfred Rüssel Wallace
This portrait of the naturalist Alfred Rüssel Wallace was painted
over a photograph by Thomas Sims and is now in the National
Portrait Gallery, London. In 1858, Wallace independently
discovered the principle of natural selection and sent Darwin a
short essay, On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely
from the Original Type, in which the principle of natural selection
was expounded. In a brief accompanying note Wallace wrote that
he was hopeful that it "would supply the missing factor to explain
the origin ofspecies" and asked Darwin, if hefound it "sufficient¬
ly important", to forward it to the geologist Charles Lyell. The
manuscript came as a bombshell to Darwin. For some years Lyell
had been urging him to publish his theory, but suddenly it seemed
that Wallace had effectively pre-empted his life work. "Your
words have come true with a vengeance that ¡should beforestall¬
ed", he wrote to Lyell; and he added, "I never saw a more striking
coincidence. If Wallace had my manuscript written out in 1842, he
could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now
stand as heads of my chapters". Charles Lyell and the botanist
Joseph Hooker found an elegant solution that was fair to both
men. They arrangedfor ajoint Darwin- Wallace memoir on natural
selection to be read at a meeting of the Linnean Society in July
1858. Both Darwin and Wallace were honourable men. "I would
far rather", Darwin told Lyell, "burn my whole book than that he
[Wallace] or any other man should think that I had behaved in a
paltry spirit". And to the end ofhis life Wallace accorded priority
to Darwin. In an address to a meeting of the Linnean Society held
in 1908 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Darwin-
Wallace memoir, Wallace declared: "I should have had no cause
for complaint if the respective share of Darwin and myself... had
been. . . estimated as being roughly proportional to the time we had
each bestowed upon it... as twenty years is to one week. If he had
published his theory after ten years, fifteen years, or even eighteen
years elaboration of it, I should have had no part in it whatever... "

Cartoon of Darwin from The Hornet, 22 March 1871.
Contrary to popular belief, Darwin never claimed that
man was descended from the ape, but only that both
shared a common ancestor.
rocks of which the earth is composed and
the animals whose fossils are found in them
was much longer than holy writ allowed. In
short, although it needed talented men to
perceive the meaning of the evidence, the
time was ripe for that perception to come
about. And so it came to two biologists: to
Darwin, sitting contemplating his specimens
in his country house in England, and to
Wallace in Malaya.
Wallace's essay together with an abstract
of Darwin's conclusions were read conjoint¬
ly at a meeting of the Linnean Society in
London in 1858 and published together the
following year.
Darwin had received a jolt. However, on
the advice of his scientific friends and spur¬
red by his own ambition, he got to work
and, delayed as ever by bouts of ill health,
completed the chief work of his life, the
writing of his book On the Origin of
Species, in thirteen months. It was publish¬
ed in November 1859. The whole of the first
edition was sold on the day of publication.'
Darwin himself explained its immediate and
continuing success as being to some degree
due to the fact that, in spite of his having
allowed twenty-three years to elapse bet¬
ween his return home with the data on
which his hypothesis was based and the
publication of his conclusions as a coherent
narrative, this time could not be taken as en¬
tirely wasted. In fact, it gave the members of
the community, both scientific and lay,
some opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the conception of evolution.
We now come to the time when the new
discoverythis fresh approach to biology
and the origin of species having been made
public, began to exert its social influence on
the community. Its impact was profound.
Looking back after the lapse of more than a
century, the fundamental nature of the
disturbance which the Darwin-Wallace
theory exerted on people's preconceived
ideas about the world and the creatures in- it
is difficult to understand. Today, the theory
seems to us to be self-evident. The first prin¬
ciple of the theory of evolution is, as
Wallace put it in his essay, that "the life of
wild animals is a struggle for existence".
The second principle is that variations that
take place in the typical form of a species
(neither Darwin nor Wallace specified what
it was that caused such variations to occur)
will have an effect, for good or ill, on the
capacity of that species to survive. This prin¬
ciple is summarized in the phrase "the sur¬
vival of the fittest". By this means do
species originate and change by a process of
evolution. As Wallace wrote: "the giraffe
[did not] acquire its long neck by desiring to
reach the foliage of the more lofty shrubs
and constantly stretching its neck for the
purpose, but because any variations which
occurred among its antitypes with a longer
neck than normal at once secured a fresh
range of pasture over the same ground as
10
their short-necked companions, and on the
first scarcity of food were thereby enabled
to outlive them."
This theory exerted the powerful social ef¬
fect it did for three main reasons. First, it
ran counter to the word of holy writ in
which people believed unquestioningly as
describing the different animals and plants
having been created so. Secondly, it was
deeply disturbing for its implication that,
just as each species of animal and plant
evolved from a less successful predecessor,
so also had manthat paragon of animals,
as Shakespeare put it, but an animal never¬
theless from a lower form. Third¬
ly, it took yet one further step along the
road implying that the value-free rationality
of science was the primary means by which a
person views the environment, rather than
the exaltation of revelation.
On the Origin of Species was published in
1859. The following year, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science
held its annual meeting in Oxford. At that
meeting, Thomas Henry Huxley, one of the
foremost lecturers of his time, a Professor at
the Royal College of Surgeons who later was
appointed to a chair at the Royal Institution
and became President of the Royal Society,
was speaking about the implications of Dar¬
win's work. In the discussion that followed,
Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford,
violently attacked Darwin's entire
hypothesis and rounded furiously upon
Huxley to ask him whether it was upon his
grandfather's or his grandmother's side that
he was descended from a venerable ape
This confrontation made a deep impression.
Huxley, standing his ground, replied to the
bishop that if he were asked to claim paren¬
tage from a man, great in the affairs of
Church and State, who mocked the earnest
seeker after truth, or with a monkey,
grovelling and chattering in its cage yet
representing the mystery and wonder of
nature, he would have difficulty in deciding
which to choose. A lady on the platform,
who had never heard an Anglican bishop
thus rebuffed in his own see, fainted.
The idea of evolution, supported on the
one hand by observations made by Darwin
of variations in the creatures found in the
Galapagos Islands and by Wallace from
parallel observations in the islands of the
Malay Archipelago, was a potent one. Nor
was Bishop Wilberforce the only leader to
believe that "the principle of natural selec¬
tion is absolutely incompatible with "the
work of God." Cardinal Manning described
it as a "brutal philosophy to wit, there is
no God and the ape is our Adam".
Monseigneur Ségur in France wrote: "These
infamous doctrines have for their only sup¬
port the most abject passions. Their father is
pride, their mother impurity, their offspring
revolutions." In a bitter book called Science
and the Bible, Dr Perry, Bishop of
Melbourne, declared that the object of Dar¬
win and Huxley was not so much to advance
truth and understanding as to "produce in
their readers a disbelief in the Bible".

was published, science was bringing changes
in many directions. The achievements were
welcomed with pride as indications of
human progress. The theory of evolution,
however, was disturbing. Its discoverers,
and the members of the communities to
which they belonged, could, on the one
hand, take pride in the extension of their
understanding of the biological principles by
which species originated. At the same time,
it came to many people as a shock to have to
accept that they themselves, like all other
species of biological life, had evolved too
from lower forms, less than human. The
acrimonious debate, of which the clash of
Wilberforce and Huxley was the beginning,
was long drawn out. Echoes continue here
and there to this very day. For the most
part, however, the basic principles of the
theory of evolution conceived by Darwin
and Wallace have been accepted as true. If
there are those who feel that belief in
biological evolution involves loss or the
weakening of formerly held religious beliefs,
there are others who see gain in a deeper
perception of man's relationship with the
other species of creatures with whom the
human species must share the earth.
Wallace, the man who was the first to put
together coherent evidence to support the
theory of evolution, wrote long afterwards
in 1870, with a generosity not always found
in a scientist, of the way in which Darwin's
thinking, particularly as written in his great
book, changed the world.
"I have felt all my life, and I still feel, the
most sincere satisfaction that Mr Darwin
had been at work long before me, and that it
was not left for me to write On the Origin of
Species. I-have long since measured my own
strength, and know well that it would be
quite unequal to that task. Far abler men
than myself may confess that they .have not
that untiring patience in accumulating and
that wonderful skill in using large masses of
facts of the most varied kind, that wide and
accurate physiological knowledge, that
acuteness in devising and skill in carrying
out experiments, and that admirable style of
composition, at once clear, persuasive, and
judicial qualities which in their har¬
monious combination mark out Mr Darwin
as the man, perhaps of all men now living,
best fitted for the great work he has under¬
taken and accomplished".

Many of Darwin's critics objected that no fossil remains had been found of intermediate or transitional forms
which, according to his theory, must have linked up the species. The finding, in 1861, of the Archaeopteryx fossil
did much to silence these criticisms. Archaeopteryx had bird-like characteristics such as wings and feathers, but
like the reptiles it had claws at the end of its forelimbs, teeth and a long bony tail.
THE PROBLEM
DARWIN SOLVED
by Isaac Asimov
THE notion of biological evolution is
quite old. It began when biologists
tried to classify living things. The
Greek philosopher, Aristotle, was among
the first to do so, back in the fourth century
BC.
Eventually, in 1737, the Swedish botanist,
Carolus Linnaeus, worked out a system in
which living things could be arranged into
ISAAC ASIMOV, of the USA, is internationally
known as a popularizer of science and a science
fiction writer. His huge output ofpublished works
reflects the variety of his interests which include:
literary criticism, psychology, mathematics,
mystery, poetry and humour. In 1979 he publish¬
ed his 200th book, assigning the same number to
two works: Opus 200 (Houghton Miff/in), an
Asimov anthology, and In Memory Yet Green
(Doub/eday), the first volume of his
autobiography.

different kinds (species), similar species
could be gathered into groups, and these
into groups of similar groups, and so on. It
became possible to draw a diagram
separating all of life into a few chief
branches, each of these into smaller
branches, and each of these into still smaller
branches, until one finally ended with in¬
dividual-species, rather like the individual
leaves of a tree.
Imagine that through some magic, all we
could see of a real tree were its individual
leaves distributed in space. Would we sup¬
pose that somehow those leaves had just
sprung into existence where they were?
Surely not! We would suppose they were
part of a tree which had grown from a
simple shoot, developing branches and
sub-branches from which the leaves grew.
In the same way, scientists began to
wonder if there might not be a "tree of life"
that grew something like an ordinary tree; if
present-day species might not have
developed from simpler species; and those
from simpler species still; until originally all
had developed from one original form of
very simple life. This process is called
"biological evolution".
Through the 1800s, scientists discovered-
and studied objects in the rocks that were
called "fossils". They had the shapes of
bones, teeth, shells and other objects that
had once been alive, but they must have
been trapped in rock for millions of years
until they had slowly turned into rock
themselves.
These fossils were forms of life that were
not quite like living species, but were related
to them. The fossils filled in earlier branches

Of mice and moths
Darwin's theory of natural selection was
based on four ideas about species. It is easy
to follow the steps in Darwin's argument if
we apply these four ideas to a living
population...
1. More than enough offspring
All species are capable of producing more
than enough offspring to replace
themselves.
One pair of mice can produce a litter of
about six offspring as many as six times a
year. Within six weeks, these offspring
could produce litters of their own.
If all these mice survived and continued to
breed, just imagine how many mice there
could be...
Why isn't the earth covered with mice?
Although a pair of mice can produce far
more than enough offspring to replace
themselves, the numbers in any population
tend to remain more or less the same,
because not all the offspring survive to
reproduce.

A mouse might be eaten by a predator.
2. The struggle to survive
The environment may affect an individual's
chances of survival.
All living things interact with their
environment. The environment provides
food, space and suitable surroundings to
live in, but it also includes competitors and
predators. So, in any population, not all
individuals survive to reproduce...
Or it might not find a mate.
Or it might not be able to get enough food.
3. Some important differences
Because individuals are not all identical,
some are more likely to survive than others.
No two mice are exactly alike, and some of
the variations between them may affect
their chances of survival.
Not all mice are the same colour-
darker than others.
-some are
Against a dark background, the pale mice
are easier to see, so they are the ones more
likely to be eaten by owls. The dark mice
are better adapted to this environment, and
are more likely to survive and produce
offspring.

4. A question of inheritance
Some characteristics are passed on to the next generation.
Some of the variations between individuals are inherited.
For example, mice inherit the colour of their coats.
In an area of dark soil, dark mice are less likely to be
seen by predators, and they have a better chance of
surviving to reproduce. So their characteristics are the
ones most likely to be passed on to the next generation.
In the next generation, there will be a higher proportion
of dark mice than before.
If conditions remain the same, the proportion of dark
mice in the population will continue to increase. Over many generations, the proportion of well-
adapted individuals in a population is likely to
increase. Darwin called this process natural
selection.
Natural selection provides an explanation of
how the characteristics of a population can
change as individuals become better adapted to
their environment.
Peppered moths changing with the times.
One effect of natural selectionthe characteristics of a population can change.
Peppered moths are fairly common in
Britain.
Several species of birds eat peppered
moths, taking them from the tree
trunks where they rest during the day.
During the nineteenth century, the
moths' environment changed
dramatically. Before the Industrial
Revolution, most tree trunks had a
mottled, grey appearance because they
were encrusted with lichens.
. Towards the end of the century, soot
and smoke from factories killed most
of the lichens and blackened the trees
in many industrial areas.
Compare the two environments. In
each situation, which moths are more
likely to survive and leave offspring?
These two collections are typical of the peppered moth populations
around Manchester in 1850 and 1900.

in the tree of life, and gave hints as to the
way in which particular species of life had
evolved. For instance, there were horse-like
animals that lived millions of years ago.
They were small to begin with, and had as
many as four hooves on each leg. As time
went on, other species were found which
were larger, and had fewer hooves, until
finally the modern horse came into being.
There were other animals that left no
descendants, like the magnificent
"dinosaurs", huge creatures that were
related to modern reptiles (particularly
alligators), which all went out of existence,
or became "extinct", 65,000,000 years ago.
Even though many scientists began to
suspect that biological evolution had taken
place, it didn't sound very convincing
because no one knew how it could take
place. What could possibly make one
species change into another? No one had
ever seen a species change. Cats always had
kittens, dogs had puppies, and cows had
calves. There were never any mistakes.
The first scientist to make a serious at¬
tempt to work out the how of evolution was
a Frenchman, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck.
He thought it arose out of the way in which
organisms lived. If an antelope fed on the
leaves of trees, it would spend its life
stretching its neck to reach leaves higher and
higher on the tree. Its neck would grow
slightly longer over a lifetime of stretching,
and its young would inherit the slightly
longer neck. It would stretch it still further
until finally after a long, long time, the
giraffe would have developed. This is called
"evolution by inheritance of acquired
characteristics."
It didn't work. In the first place acquired
characteristics aren't inherited. You might
cut the tail off a mouse, but its young will all
be born with tails that aren't even shorter
than normal. In the second place, how did
the giraffe get its splotched coat, which
blends in so usefully with the background of
splotchy shadows cast by trees, thus hiding
it from its enemies? Can the giraffe have
tried to be splotchier? Of course not.
Then, in 1859, Darwin's The Origin of
Species introduced a real solution to the
problem.
He considered that living organisms
generally have more young than can
possibly be supported by the food supply. If
all the baby deer that were born grew up to
be adult deer, generation after generation,
there would soon be enough deer to strip the
trees and vegetation and all would starve.
This doesn't happen because only a few of
the baby deer live to become adult. Most are
eaten by other animals. There is competition
among the baby deer, so to speak, to see
which can remain alive long enough to have
baby deer of their own.
Consider this, too. When you study
young animals, you find they are not exact¬
ly alike. There are always some differences.
Some are a little stronger than others, or a
little faster-running, or have a colour that
blends in a little better with the background
and hides them, or whatever. In the com¬
petition to grow up safely, some have ad¬
vantages that work in their favour, in other
words. They're the ones that are more likely
16
to grow up, and pass their characteristics on
to their children. These characteristics, you
see, are not acquired, they are inborn. They
are "natural variations."
Human beings take advantage of the
natural variations in their domesticated
animals and plants. They select horses that
are faster, cows that give more milk, hens
that lay more eggs, sheep that have more
wool, wheat that grows more ears of grain,
and see to it that those in particular give
birth to young. In this way, over the
thousands of years that people have
domesticated animals they have developed
breeds that are far different from the
originaland far better, for human
purposes.
Nature does this too. It selects, from
among the young, those that have a better
In 1866, an Austrian Augustinian monk,
Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884),
published an article entitled Experiments
with Plant Hybrids which laid the
foundations of the science of genetics. His
work went unnoticed during his lifetime
and it was not until the turn of the century
that its full significance was recognized.
Although they were contemporaries,
Darwin was unaware of Mendel's work
and his views on heredity were purely
speculative. Mendelian genetics filled this
gap by providing exactly the mechanism of
heredity required for evolution by natural
selection.
chance; those that are faster and can outrun
their enemies; those that are stronger and
can beat off their enemies; those that are
cleverer and can outwit their enemies; those
that have better teeth and can eat more effi¬
ciently, and so on.
In this way, horse-like animals grew larger
and stronger, and developed fewer hooves
per limb so as to be more efficient in runn¬
ing. This is through selection, not by people
but by nature. It is "evolution by natural
selection." Since people work with in¬
telligence, they can produce noticeable
changes in a few generations. Nature works
hit-and-miss, however. Often the better
organism manages to get caught by an
enemy through a stroke of bad luck. Evolu¬
tion by natural selection can require millions
of years, therefore, to form new species.
The ingenuity of Darwin's notion of
natural selection, and the careful way in
which he presented observation and reason¬
ing in this book, convinced some scientists
at once. As time went on, it convinced
more. Nowadays, scientists generally ac¬
cept biological evolution on an essentially
Darwinian basis. They accept the impor¬
tance of natural selection as the chief driving
force of such evolution.
There were, however, problems from the
start, and in the century and a quarter that
has passed since Darwin's books, many im¬
provements and advances have been made.
For instance, natural selection depends on
inborn variations but how are these preserv¬
ed? Suppose that a particular colour ar¬
rangement is useful as camouflage and that
an animal with that colour is more likely to
survive. It may mate with an animal with a
different colour arrangement and if the
young have intermediate colours, tne advan¬
tage will be lost.
In the 1860s, however, an Austrian
botanist, Gregor Mendel, experimented
with pea plants that showed different
characteristics of one sort or another. He
crossed one with another and observed the
characteristics in the seedlings as they grew.
It turned out that characteristics did not
blend into intermediate forms. Thus, if tall
plants were crossed with short ones, some of
the seedlings grew tall and some grew short
but none were intermediate.
Mendel published his results, but his
paper was ignored. It was not till 1900 that
other botanists coming up with similar
results looked through scientific journals to
see what had been done before and came
across Mendel's paper. Mendel had died in
1884 so he never knew that he had founded
a new science: "Mendelian genetics".
Mendel had supposed that there were
some sort of objects in organisms that con¬
trolled the individual physical characteristics
of those organisms; and that these objects
were passed on from parents to children. In
1879, a German scientist, Walther Flemm-
ing, discovered thé tiny chromosomes inside
the nuclei of cells. Once Mendelian genetics
was re-discovered, it was quickly seen that
the chromosomes were passed on from
parents to young and that this took place in
such a way as to account for the manner in
which characteristics were inherited. The
chromosome was considered to consist of a
string of "genes", each of which controlled
some particular characteristic.
These genes consisted of large molecules
of "nucleic acid" which produced replicas
of themselves each time a cell divided. Each
new cell thus had the characteristics of those
from which it arose.
However, the replica was not always pro¬
duced perfectly. Tiny accidental changes
might be introduced in the molecule. These
changes are called "mutations". It is the
mutations that produce the differences bet¬
ween one individual and another. It is the
mutations that are responsible for the in¬
born variations among the young that make
natural selection possible. Natural selection
allows some mutations to flourish and
others to die out, and as different mutations
survive here and there, new species form.

Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants have entered the
history of science. He started by crossing a pure-bred tall variety of
pea with a pure-bred short variety. As the diagram above shows, all
the first generation offspring were tall, because, although each plant
carried both a tall character gene (A) and a short character gene (a),
the tall character gene (A) was dominant. Of the second generation
offspring, however, about a quarter inherited only the short
character gene (a) and thus the pure-bred short variety recurred in
one out of four cases.
By 1927, an American scientist, Hermann
Müller, showed how one might actually pro¬
duce mutations by bombarding organisms
with X rays, which change the atomic ar¬
rangement in the genes. In 1953, an
American, James Watson, and an
Englishman, Francis Crick, explained the
detailed structure of nucleic acids, and
showed how a particular molecule produced
its own replica and how it might make a
mistake in doing so.
All this strengthened and improved the
Darwinian theory of evolution by natural
selection.
Meanwhile, since Darwin's time, more
and more fossils have been found, and more
and more has been learned about the
behaviour of living organisms and their in¬
fluence on each other. The actual details of
evolution which organisms descended
from which and through what kind of in¬
termediate stepsbecame better known.
In addition, it was found that natural
selection did not always work with
mechanical certainty; there were other fac¬
tors involved.
For instance, chance played a greater part
than might have been thought. Where there
were small populations of a particular
species, it might be that mutations that
weren't particularly useful would be
established just because a few lucky breaks
insured that those individuals possessing
those mutations would happen to survive.
In fact, nowadays some scientists, such as
Stephen Gould, are thinking in terms of
evolution that proceeds very slowly most of
the time, but quite quickly under excep¬
tional circumstances.
When there is a huge population of a
species, it may be that no mutation can
establish itself against the existence of
numerous individuals with other mutations.
What's more, a few lucky breaks this way or
that wouldn't be enough to push evolution
in one direction or another. The species
might then continue without much in the
way of change for many millions of years.
On the other hand, if a rather small
population ofthat species is isolated in a dif¬
ficult environment, it becomes much more
possible that sheer chance will cause some
mutations to die out among them
altogether, while others survive in con¬
siderable numbers. Under such conditions,
evolution will be faster and new species may
be formed in merely thousands of years.
It is these intervals of rapid change that
might be the chief agent for driving evolu¬
tion forward.
As things stand in 1982, then, we can
summarize the status of biological evolution
as follows :
1) Just about all scientists are convinced
that biological evolution has taken place
over a period of billions of years, and that
all present species, including human beings,
have developed from other species that ex¬
isted earlier.
' 2) Just about all scientists are convinced
that the manner in which biological evolu¬
tion has taken place is essentially that
described by Charles Darwin; that natural
selection among inborn variations is the
basic key.
3) Scientists who study evolution
nowadays are in deep disagreement on some
of the details of the evolutionary machinery,
and we cannot yet tell which side will win
out in these disputes. However, whichever
side wins, that will not affect the general ac¬
ceptance of Darwinian theory, along with its
modern improvements, as the basic descrip¬
tion of how life developed on earth.

THE VOYAGE
OF THE BEAGLE
Prelude
On September 11th (1831) I paid a flying visit with Fitzroy to the
Beagle at Plymouth. On December 27th the Beagle finally left the
shores of England for her circumnavigation of the world (...).
These two months at Plymouth were the most miserable which I
ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways. I was out of
spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends for so
long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy. I
was also troubled with palpitations and pain about the heart, and
like many a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering
of medical knowledge, was convinced that I had heart-disease. I
did not consult any doctor, as I fully expected to hear the verdict
that I was not fit for the voyage, and I was resolved to go at all
hazards.
(Darwin, Autobiography)
The departure
After having been twice driven back by heavy south-western
gales, Her Majesty's ship Beagle, a ten-gun brig, under the com¬
mand of Captain Fitzroy, RN, sailed from Devonport on
27 December 1831. The object of the expedition was to complete
the survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under
Captain King in 1826 to 1830; to survey the shores of Chile, Peru,
and of some islands in the Pacific; and to carry a chain of
chronometrical measurements round the world.

Nobody who has only been to sea for 24 hours has a right to say
that sea-sickness is even uncomfortable. The real misery only
begins when you are so exhausted that a little exertion makes a feel¬

raisins, which is the only food that the stomach will bear. On the

was a heavy sea running and the Island lay to Windward it was not
thought worth while to bear up to it. It afterwards has turned out it
was lucky we saved ourselves the trouble: I was much too sick even
to get up to see the distant outline.
(Darwin, letter to his father, 8 February 1832)
At noon lat. 43 South of Cape Finisterre and across the famous
Bay of Biscay: wretchedly out of spirits and very sick. I often said
before starting that I had no doubt I should frequently repent of
the whole undertaking. Little did I think with what fervour I
should do so. I can scarcely conceive any more miserable state than
when such dark and gloomy thoughts are haunting the mind as
have today pursued me.
(Darwin, Diary, 30 December 1831)
Darwin is a very sensible, hard-working man and a very pleasant
messmate. I never saw a "shore-going fellow" come into the ways
of a ship so soon and so thoroughly as Darwin. I cannot give a
stronger proof of his good sense and disposition than by saying
"Everyone respects and likes him" (...).
(Captain Fitzroy, letter to Captain Beaufort, 5 March 1832)
Crossing the line
We have crossed the Equator, and I have undergone the
disagreeable operation of being shaved. About 9 o'clock this mor¬
ning we poor "griffins", two and thirty in number, were put
altogether on the lower deck. The hatchways were battened down,
so we were in the dark and very hot. Presently four of Neptune's
constables came to us, and one by one led us up on deck. I was the
first and escaped easily; I nevertheless found this watery ordeal suf¬
ficiently disagreeable. Before coming up, the constable blindfolded
me and thus led along, buckets of water were thundered all
around; I was then placed on a plank, which could be easily tilted
up into a large bath of water. They then lathered my face and
mouth with pitch and paint, and scraped some of it off with a piece
of roughened iron hoop: a signal being given I was tilted head over
heels into the water, where two men received me and ducked me.
At last, glad enough, I escaped: most of the others were treated
much worse: dirty mixtures being put in their mouths and rubbed
on their faces. The whole ship was a shower bath, and water was
flying about in every direction: of course not one person, even the
Captain, got clear of being wet through.
(Darwin, Diary, 17 February 1832)
The Captain
And now for the Captain, as I daresay you feel some interest in
him. As far as I can judge, he is a very extraordinary person. I
never before came across a man whom I could fancy being a
Napoleon or a Nelson. I should not call him clever, yet I feel con¬
vinced nothing is too great or too high for him. His ascendancy
over everybody is quite curious: the extent to which every officer
and man feels the slightest rebuke or praise would have been,
before seeing him, incomprehensible. His candor and sincerity are
to me unparalleled: and using his own words his "vanity and
petulance" are nearly so. I have felt the effects of the latter: but
then bringing into play the former ones so forcibly makes one
hardly regret them. His greatest fault as a companion is his austere
silence, produced from excessive thinking: his many good qualities

are great and numerous: altogether he is the strongest marked
character I ever fell in with.
(Darwin, letter to his sister Caroline, dated 25 April 1832)
The Tropics
Decidedly the most striking thing in the Tropics is the novelty of
the vegetable forms. Cocoa nuts could well be imagined from
drawings if you add to them a graceful lightness which no Euro¬
pean tree partakes of. Bananas and Plantains are exactly the same
as those in hothouses; the acacias or tamarinds are striking from
[the] blueness of their foliage: but of the glorious orange trees no
description, no drawings, will give any just idea: instead of the
sickly green of our oranges, the native ones exceed the portugal
laurel in the darkness of their tint and infinitely exceed it in beauty
of form. Cocoa-nuts, Papaws, the light-green Bananas and
oranges loaded with fruit generally surrounded the more luxuriant
villages. Whilst viewing such scenes, one feels the impossibility that
any description should come near the mark, much less be over¬
drawn.
(Darwin, letter to his father, 26 February 1832)
I can only add raptures to the former raptures. I walked with the
two mids, a few miles into the interior. The country is composed of
small hills, and each new valley is more beautiful than the last. I
collected a great number of brilliantly-coloured flowers, enough to
make a florist go wild.- Brazilian scenery is nothing more nor less
than a view in the Arabian Nights, with the advantage of reality.
The air is deliciously cool and soft; full of enjoyment, one fervently
desires to live in retirement in this new and grander world...
(Darwin, Diary, 1 March 1832)
During our stay at Brazil I made a large collection of insects. A
few general observations on the comparative importance of the dif¬
ferent orders may be interesting to the English entomologist. The
large and brilliantly-coloured Lepidoptera bespeak the zone they
inhabit far more plainly than any other race of animals. I allude
only to the butterflies, for the moths, contrary to what might have
been expected from the rankness of the vegetation, certainly ap¬
peared in much fewer numbers than in our own temperate regions.
I was much surprised at the habits of Papilio feronia. This butter¬
fly is not uncommon, and generally frequents the orange-groves.
Although a high flier, yet it very frequently alights on the trunks of
trees. On these occasions its head is invariably placed downwards;
and its wings are expanded in a horizontal plane, instead of being
folded vertically, as is commonly the case. This is the only butterfly
which I have ever seen that uses its legs for running.
(Darwin, Journal, April 1832)
I find the peep of Tropical scenery has given me a tenfold wish to
see more; it is no exaggeration to say, no one can know how
beautiful the world we inhabit is, who has only been in the colder
climes. The chief source of pleasure has been to me, during these
two months, from Nat. history. I have been wonderfully lucky with
fossil bones some of the animals must have been of great dimen¬
sions: I am almost sure that many of them are quite new; this is
always pleasant, but with the antediluvian animals it is doubly so. I
found parts of the curious osseous coat, which is attributed to the
Megatherium; as the only specimens in Europe are at Madrid
(originally in 1798 from Buenos Ayres) this alone is enough to
repay some wearisome minutes. Amongst living animals I have not
been less fortunate. I also had in September some good sporting; I
shot one day a fine buck and doe, but in this line I never enjoyed
anything so much as Ostrich hunting with the wild Soldiers, who
are more than half Indians. They catch them by throwing two
balls, which are attached to the ends of a thong, so as to entangle
their legs: it was a fine animated chase.
(Darwin, letter to his sister Caroline, 24 October 1832)
Tierra del Fuego
I will describe our first arrival in Tierra del Fuego. A little after
noon we doubled Cape St Diego, and entered the famous Strait of
Le Maire. We kept close to the Fuegian shore, but the outline of
the rugged, inhospitable Statenland was visible amidst the clouds.
In the afternoon we anchored in the Bay of Good Success. While
20
entering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of
this savage land. A group of Fuegians partly concealed by the en¬
tangled forest, were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea;
and as we passed by, they sprang up and, waving their tattered
cloaks, sent forth a loud and sonorous shout. The harbour consists
of a line piece of water half-surrounded by low, rounded moun¬
tains of clay-slate, which are covered to the water's edge by one
dense gloomy forest. A single glance at the landscape was sufficient
to show me how widely different it was from any thing I had ever
beheld.
In the morning the Captain sent a party to communicate with the
Fuegians (...).
The chief spokesman was old, and appeared to be the head of
the family; the three others were powerful young men, about six
feet high. The women and children had been sent away. These
Fuegians are a very different race from the stunted, miserable
wretches farther westward; and they seem closely allied to the
famous Patagonians of the Strait of Magellan. Their only garment
consists of a mantle made of guanaco skin, with the wool outside;
this they wear just thrown over their shoulders, leaving their per¬
sons as often exposed as covered. Their skin is of a dirty coppery-
red colour.

The next day I attempted to penetrate some way into the coun¬
try. Tierra del Fuego may be described as a mountainous land,
partly submerged in the sea, so that deep inlets and bays occupy the
place where valleys should exist. The mountain sides, except on the
exposed western coast, are covered from the water's edge upwards
by one great forest. The trees reach to an elevation of between
1,000 and 1,500 feet, and are succeeded by a band of peat, with
minute alpine plants; and this again is succeeded by the line of
perpetual snow, which, according to Captain King, in the Strait of
Magellan "descends to between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. To find an acre
of level land in any part of the country is most rare. I recollect only
one little flat piece near Port Famine, and another of rather larger
extent near Goeree Road. In both places, and everywhere else, the
surface is covered by a thick bed of swampy peat. Even within the
forest, the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying
vegetable matter, which, from being soaked with water, yields to
the foot.
(Darwin, Journal, 17 December 1832)
climate, where gale succeeds gale, with rain, hail, and sleet, seems
blacker than anywhere else. In the Strait of Magellan, looking due
southward from Port Famine, the distant channels between the
mountains appeared from their gloominess to lead beyond the con¬
fines of this world.
(Darwin, Journal, 20 December 1832)
The Andes
The appearance of the Andes was different from what I ex¬
pected; the lower line of the snow was of course horizontal, and to
this line the even summits of the range appeared quite parallel. At
long intervals, a mass of points or a single cone showed where a
Volcano had or does now exist. It hence looked more like a wall,
than a range of separate mountains, and made a most complete
barrier to the country.
(Darwin, Diary, 17 August 1834)
There was a degree of mysterious grandeur in mountain behind
mountain, with the deep intervening valleys, all covered by one
thick, dusky mass of forest. The atmosphere, likewise, in this
The descent on the eastern side of the Cordillera is much shorter
or steeper than on the Pacific side; in other words, the mountains
rise more abruptly from the plains, than from the alpine country of
Chile. A level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was extended

beneath our feet, and thus shut out the view of the equally level
Pampas. We soon entered the band of clouds, and did not again
emerge from it that day. About noon, finding pasture for the
animals and bushes for firewood, in a part of the valley called Los
Arenales, we stopped for the night. This was near the uppermost
limit of bushes, and the elevation, I suppose, was between seven
and eight thousand feet.
I was very much struck with the marked difference between the
vegetation of these eastern valleys and that of the opposite side: yet
the climate, as well as the kind of soil, is nearly identical, and the
difference of longitude very trifling. The same remark holds good
with the quadrupeds, and in a lesser degree with the birds and in¬
sects. We must except certain species which habitually or occa¬
sionally frequent elevated mountains; and in the case of the birds,
certain kinds, which have a range as far south as the Strait of
Magellan. This fact is in perfect accordance with the geological
history of the Andes; for these mountains have existed as a great
barrier, since a period so remote that whole races of animals must
subsequently have perished from the face of the earth. Therefore,
unless we suppose the same species to have been created in two dif¬
ferent countries, we ought not to expect any closer similarity bet¬
ween the organic beings on opposite sides of the Andes, than on
shores separated by a broad strait of the sea. In both cases we must
leave out of the question those kinds which have been able to cross
ithe barrier, whether of salt water or solid rock (1).
(Darwin, Narrative, 23 March 1835)
(1) This is merely an illustration of the admirable laws first laid down by
Mr Lyell of the geographical distribution of animals as influenced by
geological changes. The whole reasoning, of course, is founded on the
assumption of the immutability of species. Otherwise the changes might be
considered as superinduced by different circumstances in the two regions
during a length of time.
The ladies of Lima
There are two things in Lima which all Travellers have discussed;
the ladies tapadas, or concealed in the saya y manta, and a fruit
called Chilimoya. To my mind the former is as beautiful as the lat¬
ter is delicious. The close elastic gown fits the figure closely and
obliges the ladies to walk with small steps, which they do very
elegantly and display very white silk stockings and very pretty feet.
They wear a black silk veil, which is fixed round the waist behind,
is brought over the head and held by the hands before the face,
allowing only one eye to remain uncovered. But then, that one eye
is so black and brilliant and has such powers of motion and expres¬
sion, that its effect is very powerful. Altogether the ladies are so
metamorphised, that I at first felt as much surprised as if I had
been introduced amongst a number of nice round mermaids, or
any other such beautiful animal. And certainly they are better
worth looking at than all the churches and buildings in Lima.
Secondly for the Chilimoya, which is a very delicious fruit, but the
flavour is about as difficult to describe, as it would be to a Blind
man some particular shade of colour; it is neither a nutritive fruit
like the Banana, a crude fruit like the Apple, or refreshing fruit like
the Orange or Peach, but it is a yery good and large fruit and that is
all I have to say about it.
(Darwin, Diary, 29 July 1835)
The Galapagos Islands
The natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and
well deserves attention. Most of the organic productions are
aboriginal creations, found nowhere else: there is even a difference
between the inhabitants of the different islands. Yet all show a
marked relationship with those of America though separated from
that continent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600
miles in width. The archipelago is a little world within itself, or
rather a satellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few
stray colonists, and has received the general character of its in¬
digenous productions. Considering the small size of these islands,
we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal be¬
ings, and at their confined range. Seeing every height crowned with
its crater, and the boundaries of most of the lava-streams still
distinct, we are led to believe that within a period, geologically re¬
cent, the unbroken ocean was here spread out. Hence, both in
space and time, we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great
factthat mystery of mysteriesthe first appearance of new be¬
ings on this earth...
(Darwin, Journal, 8 October 1835)
I industriously collected all the animals, plants, insects and rep¬
tiles from this Island. It will be very interesting to find from future
comparison to what district or "centre of creation" the organized
beings of this archipelago must be attached (...).
(Darwin, Diary, 26, 27 September 1835)
When I recollect, the fact that the form of the body, shape of
scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce, from
which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see
these Islands in sight of each other, and possessed of but a scanty
stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in
structure and filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they
are only varieties. The only fact of a similar kind of which I am
aware, is the constant asserted difference between the wolf-like Fox
of East and West Falkland Islds. If there is the slightest foundation
for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes will be well worth
examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of Species.

In my opinion, they are the finest men I have ever beheld; very
tall, broadshouldered, athletic, with their limbs well-proportioned.

Beagle's official artist for nine
months, depicts the scene at

sport and games. In the left
foreground a group of sailors
are playing a game called
"slinging the monkey". A crew
member, the "monkey", is
slung by his feet from a tripod.
In his hand he holds a piece of
chalk. Other seamen gathered
round flick at the "monkey"
with twisted handkerchiefs.
Meanwhile, the "monkey",
working up a swinging motion,,
attempts to mark one of his
comrades with the chalk. When
he succeeds, the person so
marked takes his place as the

the Beagle and the Adventure

for authenticity. The pencilled
note at the bottom, in the Cap¬
tain's hand, which reads "Note

farther aft. Miz. Mast to rake
more", shows that Fitzroy was
not entirely happy with the
artist's positioning of the
Beagle's masts.

skin more pleasing and natural to the eye of an European than his

Sydney
Here we arrived on the 12th of this month. On entering the har¬
bor we were astounded with all the appearances of the outskirts of
a great city: numerous Windmills Forts large stone white hou¬
ses, superb Villas, etc., etc. (...).
From Sydney we go to Hobart Town, from there to King George
Sound, and then adieu to Australia. From Hobart town being
superadded to the list of places I think we shall not reach England
before September: But thank God the Captain is as home sick as I
am, and I trust he will rather grow worse than better. He is busy in
getting his account of the voyage in a forward state for publication
(...).
From K. George Sound to Isle of France, C. of Good Hope, St
Helena, Ascension, and omitting the C. Verds on account of the
unhealthy season, to the Azores and then England. To this last
stage I hourly look forward with more and more intense delight; I
try to drive into my stupid head Maxims of patience and common
sense, but that head is too full of affection for all of you to allow
such dull personages to enter.
(Darwin, letter to his sister Susan, 28 January 1836)
The homecoming
On the last day of August [1836], we anchored for the second
time at Proto Praya in the Cape de Verd archipelago; thence we
proceeded to the Azores, where we staid six days. On the 2nd of
October we made the shores of England; and at Falmouth I left the
Beagle, having lived on board the good little vessel nearly five
years.
(Darwin, Journal)
The voyage of the Beagle has been by far the most important
event in my life and has determined my whole career (...).
I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the first real training
or education of my mind. I was led to attend closely to several
branches of natural history, and thus my powers of observation
were improved, though they were already fairly developed (...).
Looking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science
gradually preponderated over every other taste. During the first
two years my old passion for shooting survived in nearly full force,
and I shot myself all the birds and animals for my collection; but
gradually I gave up my gun more and more, and finally altogether
to my servant, as shooting interfered with my work, more espe¬
cially with making out the geological structure of a country. I dis¬
covered, though unconsciously and insensibly, that the pleasure of
observing and reasoning was a much higher one than that of skill
and sport. The primeval instincts of the barbarian slowly yielded to
the acquired tastes of the civilized man.

THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS
The origin of 'The Origin'
by Jorge Enrique Adoum
IT was in the Galapagos Islands that
Darwin became truly "Darwinian."
When he set sail on the Beagle as a
naturalist in 1831, he was only twenty-two
years old and a fervent believer. At the age
of nineteen he had entered Christ's College,
Cambridge, with the vague intention of go¬
ing into the Church. In his Autobiography
he would say of that period: "I did not then
in the least doubt the strict and literal truth
of every word in the Bible." Consequently,
there could be no doubt that the world had
been created in six days (during the year
4004 BC, according to the calculations of
Archbishop James Ussher; being com¬
pleted, if further precision is needed,
at 9 o'clock in the morning of Saturday
12 October).
He was first assailed by doubts during his
voyage to South America: he found "new"
fossils; he discovered that on either side of
the Andes different types of vegetation grew
in similar climates and on similar soils; he
also found vast coral or lava concretions of
later formation than that of the cordillera.
He noted that the Galapagos Islands, form¬
ed as a result of successive eruptions of sub¬
marine volcanoes, were geologically more
recent than Americathat is, subsequent to
the creation. Moreover they were quite
separate, without any sunken ridges that
might once have joined them to the con¬
tinental shelf. He dubbed them "Satellites
of the continent."
"Nothing could be less inviting than the
first appearance..." he wrote in his diary,
"a broken field of black basaltic lava,
thrown into the most rugged waves and
crossed by great fissures." The winds and
waves had sculpted blocks smooth as the
walls of natural fortresses, perforated cliffs
like sponges, grooved surfaces like the
fossilized tresses of a giantess on the rocks
that rose from the underwater quarries.
And, scattered on or between the islands,
JORGE ENRIQUE ADOUM, Ecuadorian poet
and writer, has published several volumes of
poetry, including an anthology. No son todos los
que están. Poemas 1949-1979 (Seix Barral,
Barcelona, 1980). His play about the Spanish
conquest of the Inca empire, published in English
as The Sun Trampled Beneath the Horses'
Hooves (The Massachusetts Review, Winter-
Spring 1974) has also been translated into
French, Swedish and Polish and performed in
several countries of Europe and Latin America.
He has taken part in Unesco's programme of
studies on Latin American cultures, and is now a
member of the editorial staff of the Unesco
Courier.

innumerable boulders lay like broken teeth,
molars with lakes of lava at the bottom of
their caries. We would call it a lunar land¬
scape; Darwin described it thus: "I scarcely
hesitate to affirm that there must be in the
whole archipelago at least 2,000 craters." A
few of these volcanoes have continued to be
active and there have been eruptions until
recently. An aerial view of the largest island,
Isabela, shows that it is formed of lava flows
from five or six volcanoes which were once
separated by the sea. And on these edges of
rugged basalt are fearsome marine iguanas
of antediluvian aspect, slow-moving land ig¬
uanas "of singularly stupid appearance",
the giant land tortoises known in Spanish as
galápagos, so sluggish as to give the impres¬
sion that they can hardly cope with their
own weight. "A shore fit for
pandemonium" was the entry Captain
Robert Fitzroy made in the logbook of the
Beagle on the day of its arrival,
15 September 1835.
The islands date back to a little over a
million years. The winds blowing from the
continent and the waves rolling to and fro
between the beaches and the offshore rocks
must have brought the particles of earth and
spores of lichen and fern that were the
basalt's first colonizers. Then came the birds
bearing seeds among their feathers, in their
stomachs or on their feet. The Humboldt
Current must also have brought other
animal species such as penguins, clinging to
driftwood, to these islands which stretch
from one degree north to two degrees south.
These must have been the earliest in¬
habitants of the archipelago, which lies just
under 1,000 kilometres off the coast of
Ecuador and has a total land area of ap¬
proximately 7,800 square kilometres. The
largest island comprises more than half the
total land area, with 4,588 square kilo¬
metres, while the smallest covers barely five.
A few pieces of pottery and Thor Heyer-
dahl's Kon Tiki expedition have led some
people to suggest that the Galapagos had
been reached by pre-Columbian inhabitants
of South America, in particular, the Incas.
However, history records that it was the
Spanish Bishop of Panama, Tomás de
Berlanga, who was sent by the Emperor
17 September 1835. "In the morning we
landed on Chatham Island [Isla San
Cristóbal]... Nothing could be less inviting
than the first appearance. A barren field of
black basaltic lava, thrown into the most
rugged waves and crossed by great
fissures..." (Darwin, The Voyage of the
Beagle).
Charles V to arbitrate in the conflict bet¬
ween the conquistadores Francisco Pizarro
and Diego de Almagra, who discovered the
archipelago in 1535. It is possible that he
was blown off-course, or that his ship was
driven towards the islands by the mighty
Humboldt Current. Berlanga and his crew
were certainly the first to call the islands the
Galapagos, and also the Islas Encantadas
(Bewitched Islands) because of the mist that
enveloped them like castles in a fairy tale.
The islands were of no interest to the con¬
quistadores, but they were an ideal lair for
pirates: there, freebooters and buccaneers
set up their bases for operations against the
galleons returning treasure-laden to
metropolitan Spain. The area was fre¬
quented by adventurers such as Knight,
Captain Morgan, Davis and Ambrose
Cawley, who drew the first navigation
charts on which the islands appear. Around
1800, Captain Collnet of the Royal Navy
suggested fishing the whales which abound¬
ed around the archipelago, since those of
the Atlantic had been virtually exter¬
minated. From then onwards, English and
North American whalers recklessly
plundered the surrounding waters, depleting
not only the stocks of cetaceans but also the
tortoises that were so prized for their flesh
and oil alike. A single boat would take up to
fourteen tons of tortoises in four days and,
according to the U.S. Navy's nineteenth-
century archives, in twenty-seven years its
whaling fleet caught over 13,000 of these
mammals which, left alone, could live for
more than two centuries. (In 1841 the
islands were also visited by a whaler, sub¬
sequently a celebrated writer, Herman
Melville, who described them in a fine work
entitled The Encantadas. Even more signifi¬
cant, however, is the fact that in the early
nineteenth century the North American
whaler Essex was attacked and sunk by a
sperm whale 30 degrees west of the
Galapagos. This was the origin of Moby
Dick, the white whale, incarnation of Evil
on Sea and Land, and the vengeful and
bloody persecution of Captain Ahab with
his wooden leg and his epic failure.
On Charles Island (now Santa Maria)
Darwin found a settlement of two or three
hundred inhabitants, "Nearly all people of
colour who have been banished for political
crimes from the Republic of the Equator".
Ecuador had taken possession of the islands
on 12 February 1832 and called them the
Archipiélago de Colón (the "Columbus Ar¬
chipelago"), and gave them Christian names
connected with the life of the illustrious Ad¬
miral: Isabela and Fernandina (after the
Catholic Kings who had sponsored the ac-K

The convicts, who were not necessarily all
political offenders, had been taken to the
islands by General José de Villamil, along
with a handful of farmers and possibly a few
craftsmen. The boat was a Noah's Ark in
miniature, since the deportees took along
dogs, pigs, goats, asses, cats and hens,
which in turn attracted rats and fleas. On
Santa Maria, people who had obtained con¬
cessions to exploit chinchillas harassed the
settlers and convicts, so that by 1845 only
twenty-five of the latter were left, twelve in
1851, and eventually none at all.

5,000 persons divided among three islands
inhabit an area comprising one tenth of the
total land area (the rest has been declared a
National Park) and grow potatoes, lemons
and coffee. On the higher ground small
26
plains have formed where animal husbandry
has begun. However, the acute shortage of
water (provided only by a few springs and
the persistent drizzle) the distance, as well as
transport difficulties make both farming
and animal husbandry an unprofitable oc¬
cupation. Regular tourism is relatively new.
(As recently as thirty years ago only one
boat left the port of Guayaquil every four or
six months with water, food, ropes, candles,
matches and mail. The San Cristóbal "post
office" consisted of a barrel sheltered from
the drizzle by an improvised roof.)
Darwin encountered a veritable
laboratory of evolution in the archipelago.
And since "there is even a difference bet¬
ween the inhabitants of the different
islands", he was able to observe not only the
final product of the long evolutionary pro¬
cess, but also its different phases such as the
thickening of the finches' beaks and the
lengthening of the necks of the giant tor¬
toises. "Most of the organic productions are
aboriginal creations found nowhere else..."
Originally the tortoises on the Galapagos
all belonged to the same species, later
dividing into fifteen subspecies comprising
three groups, according to the form of their
shells. The shells of those on Española,
Pinzón, Pinta, Fernandina and part of
Isabela are shaped like a saddle, with the
front edge raised to enable them to stretch
their necks to reach the tall cacti on which
they feed. Those on Santa Cruz have round¬
ed shells and shorter necks and limbs, since
they feed on plants which do not grow high.
Between these two species there is a third
which includes numerous variants according
to size and the form of their shells.
The type of food they eat also determines
how frequently these animals, the oldest liv¬
ing creatures on the planet, move in slow
procession to the few springs of the uplands
where each "buries his head in the water
above his eyes and greedily swallows great
mouthfuls, at the rate of about ten a
minute. The inhabitants say each animal
stays three or four days in the
neighbourhood of the water and then
returns to the lower country". Darwin sup¬
posed that this was why the tortoise needed
to develop a bladder similar to the frog's
which acts as a store-house for the moisture
it needs in order to survive. Although some^

of these species seem to be extinct and in
some cases attempts at cross-breeding bet¬
ween the sole surviving specimens of dif¬
ferent groups have met with failure large
colonies still subsist, especially on Santa
Cruz and Isabela.
According to Darwin, the islanders claim¬
ed that the tortoises were deaf, because they
are indifferent to the presence of human be¬
ings. The same may be said of all the species
of the Galapagos, in particular the marine
iguana. These creatures sun themselves in
serried groups on the rocks some distance
from the water. One seemingly substan¬
tiated hypothesis has it that this crested
animal, monstrous in appearance if not in
size, with its serrated back and powerful
claws, as if to enable it to cling to the
ground, must have originally led the same
sort of existence as the land iguanas.
However, in order to escape from the land
iguana, which belonged to a more powerful
race, the marine iguana needed to acquire
aquatic skills, although Darwin himself
pointed out that once the danger is past it
shuns the water. Consequently, it had to
change its eating habits and, in order to
eliminate the large quantities of salt it ab¬
sorbs from the sea-weed on which it feeds, it
possesses massive glands which enable it to
eliminate the salt through its nose, thus sup¬
plementing the task of the kidneys. The sud¬
den temperature changes caused by plung¬
ing from hot rocks into the cool water, and
then returning back to land, have modified
the rate of its heartbeat; laboratory ex¬
periments have shown that it loses heat
about half as quickly as it regains it when
the ambient temperature is raised or
lowered. When Darwin visited San Salvador
island there were so many land iguanas that
he had difficulty in pitching his tent, the soil
was so uneven on account of their holes.
The Galapagos penguin is the only one of
its kind to have ventured so near the
equinoctial line. It is also the smallest in the
world, almost like a clumsy child, or a dwarf
in comparison with its arrogant ancestors or
its contemporaries in Antarctica. But in the
archipelago, as if obeying some collective or
ancestral memory, it seeks the deep, cold
waters between the islands of Fernandina
and Isabela, and on land it shelters in the
cool of the hollows worn in the lava by the
waves.
Of the thirteen known species of
albatross, the species found on Española
(Diomedea irrorata), is the only one in the
world that inhabits the tropics. Likewise,
the masked booby of the Galapagos is the
only member of its family that has an an¬
nual reproduction cycle, although this varies
from island to island; on Genovesa it runs
from August to November, and on
Española from November to February. Like
the blue-footed booby, it lays its eggs direct¬
ly on the ground, having lost the habit of
nest-building, probably due to the scarcity
of trees and the absence of animals and
birds of prey on the coasts where they live.
From the two eggs it lays, however, it only
succeeds in rearing one chick: the other, less
favoured, is doomed to die of hunger within
a few days.
The lava heron and the flightless cor¬
morant constitute unusual examples of
adaptation to this environment. The
former, which is only found in the
Galapagos, unlike most herons, sometimes
perches atop an overhanging bush before
diving into the water below. The flightless
cormorant, on the other hand, whose
ancestors must have flown almost 1,000
kilometres to the islands, has practically lost
its wing feathers. It was so easy to catch fish
that it forgot how to fly and learned to swim
instead. The fact that it is the only flightless
bird in the archipelago is additional proof
that the Galapagos are a young formation.
So far, only one species has had the time to
lose the use of its wings, whereas in New
Zealand, for instance, several species have
undergone this atrophy.
The case of the finch has become classic
since Darwin used it as one of the pivotal
arguments for his theory on natural selec¬
tion. Observing the difference in the
thickness of the beaks of the different
species, he concluded that in the course of
many generations the finches had to adapt
their beaks to the size of the grains, seeds,
insects and even leaves on which they
depended for food. Of the thirteen species
listed, the most interesting is the
woodpecker finch which searches for insects
and their larvae in the cracks of the bark of
the lignum vitae, called "palo santo"
because of the perfume it gives off when
cut, or in the hollows of dead trees. But, as
its beak is not sufficiently long, it uses a cac¬
tus thorn to poke into the cracks, thus being
the only known case of a bird using a tool to
obtain food.
Almost all the reptiles, half of the seden¬
tary birds, a third of the vegetation and a
large proportion of the insects of the
Galapagos exist nowhere else in the world.
Hence Darwin considered that his voyage to
South America, and especially to the
Galapagos, was by far the most important
event in his life and that in these islands lay
the origin for "all his ideas". He wrote in
his diary that here "both in space and time,
we seem to be brought somewhat near to
that great fact the mystery of mys¬
teries the first appearance of new beings
on this earth".
More than man himself, it is the domestic
animals he brought with him to the ar¬
chipelago that endanger the survival of the
aboriginal animal populations. Something
similar is also occurring with respect to the
plant species. Wild dogs devour the tortoises
and iguanas; the goats flatten' the vegeta¬
tion; eggs and baby animals are the
favourite food of the wild pigs. A 1963
report from the Charles Darwin Research
Station states that on the island of Española
"only one tortoise was found... during a
two-day search made by three men. The
island's vegetation has been severely
devastated by goats; when the tortoise was
found it was eating in the company of, and
in competition with fifteen goats". In any
event, indirectly, the most serious threat to
the preservation of these species is, as the
English playwright Tom Stoppard has put
it, that in the Galapagos "the animals are in
a state of innocence. They have no idea that
you and I are, as the biologists put it, the
most successful of the species, and that we
could choose to wipe them out if we did not
choose to cherish them; and so they are not
afraid... One walks among iguanas, herons,
doves, mocking-birds and finches as Adam
and Eve in medieval paintings walk among
antelopes and cranes".

UNESCO AND THE CHARLES DARWIN FOUNDATION
IN 1935 the Government of Ecuador marked the centenary of
Darwin's visit to the Galapagos Islands by establishing a na¬
ture reserve on most of the uninhabited islands. Today the
"Galapagos Natural Park" covers 690,000 hectares, nine-tenths of
the total area of the archipelago. In 1937, Julian Huxley, later to be
Unesco's first Director-General, headed an international
"Galapagos Islands Committee", but the Committee's plans to
establish a research station in the archipelago were interrupted by
the Second World War. In 1957, the plan was revived and endorsed
by Unesco and, in 1959, the centenary year of the publication of
The Origin of Species, the Charles Darwin Foundation for the
Galapagos Islands was created in Brussels under the auspices of
Unesco and the International Union for the Conservation of
Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). During the early 1960s, the
first buildings of the Charles Darwin Research Station were erected
near Puerto Ayora, on Santa Cruz island, with support from the
Government of Ecuador, Unesco, IUCN, the United Nations
Development Programme, and the Smithsonian Institution. The
Foundation has drawn up a "Master Plan for the Galapagos Na-
28
tional Park". In accordance with the Plan young tortoises are
reared at the station and released in their natural habitat when they
are 3 years old and can defend themselves against their enemies. Ig¬
uana are protected in the same way. Thousands of young fur seals
(formerly believed doomed to extinction) have been saved, and
measures have been taken to protect all the species from wild dogs
and goats. The Government of Ecuador has adopted the Plan's
recommendations for the limitation and control of tourism. No
more than 5,000 visitors (usually accommodated on board the ship
which brought them to the islands) are allowed, private visits are
prohibited, and fishing is controlled. Conducted tours are led by
trained guides along signposted footpaths. Feeding the animals is
prbhibited and each visitor is provided with a plastic bag for refuse
disposal. The Foundation plans to include marine areas in the Na¬
tional park and Unesco is contributing to the creation of a marine
laboratory which will also carry out geological studies. The
Galapagos National Park has been included in the World Heritage
List of cultural and natural properties of "outstanding universal
value".

Every plant belongs to a species.
These plants have several features in common, but they can be
divided into five different species. Chives (Allium
schoenoprasum) grow in clumps, and have narrow bulbs and
narrow leaves. Ramsons (Allium ursinum) grow in clumps, and
have narrow bulbs and broad leaves. Leeks (Allium porrum) grow
singly, and have long cylindrical bulbs. Onions (Allium cepa)
grow singly, have round bulbs, and their flower stalks are
swollen. Garlic {Allium sativum) grow singly, have round bulbs,
and their flower stalks are not swollen.

Although they look almost identical, chiffchaffs and willow

apart is to listen to their song. But once you know they are
different, you can sometimes see small differences between
them.
THE EVOLUTION
OF EVOLUTION
by Pierre Thuillier
PIERRE THUILLIER, professor of the history of
science at the University of Lille III and the
University of Paris VII, is a member of the
editorial staff of the French scientific periodical
La Recherche. His interests in epistemology (the
theory and science of knowledge) and the
broader questions of the relations between
science and society are reflected in his Jeux et
Enjeux de la Science (Games and Stakes of
Science) published by Robert Laffont, Paris,
1972. His most recent book, Darwin and Co., was
published last year by Editions Complexe.
WHEN we think of evolution now¬
adays, our minds turn automati¬
cally to Darwin. Was it not he
who, in the mid-nineteenth century, explain¬
ed once and for all how the various forms of
life had been constituted? But there is no
reason why Darwin and his famous book of
1859, The Origin ofSpecies, should blind us
to the long and eventful history of transfor-
mism: a history that started before him,
continued long after him, and is doubtless
not closed. Evolutionism, it has often been
said, has evolved. As the historical sketch he
added to The Origin of Species proves, Dar¬
win was aware of this.
He began the sketch by alluding to certain
writers of Antiquityand it is quite true
that some Greek philosophers had vaguely
surmised that living organisms might have
undergone transformation. In the sixth cen- I

Empedocles of Acragas, 490 - 430 BC Georges-Louis de Buffon, 1707 - 1788 Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, 1744 - 1829
iV tury BC, Anaximander of Miletus thought
that "man, at the origin, was born of
animals of another kind " . This was , he said ,
borne out by the fact that human children
take a long time before they can feed
themselves unaided. In the fifth century BC
another Greek thinker, Empedocles of
Acragas (now Agrigento) put forward
curious hypotheses about the development
of organisms: "heads without necks ap¬
peared on earth, arms wandered without
shoulders, and eyes with no forehead moved
hither and thither...". In his view, these
separate organs were brought together by
the influence of Love, and that was how liv¬
ing beings were formed. His work contains
the germs of a kind of natural selection: un¬
viable organisms (such as cows with human
heads!) became extinct, while those which
were properly formed survived.
This is why some historians have seen
Empedocles as a precursor of Dar¬
winism opinion that is difficult to sus¬
tain. A few authors of Antiquity, however,
had remarkable intuitions. Thus the Latin
poet and philosopher Lucretius, in the first
century BC, gave a very striking description
of the "struggle for life". He thought it
possible to account for the genesis of
animals by the laws of nature alone, without
invoking divine intervention. But however
interesting, such ideas were never
methodically or systematically developed,
and many centuries went by before more ex¬
act speculations were made. Not until the
eighteenth century did the first signs of
modern transformism appear.
The development of a sense of history
may well have played a part in the maturing
of new ideas in biology. Little by little,
theoreticians came to see social reality
(customs, institutions, culture) in evolu¬
tionist terms, and it is not too surprising that
this way of thinking should also have been
applied to the study of nature.
It should be remembered that Christianity
then dominated Western culture. According
to the most widespread interpretation of the
Bible, the different plant and animal species
had been created directly by God and were
immutable. It was a bold undertaking to at¬
tack that doctrine, especially since sciences
such as palaeontology and embryology were
still in their infancy. But a few bold spirits
ventured nevertheless to suggest that living
creatures might undergo "transmutations"
from generation to generation.
The French writer Benoît de Maillet, for
one, in a book published only after his death
in 1748, said that all the land species might
perhaps have come from corresponding
marine species. He suggested that fishes had
settled on the land and had given birth to
new animals, including birds. Similarly, sea
elephants had bred land elephants, and men
too had stemmed from sea creatures the
Tritons! Obviously Benoît de Maillet is now
seen as a gentle dreamer with an excessive
imagination. But around the same time,
other authors were formulating some highly
interesting ideas.
Science historians have noted, for in-
Darwin and racism
DESPITE the influence of certain thinkers, race pre¬
judice developed into a regular doctrinal system
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
There was indeed a relatively brief period when it appeared
as though the spread of the principles of the French and
American revolutions and the success of the anti-slavery
campaign in England might lessen or even abolish such pre¬
judice, but both the reaction which followed the Restora¬
tion and the industrial revolution in Europe at the beginn¬
ing of the last century had direct and damaging repercus¬
sions on the racial question. The development of power
spinning and weaving opened ever wider markets to cotton
manufacturers, and "Cotton was king", particularly in the
southern part of the United States. The result was an in¬
creasing demand for servile labour; slavery, which was
breaking down in America and might have vanished of
itself, automatically became a sacrosanct institution on
which the prosperity of the Cotton Belt depended. It was to
defend this so-called "special institution" that southern
thinkers and sociologists developed a complete pseudo-
scientific mythology designed to justify a state of affairs
contrary to the democratic beliefs they professed. For the
quietening of consciences men had to be persuaded that the
Black was not merely an inferior being to the White but
little different from the brutes.
The Darwinian theory of the survival of the fittest was
warmly welcomed by the whites as an argument supporting
and confirming their policy of expansion and aggression at
the expense of the ".inferior" peoples. As Darwin's theory
was made public in the years in which the greater powers
were building their colonial empires, it helped to justify
them in their own eyes and before the rest of mankind: i.e.
slavery or death brought to "inferior" human groups by
European rifles and machine-guns was no more than the

stance, that around the mid-eighteenth cen¬
tury, Pierre de Maupertuis appears "to have
had a fairly clear notion of the processes of
mutation and selection". In his view, not
only could living creatures change acciden¬
tally from generation to generation, but
useful changes could be preserved and ac¬
cumulate, while ill-adapted specimens, con¬
versely, were doomed to disappear.
For his part, the naturalist Buffon seems
to have accepted that a limited transformism
was possible. He even wrote that it might be
conjectured that "all animals have descend¬
ed from a single animal which has over the
ages, by improving and degenerating, pro¬
duced all the races of other animals". We
must beware of exaggerating the importance
of such statements. But clearly, by the eigh¬
teenth century many naturalists entertained
the proposition of the variability of the
species. Charles Darwin's own grandfather,
Erasmus Darwin, drew on various con¬
siderations taken from comparative
anatomy, embryology, etc. to formulate an
evolutionist theory. He is generally viewed
as a predecessor of Larmarck, who in 1809
published a particularly important work: the
Philosophie Zoologique, or Zoological
Philosophy.
Lamarck's thought is often summarized
as follows: in order to adapt to their en¬
vironment, animals acquire new physical
characters which are then hereditarily
transmitted to their descendants. The usual
example is the giraffe: in order to reach ever
higher leaves and to meet new "needs", it
adopted, or so the theory goes, the habit of
stretching its neck, and passed the resulting
change on to its offspring. But Lamarck's
theory is far more complex. He does indeed
accept that changing circumstances indirect¬
ly cause a kind of evolution, but he also
asserts that life itself, through its own laws,
causes as it were a "progression" in living
beings. In other words, nature tends spon¬
taneously to complicate the "general series
of animals": all in all, environmental varia¬
tions are, if anything, disruptive: they in
troduce "anomalies" into the "general
scheme of nature". Lamarck did not suc¬
ceed in convincing all his fellow-naturalists,
but he did exert a lasting influence even
when his system had been exposed to very
severe criticism.
During the first half of the nineteenth
century, other transformist interpretations
were put forward. Examples are the French¬
man Etienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and
the Englishman Robert Chambers, who
published in 1844 an anonymous book en¬
titled The Vestiges of the Natural History of
Creation. But there was nothing of the
nature of a breakthrough until the year
1858, when papers by Charles Darwin and
Alfred Rüssel Wallace were read to the Lin¬
nean Society of London, clearly setting out
the theory of natural selection. The follow¬
ing year, The Origin of Species was publish¬
ed. And this was a well-structured theory,
supported by a large number of specific ex¬
amples drawn from palaeontology, em¬
bryology, comparative anatomy and^
implementation of the theory of the replacement of an in¬
ferior by a superior human society. In international politics
racism excuses aggression, for the aggressor no longer feels
himself bound by any consideration for foreigners belong¬
ing to "inferior" races and classifiable little, if at all, above
the beasts.
The notion that the stronger is biologically and scien¬
tifically justified in destroying the weaker has been applied
as much to conflicts within as to those between nations.
It is unfair to level at Darwin as many have done the
reproach that he promoted this hateful and inhuman
theory. The truth is that with coloured societies becoming
potential competitors in the labour market and claiming the
social advantages regarded as exclusively the heritage of the
whites, the latter were obviously in need of some disguise
for the utter economic materialism which led them to deny
the "inferior" peoples any share in the privileges they
themselves enjoyed. For that reason they welcomed with
satisfaction Darwin's biological thesis and then by simplifica¬
tion, distortion and adaptation of it in conformity with their
own particular interests, transformed it into the so-called
"social Darwinism" on which they based their right to their
social and economic privileges; it is a thing which bears no
relationship to Darwin's purely biological principles. Herbert
Spencer (1820-1903) applied to sociology the concept of the
"survival of the fittest" and the same idea was used to de¬
fend Nietzsche's (1844-1900) doctrine of the "superman"
with whom "fittest" was equated.
In this way progress in biology was misused to provide
superficially scientific and simple solutions to allay scruples
on points of human conduct.

THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLUTION
biogeography, and providing a detailed ex¬
planation of the formation of species.
Darwin began by stating that the species
were populations made up of individuals
that could vary from generation to genera¬
tion. He then spoke of the continual "strug¬
gle for life" in nature: the animals, he said,
must not only face their competitors, but
must endure bad weather, heat, drought,
etc. He then brought in the idea of natural
selection, basing it on a comparison with ar¬
tificial selection: just as breeders improve
their stock through methodical selection, so
nature produced new species by selecting in¬
dividuals. Those which bore favourable
variations survived and multiplied, while
those which bore unfavourable variations
became extinct. Supposing that this
mechanism operated over thousands of
generations, Darwin said, then by
cumulative effects of tiny -changes, new
populations (meaning new species) would be
formed.
Darwin acknowledged that there were
several other evolutive processes such as sex¬
ual selection, use and non-use of organs and
the direct effect of circumstances. But in his
eyes, nautral selection played the principal
role. Properly speaking, as Darwin himself
recognized, the theory was not "proved". A
frequent objection, albeit one of many, was
that no species had ever been seen to change
into another. But Darwin was right to say
that his explanations made intelligible a host
of facts observed by specialists in palaeon¬
tology, embryology and other disciplines.
Several scientists opposed the new theory
but, in a few years, it won acceptance in very
many countries.
There were, however, weaknesses in Dar¬
winism. They were due in particular to the
fact that in Darwin's day, little was known
about genetics. Mendel's famous study of
hybrid plants, which marked the start of
modern genetics, was published only in
1865: Darwin never used the ideas it con¬
tained. But other scientists were soon to
undertake a revision of the theory expound¬
ed in The Origin of Species. While Dárwin
believed, for instance, in the heredity of ac¬
quired characters, the German August
Weismann, in the closing years of the cen¬
tury, asserted that such heredity was im¬
possible. That led to the rejection of the
concept of usage and non-usage of
organsbut the theory of natural selection
proper remained intact.
In 1900 there came a new development in
genetics thanks to the "rediscovery" of
Mendel's laws inspired by the Austrian
Tschermak, the German Correns and the
Dutch scientist De Vries. Paradoxically,
however, it did not at once contribute to im¬
proving Darwin's theory. Quite the con¬
trary, it was the occasion for a_conflict over
the nature of the variations through which
natural selection operates. The advocates of
Mendelism considered those variations to be
sudden and sweeping. Hugo de Vries, for
one, thought that evolution was the result of
spasmodic "mutations", of "leaps" that
32
suddenly produced new forms (muta-
tionism). But Darwin had for his part stated
that evolution was a continuous and
cumulative process involving tiny varia¬
tions. This led to a crisis in biological think¬
ing in the early twentieth century, which was
only really solved in the 1920s to 1930s,
when R.A. Fisher, S. Wright and J.B.S.
Haldane developed population genetics.
This discipline, which studies the way in
which genes are spread among populations,
made it possible to present Darwinism in a
more satisfactory form. Around the year
1940, a new overall conception which is
commonly called the "synthetic theory" of
evolution came into being, based essentially
on the work of Theodosius Dobzhansky,
Ernst Mayr and George Gaylord Simpson.
Under this theory, Darwin's beloved varia¬
tions were defined as mutations, meaning
chance accidents affecting certain genes.
The new synthesis not only took account of
progress in genetics, but incorporated
various findings relating to the concept of
species, biogeography, palaeontology, etc.
It was accepted by a large number of scien¬
tists and is still today, in its broad outlines,
the orthodox interpretation.
Recent developments in molecular
biology and biochemistry have made it
possible to analyse evolutionary phenomena
with greater accuracy and detail. We can
now follow under the microscope, so to
speak, the evolution of certain molecules
such as haemoglobin. By and large, the find¬
ings made in the various life sciences have
borne out the theoretical constructs discuss¬
ed above. It should not, however, be im¬
agined that all the problems have been
solved and that neo-Darwinian or neo-
neo-Darwinian theory has reached its final
and definitive form.
Even such apparently simple concepts as
adaptation and natural selection are subject
to various degrees of criticism. Some
biologists, for example, point out that it is
extremely difficult to ascertain exactly
whether a given gene has really been selected
for its biological "utility". In this regard,
mention should be made of the "neutralist"
theory of the Japanese M. Kimura, accor¬
ding to which many genes are neither useful
nor harmful from the evolutionary view¬
point, but merely neutral. Additionally, the
Americans Gould and Eldredge have recent¬
ly suggested a theory (known as punctuated
equilibria), which runs counter to the
generally accepted ideas. In their view,
evolution is not a regular and continuous
process, but one of relatively sharp evolu¬
tionary "leaps". These and other points
give rise to much debate, and neo-
Darwinian theory may well in future years
undergo major revision.
There has been much talk in recent times
of a new discipline that is also part of the
Darwinian tradition: sociobiology. Its pur¬
pose is to use biology to explain the social
behaviour of animals in general and of man
in particular. A preponderant role in the
birth of this science has been played by the
American Edward O. Wilson (Socio¬
biology: The New Synthesis, 1975). He has
formulated a vast theory which takes up the
essential lines of Darwinism but also draws
on genetics, ecology, ethology and other
disciplines. In his view, all social behaviour
has an underlying genetic foundation and
must be explained in that light: from the
biological viewpoint, it would appear that
individual organisms are designed only to
secure. the maximal reproduction of genes.
In other works, genes are "selfish": they use
animals (termites, geese, goats, chimpanzees
or men) to reproduce themselves, and social
behaviour such as sexuality, aggression or
religion should be seen as strategies to max¬
imize "genetic profit".
But Wilson has done more than formulate
theories. Building on the principle that
sociobiologists are best qualified in human
behaviour, he has claimed that they should
become the "new moralists" and guide the
planning of society. This far-reaching ambi¬
tion raises very many questions.
First we need to know whether this new
form of Darwinism rests on sound founda¬
tions. Here certain reservations may be
made. It is, for instance, by no means cer¬
tain that there are genes for altruism, con-
formism or homosexuality. Nor is it beyond
dispute that the development of human
societies, which is sometimes very rapid, can
be explained in terms of biological evolution
which is, in comparison, extremely slow.
Another question immediately arises: is it
the job of scientists in this instance,
biologiststo dictate ethical and political
standards to mankind? The Wilson case has
the merit of reminding us that this major
problem is not new. Darwin himself applied
his theory of evolution to the human race,
and was led to speak of "inferior races" and
to claim that woman too was inferior to
man less intelligent, less resourceful, less
courageous. With such testimony to hand,
more or less "scientific" arguments for
racism and sexism could easily be
fabricated! Similarly, the idea of selection
could easily lead on to formidable eugenic
projects to produce populations of
"supermen".
Such was not, of course, Darwin's wish.
But history demonstrates that dangerous
ideologies have often sprung up around
more or less suspect "Darwinian" ideas.
Perhaps a lesson should be drawn from this:
the development of evolutionary theories is
not only a "magnificent adventure in
science", but a cultural undertaking of im¬
mediate relevance to mankind. So let us ad¬
mire all those who, from Anaximander to
our times, have shed a little light on the
origins of life and of our species. But let us
hot forget that theories are only human con¬
structs. They may help us to see things more
clearly, but our future depends on moral
and social choices that transcend science,
even Darwinian science.

COMPUTER CONFIRMS
DARWIN WAS RIGHT
WHY did Darwin entitle his most
important work The Origin of
Species? Evolution is indeed a
process which involves the emergence of
new species; but it also encompasses
phenomena ranging in scale from, for exam-
pie, the extinction of the dinosaurs and the
development of mammals to the appearance
of insecticide-resistant strains of housefly.
Darwin obviously considered the forma¬
tion of species, by which he meant the
origination of new species through a process
of development from earlier forms, to be the

key to evolution, and that only by unravell¬
ing the secrets of that process would it be
possible to understand all the other
phenomena involved. But he failed to make
a distinction between the development of
varieties and the development of an increas¬
ingly complex hierarchy of genera, families,
orders, classes and divisions or phyla. We
should remember, however, that in
Darwin's time genetics as a science did not
exist and that he knew nothing of the work
of his contemporary Mendel.
There can be no doubt that Darwin's

thinking led him to the frontier which
separates the formation of species from the
development of more complex groups and
establishes a distinction, for example, bet¬
ween the origination of the domestic dog,
and that of the entire Canidae family. Not
without reason did he devote a whole
chapter of The Origin of Species to the sub¬
ject of hybridization within and between
species. Expressed in modern scientific
language, what had caught his attention was
the cessation of genetic interchange that oc¬
curs when a species is formed.
Today, it is possible to distinguish bet¬
ween micro-evolutionary and macro-
evolutionary processes. Micro-evolution
comprises the sum total of the developments
which occur within species, over relatively
limited geographical areas and during
relatively short periods of time (measured in
a few hundred or a few thousand genera¬
tions), and which culminate in the forma¬
tion of a new species or the separation of the
original species into two sub-species.
The mechanisms of species formation are
now fairly well understood. In plant and
animal populations alike, successive genera¬
tions are subjected over long periods of time
to environmental pressures which ultimately
result in the selection of inherited variations
best suited to coping with those pressures.
But where is the material for this process of
selection to be found? Firstly, in the pro¬
ducts of mutation, i.e. the accumulated
hereditary changes which are primarily caus¬
ed by modifications in the genetic structure
of the cells of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid).
The second source of variations which
enable selection to occur is to be found in
the process whereby bisexual organisms
reproduce themselves. Since sexual
reproduction permits the combination of
genes inherited from both male and female
parents, the number of possible combina¬
tions increases with each new generation.
The combinations which prove most suc¬
cessful are those which are most likely to
reproduce themselves. Little by little, the
characteristics by which the individuals
which form a population may be
distinguished are changed, until a new
species is formed.
Under normal circumstances, the genetic
changes which occur in this manner,

gradually separating one population from
others of the same parent species until it
becomes a species in its own right, preclude
interbreeding. Darwin quotes the example
of a rabbit population introduced from
Europe to the island of Madeira: after three
hundred years, the Madeiran rabbits had
changed in outward appearance, shrunk to
the size of rats and could no longer breed
with those of Europe.
The processes of micro- and macro-
evolution meet at the point where species are
formed. Here again, it was not without
reason that Darwin's interest was roused by
the infertility of hybrids from crossed
species. It is important to remember,
however, that when a population detaches
itself from the parent species and becomes a
new species, the micro-evolutionary process
continues in each, in the same manner as
before but along two distinct paths. Where
the new species and its parent stock were
formerly partners in the evolutionary pro¬
cess, each now becomes an environmental
factor as far as the other is concerned, and
the relationship of the newcomers to their
forebears may be a competitive one. In so
far as the differences between similar species
may be very slight it is not always easy to
draw a line between micro- and macro-
evolution. Quite often the formerly clear
limits which defined a species can be
broken, for example, when human activity
disrupts the ecosystem. An area straddling
the border between the southern part of the
United States and Mexico was formerly
shared, but with clear territorial demarca¬
tions, by two species of towhee songbirds.
One species frequented deciduous and the
other coniferous woodlands; today, as a
result of deforestation, an increasingly
hybrid population may be observed.
Although it would not be difficult to give
many similar examples, it is still correct, on
the whole, to state that micro-evolution
ends and macro-evolution begins at the line
of demarcation of a given species.
Macro-evolution comprises the ap¬
pearance and development on an enor¬
mous scale at times encompassing the entire
biosphere and over millions if not hundreds
of millions of years of the more complex
organizational structures in which in¬
dividual species are absorbed: genera,
families, orders, classes, divisions (for
plants), phyla (for animals) and kingdoms.
Because their dimensions are so great, it is
impossible to investigate macro-evolu¬
tionary processes with one of the most
powerful tools of scientific enquiry-
experimentation.
It was Hegel, I believe, who described the
historian as a prophet who foretold the past.
The same may be said of macro-
evolutionists. At the end of the nineteenth
century, Darwin's successors were for the
most part concerned with macro-
evolutionary issues. It was only after the
rediscovery of Mendel's laws in 1900 and the
stormy period of controversy during which
the science of genetics was born that the in¬
vestigation of micro-evolutionary processes
assumed its rightful place in the develop¬
ment of a more comprehensive theory of
evolution.
Today, the majority of scientists are in¬
clined to believe that there are no fun¬
damental distinctions between micro- and
34
macro-evolution and that they are merely
different phases of a single evolutionary
process. All the evolutionary phenomena
observed can be fully explained by modern
genetics. But this is not, however, the
unanimous view, and more than a few scien¬
tists consider that the evolution of supra-
specific groups follows entirely different
laws.
Richard Goldschmidt, who has been
responsible for some distinguished research
in the micro-evolutionary field, believes that
families, orders and classes are the product
of macro-mutations, that is, of extremely
radical changes in individual members of a
population. These individuals, that
Goldschmidt calls "highly promising
freaks", become the founders of new
categories. According to this thesis, macro-
evolution occurs by leaps and bounds; the
first bird suddenly flies up from the class of
reptiles, the first man walks away from the
class of man-like apes, and so on.
But this theory of macro-mutation begs
too many questions. It is hardly con¬
ceivable, for example, that the "highly pro¬
mising freak", thrown up as a "one-off"
example in a given population, would be
able to find a partner for the reproduction
of offspring.
Moreover, palaeontological evidence con¬
tradicts this extravagant hypothesis. The
founders of new groups differ only slightly
from the other members of the populations
from which they emerge. The primitive bird,
Archaeopteryx, was, after all, only a
feather-covered reptile, and our ancestor
Australopithecus, apart from his upright
posture, was virtually indistinguishable
from the apes.
All the examples of macro-mutation (of
the type which led to the development of a
second pair of wings in the Drosophila fruit
fly) in fact involve the reappearance of
earlier, rather than the emergence of new,
characteristics. They reflect the
phenomenon of atavism, as does, for exam¬
ple, the existence of a vestigial tail in some
humans. No genus, order or class can exist
and evolve otherwise than as an aggregate of
all the species it encompasses; indeed, it is
not orders, classes or other more complex
categories which evolve, but the species of
which they are composed.
Other explanations of macro-evolution
have been advanced, all of them leading in
the last resort either to the premise that it is
The first hominid,

a process which occurs in fits and starts or to
the postulation of new laws governing the
appearance of more complex categories. In¬
deed, attempts to drive a wedge between
micro- and macro-evolution are renewed
with such regularity that one may be inclin¬
ed to ask whether there is not an objective
reason for this. May there not be something
in the very nature of our knowledge concer¬
ning the historical development of living
things which leads scientists along paths that
are marked out neither by facts nor by
logic?
Perhaps the main cause lies in our inabili¬
ty, for the time being, to observe the process
of evolution in anything other than ter¬
restrial terms. 'Let us imagine what would
happen if a visitor from outer space were to
pass judgment on human life in its entirety
on the basis of the biography of a single
earth-dweller. Some of his conclusions
would undoubtedly be correct, but he might
also be inclined to transform the chance
events of that individual's life into laws
which he considered applicable to mankind
as a whole.
The same is true where macro-evolution is
concerned. In the final analysis, the disap¬
pearance of certain groups of living
organisms and the progress and prosperity
of others depend in great measure on purely
fortuitous circumstances. Perhaps only
when we have discovered life forms on a
dozen other planets in the universe shall we
be able to distinguish what, in the process of
evolution, follows a certain pattern and
what is wholly accidental. Only then, to use
the language of statisticians, will the sample
be adequately representative.
Earlier I stated that experimentation was
impossible where macro-evolution is con¬
cerned. This is not altogether correct. Ex¬
periments can be conducted if we translate
the evolutionary process into computer
language. Three years ago I was able to take
part in a series of experiments carried out by
V.V. Menshutkina specialist in the
mathematical modelling of biological pro¬
cesses concerning the evolution of
segmented animals of the Arthropoda and
Chordata phyla.
The computer's memory was fed with
adequately detailed descriptions of a
primitive segmented worm and of a
primitive protochordate similar to the
creature which has survived until modern
times in the form of the amphioxus, a
worm-like marine animal. This primitive
species was subject to change; furthermore
these changes were a matter of chance and
were equally likely to be progressive or
regressive. In other works, what Darwin
called "Lamarck's nonsense of 'a tendency
to progression'" was not fed into the
computer.
Account was also taken of another rule of
Darwinian evolution: Natura non fach
saltum; violent changes of the type propos¬
ed in Goldschmidt's theory of macro-
mutation were excluded as possibilities.
At intervals in the operation (correspon¬
ding to approximately one million years on
the palaeontological time-scale), the com¬
puter was instructed to select the best-
adapted variations. "Outsiders" were
removed from the computer's memory and

competitors. Since the computer could
simulate a million years in nine-hundredths
of a minute, there was no difficulty in
reconstructing the process of evolution from
the Cambrian period up to the present.
The results of these experiments were
highly significant. I shall merely describe
here how the evolution of the chordates was
seen by the computer to have occurred.
After the computer had been running for
a period equivalent to 100 million years, the
initial data fed into the machine, which con¬
cerned the primitive protochordate (a small,
worm-like marine organism a few cen¬
timetres in length, with swimming muscles,
a notochord a rod made of gristle that ex¬
tends down the length of the animal and
supports the body and an enclosing
backbone, but without either a brain or
cranium), had generated the characteristics
of a great number of fish-like creatures with
bony skeletons and scales, some of them ag¬
gressive and predatory, others peaceful and
harmless. After 350 million years' worth of
operation, the computer announced a
creature which crawled up out of the water
on to dry land, and then went on to produce
the characteristics of amphibians, reptiles
and, eventually, mammals. And when the
operation had spanned the equivalent of
1,000 million years of evolution, a most
outlandish creature emerged: a vigorous
predatory animal with an extremely well
developed nervous system, travelling on
two legs, its forward extremities swinging
free. It was not difficult to recognize
in this phenomenon a mathematically-
modelled Pithecanthropus, or at least
A ustralopithecus.
All the subsequent experiments, which
were based on identical source-data and
programming, produced various results. Let
me recall in this connexion that the com¬
puter had been instructed to perform in ac¬
cordance with Darwin's concept of random
variation. In one experiment, fish emerged
on to dry land on three pairs of fins. In
another, the computer announced four-
legged creatures with arms, very similar to
the centaurs of mythology. The exercise
showed that in its details, macro-evolution
was an unpredictable process, and the same
is in all probability true where "real life"
evolution is concerned. It is unlikely that in
the future, however far our wanderings in
the Galaxy take us, that we shall find two
planets with identical biospheres.
There is another, no less important con¬
clusion to be drawn from the type of experi¬
ment to which I have referred. The evolu¬
tionary process simulated by the computer
continued satisfactorily under stable en¬
vironmental conditions. In all likelihood,
real evolution does not require disturbances
of catastrophic dimensions, such as the drift
of continents or the onset of ice ages, for
new forms of life to develop or old forms to
become extinct. Our experiments produced
moments when new species were suddenly
formed, and periods when species ceased to
exist, but in each case these phenomena
could be attributed to the influence of other
biotic factors in the biosphere. For example,
one experiment concerned a freshwater en¬
vironment which was for a long time
dominated by creatures which resembled
fish, except that they lacked jaws (similar to
the lampreys and hagfish of the
Cyclostomata group of animals); when this
environment was invaded by jawed fish
from the sea, the earlier population declined
rapidly; within a period of years it had vir¬
tually disappeared.
The most important conclusion of all,
however, is that Darwin's principle of
natural selection among random inherited
variations is perfectly adequate for the
mathematical modelling of progressive
macro-evolution. In my opinion, there are
no grounds for believing that the actual pro
cess of evolution on earth has occurred
otherwise.
In the light of the experiments I have
mentioned, it would appear advisable to
adopt an even more sceptical attitude to
every attempt to discern, in the macro-
evolutionary process, different causes and
mechanisms from those which Darwin an¬
nounced in 1859. Should we not be guided
by Newton's principle of simplicity: "We
are to admit no more causes of natural
things than such as are both true and suffi¬
cient to explain their appearances".

10 cm long, elongated in form,
with segmental muscles, a

cord), and spinal marrow. It has
neither brain nor cranium, no
pairs of fins nor other ex¬

ticles of mud which are absorbed
through its pharynx perforated
with branchial slits. It is fertilized
externally, lays tiny eggs, takes
no care of its young." Each figure
corresponds to a degree of deve¬
lopment of a given characteristic;
in the case of the brain, for exam¬
ple, from total absence to full
development. For each genera¬
tion, the random figures produc¬
ed by the computer only modified
the coefficient of a given
characteristic by one point more
or less; thus viviparity (the pro¬
duction of living young rather
than eggs) and milk feeding for
example, could not appear sud¬
denly, through an evolutionary
leap. The computer then sorted
out the different variants and
conserved the best-adapted. By
the 100th operation (the gap bet¬

appeared (4). By the 1,000th
operation a predatory biped ap¬
peared, endowed with a highly
developed nervous system and
with the free use of its forward
extremities (centre of drawing 5).

AN ASTRONOMER REFLECTS:
WAS DARWIN WRONG?
by Chandra Wickramasinghe
I can hardly remember my first encounter
with Darwin's Theory of Evolution,
but it was surely taught in a classroom
context at a very early age, long before I was
in any position to assess the facts. It was
presented, at least by implication, as a pro¬
ven unshakable fact. I was asked to believe
that lifeless inorganic matter sprang into life
by a process of random shuffling of
molecules at some distant time in the past on
our planet. I was asked further to accept
that the life that developed thereafter on our
planet was entirely the result of neo-
Darwinian evolution. The strong live on to
become stronger, the weak die to be buried
in oblivion. It impressed me as a great
theory, seductive and compelling, even
though it ran counter to my own cultural in¬
heritance of Buddhist beliefs that the
universe is eternal and that the patterns of
life within it have a permanent quality.
Neo-Darwinist ideas became firmly im¬
printed in my mind and they became part
and parcel of my scientific inheritance. I was
trained first as a mathematician and later as
an astronomer with a tacit acceptance of

Hoyle.
current biological dogma. Since I did not
make a systematic study of biology until
about five years ago, I had not until this
time any opportunity of seeing for myself
what the facts really were.
The reason for my coming to challenge
accepted beliefs in Darwinian evolution
stems from my joint work with the British
astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle. In 1962 we
began work on the nature of interstellar dust
and we were led at this time to conclude that
dust grains in space must contain a compo¬
nent in the form of microscopic submicron-
sized graphite spheres. Then followed a long
and painful struggle to find out what else
there was in interstellar dust besides
graphite. In 1972, I found that organic
polymerslong chains of carbon-based
organic moleculeswere involved. Two
years ago we reached the conclusion that a
whole body of astronomical data pointed to
micro-organisms being present on a colossal
scale in space, some 1052 individual cells be¬
ing present in our galaxy. We found that the
way in which starlight of various colours
was dimmed by interstellar dust was in¬
dicative of the presence of living cells in
space, some of which had become selectively
degraded into graphite. We concluded now
with a considerable measure of confidence
that microbiology operated on a cosmic
scale.
In studying the spectral behaviour of
micro-organisms in the laboratory we next
noticed that a diagnostic thumbprint of
biology existed in the infrared wavelength
region. We compared laboratory data with
the observed behaviour of infrared absorp
tion for a star at the centre of our galaxy and
found a remarkably close correspondence
between microbiology and astronomy.
Bacteria seemed, therefore, to be present on
a galaxy-wide scale. These identifications
are, in the view of Sir Fred Hoyle and
myself, as decisive as any that could be ob¬
tained from a comparison between
laboratory data and astronomical observa¬
tions. More recently there has also been the
decisive discovery of fossil micro-organisms
in carbonaceous meteorites, bits of rock
that fall from the skies and which cannot
have any connexion with the earth. The
failure on the part of most scientists today
to recognize such obvious facts is due in
large measure to their early indoctrination in
Darwinism, a theory that tacitly implies a
beginning of life on the earth.
The facts as we have them show clearly
that life on earth is derived from what ap¬
pears to be an all-pêrvasive galaxy-wide liv¬
ing system. Terrestrial life had its origins in
the gas and dust clouds of space, which later
became incorporated in and amplified
within comets. Life was derived from and
continues to be driven by sources outside the
earth, in direct contradiction to the Dar¬
winian theory.
Recent evidence points to life first appear¬
ing on the earth about 3.8 billion years ago.
This life was in the form of micro-orga¬
nisms bacteria and micro-fungi now evi¬
dent in the earth's oldest sediments.
It would seem significant that life appears

a quiescent crust, an atmosphere and
oceans, at the very first moment in fact that
life was able to survive. Throughout sub¬
sequent epochs of geological time life
developed and evolved both in complexity
and sophistication. It is believed by neo-,
Darwinists that the full spectrum of life as
we see it today as well as in the past is ac¬
counted for by the steady accumulation of
copying errors and the consequent develop¬
ment of variety as a primitive living system is
copied billions upon billions of times. It is
stated according to the theory that the ac¬
cumulation of copying errors, sorted out by
the processes of natural selection, the sur¬
vival of the fittest, could account both for
the rich diversity of life and for the steady
upward progression from bacterium to man.
In our recent book Sir Fred Hoyle and I
have argued strongly against this proposi¬
tion. We agree that successive copying
would accumulate errors, but such errors on
the average would lead to a steady degrada¬
tion of information. It is ridiculous to sup¬
pose that the information provided by one
single primitive bacterium can be upgraded
by copying to produce a man, and all other
living things that inhabit our planet. This
conventional wisdom, as it is called, is
similar to the proposition that the first page
of Genesis copied billions upon billions of
times would eventually accumulate enough
copying errors and hence enough variety to
produce not merely the entire Bible but all
the holdings of all the major libraries of the
world. The two statements are equally
ridiculous. The processes of mutations and
natural selection can only produce very

minor effects in life as a kind of fine tuning
of the whole evolutionary process. There is
above all an absolute need for a continual
addition of information for life, an addition
that extends in time throughout the entire
period of the geological record.
Frequent and massive gaps in the fossil
record and the absence of transitional forms
at the most crucial stages in the development
of life show clearly that Darwinism is
woefully inadequate to explain the facts.
What the fossil record does show beyond
doubt is that new properties of life at the
level of expressed genes have been introduc¬
ed by successive, natural experiments. Only
when these experiments were successful did
the changes endure. Lines with unsuccessful
or inoperable gene addition simply died
away.
Gene additions could take place by the in¬
teraction between space-borne viruses and
viroids and the spectrum of life as it exists
on the earth at any give time. When the
structure of viruses was first discovered, it
was argued by some scientists that these par¬
ticles were the Iong-sought-for missing link
in the Darwinian picture between non-living
matter and life. Yet it was soon realised that
the proteins of viruses were far too com¬
plicated for this to be true. In fact the struc¬
tures of various viral proteins bore so close a
relationship to those in higher life that it was
thought at one time that these particles
might in some way be derived from higher
life. In our book Diseases from Space Sir
Fred Hoyle and I argued that our genomes
are chock-a-block with viruses and viroids.
Viral invasions could lead to epidemic
diseases as for example in the case of in¬
fluenza. Patterns of influenza outbreaks
clearly proved a direct space incidence for
the causative pathogens.
In our view every crucial new inheritable
property that appears in the course of the
evolution of species must have an external
cosmic origin. Although ape and man ad¬
mittedly have much in common,
biochemically, anatomically and physio¬
logically, they are at the same time a world
apart. We cannot accept that the genes for
producing great works of art or literature or
music, or for developing skills in higher
mathematics emerged from chance muta¬
tions of monkey genes long ahead of their
having any conceivable relevance for sur¬
vival in a Darwinian sense. Just as for the
case of the most primitive life on our planet,
all these properties had to be implanted
from outside. If the earth were sealed off
from all sources of external genes, bugs
could replicate till doomsday, but they
would still only be bugs; and monkey col¬
onies would also reproduce but only to pro¬
duce more monkeys. The earth would be a
dull place indeed.
Yet perhaps the most significant single
difficulty associated with the neo-Darwinist
view of life is that micro-organisms are far
too complicated. When bacteria were
created, or accomplished, or formed as the
case may be, it is true to say that 99.99 per
cent of the biochemistry of higher life was
already discovered. Some 2,000 or so en¬
zymes are known to be crucial over a fairly
wide spectrum of life ranging from simple
micro-organisms all the way up to Man. The
variation of amino acid sequences in these
enzymes are, on the whole, rather minor. In
each enzyme a number of key positions are
occupied by almost invariant amino acids.
Let us consider how these enzymes se¬
quences could have been derived from a
primordial soup containing equal propor¬
tions of the twenty biologically important
amino acids. At a conservative estimate say

fifteen sites per enzyme must be fixed to be
filled by particular amino acids for proper
biological function. The number of trial
assemblies needed to find this set is easily
calculated to be about 1040'000a truly enor¬
mous, super astronomical number. And the
probability of discovering this set by ran¬
dom shuffling is one in 1040'000. This latter
number could be taken as a measure of the
information content of life as reflected in
the enzymes alone. The number of shuffl¬
ings needed to find life exceeds by many
many powers of 10 the number of all the
atoms in the entire observable universe. A
tornado blowing through an aircraft scrap
heap has a better chance of assembling a
brand new jumbo jet from bits of junk than
life being assembled from its components by
random processes.
Life, in my view could not be an accident,
not just on the earth alone, but anywhere,
anywhere at all in the universe. The facts as
we now see them point to one of two distinct
conclusions: an act of deliberate creation, or
an indelible permanence of the patterns of
life in a universe that is eternal and
boundless. For those who accept modern
cosmological views as gospel truth the latter
alternative might be thought unlikely, and
so one might be driven inescapably to accept
life as being an act of deliberate creation.
Creation would then be brought into the
realm of empirical science.
The notion of a creator placed outside the
universe poses logical difficulties, and is not-
one to which I can easily subscribe. My own
philosophical preference is for an essentially
eternal, boundless universe, wherein a
creator of life, an intelligence considerably
higher than ours, somehow emerged in a
natural way. My colleague Sir Fred Hoyle
has also expressed a similar preference. In
the present state of our knowledge about life
and about the universe, an emphatic denial
of some form of creation as an explanation
for the origin of life implies a blindness to
fact and an arrogance that cannot be con¬
doned. Just as the earth was proved not to
be the physical centre of the universe, it
seems to me equally obvious that the highest
intelligence in the world cannot be centred
on the earth.
M Chandra Wickramasinghe 58

Just published
Le Temps des Peuples, the latest book by Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, is
based on speeches made during his first mandate as Unesco's Director-General,
from November 1974 to November 1980. It presents an outstanding picture of
Unesco's activities in its spheres of competenceeducation, science, culture and
communicationall of them directed to a single overriding purpose: the preser¬
vation of world peace.
This is far from being an anthology of texts related exclusively to the demands of
an office and of the ceremonial occasions that accompany it. In its pages the
guiding principles of Unesco's activities are clearly defined, together with the
spirit which inspired Unesco during these six years. There is a unity of vision
which transcends the specific situation which gave rise to each text.
The contents, neither didactic nor abstract, are meant for the general reader.
The author sets out to convince, to awaken consciences and to rally them to his
cause: the achievement of self-fulfilment by all the peoples of the world.
Mr. M'Bow is determined to remain alert and responsive to the problems of the
modern world, in order to express the needs of peoples and their aspirations to
dignity, justice and peace, to voice their most pressing claims for education,
knowledge, leisure and cultural activities, and to pursue with them their ideals of
comprehension and universal brotherhood.
If the Third World occupies a central position in Le Temps des Peuples it is not
because of a sectarian choice but because the plain facts of the world situation
demand it. Here the preoccupations of the man and the Organization he leads
are as oneto act where peoples are threatened, to propose and implement
viable solutions accepted by all. This work by a great servant of modern
humanism offers the reader a detailed and clear-sighted panorama of the world
today.
Le Temps des Peuples is published, in French, by the Paris publishing house
Robert Laffont.
