There have been spectacular advances 
in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in 
recent years, leading to inventions that we 
had never thought possible. Computers 
and robots now have the capacity to learn 
how to improve their own work, and even 
make decisions – this is done through an 
algorithm, of course, and without individual 
consciousness. All the same, we must not fail 
to ask some questions. Can a machine think?
Towards a global code 
of ethics for artificial intelligence research
© Evgenija Demnievska 
(evgenijademnievska.com)
What is an AI capable of at this stage 
of its evolution? To what degree is it 
autonomous? Where does that leave 
human decision-making?
More than ushering in a Fourth Industrial 
Revolution, AI is provoking a cultural 
revolution. It is undeniably destined to 
transform our future, but we don’t know 
exactly how, yet. This is why it inspires 
both fascination and fear. 
In this issue, the Courier presents its 
investigation to the reader, elaborating 
on several aspects of this cutting-edge 
technology at the frontiers of computer 
science, engineering and philosophy. It 
sets the record straight on a number of 
points along the way. Because, let’s be 
clear – as things stand, the AI cannot think.
And we are very far from being able 
to download all the components of a 
human being into a computer! A robot 
obeys a set of routines that allows it to 
interact with us humans, but outside the 
very precise framework within which it 
is supposed to interact, it cannot forge a 
genuine social relationship.
Even so, some of AI’s applications are 
already questionable – data collection 
that intrudes on privacy, facial 
recognition algorithms that are supposed 
to identify hostile behaviour or are 
imbued with racial prejudice, military 
drones and autonomous lethal weapons, 
etc. The ethical problems that AI raises – 
and will undoubtedly continue to raise 
tomorrow, with greater gravity – are 
numerous. 
While research is moving full speed ahead on 
the technical side of AI, not much headway 
has been made on the ethical front. Though 
many researchers have expressed concern 
about this, and some countries are starting 
to give it serious thought, there is no 
legal framework to guide future 
research on ethics on a global scale.
“It is our responsibility to lead a 
universal and enlightened debate 
in order to enter this new era 
with our eyes wide open, without 
sacrificing our values, and to 
make it possible to establish a 
common global foundation of 
ethical principles,” says Director-
General Audrey Azoulay, of 
UNESCO’s role, in this issue of the 
Courier (see pp. 37-39).
An international regulatory 
instrument is essential for the 
responsible development of AI, a 
task that UNESCO is in the process 
of undertaking. The Courier lends 
this initiative its support, by exploring 
different avenues of thought on 
the subject.

This idea, which refers to ancient myths 
and legends, like that of the golem [from 
Jewish folklore, an image endowed 
with life], have recently been revived by 
contemporary personalities including 
the British physicist Stephen Hawking 
(1942-2018), American entrepreneur Elon 
Musk, American futurist Ray Kurzweil, and 
proponents of what we now call Strong AI 
or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We 
will not discuss this second meaning here, 
because at least for now, it can only be 
ascribed to a fertile imagination, inspired 
more by science fiction than by any 
tangible scientific reality confirmed by 
experiments and empirical observations. 
For McCarthy, Minsky, and the other 
researchers of the Dartmouth Summer 
Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, 
AI was initially intended to simulate 
each of the different faculties of 
intelligence – human, animal, plant, 
social or phylogenetic – using machines. 
Jean-Gabriel Ganascia
Are machines likely to become 
smarter than humans? No, says 
Jean-Gabriel Ganascia: this 
is a myth inspired by science 
fiction. The computer scientist 
walks us through the major 
milestones in artificial 
intelligence (AI), reviews 
the most recent technical 
advances, and discusses the 
ethical questions that require 
increasingly urgent answers. 
A scientific discipline, AI officially 
began in 1956, during a summer 
workshop organized by four American 
researchers – John McCarthy, Marvin 
Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude 
Shannon – at Dartmouth College in 
New Hampshire, United States. Since 
then, the term “artificial intelligence”, 
probably first coined to create a striking 
impact, has become so popular that 
today everyone has heard of it. This 
application of computer science has 
continued to expand over the years, and 
the technologies it has spawned have 
contributed greatly to changing the 
world over the past sixty years.
However, the success of the term AI is 
sometimes based on a misunderstanding, 
when it is used to refer to an artificial 
entity endowed with intelligence and 
which, as a result, would compete with 
human beings. 
Artificial intelligence:
between myth
and reality
More precisely, this scientific discipline 
was based on the conjecture that all 
cognitive functions – especially learning, 
reasoning, computation, perception, 
memorization, and even scientific 
discovery or artistic creativity – can 
be described with such precision that 
it would be possible to programme a 
computer to reproduce them. In the 
more than sixty years that AI has existed, 
there has been nothing to disprove or 
irrefutably prove this conjecture, which 
remains both open and full of potential.
Uneven progress
In the course of its short existence, AI has 
undergone many changes. These can be 
summarized in six stages.
The time of the prophets
First of all, in the euphoria of AI’s origins 
and early successes, the researchers had 
given free range to their imagination, 
indulging in certain reckless 
pronouncements for which they were 
heavily criticized later. 
CB2, an infant robot, was built by 
Minoru Asada, Japan, who wanted to 
understand how robots learn. 
Here, CB2 is being taught to crawl.

Semantic AI 
The work went on nevertheless, but 
the research was given new direction. It 
focused on the psychology of memory 
and the mechanisms of understanding 
– with attempts to simulate these 
on computers – and on the role of 
knowledge in reasoning. This gave 
rise to techniques for the semantic 
representation of knowledge, which 
developed considerably in the mid-
1970s, and also led to the development 
of expert systems, so called because they 
use the knowledge of skilled specialists 
to reproduce their thought processes. 
Expert systems raised enormous hopes 
in the early 1980s with a whole range of 
applications, including medical diagnosis. 
Neo-connectionism and 
machine learning 
Technical improvements led to the 
development of machine learning 
algorithms, which allowed computers 
to accumulate knowledge and to 
automatically reprogramme themselves, 
using their own experiences.
This led to the development of industrial 
applications (fingerprint identification, 
speech recognition, etc.), where 
techniques from AI, computer science, 
artificial life and other disciplines were 
combined to produce hybrid systems.
From AI to human-machine 
interfaces
Starting in the late 1990s, AI was coupled 
with robotics and human-machine 
interfaces to produce intelligent agents 
that suggested the presence of feelings 
and emotions. This gave rise, among other 
things, to the calculation of emotions 
(affective computing), which evaluates 
the reactions of a subject feeling emotions 
and reproduces them on a machine, 
and especially to the development of 
conversational agents (chatbots).
Renaissance of AI
Since 2010, the power of machines has 
made it possible to exploit enormous 
quantities of data (big data) with deep 
learning techniques, based on the use of 
formal neural networks. A range of very 
successful applications in several areas – 
including speech and image recognition, 
natural language comprehension and 
autonomous cars – are leading to an 
AI renaissance. 
For instance, in 1958, American political 
scientist and economist Herbert 
A. Simon – who received the Nobel 
Prize in Economic Sciences in 1978 – 
had declared that, within ten years, 
machines would become world chess 
champions if they were not barred from 
international competitions. 
The dark years
By the mid-1960s, progress seemed to 
be slow in coming. A 10-year-old child 
beat a computer at a chess game in 
1965, and a report commissioned by the 
US Senate in 1966 described the intrinsic 
limitations of machine translation. AI got 
bad press for about a decade.
ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator 
and Computer), the first programmable 
electronic digital computer, built 
in 1946, during the Second World 
War. Measuring 30 cubic metres and 
weighing 30 tons, it was developed 
by the University of Pennsylvania 
in the United States, and used to 
solve problems in nuclear physics 
and meteorology.

Scientists are also using AI techniques 
to determine the function of certain 
biological macromolecules, especially 
proteins and genomes, from the 
sequences of their constituents – amino 
acids for proteins, bases for genomes. 
More generally, all the sciences are 
undergoing a major epistemological 
rupture with in silico experiments – 
named so because they are carried out 
by computers from massive quantities of 
data, using powerful processors whose 
cores are made of silicon. In this way, 
they differ from in vivo experiments, 
performed on living matter, and above 
all, from in vitro experiments, carried out 
in glass test-tubes.
Today, AI applications affect almost all 
fields of activity – particularly in the 
industry, banking, insurance, health and 
defence sectors. Several routine tasks 
are now automated, transforming many 
trades and eventually eliminating some.

What are the ethical 
risks?
With AI, most dimensions of intelligence 
– except perhaps humour – are subject 
to rational analysis and reconstruction, 
using computers. Moreover, machines 
are exceeding our cognitive faculties in 
most fields, raising fears of ethical risks. 
These risks fall into three categories 
– the scarcity of work, because it can 
be carried out by machines instead 
of humans; the consequences for the 
autonomy of the individual, particularly 
in terms of freedom and security; 
and the overtaking of humanity, 
which would be replaced by more 
“intelligent” machines. 
However, if we examine the reality, we 
see that work (done by humans) is not 
disappearing – quite the contrary – but 
it is changing and calling for new skills. 
Similarly, an individual’s autonomy and 
freedom are not inevitably undermined 
by the development of AI – so long 
as we remain vigilant in the face of 
technological intrusions into our 
private lives. 
Finally, contrary to what some people 
claim, machines pose no existential 
threat to humanity. Their autonomy 
is purely technological, in that it 
corresponds only to material chains 
of causality that go from the taking of 
information to decision-making. On the 
other hand, machines have no moral 
autonomy, because even if they do 
confuse and mislead us in the process 
of making decisions, they do not have a 
will of their own and remain subjugated 
to the objectives that we have assigned 
to them. 
French computer scientist 
Jean-Gabriel Ganascia is a professor at 
Sorbonne University, Paris. He is also a 
researcher at LIP6, the computer science 
laboratory at the Sorbonne, a fellow of 
the European Association for Artificial 
Intelligence, a member of the Institut 
Universitaire de France and chairman 
of the ethics committee of the National 
Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), 
Paris. His current research interests 
include machine learning, symbolic data 
fusion, computational ethics, computer 
ethics and digital humanities. 
Applications
Many achievements using AI techniques 
surpass human capabilities – in 1997, 
a computer programme defeated 
the reigning world chess champion, 
and more recently, in 2016, other 
computer programmes have beaten 
the world’s best Go [an ancient Chinese 
board game] players and some top 
poker players. Computers are proving, 
or helping to prove, mathematical 
theorems; knowledge is being 
automatically constructed from huge 
masses of data, in terabytes (1012 bytes), 
or even petabytes (1015 bytes), using 
machine learning techniques.
As a result, machines can recognize 
speech and transcribe it – just like 
typists did in the past. Computers 
can accurately identify faces or 
fingerprints from among tens of 
millions, or understand texts written 
in natural languages. Using machine 
learning techniques, cars drive 
themselves; machines are better 
than dermatologists at diagnosing 
melanomas using photographs of 
skin moles taken with mobile phone 
cameras; robots are fighting wars 
instead of humans (see p. 25-28); and 
factory production lines are becoming 
increasingly automated.

When Doug McIntosh, an amputee taking 
part in a clinical trial, was able to quickly 
and efficiently grab an object for the first 
time in twenty years without the slightest 
effort, the designer of the bionic hand 
he was wearing said that no reward was 
greater than seeing the joy on his face. 
“It showed my innovation was successful 
and my tester was happy with it,” said 
Dr Kianoush Nazarpour, a biomedical 
engineer at the Institute of Neuroscience 
at Newcastle University, in the United 
Kingdom. The bionic hand is one of the 
winners of the Netexplo Innovation 
Awards 2018. 
The new generation of prosthetic limbs 
allows the wearer to grip objects without 
the use of the brain, automatically and 
without thinking. It is just like a real hand, 
whose ability to grasp objects correctly 
we take so much for granted. 
Chen Xiaorong
An intuitive bionic 
hand that can “see” 
objects by itself 
and is capable of 
precise and smooth handling, 
could change the lives of people 
with upper-limb disabilities. 
Designed by biomedical 
engineers at Newcastle 
University, this prosthesis 
illustrates the collaboration 
between human intention 
and the technical efficiency of 
artificial intelligence (AI). 
A bionic hand that sees
The usual process requires the user to see 
the object, physically stimulate the muscles 
in the arm and trigger a movement in 
the prosthetic limb. In the new version, a 
tiny camera (which costs less than $1.50) 
fitted on the bionic hand takes a picture of 
an object in front of it, assesses its shape 
and size, and triggers a series of smooth 
movements to pick up the object – in a 
matter of seconds. 
The device demands nothing more of the 
wearer than a quick glance in the right 
direction. Choosing from four different 
“grasps” – suitable for picking up a cup, 
holding a TV remote controller, gripping 
objects with a thumb and two fingers, or a 
pinched thumb and first finger – the hand 
uses artificial intelligence to continually 
improve its detection and grasping skills. It 
is ten times faster than current bionic limbs. 
“Responsiveness has been one of the main 
barriers to artificial limbs – controlling 
them takes practice, concentration and 
time,” explains Nazarpour. “Prosthetic limbs 
have changed very little in the past 100 
years – the design is much better and the 
materials are lighter in weight and more 
durable, but they still work in the same 
way,” he adds. “The beauty of this system is 
that it’s much more flexible and the hand 
is able to pick up novel objects – which 
is crucial, since in everyday life people 
effortlessly pick up a variety of objects that 
they have never seen before.”
This bionic hand is capable of quickly 
and easily grasping any object, using 
a camera to assess its shape and 
dimension, which then triggers the 
correct movement to pick it up.

Nazarpour, who has focused his research 
on improving prosthetics since 1999, 
grew up in Iran, dreaming of becoming a 
medical doctor. His research is motivated 
by the potential of prosthetics to restore 
function to individuals with sensorimotor 
deficits, by transforming thought into 
action and sensation into perception.
The crucial point is to understand how 
the peripheral nervous system responds 
to electro-mechanical stimulation of the 
limb, which helps to inform the design of 
prostheses. An electro-mechanical design 
and computer programme are available 
online, which can be adapted to or installed 
in various artificial upper-limb products.
“We produce a device and software 
control system, but not the artificial hands,” 
Nazarpour said, adding that the hardware 
costs just $1. Beyond the obvious benefit 
for disabled people, the bionic hand could 
belong to an intelligent robot, and be of 
interest to industry and businesses. 
Recent statistics show that in the UK there 
are around 600 new upper-limb amputees 
every year, fifty per cent of whom are 
15 to 54 years old. The number is much 
higher in the United States, with 500,000 
new upper-limb amputees every year. “We 
plan to cooperate with many prosthetics 
producers and we need to build up 
networks,” Nazarpour, whose team is still 
perfecting the design, said. “I hope this can 
help thousands of people in the world.”

We live in a time when robots clean 
our houses, drive our vehicles, 
disable bombs, provide prosthetic 
limbs, support surgical procedures, 
manufacture products, entertain, teach 
and surprise us. Just as smartphones and 
social media are offering a connectivity 
beyond anything we imagined, 
robots are beginning to offer physical 
capabilities and artificial intelligence 
(AI), cognitive abilities beyond 
our expectations. Together, these 
technologies could be harnessed to 
help solve important challenges, such as 
ageing societies, environmental threats 
and global conflict.
What will a day in our lives look like, 
in this not-so-distant future? Science 
fiction has explored these possibilities 
for centuries. Our lives will likely be 
longer: with synthetic organs to replace 
defective parts of our bodies, nanosized 
medical interventions allowing the 
precise targeting of diseases and 
genetics, and autonomous vehicles 
reducing fatalities in traffic. 
Vanessa Evers
For an artificial agent to assume 
a real social role and establish 
a meaningful relationship with 
a human, it would need to 
have a psychological, cultural, 
social and emotional profile. 
Current machine learning 
methods do not allow for such 
a development. Tomorrow's 
robots will be our humble 
assistants, nothing more.

Our jobs will change dramatically. 
Certain jobs will not exist anymore 
and new jobs will emerge – in the 
development of robot service apps, for 
instance, that could run on available 
robot platforms in our homes. The 
way we are educated will also change 
radically (see p. 34-35) – our senses and 
brains may be artificially enhanced, and 
our ability to reflect on new insights 
gained from the automated analysis 
of vast amounts of data will require 
a different treatment of information 
in schools. 
But how will we relate to each other 
in a civilization that includes robots? 
In what way will we meet each other, 
have relationships and raise our 
children? To what extent will robots and 
humans merge?

Many of us wonder whether AI will 
become so intelligent and capable 
in human communication that the 
boundaries between human and 
artificial beings will blur. If it is possible 
to communicate in a natural way and 
build a meaningful interaction over 
time with an artificial agent, will there 
still be a divide in the relationships we 
have with people and technology? Also, 
once our human bodies and minds are 
enhanced with AI and robotics, what will 
it mean to be “human”?
Smart tricks
From an engineering perspective, these 
advanced capabilities are still very 
far away. A number of hurdles need 
to be overcome. For now, robots and 
computers are completely dependent 
on a power source – they require a 
lot of electricity, and this complicates 
integrating robotic elements with 
human organic tissue. Another hurdle is 
the intricacy of human communication. 
While a one-off natural language 
conversation in a specific context with a 
robot can feel realistic, engaging people 
verbally and non-verbally over many 
conversations and contexts is quite 
another matter. 
For example, when you call an artificial 
lost-and-found agent at an airport, 
a satisfying conversation is possible 
because there are only a limited number 
of goals the caller has. However, in 
creating a more extended relationship, 
for example, with a robotic pet, a much 
more complicated model must be 
developed. The robot needs to have 
internal goals, an extensive memory 
that relates experiences to various 
contexts, and it needs to develop these 
capabilities over time. 
Through smart “tricks”, a robot can seem 
more intelligent and capable than it 
is – by introducing random behaviours 
which make the robotic pet interesting 
for longer, for instance. Humans have the 
tendency to “make sense” of the robot’s 
behaviours in a human way (we do this 
with animals too).
However, in order to sustain a 
meaningful relationship which deepens 
and evolves over time, an extensive 
artificial inner life will need to be created.
How machines learn
A major hurdle in creating this rich 
artificial inner life is the way machines 
learn. Machine learning is example-
based. We feed the computer examples 
of the phenomenon we want it to 
understand – for instance, when people 
feel comfortable. In teaching a machine 
to recognize this, data of people being 
comfortable is provided – this could 
be in the form of images, videos, their 
speech, heartbeat, social media entries, 
etc. When we feed videos to a computer, 
these are labelled with information on 
whether the people in it are comfortable 
or not – this may be done by experts in 
psychology, or in the local culture. 
The computer uses machine learning to 
“reason” from these labelled videos to 
identify important features that correlate 
with feeling comfortable. This could be 
the body pose of a person, the pitch of 
their voice, etc.
Once the machine has identified the 
features predicting “comfort”, the 
resulting algorithm can be trained and 
improved, using different sets of videos. 
Eventually, the algorithm is robust and 
a computer with a camera can recognize 
how people feel with high, if not 
100 per cent, accuracy. 
Now that we understand roughly how 
machines learn, why is that a hurdle 
in creating a compelling inner life for 
an artificial agent to realize a seamless 
integration with humans?

Towards a complex 
synthetic profile
In order to develop an artificial agent 
that can have a sustained relationship, 
over a long period of time, with a person, 
we need the agent to have a compelling 
personality and behaviours, understand 
the person, the situation in which they 
are both in, and the history of their 
communication. More importantly, 
the agent would have to keep the 
communication going across a variety 
of topics and situations. It is possible 
to make a compelling agent, such as 
Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri, that you 
can speak to in natural language and 
have a meaningful interaction with, 
within the specific context of its use – set 
the alarm clock, make a note, turn down 
the heating, etc. 
However, beyond that context of use, 
the communication quickly breaks 
down. The agent will find acceptable 
responses for a large variety of questions 
and comments, but will not be able to 
sustain an hour-long discussion about 
a complex issue. For instance, when 
parents discuss how to respond to their 
child not working hard at school, the 
conversation is very rich – they bring 
to it their understanding of the child, 
and their own personalities, emotions, 
history, socio-economic and cultural 
backgrounds, psychology, genetic 
make-up, behavioural habits and 
understanding of the world.
In order for an artificial agent to take 
on such a meaningful social role and 
develop a real relationship with a 
person, it would need to have a synthetic 
psychological, cultural, social and 
emotional profile. Also, the agent would 
need to learn over time how it “feels” and 
respond to situations in relation to this 
synthetic internal make-up. 
This requires a fundamentally different 
approach to current machine learning. 
An artificially intelligent system 
that develops much like how the 
human brain develops, and that can 
internalize the richness of human 
experiences, is needed. The intricate 
ways people communicate with each 
other and understand the world is 
an unimaginably complex process to 
synthesize. The envisioned and currently 
available models of AI are inspired by the 
human brain or have elements of how 
the brain works, but are not yet plausible 
models of the human brain. 
We already see AI achieving amazing 
feats – like reading the entire internet, 
winning at Go, the ancient Chinese 
board game, or running a fully 
automated factory. However, just like 
the English physicist Stephen Hawking 
(1942-2018) said he had only scratched 
the surface of understanding the 
universe, we are still merely scratching 
the surface of understanding human 
intelligence.
It won’t happen 
tomorrow
Robots and artificially intelligent systems 
will be able to offer us unique abilities 
to support and enhance our decision-
making, understanding of situations 
and ways to act. Robots will be able 
to contribute to or autonomously 
carry out labour. Perhaps robotics 
will be fully physically integrated in 
our human bodies once a number of 
challenges are overcome. Also, we 
will relate to artificial agents as we do 
to humans – by communicating with 
them in natural language, observing 
their behaviours and understanding 
their intentions. However, in order 
to sustain a meaningful relationship 
with conversations and rituals, which 
deepen and evolve over time in the rich 
context of everyday life, as is the case 
between people, an extensive artificial 
inner life will need to be created. As 
long as we replicate or surpass certain 
functions of human intelligence rather 
than the holistic whole of human 
intelligence placed in the rich context 
of our everyday lives, it is unlikely that 
artificial agents and people can be 
totally integrated.

He was named after Giuseppe 
Arcimboldo (1527-1593), the Italian 
Renaissance painter who was famous for 
his portraits of faces made up of flowers, 
fruits, plants and animals. “His paintings 
tell us that, with intelligence, talent, and 
lots of fruit and vegetables, we can solve 
everything,” explains biochemist Pablo 
Zamora, co-founder of NotCo, along with 
Matías Muchnick and Karim Pichara.
Our Giuseppe’s passion is not painting, 
but cooking. To find the right recipe, this 
intelligent chef searches a database of 
plants – to identify which foods need to 
be combined, and in what proportions – 
to produce the desired taste and texture 
of the food being substituted. 
“He finds unusual links between plants 
that he has previously classified at a 
molecular, nutritional, sensorial and 
physiochemical level,” explains Zamora, 
who attended the Netexplo Forum 
2018, held in February at UNESCO 
Headquarters in Paris.
Luckily, Giuseppe is not the only one in 
the kitchen. He is supported by a team 
of scientists and chefs who fine-tune the 
recipes. “He sometimes makes mistakes,” 
Zamora admits. “He can make milk that 
tastes perfect, except it’s pink! So the 
team tells Giuseppe there’s a problem and 
he reformulates the algorithm to get the 
right colour.” 
Chef Giuseppe heralds a new
culinary era 
Karim Pichara, Matías Muchnick 
and Pablo Zamora, 
founders of The Not Company.

Giuseppe could radically 
change our eating habits. But 
this futuristic master chef is 
only an algorithm! He was 
created by The Not Company 
(NotCo), a startup founded 
in Santiago by three young 
Chileans in 2015. With the aid of 
artificial intelligence (AI), they 
produce substitutes of popular 
animal-based foods, using only 
plant-based ingredients to 
reconstitute not just the taste, 
but also the colour, texture and 
nutrients. For his innovation, 
Giuseppe was named one of 
the ten laureates of Netexplo 
Innovation 2018.
Giuseppe never ceases to surprise with 
his combinations of ingredients, which no 
human could think up. “For mayonnaise, 
we use lupines, which, mixed with 
certain chickpea components, makes 
an emulsion very close to that of eggs. 
Mushrooms are used to heighten the 
sensation of sweetness in chocolate and 
canary grass seeds to alter the density of 
certain milks.” 
NotCo is on a mission to revolutionize 
the food industry by crafting and 
marketing healthy and tasty foods 
obtained from plants, at an affordable 
price and produced without harming 
the environment. According to Zamora, 
eighty-five per cent of their clients are 
neither vegan nor vegetarian – they buy 
NotCo’s cutting-edge products because 
they like them and because they are 
healthy and good for the environment. 
It is indeed the beginning of a new era of 
food: the idea is to “change the way we 
make the foods that we love eating, not 
change the foods we eat.” 
Vegetable mayonnaise 
The company’s Not Mayo vegetable 
seasoning that resembles mayonnaise – 
but without GMOs, lactose, gluten, eggs 
or soya – is already on the Chilean market. 
Other products – yogurt, milk, cheese, 
chocolate and cereals – will be launched 
soon. NotCo also plans to expand to 
Argentina, Brazil and Colombia in the 
near future.
The biochemist is convinced that the 
application of artificial intelligence 
to food will contribute to sustainable 
development. The food industry needs 
to transform its production methods, 
he says, reminding us that 1,500 litres 
of water are needed to produce a kilo 
of wheat and ten times that amount to 
produce a kilo of meat, according to the 
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

But can you really have a romantic 
relationship with a robot? No, because 
love and friendship cannot be reduced 
to a set of neuronal transmissions in 
the brain. 
Love and friendship exist beyond 
the individual, and even beyond the 
interaction between two people. When 
I speak, I am participating in something 
that we share in common, language. It is 
the same for love, friendship and thought 
– these are symbolic processes in which 
humans participate. Nobody thinks only 
for themselves. A brain uses its energy to 
participate in thinking. 
To those who believe that a machine can 
think, we must respond that it would 
be astonishing if a machine could think, 
because even the brain does not think! 
From the series Constellations (2014),

Humans, not machines,
create meaning
Miguel Benasayag, 
interviewed by Régis Meyran
In the term “artificial 
intelligence” (AI), the word 
“intelligence” is just a metaphor. 
While an AI may surpass 
humans in terms of calculating 
capacity, it is unable to 
ascribe any meaning to these 
calculations. For the Argentinian 
philosopher and psychoanalyst 
Miguel Benasayag, reducing the 
complexity of a living being to 
computer code is a mistake – 
just as the idea that machines 
can substitute humans is absurd.
Two computers in the Google Brain 
programme could apparently 
communicate with each other in a 
“language” that they themselves created 
and which humans could not decipher. 
What do you think of this?
That just doesn’t make any sense. In 
reality, each time these two machines are 
launched, they systematically repeat the 
same sequence of information exchange. 
And this is not a language, it does not 
communicate. It is a bad metaphor, like 
the one that says the lock “recognizes” 
the key.
It’s rather like when some people say they 
are “friends” with a robot. There are even 
smartphone applications that supposedly 
let you “chat” with one. In Spike Jonze’s 
film, Her (2013), a man is asked a series of 
questions, which enables his brain to be 
mapped. A machine then synthesizes a 
voice and fabricates responses that trigger 
a feeling of being in love, in the man.
What distinguishes human intelligence 
from AI? 
Living intelligence is not a calculating 
machine. It is a process that articulates 
affectivity, corporeality, error. In human 
beings, it presupposes the presence 
of desire and an awareness of their 
own history over the long term. 
Human intelligence is not conceivable 
separately from all other cerebral and 
corporeal processes. 
Unlike humans or animals who think 
with the help of a brain located inside 
their bodies – which itself exists in an 
environment – a machine produces 
calculations and predictions without 
being able to give them any meaning. 
The question of whether a machine can 
substitute humans is, in fact, absurd. It 
is living beings that create meaning, not 
computation. Many AI researchers are 
convinced that the difference between 
living intelligence and artificial intelligence 
is quantitative, whereas it is qualitative.

In your opinion, is reducing a living being 
to code the principal failing of AI?
Indeed, some AI experts are so dazzled 
by their own technical achievements – 
rather like little boys fascinated by their 
construction games – that they lose sight 
of the big picture. They fall into the trap of 
reductionism. 
In 1950, the American mathematician 
and father of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, 
wrote in his book, The Human Use of 
Human Beings, that one day we might be 
able to “telegraph a man”. Four decades 
later, the transhumanist idea of “mind 
uploading” has been built on the same 
fantasy – that the whole real world can 
be reduced to units of information that 
can be transmitted from one piece of 
hardware to another. 
The idea that living beings can be 
modelled into units of information is also 
found in the work of the French biologist 
Pierre-Henri Gouyon, with whom I have 
published a book of interviews, Fabriquer 
le vivant? [Manufacturing the living? 
2012]. Gouyon sees deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) as the platform for a code that 
can be transferred to other platforms. 
But when we think that living beings can 
be modelled into units of information, 
we forget that the sum of information 
units is not the living thing, and no one 
is interested in carrying out research on 
what cannot be modelled. 
Taking into account that which cannot 
be modelled does not lead us to the 
idea of God, or obscurantism, whatever 
some may think. The principles of 
unpredictability and uncertainty can 
be found in all the exact sciences. That 
is why the aspiration of transhumanists 
for total knowledge is part of a perfectly 
irrational, technophile discourse. It owes 
its considerable success to its ability to 
quench the metaphysical thirst of our 
contemporaries. Transhumanists dream of 
a life freed from all uncertainty. Yet in daily 
life, as in research, we have to contend 
with uncertainties and randomness.
According to transhumanist theory, we will 
one day become immortal, thanks to AI. 
In our current postmodern turmoil, where 
we no longer ponder on the relationships 
between things, where reductionism 
and individualism dominate, the 
transhumanist promise takes the place 
of Plato’s cave. 
For the Greek philosopher, real life was 
not to be found in the physical world, but 
in the world of ideas. For transhumanists, 
twenty-four centuries later, real life lies 
not in the body, but in algorithms. For 
them, the body is just a façade – a set 
of useful information must be extracted 
from it, and then we need to get rid of its 
natural defects. That is how they intend to 
achieve immortality.
At scientific conferences, I have had the 
opportunity to meet several members of 
Singularity University [more a think-tank 
than a university, based in Silicon Valley 
in the United States, with an unwritten 
transhumanist approach] who wore 
medallions around their necks requesting 
that, if they died, their heads should 
be cryopreserved. 
I see this as the emergence of a new 
form of conservatism, even though 
I am the one who comes across as a 
bioconservative, because I am opposed to 
the transhumanist philosophy. But when 
my critics call me a reactionary, they are 
using the same types of arguments as 
politicians – who claim to be modernizing 
or reforming, while eroding the social rights 
of a country and labelling as conservative, 
all those who want to defend their rights!
The hybridization of humans and 
machines is already a reality. That is also 
a transhumanist ideal.
We have not even begun to understand 
living beings and hybridization, because 
biological technology today still omits 
almost all of life, which cannot be 
reduced only to those physiochemical 
processes that can be modelled. Having 
said this, the living have already been 
hybridized with the machine, and this will 
certainly be even more so, with products 
resulting from new technologies.

Robot (2013), a performance created for 
dancers and robots by Spanish-French 
choreographer, Blanca Li, who takes a 
questioning look at a world inhabited 
by humans and machines.
There are many machines with which 
we work, and to which we delegate a 
number of functions. But are they all 
necessary? That’s the whole point. I have 
worked on cochlear implants and the 
culture of deaf people. There are millions 
of deaf people who claim their own 
culture – which is not respected enough 
– and who refuse to have a cochlear 
implant because they prefer to express 
themselves in sign language. Does this 
innovation, which could crush the culture
of deaf people, constitute progress? The 
answer is not intrinsically obvious.
Above all, we need to ensure that 
hybridization takes place with respect 
for life. However, what we are witnessing 
today is not so much hybridization 
as the colonization of the living, by 
machines. Because they externalize 
their memories, many people no longer 
remember anything. They have memory 
problems that are not the result of 
degenerative pathologies.
Take the case of Global Positioning Systems 
(GPS), for example. There have been 
studies on taxi drivers in Paris and London, 
both labyrinthine cities. While London taxi 
drivers navigate by orienting themselves, 
Parisians systematically use their GPSes. 
After a three-year period, psychological 
tests showed that the subcortical nuclei 
responsible for mapping time and space 
had atrophied in the Parisian sample 
(atrophies that would certainly be 
reversible if the person abandoned this 
practice). They were affected by a form 
of dyslexia that prevented them from 
negotiating their way through time and 
space. That is colonization – the area of the 
brain is atrophied because its function had 
been delegated, without being replaced 
by anything.
What worries you the most? 
I am worried about the inordinate success 
of the logic of innovation. The notion 
of progress has misfired. It has been 
replaced by the idea of innovation, which 
is something quite different – it contains 
neither a starting point nor an end point, 
and is neither good nor bad. It must, 
therefore, be questioned critically. Using 
a computer word processor is much more 
powerful than the Olivetti typewriter I 
used in the 1970s – for me this is progress. 
But conversely, every smartphone 
contains dozens of applications and 
few people ask themselves seriously 
how many of them they really need. 
Wisdom consists of keeping a distance 
from the fascination provoked by 
entertainment and the effectiveness of 
new technologies.
Also, in a disoriented society that has lost 
its great narratives, the transhumanist 
discourse is very disturbing – it infantilizes 
humans, and views the promises of 
technology without scepticism. In the 
West, technology has always referred to 
the idea of transcending limits. Already 
in the seventeenth century, the French 
philosopher René Descartes, for whom 
the body was a machine, had imagined 
the possibility of thought without a body. 
It is a human temptation to dream that, 
through science, we will free ourselves 
of our bodies and their limitations – 
something that transhumanists believe 
they will finally achieve. 
But the dream of an all-powerful, post-
organic man who knows no limits has 
all kinds of serious consequences for 
society. It seems to me that it should 
even be viewed as a mirror image of the 
rise of religious fundamentalism, which 
lurks behind the supposed natural values 
of humans. I see them as two irrational 
forms of fundamentalism at war.
A philosopher and psychoanalyst, 
Miguel Benasayag (Argentina) is 
a former member of Che Guevara’s 
resistance against Juan Perón’s regime. 
He succeeded in fleeing Argentina in 
1978, after having been imprisoned and 
tortured there, and now lives in Paris. 
His recent publications include Cerveau

Over the last five years or so, basic AI 
research has been all the rage with 
some information technology giants, 
who are investing considerable sums of 
money in the field. Could you explain 
this phenomenon?
The answer is very simple. Science in 
AI has reached a level of maturity that 
makes it very useful for companies. The 
accumulation of big data and the increased 
computing power available, facilitate the 
development of new AI products, which 
will be even more profitable in the future 
than they are today.
Today, when we search the internet, 
we are constantly solicited by targeted 
advertising – these ads allow companies 
like Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, etc., to 
thrive. Currently, AI products have only a 
small share of the market. But economists 
predict that they will account for up to 
15 per cent of the total production of 
goods within a decade. That is enormous.
Yoshua Bengio, interviewed 
by Jasmina Šopova
Artificial intelligence (AI) is 
still in its infancy. “Its level of 
reasoning is very superficial, 
not even equivalent to that of 
a frog,” says Yoshua Bengio, AI 
pioneer and an expert on deep 
learning. However, it already 
poses serious problems of 
monopolization and inequitable 
distribution, which can only 
be resolved on a global scale. 
International coordination is 
imperative in the development 
of AI, he cautions.
Countering the
monopolization
of research 
AI will then allow these companies to sell 
more, to get rich and to be able to pay the 
researchers they recruit even more than 
they do now. By increasing their customer 
base, they will increase the amount of 
data they have access to – and that data is 
a gold-mine that makes the system even 
more powerful.
All this creates a virtuous cycle, which is 
good for these companies but unhealthy 
for society. Such a concentration of power 
can have a negative impact on both 
democracy and the economy. It favours 
large companies and slows down the 
ability of small new companies to enter 
the market, even if they have better 
products to offer.
Yoshua Bengio: “We must encourage 
greater diversity in the business 
world associated with AI, and avoid a 
monopoly situation.”

We must encourage greater diversity in 
the business world associated with AI and 
avoid a monopoly situation.
But the monopoly is already being 
established. How can this be remedied?
With anti-monopoly laws. History teaches 
us that they can be effective against the 
excessive power of some companies. 
Remember Standard Oil in the United 
States, which bought its competitors to 
monopolize the oil market? Or Hollywood, 
which until the middle of the twentieth 
century, controlled seventy per cent of 
film theatres and imposed its rule on the 
distribution of films? The legal decisions 
against these companies and some 
others, helped to rebalance the markets.
I believe that judicious advertising 
regulations can go a long way towards 
preventing the establishment of 
monopolies in AI research. We are all, in 
a way, prisoners of advertising and we 
often forget that we have the option of 
making a collective decision to regulate it, 
so that it is not harmful to society.
Besides, the services provided by large 
private companies like Google and 
Facebook could very well be made public 
− in the same way that television, which 
provides a similar service, is.
You have decided not to work in the 
private sector, haven’t you?
Yes, I want to remain neutral. My 
project is to develop a science that is 
accessible to everyone, and not only to 
a few shareholders. I want research to 
develop in a way that it targets the most 
useful applications for humanity − and 
not necessarily the most profitable for 
the economy.
That said, I have tried to create a common 
ecosystem that is mutually beneficial to 
research and industry at the University of 
Montreal, where I work. Several private 
laboratories have been set up in Quebec’s 
capital, and they collaborate with us. 
Researchers from industry are employed 
as associate professors at the university 
and help train students. Companies make 
donations to universities and give them 
complete freedom to choose which areas 
of research they will invest in.
What is the proportion of researchers 
working in the academic field today?
If I base my answer on the people I meet 
at major international conferences, I 
would say that it is about half. Five years 
ago, virtually all AI researchers worked in 
the academic field.
Private companies recruit talent from 
around the world. Does this contribute to 
brain drain in less developed countries?
Inevitably. That’s why we must think 
collectively about how the poorest 
countries can benefit from the most 
recent research results − but also about 
how to create research centres within 
their universities. In Africa, for example, 
more and more academic institutions 
are offering courses in AI and summer 
schools (see page 20) are being 
organized, which are proving very useful.
In addition, there are a large number of 
courses, tutorials and codes available 
online for free. I meet many young 
people who have been trained through 
the internet. We must also look for 
the best ways to help these students 
train themselves.
Some countries, 
including Canada, 
are investing 
heavily in 
AI research.
Yes, Canada has 
decided to fund 
not only basic 
research and to help startups, 
but also to invest in collective thinking 
and research in the social sciences and 
humanities, in order to assess the social 
impact of AI.
At the initiative of the University of 
Montreal, a debate was started on 
3 November 2017 to help develop the 
Montreal Declaration for a Responsible 
Development of Artificial Intelligence. 
This approach essentially aims to 
establish ethical guidelines for the 
development of AI at the national level.
In the first phase of this long-term 
participatory process, the general public 
is invited to debate with experts and 
policymakers. Seven values have been 
identified: well-being, autonomy, justice, 
privacy, knowledge, democracy and 
responsibility.
At what stage is this reflection, at the 
international level?
To my knowledge, there is no 
international treaty governing AI 
research. Yet, these are international 
issues and without international 
coordination, we will not be able 
to move forward in the right direction.

First and foremost, the general public 
and policymakers must be made aware 
of the concerns about AI. In some parts 
of the world, researchers have already 
issued warnings about major problems, 
and the media and general public have 
responded. These are the first steps that 
will lead us towards a broader global 
political dialogue on the problems posed 
by this discipline, particularly in the areas 
of ethics, the environment and security.

What projects are you working on 
in FAIR’s Paris laboratory?
The topics that interest me most are the 
fairness, transparency and reliability of 
AI. In 2017, a group of colleagues and 
I were the first to develop algorithms 
(Houdini) that evaluate the robustness of 
intelligent systems, whatever the media: 
sound, video or other.
The robustness of algorithms is 
essential for the security of AI products. 
Imagine what could happen if someone 
malicious wanted to change the 
algorithm that drives your autonomous 
car! Any computer system can be 
attacked from the outside – by hacking 
or malicious modification. So it is 
essential to ensure its ability to resist 
such attacks.
Other work I recently published with a 
colleague involves equipping intelligent 
algorithms with the ability to treat all 
human beings fairly – which means 
that their behaviours are no different 
whether you are a man or a woman, 
black or white, etc.
In other words, I try to ensure that 
algorithms are not only as reliable as 
possible, but as relevant as possible 
to the needs and values of the human 
society they are meant to serve.
Moustapha Cissé, interviewed by Katerina Markelova
He is 32 years old, and was born and raised in Senegal where he 
studied mathematics and physics. He earned master's degrees in 
artificial intelligence (AI) in France and Canada before returning 
to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. Two years ago, he joined Facebook 
AI Research (FAIR). Founded in 2013, it has since established 
laboratories around the world − in New York, Menlo Park (California), 
Paris, Montreal, and most recently, in Seattle and Pittsburgh. This, 
in short, is the story of Moustapha Cissé, who tells us about his 
research, his motivations and his hopes.
Democratizing AI in
Africa
Studies have shown that facial 
recognition systems work better with 
European faces than with African ones, 
for example. It is the same for AI systems 
that identify skin cancers: they give 
better results for white patients than for 
black patients. Similarly, some systems 
were found to work better with men 
than with women. There is, therefore, a 
whole axiological dimension that has 
been neglected during the development 
of these systems. I am working with 
other colleagues to integrate this 
dimension from the very beginning in 
the construction of the AI models we 
are working on. This is a very important 
aspect of AI development, if we want 
it to be able to offer the same benefits 
to everyone.
You have said that the AI research 
community should stop focusing 
exclusively on “white people’s problems”.
I term all those technological advances 
that are in the realm of reality in the West 
“white people’s problems”, and the realm 
of the imagination elsewhere, such as 
autonomous cars, for instance. In Africa, 
but also in many parts of Asia and South 
America, people have other problems to 
deal with on a daily basis, the solutions 
of which depend on technologies that 
are much less sophisticated, and yet 
are non-existent. I believe that as a 
scientific community, we could have 
a much greater impact if we looked 
at the problems of these people to 
find solutions.
In concrete terms, how can people's lives 
be improved through AI?
When you give people the opportunity 
to access the information they need 
to build social connections, get more 
quickly integrated into an environment, 
find work, etc., you improve their lives. 
If you use AI to diagnose their diseases 
earlier and offer therapies, you also 
improve their lives.
AI is already changing many industries 
and I would like it to be made available 
to all those who need it – not just part 
of the world's population – to meet 
the various challenges of this century. 
For my part, I try to make things move 
in that direction, at my level. And I 
remain convinced that the AI research 
community is making giant strides.
How can the most disadvantaged 
be given access to these 
technological advances?
If this technology is to be accessible 
to all, it must be taught everywhere. 
It is through education that it will be 
placed in the hands of those who need 
it most. And I guarantee you that if you 
give them the means, people will find 
solutions to their own problems.
For the last three years, I have started, 
along with a group of friends, to teach 
AI at summer schools organized in 
Africa, by Data Science Africa, a non-
profit professional knowledge-sharing 
group. Every summer, for a week or two, 
we introduce various AI techniques to 
students and teachers who want to 
discover this scientific discipline.
Last year, we launched the Black in 
AI initiative with a group of other 
friends. It brought together more than 
200 black researchers (not counting the 
Americans) at the 30th edition of the 
world’s largest AI science conference, 
Neural Information Processing Systems 
(NIPS 2017).

In previous years, we were not even 
ten, out of a total of more than 
5,000 participants.
So, at our modest level, we are trying 
to democratize AI and access to 
information about the discipline. I am 
aware that this is not enough and 
that greater action is needed, but 
I remain optimistic.
Are these initiatives that you have 
launched on your own, or are they part 
of your work at FAIR?
These are initiatives that I launched 
personally with friends, but I have 
received logistical and financial support 
from Facebook, which sponsored most 
of the participation of about fifty young 
African researchers at the conference I 
just talked about.

Yang Qiang, interviewed by Wang Chao
After the internet and mobile internet triggered the Third Industrial 
Revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, driven by 
big data, are fuelling a Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Brazilian artist Raquel Kogan. 
Computer-generated numbers are

integrated into the work.
The FourthRevolution
Could you define big data thinking? How 
could companies adapt to this way of 
thinking and what changes would they 
need to make?
The first point of big data thinking is to 
consciously collect data. In other words, 
before doing any business, you have to 
think about how to collect data.
Second, data collection and core 
algorithms are closely related. You need 
to know what is missing according to the 
algorithms, and then collect data with 
a specific purpose, including data from 
different sources. 
The third requirement is to form a closed 
loop. The services provided by a software 
system should be able to stimulate the 
source to generate more data that can 
be fed back into the system, forming a 
closed loop. This allows for a continuous 
process of self-improvement and self-
refinement of the system. A special 
design is required for the closed loop, 
which is very different from the previous 
design used for business.
Could you elaborate further on a closed 
loop design for AI and big data?
The first thing to consider are data 
providers – for example, users. All user 
behaviours need to be recorded in the 
form of data. Then service providers 
– such as WeChat Pay, the Chinese 
mobile wallet and Taobao, the Chinese 
e-commerce website – have to be 
taken into account. Intelligent feedback 
is generated based on the data to 
understand the needs of users. Users 
provide feedback data to the service 
providers, and service providers in turn 
provide the service data to the users. 
This forms a closed loop.
How did the convergence between AI and 
big data occur? 
The rise of AI and big data started in the 
early 2000s. When Google and Baidu – 
the emerging search engines at the time 
– used AI-powered recommendation 
systems for advertising, they found 
that the results were much better than 
expected. The more data they collected, 
the better the results would be. But at the 
time, no one realized that this would be 
the case in other fields as well.
A real turning point occurred with the 
emerging of ImageNet, the largest 
image recognition database in the 
world, designed for use in visual 
object recognition software research. 
Established by computer scientists at 
Stanford and Princeton universities in 
the United States, it is considered to 
be the beginning of the deep learning 
revolution. The large amount of image 
data on ImageNet resulted in a ten per 
cent drop in the rate of mis-recognition. 
This showed that the convergence of 
deep learning and big data could help 
master extremely complex calculations. 
How would you define the relationship 
between deep learning and big data?
If an AI system is designed well, the 
product will be more convenient to 
use, more accurate, and therefore, 
more useful. There will be more users, 
and hence more data – which in turn, 
makes the AI system better. A mutually 
strengthening relationship exists 
between AI systems and data.
Big data and AI could be merged into a 
new kind of AI, called data intelligence.

For the closed loop to evolve rapidly, 
it should be short enough. And it is 
better not to have people involved in 
it, because the loop cannot be fully 
automated with human participation. 
Second, the update process in the loop 
should happen frequently – it is best if 
this happens several times a day, because 
it keeps updating the system. Third, the 
process must be continuous, so users are 
prompted to provide constant feedback. 
To sum up the process in three words, it 
should be short, frequent, fast.
In your opinion, how long will it take for 
this closed loop to actually be achieved?
I think the future development of AI will 
be divided into two stages. The first stage 
is that all industries will attempt to use 
the technology. For example, security 
and protection services will use facial 
recognition technology; the banking 
sector will use AI in risk control, and so 
on. These are single technologies and 
solutions serving existing industries.
The second phase will be the emergence 
of entirely new industries, with artificial 
intelligence at the core. For example, a 
bank that uses AI as the core technology 
can be completely driven by AI in terms 
of investment, service and credit. Bank 
clerks would only be required to make 
small adjustments. Building entirely new 
kinds of customer service systems would 
also be possible.
I think the second phase of AI will truly 
reshape human society, giving it its 
future form. Just as at the time when 
the internet was emerging, in the first 
stage, a traditional bookstore made a 
web page and considered itself an online 
bookstore, which was not the case. In 
the second phase, websites like Amazon 
were established, that were completely 
different from the traditional bookstore.
The combination of big data and AI could 
also threaten the information flow and 
social equity. How could the normal flow 
of large-scale data be ensured, without 
the infringement of personal privacy?
Products that are created by using big 
data and AI technologies will provide 
excellent new business models. However, 
the precondition for these business 
models to be implemented on a large 
scale would be to ensure the privacy of 
their users. Here are three concerns:
First, we need a set of legal and social 
rules to protect the ownership of data 
and to make it clear where the data can 
or cannot be used. In my opinion, the 
user data should be divided into different 
divisions. For example, data in the red 
zone cannot be touched, data in the 
yellow zone is accessible only to some 
people, whereas everyone has access to 
data in the green zone. There is currently 
no consensus on the division of data. 
Besides, there is no law that specifies the 
definition of the person in charge and the 
penalties for violating these legal rules.
The second phase of AI 
will truly reshape human society,

The second concern is to protect 
data privacy technically. For example, 
4Paradigm (a Beijing-based AI technology 
and service provider) is currently studying 
the use of “migration learning” to protect 
privacy, which is a relatively new field. 
This could help different companies 
exchange data. For example, A makes a 
model, and the model is moved to scene 
B. Instead of exchanging data directly 
between A and B, it is included in the 
model. This is better for the protection of 
user privacy.
Third, we need to conduct more research 
on user privacy and data pricing. 
For example, when users click on an 
online advertisement through an AI 
recommendation system, should this 
system get some of the profits? If a search 
engine earns revenue, should some of it 
be distributed to users? These issues are 
worth exploring.
In the next few years, everyone will realize 
the importance of the “landing” of AI. We’ll 
need to pay more attention to how to 
“land” AI, and to find out which areas are 
suitable for its application. Today, finance, 
the internet, and automated vehicles are 
suitable areas for the “landing” of AI.
From a global perspective, what impact 
will the combination of big data and 
AI have on developing countries?
I think big data and AI technologies 
would enable some emerging countries 
to catch up, or even surpass, traditional 
developed countries. Because in the 
future, economic competition will not 
be only about financial and economic 
scale, but more importantly, about the 
size of data and the speed of embracing 
the data economy. For example, the 
rapid development of China's internet 
and mobile internet has allowed for the 
collection of a large amount of data. This 
will also accelerate the development of 
China's AI industry, which may change 
the world balance.
On the other hand, if a country already 
has a good infrastructure and high-
quality education, it could benefit from AI 
to achieve more efficient production. Just 
as the use of steam engines allowed some 
countries to develop more rapidly during 
the Industrial Revolution.

Many corporations around the world are 
conducting vital scientific research in the 
field of AI. The results to date have been 
excellent – AI has learned to predict a 
person’s risk of developing diabetes with 
the use of a smartwatch, or to tell the 
difference, based on their appearance, 
between moles and certain types of 
cancerous growths. This powerful tool, 
which surpasses human intelligence by 
one of its most important characteristics, 
speed, is also of interest to the military.
The threat of 
killer robots
Vasily Sychev
Artificial intelligence (AI) has a growing number of applications 
in the security and military areas. It facilitates manoeuvres in the 
field, and can save lives when things go wrong. It also boosts 
the performance of armies by providing robot allies to combat 
forces. According to some experts, Lethal Autonomous Weapons 
Systems (LAWS) are creating a “Third Revolution” in warfare, after 
gunpowder and nuclear weapons. It is time we start worrying about 
the day when armies of robots are capable of conducting hostilities 
with full autonomy, without humans to command them.
Thanks to the development of computer 
technologies, the weapons systems of the 
future will become more autonomous 
than those currently being used. On 
one hand, this empowerment will 
undoubtedly provide valuable assistance 
to combatants. On the other, it will bring 
its share of challenges and risks – it could 
set off arms races between countries, 
an absence of rules and laws in combat 
zones, and irresponsibility in decision-
making. Today, many entrepreneurs, 
policymakers and scientists are seeking to 
prohibit the use of autonomous weapons 
systems, although military authorities 
insist that in combat, the final decision – 
to kill or not to kill – will always be made 
by a human.
We want to believe that. But we must 
remember, nuclear weapons – which 
should never have seen the light of day, 
and which have faced opposition from the 
earliest phase of their conception – has 
nevertheless been well and truly used. 
Public opinion is increasingly 
mobilizing against the development of 
lethal autonomous weapons.

A virtual assistant
As in all other spheres of human activity, 
AI can greatly facilitate and accelerate 
work in the field of security. For example, 
researchers at the University of Granada, 
Spain, are developing software that 
uses neural networks to detect small 
weapons – pistols, machine guns and 
submachine guns – on video images, 
almost instantly, and with great 
precision. Modern security systems 
include a large number of surveillance 
cameras whose operators simply cannot 
view every image. The AI is therefore 
very useful for analysing these images, 
detecting the presence of weapons and 
informing agents in record time.
In another example, the Center for 
Geospatial Intelligence (CGI) at the 
University of Missouri in the United States 
has developed an AI system capable 
of rapidly and accurately locating anti-
aircraft missile devices on satellite and 
aerial images. The system’s research 
capacity is up to eighty-five times faster 
than that of human experts. To form the 
neural network underlying this system, 
photographs representing different types 
of anti-aircraft missiles were used. Once 
the system was trained, it was tested on 
a set of photos. In just forty-two minutes, 
it found ninety per cent of the defensive 
devices. It took human experts sixty 
hours of work to solve the same problem, 
yielding the same result.
There are also more complex applications 
of AI. The US Army Research Laboratory 
(ARL), for example, is developing a 
computer system that analyses the 
human response to a given image. It 
will be useful for military analysts who 
need to view and systemize thousands 
of photos and hours of video recordings. 
The principle of the system: the AI tracks 
the person's eyes and face and compares 
facial expressions with the images 
the person is looking at. If an image 
catches the person's attention (meaning 
the facial expression or the direction 
of his gaze changes), the software 
automatically moves it into a thematic 
folder. During the tests, a soldier was 
shown a set of images divided into five 
main categories: boats, pandas, red 
fruit, butterflies and chandeliers. He 
was asked to count only the images 
of the category he was interested in. 
The images scrolled at the rate of one 
per second. The AI “concluded” that 
the soldier was interested in the boats 
category and copied these images into a 
separate file.
In the field of combat
AI can also help soldiers in combat. In 
Russia, for example, the development 
of the fifth-generation Sukhoi Su-57 jet 
fighter is nearing completion; the plane 
could be commissioned before the end 
of 2018. The software of this stealth 
plane’s flight computer contains elements 
of AI. Thus, in flight, the fighter plane is 
constantly analysing the quality of the air, 
its temperature, its pressure and many 
other parameters. If the pilot attempts 
to perform a manoeuvre and the system 
“estimates” the action will cause a crash, 
the pilot’s command will be ignored. 
If the plane goes into a spin, the same 
system tells the pilot how to steady the 
plane and regain control.
Meanwhile, Japan is developing its own 
fifth-generation fighter. Its research 
prototype, the X-2 Shinshin (“Spirit of 
the Heart” in Japanese), made its first 
flight in April 2016. A vast network 
of sensors, which will analyse the 
condition of each component of the 
aircraft and determine any damage it 
has suffered, will ensure its “survival”. If, 
during combat, an aircraft’s wing or tail 
is damaged, its control system will be 
reconfigured so that its manoeuvrability 
and speed remain virtually unchanged. 
The Japanese fighter's computer will be 
able to predict the exact time at which 
a damaged element will fail entirely, so 
that the pilot can decide to continue the 
fight or return to base.
This makes AI a “godsend” – if such 
a term can be used for weapons and 
combat systems.

The UN versus LAWS
Since May 2014, the United Nations has been engaged in an international debate on 
the development of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), also known as 
“killer robots”. The High Contracting Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional 
Weapons (CCW) have adopted a new mandate: “to discuss further the questions 
related to emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems 
(LAWS), in the context of the objectives and purposes of the Convention.”
Meeting for the first time in November 2017, a Group of Governmental Experts 
(GGE), chaired by Indian Ambassador Amandeep Singh Gill, was tasked with 
reviewing emerging technologies in LAWS. One of the guidelines in the consensus 
report of this meeting is that the responsibility for the development of any conflict 
weapons system rests with the states. “States must be accountable for lethal acts by 
their forces in armed conflict,” said Ambassador Singh Gill at the last GGE meeting 
in Geneva, Switzerland, on 9 April 2018.
Izumi Nakamitsu, UN Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for 
Disarmament Affairs, noted at the event that the new technologies were “giving rise 
very quickly to new methods and means of warfare with potentially undesirable 
or unclear consequences”. She stressed on the responsibility of the group to 
“build consensus on common understandings on possible limits on the degree of 
autonomy in the use of lethal force”.
Killer robots
Its speed of analysis and its ability to 
learn make AI attractive for combat 
systems. The military, although they 
still don’t admit it, are probably already 
tempted to create combat systems 
capable of operating on the battlefield 
in a fully autonomous manner, which 
means being able to identify a target, 
open fire on it, move around and choose 
the optimal trajectories, allowing them 
to get to safety. 
A few years ago, the military authorities 
of China, Germany, Russia, the US, and 
several other countries, announced that 
the creation of fully autonomous combat 
systems was not their objective. At the 
same time, the military forces noted that 
such systems are likely to be created.
In 2017, the US Department of Defense 
completed and began to implement the 
Third Offset Strategy. It involves, among 
other things, the active development 
of next-generation technologies and 
concepts, and their use in future military 
initiatives.
On 1 September 2017, Russian President 
Vladimir Putin declared, at a public 
lecture at a school in Yaroslavl: “Artificial 
intelligence is the future, not only for 
        Russia, but for all humankind.

It comes with colossal opportunities, but 
also threats that are difficult to predict 
today. Whoever becomes the leader 
in this sphere, will become the ruler of 
the world.” He added that it would be 
“highly undesirable for anyone to gain a 
monopoly. So, if we become leaders in 
this field, we will share these technologies 
with the entire world.” But does this mean 
that we are not at the beginning of a new 
era of arms races? 
On Earth, a growing number of areas 
are reliably protected by anti-aircraft 
and anti-missile systems, monitored 
by satellite and unmanned systems, 
and patrolled by ships and aircraft. In 
the minds of the military, only combat 
systems with AI will be able to, in the 
event of war, penetrate these closed areas 
and operate with relative freedom.
Today, there are already combat systems 
capable of detecting and classifying 
their targets, and of controlling the 
firing of anti-aircraft missiles, such as the 
S-400 advanced surface-to-air defense 
missile systems in Russia. America’s Aegis 
Combat System, which controls the 
arming of warships, works in the same 
way. Along the demilitarized zone, on 
the border with the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea 
has posted several SGR-A1 military robots 
in charge of surveillance. In automatic 
mode, they are able to open fire on 
the enemy, although they will not fire 
on people who have their hands up. 
However, none of these systems is used 
by the military in automatic mode.
A complex programme capable of 
optimally solving a particular problem 
– ten times faster than a human can 
– not only facilitates the work of a 
reconnaissance aircraft, a drone operator 
or an air defence system commander, 
but it can also save lives. It would be able 
to come to the rescue of crew members 
aboard a submarine in distress (remotely 
putting out fires in compartments 
abandoned by humans), airplane pilots, or 
operators of damaged armoured vehicles.

crawler platform, will be capable 
of autonomously detecting targets 
and bombarding them until they are 
completely destroyed. Russia is also 
simultaneously working on a family 
of tracked robots that will be able 
to participate in combat with 
human soldiers.
For armies, all these systems are called 
upon to perform several basic functions 
– most importantly, to destroy enemy 
targets more efficiently and to save the 
lives of their own soldiers. At the same 
time, there are still no international 
standards or legal documents to 
regulate the use of combat systems 
equipped with AI in war. Neither the 
Laws and Customs of War on Land nor 
the Geneva Conventions define which 
AI systems can be used in combat and 
which cannot. 
Nor is there any international 
legislation that would help identify 
those responsible for the failure of 
an autonomous system. If a drone 
bombards civilians autonomously, who 
will be punished? Its manufacturer? The 
commander of the squadron to which it 
was assigned? The Ministry of Defence? 
The chain of potential culprits is too long 
and, as we know, when there are too 
many culprits, nobody is guilty.
In 2015, the US-based Future of Life 
Institute published an open letter signed 
by more than 16,000 people, warning 
of the threats that AI-based combat 
systems pose to civilians, the risk of an 
arms race, and ultimately, the danger 
of a fatal outcome for humanity. It 
was signed, notably, by the American 
entrepreneur and founder of SpaceX and 
Tesla, Elon Musk, the British astrophysicist 
Stephen Hawking (1942-2018), and the 
American philosopher Noam Chomsky. In 
August 2017, Musk led a group of 116 AI 
experts to send a petition to the United 
Nations, calling for a total ban on the 
development and testing of autonomous 
offensive weapons.
These experts believe that the creation 
of robot armies capable of conducting 
hostilities autonomously will inevitably 
lead to the emergence of feelings of 
absolute power and impunity among 
them. Moreover, when humans are in a 
conflict situation, they make decisions 
that include, inter alia, their moral 
attitudes, feelings and emotions. The 
direct observation of the suffering of 
others still has a deterrent effect on 
military personnel, even if compassion 
and sensitivity eventually diminish 
among professional soldiers. In the event 
of the widespread introduction of LAWS, 
the effects of which can be unleashed 
simply by swiping the screen of a tablet 
on another continent, war will inevitably 
become nothing more than a game, with 
civilian and military casualties reduced 
to numbers on a screen.
An arms expert and journalist, Vasily 
Sychev (Russian Federation) writes for 
publications including the Rossiyskaya 
Gazeta newspaper, Expert, the Russian 
weekly business magazine, Lenta.ru, an 
independent Russian news site, and 
the Military-Industrial Courier, a defence 
newspaper. He also heads the “Arms” and 
“Aviation” sections in the popular science 
web journal N + 1.
Armies of robots capable of waging war 
autonomously remain in the realm of 
science fiction. Still, many AI experts are 
extremely concerned about the possibility.

The end of privacy in the digital age?

Working for,
not against, humanity
Tee Wee Ang and Dafna Feinholz 
(UNESCO)
As we head inexorably towards 
an automated future and the 
almost infinite possibilities of 
artificial intelligence (AI), it is 
imperative that we identify 
the ethical implications of this 
emerging technology and 
address the unprecedented 
legal and social challenges 
that arise.
Never-ending 
data collection
Machine learning and deep learning 
approaches require a large amount 
of historical and real-time data for 
an AI-enabled system to “learn” from 
“experience”, and an infrastructure for 
an AI to implement its goals or tasks, 
based on what it has learnt. This means 
that when we consider the ethical 
implications of AI, we must also take 
into account the complex technological 
environment that is required for AI to 
function. This environment includes the 
constant collection of big data through 
the Internet of Things; the storage of 
big data in the cloud; the use of big 
data by AI for its “learning” process; and 
the implementation of AI’s analyses or 
tasks through smart cities, autonomous 
vehicles, or robotic devices, etc.
When we think about the ethical 
implications of AI, we should be realistic 
about what AI is and is not, today. 
Generally, when we talk about AI we are 
referring to “narrow AI” or “weak AI”, which 
is designed to accomplish a specific task 
− such as analysing and improving traffic 
flow; making online recommendations of 
products, based on previous purchases, 
etc. Such “narrow AI” is already here − and 
will become increasingly complex and 
integrated into our daily lives. 
For now, we are not considering what is 
termed “strong AI” or Artificial General 
Intelligence (AGI) depicted in many 
science-fiction stories and movies − 
which would purportedly be able to 
accomplish the full range of human 
cognitive tasks, and some experts 
argue, would even include traits of 
“self-awareness” and “consciousness”. 
Currently, there is no consensus on 
whether AGI is feasible, let alone when it 
will be achieved.
Every once in a while, we encounter 
a technology that gives us pause to 
consider what it means to be human. 
The advent of AI requires us to engage 
in deep reflection on its potentially far-
reaching impacts. Although the concept 
behind this technology has been in our 
collective imagination for decades, it is 
only now becoming an entrenched reality 
in our lives. 
Recent advances in AI technology − 
especially those related to machine 
learning in general and deep learning in 
particular − have shown that AI-enabled 
systems can outperform humans in 
terms of efficiency and effectiveness in 
many areas, including tasks that require 
some degree of cognitive reasoning. 
As such, AI has the potential to bring 
about tremendous progress and benefits 
for humanity, while at the same time 
creating disruptions in the current socio-
economic and political arrangements of 
human society.

The more complex technological 
development becomes, the more 
complex the ethical questions raised 
will be. While the ethical principles 
do not change, the ways in which we 
address them can change radically. 
As a result, these principles could be 
severely compromised, knowingly 
or unknowingly. 
Our notions of privacy, confidentiality 
and autonomy, for example, could 
change radically. Through smart devices 
and apps that have become instruments 
of social networks like Facebook and 
Twitter, we are “freely” and willingly 
giving out our personal information, 
without properly understanding 
the potential uses of this data and 
by whom. This data is then fed into 
AI-enabled systems that are primarily 
being developed by the private sector. 
This data is not anonymized, so that the 
information about our preferences and 
habits can be used to create patterns 
for behaviour that allow an AI-enabled 
system to deliver political messages, sell 
commercial apps, keep track of some of 
our health-related activities, etc. 
The best and the worst 
Would this mean the end of privacy? 
What about data security and 
vulnerability to hacking by criminals? 
Could this data also be co-opted by the 
State to control its population, perhaps 
to the detriment of the individual’s 
human rights? Would an AI-enabled 
environment that constantly monitors 
our preferences and provides us with 
a range of options based on those 
preferences, limit the extent of our 
autonomy of choice and creativity in 
some way?
Another important question to consider 
is whether the data that is being used by 
an AI-enabled system to learn contains 
embedded biases or prejudices, which 
might lead the AI to make decisions that 
result in discrimination or stigmatization. 
AI systems tasked with social 
interactions or the delivery of social 
services would be particularly vulnerable 
to this. We must be cognisant of the fact 
that some data, such as that generated 
on the internet, contains information 
that reflects both the best and the worst 
of humanity. Therefore, relying on an AI-
enabled system to learn from this data 
is itself insufficient to ensure an ethical 
outcome – direct human intervention 
would be necessary.
Could an AI-enabled system be taught to 
be ethical? Some philosophers argue that 
some experiences – such as aesthetics 
and ethics – are inherent to human 
beings, so they cannot be programmed. 
Others propose that morality can 
be enhanced through rationality, 
and therefore can be programmed, 
but free choice must be respected.

There is currently no consensus about 
whether ethics and morality can be 
taught even to humans, based only on 
rational thinking, let alone to an AI. Even 
if an AI was eventually programmed to 
be ethical, whose ethics would we use? 
Would they only be the ethics of the 
developers? Given that the development 
of AI is primarily driven by the private 
sector, it is imperative to consider the 
possibility that the ethics of the private 
sector could be inconsistent with the 
ethics of society.
If we are to ensure that AI works for, 
instead of against us, we must engage in 
a comprehensive dialogue that includes 
the different ethical perspectives of 
everybody affected by it. We must make 
sure that the ethical framework we use 
to develop AI also takes into account the 
larger questions of social responsibility, 
to counterbalance the potential 
disruptions to human society.
Programme Specialist, Bioethics 
and Ethics of Science at UNESCO, 
Tee Wee Ang (Malaysia) worked in 
design engineering and engineering 
management before joining UNESCO 
in 2005.
Chief of Section, Bioethics and Ethics 
of Science at UNESCO, Dafna Feinholz 
(Mexico) is a psychologist and 
bioethicist by training. She was formerly 
Secretary General of Mexico’s National 
Commission of Bioethics. 
The ethical risks of AI
Marc-Antoine Dilhac, interviewed by Régis Meyran
Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to increase the 
effectiveness of existing discriminatory measures, such as racial 
profiling, behavioural prediction, and even the identification of 
someone’s sexual orientation. The ethical questions raised by 
AI call for legislation to ensure that it is developed responsibly.
What are the issues raised by behaviour analysis software based on 
filmed images?
AI helps to improve the preventive use of video surveillance systems in public 
places. Images are now being continuously analysed by software that detects acts 
of aggression and can quickly raise the alarm. This new system is being tested, for 
example, in the corridors of the Châtelet station in the Paris metro system. If we 
accept the principle of video surveillance, the only problem with the use of AI is 
the risk of error. And this risk is not very high, since it is humans who must take 
the final decision whether or not to intervene. 
Nevertheless, facial recognition errors are very common. All it takes is one 
small glitch in the image for the AI to see a toaster instead of a face! The 
feeling of excessive surveillance and the multiplication of errors can be 
particularly worrying. 
There is also cause for concern that these intelligent systems and the racial and 
social profiling techniques they might use, could lead to abuses.
What kinds of abuse are you referring to?
I’m thinking in particular of the programmes, already being used in several 
countries, to identify “terrorist behaviour” or “criminal character”, using facial 
recognition. Their facial features would therefore be used to indicate their intrinsic 
criminal tendencies! 
Alarmed by this resurgence of physiognomy, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang of 
Stanford University in the United States, wanted to expose the dangers of this 
pseudo-scientific theory – thought to have been relegated to history – which 
claims to study a person’s character, using facial recognition. To draw attention to 
the risks of invasion of privacy, they created an “AI gaydar” in 2017 – a programme 
to identify whether someone is homosexual or not, only by analysing their 
photograph! According to the authors, the margin of error for the programme 
is only twenty per cent. In addition to its stigmatizing effect, the application of 
this technology would violate the right of everyone not to disclose their sexual 
orientation. 
Any scientific research that is carried out without philosophical guidelines or a 
sociological or legal compass is likely to raise ethical problems. The few examples 
I have mentioned show the urgent need to establish an ethical framework for 
AI research.
What about eugenistic abuses?
In my opinion, AI is not a priori a factor of eugenics. Some people prophecy a 
world in which humans can be improved through the use of AI – chips to expand 
memory or improve facial recognition, etc. While intelligent robotics might be 
able to offer medical solutions for some forms of disability (such as providing 
mobility through sophisticated prosthetics), the transhumanist hypothesis of 
the augmented man remains in the realm of science fiction. 
Assistant professor in ethics and political philosophy at the University of Montreal, 
Marc-Antoine Dilhac (France) holds the Canada Research Chair in Public Ethics and 
is co-director of ethical and political research at the Centre for Research on Ethics (CRE).
Could data also 
be co-opted by 
the State to control 
its population, 
perhaps to 
the detriment 
of the individual’s 
human rights?

Karl Schroeder, interviewed by Marie Christine Pinault Desmoulins (UNESCO)
Karl Schroeder devotes his time to reading, studying, observing 
and imagining futuristic stories. Internationally renowned as one of 
the stars of science fiction, his books have inspired experts in new 
technologies and artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, he puts his 
imagination to work for companies and governments, to help them 
anticipate their technological, economic and social transformation. 
For the Canadian novelist and essayist, AI is more a cultural than a 
technological revolution – one that requires reflection on ethical, 
governance and legislation issues.
AI and literature: is it really 
all for the best?
Besides your passion for digital and 
technological innovations, what are your 
sources of inspiration?
I devote a substantial part of my time to 
reading great philosophers. This allows 
me to have an overview, to consider 
the possible connections between 
technologies and societal movements. 
But, let me reassure you, I give just as 
much attention to the plot, so that my 
books are entertaining!
At the same time, the internet is an 
infinite source of information and 
distraction. Any navigation on the 
network is an opportunity for new 
discoveries that may encourage me to 
rethink, or even to change radically, 
everything I have just written. The 
internet really makes my research easier 
and I take only the best from it.
Do you foresee that AI could one day 
replace you as a writer?
At this time, I would equate the 
contribution of AI in my field to a 
randomization function, comparable 
to laying out a deck of cards, each of 
which could define a character, a scene, 
etc. For example, one of them could be 
“the king of the bad guys, he is next to a 
tower" and from there, I could develop a 
character, a plot.
I believe that creativity could eventually 
happen outside of human beings. So 
I can imagine that AI will be able to 
create a book worthy of the name, but 
certainly not in its current form. These 
will be different kinds of machines, 
which we have not yet thought up. 
Does this mean you have no 
apprehensions about AI?
Determining whether AI is a threat or a 
benefit is entirely a human responsibility. 
There are many simplistic ideas about AI, 
how it works, and why it could be a threat 
to humanity. One could even say that 
there is an exaggerated anxiety focused 
on losing control of the machine. At the 
stage where we are today, this is not an 
effective way of thinking.
On the other hand, it is imperative to 
choose the direction that AI will take and 
to decide how it will be used. If we decide 
to invest in supermachines for economic 
or political warfare, we are taking the 
path of building a hostile environment, 
of course. Society must make the right 
decisions for the implementation of AI.
Today’s computers do not produce 
meaning, and human intervention 
is always necessary in the creative 
process, even if technological devices 
are becoming more refined and 
approaching human capabilities.
In my novel, Lady of Mazes, there is a 
scene where AI is going insane and 
sets up a kind of creativity bomb that 
fuels millions and millions of novels of 
exceptional quality, literally too many 
for people to read in all their collective 
lifetimes! And so, what happens to 
humans? Well, they adapt and continue 
their own creation.
Imagine that this creative bomb were to 
explode today. Why would that prevent 
me from continuing to write new books? 
Why should I think “me against a million 
books” and not “me and a million books?” 
I consider creativity – whatever its origin 
– an addition, and not a subtraction, to 
our own existence.
In fact, the notion of replacement is 
inherent in the concept of value. We 
could consider that everything can be 
replaced, according to a given value. As a 
writer, I could be replaced by a computer 
that has more commercial success than 
me. But this reasoning is only valid 
if commercial success prevails in the 
value system.

A science fiction novelist, essayist and 
futurist, Karl Schroeder (Canada) is the 
author of ten novels, translated into as 
many languages. They include Ventus 
(2000), Permanence (2002), Lady of Mazes 
(2005), Crisis in Zefra (2005) and Lockstep 
(2014). He received the Netexplo Talent 
Prize at UNESCO in February 2018. 
Scene from Poetic_AI, called the world’s 
biggest AI exhibit, created entirely by 
an algorithm. The Istanbul-based new 
media agency, Ouchhh, created an AI 
to visualize countless stories, books 
and articles, about 20 million lines 
of text – all written by scientists who 
changed the world – to create this 
17-minute installation. 
Ethics? Science fiction 
has been thinking about 
all this for a century!
If one day the products of AI become 
independent of us, they will be like the 
children who leave us when the time 
comes, to lead their own lives! Our 
responsibility as parents is to nurture 
them and to instil positive values. This is 
the cornerstone of the argument.
Is this related to the question of ethics?
Yes, science fiction has been thinking 
about all this for a century! Policymakers 
and society are only just beginning to 
think about these issues. It’s because we 
aren’t seriously examining the subject 
that we resort to free-wheeling every 
time a major technological innovation 
is introduced. Even so, the solution is 
simple – we must decide to implement 
a new technology only after having 
identified its social impact, determined 
its use and legislated accordingly.
I made this issue one of the messages in 
Lady of Mazes – to encourage us to plan 
the implementation of any technological 
innovation, to better anticipate 
societal changes.
What will be the message of your 
next book?
It will undoubtedly deal with the 
future of politics and decision-making 
processes, and also the technological 
means that could take us to another 
level of civilization.
That’s a joke, but I am thinking of writing 
it with a pen! It will be an experiment 
of use, just like the ones that digital 
tools offer us. We must be able to 
distinguish writing from the means of 
writing. Technology is only a means, 
and it must be put back in its proper 
place. There is nothing we need to 
give up about what we are or what we 
want to be – we only have to prepare 
ourselves collectively.

This is why the New South Wales 
(NSW) Department of Education 
initiated Education for a Changing 
World in 2016. Examining the strategic 
implications of technological advances, 
this comprehensive project aims to 
stimulate and inform necessary reforms 
in curricula, teaching and assessment, 
and to orient the entire system towards 
a more innovative approach. 
Leslie Loble
To the three basic pillars of any 
education system – reading, 
writing, arithmetic – we must 
now add three others: empathy, 
creativity and critical thinking. 
These skills, usually acquired 
outside school, must be 
included in school curricula, 
as artificial intelligence (AI) 
becomes part of our societies. 
In Australia, 300,000 children begin 
their school journey this year, in 2018. 
Graduating from school in 2030, they 
will spend most of their working lives 
in the second half of the twenty-first 
century – some may even live to see the 
dawn of the twenty-second century. The 
pace of change wrought by advancing 
technologies makes it increasingly likely 
that these children will live and work in a 
world that is radically different from ours. 
Education systems must move swiftly to 
anticipate and adjust to this change if 
these future generations are to thrive. 
New South Wales is the largest school 
education sector in Australia, with over 
a million children and young people 
attending some 3,000 schools. In 
every classroom, every day, a teacher 
instructs and guides these students 
toward their future. But at a system 
level, especially one of this scale, change 
can be slow to evolve, even with the 
mounting and clear urgency that new 
technology brings. 
Learning
to live in the time of AI
Since the project began, the Department 
has engaged with global leaders from 
the economic, technology and academic 
spheres, deliberations which led to the 
publication of Future Frontiers: Education 
for an AI World in November 2017. The 
book explores the future of education in 
a world with AI, and the skills needed to 
thrive in the twenty-first century.

Photo by French fine art photographer 
Vincent Fournier, taken in Barcelona, 
Spain, in 2010, as part of The Man 
Machine series, showing “speculative 
fictions”, where artificial creatures 
interact with humans. 
Some of these thought leaders got 
together with educationalists, non-
government organizations (NGOs) 
and policymakers at an international 
symposium in late 2017 to discuss how 
to use new technologies and tools to 
support teachers and improve student 
outcomes. The infusion of new ideas led 
to a unified commitment to reform. 
The new Rs
The three Rs – reading, writing and 
arithmetic – are the foundation of all 
learning, but today’s students need 
additional core skills and important 
non-cognitive skills such as self-
efficacy. The pace and breadth of 
technological change demands a 
deeper understanding of concepts, and 
a great deal of resilience, adaptability 
and flexibility for students, teachers and 
education systems as well. 
Human skills will be more important than 
ever in the new world taking shape before 
our very eyes – critical thinking will be one 
of the most powerful skills that education 
systems will impart to students.
For the time being, these essential 
skills can be acquired through extra-
curricular activities, where we learn 
about cooperation, goal-setting and 
planning, for example. Discipline and 
team spirit could be developed through 
sports, creativity through drama, critical 
thinking through debate, and empathy 
through fundraising for the Red Cross or 
volunteering at a youth group.
The challenge is how to create this wide 
range of opportunities for all students, 
how to value them as legitimate 
experiences and integrate them into our 
curricula, and how to assess students in 
these domains – which were previously 
not considered part of school education.
One thing is certain – the future 
will demand that children develop 
connections with one another and foster 
a sense of community, citizenship and 
collaboration based on empathy, which 
some believe is a key competency for the 
twenty-first century.
Interpersonal competencies are 
increasingly recognized as a crucial 
component for education systems 
around the globe. Organizations 
including UNESCO and the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) are developing 
frameworks, standards and assessments 
for intrapersonal competencies, and 
concepts such as global skills to support 
greater cross-cultural collaboration. In 
Australia, a set of general capabilities 
including critical and creative thinking 
and intercultural understanding were 
included in the national curriculum in 
2009 – since then, many jurisdictions 
have added them to their own curricula. 
The Education for a Changing World project 
has highlighted the imperative to foster 
innovative education practices that will 
lead to widespread gains across the system.
Already, these novel practices are 
springing up across the education 
community, seeking to motivate, engage 
and challenge students, and to harness 
the potential of advanced technology 
to lift their performance. Some of these 
practices have a stronger evidence base 
than others, which makes it difficult to 
distinguish which ones are the most 
effective.
AI in the classroom 
Drawing on lessons from national and 
international innovation best practices 
within the private and public sectors, 
the NSW Department of Education 
is examining how to better support 
educationalists to develop and accelerate 
innovative ideas. The aim is to establish 
new ways to create sustainable and 
scalable methods to extend the learning, 
capabilities and achievements of 
our students. 
AI offers significant potential within 
education, if used wisely and if it serves 
the needs of educators. Already, there 
are AI-based systems that can support 
personalized learning, freeing up teachers 
to focus on individual student needs and 
educational leadership. These systems 
are able to monitor student engagement 
and progress, and potentially suggest 
adjustments to content.
It is crucial that educators are in the driver’s 
seat when it comes to designing and 
developing AI-based systems. Teachers 
and school leaders must play a critical role 
in defining a clear purpose for AI in the 
classroom, and be trained to understand 
and utilize it effectively. Students must 
also be involved in decisions about the use 
of these technologies and educated about 
the ethical frameworks that accompany 
their use. Their future will depend on 
the policies and approaches that are 
adopted now. 
Deputy Secretary in the New South 
Wales Department of Education, 
Leslie Loble (Australia) has led 
strategy, reform and innovative 
delivery in Australia's largest and most 
diverse education sector for nearly 
two decades. She was awarded the 
Australian Financial Review/Westpac 
Top 100 Women of Influence in 2013 for 
her positive impact on Australian public 
affairs and in recognition of her role in 
education reform.

Audrey Azoulay, 
Director-General of UNESCO, 
interviewed by Jasmina Šopova
Artificial intelligence (AI) 
could help humanity 
overcome many of the 
serious social problems it 
faces. But at the same time, 
AI presents a series of complex 
challenges, particularly in terms 
of ethics, human rights and 
security. Yet, no international 
ethical framework that applies 
to all AI’s developments and 
applications currently exists. 
An international regulatory 
tool is indispensable.
The question of what skills to develop 
in order to evolve in an increasingly 
automated world will become more and 
more central. 
In the field of culture, AI is already widely 
applied: for example, 3D imaging is 
used for heritage reconstruction – as 
we will do for the old city of Mosul in 
Iraq. In the sciences too, particularly 
in our environmental programmes 
and in underwater research – for the 
classification of plankton images or 
the automatic detection and census of 
cetaceans and seabirds, for example. 
Communication and information are 
also directly dependent on advances in 
AI. UNESCO must lead this reflection on 
the benefits and risks of AI in education, 
culture, science and communication 
and information.
Making the most of artificial 
intelligence 
Audrey Azoulay
Why is UNESCO interested in AI?
The experts are unanimous: humanity is 
on the threshold of a new era. Artificial 
intelligence will transform our lives to 
an extent that we cannot imagine. This 
transformation has already begun and it 
affects all aspects of our lives. AI has many 
applications in fields as varied as health, 
education, culture, security, defence, 
etc. Research has increased considerably 
in recent years: the giants of the web, 
FAMGA, but also many countries, are now 
investing massively in AI, and becoming 
actors of this “Fourth Industrial Revolution”.
UNESCO has a significant role to play 
in these changing times. First, because 
AI’s applications directly affect the 
Organization’s areas of expertise. 
Education will be profoundly transformed 
by AI. Teaching tools, ways of learning, 
access to knowledge, and teacher 
training will be revolutionized.

Robots and Ethics
The COMEST Report on 
Robotics Ethics, 2017
Robotics today is increasingly 
based on artificial intelligence 
(AI) technology, where robots are 
endowed with cognitive or human-
like abilities such as perception, 
the use of language, interaction, 
problem-solving, learning and 
even creativity. The main feature 
of these cognitive robots is that 
their decisions are unpredictable, 
and their actions depend on 
stochastic (random) situations and 
on experience. 
This is very different from 
deterministic robots, whose 
behaviour is determined by 
the programmes that control 
their actions. The question of 
accountability of the actions of 
cognitive robots is therefore crucial 
– especially as these have an impact 
on human behaviours, induce social 
and cultural changes, and raise 
questions about safety, privacy and 
human dignity. 
In its Report on Robotics Ethics, 
published in November 2017, 
UNESCO’s World Commission on the 
Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and 
Technology (COMEST) proposes a 
technology-based ethical framework 
for developing recommendations on 
the ethics of robotics – based on the 
distinction between deterministic 
and cognitive robots. 
The report further identifies ethical 
values and principles that could 
help establish regulations in the 
robotics field, at all levels and in a 
coherent manner – ranging from 
codes of conduct for engineers to 
national laws and international 
conventions. The values and 
principles highlighted include 
human dignity, autonomy, privacy, 
safety, responsibility, beneficence 
and justice. The principle of human 
responsibility is the common thread 
that links the different values 
examined in this report.
COMEST also makes a series 
of specific recommendations 
concerning the application of robotic 
technologies. These include the 
further development of codes of 
ethics for roboticists, and warnings 
against the development and use of 
autonomous weapons. 
What are the risks, in your view? 
In general, AI can be a fantastic 
opportunity to achieve the goals set by the 
2030 Agenda, but that means addressing 
the ethical issues it presents, without 
further delay. An opportunity, because its 
applications can help us to advance more 
rapidly towards the achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
– by allowing better risk assessment; 
enabling more accurate forecasting and 
faster knowledge-sharing; by offering 
innovative solutions in the fields of 
education, health, ecology, urbanism and 
the creative industries; and by improving 
standards of living and our daily 
well-being. But it is also a threat, because 
automation and digitization create new 
imbalances. They can decrease diversity 
in cultural industries, disrupt the labour 
market, create job insecurity and increase 
disparities between those who have 
access to these new technologies and 
those who are deprived of them.
This is where UNESCO also has a role to 
play – in trying to reduce the inequalities 
in access to knowledge and research 
– through the support it provides to 
its Member States. The technological 
divide is likely to have a multiplier effect 
on social inequalities. UNESCO must be 
able to help its Member States adapt to 
new realities and access technological 
knowledge.
How can UNESCO provide this support, 
concretely?
One of the challenges for Member 
States is to have sophisticated, 
cutting-edge engineering materials 
and adequate human resources – 
scientists and engineers. Through its 
Centres for Education and Training in 
Science, Technology and Innovation 
(STI), its Global Observatory of 
Science, Technology and Innovation 
Policy Instruments (GO-SPIN) and its 
International Basic Sciences Programme 
(IBSP), UNESCO is in a position to provide 
such support – and to help reduce 
disparities between countries. 
What are the challenges posed by AI in 
education? How does UNESCO intend to 
respond to these?
This is, of course, a key area for the 
Organization. Here again, the revolution 
that is now underway is generating both 
positive and negative effects. 
Educational software based on AI is 
already being used to decentralize 
teaching and personalize it, and to 
provide students with curriculum 
advice, or even certification. But these 
technologies are expensive and therefore 
inaccessible to the great majority – the 
gap between rich and poor is likely to 
widen even further.
UNESCO has a 
significant role to play in 
these changing times.

As a result of its coordinating role in 
the SDG-Education 2030 Steering 
Committee to monitor the achievement 
of Sustainable Development Goal 4, 
dedicated to education, UNESCO is in an 
excellent position to lead this work – by 
identifying the possible contributions of 
AI to inclusive education and assessing 
its potential impact on the future 
of learning.
Promoting open-access AI tools that will 
encourage local innovation will be one 
of our priorities.
To prepare future generations for 
the new landscape of work that AI is 
creating, it will also be necessary to 
rethink educational programmes, with 
an emphasis on science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics – but 
also giving a prominent place to the 
humanities and to competencies in 
philosophy and ethics.

What is the relationship between AI and 
philosophy or ethics?
In their adult lives, today's 
schoolchildren and students will 
undoubtedly have to face problems 
that are currently unfathomable to us. 
It is difficult to predict all the possible 
developments of these increasingly 
sophisticated machines that are gaining 
a little more autonomy each day – to 
the point of already challenging human 
identity, to a certain extent. This is why 
skills in ethics, but also in the social 
sciences and the humanities in general, 
will be just as important as those in 
the formal sciences. There may also be 
embedded biases – including gender 
biases – in AI systems, that require more 
transparency from these systems and 
strong ethical principles to correct them.
Why is it difficult to predict future 
developments in AI?
Research in the field of AI is advancing 
at a very rapid pace, while the legal, 
social and ethical environments that 
are needed to guide it are evolving 
very slowly. How far can a machine’s 
autonomy and its decision-making 
power be allowed to go? If an accident 
occurs, who is responsible? And who 
decides what values are instilled in 
machines during what is called their 
“training”? These and many other 
questions remain unanswered today.
It was noticed, for example, that 
algorithms trained in ordinary human 
language had acquired prejudices 
based on stereotypes from textual 
data present in our everyday culture. 
How can we not be concerned about 
the danger of the emergence of 
machines with discriminatory, racist or 
hostile behaviours?
There are also many other reasons to be 
concerned about – privacy protection 
and targeted advertising on the internet; 
freedom of expression and censorship 
algorithms; automated journalism and 
information monopolies, etc.
Even if fundamental research in this 
field is largely motivated by well-being, 
unintentional, but also intentional, 
deviations are always possible. That 
is why it is imperative to ensure that 
this technology develops according to 
rigorously established ethical standards.
Whose AI is it anyway?
Human Decisions: Thoughts on AI, 2018.
With the phenomenon of big data and the transition of deep learning 
mechanisms, artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the most talked-about 
technological trends, because of its repercussions on people and cultures. 
The technological aspects of AI are fascinating, but some fear that AI may 
eventually eclipse human intelligence. Even if we accept the idea that AI will help 
the advance of humanity, we must anticipate the dangers if humans lose control 
of the technology, and be aware of the ethical implications of this.
Netexplo, an independent observatory which works in partnership with UNESCO, 
is carefully scrutinizing this vast subject – which encompasses philosophy, 
mathematics, science, computer science and engineering. In 2015, UNESCO and 
Netexplo created a common Advisory Board (UNAB) – a network of professors, 
lecturers and researchers from the world’s leading universities to analyse trends in 
digital technology, and AI in particular.
In 2018, UNAB published Human Decisions: Thoughts on AI, a collection of analyses 
that aims to stimulate thinking on the critical challenges of AI and understand 
their key workings. 
One pervasive concern that is examined from different perspectives across the 
book is whether humans deliberately entrust their decision-making powers to 
the AI. Is the AI a substitute for humans? What are the potential measures to 
safeguard us from the abuse of AI? These questions are discussed in addition to 
the points of view developed by Netexplo, by comparing different scenarios. 
Beyond these perspectives, the question about decision-making recur in a 
haunting way. Have we already given up the authority of controlling the machine? 
What if the AI ends up controlling the behaviour of humans without their 
participation? In this case, who, or what, will be in charge of the decision-making? 
While some experts fear that the influence of AI could lead us to an 
interconnected system where our own intelligence is subordinated to that of 
machines, others remain convinced that our current level of the knowledge of 
computer science is too limited to justify such a fear of the unknown. According to 
the latter group, it is not a question of competition, but of cooperation, between 
AI and humans.
What can UNESCO do in this regard?
If we are to make the most of the 
possibilities offered by AI to the world, 
we must ensure that it serves humanity, 
with respect for human dignity and 
human rights.
Yet, no international ethical framework 
that applies to all AI developments and 
applications currently exists.
UNESCO is this unique universal forum 
with over twenty years of experience in 
developing international instruments 
related to bioethics and the ethics of 
science and technology*. It can also 
rely on the expertise of two advisory 
bodies working actively on these issues: 
the World Commission on the Ethics of 
Scientific Knowledge and Technology 
(COMEST) and the International 
Bioethics Committee (IBC).
It is our responsibility to lead a universal 
and enlightened debate – not a technical 
debate, but an ethical one – in order to 
enter this new era with our eyes wide 
open, without sacrificing our values, and 
to make it possible, if Member States 
so wish, to establish a common global 
foundation of ethical principles.

The terms marked with an asterisk 
are defined in this glossary
Algorithms
The word is derived from the 
name of the ninth-century Persian 
mathematician, Muhammad ibn Musa 
al-Khwarizmi, who introduced decimal 
numbers to the West. Today it means 
a series of instructions that must be 
executed automatically by a computer. 
Algorithms are at work in all areas, from 
search-engine queries and the selection 
of information suggested to internet 
users, to financial markets.
Artificial life
An interdisciplinary field of research 
that aims to create artificial systems 
inspired by living systems, in the form of 
computer programmes or robots. 
Augmented man 
A transhumanist* ideal, the augmented 
man is an individual who has been 
subjected to modifications aimed 
at enhancing his performance, 
thanks to interventions on the body 
based on scientific or technological 
principles. Part-man, part-machine, 
the individual would be able to run 
faster, see well in the dark, withstand 
pain, possess enhanced intellectual 
abilities, resist illness or death, etc. 
The “repaired man” already exists and 
“connected” prostheses are getting 
better every day. The augmented man 
is gradually becoming a reality, with 
the development of artificial external 
skeletons used for military purposes.
Augmented reality
The superimposition of virtual elements 
onto reality, calculated by a computer 
system in real time (such as sounds, 
2D and 3D video images, etc.). This 
technique is used in video games and 
cinema, where the spectator interacts 
with virtual objects through sensors. It is 
also used for geolocation and heritage 
applications. For instance, the Cluny 
Abbey in France uses augmented reality 
screens, so visitors can visualize the town 
as it was in the fifteenth century.
A lexicon
for artificial intelligence
Big data
A set of digital data that, through its 
volume, surpasses human intuition and 
analytical abilities. We generate some 
2.5 trillion bytes of data every day on 
the internet, through emails, videos, 
weather information, GPS signals, 
online transactions, etc. No traditional 
computerized database management 
tool can process this mass of data – it 
has required the development of 
new algorithms* to store, classify and 
analyse it.
Bioconservative
For transhumanists,* people who 
criticize their ideal, augmented man are 
bioconservatives – regressive individuals 
who refuse to change the laws of life and 
nature, even though technology makes 
it possible to do so. 
Cloud
Different computer systems involving a 
large number of computers connected 
to each other, and exchanging messages 
in real time over the internet. A 
calculation or the storage of information 
launched by one computer can 
therefore be carried out by a network 
of interconnected computers – thus 
creating a cloud.
Deep learning
At the cutting edge of machine 
learning*, this technique enables a 
machine to independently recognize 
complex concepts such as faces, human 
bodies, or images of cats. This is done 
by scouring millions of images picked 
from the internet – images that have not 
been labelled by humans. The result of 
a combination of learning algorithms 
and formal neural networks* and the 
use of mass data, deep learning has 
revolutionized artificial intelligence. 
It has countless applications, including 
search engines, medical diagnosis, 
autonomous cars, etc. In 2015, the 
AlphaGo computer used deep learning 
to beat humans at Go, the ancient 
Chinese board game. 
Formal neural networks
These are algorithms designed to be 
implemented by a computer, which 
aims to replicate the neural connections 
of the brain. Existing systems are much 
more limited than human intelligence. 
But they are still capable of estimating 
the speed of a vehicle according to 
movements of the accelerator pedal and 
the slope of the road; the hardness of 
a material as a function of its chemical 
composition and its processing 
temperature; or the solvency of a 
business according to its turnover, etc.

Internet of Things
A computing concept that describes 
the idea of everyday objects or 
places in the physical world that are 
connected to the internet, and are 
able to identify themselves to other 
devices. A connected object gathers 
data (temperature, speed, humidity, 
etc.) through sensors, and sends 
it, via the internet, for computer 
analysis. The object might be a vehicle, 
a watch, an industrial machine or 
even a parking space.
Machine learning 
A machine uses an automatic learning 
programme to solve problems from 
examples, enabling it to compare 
and classify data, and even recognize 
complex shapes. Before the advent of 
deep learning* in 2010, this type of 
programme needed to be overseen 
by humans – each image had to be 
explicitly designated as containing 
a human face, a cat’s head, etc., 
so that the machine could perform 
the requested recognition operation.
Mind uploading
According to transhumanists*, our 
sensations, thoughts and emotions can 
all be summed up as neural connections. 
Mind uploading is the transhumanist 
idea that the “contents” of the human 
brain can be reduced to a set of 
information that could be translated 
into binary computer code, and thus 
uploaded into a computer.
Neo-connectionism
A theory arising from the fields of 
cognitive science and neuroscience, 
neo-connectionism proposes to develop 
computer models that aim to simulate 
learning by formal neural networks*, the 
organization and functioning of which 
have been designed by analogy with 
physiological neural systems. 
Semantic knowledge representation 
Algorithms* to formulate a sentence 
written in any language (for example, 
“Paul takes the bus to Berlin”) in logical 
form, so that a computer is able to 
interpret it. The machine can then make 
logical inferences (like deductions) that 
enable it to classify words into different 
categories and analyse the sentences 
submitted to it. 
Transhumanism
A movement whose followers want 
to reach the “post-human” condition 
by eliminating disabilities, suffering, 
illness, ageing and death, through the 
“NBIC convergence” (the convergence 
of nanotechnology, biotechnology, 
information technology and cognitive 
science). They promote the use 
of human cloning, virtual reality*, 
hybridization between humans and 
machines and mind uploading*. Their 
opponents accuse them of excessive 
speculation, of founding a new mystical 
order which idolizes technology, and of 
fantasizing about a “superhuman” with 
eugenicist overtones.
Weak AI/ Strong AI or Artificial 
General Intelligence (AGI)
Weak AI or Artificial Narrow Intelligence 
(ANI) is the only form of AI that humanity 
has achieved so far – machines that 
are capable of performing certain 
precise tasks autonomously but without 
consciousness, within a framework 
defined by humans and following 
decisions taken by humans alone. 
Strong AI or AGI would be a machine 
that has consciousness and feelings, and 
is capable of providing solutions for any 
kind of problem – that is pure fiction, 
for now. 
Human cryogenics
The technique for the conservation of a 
human body or head in liquid nitrogen, 
after an individual’s death, with the aim 
of resuscitating it one day.
Hybridization between humans 
and machines 
This process allows a connection 
between the human body and a 
technological system. The connection 
can be physical, like a mind-controlled 
prosthetic arm, or virtual, like Google 
glasses, which are voice-controlled 
and which display information or 
images in a corner of the lenses that are 
superimposed on our usual vision.
Immersive virtual reality 
A virtual, computer-generated universe, 
into which the user is immersed via 
various sensors or objects (glasses, 
sensory feedback suits, etc.). Immersion 
in virtual reality may involve the player 
of a video game or an aircraft pilot in 
training.

The photo series How much can you 
carry? started in Ethiopia in 2012, 
and continues to grow. It is currently 
spread over four continents and 
ten countries, including Bolivia, 
Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Nepal and 
Rwanda, and is represented in sixty 
photographs.
How much
can you carry ?
Photos: Floriane de Lassée
Text: Sibylle d’Orgeval
Along the asphalt strips, on the 
endless dirt roads, where the haze of 
heat shrouds the horizon, improbable 
silhouettes walk. From East Africa to the 
far reaches of the Himalayas, the bodies 
of these walkers are extended vertically 
by a stack of things – indistinguishable 
for those who pass them in cars, the 
drivers too preoccupied by the road, and 
trying not to knock them over. Whether 
the torso is straight or bent over by the 
weight, the head is always held high, 
oblivious of the rickety old cars speeding 
by. Modern-day caryatids! 
On the other side of the window, caught 
up in a hurried world that scorns the 
slow pace of the porters, we are mere 
spectators of these lives that pass by. 
But Floriane de Lassée, traveller and 
photographer, decided to stop rushing, 
to take the time to meet them – only 
to discover that these balancing artists 
are carrying much more than just a can, 
a jug or a bag of clothes; much more 
than they need to survive. They carry the 
weight of life. 
Her series, called How much can you 
carry? is actually a question posed as a 
challenge: “Show me how much you can 
carry! Show me who you are!” 
A question to which the French 
photographer responds with humour 
and depth. Who would have thought 
that a little girl could carry a stack of 
firewood on her head with a young goat 
perched on top? Are we stronger than 
we think we are? Do these objects just 
rest on their heads, or do they emerge 
from them, as if they were the expression 
of their unconscious, as if suddenly the 
“outside” illustrated what was “inside”? 
In Indonesia, on Putrie’s head, is this 
mountain of horns, a symbol of power 
and wealth, real? Was it put there by the 
elders, who pass on this burden to her? 
Or did it emerge from a brain already 
well aware of her future responsibilities?
De Lassée takes the opposite view to the 
usual imagery of downcast heads and 
curved spines and goes beyond the cliché 
of the forced labourer, crushed by work. 
No matter what the load, the head is 
always proud and the smile, bright. As if, 
at the time when their photographs were 
taken, everyone was mocking destiny. 
Life is a balancing act, and Floriane’s 
photos take us beyond all gravity! While 
contemplating so many loads carried with 
gaiety, let us imagine for a moment that 
we could play with our own burdens, and 
come away so much lighter!
Barely out of breath,

on her head.

Ideas
The UNESCO Courier • July-September 2018   |   51 
We humans are therefore influenced, in 
a sense, by the very principle that nails 
us to the ground.
This idea of influence – passing from a 
cosmogonic, or mythical, conception, to 
a cosmological, or scientific, conception, 
and passing from astrology to astronomy 
– was revisited in the nineteenth century 
by the Bonapartist scholar, Pierre-Simon 
de Laplace, in the form of mechanical 
determinism. This determinism is 
illustrated by this famous sentence from 
his philosophical essay on probabilities: 
“We ought then to regard the present 
state of the universe as the effect of its 
anterior state and as the cause of the one 
which is to follow. Given for one instant, 
an intelligence which could comprehend 
all the forces by which nature is 
animated and the respective positions 
of the beings which compose it – an 
intelligence sufficiently vast to submit 
this data to analysis – it would embrace 
in the same formula the movements of 
the greatest bodies in the universe and 
those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing 
would be uncertain, and the future, as 
the past, would be present to its eyes.” 
In other words, we believe that we are 
free and autonomous subjects, even 
though we are the objects of the events 
that preceded us, and therefore remain 
under their influence.
But then, is it the effect of chance, or of an 
epistemological and ideological moment, 
that during the reign of Napoleon 
(1804-1815), and at the very moment 
when he restored slavery and deployed 
intensive colonization, other scholars, like 
George Cuvier, seize this deterministic 
conception, adopt it by applying it to 
the notion of human races, thus creating 
a scientific racism, in which scholars 
with dire reputations – like Gobineau, 
Friedrich Blumenbach, Houston Stewart 
Chamberlain and Vacher de Lapouge – 
engulfed themselves? 
Dancing the
unspeakable 
or the question of how the memory of slavery 
influences contemporary artistic creation 
Alain Foix
The artist Alain Foix takes 
a philosophical look at the 
relationship between history, 
memory and artistic creation. 
Thanks to his art, the artist is not 
assigned a skin colour and not 
irredeemably condemned to 
dance an unspeakable history. 
Instead, he is part of a dialectic: 
he is both free and possessed. By 
creating, he becomes the master 
of his own history, which allows 
him to overcome the past. His 
artistic intelligence must be 
seen as a “ruse” that produces 
a new influence on the world 
and, by creating an open and 
indeterminate work, encourages 
the sharing of cultures.
With this article, the UNESCO Courier 
marks the International Day for the 
Remembrance of the Slave Trade 
and its Abolition, on 23 August. 
Its first commemoration took 
place twenty years ago, in 1998, in 
honour of the 1791 insurrection in 
Santo Domingo (now Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic), which played 
a decisive role in the abolition of 
the transatlantic slave trade.
Influence: “the action by which a fluid 
flows from the stars, which is supposed 
to act on human destiny”. That was the 
original meaning of the word. According 
to the theory of universal gravitation, the 
stars exert an influence on each other 
according to their respective masses, and 
this influence is produced by gravitational 
waves which, in a certain way, correspond 
to the fluid of the Ancients.

All of them confined these races in 
the historical determination of their 
constitutions.
And if “God does not play dice with 
the universe”, to use Einstein's famous 
quote, there would be, in the order of 
this universal harmony, a logic in things 
– according to which there would be 
the chosen and the damned, visible 
and scientifically identifiable by their 
morphology. We know that it was such 
mechanistic thinking that encouraged 
the brutal mechanics of the industrial 
expansion of slavery.

Unfortunately, long after the abolition 
of slavery, and in spite of the progress 
of science in all fields of biology, 
anthropology and hard sciences like 
physics and astrophysics, this conception 
endures in our minds even today, and 
filters our cultural background. Have we 
not heard, on television and in the media, 
about the “curse of the Haitian people”, 
following the earthquake that struck Haiti 
in 2010 – thus associating a theological 
thought with a tectonic phenomenon 
linked to economic, political and social 
causes? As if the event remained under 
the influence of a past coming from 
some primal condition, whose cause is 
age-old. This obviously makes it possible 
not to take into account the colonial issue 
and the political and economic history 
which controls the destiny of this island 
even today.
Let us be wary, then, of the notion of 
influence, which, like a double-edged 
sword can wound those who wield it. 
Because not being wary could lead to this 
return of meaning that would imply we 
are determined – condemned to paint, 
dance, sing, play and film to infinity, this 
backdrop that constitutes the residual 
memory of the inhuman deflagration that 
made us what we are. Condemned to 
dance the unspeakable.
So let us be careful not to adopt this 
determinist and racist conception of 
human beings, to the point of making 
those among us who are capable of 
artistic expression – the storytellers and 
painters – the prisoners of our history. 
For a non-deterministic 
history
Because the history of slavery is not 
our Big Bang – that first moment from 
which everything flows mechanically and 
irreversibly – because there is a past, that 
is the pre-colonial history of Africa and 
the Americas. And something beyond: 
the future to be built. Science and new 
conceptions of history have allowed us 
to discard this dangerous mechanical 
determinism and its conception 
of influence.
In the middle of the last century, Werner 
Heisenberg introduced the notion 
of indeterminacy, or the uncertainty 
principle, into quantum physics. It means 
that an object is never anything but an 
object for a subject, and the subject 
who observes, separated ontologically 
from the observed object, cannot grasp 
it without knowing that he exerts an 
influence on it and he must take this 
influence into account. There is therefore 
no absolute and determined object, nor 
absolute subject, but a relationship. A 
relationship induced by the action, the 
movement, the thought of the subject 
himself in his relation to the object.
But what would be the nature of this 
relationship, of this influence, if the 
subject himself were determined, under 
the influence of a cause preceding him? 
It would simply be non-existent and 
understandable only in a mathematical 
equation. The principle of indeterminacy – 
which supposes a new, non-deterministic 
mode between us and our universe – 
therefore implies that the subject himself is 
indeterminate, that his action and thought 
are not subject to mechanical causality. In 
other words, the subject is free, in motion, 
in progress. And therefore he releases the 
object from himself. The object, through 
this dialectical indeterminacy of the 
relationship, regains its autonomy.
Beyond memory, 
being the subject of 
one's own history
This freedom is, in fact, that of our action 
within our own history. A history of which 
we are no longer the thinking objects, 
but the acting subjects. Although we are 
acting ourselves, by our own actions. No 
longer objects of a history that compels 
us to think through it, but subjects of a 
history that is built with us and by us.
We must therefore think of history, our 
history, no longer through the framework 
of the determinists, but with Hegel 
and his conception of the subject of 
history. Hegel, whose famous dialectic 
of the master and the slave is simply an 
illustration of the consequences of taking 
possession of one’s own history by the 
subject who emancipates himself from it.
Our history and our memory influence 
us only to the extent that we ourselves 
influence it. From then on, this cosmic 
backdrop that is our memory is no longer 
our only horizon. We escape from this 
black hole to discover its relativity. We 
escape it to become ourselves, to create 
a new time that is none other than ours. 
This time of my being, of my action, 
which is none other than myself. I am 
time in action. I am its expression.

This trap, this cosmic net that could 
become my memory, closes in on the 
person I no longer am. It closes on a past 
history, put into perspective. A history 
that is now mine, that belongs to me, 
but of which I am no longer a prisoner. 
I become master of my history, because 
I have opened its horizon. Torn its net.
I am no longer condemned to dance the 
unspeakable, because as master of my time, 
master of myself, I am also master of my 
choices and my expression. I am a free and 
autonomous subject, emancipated from 
my memory, and my expression cannot be 
read and acted only through the prism of 
my past, whether individual or collective. 
I have opened the field of possibilities.
In other words, there is no moral or 
intellectual obligation for a black artist to 
paint the blackness of his history, since 
he is a free and autonomous subject and 
recognized as such.
The artist, whoever he may be, can no 
longer be considered the instrument 
of expression of a sponsor who would 
be his master – master of a subject to 
be depicted and expressed, master of 
a history and a cosmogony, master of 
an ethic and an aesthetic, master of a 
vision and a conception of the world 
bequeathed by a history of which 
we are prisoners – but as the acting 
subject, autonomous and free in his own 
expression, his own vision of the world, 
his own history. 
It is then necessary for us to reconsider his 
work differently, through other aesthetic, 
ethical and political prisms. Given this 
freedom acquired over the determinisms 
of history, we must grasp the work of 
every artist, not as a forced expression 
of himself and his memory, but as the 
expression of a deliberate act, to which 
he gives meaning and existence.
The dialectic of 
the artist and his work
We can then perceive the artist in the 
dialectical order of a subject vis-à-vis 
his work, in the subject/object dialectic. 
This work is a differentiated expression, it 
expresses a differance – and we write this 
word with an a as Derrida does, because 
it is the act of differing, of coming out of 
oneself, of one's own time; something 
that is not oneself, or not entirely oneself. 
An expressive distance from oneself. 
The act of artistic creation is therefore 
critical because it expresses a crisis. Krisis 
in Greek means “separation, distinction”. 
But crisis also means, originally in French, 
“a decision, a choice”. This crisis is the 
dialectical moment of giving birth to 
something that comes from oneself, 
but is not self. This differance is an 
offering of oneself to what is not self, to 
the other. It produces an object, but a 
subjective object. What is meaningful 
in the work is that gift, which opens the 
possibility of sharing between the other 
and oneself – it is in this sharing that 
expression is found. In this relationship 
between subjects through a subjective 
object, which by nature engages a silent 
dialogue between the two.
Thus, because it is freely chosen by the 
autonomous subject who presents it to 
be seen, makes it a gift and an object 
of sharing with the other-spectator, the 
work itself acquires its autonomy, its own 
meaning, even its enigmatic quality, its 
indeterminacy, and can become an object 
of comprehension and understanding, 
differentiated from its author. This is why 
some authors can say that once the work 
is created, it no longer belongs to them – 
it is offered in its entirety to the universal 
of aesthetic input.
The artist, both free 
and influenced
It is precisely this established freedom that 
gives value to the gift, to the artist’s offering 
of his work. It gives him the capacity 
to create, literally – that is, to produce 
something new from the old, to generate 
mutations of form. It is by reformulating 
material, namely a history sedimented in 
cultural, aesthetic or even ethical memory, 
that he produces meaning.
If an artist does so, it is because he is able, 
by choice, to bring his own liberated, 
autonomous energy to the residual 
memory that constitutes culture. His 
energy is his formal action, his power to 
work, in the sense that Aristotle defines 
the word energeia (literally “that which is 
fully at work”, but also “that which gives 
form, that does the work”) – form and 
energy being the same thing in reality, as 
physics attests.
We can thus say, starting from this 
energeia, that the artist is an oddball, a 
being possessed, one who is “worked” 
on. One could also say, starting from the 
verb energeio, that he is influenced. But 
then, how can the artist be simultaneously 
free, autonomous, emancipated 
and influenced? This is an apparent 
contradiction, resolved by the simple fact 
that the artist is an artist, free to choose his 
influence, free to let himself be possessed 
and be worked on by a dimension of 
the collective memory that he makes his 
own. And it is at this price, because he 
is free, that he can impose his own form 
and possess what possesses him, overlap 
what overlaps him. This choice is precisely 
what, in the Sartrean sense, can be called a 
commitment. He engages himself entirely 
in his chosen material; he takes the risk 
because this material possesses him. And 
if he is possessed by it, it is because he 
perceives in himself a necessity, a lack that 
he needs to fill.
This is how we must consider the residual 
memory of the history of slavery: as 
material for the artist who wants to 
grapple with it.
What the artist will produce from his 
work is what Aristotle calls entelechy 
(from entelecheia, the realization or 
complete expression of some function). 
A finality of form, in a way, produced by 
the energy-form of the artist who gives 
the work its autonomy.

But the work, which is not him, but 
which has emerged from him, remains 
a question, a form questioning the very 
enigma of history, questioning also this 
present in which this memory subsists.
So isn’t this work, which “journeys to its 
end” the act of this oddball who seeks to 
put an end to this memory inside him, 
to end this history with a new form that 
illuminates the past while leaving it in its 
place, by literally going beyond it?
A ruse of artistic 
intelligence
Thus the artist chooses his influence by 
exercising his artistic freedom precisely in 
order not to remain under the influence 
of the past and to produce the present 
instead. When we speak, for example, of 
the influence of African art or art nègre, on 
modern art – on Picasso, Braque, Derain, 
Matisse, even Apollinaire and the Surrealists 
– it means understanding it, not as the 
mechanical influence of an object on a 
subject, but as a relational dialogue. This 
influence arises because the artists were 
in a critical phase, questioning the forms 
inherited from their past and in search of 
new expressive materials. Thus Picasso's 
painting, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, is the 
fruit of a dialogue between a question of 
the West about its own aesthetics at a given 
moment, and African art, that we then 
discover is not “primitive” as described by 
some, but a bearer of creation and thought. 
This inspires Maillol to say that “Art nègre 
contains more ideas than Greek art”. This 
encounter therefore produces both new 
forms of expression and a fresh perspective 
on the object that introduces a new 
aesthetic dialogue: in this case, African art.
What is called influence is in fact a choice 
dictated by a need for expression. And 
in this expression, there is an overlap 
between the subject and the object, 
there is possession. We can say in this 
sense that Les Demoiselles d'Avignon 
is possessed by African art. The work 
is the product of the search for a new 
perspective, a transformation of taste, 
or as Nietzsche would say about music, 
“a renaissance in the art of listening”. He 
was captivated by Bizet's Carmen, a work 
in which he found an African dimension. 
He was fascinated by it because an 
encounter takes place between the 
opera and the philosopher who, having 
separated himself from Romanticism 
and Wagner, sought a meaningful new 
aesthetic form that opened new horizons.
To speak of influence is in fact to speak 
of a search for new forms, new formal 
contents, capable of transforming our 
way of seeing, hearing and appreciating. 
This is a fight. Artistic creation is more 
than resistance – it is a “combat sport” 
against modes of perceiving the world 
and its objects that are sedimented and 
imposed by a dominant culture. When 
Martin Luther King said that “music is our 
weapon of war” he meant just that. This 
weapon is effective not only because it 
gathers forces around it, but also because 
it is able to enter the sensibility of the 
adversary and possess it. It speaks to him 
(the adversary) and, through sensibility, 
opens horizons. This is possible because 
gospel and blues in the United States 
are part of a common foundation, which 
allows blacks to speak to whites through 
a form of sound that opens the mind 
to the content of their speech. Even the 
speeches of the civil rights leader were 
chanted in the manner of gospel songs 
– which gave them greater penetration, 
and carried them towards a universal. He 
spoke in his speeches, of course, of the 
common memory of slavery, but in a form 
that created distance from it, to speak to 
his contemporaries.
In dance, Katherine Dunham and after 
her, Lester Horton and Alvin Ailey, drew 
elements from African or Indian traditions 
and from the memory of slavery, and 
incorporated these in their creation. 
It was part of a search for new forms 
that could both illuminate the past and 
produce a new perspective. Jazz was 
born in Congo Square, a place for slaves 
to meet and dance in New Orleans in 
the US, to integrate the constituent 
elements of their memory into a new 
musical form. But it was a memory 
distanced by the form itself, and 
creating an area for a sensitive 
exchange between several forms of 
culture, several horizons.
We can then speak of a ruse of the artistic 
intelligence that integrates the old into 
the new, by going beyond the past, 
and enabling it to influence 
the way it is perceived. This is 
undoubtedly the meaning 
of métissage, hybridization 
– a movement towards 
the new that creates 
a new influence. The 
goddess Metis, the first 
wife of Zeus, whose name 
literally means “advice, 
ruse”, of whom Hesiod said 
“she knows more than any 
god or mortal man”, was able 
to influence Zeus and make him 
change his mind.
Thus the integration of memory, 
whether of slavery or any other 
memory, into a new body and a new 
form, is a ruse of artistic intelligence to 
influence the present.

Voyage (350 x 300 x 300 cm), an assemblage of flip-
flops and Yoruba figurines (ibejis) evoking the slave 
trade, by Beninese artist Dominique Zinkpé, 2015.
Today’s art scene is teeming with 
examples of this in dance, music, theatre, 
art and cinema. This ruse is possible 
only as long as we accept that the 
artist has freed himself from his past 
by integrating it into his work – that, 
as a free and autonomous subject, he 
chooses this influence and is not its 
object. This also forces us to see the artist 
and his work as ontologically separate, 
although related in a certain way, chosen 
by the artist and his mode of action on 
the material of memory. It also means 
that we must look at the work as a work 
in its autonomy and in the enigma of 
its indeterminacy. It remains open, 
an object of sharing and therefore of 
differentiated judgements, of criticism.
Finally, starting from the work itself, we 
cannot induce the colour of its author. 
Do not confine the painter in his colour 
because it is not the colour of the painter 
that gives colour to his work – it is the 
work itself and the critical analyses it 
later inspires. This work that says, in 
the variety of its possibilities and in the 
infinite possibilities of its open form 
and its interpretation, what Lamartine 
said, fighting against the abomination 
of slavery: "I am the colour of those 
who are persecuted.”
A writer, playwright, director and philosopher from Guadeloupe, Alain Foix is 
the founder of Quai des Arts, a multidisciplinary company that combines live 
performance with new technologies of image and sound. He is the author of 
several books, including Je danse donc je suis (I dance therefore I am, 2007); Histoires 
de l’esclavage racontées à Marianne (Stories of slavery told to Marianne, 2007); Noir : 
de Toussaint Louverture à Barack Obama (Black: from Toussaint Louverture to Barack 
Obama, 2009); Martin Luther King (2012) and Che Guevara (2015). His theatrical works 
include Vénus et Adam (2004), Pas de prison pour le vent (No prison for the wind, 
2006) and La dernière scène (The last scene, 2012), a private conversation between 
Martin Luther King, his wife Coretta and American activist Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Why did you choose documentary film as 
a medium of expression?
More than fiction, documentary film is 
capable of countering national myths. 
Not to destroy them, but to put them 
in their place, so that they do not crush 
society. If you do not film your own 
reality, how will you be able to watch 
yourself? Where would your inspiration 
come from? Where would your dreams 
come from? Also, do we need to be 
reminded, cinema was born from the 
documentary – remember the Lumière 
brothers? The documentary film 
determines the collective imagination. 
It is this reality that nurtures fiction and 
holds up a mirror to society. I know that 
filming real life can be disturbing; but I 
also know that it matures you. 
One of the assets of democracy, press 
freedom, is the subject of your film about 
the independent Algerian newspaper, 
El Watan, released in 2015. Why did you 
call it Checks and Balances?
A free press is a democratic asset that 
many journalists paid for with their 
lives, during the civil war in Algeria. 
The war, which broke out in 1991, left 
200,000 dead and 100,000 missing. 
Around 120 Algerian journalists were 
murdered by Islamist extremists between 
1993 and 1998. But that still does not 
mean that the free press represents a real 
force of opposition in my country today.
For this film, I decided to take an 
“oblique” look, by following a team of 
journalists at work. What interested me 
was not so much the press as a counter-
force, but the counter-forces represented 
by individuals. 
Filming reality 
can be disturbing, but it matures you
Malek Bensmaïl 
Malek Bensmaïl, interviewed by Jasmina Šopova 
Three years after Algeria’s independence in 1962 – and after eight 
years of civil war – Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo shot The Battle of 
Algiers. The film is about one of the bloodiest episodes in the Algerian 
war, when Algeria’s pro-Independence National Liberation Front 
(FLN) clashed with the French colonial authorities in 1957. 
On 19 June 1965, even as the film was being shot, Colonel Houari 
Boumédiène’s FLN troops entered Algiers. Tanks being used for the 
film got mixed up with the real tanks, and President Ahmed Ben Bella’s 
supporters could see nothing but fire. As a result, he was overthrown!
Half a century later, in 2017, Malek Bensmaïl examined the historic 
role of Pontecorvo’s black-and-white newsreel-style classic in his 
documentary, The Battle of Algiers, a Film Within History. But this is 
not a “film about a film”, he explains. It is more an interpretation of his 
country’s history – the revolution, the coup, the regime changes, the 
decolonization. For almost thirty years, the Algerian director has been 
creating what he calls “the contemporary memory” of his country.
In the 1990s, when we were in the middle 
of the “black decade” in Algeria, I opted 
for reality. And I continue along that 
path. My idea is to make a film every one 
or two years, about people, institutions, 
important social issues. I would like these 
films to provide a better understanding of 
how a country is built over time. 
My intention is to create a contemporary 
memory, by showing this laboratory, 
which is Algeria – a country searching 
for its identity, with its progress, its 
setbacks, its questions. You don’t achieve 
democracy with a snap of the fingers. Or 
with guns, for that matter!

Their objective is to provide accurate 
information from balanced sources. 
Besides, most of them have websites 
that are free and accessible to everyone, 
including the diaspora. 
What is El Watan doing to preserve 
its independence? How does it ensure 
its survival? 
Through newspaper sales – it has a 
print run of 140,000 copies, which sell 
at 20 Algerian dinars (about €0.20) 
each – and through advertising. The 
paper, which has been deprived of 
advertising revenue from the state since 
1993, has invested in an advertising 
and distribution network, and in an 
independent printing facility which it 
shares with El Khabar. The paper has 
also turned to the private sector for 
advertising, which enables it to pay the 
100 journalists and correspondents that 
make up its editorial staff.
That said, the newspaper has had at least 
six interruptions in its publication, and 
has been involved in some 200 lawsuits, 
which have made it financially vulnerable. 
I was surprised to hear Omar Belhouchet, 
the paper’s founder and director, say 
that he found these court cases very 
important for the democratic process. 
I thought they were painful experiences, 
but he felt that they allowed him not only 
to defend journalists and cartoonists, 
but also to defend the very notion of the 
freedom of expression, which is written in 
the Constitution. 
These trials give him (Belhouchet) the 
opportunity to explain to the court what 
a caricature is, what humour is, what a 
chronicle is, what an investigation is, and 
where the restraints in society are. He 
actually uses these court cases to educate 
young magistrates about freedom of 
the press. 
Education is central to your 2008 
documentary, La Chine est encore loin 
(China is Still Far Away). Why do you refer 
to China when it’s about a classroom in 
a school in Tiffelfel, a small village in the 
Aurès mountains, where the Algerian war 
began, in November 1954?
The title refers to a quote from the 
Prophet Muhammad: “Seek knowledge, 
going all the way to China, if need be”. 
China is therefore a symbolic land, the 
land of knowledge, which can only be 
reached with considerable effort. A land 
that is still far away, seen from Algeria.
Just before making this film, I had shot a 
documentary on madness (Aliénations, 
2004). I spent three months in a psychiatric 
hospital and came across many cases of 
people with politico-religious delusions. 
I wondered what the origins of this 
pathology were. A psychiatrist gave me 
the answer: “It’s society”. That encouraged 
me to go and see how young people 
were being taught, what ideas were being 
passed on to them at school. So, I went 
to the school in the village where the 
Algerian war had started.
It was a very violent war, that lasted almost 
eight years. Thanks to its victory, Algeria 
has become a myth, and successive 
regimes have worked hard to consolidate 
this myth. I’m not saying it is not a good 
thing to forge a sense of national pride 
among the people, and for them to value 
their heroism. But I disagree when this is 
done in a way that is completely out of 
step with local daily life. I wanted to film 
an Algeria that works every day, that fights 
every day, under that myth. 
In Algeria, the notion of the individual has 
not yet fully developed. We are locked 
into the idea of a community. We have 
a nation to defend, a country to defend, 
a god to defend, a language to defend. 
There is always that “one” figure, which 
is omnipresent, omnipotent, which is 
supposed to include us all – while in 
reality there are celebrities, intellectuals, 
journalists, judges, students, etc., who live 
in a multicultural and multilingual space, 
who think differently and who constitute 
a set of small checks and balances 
necessary for a democracy.
What good is an independent newspaper 
if it has no impact on society?
Even when it does not constitute a 
real counter-force, the free press does 
manage to condemn the invisible acts 
of violence no one talks about. Algeria 
is currently seen as a calm country, 
protected from terrorism, but in fact it 
is not immune from humiliation and 
manipulation.
El Watan is not the only newspaper 
doing this work. There are a few others, 
including Le Quotidien d'Oran, El Khabar, 
Liberté and, to a certain extent, Le 
Soir d'Algérie, which are also involved 
in the resistance and the struggle. 
They are not opposition newspapers.

Our guest
The UNESCO Courier • July-September 2018   |   59 
The film shows the gulf that separates 
the myth from the social reality. At the 
end of the day, we realize that what we 
are teaching children is hatred of the 
other. The film also shows that Koranic 
education today is far removed from the 
words of the Prophet. Political Islamism 
has done a lot of damage that is still 
being felt today, especially in rural areas.
Is that the reason why only one woman 
– Rachida, the school cleaner – is given a 
voice in the film? 
Rachida is amazing. She gave me a 
wonderful lesson in freedom! She comes 
from another village in southern Algeria, 
from where she had to escape because 
she was divorced and was therefore 
considered a prostitute.
It was impossible to interview other 
women, even though, in this region, 
women were once known for their 
management of the economy – carpet-
making and farming were in their hands. 
Today they are hidden behind the walls 
of their houses. In the countryside, they 
hardly ever leave their homes, even veiled.
It is the men who go to market. That 
is unheard of! The years of Islamism 
and conservatism have wiped out the 
traditional social role of women, along 
with all the gains they had achieved with 
their emancipation. During the shoot, 
they sent us trays of food, cakes and 
coffee through the children, but we didn’t 
see a single woman.
Algerian film director Malek Bensmaïl 
has been making documentary films 
since 1990, while his country was going 
through the “bloody decade”. His films 
have received critical acclaim and several 
prizes at international festivals. They have 
been screened in cinemas and broadcast 
on television worldwide, on channels 
including Arte (France-Germany), 
TV Cultura (Brazil), RTBF (Belgium), TV3 
(Spain), YLE (Finland), France TV, Canal + 
(France), RTSI, RTSR (Switzerland), Channel 
Four (United Kingdom), and global 
television networks TV5 Monde and the 
BBC. In 2010, he was the Villa Kujoyama 
laureate in Kyoto, Japan. A retrospective 
of his work exhibits at leading universities 
in the United States in autumn, 2018.
“You make a film with, not about, people 
in real life,” says director Malek Bensmaïl. 
This group of students helped with the 
shooting of La Chine est encore loin.

Covering an area of 7,500 square 
kilometres, the Archipiélago de Colón 
– Galápagos Biosphere Reserve covers 
the entire land surface of the Galápagos 
National Park. 
The Galápagos are one of the best models 
of harmonious and mutually beneficial 
interaction between humans and their 
natural environment. The management 
strategy of the biosphere reserve focuses 
on food production that benefits the 
local economy, respects ecosystems 
and avoids the introduction of invasive 
species that would endanger endemic 
biodiversity.
Galápagos:
where inhabitants
take charge
What do we imagine when we think of the Galápagos? Giant turtles, 
marine iguanas, finches, Darwin and his theory of evolution? Yes, of 
course. But the Galápagos are much more than all that – they are also 
a community of 28,000 inhabitants spread around four islands: Santa 
Cruz, San Cristóbal, Isabela and Floreana. And it is thanks to its people, 
who are invested in the participatory and sustainable management of 
the resources of the archipelago that some 240,000 tourists are able to 
visit this paradise each year. Ecuador’s Archipiélago de Colón has been 
a World Heritage site since 1978 and a Biosphere Reserve listed since 
1984 in the global network managed by UNESCO.

Located a thousand kilometres from the 
mainland, the archipelago, home to one 
of the richest marine ecosystems in the 
world, includes thirteen large islands – and 
147 small islands and rocks – that were 
formed four million years ago. Most of 
these are in fact submarine volcanoes, 
some of which rise more than 3,000 metres 
from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

At the heart of the reserve, the Galápagos 
National Park is a successful example 
of participatory management, allowing 
local people to live sustainably from the 
resources offered by activities such as 
fishing, livestock, tourism or recreation, 
through judicious management plans 
that include local food production and 
waste recycling.
To take the example of coffee, a 
cooperative was created in 2015 – 
bringing together farmers, roasters and 
traders – to improve the production 
and marketing of the eight varieties of 
arabica, cultivated for a century on the 
islands, at 250 metres above sea level. 
Renowned for its flavour, Galápagos 
coffee is sold at a price that is seven 
times higher than mainland coffee. The 
pesticide-free production, harvesting and 
processing comply with environmental 
protection rules – which will soon lead 
to the certification of these varieties as 
designations of origin.
The municipal government of Santa 
Cruz island has been developing 
and coordinating initiatives for the 
recycling of solid waste for the last 
ten years. These include launching 
education and awareness programmes 
on environmental problems, banning 
the use of polyethylene materials and 
prohibiting the import of beers and soft 
drinks in non-recyclable packaging.
But all these initiatives owe their 
success primarily to the villagers, who 
take ownership of the environmental 
protection and safeguarding projects. 
Craftsmen use recyclable materials to 
make objects; masons use recycled 
blocks or glass tiles in the construction 
of houses; the fishermen are mobilizing 
for the ban of plastic nets and collect the 
waste that pollutes the sea themselves, 
while all the inhabitants regularly 
engage in cleaning up the beaches. 
Since 2017, half of the solid waste from 
the islands has been recycled through a 
waste selection and recovery programme 
in which the local population is 
actively involved.
Through the Biosphere Reserves as a 
Tool for Coastal and Island Management 
in the South-East Pacific Region 
(BRESEP) project, UNESCO's Man and the 
Biosphere Programme (MAB) is currently 
working – in collaboration with the 
Government of Ecuador, the Galápagos 
National Park and local communities 
– to extend the biosphere reserve to 
133,000 square kilometres, so that it 
includes the Galápagos Marine Reserve, 
a genuine sanctuary for marine life. At 
the confluence of several ocean currents, 
where cold and warm waters mix, it is 
home to a multitude of endemic species, 
but also to species from different areas 
of the Pacific Ocean.
Financed by the Flemish government 
of Belgium, the BRESEP project 
supports the creation of biosphere 
reserves as tools for innovative and 
socially, culturally and environmentally 
appropriate practices. It also encourages 
the establishment of a collaborative 
network for the exchange of information 
and experiences on biodiversity 
loss, coastal zone management and 
sustainable development. The project 
particularly involves the coasts and 
islands of the South-East Pacific, located 
in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama 
and Peru. These efforts are contributing 
to improved livelihoods for the people 
of the region.
Man and nature reconciled
Luc Jacquet
In March 2018, French film 
director Luc Jacquet, who won 
an Oscar for his documentary 
March of the Penguins (2005), 
travelled to the Galápagos 
with French photographer 
and film director Sarah Del 
Ben on a scouting trip for a 
future film project. They were 
accompanied by experts 
from UNESCO's Man and the 
Biosphere Programme (MAB). 
This is their experience.

This morning, as I walked through 
the alleys of Santa Cruz, I saw an old 
man reading his newspaper. A sea lion 
casually kept him company, sitting on 
the same bench. A little further away, 
men just back from fishing were selling 
fresh fish that would be eaten the same 
day. I continued on my way, meeting 
passers-by, tourists and iguanas. 
Walking only a short distance away 
from the alleys, I could see children 
playing around century-old giant 
turtles, which were grazing peacefully 
in the grass.
I've travelled the world, but I've never 
before witnessed such proximity 
between different species, except 
perhaps in Antarctica. These places, 
so far from everything, are ultimately 
the last sanctuaries of harmonious 
life between humans and nature. And 
yet, in both cases, living conditions 
are extreme.

Man and nature reconciled
For my part, I am fortunate to have 
the know-how that allows me to play 
the modest role of mediator between 
science and the general public. I can 
make images that convey messages 
with an effectiveness that is now 
proven. And I put this know-how at 
the service of the planet. That is why 
I want to support the UNESCO-MAB 
Programme – its aspirations are in line 
with mine. Its philosophy is based on 
an idea that I fully endorse, that of 
living together.
Cinema is a wonderful tool for 
awakening awareness. It uses the 
language of emotion and metaphor. 
Far from indulging in a moralizing or 
guilt-laden discourse – which has been 
proved to be relatively ineffective – a 
film acts on both the hearts and minds 
of its audience. It thus incites them to 
appropriate things of nature – because 
of their beauty, because of their 
interest, or simply out of curiosity.
Climate change and the loss of 
biodiversity are complex issues. Cinema 
is able to make them accessible to the 
public by translating them into stories 
that are both simple and universal 
in scope. This is how it opens this 
first door that leads us onto the path 
of awareness.
And when we are on this path, we 
understand what an illusion it is to 
imagine for a moment – and yet the 
last four or five generations of human 
beings have done it – that we can 
live, cut off from nature. We come 
from nature and we need nature for 
things as basic as breathing, drinking 
or eating. But we also need nature so 
that we can dream.
In the arid lands of the Galápagos, 
burned by the sun and so hostile to 
life, human activity and biodiversity are 
not in conflict. One has the impression 
of being in a life-size laboratory and 
witnessing the brilliant demonstration 
that it is possible for humans and 
animals to live together – as long 
as we put in place sound resource 
management policies that allow 
ecosystems to survive. The archipelago 
should serve as a model for the rest of 
the world, on how to bridge the gap we 
have created between ourselves and 
other living beings.
Participating in the conservation of 
ecosystems is always a complicated 
task. But above all, we must learn to 
know and love them. If each of us does 
this, using our talents and know-how, 
I am convinced our collective efforts 
will bear fruit. I deeply believe that this 
collective energy will enable us to move 
towards a way of life in which we will no 
longer be colonizers, but managers – 
and towards a society that appreciates 
the value of the planet on which it lives.

President Evo Morales, who is of 
indigenous Aymara descent, chose 
Tiwanaku as a symbolic location for the 
inauguration of each of his three terms 
as head of the Bolivian state (in 2006, 
2010 and 2015). As a result, the site 
has regained its prestige, and become 
an important tourist destination. It 
takes a lot of effort, however, for the 
visitor to appreciate and understand it 
fully. Tiwanaku is more an exercise in 
observation and documentation than in 
simple contemplation. This is because 
all that remains of the city’s majestic 
ensemble of temples and palaces are 
the ruins or partially reconstructed 
remains of seven great buildings − 
the Akapana Pyramid, the temple of 
Kantatayita, the temple of Kalasasaya, 
the Putuni Palace, the Kheri Kala Palace, 
the Puma Punku Pyramid, and the small 
semi-subterranean temple. 
With its monumental complex of 
buildings and its location at more than 
3,800 metres above sea level, Tiwanaku is 
one of South America’s most spectacular 
archaeological sites. A pre-Columbian 
city in the southern Andes, it was for 
centuries the capital of a vast and 
powerful empire that owed its supremacy 
to the use of innovative materials and 
techniques to improve agricultural 
production, thus increasing its economic 
power. It was from Tiwanaku that the 
eponymous culture spread, reaching 
its peak between 500 AD and 900 AD. 
From there, its influence radiated over 
a vast territory that included western 
Bolivia, southwestern Peru and northern 
Argentina and Chile.
The secrets of 
Tiwanaku,
revealed by a drone
Lucía Iglesias Kuntz (UNESCO)
Tiwanaku, the spiritual and 
political centre of Bolivia’s 
Tiwanaku culture, is seventy 
kilometres west of La Paz 
and fifteen kilometres from 
the shores of Lake Titicaca. 
Inscribed on UNESCO’s World 
Heritage List since 2000, the 
place still holds many secrets 
today. A UNESCO project reveals 
some extraordinary discoveries.
The publication of this article 
coincides with the 42nd session 
of the World Heritage Committee, 
held from 24 June to 4 July 2018, 
in Manama, Bahrain.

area.

Unfortunately, Tiwanaku was brutally 
plundered, following the collapse of 
its culture in the thirteenth century. 
The place attracted hunters of buried 
treasure like a magnet, and much of its 
valuable heritage disappeared. Numerous 
historical documents also show that 
the site became a quarry, from which 
to extract materials to build modern 
buildings – the evidence of which is still 
visible in the town centre nearby, and 
even in La Paz, the Bolivian capital.

These remnants, nevertheless, exhibit 
the unmistakable hallmark of great 
civilizations, with marvels such as the 
Puma Punku (Doorway of the Puma), 
made of solid blocks of sandstone, 
weighing upto 130 tons, assembled with 
copper staples. This was an astonishing 
feat for a civilization that lacked the 
concept of the wheel – some experts 
estimate that between 1,300 and 
2,600 people would have been needed to 
lift the stones. The knowledge of the use 
of metal demonstrates the civilization’s 
military superiority.
New discoveries
The need to provide the site with 
an updated management plan – a 
requirement for all sites inscribed on 
the World Heritage List – as well as an 
educational programme and museums 
to help solve some of Tiwanaku's 
riddles, constitutes the raison d'être of 
the Preservation and Conservation of 
Tiwanaku and the Akapana Pyramid 
project. Launched in 2015 by the UNESCO 
Office in Quito, the $870,000 project is 
funded by Japanese Funds-in-Trust for 
World Heritage.
This ambitious undertaking, which has just 
been completed, also included a plan for 
sustainable tourism − since Tiwanaku is 
located on the Altiplano, a seismic zone in 
a valley set between two mountain ranges 
− and finally, at the request of the World 
Heritage Committee, the completion of a 
topographic survey of the entire site.
“I was already working in the field, so I 
proposed to UNESCO that this topography 
study be done using remote sensing, 
because now, with drones and satellites, 
topographic results with very high 
precision can be obtained,” explains 
archaeologist José Ignacio Gallego Revilla, 
who worked on the project on behalf 
of the Organization. “It took us a year to 
set it up. Since I was collaborating with 
the Complutense University of Madrid, 
I thought of going to its Campus of 
Excellence − which is actually a group of 
laboratories formed by various faculties, 
with excellent professionals and very 
competitive prices. But we needed a drone 
that could fly at more than 4,000 metres 
and, as we couldn’t transport the one 
available at the university in Madrid to 
Bolivia, we approached a Swiss company 
that sells its aircraft in Chile and Bolivia. That 
company picked up the images which we 
then analysed in Madrid, in the laboratory.”

For me, it’s 
the discovery 
of a lifetime: 
Tiwanaku has 
been one of 
the historical 
references 
of world 
archaeology 
for 500 years

The imaging was done between 
October and December 2016 and the 
first results were obtained in May 2017. 
The drone provided a highly accurate 
topography of the entire archaeological 
site, with a margin of error of less than 
four centimetres.
The resulting map revealed the presence 
of a set of hitherto unknown structures 
that extend over the entire explored area 
of more than 411 hectares. In total, the 
heritage area covers over 600 hectares − 
six times larger than previously estimated.
After the analysis, the images taken by 
the drone made it possible to identify the 
traces of a stone temple buried next to a 
hundred or more circular and rectangular 
structures of vast dimensions, which were 
possibly domestic units, as well as ditches, 
canals, roads and other constructions in 
different sectors. But the new data also 
redefined known monuments, such as 
Puma Punku, a temple complex of which 
only two hectares had been explored, 
and which we now know has two more 
platforms that are buried. “The drone has 
revealed that this a religious complex 
covering seventeen hectares, which 
is three times the size of the Great 
Pyramid of Giza in Egypt,” explains 
the archaeologist.
“Suddenly we had a map of the site and 
of everything that is still buried there,” 
Gallego Revilla added. “For me, it’s the 
discovery of a lifetime: Tiwanaku has been 
one of the historical references of world 
archaeology for 500 years. As a researcher, 
things like this happen only once in your 
entire career,” he enthuses, displaying the 
maps and images that support his claim, 
on his computer.
Involving communities
Julio Condori, director of the 
Archaeological, Anthropological and 
Administrative Research Centre of 
Tiwanaku (CIAAAT), the site’s managing 
body, has been involved in the 
project since its beginning. For him, 
the new topographic map is in itself 
a conservation tool. “We now have 
650 hectares under study,” he notes. “This 
marks a milestone for further research 
and an expansion of the area under high-
level protection.”
Another strong point of the project is 
that the indigenous communities that 
inhabit the site, on its northern and 
eastern sides, were consulted at all times. 
The municipality of Tiwanaku currently 
includes three towns with twenty-three 
communities, and some 12,000 people, 
who live in the archaeological zone itself, 
and its immediate surroundings. “At 
each stage of the project, we had a very 
dynamic interaction with the inhabitants. 
I would say that this is precisely the key 
that allowed us to reach this result,” adds 
Condori. “Members of the Huancollo 
and Achaca communities participated 
last year in the surveys we conducted to 
verify if the reality corresponded to data 
provided by the drone, and they did so 
with great pleasure. We have to continue 
communicating our results so that they 
can take ownership of them.” At the 
same time, the number of national and 
international visitors – more than 125,000 
in 2017 – continues to increase. “With 
that income, the site is economically 
self-sufficient, and it gives us the means 
to work with architects, chemists, 
geologists, etc.,” says Condori. “We hope 
to continue working with the municipal 
and national authorities, and of course, 
with UNESCO’s support.”
According to an Aymara legend, 
the ancestors concealed the most 
emblematic monument of Tiwanaku in 
the Puerta del Sol, the Gate of the Sun. It 
was an important secret that would save 
humanity when it reached the brink of 
the abyss. Fortunately, that moment does 
not seem to have arrived yet. Instead, 
what is certain is that all the good work 
and the flight of a drone has opened 
up a new era for the culture, that from 
the shores of the sacred Lake Titicaca, 
established the most advanced society 
of its time and managed to create a new 
kind of state hitherto unknown in this 
corner of the American continent.

The UNESCO Courier is 70!
The only journal Nelson Mandela 
read on Robben Island
Nelson Mandela, President of the African 
National Congress and Federico Mayor, 
Director-General of UNESCO 
(1987-1999), at the Organization’s 
Headquarters on 14 October 1993. 
But prisoners could apply to study for 
high school and university courses and 
thus order publications necessary for 
their studies. And so, together with books 
on subjects such as accounting and 
economics, the prison administration also 
allowed in the UNESCO Courier magazine, 
which, for some time, arrived regularly 
from Paris.
The prison authorities, who were mostly, 
if not exclusively, Afrikaans-speaking, 
clearly considered the magazine to 
be harmless reading material for this 
class of prisoners. After spending the 
day smashing stones in the limestone 
quarry, they could retire to their cells 
in the evening and read the Courier’s 
"insignificant" contents.
Nelson Mandela and his fellow political 
prisoners were condemned to life 
imprisonment in 1964. Their first years in 
jail were as intellectually and spiritually 
barren as the terrain of Robben Island 
itself – the prison authorities made sure of 
that. Newspapers, even local ones, were 
not allowed. "The authorities attempted 
to impose a complete blackout, they did 
not want us to learn anything that might 
raise our morale or reassure us that people 
on the outside were still thinking about 
us," Mandela writes in his autobiography, 
Long Walk to Freedom (1994).
Annar Cassam
“Apartheid represents today the 
vilest form of modern slavery. 
UNESCO's patient but tenacious 
and vigorous action ties in 
with the struggle of the South 
African blacks themselves, 
who have shown that with the 
courage of revolt they have 
discarded fear and regained 
hope. If the international 
community is to remain true to 
itself, it must mobilize and act 
firmly in order not to disappoint 
that hope.” This is what Prisoner 
number 466/64 of Robben 
Island, Nelson Mandela, read 
in the Courier, under the very 
noses of the watchful agents 
of the police state that was 
apartheid South Africa.
With this article, the Courier marks 
the 100th birth anniversary of 
Nelson Mandela, who was born 
on 18 July 1918.

The UNESCO Courier is 70!70

It was President Mandela himself who 
recounted this in September 1996 to 
the then Director-General of UNESCO, 
Federico Mayor, in Union Buildings, 
the President’s Office in Pretoria, 
during Mayor’s official visit to the new 
democratic South Africa.
The President explained how pleased 
he and his companions had been to 
read the Courier, through which they 
had learnt about so many subjects they 
had never encountered before – such 
as cultural diversity and mankind’s 
common heritage, African history, 
education for development, and so 
on. These subjects did not exist in 
the apartheid lexicon, let alone in the 
solitary confines of Robben Island. 
Reading the Courier was a way of 
learning about what was happening in 
the real world outside. Nelson Mandela 
was keen that UNESCO’s Director-
General was informed of this. 
I had the privilege of accompanying 
Frederico Mayor on that visit. As 
I listened to the President’s words, my 
mind tried to take in their meaning 
and significance. The Courier, so aptly 
named, was the carrier-pigeon that 
flew regularly from Paris to a remote 
spot in the middle of nowhere in the 
southern Atlantic Ocean – bringing news 
and ideas from the five continents to 
Mandela and his colleagues, under the 
very noses of the watchful agents of the 
police state that was apartheid South 
Africa. Knowledge and ideas grow wings 
when necessary.
Apartheid: no escape
Robben Island was the South African 
Alcatraz, an island penitentiary from 
which there was no escape for the black 
common-law convicts who were sent 
there for life. In the 1960s and ‘70s, as the 
struggle against apartheid strengthened 
and spread, the island became the place 
where the racist government sent its 
most serious political opponents –also 
for life. In reality, the island was a prison 
within-a-prison, for the principal jail was 
mainland South Africa itself. Here, the 
white minority settler community was 
locked inside its paranoia about its own 
racial superiority over the indigenous 
population. Every aspect of existence, 
both private and public, was governed 
by racist laws designed to oppress and 
denigrate the black majority for the 
benefit of the white minority population, 
which was privileged in every way.
In so doing, the ruling class claimed 
to be preserving and promoting 
"European values", in keeping with 
their self-styled "civilizing mission" 
in Africa. Ironically, they themselves 
were complete strangers to those 
values – for they had no understanding 
of concepts such as liberty, equality, 
democracy, fraternity, values for which 
the Europeans themselves had fought, 
across the centuries.
Indeed, UNESCO and the entire United 
Nations system were born out of just 
such a struggle – a decimating war 
against Nazi racism which had brought 
the world to the edge of the abyss in the 
Second World War. In 1945, the lesson 
was learnt that "never again" would the 
nations of the world allow such horrors 
to happen. At UNESCO, these countries 
decided deliberately to “build the 
defences of peace in the minds of men” 
(see UNESCO’s Constitution), by sharing 
and expanding human knowledge in all 
its aspects, especially through the areas of 
education, science and culture.
The apartheid regime, however, learnt 
a different lesson and chose to go the 
opposite way – to promote separation, 
exclusion, deprivation, humiliation 
and violence. For those citizens who 
dared to question and challenge this 
backward ideology, the punishment was 
banishment for life.

Reading about racism 
on Robben Island
I see Mandela and his fellow freedom 
fighters smiling with satisfaction when 
reading the article on racism written 
by John Rex, British sociologist and 
educationist, in 1968: “The most striking 
instance of racism in the world today is 
that of the system of Apartheid in South 
Africa. Apartheid is not as some people 
may still imagine a serious attempt to 
provide equal though separate facilities 
for all races. It is segregation carried 
through by men with white skins to their 
own advantage and to the disadvantage 
of the black and coloured populations.” 
(The ubiquitous shadow of racism).
Less than ten years later, the massacre 
of schoolchildren by heavily-armed 
police during the Soweto uprising in 
1976 was a watershed in the history of 
the struggle. It brought to the streets an 
angry younger generation of fighters 
against apartheid, revolted by the 
imposition of Afrikaans as the language 
of instruction in black schools.
It also made it obvious to the outside 
world that the racist government had no 
strategy except the use of brute force, 
even against unarmed school children. 
By this time, South Africa had become an 
international pariah state, shunned by 
almost all the people of the world, if not 
by all governments.
In November the following year, the 
Courier published a special edition on 
racism in South Africa, Southern Africa 
at grips with racism, which started with 
these words: “Apartheid represents 
today the vilest form of modern slavery. 
UNESCO's patient but tenacious and 
vigorous action ties in with the struggle 
of the South African blacks themselves, 
who have shown that with the courage 
of revolt they have discarded fear and 
regained hope. If the international 
community is to remain true to itself, it 
must mobilize and act firmly in order not 
to disappoint that hope.”
This issue was unlikely to have been 
allowed on Robben Island, but by then 
the struggle had reached the world stage 
and it was beginning to dawn on some of 
the leaders in Pretoria that they would be 
needing Mandela – sooner or later.

As the years went by, Mandela and his 
cause grew in strength and stature, while 
the apartheid regime continued on its 
path of destruction and violence against 
its own black population and against 
neighbouring African states.
Mandela’s long period on the island 
came to an end in 1982, when he 
was brought back to the mainland to 
Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, and 
then finally to house arrest and to the 
relative "comfort" of a cottage in the 
Victor Verster prison outside the city. 
During this phase in captivity, which 
lasted until 1990, Mandela spent hours 
"talking to the enemy", as he puts it, 
by initiating dialogue and discussion 
with the more intelligent, less bigoted 
members of the regime, in order to make 
them understand that state violence and 
military action would not resolve the 
growing unrest in the country, and that 
the pressure for change – coming from 
all sides, including from the international 
community – would have to be dealt 
with politically.
Finally, the day which had to come, 
came. On 11 February 1990, Mandela 
walked out of the prison gates, and 
within days, established himself as 
the moral leader of the country. A 
remarkable achievement for a man 
who was not only banished for nearly 
three decades, but whose name, 
photograph and words it was a crime to 
publish! In May 1994, after four years of 
gruelling negotiations with the De Klerk 
government, Mandela was elected the 
political leader of the new South Africa, 
the first president of a democratic, non-
racist society where the ex-oppressors 
live in peace with the majority whom 
they humiliated for centuries.
Mandela’s 
"10,000 days"
The twenty-seven years that Mandela 
spent in prison can been seen in two 
ways – as a terrible sacrifice of the best 
years of a man’s life, and a cruel price 
in absence and loss exacted from his 
family. This punishment is undeniable 
and immeasurable. But Mandela’s 
"10,000 days" behind bars, to use his 
own expression, can also be viewed on 
another timescale – this is how long it 
took for him to convince the racists to free 
themselves of their own ideological and 
cultural chains, to accept that freedom 
and dignity for all South Africans, 
whatever their colour or creed, were the 
ultimate qualifications of a civilized state.
The "white tribesmen" of Africa are 
lucky that Mandela waited those long 
years, that he was there to the bitter 
end in order to lead them, peacefully 
and patiently, out of the prison gates of 
their own minds – out of the delusion of 
separateness and superiority, to a land 
to which they can all belong and from 
which none can be expelled because of 
the colour of his skin. 
Robben Island became the first South 
African national site to join the World 
Heritage List in 1999. If ever there comes 
into existence a world heritage list to 
name those who have expanded and 
uplifted the collective conscience of 
mankind, Nelson Mandela will have 
pride of place on it.
