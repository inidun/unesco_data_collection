2 UNESCO COURIER May 1949
Geography
For Wortd
Understanding
THE teaching of geographyas a means of develop-
ing international understand-
ing will be one of the main
subjects for discussion at the
12th International Conference
on Public Education, organiz-
ed jointly by Unesco and the
International Bureau of Edu-
cation (I. B. E.), opening in Ge-
neva, Switzerland, on July 4.
From these discussions it is
hoped to show how geography
teaching can play its part in
education for world under-
standing by helping to break
down the spirit of isolationism
and to remove false ideas
about other peoples and cul-
tures.
As part of its educational
programme for 1949 and 1950,
Unesco is preparing a pam-
phlet of suggestions on how
geography teaching can be
used to develop this one-
world outlook in children, and
in 1950 a Unesco Seminar will
be devoted to geography
teaching.
Unesco and the I. B. E. felt
that the Geneva Conference
would provide an excellent
opportunity for a preliminary
exchange of views on this
subject. After the Conference,
the Unesco pamphlet will be
completed in the light of the
comments made, and distri-
buted to the participants in
the 1950 Seminar.
Another subject for discus-
sion at the Conference is how
primary school children are
being taught natural science.
This will be bald on the
results of an inquiry covering
47 countries, recently carried
out by the I. B. R.
Information from a similar
I. B. E. inquiry into the teaching
of reading will also be studied,
so as to bring into perspective
its present status as a school
activity.
The Conference will recom-
mend ways of Improving pre-
sent-day reading lesson tech-
nique for children and for
illiterate adults.
Reports on national educa-
tional developments during
1948 will be made to the Con-
ference and will later be
published in the 1949 Inter-
national Yearbook of Educa-
tion.
Torres Bodet Reaffirms Streamlined
ITTLE more than forty-
eight hours after his talk
WiLh Presid nt Truman in
Washington, which terminated
his successful visit to the United
States last month. Dr. Tor-
res Bodet, Director-General of
Unesco, stepped off a trans-
Atlantic'plane in London for a
three-day stay in Great Britain.
Between the late afternoon of
Friday, April 8, and Tuesday,
April 12 when he boarded an-
other'plane to take him back to
Paris, Dr. Torres Bodet conferred
with the Prime Minister, Mr.
Attlee, and with educational lead-
ers in Oxford and Cambridge,
and addressed the first 1949 meet-
ing of the United Kingdom Na-
tional Commission.
On April 11, addressing 300 de-
legates to the meeting of the
National Commission, Dr. Torres
Bodet recalled the days of the
founding of Unesco in 1945.
Unesco, he said."has r. 0t yet
become the powerful organiza-
tion of whose world-wide influ-
ence some of us dreamed... How-
ever, the essential thing is that
the structure of Unesco does
exist."
He paid tribute to the Unesco's
first Director-General, Dr. Julian
Huxley and declared that the
Organization"is equally grateful
both for the counsels and for
the criticisms"it has received
from Great Britain in what
he termed Unesco's"apprentice
years".
Intense Intellectual
Ambition
GGIT would be a bad sign ifwe expected nothing but
praise", he continued,"when we
yourselves are far from being
satisfied with our work. We have
undertaken a tremendous pro-
gramme. And our resources for
carrying it out are so slender..
If there is a fault to be found
with Unesco. it is, after all, a
very creditable fault : that of an
intense intellectual ambition."
Dr. Torres Bodet went on to
say that it had first been neces-
sary to map out the domain
which, sooner or later, should be
Unesco's field of action. Hence
the vastness of the programme
drawn up at the Mexico City
Conference and confirmed, in its
main lines, by the Beirut Confer-
ence.
"Our task now", he said,"is
not to retreat from the ambi-
tious scale of the original pro-
gramme but modestly to single
out from the wide field of pro-
jects the ones which seem to us
to be of the greatest importance

to culture, without for one mo-
ment losing sight of realities."
A TASK such as that entrustedto Unesco did not yield its
fruits in a short time. Not a few
centuries were needed to allow
even the idea of intellectual co-
operation to prevail, in the minds
of the elite, over the lust of spiri-
tual domination. Where nations
had needed centuries, how could
one expect an inter-government-
al institution to achieve, in the
space of months, decisive and
numerous successes.
"Therefore", Dr. Torres Bodet
went ün,"in the work of deter-
mining which part of our pro-
gramme was to be carried out
within a particular time, we
were guided by one overriding
consideration : our prudence was
not to imply any renunciation,
res Bodet,"people ask me, why
is Unesco not in touch with this
or that group of intellectual lead-
ers, thinkers, artists and poets ?
Does its governmental status
blind it to the importance of the
private associations ? You have
told us yourself that the object-
ive of Unesco is the good of man,
Why, then. is there such a gulf
between the average man and
your Organization ?
"I am bound to admit that
questions like that disturb me
profoundly. I feel that there is
still an enormous gap between
the activities of Unesco and the
needs, hopes and fears of that
average man, that man in the
street, of whose destiny we who
work in Unesco must always be
thinking. On the other hand, I
ask in my turn : is it not for the
300 delegates to the U. K. National Commission heard Dr. Torres Bodet
in London last month state :"Help Us to make sure Unesco does not
become stiff in the joints..."Above, members of U. K. delegation.
and we were to give no one-
least of all ourselves-the impres-
sion that questions deferred were
questions abandoned. By this I
mean that our criterion in mak-
ing a choice will not be ease of
execution. And between a spec-
tacular project with no future
and a imple, unimposing project
likely to have useful results. we
shall not hesitate. We shall
choose the second.
"Following this line of action.
my first care as Director-General
of Unesco was to submit to the
Executive Board a list of prior-
ities, which the Board approved.
Three Considerations
GGIT would indeed be a mistaketo abandon the vastness of
our programme ; but it would
have been an even greater mis-
take not to realize that the best
programmes are those that can
be carried out. The peoples
expect from our Organization
more than a string of promises,
however fine. In deciding on the
priorities... we took into account...
three cons : derations : first, which
projects are likely to be of the
greatest and most far-reaching
benefit to the great masses ? Sec-
ond, which project can best help
the'leaders'in their task of
serving the masses ? And, finally,
which projects have already
reached such a stage in Unesco's
work that to interrupt them
would be tantamount to a costly
failure and would be thought an
incomprehensible lack of admin-
istrative continuity ?"
'Wherever I go", said Dr. Tor-
National Commissions in each
country to help us fill that im-
menSe gap ?
Reserves and the Vanguard
GGEACH time that I addressan institution like yours",
said Dr. Torres Bodet,"I put to
its members the same request :
Help us to make sure that
Unesco does not become stiff in
the joints before it has grown up.
In the battle we have to wage
against ignorance and incompre-
hension, you must be our reser-
ves and yet, in a sense, you must
be our vanguard, too...
"You have done much for
Unesco. And Unesco expects
much of you, particularly if we
consider the obstacles that stand
in our way.
"They are of all kinds. First,
political obstacles. Unesco wants.
of course, to be above politics.
But politics are indisputably
there, with their conflicting
interests and passion ; and
through them Unesco is often
reduced to playing the part of a
silent witness. Then, material
obstacles. Whilst culture requ : res
increasing numbers of ex-
changes and efficient communi-
cations, economic problems are
erecting barriers between States,
allowing books to get no further
than the frontiers, stopping
travel for research workers and
holding up the transport of
research equipment, and fixing
quotas for ideas as well as for
goods. Lastly, moral obstacles.
These are the most serious, for
they now arouse neither aston-
ishment nor indignation. The
people have suffered too long
from spoken and written lies.
How can one now ask them to be
suddenly enthusiastic over ideas
according to which they must
redouble their efforts to bring
about, at some distant date. a
state of reasonable and just secu-
rity ?
"If these new demands are to
be made upon them", said
Dr. Torres Bodet."Unesco must
prove that it is not an abstrac-
tion, a platform for speeches, an
international trade mark for
mass-produced projects.
"But is Unesco alone to pro-
vide that proof ?" he asked.
Unesco knew that, by itself, it
could neither produce nor con-
sume anything. Everything that
it gave it had first to receive.
Its activity would be absurd if
it were ever unfortunate enough
to be cut off from its living
springs, that is, from the various
spiritual resources of its Member
States contributing to the pro-
motion of friendship between
nations and sympathy between
cultures."You, gentlemen", he
went on."are yourselves part of
Unesco. Without you and without
the Universities, writers, profes-
sors and scientists of the forty-
six countries now taking part in
its work. there would be no rea-
son for Unesco. and Unesco
would not exist."
INDIA'S SHARE
OF BOOK COUPONS
The Indian Ministry of Educa-
tion, which has received 15, 000
dollars worth of Unesco Book
Coupons, has allocated 10, 000 dollars
to universities, (, 000 dollars to
scientific institutions and 1, 04H
dollars to private individuals.
It has been estimated that book
coupons to the value of between
100, 000 and 200, 000 dollars wound
be needed to cover India's most
urgent needs for foreign literature.
Eo far, for all countries, Unesco
has been able to issue, on sale,
book coupons totalling 100, 000
dollars and approximately 44, 890
dollars as free gifts from its Emer-
gency Reconstruction Fund for 1941.

May 1949 UNESCO COURIER s
VER 2, 000 teachers and professorsf from schools and universities in
England and Wales gave a great
welcome to Lf. Jaime Torres Bodet,
Director-General of Unesco, when he
addressed the annual conference of the
National Union of Teachers at Margate
on April 18th.
Delegates from seven other countries,
including the United States, the Soviet
Union and Poland, joined in the applause
when Dr. Torres Bodet was introduced as
"The first world citizer. kom the teacher s
point of view".
Speaking in English, Dr. Torres Bodet
said that his presence at the Conference
represented a unique synthesis of Unesco's
history and its aims ;. its history, because
Unesco was born in Britain, at a Con-
ference in London in the autumn of 1945 ;
its a ; 111S, because thev as teachers held
the key to Unesco's fundamental objective
- that through education the peoples
should come to understand each otheor and
be enabled to build for themselves a
better and a peaceful world.
Our Hope for Future Peace
GGIF there is anv profession which, by itsvery nature, carries an obligation to
implant Unesco's ideals in the minds of
the young, it is the teaching profession",
he stated.
"In education", he continued,"lies our
hope for future peace and progress."This
was recognized by the General Assembly
of the United Nations in Article 26 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
adopted last December. The Art'cle
declares :'Everyone has the right to edu-
cation'-without distinction of any kind.
"In some countries such a statement
appears self evident. But it is a Right
that is far from being realized. In fact,
today, more than half of mankind is
illiterate. There arre many countries where
the proportion of illiterates is over 60 %
and in Africa and Asia the figure is
often as high as 90 %.
"Article 26 continues :'Education shall
be free, at least in so far as elementary
and fundamental education are concerned.
Elementary education shall be compul-
ttory'.
A'Backward'World
"FOR you, in this country, these condi-- *-tions will appear as self-evident as
the Right to Education itself. They have
been achieved in Britain, and achieved
in a large part as a. result of the efforts
of your own profession and of your own
Un. on. You could not admit that the
'Teachers Hold [ (ey To Unesco
Aims' Di, 4ectol.-Gelleral States
benefits of education should not be en-
joyed by all the childrea of Britain.
"As citizens of the world we cannot-
you cannot-admit that half of its child-
ren should cor. : inue to have no books, no
schools, no teachers-no education, be-
cause they happen to have been born in
so-called'backward'countries.
"So long as these conditions exist we
are all citizens of a backwa. : d world.
"But it will not be enough to achieve
elementary education for all, momentous
as that would be. As ycu well know,
society has not discharged its duties
towards the children when it has taught
them reading, writing and arithmetic.
These children who must build the future
- a better and more peaceful world than
our own-can only do, so if they are
enabled to develop their gifts and abilities
to the full.
"The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights puts it this way :'Everyone has
the right freely to participate ; n the cul-
tural life of the community, to enjoy the
arts and to share in scientific advance-
ment and its benefit'..,
-...'-,.,-.
History and Nationalism
"NONE of us dare acquiesce in the.1 injustice-indeed, the danger-of
reserving culture for the few, while dis-
tributing sparingly to the majority the
rudiments of a purely utilitarian training.
"But our objective goes even beyond
that. We must give all children the op-
portunity of becoming truly educated men
and women. We must also help them to
become good citizens, not only of their
own country but of the world. To that
end, it is essential that they should be
taught history in a way that will help
them to guard against prejudice and
narrow conceptions of nationalism. Too
often the schools to-day fail to offer the
child the opportunity to learn the history
of'peoples othoc than their own. Too
many children leave school totally ignor-
ant of the ways in which civilization has
been fashioned, and is still being fashion-
ed, by the achievements of many peoples
and many cultures.
"How can the child who is brought up

on the stories of his own national heroes
only and their achievement, fail to fail
prey, as an adult, to such mischievous
ideas as the'hereditary foe', the'foreign-
er', the'inferior race' ?
"It is clear that even with the best of
schools and the best of teachers, education
for citizenship must be reinforced by the
example of the family, the city and the
country. Ethics could not be taught by
slogans or aphorisrns : they must be
buttressed by the lessons of life.
'The Future Cannot Be Evaded'
ZIT may be said", he continued,"that- *-we have not chosen the best time for
the tasks we have she, ourselves. We live
in a world of moral and political tensions,
threatened by a dangerous recrudescence
of aggressive or defensive nationalisms.
Yet no man chooses his fate ; as a great
South American educator put it, the fu-
ture cannot be evaded."
Dr. Torres Bodet said that the tensions
of our times aggravated the task and
increased our responsibility. He did not
suggest that teachers alone could carry
on their shoulders the entire moral burden
of the time, although some people would
like them to do so, thinking no doubt that
they would then be relieved of any fur-
ther responsibility themselves.
"Unesco", he added,"is in somewhat the
same position."
While there were those who argued that
the political issues of our times were such
as to render Unesco an amiable but futile
adjunct to the United Nations, there were
also those who felt that in bringing the
Organization into being they discharged
their full responsibility.
Since the Organization was created
three years ago, 46 countries had joined
and had given it for this year a bUdget of
less than two million pounds. These were
the funds of which Unesco itself disposed
in the war against ignorance. If these
were its sole resources, if the staff at
Unesco House, were the only soldiers in
its army, then indeed the battle would be
hopeless."
Four Zones of Germany To Profit
,. :',..'.."..-.'... ;
From Unesco-Created Book Centre
Book Exchange Centre in Germany,
A'-which will enable libraries in the
four occupation zones to inter-
change publications with countries all
over the world, was officially established
on May 1, on the initiative of Unesco.
Arrangements for the creation of a sim-
ilar centre in Japan were also complet-
ed last month in Tokyo.
Located in Bad Godesberg, in the West-
ern zone, the newly-created German Book
Exchange Centre (Tauschstelle), will be
financed by the Notgemeinschaft der
deutschen WissenBchaft (Emergency Coun-
cil for the Promotion of German Science)
and a possible grant-in-aid from the
Rockefeller Foundation
Plans to create the German Centre
were drawn up at a meeting convened by
Unesco at Bad Godesberg on April 12,
which was attended by librarians from
almost every university library in Western
Germany, In addition, a representative
from a Book E'I (change Centre in Gte
Russian sector of Berlin also attended
the meeting and agreed to assure close
co-operation between the new Tausch-
stelle and the Berlin Exchange Centre.
Thus, between them, the two Centres
will cover the four zones of Germany.
The Bad Godesberg Centre will work
directly with Uneco in arranging the ex-
change of publications between Germany
and Unesco Member States. In particular,
it will supply information on German
institutions seeking publication exchanges
in any given subject and will dispose of
complete lists of German publications for
exchange.
Unesco will shortly distribute the first
lists of such German institutions to the
appropriate agencies in other countries.
In many instances, the newly-establish-
ed Tauschstelle can already furnish rel-
evant information on exchanges. En-
quiries concerning such exchanges with
Germany should be addressed to :

IN Japan, the National Diet Library inTokyo has been designated to act a. s
cho-ordination centre for publication ! ex-
change, and has already supplied Unesco
with lists of learned societies, scientific
institutions, universities, public libraries,
agricultural experimental stations and of
Unesco clubs in Japan, all of which desire
to enter into international exchange
agreements.
These lists which comprise nearly 800
institutions, will be circulated by Unesco
in all parts of the world, and will be
followed by lists of Japanese publications
available for exchange.
Those interested in establishing ex-
change arrangements with Japan, or wish-
ing to obtain bibhographical information
frem that country, are advised to com-
mrmicate with the National Diet Library
(attention of Mr. T. Kanamori, Chief
Librarian), Akasaka, Tokyo.
The two new Centres have been creat-
ed as an important part of Unesco's edu-
cational, scientific and cultural pro-
gramme for Germany and Japan and
bring to 5 the number of National Ex-
change Centres create in direct response
to Unesco efforts. The other 3 are locat-
ed in Canada, the United Kingdom and
the United States.
A Treasure of Richness
DR. TORRES BODET continued :"Butwe are backed by a treasure of m-
comparabl richness-the accumulated,
tested and ever-growing treasury of
knowledge and experience given to us by
the poets and philosophers and sic : dentists
of all the ages.
"We have our arm : es too. There are the
countless heroes of the past-well-known
and nameless-who fought before us to
win the rights and the benefits we now
enjoy. Our soldiers, today, are the men
and women of goodwill everywhere ; and
in the front ranks are the millions of
teachers.

'Seminário Brasileiro'
lew Literacy Drives
Launched in Americas
A p r i n t e d page is still thedeepest IWSsible mystery to more
than half the people of the world.
Today literacy campaigns are
cutting down this figure.
Within the past twenty-five years,
no less than two hundred and
fifty million adults have been
taught to read and write, but it is
estimated that there are still one
thousand two hundred million
illiterates in the world today. Most
of them live in Asia, Africa and
Latin America, where recent
efforts of national governments
and international organizations
have begun to show encouraging
results.
Extensive campaigns against
illiteracy are being waged in
Brazil, Haiti, Mexico and other
Latin American countries. In
India, the Bombay City Adult
Education Committee alone has
taught one hundred and forty
thousand adults to read and write
in nine years. Rumania hall
planned to wipe out illiteracy by
1951 and Italy has hired an extra
ten thousand teachers for the same
purpose. The struggle against
illiteracy is world-wide.
In order to make the best possible
teaching methods availab ! e to all
countries, Unesco and the Pan Amer-
ican-Union are sponsoring a six-
week seminar for Latin-American
educators in Brazil scheduled to
open on July 27. A similar session
for the Far East is to take place
at Delhi, India later this year.
THE Brazilian Government hasallocated the sum of S50. 000
for the Seminar which about 120
delegates from at least 25 coun-
tries are expected to attend. The
city of Niteroi, Capital of the State
of Rio de Janeiro, has been selected
as the site of the meeting and all
delegates and Unesco Secretariat
members will be the guests of the
Brazilian Government.
The Seminar will examine the
causes of illiteracy in the Americas,
the objectives and preparation of
literacy campaigns, methods and
materials best suited for teaching
illiterates, and how to follow up
the results of such campaigns and
integrate them with Adult Educa--
tion and other programmes.

Paris Educators'Conference
Stresses World Point of View
modern type of school, dedicated
A'-tao the teaching of world under-
standing, has been growing in in-
fluence in widely separated parts of the
world during recent years. These"inter-
national schools", such as the Interna-
tional School of Geneva, with students
and teachers from many lands, have been
educating boys and girls for citizenship
not only of their own country but of the
world community.
Last month, the principals of 14 of
these schools in eight countries met at
Unesco House to talk over their exper-
iences and work out plans for closer co-
operation in the future. The conference
was the first of its kind ever to be con-
vened.
Among the subjects discussed were ways
of training teachers for work in interna-
tional schools, practical means of stu-
dent and teacher exchange, and a plan
submitted by one of the delegates,
for the creation of a group of schools
situated in different countries, but united
as one world-wide institution.
Teachers'Training Course
THE greatest difficulty facing"pioneer"- schools which stress international
education in their curricula, the con-
ference agreed, was to recruit teachers
with a real international spirit. To meet
this lack of trained teachers, the con-
ference decided to organize a 6 to 8
weeks'course, in the summer of 1950,
which will provide teachers and pro-
spective teachers with an introduction to
international schools and seek to develop
the international outlook in the teachers.
The schools represented at the con-
ference also agreed to provide a"follow-
up"period of practical experience for as
many as possible Of those who attend
the study course. These teachers will be
attached to existing schools as observers
and may also be called on to assist in
the work...
International Diploma :.' .
THE school directors agreed to experi-ment with the award of an inter-
national diploma to their pupils in 1950,
the minimum requirement for which
would be a satisfactory knowledge of a
second language and the completion of
a thesis on a subiect of international
interest. This would serve as one means
of encouraging an international outlook.
After discussing the possibilities of
instituting an international diploma
which would be valid for college or univ-
ersity entrance in any country, the con-
ference felt that the practical difficulties
involved in such an award were too great
for it to be envisaged at the present time.
Schools Around the Globe
ACCORDING to a plan, submitted byone of the delegates, the new
world educational institution would be
based on the ideas and the interna-
tional outlook of the Werkplaats Inter-
national Children's Community at Bilt-
hoven, Holland, Mr. Kees Boeke, prin-
cipal of the Bilthoven school, explain-
ed the two salient features of the school :
teaching was along modern lines follow-
ing, as far as possible, the interest and
needs of the children themselves, and
decisions were taken only with the un-
animous approval of teachers and pupils.
He pointed out that the entire"chain"
of proposed new schools would work
along the same lines so that students
could easily move from one country to'the other without any loss of time in
their studies.
Learning Ways of Other Peoples
THUS an American boy, for example,could study for a time in Holland or
in England in an English speaking school.
During that time he would study French
to prepare himself for a year or
two in a French speaking school in
Belgium, France or Switzerland. There
he would continue his studies in the
various subjects and in the meantime,
perhaps, concentrate on Spanish to en-
able him to finish his secondary school
training in South America.
All the time he would be in touch with
boys and girls of different nationalities,
would make friends with them and
deepen his understanding and apprecia-
tion of the ways and customs of differ-
ent peoples of the world.
The conference recommended that the
methods suggested by Mr. Boeke be
studied at a future meeting to be held
at the Bilthoven school itself.
From the reports submitted by each
of the school directors and educators,
much valuable information was exchang-
ed and the participants unanimously re-
quested Unesco to call a similar meeting
every year.
Summer Camp
For War Orphans.
To Open
France
AN International Camp of War Or-phans will be organized this summer
by the International Federation of Child-
ren's Communities. The Federation, set
up with the aid of Unesco, has chosen
the MouIin-Vieux"RepuNie", a children's
community near Grenoble, in France, as
the camp site.
With the aid of Unesco, governmental
organizations and private individuals, the
Federation is planni : 1g in August to group
about 50 war orphans, aged 12 to 15,
from children's communities in 17 coun-
tries.
Situated in a beautiful Alpine valley,
the camp will give the children valuable
experience in international living, as well
as benefitting their physical health and
education.
The programme will include physical
culture, excursions in the region, and
study of the folklore of various nations.
The camp project, which was thought
out by the children of Moulin-Vieux, will
cost about 2, 500, 000 French francs and
the Federation is therefore appealing
for help to make it a success.
Cash contributions may be sent to

lr HE town affiliation idea attracted international
attention early this month when war-devastated
Orléans, one of France's oldest ities, joined hands
with Wichita. Kansas, modern aircraft and farming
centre, in a programme of international friendship which
the Kansas State Commission for Unesco is encouraging
between Kansas communities and those of other countries.
The project was formally launched on May 7-8, when
Orleans and Wichita simultaneously celebrated the 520th
anniversary of the liberation of Orleans by Joan of Arc.
In Wichita, the Deputy Mayor of Orleans took part in a
festival which included a reunion of veterans of the United
States 137th Infantry Regiment, the liberators of Orleans
in World War II. This regiment was composed largely of
men from Kansas. Across the ocean in Orleans, the Mayor
of Wichita participated in the traditional Joan of Arc
festival.
Committees in both towns worked out a joint pro-
gramme. In Wichita, radio recordings of the celebra-
tions were made in English and French and exchanged
with transcribed messages from Orleans.
Wichita schools, camera clubs and civic
organizations collected school supplies,
art objects, pictorial materials, manual
training and sports equipment to be
sent to Orleans. Arrangements were also
made to send a group of Wichita citizens
to Orleans in July and August as"com-
munity ambassadors".
Educational Aid
. OME 15 other communit : es in
J Kansas, formerly the centre of
America's"isolationist belt', are
forming friendships with European cities
or towns through the Kansas State
Commission, which now has over 40 Coun-
ty Councils for Unesco affiliated with
it. Shipments of donated education'all
. and cultural materials to schools, uni-
versities and other institutions in Euro-
pean towns will be a feature of this
long-range programme for international
understanding.
The Kansas programme has been for-
mulated with the aid of Operation Demo-
cracy, a non-profit American ageny
which since 1947 has helped to"pair off"
over 250 American and European com-
munities. At this agency's offices at
369 Lexington Avenue, New York, there
is a waiting list of 40 more American
towns anxious to affiliate with comma-
nities abroad.
Most of the"adoption"towns are
located in five European countries-
France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
Germany and Italy. Unexplored fields
now being considered DY operation
Democracy are Korea, India and Yugo-
slavia.
Origin of Plan
*) m' HE exact origin of the town affi-liation idea is rather difficult to
trace in the welter of grass-roots
experiments in internationalism which
overtook America during and after World
War II. It is known, for example, that
Hudson, Ohio,"adopted"Souburg, Hol-
land, as early as 1943, Some of the
overseas relief agencies also used the
town-to-town formula as part of their
fund-raising campaigns in the United
States.
The movement gained its greatest
impetus, however, as a result of the
wide publicity given to the"Dunkirk
(New York)-to-Dunkerque (France)"pro-
gramme on Thanksgiving Day, 1946. ln
autumn, 1947, the town of Locust Valley,
Long Island, affiliated with the French
town of St. Mere-EgIise. With no little
optimism, Locust Valley proceeded to
incorporate its committee under the
name of Operation Democracy. The name
was as spontaneous as all the rest-a
peaceful mission on the part of ordinary
people, by and for the people everywhere.
This initial project was immediately
successful and drew many requests for
advice from other American communi-
ties. With voluntary aid. Operation De-
mocracy, in January 1948, established
headquarters in New :'ork, defined a
nation-wide programme and set in mo-
tion the machinery to make it work. The
programme was based on these princi-
ples :
People To People
1. Overseas aid at this stage must carry
a personal message from people to peo-
ple. It must be the forerunner of a two-
way exchange of friendships and ideas.
2. The community is a logical medium
for such an exchange. It can be mobi-
lized for action quickly and completely.
It encompasses all phases of social,
occupational and cultural existence, and
its basic structure is the same everywhere.
3. Community action atone internation-
al lines is in itself an important step
toward the reorientation of the nation's
thinking. It dramatizes and brings home
to the people of"our town"the down-
to-earth meaning of what the headlines
- and diplomats are saying.
Operation Democracy undertook the
following concrete objectives :
1. To encourage and develop interest
in town affiliation programmes through-
out the United States, and to explain
these programmes to communities over-
seas.
2. To provide an information service
for American towns, including details on
Communities overseas, advice on local
organization at home, the shipping of
gifts, liaison with voluntary and official
agencies and programme publicity.
3. To co-ordinate the efforts of affi-
liated communities with a loosely knit,
but basically integrated whole, with
common aims and unity Of pUl-po.
4. To keep abreast of changing condi-
tions abroad, diminishing or changing
needs, new cultural exchange opportuni-
ties, etc., and advise American Commu-
nities on these matters.
Operation Democracy saw cieany that
charity as dramatized by posters depict-
ing a starving child, or a ruined city, was
no longer enough. Such woros and
phases as"friendship","people-to-peo-
pIe understanding","grass-roots diplo-
macy"-these were the new by-words
throughout America. The aQency there-
fore stressed that aid per se should he
regarded as one phase of inter-commu-
nity relationship, a token of friendship,
an act between neighbours, that always
it should be preceded, and followed, by
friendly personal contact between donor
and recipient. Finally, that aid was to
be only a beginning in a long-range pro-
gramme of ever-widening contact between
two communities...
0L :.
Work With Unesco
CLOSE co-operation between Opera-
1'-./tions Democracy and various bran-
ches of the United Nations was
inevitable, and this is best illustrated uy
the present work : ng arrangement with
Unesco. Unesco State Councils in the
three states (Kansas, California and
Iowa), where Unesco is actively experi-
menting with popular participation in ; ts
programme, have recommended the Ope-
ration Democracy programme to its local
county commissions, and many local
groups have led their communities into
town-affiliation programmes. Here. in
line with Unesco's international objec-
tives, the emphasis is almost entirely on
cultural exchange and the sending abroad
of educational material and aid) :,.
As the need for emergency relet in
Europe diminishes, Operation Democracy
will urge-as it is now doing-greater
effort in the field of educational reha-
bilitation and purely cultural exchange
along Unesco lines. It will also attempt
to focus the attention of American com-
munities on areas which have been large-
ly neglected in the past. Above all,
however, Operation Democracy will con-
tin sue to expand its field of co-operation
with ALL GROUPS, and ALL AGEN-
CIES, and ALL PEOPLE working towards
international understanding. It is and
intends to remain a service organization
rather than a"movement". If at some
future date a"movement"based on the
town affiliation idea should arise, or 4
some already existing group such as the
U. S. National Commission for Unesco
should decide to adopt the technique on
a large-scale basis, Operation Democracy
will be happy to make available all the
technical services at its command.
TEACHERS,
HOLD KEY
(Continued from page 3)
"Finally, the advances of science have
presented us with. weapons that are no
less effective for our kind of war than for
the self-destruction of mankind.
"In the accomplishment of that task,
Unesco places great hope in Britain.
which has made such a magnificent con-
tcibution through the centuries to the
culture of the world.
"You teachers of Britain-because of
your cultural heritage-are especially
fitted for the task that faces the world,
and for which Unesco exists.
"We must reveal to all peoples, amidst
the differences of language, customs and
techniques, the solidarity and the unity
of mankind.
"We must so bind the peoples together
that they shall achieve a peaceful, and a
better life for themselves and foe their
children-and for, she children of the
whole world."

LAST month, the Indian National Commission
M for Co-operation with Unesco held its inaugural
meeting in New Delhi to affirm the increasingly
important role that India and the countries of
Asia are playing in the development of education,
science and culture.
"Already, India is numbered among the greatest
States of an ancient Continent which history now
summons to new responsibilities. Already, under the
enlightened leadership of H. E. Pandit Nehru, she has
played a worthy part in the United Nations and their

Gandhian Ideals for Peace
"Of all the men of our day,"he said,"he whose

human brotherhood was your own Mahatma Gandhi.
May I, then, pass on to you his definition, for Uneseo,
of the moral and philosophic bases for a universal
declaration of human rights :
"I learned from my illiterate but very wise
mother that all rights to be deserved and prescryed
came from duty well done. Thus the very right
to live accrues to us only when we do the duty
of citizenship of the world.'
"We have taken to our hearts that message." the
Director-General concluded."It will guile our future

ference of Unesco, to be held in May 1950.
Inaugurating the Indian National Commission
Pandit Jawharlai Nehru, Prime Minister of India, told
the meeting-which was attended by over 300 persons
from different parts of Asia-to look at. world problems
against the massive background of rapidly changing
Asia. He stressed the new and vital importance of
Asia in the world today, and the need for moral and
spiritual values, and. an understanding of the basic
problems which have caused"the vast upsurge in
men's minds all over Asia."
"We are today passing through a very vital and
important stage in world history,"Pandit Nehru
declared,"when another shHt takes place in the centre
of gravity. What happens in Asia is likely to have a
powerful effect not only on Asia but also on Europe
and the rest of the world."
In the past. he said, the great problems of Asia
were rather neglected and enough attention had not
been paid to them either in the political or economic
sphere.

Eense that it has descended from the
'ivory tower'attitude."
Noting that most people, in the world
today, do not have some standard by
which they can judge events or policv or
even their actions, the Indian Prime
Minister said :"Unless you find some yard
measure, some standard of values, it will
not be good for us or for humanity. I
think it is the business of Unesco to see
to it that these values are maintained."
N an impressive extemporaneous
Sir S. Radhaknshnan,chairman of Unesco's Executive
Board and one of the leading thinkers of
India today, stressed the non-political
character of Unesco, reminding his
audience that if they had a quarrel with cerain
political leaders this did not mean that they
were quarrelling with the literary figures of those
countries. H cited Goethe and Kant, Tolstoy and
Dosto Dostoevsky as examples. must learn."he
said."if it wishes to survive-and the only wav it can
survive is by surrendering part of its sovereignty and
serving a common world society."
If humanity desired to develop a world society, he
added, it must develop and educate people in world
citizenship and make them understand that that their
national loyalties must be subordinated to the patriot-
ism of the whole human race.
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Minister of Education,
in his inaugural address, expressed the hope that the
Indian Commission would serve as the focus of the
nation's educational, scientific and cultural activity,
that it would help to enrich national life in those
fields and also make for better co-operatioa and
understanding with other countries.

a desire to help, but what I want is a mental apprecia-

sense that certain problems dominate the world."
Behind the political aspect, Nehru continued. lay all

fiA\11 TA\ILIIM'.. í<.
THE GANDHI METHOD
,... \.
Of  Education for Life 
BY"
HUMAYUN
KABIR,
Joint Educational
Adviser to the Gov-
er1l1nent of India
and author of"Man
and Rivets".
I El\10V AL of illiteracy is perhaps
the most stupendous problem
that faces India on the attain-
ment of her independence. Her decision
to become a secular democratic state adds
to the urgency of providing for the
adequate education of her teeming mil-
lions.
The importance as well as the difficulty
of the task may be measured by the fact
that almost 85 % of the Indian people are
illiterate, and yet the future safety,
welfare and progress of the State depend
on the decisions which they may take.
In its task of liquidating illiteracy, the
National Govcl !'nment fac, on the one
hand, the problem of the education of
children of school-going age. This would
train the citizens of the future.
Of even greater immediate urgency is
the education of the adult illiterates. For
them. mere literacy is not enough as they
must exercise the rights of citizenship
even while they are undergoing instruc-
tion in the letters.
Fee* children of school-going age, the
Government have adopted a programme
of basic education. The aim is to provide
free compulsory education for all children
between the ages of 6 and 14. The magni-
tude of the problem can be realized when
we remember that such children number
about 45 millions. There are the prob-
lems of school build. nags and of providing
funds for the expenses of education.
Besides, the lack of trained teachers
makes it impo3Sible to bring all these forty-
five millions under immediate compulsory
education.
Three 5-Year Plans
T HE Government have, therefore, fram-ed three 5-year plans for achieving
this end.'Th2 first 5-year plan aims
at bringing about 50 % of the children
between the ages of 6-11 under compulsion.
At this st3ge, only the more populous
villages will be taken in hand and com-
pulsion will be extended by age groups
from year to year. Thus, in the first year,
all children of six plus in villages with
a population of 1, 500 or more will be
brought under compulsory education. The
next year compulsion will be extended to
children of seven plus and so on. The
second 5-year plan will extend compulsion
in the same manner in the scattered and
less populous villages. The third 5-year
plan will extend compulsion to all children
between the ages of 11-14.
For adult illiterates the governments
programme aims at providing instruction
of a somewhat different type. Experience
has shown that adults are not attracted
by a merely literary training. Instruction
for the adults is, therefore, conceived as
Social Education. Such education will, in
addition to the introduction of literacy.aim at the production of an educated
mind among the adult illiterates.
As befits citizens of a democratic State,
the instruction will seek to inculcate in
them a lively sense of the rights and
duties of citizenship. There wJI also be
instruction in the laws of personal and
public health. The adult reroonds most
quickly to an economic incentive. His
economic interest will be roused by offer.
. ing him information that may enable him
to increase his earning capacity. Social
Education also aims at training and
refining his emotions through art, litera-
ture, music, dancing and other recreative
activities. Most important of all, it will
emphasize the principle of human brother-
hood and seek to impress on the adult
the necessity of toleorating. as essential to
democracy and peace
lrHE programme of social educationwill, in the first instance, be con-
fined to people between the ages of
15 and 45. Special emphasis will be placed
on the education of women and grown-up
girls. Educated mothers are the surest
guarantee to the education'off the next
generation. The target is the achievement
of 50 per cent literacy in this age-group
within the next five years.
In order to prevent a relapse into
illiteracy, the interest of adult literates
will be maintained through clubs, discus-
sion-groups, summer school, and similar
agencies. The aim will be to make the
village school not only a place of instruc-
tion for children but the centre of com-
munity life. On certain days in the week
the school would be reserved exclusively
for girls and women.
Emphasis on Activity c','.,
- Mr HE essential feature of both basiceducat, on for children and social
education for adults is the emphasis
on activity.
It was Gandhiji who first tried to apply
on a large scale this principle of teaching
through activity. He went further and
held that the activity must be social in
significance. This is the essence of craft.
He said that craft must be used in the
education even of the child. Education
based on a craft would not only help to
develop his faculties but give him a
consciousness of performing a social func-
tion from the very beginning of his life.
In addition, learnini through a craft
would help in making education accessib1e
to all. Our present economic backwaol'dness
cannot be denied. We cannot afford an
expensive svstem of education, however
desirable it may otherwise be. Basic edu-
cation would help to solve the problem of
finance, as it is at least partly self-
supporting. The very small child may not
produce objects that are useful, but the
product of the older children would have
some social use. Even if they have no
market outside, they can be used by the
school itself.
A Danger To Be Avoided
THERE is, no doubt, a danger thatsuch a system may turn the school
into a factory for exploiting child
labour. This, however, would be an abuse
of basic education and there is no system
in. the worid which cannot be abused.
Whether for the child or the adult, the
activity is a means to education. Educa-
tion is, therefore, the end and the craft
the means, but as Gandhiji would say,
the means and tha ends are distinct but
not separate. Provided it is remembered
that it is a school training citizens of the
future and not a factory tuning out
goods for current consumption, there is
nothing wrong in insisting that the pro-
ducts even of children must be good. In-
sistence on quality is, in fact, a part of
education itself. If a thing is to be done
at all, i : ought to be done well.
1ro IWrite about the Indian litera-
H tures of to-day is an undertaking,
in scope and form, comparabl  to
discussing the literatures of all Europe.
One can give an impression only, a
silhouette at best Shrimati Sophia Wadia,
the founder-editor of the Indian P. E. N.,
has written :"A renaissance has been
taking place in modern India under the
impact of the literatures of the West."
It is that aspect which I wish briefly to
touch upon.
There are at least ten important
languages in India, all active and vital.
Among these must be included English,
which is the language of the intelligentsia
and a unifying force* par excellence. Its
importance can be gauged by the fact
that there are a thousand English periodi-
cals in Bengal alone and as many others
in South India. It is significant that the
Hindi and Urdu works of the great novel-
it Premchand, for instance, are very
rarely known to readers in other parts
of India except through their English
translations.
R a bin d ran a t h Tagore is known
throughout India large : y through his
English renderings of his own works ; in
fact, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for
his translation-interpretation would be
more apt-of his own Bengali poems,
Gitanjali. Iqbal, the great poet of the
Panjab, is only known to readers outside
his province due to Herbert Nicholson's
translation of his monumental poem : The
Secrets of Self.
Poetry
II N. what has come to be styled Indo-Anglian Literature, several writers
have made a remarkable, if not al-
ways great, contribution to literature.
R. C. Dutt produced in brilliant hexameters
The Ramayana and the Mahabharata,
and introduced for almost the first time
India's great epics to the English-speak-
ing world. Toru Dutt, whom Edmund
Gosse called"the fragile exotic blossom
of song", produced superb poetry before
she died at twenty. And in the realm of
poetry one cannot omit to mention Saro-
jini Naidu's Sceptred Flute, which has
won world-wide acclaim, the mystic and
lyrical poetry of the sage Sri Aurobindo,
and Rabindranath Tagore's GttanjoH.
High praise must also be Riven to Bharati
Sarabhais'The Well of the People and to
the poetry of B. Rajan and Harlndranath
Chattopahyaya.
The Novel
II N the novel special attention must begiven to Mulk Raj Anand, (whose
Coolie, written directly in English,
has been translated into thirteen lan-
guages), Humayun Kabir's Men and
Rivers, R. K. Narayan's The English
Teacher, Bhabhani Bhattacharya's So
Many Hungers, Raja Rao's Kanthapura ;
in the short story by R. K. Narayan, in art
criticism by Ananda Coomaraswamy's
The Dance of shivs ; in autobiography
by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and in mis-
cellaneous and philosophical writing by
K. S. Srinivasa Iyengar, Swami Viveja-
nanda, Mahatma Gandhi and Professor
Radhakrishnan.
By and large, the literature produced
in English is tinctured by Western techni-
que and is therefore a superb synthesis
and so in many ways much more inter-
national. (1)
AGORE and Iqbal are giants. Bothwere poets of the same stature but
Tagore was a father of many forms :
he was a novelist, short story writer,

His astonishing genius-because so all-
embracing-has not as yet been fully
evaluated. Both Iqbal and Tagore realized
that culture could not survive without
being re-oriented and re-valuated ; that it
was essential to have it replenished and
invigorated by external influences ; that,
in fact, it was necessary to be a universal-
ist. Tagore was the genius who, while re-
maining completely Indian, was a true
world citizen.

modern Indian literatures and their every

a venerable figure bowed down

just returned from a tour of Persia.
where he had been a guest of the Em-

some trouble and he found it very dif-/-
ficult to breach in. a crowded atmos-
phere. Yet he had come to pay his res-
pects to another great compatriot of his,

magic of his personality. One could
"feel"the prsence of greatness. In his
beautifully made robe and with his silken-
white hair he looked as if he had just
stepped out of India's glorious past. He
was at once a hope for the future.
I look back on that day with a sense
of pride because for once in my life I
was not disappointed in the presence of
greatness.

Bengal had just begun,"he wrote."The
light of the past age was then failing
but had not quite gone out. I was able
to get some idea of it from behind,
partly by suggestion and partly from
personal experience. There were many
things in it which showed signs of senile
decay, the weakness and laxness of which !.
might make O, 1e f ('el ashamed, if judy eyed
by modern standards. Yet certain other
things were discernible in those days,
which like the rays of the setting sun
amidst the shades Of evening cannot be
debited to the sièp of darkness..."**
Tagore's eariy tfe as spent in the
wonderful SpiiH o Upanishadic learni : 1g,
and also in : the hotbee'of the most ad-
vanced radical thought then prevalent
in Bengal. He thus passed early through
the fever of favid nationaEsm at a time
when many educated Indians were pried-1
ing themselves on the exclusive use of
the English language.
While still a young boy, Tagore went.
to Europe to study literature. This was ;
perhaps a turning pcint in hLS develop-t
ment. HencefJrth he began to give ex-.
pression, perhaps unconsciously, to the
masterly a&si'n : ; ation of the two cultures
which his analytical as well as highly
creative brain was capable of doing.

from foreign writers and titans like Shaw,
Kafka, Rolland and Gide are always in
vogue. Short stories, especially French,
American, Russian and English, are spe-
cially in demand, as are also travel diaries
and sketches and modern poetry and lite-
rary criticism. The thirst in short is al-
most insatiable.
The Modern Theatre
lrHiS has been the state of arfairsduring the last few years. Plays
have been written and produced
but these are mostly adaptations, transla-
tions or social farces, sometimes satires
or simply social or political propaganda.
So much attention has been given to the
facile form of the radio feature that the
creative capacity of most playwrights
seems to have been atrophied and
crushed. In the garden of poetry it is
different ; peasant poetry has been written
and lyrics have been sung and fine com-
positions made by Bachhan and Josh
and Hafeez. In the realm of poetry, at
any rate, the inspiration has not been
stilled and some exquisite poetry has
appeared. The general tendency is to
appeal to the masses.
The New India is emancipating itself
slowly from the shackles of foreign
"isms". Literature is to be measured by
the extent to which it enriches civiliza-
tion. Civilization may have its national
features or geographical profiles but it
must transcend all geographical boun-
daries. Literature is an expression of
what elevates man ; its aim the culture
ot the mind and its main effect to
ennoble it.
There must and will be a"rehabilita-
tion of the past"and, to use the words
of Ananda Coomaraswamy,"a process of
creative introspection preparatory to re-
newed activity... In India, as in Europe,
the vestiges of ancient civilization must
be renounced : we are called from the
past and must make our home in the
future. But to understand, to endorse
with passionate conviction, and to love
what we have left
behind is the only
possible foundation
for intellectual and
spiritual power. If
the time has hard-
ly yet come for
the creation of new
values... let us re-
member that time
and suffering are
essential to all cre-
action :'
(1) If one were to enumerate some or the
big names in the contemporary Indian litera-
tures, in the various languages other than

SCIENTIFIC STRIDES
OF MODERN INDIA
By S. N. SEN
Registrar, lndian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Calcutta.
II NDIA'S outstanding contribution to
abstract philosophical and religious
think ; ing often tends to o scure her
equally important contribution to posi-
tive sciences. In fact, the study of scien-
ces in India is as old as her civilization
itself, which is contemporaneous with
that of ancient Sumer and Babylon. The
savants who meditated and experiment-
end on the banks of the Ganges and the
Indus not only enriched life morally
and intellectually, but also made living
easier through their many inventions and
discoveries in mathematics and astro-
nomy, chemistry and metallurgy, medi-
cine and botany. These have left their
permanent mark in world science.
Cross-fertilization of ideas among men
of science from different lands, as an
essential conditions of progress and
advancement, has been a characteristic
feature of Indian Science, as of other
fields of knowledge, over the centuries.
India has given to others as much as
she has received from them. Thus Arab
mathematics was considerably influenced
and enriched by India's progress in this
science, and learned Indian mathemati-

led is free.. \Vr. er words come out from

Throughout his tong and intensely
active career, Tagore
wrote over three
thousand songs and
poems. His short
stories are gems of
prose composition. In
these he depicted the
lives of common people with sympathetic
insight, revealing their problems and
portraying their courage under suffering.
His plays and novels give a masterly
analysis of the historical and social forces
which gave shape to India's literature.
Dominated Literary Scene
T AGORE'S influence on the writersas well as on the rest
of India, has been overwhelm : ng.
He dominated ice literary scene of his
dative Bengal for such a long time that,
with the notable. exception of the novelist
Sarat Chatterjee, no new school of litera-
ture grew up in Bengal for nearly sixty
years.
A veritable Tagore cult developed in
Bengal where young writers and artists
even copied the port', handwriting and
spoke in the languages of Rabindranath's
poems.
When, at the age of sixty, Tagore took
to painting, it created a sensation not
only in India but in the salons of Paris
where his tableaux were on view. His
manyfold genius is too intricate for
detailed description in this short article.
He absorbed Is'9mic and European cul-
tures and wro : e extensively in English-
a language he enriched by his deep
philosophical essays and translations of
his original-work in Bengali.
Rabindranath is perhaps the only
Asiatic poet wi whose genius was recog-
nized all over : he world during his own
life-time. Honours were heaped on him
by learned societies and humble institu-
tions alike. Mass adulation haunted the
poet everywhere he went. in the cause
of India's literature For his Hibbert Lec-
ture in 1931, he chrose "Religion of Man"
as his subject. Here was a synthesis of
all that was best-in the philosophies of
the East and t.'1e West. Here was a ray
of hope and faith that transcended the
time and space of our civilization.
RabindranaLh Tagore died in 1941 when
the world was again engulfed in a con-
flict against waich he had preached and
practised for so long He lives in the
heart of every man and woman and
child in India because he belived that
his mission as a poet was"to attract the
voice that was 23 yet inaudible in the
air ; to inspire faith in the dream that
is unfulfilled and to bring the earliest
tidings of the unborn flower to a sceptic
world."
Rabindranath Tagore
"Poet Laureate of Asia"
cians were invited to the Court of the
Caliphs to translate the monumental
mathematical works bearing the general
name"Suryya Sidhantikas". It is well-
known that the concept of the zero and
imaginery numbers, which originated in
India, reached Europe via the Arab world.
In a similar way, Indian astronomy, par-
ticularly the experimental and observa-
tional astronomy, as then existed, came
under the strong influence of contem-
porary Persian developments.
Modern Science Comes
To India
I N recent years, the flood-gates ofmodern science have been opened to
irrigate her fields of thought and intel-
tectual activity, which long remained
barren and unproductive. Already there
is the unmistakable sign of her returning
fertility. The brilliant crop of scientists
she has produced during the last fifty
years permit us to hope that before long
India will contribute to the general body
of science as effectively as any other
nation.
In experimental and mathematical
physics, Indian sc : entists have already
found an honoured place among the
international community of physicists.
The late J. C. Bose carried out some of
the earliest research in wireless trans-
mission and on the sensitivity of living
plants. C. V. Raman who was awarded
the Nobel Prize, gained world fame for
his work in the scattering of light and
molecular and crystal physics of M. N.
Saha in nuclear physics ; H. J. Bhabha
developed the first. convicing theory of
cosmic rays and fundamental particles,
while the. noted Subrahmanyam Chan-
drasekhar, now in the United States, has
contributed to stellar dynamics and
astrophysics.
(Continued on page 9)
System of'Untouchables"
Abolished
VOR countless generations, the system
. ofuntouchables"has hung like a.
curse. over India. Mahatma Gandhi, who
had revolted against this concept and
practice while still a little boy, dedicated
himself, along with many of his coun-
trymen, to the battle against"untoucha-
bility".
"It may be a mere dream", he wrote,
"as unreal as the silver in the sea-sheU.
It is not so to me."
On another occasion he declared,
"Swaraj (self-government or indepen-
ce) is a meaningless term, if we desire
to keep a fifth of India under perpetual
subjection, and deliberately deny to them
the fruits of national culture".
Last January, a little over a year after
Swaraj, the Government of India passed
a constitutional law abolishing the sys-
tem of"untouchability". This revolution-
ary development coincided with the
adoption of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights which India is thus doing
her best to implement.
The new law grants full citizens'rights
to every Indian, irrespective of sex or
socia ! status. This means that, for the
first time, millions of former"untoucha-
bles"will have the right to vote when
the general elections are held in India
next year.
In other ways too, the former
"untouchables"are being given new op-
portunities. Places of worship, from
which they were barred, have now been
opened to them. In Bombay, the Govern-
ment has already opened schools two them
on the recommendation of a committee
which included Dr. Ambedkar, once an
"untouchable"himself and now India's
Minister of Justice. Under the Govern-
ment's ten year plan, all Indians are to
be fitted to plays full part in the life
of their country.
With a deep faith in
the cultural federation
of different races and
peoples of the world,
he devoted himself, in
his writ : ngs and teach-
ings, to the cause of---.....,-,.-----
unity and. friendly co-operation with the
West.
"Humanity is torn by suffering and
suspicion,"he wrote,"by a disharmony
which has wrought havoc in the very
depths of our lif. on earth. It is for us,
of the Brothechood of Letters, to rescue
humanity from this misery of unnatural
relationship... To whatever land we may
belong, this mJSt he our common mission
on this plane of united effort, to achieve
goodwill between man and man, establish
a secure foundation of fellowship which
will save humanay from suicidal war..."
Tagore saw his people ia India and
in Asia achieving this goodwill and
es. tablishing a solid foundation of fellow-
ship not by a'tempting to wi !) e out their
differences-which he believed neither
possible nor desirable-but by accepting
them :"unity not in spite of the dif-
ferences but through them,"he wrote.
"Let all human races retain their own
individual personalities and yet come
together,"Tag) re said elsewhere,"not into
a uniformity tha* is dead, but into a
unity that is living"
Tagore was called the Sentinel of the
East and the Poet Laureate of Asia. His
writings have been translated into almost
all the major languages of the world.
When his book of poems Gitanjali
(Song Offerings) was published in 1913.
Europe aid the rest of the Western world
were enchante. J. W. B. Yeats records how
intensely he was moved by the mystic
qualities of the poems. Recognition came
in the form of the Nobel Prize for
Jiterature-the f'rst time an Asiatic had
thus been honoured.
In one of the poems of Gitanjali, Ta-
aore prayed that his country might awake
Santiniketan-Abode of Peace
IN 1901, Rabindranath established aneducational centre called Santinike-
tan (Abode of peace) at a small
place named Bolepur, some 93 miles from
Calcutta. There he adopted the ancient
ideal of, forest hermitage to modem, con-
ditions. Twen : y years later he converted
it into a world university called Visga
Bharati, 50 taut it became not only a
centre of Indian culture but of world
culture. Tagore's life's work had begun.

THE ARTISTIC REVIVAL IN INDIA
Music', THE DANCE, PAINTING
IN India we speak of the
m sixty-four arts, but so deep
M has been our degeneration
within these three or four cen-
turies that only music has remain-
ed the most tradit_onally alive and
technically developing expression
of the aesthetic creative force in
India. The Moghuls were great
lovers of music and, as such, the
mus : cal tradition, especially in
North India today, is very vigor-
ous and capable of absorbing
more new tendencies.
Like all things traditional, how-
ever, the new can only be absorb-
ed in terms of the principles al-
ready established and even when
it takes a new form the change
is ultimately imperceptible. The
great musician Abdul Karim
Khan was no inferior to the
masters of the Indian musical
tradition, but yet it carried a new
element of the modern without
hurting the established principles.
He and his disciples are without
doubt to-day the most impressive
examples of the Indian tradition
capable of adapting itself to mod-
ern conditions. The famous school
of music in Lucknow is an
example of this new spirit.
But in the South, where the
tradition continues in a more vir-
ile form, the public still has a
taste for the forms which have
not changed perhaps for several
hundred centuries, and music still
Dance rules dating back over
2, 000 years are still faithfully
observed in India to-day.
Using a"language"of ges-
ture, posture and movement,
the dancers can portray epi-
sodes from Indian epics, ex-
pressing such varying emotions
(rasas) as love, pathos, wrath
or fear.
Their techniques include
movements of the feet and
anktes, and body bends, each
of which signifies something
visible. The neck, head, eyes
and eyebrows are all brought
into play, the three fundamen-
tat eye gestures alone express-
ing 36 feelings.
Hand and fingers signs (mu-
dras) are used to extend the
"story telling"code. For one
hand there are 38"mudras"

plays an important part in the
lives of the people. You could
walk almost anywhere in the
streets of South India and hear
some of the finest of classical
music and also see representations
of certa : n traditional patterns of
Indian dancing.
Traditional Dance Forms
II N fact. Indian traditional
II dancing is still a very vitalpart of South Indian social
life. Whether it be in temple or
courtyard, or home, the hand
symbols and eye movements and
foot work of the famous Bharatha
Natya Sastra are still to be seen
practised, and in Malabar the
Kathakali traditions of dancing
are so popular that almost every
week troupes move from village
to village, dancing the story of
one of the great epic characters,
Saint. Hero or Mother. And in
the North, particularly in the
various States ruled by Mahara-
jahs, the northern school of danc-
ing called Kathak still flourishes
with its most complicated foot-
work. In the East of India, the
Manipari school of dancing has a
recovered grace which is lost else-
where.
There is no doubt that Indian
dancing is one of the forms of
Indian traditional art that will
effect a very great change in the
dance techniques of Eurooe, once
it gets known. The success of a
dancer like Ram

paintings, a sincere effort has
been made to link up the
contemporary and the past. The
results have not always been
happy, as the neo-classical was
of a sentimentality that seemed
unbelievable in any vigorous ar-
tistic revival. However, the crea-
tive efforts of a few Bengali pain-
ters and the genius of certain
painters trained in European
techniques discovering the Indian
mode of sensibility, such as in
Amrita Sherghil, produced some
interesting experiments and a few
great achievements. It must be
confessed nevertheless that India
to-day has no great painter,
whereas she has poets, musicians
and dancers who are inferior to
no one in the preceding centuries.
Assimilation of the Past
"oriHE Indian problem in the
arts-at in her social and
intellectual problems-re-
mains the same : the revolt
against the past has only made
for the inevitability of the assi-
milation of the past. In fact, tra-
dition based as it is on unchang-
ing principles, has a capacity for
adaptation which surprises one.
The Indian artist has no fear to
be modern, because, for him, to
be modern is only to manifest the
contemporary mode of a classical
expression. Realism or change
cannot make him afraid for they
are only methods of renewal at
the level of expression and not at
the basis itself. Indian artistic
tradition thus proves to the world
that the metaphysical is the only
recurrent discovery of every re-
vival. Hence, there is hope for
Indian art.
Contemporary Indian Films
For International Understanding
By
Kwaja Ahmad Abbas
who is thf ! sponsor oj the In-
dian Peoples'Theatre Move-
ment has an intimate know-
ledge of modern trellds in the
'ndian film industry and there-
fore writes on them with
authority.
If'OMP ARA TIVEL Y speaking,
India has had practically
no opportunity of export-
ing her culture through the
medium of the cinema. The
few Indian films that have
ever crossed the seas have
been seen by very limited
audiences, and it is still doubtful
whether they. will ever be able to
compete successfully with Amer-
ican and European products in
the foreign market.
But there Is no reason wny an
attempt should not be made to
secure at least a specialized and
select audience abroad for the
right type of Indian films. Some
of our Ambassadors have already
taken stel>8 to secure good Indian
films for'exhibition in their Em-
bassies. Film societies, cultural
organizations and educational ins-
tautions in all countries would
surely welcome op) Ortunities of
seeing, from time to time. a re-
presentative selection of Indian
films.
But it is important that fore'gn
audiences should learn to look at
Indian films as a mirror of Indian
life, and should not expect that
universality of interest which the
standardized product from Hol-
lywood is able to provide. The
foreigner is sometimes apt to
complain that Indian films are
inordinately long, though none
of them so far has beaten the
record of Gone With The Wind.
It is true, however, that the
tempo of story developmenr in an
average Indian film is slower
than in its Holly : wood counter-
part. So, to a foreigner, it seems
longer.
This criticism applies not only
to film making but to a whole

The preponderance of songs in
an Indian film has been it. most
exasperating feature for foreign-
ers and even for westernized In-
dians. The commercial (and,
therefore, primary) reason is that
the cinema in India has develop-
ed into an omnibus entertainment
for millions of uprooted peasants
and small town folk who have
lost their rich traditions of folk
song and folk dance and found
nothing to substitute it in the
cities and the by towns.
Again, through religions musical
expressions like ttrtoH, bhajan
and qawwali, the song is woven
into the fabric of Indian life more
closely and intimately than in
any other country.
What kind of Indian films
should be shown abroad ? There
can be as many answers as the
different varieties of films pro-
duced by us. Some would favour
mytholog :. eal and puranic films
as they represent the"spiritual"
heritage of India ; others would
favour the historical films about
our emperors and empresses to
show to the world"the Glory
that was Ind". No doubt their
colourful pageantry would appeal
to the Western audiences as they
approximate more closely to the
average Westerner's notions of
the"exotic"East.'
The modem-mended ultra-
realists would ban the export of
all such films and insist that
only films on contemporary
themes should be sent abroad.
But again there would be diver-
gence of views as to whether it
is advisable to send out some of
our films which expose our Social
evils, as that might create an un-
favourable impression about In-
dia.
If the task was left to me, I
would select the following teh
films for internation-exhib. tion.
The Indian actress Jayasree in
the title role of Shakunta ! a, the
Indian film version of the
Sanskrit classic by Kalidasa.
I wouldn't say they are the Ten

Population Problems Of India
by Dr. Sriþati Chandrasekhor
PART. II
In our April issue, Dr. S.
ChaMdrasethar, head or the
Department at Economics, Anna-
malai Universit1l. Chidambaram,
Indian, discussed some ot the main
causes underlying the population
problems of Pakistan and India. ! pn : x o/PcMtan OKd 7 ? : dt0.
We pub ; ish below a second
article in which the author
examines possible answers to
these problems. The two articles,
in expanded form, will shortly be
published as part of the Unesco-
: : ponsored"Food and People"
pamphlet series.
Last months, Dr. Chandrasekhar
concluded b1l stating that the
population problem has to be
considered in relation to the means
of sustenance, main'y food supply.
II NDIAN agriculture is characterized,
by primitive methods of farming,
dependence on the vagaries of the
monsoon, sub-division and fragmen-
tation of land, consequent on the Hindu
, and Moslem laws in inheritance (which
, enjoin the succession to immovable pro-
. perty by all male heirs, usually in equal
, proportion) leading to uneconomic hold-
ings and to excessive dependence by the
majority of the people on land for
livelihood.
The primitive technique of Indian
'farming is responsible not only for the
low yield per capita, even when compared
to countries like Japan and China, but
also for the gradual deterioration of land
with soil erosion and deforestation.
This does not mean, however, that
there is no scope for improving Indian
farms and their yields. According to 1939
official statistics, one third of the culti-
vable land in both India and Pakistan
lies idle-not fallow.
Thus of a cultivable area of 432 million
acres, only 53 per cent is sown with crops,
11. 8 per cent is fallow, and no less than
35. 8 per cent of land is cultivable but
left waste.
India has, therefore, not exhausted thejléifpply of her cultivable land, and what
is cultivated appears to be eroded and
exhausted because of the primitive tech-
nique of farming. With modern methods
or agricultural science, of erosion preven-
tion and soil reclamation, the cultivated
land can be made to double its present
yield and bring much of the so-called
; cultivable waste under profitable culti-
. fvation. Such an improvement is welcome
; but it will touch only a fringe of the
problem.
''while increased yield and more acreage
. (if cultivation are possible with the aid
., off science, they cannot by themselves
afford a better standard of living to the
Indian population, or completely solve the
population problem, unless and until a
substantial number of people now depen-
dent on land are transferred two some
other productive employment like indus-
trtes.
lndustrializaiion
INDUSTRIALIZATION is often offer-ed as a stock remedy for Indian popu-
lation problems. The industrialization
that has taken place in India durin the
last thirty years, however, has not helped
to ease population pressure because it
has been piecemeal and unplanned, and
the percentae of population gainfully
employed in modern industry has been
less than one per cent of the total popu-
lation.
Only planned large-scale and rapid in-
dustrialization and the development of
cottalte industries-there need be no con-
flict between these two-can keep pace
witil the growling population and siphon
and Pakistan
off the surplus population from the over-
crowded land to factories.
India's industrialization is important
in the solution of her population prob-
lems for two reasons. It will increase
the oroductivity of labour and create an
abundance of badly needed commodities
and services and transform the present
economy of scarcity into an economy of
abundance. Secondly, and this is probably
more important for India, industrialization
will encourage the development of new
urban patterns of living which lead to
the control of the high birth rate.
Migration
WHAT about migration as a soln-
tion to the Indian population
problem ? As far as external or
international emigration is concerned,
there seems to be no opening, because
the World has not reached the stage for
the adoption of an international migra-
tion policy based on the just needs and
available resources of various countries
and peoples. And once we grant, as we
must, that every country must have the
right to determine the composition of
her population, India cannot object to
the unwillingness of certain countries,
however thinly-populated they may appear
to be, to receive large numbers of Indian
immigrants.
Nor does India want to create unhappy
minority problems as in the Union of
South Africa. The total number of In-
dians settled overseas as permanent
immigrants to-day number about four
and a half million, but the annual in-
crease of India's population is about five
millions. Even were emigration outlets
available, it is unreasonable to expect a
major portion of this increasing popula-
tion to leave their homeland. For India,
such relief may not even be a permanent
solution.
As for the possibility of internal migra-
tion as a method oi relieving the popu-
lation pressure, there is not much scope
either, because there are no empty spaces
within the geographical confines of India
and Pakistan.
CERTAIN patterns of inter-provincial
migration established in India dur-
ing the last thirty years show that
inter-provincial migration has been
constantly going on. We have no reliable
figures, but these population movements
are more of a seasonal migration and do
not have any permanent effects. And
then. when one group of people have
moved out of a certain province, another
group of people seem to be moving in.
So the net result of such inter-and-
intra-provincial movements does not seem
t'constitute any relief to the pressure
on the land.
If migratory movements between differ-
ent regions are to be explained as a
response to the"pull"of prosperity from
less crowded areas, rather than the
"push"of poverty from overcrowded areas,
there are no regions in India where the
standard of living of the masses is
markedly higher than in the rest of
India. Thus, whatever the internal mi-
gration that has taken place in the last
thirty years in India, this has been in
response to rigorous famines or the con-
struction of new irrigation projects and
canals, rendering the cultivation of more
land possible.
In these circumstances, internal migra-
tion offers no substantial relief from
population pressure And the partition
of the country, which has already forced
upon both India and Pakistan communal
migrations, renders the prospects of inter-
provincial migration dim.
Birth Control
he last and the most importantsolution is that of Birth Control.
It is too late in the day for India.
to discuss the pros and cons of Birth
Centre !. The arguments for and against
contraceptives have been advanced and
the scientific verdict has been injavour
of it. Birth Control appears to De an
important solution. It certainly has &
vital role to play in India's population
policy, along with the modernization of
agriculture and the industrialization of
the Indian economy.
Apart from the general rural conser-
vatism of the masses that offers resis-
tance to every reform, there is no orga-
nized resistance either by the government
or the church as in some countries. Nor
are the Indian religions opposed to
planned parenthood It will not be &
hard task, therefore, to enlighten the
public mind in India as to the benefits
ot Birth Control.
Human Conservation
ESPITE the unprecedented scientificadvances in the world during the
last thirty or forty years, there is
an enormous human loss in India from
conception to old age. With all the avail-
able resources of scientific knowledge,
skill and facilities for protecting people's
health, and curing or alleviating the many
ills and disabilities to which people are
exposed, India continues to waste thou-
sands of human lives.
Despite our belief in the intrinsic value
of human life as a central value of our
culture, we have offered resistance to
certain reforms that encourage healthy
and purposeful living. Human erosion and
loss, therefore, persist long after they
have become unnecessary because of
certain traditional ideas and beliefs that
still linger from the past.
While belief in"fate"as a controlling
factor is slowly tending to disappear, it
has not disappeared completely. These fate,-
listic beliefs persist in every society, but
much more so in India, long after they
have been rendered obsolete bv scientific
knowledge which is powerless to displace
them.
The way out in thi3 matter is to give
up clinging to archaic ideas and practices
that are no longer valid according to
present knowledge, nor compatible with
democratic affirmation of human values.
SCIENTIFIC STRIDES
... (Continued for page 7),
The late P. C. Ray. the doyen of Indian
science, was almost singly responsible
for building the present Indian schools
of chemistry, now led by such brill) aunt
chemists as S. S. Bhatnagar, J. C. Ghosh,
N. R. Dhar. J. N. Mukherji, K. Venkatu-
raman, P. C. Guha and others. In the
capable hands of Bhatnagar, Ghosh,
Dhar and Mukherji, physical chemistry
in particular has made remarkable pro-
gress in recent timers..
Expanding Research
THIS sweeping reference to the nameand work of a f w prominent
scientists selected at random by no
means represents either the volume or
the intensity of the research now being
carried on in India in various branches
of science. Nor is it intended to attempt
such an account here. What is impor-
tant to note is that efforts to cultivate
the modem sciences, which are hardJy
fifty years old in India, have already
begun to bear fruit.
Thus. judged by the comparatively recent
availability of research facilities and the
extreme poverty of scientific laboratories.
India's scientific achievements which
include one Nobel Laureate and eleven
Fellows of the Royal Society, the highest
scientific distinction in the British Com-
monwealth of Nations. are itself a
glowing tribute two her inventive and
creative genius.
T eclmology
And Industrialization
II NDIA has, however, been less suc-
cues furl in applied research and
technology. The development of these
is closely related to the economic condi-
tion of a country. The primarily agricul-
tural economy of India, with little or DO
development of industries, has so far
militated against the development of
applied sciences. From the experience
of other countries and also from India's
own experience, it is clear that her fu-
ture economic progress will be impossi-
ble of achievement without substant : al
industrialization.
At the same time, it is also true that
the success of industrialization will largely
depend on the country's scientific and
technological ability.
Both the scientists and the statesmen
are now keenly alive to this fact. Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who himself
received early training in science, has
given a fitting recognition to the su-,
preme importance of science in nation-
al welfare by creating a full-fledged
Government Department of Science,
directly under his own responsibility.
One of the principal organs of this
Department, the Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research, has planned a
chain of national laboratories. A num-
ber of these Laboratories have already
been established under the directorship
of able and internationally known scient-
ists, both Indian and foreign.
Closer Ties With Other rations
II NDIA is passing through a momen-) t tous period of her history. Her
scientific ability is the greatest asset in
all the steps she is now taking for future
development. Need for intensive collabo-
ration with other nations in the fields
of pure and applied sciences is greater
than ever. For this reason, she specially
welcomed the establishment of Unesco
and of its Field Science Cho-Operation
Offices, one of which is now functioning
in India and has already proved of great
service. Such scientific collaboration will
not only benefit India but all the nations
of the world.-

...... Unesco Message To Woodpulp Conference in Montreal
From forest to paper mill : (right to left) logs move
downstream to pulp-mashing vats before being pressed
through paper making machine from which they emerge
as newsprint-ready for the rotaries.
, World Radio Caravan
Proposed. for Unesco
A plan to use mobile radio
equipment for recordings
programmes of Unesco
interest in different parts of the
globe, We recommended by a
committee of radio experts meet-
ing at Unesco House, Paris early
this month.
The committee suggested that
radio produc3rs from different
national organizations should be
invited to collaborate in produc-
ing these programmes.
It considered that the first of
these tours, if approved, could
cover several European coun-
tries and begin next Spring. If
this plan proved a success.
Unesco might examine the
possibility of developing similar
projects in other parts of the
world.
Dr. Torres Bodet told the
radio specialists that everything
would be done to obtain approval
from Unesco's General Confer-
ence to make these tours
possible.
The committee, which include-
end leading radio personalities
from France, Switzerland, Bel-
gium. Great Britain, Brazil, the
United States and India, met to
review the work accomplished
by Unesco's Radio Unit during
the past few months. I : con-
gratulated the Radio Unit on
the standard of its work and the
results already obtained and
expressed the view that the Unit
should be given all necessary
means not only to pursue but to
increase this activity.
Over 30 countries are already
making use of the scripts and
recordings sent out from Unesco
House, Paris, including the
weekly"Unesco World Review".
The committee called for an
increase in programmes along
the lines of the recent"Music
and Folklore"series to which
seven countries contributed.
AMONG the different products of
wood there is one of particular
importance to Unesco, because it
is a material essential to the spread of
education and scientific and cultural knowl-
edge. and to the development of mass com-
munications. That product is paper and,
especially, newsprint.
unesco, ever since its establishment, has
given particular attention to the problem of
the world's needs in respect of paper and
newsprint. The : ; urvey of the technical
needs of the press, radio and cinema,
which has been systematically conducted
by our Organization since 1947 and which
by the end of this year will have covered
44 countries, has made it DOssible to show
what these needs are.
The experts who have met each
year to examine the results of the
survey have stressed the dangers
of an insuffic : ent supply of news-
print from the three standpoints
of the independence of the press,
social progress and International
understanding. Their reports have
been published.
Although the world's produc-
tion off newsprint today ex-
ceeds pre-war revels, the supply
cannot meet the real present-
day woriå needs. The shortage
threatens to grow even worse
unless energetic ste. ps are im-
mediately taken to speed up
and expand production.
This message from Dr.
Jaime Torres Bodet, Director-
General of Unesco, was read
More Than a Commodity
or the 1948 Commission report-tt ed the situat'_on in these
words :
"The supply of newsprint is of
paramount impørtanee to the
achievement of the aims off Unesco.
Under present conditions of short
supply, newsprint should be con-
sidered as very much more than
a commodity. A limited supply
tends to hinder the freedom of
expression. A serious shortage
prevents the pre9S frolD fulfillinl'
its chief function of providing in-
formation to the peoples or the
world.
The Alarm Sounded
II N this spirit, and on the basisof these data, Unesco has
repeatedly drawn the atten-
tion of the United Nations to the
problems of an insufficient pro-
duction and unequal distribution
of newsprint : firstly, to the Sub-
Commasion on Freedom of Infor-
mation and the Press, and, again,
to the Conference on Freedom of
Information held in Geneva in
the Spring of 1948. That Con-
ference adopted a recommendation
which is now before the General
Assembly of United Nations, its
text being as follows :

Needs of Intellectual

im* 0-DAY is Unesco's first oppor-tunity of making itself heard
in a Conference of experts
where the requisite degree of com-
petence is brought to the consider-
ation of the various technological
and economic aspects of the prob-
lem, and for this I wish to express
my gratitude to the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the
Canadian Government. In par-
ticular, it gives me great pleasure
to take this opportunity of testi-
fying publicly to my, satisfaction
at the co-operation which has
developed in this matter between
my Secretariat ant that of the
Food and Agriculture Organza-
tion.
It is my earnest wish that this
co-operation between Specialized
Agencies whose work is comple-
mentary may be an augury of an
endeavour by governments to find
a solution foc the problem before
us which shall take account at
once of the hard facts of econo-
mics and the requirements of
human society, of physical neces-
sities and spiritual aspirations.
In this as in everything else it
is the requirements of society and
the spiritual aspirations I have
mentioned which inform Unesco's
viewpoint. Unesco's point of view
is that of the public and those
. who serve the public : of the few
seeking to express themselves, of
the masses crying for education,
of sundered peoples seeking to
know and understand each other.
In a word, Unesco approaches the
question-that of paper like all
others-from the angle of the
needs of intellectual and social
progress. For Unesco, that is a
duty embodied in its Constitution
and repeatedly confirmed by suc-
ceeding General Conferences.
In execution of that duty-
which nearly all the states here
represented have made their own

consideration the following re-

May 1949 UNESCO COURIER 11
WHAT IS"DEMOCRACY" ?
We publish on this page extracts
from a few of the replies received
by Unesco in response to its en-
quiry into the current ideological
controversies centering around the
key-word"democracy".
These represent only a very small
selection of the 30 questions and
over 80 replies- (many more than
20 pages in length) which philo-
sophers, historians and social scient-
ìsts from all parts of the world sent
to Unesco.
The results of the Unesco enquiry,
along with a selection of the replies
received will probably be published
in book form.
QUESTION :"To what dent will you
agree that the word'democracy is
ambiguous ?"
Answer give by Professor Richara
McKeon, University of Chicago :
The word"democracy"is ambiguous
not in the sense that many different
formulae have been proposed to define
its meaning, but in the sense that many
different interpretations have been
proposed and elaborated for a formula on
which there has been remarkable con-
tinuity of agreement. Very few discussions
of democracy, adverse or favourable,
would be distorted in interpreting"demo-
cracy"as the"rule of the people in their
cwn interest''. The ambiguities in the in-
terpretation of this formula arise from
two interrelated sources : (1) the deter-
mination of the means by which the
people may"rule in their own interest"
and (2), the determination of who the
"people"are. The discussion of the first
source of ambiguity turns on defining
terms like"law","order"."freedom", and
"equality", while the discussion of the
. second source turns on the relations
between pairs of contracy terms such as
"the many and the few"and"the poor
and the rich".

very widespread that there is no such

differing with different historical, social
and psychological conditions : there its
Athenian democracy, Mediaeval demo-
cracy, Bourgeois democracy, Proletariandemocracy. Soviet democracy, but no
'general democracy'. To what extent
would you subscribe to this opinion ?".
Answer newer given by Professor Charles
Bettelheim, University of Paris.-
. Bourgeois Democracy is a democracy for
the bourgeoisie and a dictatorship for the
proletariat. When bourgeois democracy
is in its most democratic guise, this
dictatorship takes the fonn, essentiaily,
of an ideological dictatorship ; it imposes
oi) the proletariat (by means of the
school, the church, the press, radio, film,
etc.) views and ideals designed to
maintain the supremacy of the bour-
geoisie. But the weapons of material,
violent dictatorship-the police, army,
law courts and prisons-are always
ready to hand, and are resorted to
whenever the proletariat, as for instance
on the occasion of a strike, strays from
the path which the bourgeoisie wants it
so. follow. They are also resorted to when
the ideological dictatorship is weakening
and the proletariat subscribes to an
ideology other than that of the bour-
geoisie ; the latter then attempts to
substitute open dictatorship for the
former masked dictatorship, and bour-
geois democracy disappears.
Proletarian democracy, in its turn. is
a democracy for the proletariat and a
dictatorship for the bourgeoisie.

hat. often been taken as a point of
departure for clarifications of the essen-
. tial criteria of'democracy' ; the preposi-
tion of indicating the obedience of the

the decisions taken by the government,
and the preposition for indicating the
value of these decisions for the general
:'welfare of the people.
'"How far do these formulations cor-
:'respond to your own interpretation of
the Lincoln formula"
Answer given by Professor Charles
Perelman, Brussels University :
Lincoln's definition of democracy as a.
government of the people, by the people,
for the people, has been very popular
with the practitioners of political philo-
sophy, because, taken out cf its contest,
it can always be interpreted to suit oppos-
ing political ideals. It is enough either tc
Confusion In Use
of Term Studied
T HE ples of the world laymen no less than experts have never been
more conscious of the conflicting and contradictory ideas which
surround them than in r cent y arn. Ideological conflicts are presenl
et'erywhere, between nations, within nations, between minds,
wtihin minds.
Few Irords have. played a greater role in these disagreements than the
wird "democracy". The problem is one of vast implications. It is not just
a question of terminology. It has its background in contrasts of historical
development, of social condition, of political patterns. It is deeply entangled
in the immense cluster of problems raised by the impact of technology and
industrial civilization on Ihe lives of peoples everywhere. Il is not only a
probl"m of phylosophy-it is a problem or war or peace.
Although many have tried to analyze the causes and responsibililies for
disagreements, the problem has not yet been attacked an the internalional
level within the general framework of organized efforts towards international
understanding.
. N order to bring a little more clarity into. present-day discussions. Unescoun rtook a vas enquiry, n on the concept of, d mocracy. A questionnaire
was sent to 500 philosophers, historians, jurists, economists and to all to all
Unesco National Commissions.
Their, armed rith the replies (small parts of which are reproduced on
this page), a committee of experts from six countries meet in Paris ellrly this
month"to consider the causes of ambiguity and confusion in the present
use of the term "democraty" and their role in politicla disputes today."
7n a In a concluding declaration, signed by all six members, the committee
found that there are not fixed and extreme poles of divergence all that
there are abundant indications of undamental agrreements."
Understanding is possible, the statement said, if "alleged facis are
treated as facts and contrasted with facts " and if "ideals and theories are
tHated meated as aspirations and contrasted with other expressions of purpose and
intentions."
The, Ieclaratian admitted that"clarification of the presellt-day ideological
conflict... is not in itself sufficient to insure peace, " adding however, that
it would"serve to separate the real issues from the problems which arise
from confusions of statement."
"CLARITY of statement", therefore, "will make understanding possible"t and by.. alatlllg the problems, it will simplify the towl s, tuatlOn
and permit the concentration of attention on practical issues and possible
auctions.'
The declaration noted that "for the first time in the history of the world
me doctrines are advanced as anti-democratic" and added that "even the most
sharply contrasted forms of dempcracy share a common traditon of
humanism."
The six experts admitted that"these basic agreements in datement are
ourlain with a great complexity of disagreements" but pointed out that
"power rivalries tend to sharpen the ideological conflict into two opposed
positions and to conceal the great variety of theories and parties."
In ad, additio", the declaration continues,"the fact that the ideologicol
cOllflict is not between two fixed alld extreme views... affords grounds for
the expectation that the conflict of idealogies may be clarified... The
clarification of the issues will attenuate the effect on the general public of
propaganda tending to incite to violence."
T lIE statement concludes with the fallowing,., words :"Ultmately theresolution of ideological conflicts depends on free interchange of
information, of cultural materials, and of persons. The peoples of the world
cannot inderstand each other in all the diversities of their cultural, social
and political lives... without freer and fuller contact with each other."
Members of the committee who, drew up the report were Sergio Buarque
de Hollanda (Brazil) ; Edward H. Carr (Great Britain) ; Richard McKeon
(USA) : Charles Perelman (Belgium) ; Pierre Ricoeur (France) and Alf ; and Alf
Roos (Denmark).
give a slightly different interpretation to
each part of the definition or to stress
one particular part. I have myself inter-
preted rhe phrase"gonrnment of *he
people"as prov : ng that the people are
the source of power in. a democracy, for
I do not see in what way the obedience of
the people to the government is peculiar
to democracy any more than to any other
political system. It is difficult to say
whether this defimtion represents three
essen : ial principles of the democratic
system of government, because it is too
vague to be the basis of an exact criterion.
It is : n fact possible to intervre : and
adapt this definition in such a way that
it is applicable to systems whose demo-
cratic nature is open to doubt.
.
QUESTION :"Shoutd'democracy'be
used to cover a narrow concept, a polio-
ical concept designating methods of
decision-making, or should it be used to
cover a broad eoncept, a social-political
concept designating conditions and
methods as well as results of decision-
making"
. Answer given by Professor C. l. Lexis,
Harvard University :
To say that anything should be done
implies some criterion ot correctness. But
the understood meanings of words are
themselves the criteria of their correct
usage. Unless or until there is a clear,
understood, and agreed upon meaning of
"democracy'* the Question whether"demo-
cracy"should be used in one way rather
than another is a question which has no
answer. Any answer offered will merely
exhibit a preference or prejudice of him
who answers.
.--
QUESTION :"Can a'democracy'in the
narrow sense fulfil any of the requite-
ments it involves if nothing is done to
make it democratic'in the broad
sense ?"
Answer given by Dr Max Nomad, of
New York :
It cannot ; for under such a"narrow'
system the enormous majority of the
voters, in view of their unrelieved poverty,
might be tempted to sell their vote to the
highest bidder ; or else that majority
could easily faU for the promises of
various to : alitarian demagogues, thus
enabling them to do away with the exist-
ing system of"forma]"democracy for the
sake of a despotism parading as a
"broad", or"proletarian", or"people's"
democracy.
QUESTION :"Is'political democracy'
the best means to achieve the goal of
'Social democracy' ? Is'social democracy'
the best means to achieve the goal of
'political democracy' ? Is'political
democracy a means to any sincle goal
at all ? Are the two concepts at all
related as means to ends ?"
A Answer given by Professor Quincy
Wright, University of Chicago :
I think nk political democracy and social
democracy are reciprocally related as
means and ends, that is, either may be
treated as means and the other as end
according to the general philosophy of
values an individual may have. As a
practical matter. I think that under most
c : rcumstances, it is more expedient to
begin-with political democracy with the
anticipation that progress in political
democracy will develop social democracy
as has been illustrated in the case of
England. Political democracy, however,
implies reasonable security and literacy,
and perhaps, reasonable prosperity. It is
clear that the geographic position and
resources provided these conditions in
England and the United States more
than in any other-country. It is therefore
not surprising that political democracy
would have developed first in these coun-
tries. The present world situation of closer
international contacts, but a continuance
of power politics, undoubtedly creates con-
ditions unfavourable to political demo-
cracy. conditions which can only be
solved by world organization giving
greater assurances of security to all
states.

QUESTION :"To what extent do you
consider the strict distinction between
the concept'method of decision making'
and the concept'contents of decision
made'a justified and fruitful one ?
What arguments would you think val-
id for supporting the tendency to reserve
the word'democracy'for the method of
decision-making, thus rejecting it as a
broader term comprehending the condi-
tions, the methods and the contents of
the decision-making ?
The attacks upon this line of arguing
have not lagged behind in violence.
Answer given by Humayun Kabir, NeW
Delhi :
What is interesting to note in this
connexion is that the protagonists of
"democracy"and"socialism"are, in spite
of their violent disagreement about the
relative values of liberty and equality, at
one in their dissociation of means from
ends. The". democrat" emphasizes liberty,
and insist that whatever be the result,
the method of taking decisions is what
matters. So long as the appearance of a
free political decision is there, it is im-
material to him whether the consequences
bring social justice or not. In other words,
he is concerned only with the means and
not with the end. Equally, the"socialist"
who insists that equality must be establish-
ed in every sphere of life, whatever be
the method adopted for achieving it, is
prepared to flaunt his adherence to the
view that the end justifies the means.
Thus the two agree in the divorce of
means from ends even though to one it is
the means that alone matters, and to the
other, the end.
To sum up. even if ends are not means,
means and ends are so related that each
modifies the character of the other. The
condemnation of an end must, therefore,
necessarily lead to the condemnation of
the means to it. Contrarily, if the mean
are indefensible, this would immediately
rouse doubts about the justification of
the end itself.

QUESTION :"Does'democracy'presup-
pose general agreement on fundamental,
indisputable principles within the groups
it is applied in : if so, what are these ?".
Answer by Dr. A. C. Ewing, Cambridge
University :
I. do not think democracy presupposes
general agreement on any fundamental
principles except this one :-that the
differences between the rival parties are
not sufficiently great to warrant their
settlement by force."
X
QUESTION : Is there any incompatibilUy
between the ultimate political aim
described by Lenin and the aims pre-
claimed by other idealists to be of
ultimate or intrinsic value ?".
Answer given bJl Professor Stanislas
Ossowski, Warsaw University :
When we follow the discussion between
the ideological adversaries in the two
camps on questions of principle, we are
struck by the fact that there is no lack
of a common language. The case is
otherwise in their discussions with the
partisans of racialism-with those who
acknowledge the swastika. Both. in stat-
ing the reasons for their programmes,
invoke the same values, though the
emphasis is not placed on them in the
same way. The condmnation of the
western democracies, which is delivered
by the advocate of the socialization of
the means of production, is not a con-
demnation of the cult of freedom. The
battle with economic liberalism, the battle
with bourgeois liberalism, can be engaged
under the banner of a liberalism dif-
ferently conceived. The argument in such
discussions is, in general, designed to
show that the other camp has betrayed
or debased the ideals to which both
adversaries have subscribed. In saying
this I do not mean to under-estimate the
essential differences between the two
camps, the differences between their
scales of values and their ways of react-
ing to various present-day facts in social
and political life. We shall, indeed,
examine how it is possible to arrive at
such sharp ideological contrasts, whe : l
the main postulates in each case have
been the same. In this way we shall also
throw some light on the divergenq of
meaning attached to the word "de-
mocracy*.

1. 2 UNESCO COURIER May 1949
More Newsprint Production Urged
(CUßiUß&\ ææ iææ
(Continued from page 10)
II T is a fact that, since the endof the war, there has been an
appreciable improvement in
the world production of newsprint.
This is man ; nay due to the increase
of North American production,
which has risen by 25 % in four
years. To take an instance, Ca-
nada is today producing over a
million tons more than in 1945
(which, including Newfoundland,
makes a total of 4. 535. 000 tons,
or 60 % of world production).
That is a remarkable effort, to
which tribute may properly be
paid.
World production today exceeds
7 1/2 million tons ; the average for
the period 1935-1939 was slightly
lower.
This brings us to the first ques-
tion., whether this output is suf-
ficient ; and Unesco's reply is an
emphatic negative.
In Unesco's eyes there is a
serious shortage which threatens
to grow progressively worse in the
coming years and decades unless
m'e now take eneagetic steps to
speed up the expansion of pro-
duction.
MARKET DEMAND VERSUS REAL NEEDS
A T this point I should like to
revert to the notion I have
just mentioned of the in-
tellectual needs of the peoples of
the world.
I know that the newsprint de-
mand for 1949 has been calculated
at about 8, 200, 000 tons ; in view
of the estimated production, the
margin left will be small. Even if
governments abolished the restric-
tions on the import of pulp, coal
or paper called for by the present
exchange position, and we sudden-
ly reverted to a universal system
of free trade, demand would pro-
bably not greatly exceed 9 112
million tons. That is a target by
no means unattainable if it is
borne in mind that there is today
an unused productive capacity
amounting to nearly 1, 400. 000 tons.
But what do the figures mean ?
Merely that those are the amounts
of newsprint which governments
or the press think could be bought
and consumed commercially. They
do not mean that those are the
amounts which peoples should
consume to be properly informed,
yet that is the real standard.
To assess correctly-that is, in
terms of humanity how far pro-
duction is adequate, its relation to
demand is not enough. Demand is
a market phenomenon which very
imperfectly reflects the real de-
sires of the community and still
more imperfectly its objective
needs. Today more than ever
. before, there are too many factors
keeping demand to a minimum
below the real requirements of
social and international progress ;
financial restrictions, politics, lack
of resources, and technical igno-
race.
The Ever Widening Gap
II T is untrue to say that the realneeds cannot be calculated.
On the contrary, they stare
us all in the face, and are set
down in black and white in demo-
graphic and school statistics. Now
it is indisputable that between the
needs implied by those statistics,
on the one hand, and, on the
other, production-and, even mere.
quantifies commercially available
- there is a yawning gap,. which
must grow wider in the near fu-
ture.
INDIAN NEWSPRINT
In India, the production of
paper for newspapers and
books is vital for the fig1ht
against illiteracy. Plans re-
cently announced in New
Delhi provide for the manu-
facture of 250, 000 tons of
paper in 1952, including the
first production of newsprint
in India.
Even in industrialized countries
with a low percentage of illiter-
ates, the press does not every-
where enjoy adequate supplies. As
an instance, in the older countries
of Western Europe, the combina-
tion of exchange difficulties, the
general needs of reconstruction
and military expenditure has
made restrictions necessary, re-
ducing consumption to a glaringly
inadequa : e level, although the
productive capacity of those coun-
tries is more than adequate to
their needs. This is true of the
United Kingdom, of France, of
Holland and Italy, where annual
consumption in kilogrammes per
head has swWi respective be-
tween 1935-1939 and 1948, from :
26. 2 to 8, from 8. 8 tò 6. 4, from 12. :
to 6. 3 and from 1. 7 to 1. 3.
Even the United States and Ca
nada, whose joint consumption
exceeds 5 million tons, or 2 (3rids 01
the total world production, anti-
cipate requiring about a million
tons more is. the coming years.
Spurious Equilibrium
HAT then of the vast con-
tinents of South America,
Asia and Africa, contain-
ing 67 % of the planet's popula-
tion but consuming barely 11 % of
the world's newsprint ? Their pop.
ulations are increasing rapidly ; in
India alone the numbers grow by
2, 300, 000 every year and every-
where a political, economic, tech.
nical and intellectual evolution
on an enormous scale is taking
shape and gathering speed, which
demands and is already beginning.
a large-scale expansion of teach-
ing.
In the fourteen years between
1934 and 1948, Uruguay, Ecuador
and Cuba doubled, and Venezuela
trebled, their consumption of
paper ; but it has not been the
same in China, to which we owe
the invention of paper but whose
own consumption per head per
year does not exceed 0. 1 kilogram-
me, despite a 10 % increase in
the last ten years in the numbers
able to read ; nor in India and Pa-
kistan, which are about level with
China ; nor in Siam, which con-
sumes less than before the war
though the number of people who
can read and write has risen by
17 % in seven years ; nor of Tur-
key, whose consumption is down
by 20 % despite the continued
spread of education.
Thus, although production is
up to the pre-war level and the
time is near when it will be equal
to the commercial demand, there
could clearly be no course more
dangerous nor more unjust than
to accept this spurious equili-
brium.
Abnormal,
Unhealthy Situation
ORE than half the world's
n` population is still illiterate.
Yet everywhere there is in-
sufficient paper, and that unfair-
ly divided, for those who can read.
Those are the basic facts which
we must have constantly before
our eyes if we irish to evolve a
plan of production up to the real
needs of humanity. It is a situa-
tion which must be, not accept-
ed, but condemned as abnormal
and corrected as unhealthy. Other-
wise we should be striving to halt
the rising tide of history.
But I have emphasized the extent
of the needs to be met too strong-
ly to omit an indication of a few
steps liab : e to do something to-
wards increasing present produc-
tion.
Some of these steps concern
papertnaking proper, others the
production and utilization of
wood.
With regard to paper-making,
it is important to secure the full
utilization of existing mechapical
capacity : I have already pointed
out that a fraction of this, of
some 1, 400, 000 tons capacity, is
still unused, of which about a
third is in Great Britain. We
must also mention Japan, whose
production has fallen from 400. 000
tons to 100, 000 tons, and Ger-
many, which has not yet reached
half of its pre-war production. I
do not overlook the complex and
often indirect causes of this. I
merely say it is important that
an effort be made to find a re-
medy.
More Paper Mills Wanted
II T is quite clear, however, that,even if present manufactur-
ing capacity were fully uti-
lized and the most up-to-date
methods applied to it, it could
not fill the needs of tomorrow in
particular. In the circumstances,
it appears necessary to consider
the large-scale build-
ing and equipment of
new factories, notwith-
standing the enorm-
ous difficulties due to
the high cost of ma-
chinery where prices
are 2 1/2 tunes above
the pre-war level, and
to the considerable
time-lag involved. Des-
pite these difficulties,
projects of great in-
terest are under con-
sideration or in hand
in var : ous countries.
Such efforts must be
encouraged and, if
need be, assisted, for
instance, by arrang-
ing to supply these
countries with engi-
neers and technicians.
Similarly, if only to
economize in the use
of forest reserves, it
is desirable to stim-
ulate research into
the possibility of replacing wood
pulp, in part at least, by
other materials such as straw,
rice straw, sugar cane fibre,
rushes, bamboo and certain tropi-
cal growths. Unhappily, it must
be admitted that the experiments
so far carried out in this con-
nexion are far from conclusive as
regards newsprint, which must
conform to specialized standards
to be capable of being handled by
high-speed rotary presses. The re-
sults so far obtained, like those
of the various methods of salvage
by remilling or de-inking of old
paper, cannot do more than pal-
liate the shortage. However, as I
said before, the needs are so great
and so urgent that no supplement-
ary source should be overlooked.
Priority for Five Trees
lrURNING to wood production,it is not for a layman like
myself to offer the least
suggestion to such experts as you.
Nevertheless, where the use of
wood by the paper-making indus-
try is concerned, no one can fail
to be struck by two outstanding
facts.
The first is what I have no
hesitation in describing as the
very small percentage represented
by paper-making in the total fig-
ures of timber used. During the
last few years that percentage has
been reduced still further, parti-
cularly in Europe, by the urgent
needs for fuel, building material
and textiles consequent on the
ravages of war. Even in Canada,
UNESCO TO RYE-PUBLISH
Out-of-Print Periodicals
Important out-of-print period-
icals may soon be available in
microfilm or photo-offset re-
productions, according to a
plan recently devised by Unes-
co as a result of numwous re-
quests made by war-damaged
and newly established libraries
and research institutions for
help in obtaining copies of
such journals.
As the first step in this plan
Unesco has selected a small
number of out-of-print period-
icals to be reproduced and has
contacted the original publish-
ers. When final arrangements
have been completed, lists of
the periodicals indicating re-
production costs and other
data will be circulated to pos-
sible subscribers. Microfilm or
photo-offset copies will be
made, accerding to request, by
contracting with commercial
establishments.
I am assures that paper-making
has never accounted. for more
than 17 % of the total lumber
felled.
The other fact regarding the
utilization of wood by the paper-
World newsprint consumption.
making industry is the extremely
small number of species suitable
for manufacture into newsprint.
Despite the experiments carried
out in a number of countries on
certain tropical timbers, the usa-
ble species remain the fir, balsam,
poplar and spruce ; recently the
Mediterranean pine has been
added to the number ; it has given
excellent results in the Southern
United States and has the added
advantage of quick growth.
These facts seem to me to in-
dicate the lines which internal
tional co-operation should follow.
I am of course well aware that
wood has to serve many put.
poses vital to man. Nevertheless, I
should like to ask this Conference
to consider the possibility of include.
ing among the recommendations
to be addressed to Governments,
a proposal to raise the percentage
of timber production set aside for
paper-making. At the very least,
I think it is necessary to give
priority in manufacture to the
use of the species enumerated
above.
UNEQUAL NEWSPRINT DISTRIBUTION
IL ASTLY, there is a fourthpoint which I think it my
duty to put forward, con-
cerning not the production but
the distribution of newsprint.
In the case of the principal pro-
ducers distribution is still gov-
erned by the commercial commit-
ments in force before the war.
Consequently, little account is
taken of the new needs arising
from the tremendous political
and social upheavals in the world
during the last ten years. Before
the war distribution was already
almost exclusively to industri-
alized countries, and this ten-
dency halt : bees aggravated in the
post-war years by the unequal
purchasing power of currencies,
and, in particular, by what has
been called the"dollar famine".
This has resulted in certain coun-
tries'exporting a proportion of
their output to countries with a
harder currency although their
own domestic market is inadequa-
tely provided for.
These two factors together have
resulted in extreme inequality of
consumption. Enormous areas of
the world are practically without
supplies, and in the very areas
where there is the greatest need
to intensify the battle against
ignorance, resources are most
lacking. In this connexion Unesco
has produced statistics showing
annual consumption per head in
kilogrammes. These figures do not
call for much comment and I
shall quote a few examples only.
While the United States'con-
sumption per head in 1948 was
32. 4 kilogrammes, that of China,
India. Pakistan and Syria did not
exceed 0. 1. The equivalent figure
for Canada is 21. 3 ; for Australia
and Sweden 18. 2 ; for New Zea-
land 12 ; for the Argentine 9. 7 ;
for Switzerland 9. 2 ; and for Den-
mark 9 ; IWhile it is 1. 7 for Greece,
1. 6 for Poland and Brazil, 1. 3 for
Italy and Portugal, 1 for Colom-
bia and Peru, 0. 9 for the Philip-
pines and 0. 4 for Ceylon.
World population.
With Goodwill Destroy
Inequality
) t T is not for Unesco to suggesthere remedies for this situa-
tion. But it is Unesco's duty
to appeal on each occasion to the
goodwill of all in order to correct
as far as possible such inequality
in the distribution of a product
so essential for the intellectual
and social progress of humanity.
It may be that the general plan
of this preparatory Conference
which is concerned with all the
problems relating to the various
uses of timber, may forbid the
necessary exhaustive study of the
questions I have raised. Should
this be so, it is my hope that a
special conference should be call-
ed at a later date to be devoted
solely to the question of paper
and newsprint.
I should like, however, already.
in wishing you all success in your
work, to thank you again for giv-
ing me the opportunity to join
my efforts to yours. I know that
my appeal will not have been in
vain. Between those who supervise
the growth of trees and those
who are devoted to the education
of children, there is a natural and
undeniable sympathy.
