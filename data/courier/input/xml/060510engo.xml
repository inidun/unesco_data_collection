YOUTH
WITH
A PURPOSE
by René Maheu
Director-General of Unesco
u NESCO has a special duty to accord a
maximum of attention to young people, for as
an institution dedicated in its entirety to the forging of
a new spirit in the relations between men its work would
signify little if the youth of the world failed to grasp its
purpose and to associate themselves fully with its goals.
The problems facing the young people of today are a
matter of worldwide concern and indeed urgency. Of
course it can be said that to some extent all the charac¬
teristics of present-day youth, their attitudes and psycho¬
logy and behaviour, their tremendous pent-up energy which
can overflow into generous altruism or blinding violence,
are not so very different from the character of any younger
generation.
But never does youth offer as faithful a picture of its
true spirit or show its virtues so strikingly or its faults so
glaringly, never are the talents of youth so richly exploited
or youth's love of risk put to greater test than when the
world itself is in a state of rejuvenation as it obviously
is today. And it is this surge and momentum in all the
manifestations of youth today, intensified by the throbbing,
accelerated rejuvenescence of the world itself that is, in
my opinion, the key ponderable of our time.
The statisticians inform us that young people under
25 years of age make up more than half the total popu¬
lation of most of the developing countries. These young
nations which have now emerged on to the stage of history
are youthful not only because their emancipation is so
recent. Intrinsically, they are far more youthful by virtue
of the fact that the development and leadership of these
nations is_ in the hands of the rising new generations.
As for the so-called developed countries, where the
infrastructure of society is well established and the nations
are in a much better position to absorb their rising popul¬
ations, it is inevitable I mean mathematically inevitable
that the young people will be called upon to assume an
increasing role in national growth and expansion since as
is well known technical knowledge is advancing with such
giant steps that yesterday's technology is often out of
date by today.
While it may not be exactly true to say that adolescence c
is the age for artists, even if one has pop singers in 3
mind, it is quite certain that an engineer of 35 must pick
up his studies where he once left them off (assuming of

YOUTH WITH A PURPOSE (Cont'd)
Destined to become the cause of history
course that he made the mistake of not going on with
them) if he is not to find himself out of step with deve¬
lopments in his field.
Let us not forget that our technologic civilization is a
civilization of the young and that it is destined to become
even more so every day. Young people now know more
and even understand more than their elders (I am not
saying that their judgement is better) for the very good
reason that invention and newness are becoming increas¬
ingly the underlying basis, the why and wherefore of
everything we do, if not everything we think at least in
so far as the economic sectors of society are concerned.
Whereas in times gone by tradition and our heritage from
the past represented the mainspring of our knowledge,
our force and action, nowadays it is the present moment
with its most recent innovations, and even projections into
the future, that dictate what portion of our past ic useful
or indeed meaningful to us. It is as if time had sudden¬
ly changed its course, and effect had become cause.
It looks as if youth is destined more than ever before to
become the cause of History.
It goes without saying that all young people are not
alike. They form no homogeneous group and their
behaviour is as varied as the multifarious situations they
live in. By definition youth is a subject of .controversy,
for youth itself is a mosaic of controversies.
Irrespective of what opinions we may hold about the
younger generation of today, I think everyone will agree
that governments can no longer afford to ignore the
millions of youth who are now erupting into the life of
all nations. Nor can governments ignore the need, or
the urgency in certain cases, for erecting new educational
structures to serve not as ramparts for maintaining the
status quo but as wide thoroughfares capable of integrating
all young people into the communities of the future.
But the changes that are taking place in our technical,
economic and social patterns of living are occurring with
such amazing speed and on so staggering a scale that
even modernized, newly equipped school systems can no
longer cope with the educational needs of present-day
youth. Little wonder then that out-of-school education
is coming to be looked upon as of increasingly paramount
importance for the young.
Admittedly there is an urgent need for more schools,
more trained teachers and regular revision of the
curriculum. These are basic to everything. But I trust
it will offend no one if the former teacher in me remarks
that it is in the nature of lower and higher educational
systems to change very slowly.
That is why I firmly believe that in our rapidly evolving
world it should be supplemented and constantly revitalized
by a different type of education, where rules and
regulations are as relaxed as possible, where recourse
to textbooks, examinations and diplomas is cut down to
a minimum, and where virtually no attempt is made to
impose on youngsters the rigid patterns of regular school
programmes and classroom procedure. In a word, a form
of education open to everybody and which provokes and
encourages initiative and experimentation.
This, as I see it, is the fundamental aim and purpose
of out-of-school education. It can be of help to young
people who have never had a chance to get an education,
or to those who have been to school for only a very brief
period and have forgotten almost everything they learned;
it can be of help to youngsters who, once they have left
school, want to pursue their training and education, or
to those who while still continuing their studies need a
more open life and environment than the school can offer
to broaden their horizons and prove themselves in the
face of true-life experience.

<![CDATA[
Out-of-school education thus offers youth a wide choice
of conditions and methods. By its very nature it is
dynamic and in permanent evolution, not unlike the younger
generations it has been devised to serve and the world
they live in. In recent years it has undergone profound
modifications: there have been important changes in youth
movements, new youth groups and institutions are being
created, and it would be interesting to study these along
with the role that adults play in them as well as the
influence that the press, radio and television have on
them. Government youth services have sprung up
everywhere and many have become Ministries for Youth.
This too is a phenomenon well worth studying, for with
these new youth ministries out-of-school education for
young people has attained official status and has become
a government affair. To some this is an excellent
development; to others it is likely to stifle initiative and
discourage voluntary youth aid. Be that as it may, the
subject is certainly too important to be ignored.
I do not endorse the idea that we adults should speak
in youth's name. This is a vain pretension and an absurd
illusion. We should do our utmost to understand the
younger generations and let them know our deep concern
for their problems. But we should avoid pressuring and
manoeuvering them into becoming involved in our terrible
disputes and controversies.
By this I am not implying disapproval of the idea of
engagement, of youth's involvement in the current affairs
of the day. Becoming involved is part and parcel of
youth's nature. Youth is characterized by its impatience
to take part in history. And nothing, it seems to me, is
more natural than that this should start on the ideological
level, for are not ideas the main road on which the
motorcar of youth is tested and run in?
Let there be no talk then of our ignoring the enthusiasm
of youth, even if we do feel that it sometimes results in
premature decisions. What really counts is that this
enthusiasm be free and spontaneous and that the decisions
reached be logical and clear-headed.
We have no intention of trying to mould youth into a
mirror-image of adults, of taking advantage of their faith
and fervour to serve adult interests and passions, or of
crushing their spirit under the weight of our technical
superiority. Our purpose instead must be to help the
younger generations to be themselves so that youth's
eternal promise of regenerating the world is never lost.
Is helping youth really so difficult? I do not think so.
I am not one to believe that a misunderstanding between
the different generations is really inevitable, nor that
revolt is the necessary way to enter adult life. On the
contrary, I am convinced that young people naturally, look
to us for some decisive gesture that will unlock for them
the secret of their own selves and of the world around
them.
Are we so removed from that enchanted age that we
have forgotten it? - For hundreds and thousands of years
the same situation has been repeated with every
generation. Each generation expects the older one to
usher in a world that is not a prison. By prison I mean
a barred destiny, a world without love.
Ruthless entanglement of ancestral feuds, blind walls
of ignorance, misunderstanding and prejudice, bottomless
pits of collective egoism where men founder, without
realizing it, ramparts of fear and hatred extending to infinity
like the reflections in parallel mirrors, sinister battlements
of distorted truth behind which crouch the extremist beliefs
in the inevitable division of man, turning neighbour into
stranger and reducing human beings to the level of
animals. If that is the heritage we propose to leave to
our children, it is quite understandable, indeed it is both
desirable and necessary that they reject it with horror.
But is this the world we are going to leave behind us?
This question, which is the only one that really matters,
is the one we invariably come back to whenever we turn
our attention to the problem of youth. For what we call
the problems of youth- are after all no more than our own
responsibility as adults.

of Unesco, at the opening of the International Conference on
Youth, in Grenoble (France), on August 23, 1964.

AN
EXPLOSION
OF VITALITY
by Pierre François
I
8
F today's teen-agers could take time out to
think a little about the past, if they felt they
still needed ancient heroes to inspire their thoughts and
fancies, then I have no doubt that they would pick as their
models men like Columbus, Copernicus, Galileo and
Erasmus.
Though they may not exactly realize it, this age of ours
is not unlike a new Renaissance. Accepted attitudes and
traditional ways are being openly challenged everywhere,
voyages of discovery are uncovering the still hidden secrets
of our planet, the horizons of man and of the universe itself
are being pushed back steadily, and we can behold a new
flowering of scientific and spiritual vitality.
Young people are indeed fortunate that we have returned
to an era in which everything can be called in question
and everything begun anew. Their voices are now heard
loud and clear echoing across the land: before their
onslaught the walls of the most venerated universities shake
and tremble; young composers are revolutionizing our
concepts of music and of music notation itself; and the most
hallowed tenets of philosophy, politics, ideology and religion
are being stormed by the rising generations.
With the new technical means at our disposal our
world is being studied as never before, and the transfor¬
mations we have wrought on earth excite the keenest
interest and inquiry. It is not just for sport that so many
young speleologists risk their lives to explore deep under¬
ground caves, nor is it mere escapism that prompts youths
from Genoa, or anywhere else for that matter, to go off
in search of a new world.
The Copernican system of the heavens has in a sense
also assumed new relevance today. In just a few decades
mankind has come to realize above all the new genera¬
tions that reached the age of twenty since 1945 that no
single individual or nation can remain fixed and immobile
in the centre of the world, and that all are drawn into
a universal process of struggle and progress.
Thus the Danish boy in his ultra-modern Copenhagen
classroom is now deeply conscious that the problems and
sufferings of an Asian boy or girl directly affect him as
well; adolescents from the United States, the Soviet Union,
Nigeria, Peru, Great Britain and a host of other countries
are all joining hands to help, build new roads and erect
new schools; from every side one finds a growing desire
on the part of youth for communication with others and
common action.
As we see how youth is surpassing itself in every field
of human endeavour one is tempted to say, for more
reasons than one, that the sky is no longer the limit.
There is certainly a parallel to be drawn between the many
records broken at the Tokyo Olympics, which an athlete
of ancient Greece would have considered impossible and
unbelievable, and the recent "walks in space" by Leonov
and White, which early balloon pioneers would have looked
upon as equally unbelievable and impossible.
And up to not so very long ago it was rarely possible
for persons in government to attain to high positions of
responsibility and leadership except after many years of
service and experience. Today's youth is impatient with
these old ways, and despite the grumblings of old-timers
have pushed their way to the top in virtually every branch
of public and private activity.
In literature, too, an analogous situation now obtains.
Most novels about youth have been the work of older
writers who have had to rely on memory to describe the
ways of adolescents. Now, youngsters (a surprising number
are girls) are turning out graphic, best-selling accounts of
the contemporary teen-age scene almost as soon as the
ink is dry on their graduation certificates. Similarly, the
current craze for very young "beat" singers has spelled
disaster for many a veteran singing star of variety stage and
TV screen.
HOSE who consider pop music decadent or
unworthy of serious consideration, will find a
better case in point in the scientific laboratory. It is said
that scientific research is made for those who have not
been preconditioned by the theories and technology of
yesteryear, and that after 35 a mathematician, for example,
has passed the prime of creativity. It might be interesting
to draw up a list of all Nobel prize winners in science
during the past twenty years along with their age. No
doubt it would show that while many of them became
famous after forty, their most creative work was accom¬
plished in their early and late twenties.
Agriculture is another sector of a nation's economy which
needs new ideas and technical skills as never before. Here
too, young people have moved to the forefront, and with
energy and determination have taken the leadership of
movements working for social and technological agrarian
reform.
The newly independent countries are sometimes referred
to as the "young" nations partly, I suppose, because of
the young (but by no means tender) age of their govern¬
ment officials, cabinet ministers, administration executives,
ambassadors etc. The signs of youth are everywhere evi¬
dent in the more industrially advanced countries too. Thus,
the Yugoslav parliament reserves a number of seats for
representatives of youth. The Soviet youth organizations,

Paul Almasy. Paris On' top of the world, or so it seems to these teen-agers taking a skyscraper's-eye view of
New York. The start of holidays sets off an exodus of city youngsters bound for the
countryside in search of fresh air and exercise. Along with this mass departure there is a counter-
invasion of groups from small towns and villages all eager to see the sights of the big city.
Komsomol, occupy a prominent place in public life. And
the success and popularity of President Kennedy was
certainly attributable, at least in part, to his youthful
appearance and youthful personality.
The fact that so many young people now occupy front-
rank positions in public life could be explained by the
increasing demands of our ever-changing society, but it
would not hold true for long if those involved did not live
up to expectations or were unequipped to meet their heavy
responsibilities.
Actually, the younger generations are a much-maligned
group. By and large they are far more serious-minded
than is commonly thought and prepare the ground for their
future with more assiduity than is imagined. Here "youth
activities" carried on outside the school and the family
home have an important part to play. It is indeed a pity
that superficial observers see in them nothing more than
games and idle pastimes.
Exact figures are lacking as to the number of persons
presently engaged in youth activities, but random surveys
would indicate that from forty to sixty per cent of the
teen-age population in the developed countries devote a
considerable part of their spare time to pursuits that
require varying degrees of effort leading to personal
improvement. Such pursuits are promoted not only by
national youth organizations and sports federations with
their huge memberships but by countless local clubs
which are of special significance in that they operate inde¬
pendently and, on the whole, allow youngsters a freer
hand in running and managing their own affairs.
In the developing countries the percentage of membership
in youth groups is much smaller because of a lack of
trained personnel and equipment, but the reservoir of
young people is such that this gap will certainly be closed Q
within the next few years or so.

sion of teen-age vitality in his country and youth's passion
for exploring and testing everything new in all domains of
human experience. With such an abundance and variety
of activities being carried out on all five continents it is
embarrassing to single out some projects in preference
to others. Luckily, teen-agers themselves have come to our
rescue by expressing their views on those they like best.
A recent survey carried out in the Washington metropo¬
litan area by the Health and Welfare Council of the National
Capital Area in the United States showed that outdoor
activities were far and away the most popular amongst
teen-agers. By this they did not mean that they actually
practised such activities themselves but that they preferred
them to all others. According to the poll, U.S. youths
spend most of their free time as spectators watching
things television as a rule but would much rather do
something else if they had the chance.
This same trend is no doubt to be found in all the
industrialized countries of Europe as well as in Japan, and
it points to a deep-felt need for fresh air and outdoor
activity.
The advantages of sports as one of the best remedies
against the pressures and constrictions of modern life are
now universally recognized. Sports clubs do in fact boast
a much greater membership than do other youth organiza¬
tions. Interesting to note is the recent trend away from
the so-called "pure" sports, such as athletics, towards
the more "utilitarian" forms which help to enhance outdoor
pleasure and holiday-time relaxation.
Thus, while membership in sports federations generally
has increased by about twenty per cent in some countries
in the past few years, certain sports such as ski-ing and
swimming have topped 100 per cent, and others like moun¬
tain climbing and sailing have been gaining steadily in
popularity. Even horseback riding is losing its exclusive
snob appeal and is fast becoming a popular sport.
O great is our modern need for physical
exercise, fresh air and communion with nature
that the briefest holiday spell becomes the signal for
an exodus to forest, mountain and seashore by large
segments of the population. We know how devastating
this rush can be when adolescents fail to find, at resorts
destined for quiet adult tourists, the installations and
wherewithal which their energies seem to need.
Youth organizations, often with public. or private help,
have spared no pains to see to it that children and teen¬
agers alike are given the best possible vacation opportu¬
nities. The lakeside summer camp in the state of Connec¬
ticut which offers facilities for swimming, hiking, canoeing,
nature study, photography, guitar playing and uninhibited
singing sessions, is only one of a galaxy of similar camps
to be found all over the United States and parts of Canada
today.
In like manner, the shores of the Black Sea, Lake Baikal
and other parts of the Soviet Union swarm each summer
with thousands of young Pioneers enjoying the scenery and
the fresh air, or busy on much the same type of fruitful
exercises as their Américain counterparts.
In the United Kingdom, two organizations, in particular,
Rapho. Paris
The Outward Bound and The Duke of Edinburgh Award,
have been most instrumental in developing a series of pro¬
grammes designed to answer youth's keen desire for adven¬
ture and a healthy physical workout. Hiking, mountain
climbing, boating and sailing, and life-saving exercises are
all becoming increasingly popular, with Britain's bracing
climate to help.
France's efforts on behalf of youth are often cited as an
outstanding example. Thanks to the combined action of
various youth organizations and the Ministry for Youth
and Sports, some 800,000 youngsters have been received
in more than 800 open-air centres set up outside industrial
towns and areas. Every year one million boys and girls are
taken to the countryside, the seashore or the mountains as
part of the famous "Colonies de vacances" movement, and
some 45,000 youths are taught mountain climbing and
42,000 sailing in specially created centres.
The first out-of-doors youth movements, however, were
pioneered many years ago by various groups, especially
Scouting and Youth Hostels. These saw that the roman¬
ticism of adolescence was both a healthy and a desirable
sign well worth cultivating. They worked out our modern
techniques of camping life and gave the first real impetus
to tourism of the "rough it" type. The Young Men's and
Young Women's Christian Associations were also in the
forefront of this movement, especially in sports.

The pleasures of a day in the open air with gay companions these
teen-agers are all agreed that this is really something to sing about.
All of these groups have been highly successful during
the past decades and their work is now catching on in the
developing countries too. Thanks to scouting, boys and
girls in the Philippines, Tunisia and Kenya (the full list
would include every nation on earth) can now study the
riches and rigours of mother nature at first hand and in all
her infinite variety.
The youth hostel movement, which first took root in
Germany years ago, has now spread to every country of the
globe, and recently completed a network of hostels in
Pakistan extending into the foothills of the Himalayan
range. The Y.M.C.A., too, has ¡ust worked out plans for a
vast chain of holiday camps stretching across the sub-conti¬
nent of India.
It is impossible of course to mention all the achievements
and trimphs of youth groups today; but one thing is clear:
everywhere, from the frozen reaches of Iceland to the
burning plains of Ceylon, young people are determined
to free themselves, both in body and in spirit, from the
rigidities and strictures imposed by modern as well as
traditional societies.
In both modern and traditional societies youth also faces
a wide range of complex cultural problems. The teen-aget
who lives in a modern community like Munich or in a more
traditional one like Bamako or Bangkok or Belem must
deal with the problem of how to adapt traditions to modern
modes of thinking and expression. In other words, how
to blend the most ancient sources of a nation's wisdom
into the blood stream of contemporary world culture.
Here again we find a striking parallel with the period of
the Renaissance. As Leopold S. Senghor, President of the
Republic of Senegal, put it in an address to the youth
of his country: "You must stay within the framework of the
collective consciousness for this will develop and sharpen
your genius."
Of all the cultural activities indulged in by youth, music
certainly comes first. This no doubt is due to the fact
that music offers teen-agers the best means of following
the development of human expression across the span of
time and of appreciating its boundless diversity across the
length and breadth of our planet.
Then, too and this is perhaps most important of all
young people find that music (especially modern music)
expresses their state of mind perfectly, ranging as it does
from feelings of tenderness all the way to violence, and
reflecting the feverish rhythm of their lives.
One movement, called the Jeunesses Musicales, has been
particularly effective in introducing teen-agers to the great
masterpieces of music. It has been even more effective,
no doubt, in giving young musicians a chance to practise
and perform in concerts together.
One sequence from a recent film on a Jeunesses Musi¬
cales camp in Canada shows a quartet giving a magnificent
performance in a forest clearing, and an orchestra made
up of musicians all under twenty executing an allegro under
the baton of their teen-age maestro, while the seasoned
conductor looks on.
HEN, of course, there are the cinema clubs
all over the world which give teen-agers a
chance to learn from other teen-agers how to interpret
and understand the moving frames of pictures, just as
others are taught to analyse the scripts.
I^ere again there is a tendency to switch from the study
of film appreciation to actual film production. This is
certainly the best way for youngsters to learn the art and
technique of film making, and also an excellent means of
discovering and appreciating the world around us.
Not long ago, for instance, the students of the Hosei
Cinema Club in Japan spent twelve days shooting a film
on a Japanese village at work. Belgian experiments have
shown that even the youngest teen-agers are capable of mak¬
ing films, and many have indeed been produced in various
countries. One outstanding example is a 16mm. film entitled
"Wednesday Afternoon" produced by six boys and two girls
between the ages of eleven and fourteen.
If such creative arts as painting and sculpture do not
yet occupy the place they deserve in youth circles, handi¬
crafts, and especially canework and pottery, are very
popular.
These activities and to a greater extent the theatre, danc¬
ing and singing are now taking on extraordinary importance
for youth in Africa and Asia as well as Latin America. It
is through the arts that respect for true national cultures
can be reborn and remoulded, and the crushing effect of
years of foreign influence counteracted. The young gene¬
ration is thus proving to be the chief agent for cultural
development, which is as necessary for a nation as economic
and social development.
Time and again, youth has also turned out to be the
new organizer of community life. Yugoslavia is an admirable
case in point. Yugoslav youngsters have arranged local,
regional and national festivals; they have introduced new
types of entertainment of high quality, and have sparked

Dedicated to the
pursuit of knowledge
interest in forms of music, dancing and theatre which are
a far cry from the run-of-the-mill folklore performances one
is accustomed to.
What is most striking when we watch these performances,
which demonstrate the artistic vitality of youth in all its
diversity, is the high quality of the productions themselves.
This is sufficient commentary on the taste and intelligence,
the attention and zeal young people give to their work.
We are a long way, indeed, from the amateurish bungling
of not many years ago. What magnificent, heart-warming
spectacles the great youth festivals of today have become!
Is there any better way for young people to compare and
admire the contributions of different countries to the
world's common heritage? We should not be surprised
therefore that they are optimistic about man's future yet
are fiercely determined to prevent it from being wiped out.
HERE are other ways for young people to get
a clearer and more accurate idea of all that
man has achieved. Most of them search eagerly for every
kind of knowledge that can lead to better understanding
of a world now launched into the age of atomic energy
and space exploration. We can no longer doubt this after
glancing through the magazines and periodicals of youth
organizations and seeing the range of activities and interests
they encompass, from agrarian reform and the peaceful
uses of the atom to the latest jazz recordings. The
congresses and study groups of these organizations mostly
of an international order which fill the universities at
vacation times are assemblies which give youth an oppor¬
tunity to hear about and to discuss some of the major
problems of our time.
We have only to take a look at the daily life of almost
any community to find young people setting up clubs dedi¬
cated to the pursuit of knowledge. Sometimes they have
to make do with improvised meeting places, maybe even
the shed housing the local fire-fighting equipment, though
more often nowadays their club rooms are modern and
well-equipped.
It would, of course, be impossible to present here a com¬
plete picture of all the activities within the scope and interest
of youth clubs, but we can at least single out those currently
enjoying the greatest popularity.
In a world where roles of science and technology are
increasingly preponderant it is hardly surprising that young¬
sters want to learn all they can about these subjects, and
that more and more are attracted by scientific and technical
courses. No one will be astonished to hear that there are
science clubs in big cities such as Moscow, Pittsburg, Mar¬
seilles and Yokohama; more surprising and encouraging
is the fact that places like Douala and Dakar in Africa now
also have active science clubs.
Young botanists poring over dusty collections of dried
plants have become almost "prehistoric" figures. In their
place youthful aerospace technicians launch rockets which
carry mice to heights of 3,000 metres or more, confidently
make in-flight measurements of altitudes attained, and of
trajectories and speeds of acceleration, and at the same
time study the reactions of the living organisms used in the
experiments. This is the actual programme of a club in
Bordeaux, France, whose members also include young

I N 1907, a young German
school-teacher in the Ruhr
was making plans to get children away
from the smoke and noise of the city
and to let them taste the healthy
pleasures of the open countryside.
Outings don't cost much when you set
off on foot carrying a rucksack. But
what about accommodation? The teach¬
er, Richard Schirrmann, solved the
problem by turning his little school at
Altena into a dormitory at holiday
times. Four years later he arranged
part of an old castle as a place for
meetings and relaxation. It became
the world's first youth hostel a
modest start of a great adventure.
Today a network of youth hostels
covers 62 countries in all five conti¬
nents.
By 1930 there were already 2,000
hostels in Germany, and two years
later the first international meeting of
youth hostel organizers from 1 1 Eu
ropean countries was held in Ams¬
terdam.
The hostels which Richard Schirr¬
mann had intended for school children
quickly opened their doors to young
people of all ages and social groups,
to students and workers of all coun¬
tries. Unanimous agreement at the
Amsterdam meeting established a prin¬
ciple later to be incorporated in the
statutes of the International Youth
Hostel Federation that there should
be no barriers raised nor distinctions
drawn for reasons of race, religion,
colour or class.
After 1945 youth hostels were
opened in African and Asian countries.
From India to Japan and from Egypt to
Thailand, more and more youth hostels
applied to join the International Fede¬
ration (created in 1946). The world
total of individual members increases
all the time; it rose from 1,609,000 in
1963 to 1,670,000 in 1964.
The number of beds available is also
growing: from 245,700 in 1963 to
250,000 in 1964. In India there is still
only one youth hosteller per 148,000
inhabitants, but in Austria the ratio is
one to 47, and in Sweden one to 67.
This summer the 18th International
Youth Hostellers' Rally is being held
in Cracow, Poland. Here members
will meet hostellers from all parts of
the world and enjoy a programme of
singing, folk-dancing and camp-fire
celebrations.

AN EXPLOSION OF VITALITY (Cont'd)
Uniting beneath the emblem of Unesco
meteorologists and aerial photographers. Other clubs
which now span the world carry out projects ranging from
chemistry and natural history to physics and biology.
These young amateur scientists are always eager to meet
their counterparts in other countries and to compare ideas
and carry out joint projects. The Fourth International Scien¬
tific Camp for Youth held in the Hautes Fagnes, Belgium,
was a typical enterprise of this kind. Young people from
eight countries followed concentrated research programmes
that included archaeological excavations, geomorphology,
human geography, studies of local plants and investigations
of living creatures in rivers and streams.
England's Scientific Fortnights, which are held periodic¬
ally, have proved outstandingly successful. Young people
lucky enough to take part hear talks by top-level scientists,
visit ultra-modern laboratories and exchange experiences
and ideas.
The "Science Service" in the U.S.A., which has greatly
expanded in recent years, is another organization that stimu¬
lates the interest and participation of youth in scientific
activities. It supplies them with simple and inexpensive
equipment, and has a subscription service which provides a
monthly package of experimental materials for carrying out
a specially-designed educational programme. Youngsters
are even shown how to manufacture nylon. One sees the
results of such initiatives at the fascinating U.S. "science
fairs" where young people display the practical results of
their work and give original demonstrations.
Two aspects of these activities are noteworthy. Firstly
they enable young people to work closely with their teachers
or with scientists of standing. It is by no means rare for
leading scientists to actually collaborate with the young¬
sters, and this is especially true of the U.S.S.R. where the
Pioneer youth centres have all kinds of workshops and
laboratories. Coupled with this the clubs often help young
people to make up their minds about choosing science as a
career and to have a clear idea which branch to enter.
In other words all clubs of this type play a significant part
in guiding young people to a career and provide them with
pre-vocational training. Yugoslavia's voluntary work team
organization does not offer laboratory facilities, but as its
members build roads and railways they also learn how to
drive trucks and to dismantle and repair engines.
I
14
F we were to try to mention even a part of all
the efforts now being made by youth organiza¬
tions to provide vocational training where indeed would
we stop on our round-the-world tour? The list is far too
long. Why choose the school work-sites of Senegal in
preference to those of the Singapore Labour Brigade?
Why select the young farmers' clubs in the Indian state of
Mysore rather than the 4H Clubs of Minnesota in the
United States? Why refer to a young miners' group in
Japan instead of a young German metal-workers' group in
the Ruhr? Are the secretarial courses of the Young
Women's Christian Association more deserving of attention
than the agricultural training groups for young Catholic
women in Latin America?
Like the Young Pioneers Centre in Accra, where Ghana's
future mechanics, radio-electricians, refrigeration engineers
and bridge builders are learning and working, all these
groups deserve equal mention for the work they are doing.
So let us turn to Europe and visit one of the Unesco Clubs
somewhere in the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Spain
or France (though we could also visit one in Japan, Argen¬
tina or Madagascar if we so wished).
First of all, what is a Unesco Club and why are hundreds
of the clubs now active in nearly a score of countries? The
answer is that all over the world young people would like
to learn about and to understand the ideas, the work and
the ways of life of people in other countries; they also
want to know about their own countries' problems and
about major world problems. All these young people can
come together beneath the emblem of Unesco.
In any of the clubs we might visit in Europe we would
probably find young people listening to a university pro¬
fessor talking about the economic, social and political prob¬
lems of Ceylon, or perhaps a writer describing a recent
visit to Africa, or even one of their club members speaking
about racialism. On another day they may be receiving
a visit from Iranian students or arranging to set off for
Finland, and preparing to record the visit on colour slides
so that it will help contribute to international understanding
when later shown to their local community. Some may
even be planning to produce a little book on Finnish life
and customs that can be sold to raise money for Unesco
Gift Coupons.
TUDY groups and international relations clubs
'as well as sections of the Students International
United Nations Movement which exist in many countries
pursue programmes no less active and valuable. In Nigeria,
for instance, the U.N. Association publishes a periodical
which is now read by young people all over Africa; from
the United Kingdom association members have gone out
to the developing countries to render worth-while services.
How true it is that the spontaneous, warm-hearted desire
of youth to help others can only develop and be put to
practical use when combined with the power of knowledge
and practical skills.
The urge to help, the acquisition of knowledge and skills,
an early maturity and a consciousness of their personal
involvement with a changing world all prompt certain young
people to take an active part in community affairs. It is
often said that those who are indifferent or who are ready
to accept things as they are by far outnumber the dynamic
spearhead of active youth. Others accuse young people
who seek an active place in community life of confusing
action with agitation. Whether they denounce youth for
its apathy or for its agitation, both kinds of critics seem to
forget that these shortcomings are more often than not
provoked by the situation in which young people find them¬
selves and conditions under which they live.
In the developing countries many young people are con¬
demned to idleness; elsewhere outmoded traditions allow
illiterate fathers to dominate their educated children and
also keep engineers of 1920 vintage in authority over impa¬
tient, go-ahead technicians of 1965. Even where liberal
attitudes help to reduce the resistance of "the man in au¬
thority", and a clearer view of things sharpens adult ideas
on what is right for the community, the doors to public life
are still but barely open to the younger generation. Yet as
we have already seen, many have nevertheless managed to
thrust their way in.
Youth movements, in any case, are in no way relaxing their
efforts to equip their members for places in civic and social
life. The valuable feature of movements like the Boy
Scouts, the Junior Red Cross, the Young Co-operators and
the Workcamp Volunteers is that they involve young people
in techniques required in community life and in giving

service to others. The activities of associations such as
the young workers' or young farmers' groups or the stu¬
dent unions are nowadays increasingly associated with
trade union matters.
What is especially striking is that as they are confronted
with a fast-developing world and new and demanding tasks,
all these youth organizations are tending to expand the
scope of their work and to associate more closely with
each other: educational movements now concern themselves
with politics, political groups launch recreational and
cultural programmes; students are one day defending their
rights and demanding university reforms and the next,
staging a play or going out to help refurbish dilapidated
homes in a slum area.
Young people are nowadays much more inclined than
hitherto to join forces and to send their representatives
to meet in co-ordination committees or youth councils.
They are, of course, looking after their own affairs, but
they are also prepared to go much further and to intervene
in national affairs if they feel that the immediate or long-
term interests of youth are at stake. In many cases they
have official relations with local and national authorities,
and outcries that once rose unheeded in the wilderness
have become the moderate and reasoned voices of
consultation.
Better still, they may even administer certain activities
within their sphere of interest in co-operation with the
authorities. Under a co-management system in France,
for instance, youth groups and administrative bodies are
equally represented on the organization that arranges travel
abroad and voluntary work camps. Equally important work
is done by the World University Service organization.
Grouped in its national branches, students, professors and
administrators are responsible for setting up and operating

AN EXPLOSION OF VITALITY (Cont'd)
Not unlike a new Renaissance

university housing complexes and restaurants, student wel¬
fare centres and sanatoria and for the co-operative publi¬
cation of mimeographed lectures and manuals.
This sampling of some relatively well-developed civic
and social institutions should not lead us to overlook the
many transformations now taking place in newly-developing
countries, right down to villages in the bush. One could
quote thousands of examples of changes similar to those
brought about by the agricultural youth group in the Akoupé
region of the Ivory Coast. There, the young people suggest¬
ed to the village chieftains that the traditional period of
mourning should be reduced, and also proposed changes
in the dowry system and the system of matrilinear inheri¬
tance. Lively but courteous discussions finally convinced
the village elders that the requests were reasonable and
the local customs were changed accordingly.
There are those who view the ebullience of modern
youth with alarm. But we have no reason to regret the
passing of the old civic lessons which taught rigid obedience
to existing laws. Young people have now affirmed that
they want a dynamic civic code, not a static one. And
they will be ready to serve their country and its institutions
to the extent that they are allowed to share in developing
those institutions.
The services which young people render to the community
are described elsewhere in this issue. But one example
which should perhaps be mentioned here is the Junior Red
Cross. All over the world its members give first aid,
brighten up houses and clean schools, help to improve
diets and build public baths, wage war against mosquitoes
and make sandals to protect people against hookworm.
And to round out this picture of the civic and social work
done by young people, a place of honour should go to
the Scouts of Nigeria who, in co-operation with a team
from the World Health Organization and the International
Children's Fund, have been on health patrols all over
their country. They have been trained to recognize the
symptoms of diseases like scabies and smallpox, and in
three years they have examined 140,000 cases and vaccinat¬
ed 86% of the people against smallpox.
S we have already seen, a significantly large
proportion of young people is deeply interested
in knowing more about the ways of life, the customs and
cultures of other countries and about international events,
trends and problems. The ways they have found to
integrate themselves with the movement for international
friendship that now spans the world are widely know: pen
friendships and an exchange of materials of all kinds,
travel abroad, international meetings and assemblies,
invitations to youngsters from other countries to spend
holidays with them, international voluntary workcamps,
voluntary aid campaigns and so on.
It is chiefly because of material obstacles that such
activities are still limited to a relatively small though
constantly increasing number of young people. Many
others would or could readily join in. We realize this
when we look a little more closely at the more or less
basic and more or less conscious reasons which urge young
people to cross frontiers, to build friendships with young¬
sters of other countries and other races, and to act as
ambassadors of international co-operation.
To these youngsters, newspapers, films, radio and tele¬
vision are like travel folders, beckoning them to make
new discoveries and to enjoy new experiences, though
these are folders of a far more appealing kind than the
ones issued by tourist agencies. It is these sources, far
more than schoolbooks, which stir their imagination and
fill them with intriguing ideas about the world. And this
leads them to take up studies and discussions and to set
off on real or imaginary journeys.
Some people will maintain that this is mere escapism,
and there is no denying that many young people are only
too happy to find a reasonable pretext for turning their
backs on everyday existence and escaping from their
immediate responsibilities. But it is no less certain that
this is a natural human trait and though it should be
guarded against there is no great cause to worry when it
is inspired by the right cause.
EXPLORING even more deeply, we may uncover
other motives. And one of them may well be
the keen curiosity felt by all young people as they
contemplate a world undergoing revolutionary transforma¬
tions, an age, which as I said at the start, is not unlike a
new Renaissance. The things that amaze one always
stand out more sharply against an alien background than
when seen in familiar surroundings.
But as they discover the exciting new world of today,
the young see things which shock them. How is it, they
ask, if man possesses powers approaching the mira¬
culous, that hunger, poverty and ignorance still prevail
over vast areas of the globe? They demand that something
be done; they no longer believe that such ills are incurable.
They have no reasons for resignation since they know
that technological resources exist and that international
aid is constantly expanding. That is why they believe in
international co-operation and why they insist with vigour
and confidence in playing their part.
When the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
appealed to youth to join forces in helping the developing
countries and in working for the eradication of hunger
and sickness throughout the world, there was an immediate
and spontaneous reaction from youth organizations in most
countries. Here indeed was a striking example of youth's
confidence and vigour. These young people saw that it was
not a question of collecting money or food, but rather of
providing their comrades in the developing countries with
the specialist advice and equipment that are needed to
transform standards of living.
In a world so rich in resources and so full of opportunities,
youth believes that everything possible must be done to
ensure the peaceful progress of mankind and the pre¬
servation of its achievements from senseless annihilation.
This is why so many young people today are crusading for
international understanding and the peaceful settlement of
differences throughout the world.
We have tried to show that a great many young people
those, in fact, who will one day conduct their countries'
affairs are already carrying out all kinds of responsible
and worthwhile tasks. They deserve our entire trust and
confidence. We have also tried to convey the feelings
of thousands upon thousands of youngsters calm and
thoughtful, eager and energetic alike who declare impa¬
tiently: "We too want to play our part..."

OPERATION 'COMMUNITY SERVICE' (Cont'd)
Coming to grips with realities
they organize and carry out without receiving any remu¬
neration. And they are by no means the only ones in Peru
to spend their leisure time in this way. Distributed among
150 villages, 800 university students are endeavouring to
introduce new ideas and practices in the villages and to
help the people raise their standard of living.
This movement of young volunteers is now universal
and its members can be found working enthusiastically
in other South American countries. In Peru it was launched
two years ago when an educated section of the population
young people, and therefore the most generous-minded
and idealistic turned to another social group the most
underprivileged members of the community with the idea
of making friendly and helpful contacts.
It was the students who took the initiative in trying to get
into direct touch with social realities, to discover for them¬
selves the most urgent needs of the people, and to do so
before the time-filling routine of their professional work
cut them off, in most cases, from the possibility of acquir¬
ing such experience.
Throughout almost all of Latin America, the university,
as an institution, has become separated from everyday
life. Except for their political views (which in any case are
nearly always coloured by world problems and events),
students in Latin America have been living on the fringe
of the social reality surrounding them. Many graduate
with distinction from their universities, but their ideas on
the role they may eventually have to play in the community
are far from clear.
In countries where economic and cultural inequalities have
existed for centuries, it is not just a gap which separates
the university from everyday life, but a gulf.
Yet to attain the level of industrially-developed nations
the top priority goal for the Latin American continent
such countries urgently need the services of professional
men and women and technicians of all kinds qualified to
contribute to every stage of development; no less urgent
is the need for auxiliary personnel to work in the most
isolated and neglected communities, mobilizing the energies
of the people, making them feel the need for progress and
convincing them that it can be achieved. Dynamic efforts
are required for such a task. The idea that universities
should give an impetus to this enterprise was one shared
by the Peruvian government.
Towards the end of 1963, President Belaunde called on
Peru's university students to spend two months of their
next vacation in the country's isolated villages, and to help
revive the ancient Peruvian tradition of co-operative public
works. A thousand students at once answered the presi¬
dent's appeal and their response brought into being the
new form of work movement called "Cooperación Popular
Universitaria" (University Community Co-operation).
In 1964 the volunteers who joined this movement went
out into 120 communities. This year, 200 villages were
visited by 1,200 students who were joined for the first
time by 15 European volunteers and by 15 members of the
U.S. Peace Corps.
Their work could hardly have been more varied. Ranging
from community organization to legal advice (especially on
land disputes) their occupations included talks on agricul¬
ture, animal care, hygiene, co-operatives, agrarian reform,
home economics and public administration; they gave
lessons in reading and writing, reviewed school work, orga¬
nized sports and cultural centres and opened libraries;
they helped to build roads, reservoirs, latrines, school
buildings and markets; some gave first aid or dental care;
others prepared plans for social and economic research.
All this work was geared to the particular needs and avail¬
able resources of each community.
To prepare them for the work of "community develop¬
ment", students were given training and guidance by the
Foundation for International Development. From the
volunteer workers, small villages learned that they must
try to solve their problems by their own efforts, and that
if certain resources are missing then it is up to them
to put pressure on the authorities to provide what is
needed. This first step on the road to progress, which
gives students and villagers the incentive to live and work
together, sums up the aim of the programme: to awaken
a community spirit and a determination to succeed.
One of the most worth-while results of the University

OPERATION 'COMMUNITY SERVICE' (Cont'd)
'Come back
next year'
Community Co-operation programme is the practical expe¬
rience of real-life situations it offers to Peruvian students
as it does to those taking part in similar programmes
in other countries. This is just as important for these
young people, who need this experience before entering
professional life, as it is for the village people who need
to lose the feeling that they are isolated and neglected.
The influence on the students is strikingly revealed by
a comparison between their views as candidates for
the work and their changed ideas after spending two
months in the villages. Vague and high-flown concepts
about the future of their country have been replaced by
down-to-earth ideas about how they can use their profes¬
sional knowledge to contribute to national development.
The effect of these experiences is not only felt by the
individual students; it has made a collective impact through¬
out the universities. While the Catholic University has
been launching a literacy teaching programme and setting
up new work camps, the Peruvian University of Medical
and Biological Sciences has been exchanging ideas with
leaders of the University Community Co-operation pro¬
gramme regarding an "interne" period in the isolated
villages for newly-qualified doctors and surgeons.
Nor do the student-villager contacts, or "communeros"
as they are called, cease when the two-month visit is
over. During this association many strong human ties are
formed. Letters are exchanged and hundreds of demands
flow into the central office of the movement in Lima and
into its provincial branches, asking students to return on
their next vacation or requesting volunteer groups to add
new villages to their lists.
ODAY a third university programme is being
prepared in which two thousand volunteers will
take part. Apart from a few changes dictated by expe¬
rience, this new programme will follow the general lines of
the first one. Two years' experience have shown that it
takes more than a few months to consolidate the social
work undertaken by the University Community Co-operation
movement. The presence of students and professional men
in the villages and the work they do there needs to have
a more permanent form. It is planned to achieve this
continuity by transforming the work of the university move¬
ment into a continuing rural programme for volunteer
workers.
As a start fifty students will be sent to three localities
Puno, Sicuani and Urubamba in southern Peru where
their work will be co-ordinated by the provincial offices
of the movement. These students include twenty from
Europe, who have been taking part in the university sum¬
mer programme to familiarize themselves with local prob¬
lems, and twelve from the Peace Corps. All fifty students
have university degrees in one of the following subjects:
sociology, economics, social welfare, engineering, architec¬
ture, agronomy and pedagogy.
The sceptics who declared that this volunteer movement
could never be kept going have been disproved once and
for all. It is very much a going concern, carried forward
by the enthusiasm of volunteers for whom the initial
idea of co-operation between student and villager has
now become a vocation.

than 40 acres of ruins, ancient walls and underground passages.

10,000 YOUNGSTERS
TO THE RESCUE
During the past ten years 1 0,000 young people students, apprentices
and workers from France and other countrieshave spent their
weekends helping to save an ancient chateau in the north of France.
Crumbling and abandoned, the 1,000-year old Chateau de Guise
seemed doomed to destruction. In 1 954, a young villager from Guise,
Maurice Duton, aged 25, decided to do something about rescuing
the chateau. Setting up a group he called "Le Club du Vieux Manoir"
(The Old Manor Club), he quickly recruited teams of volunteer
workers. Today the Chateau de Guise has regained its former
majestic appearance. Over 8,000 people visited it last year. But
Maurice Duton (right, with some of his young helpers) is still not

ONE WINNER
TWO VICTORIES
IIT is not often that a
sportsman is awarded a
trophy when he loses a contest. But
on May 20, 1965, Eugenio Monti, the
Italian bobsleigh champion was pre¬
sented by Mr. René Maheu, Director-
General of Unesco, with the first Inter¬
national Fair Play Trophy, not for
winning a race, but because he lost it.
Monti's defeat was more significant
than a victory; it was an outstanding
example of the spirit of fair play which
is the finest lesson that sport can
teach.
During the 1964 Olympic Winter
Games at Innsbruck (Austria), Monti
made his last bobsleigh run at a speed
that most people thought would bring
him victory. Then he learned that the
British bobsleigh team, Tony Nash and
Robin Dixon, were in trouble because
of a broken part on their sleigh.
Without hesitation Monti removed the
part from his sleigh and gave it to the
British team. They repaired their own
sleigh, made a record run . . . and won
the Olympic gold medal.
Presenting the trophy to Eugenio
Monti, Mr. Maheu stressed the rela¬
tionship between the spirit of sports¬
manship and the values that Unesco
seeks to promote.
Fair play, he said, is above all a
spirit of loyalty. This quality may well
come from an inborn trait but also
needs to be developed, and that is the
role of education. Fair play also implies
a concern for equal opportunities, and
Eugenio Mojiti displayed that concern

by correcting an accidental inequality
so that others could compete on a
equal footing, that is to say objectively.
And what else is objectivity but the
scientific attitude of mind?, asked
Mr. Maheu. Lastly, fair play exalts
the intrinsic worth of an unselfish act
which is the hallmark of true culture.
The award was made to Eugenio
Monti by the "Pierre de Coubertin"
International Organizing Committee for
Fair Play Trophies (Pierre de Coubertin
was the founder of the modern Olympic
Games). This committee is composed
of representatives of Unesco, of the
International Sporting Press Associa¬
tion, of the International Council of
Physical Education and Sport and lead¬
ing international sports federations.
On being presented with his trophy,
Eugenio Monti said he believed that
the International Fair Play Trophy
would become "the world's most covet¬
ed award."

An almost unlimited need
for junior volunteers
young people are employed during the
summer or hold down part-time jobs
while at school, but it is estimated that
well over 50 per cent of American's
college and university students have
some kind of job either on or off the
campus.
NLY recently the U.S.
Government announced a
nationwide work-study programme
which will provide summer jobs for
nearly 40,000 American college stu¬
dents from low-income families. The
U.S. Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare described the programme
as a significant contribution to the
youth opportunity campaign launched
in May 1965 to aid 500,000 teen-agers
to obtain summer employment.
Summer occupations for young peo¬
ple may include working as gardeners,
playground supervisors, lifeguards at
swimming pools and so on. Other,
more enterprising projects are set up
by groups who make . and sell small
items of practical use such as memo¬
randum pads, costume jewellery and
stationery.
Today some 94,000 U.S. teen-agers
are learning by actual experience the
techniques of manufacturing and sell¬
ing products. Helped by local busi¬
nessmen, who explain basic principles
of production and salesmanship, secon¬
dary school students organize, finance
and run small businesses of their own.
Their activities are guided by a nation¬
wide non-profit organization which
encourages after-school projects to
teach youngsters how business sys¬
tems work.
I ARALLELING the desire to
earn money is the urge to
contribute to the welfare of the com¬
munity around them. Encouraged by
fathers who act as Boy Scout troop
leaders and mothers who work in
Parent-Teacher organizations, young
people take on chores which have as
a reward a feeling of personal satis¬
faction in addition to giving practical
experience and developing self-confi¬
dence.
All over the United States teen-agers
are working as junior volunteers to
help others. The opportunities and
the need for junior volunteers are
practically unlimited. Each summer
thousands of Junior Red Cross volun¬
teers work for several days a week
in hundreds of hospitals, recreation
centres and other agencies. Many
teen-age Red Cross volunteers proudly
wear the badge they have earned by
contributing 500 hours' service.
Other ways in which young Ameri¬
cans serve in the Red Cross are as
first aid instructors, and in small craft
and water safety and emergency dis¬
aster training. Within one twelve¬
month period, American Red Cross
training courses were completed by
927,000 school children and college
students.
Along with the Red Cross, Boy
Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire Girls and
organizations connected with the
Young Men's and Young Women's
Christian Associations are especially
active in serving the underprivileged,
the sick and the aged.
I N many cities young
people work in after-school
centres run by youth councils which
offer local children a chance to expe¬
riment in art, drama and music. Other
volunteers serve as club leaders and
librarians, coach in athletics and tutor
youngsters who need help with their
school work.
These young volunteers may be just
as poor and face just as many prob¬
lems as do the children they are
trying to help, but they have decided
that this is the way to make things
different and better.
Other groups sponsor summer
camps for underprivileged children,
staffed in part by young volunteer
counselors. Many high school civics
classes have as part of the course a
community service project.
In 1831 a brilliant young French
writer, Alexis de Tocqueville, crossed
the Atlantic to take a look at demo¬
cracy in the New World. One pene¬
trating observation he made in his
famous work, "Democracy in America,"
aptly explains what so many young
Americans are doing today.
De Tocqueville wrote that amongst
democratic nations no citizen could
oblige his fellow-men to lend him their
assistance and that if they did not
learn voluntarily to help each other
civilization itself would be endangered.

ODAY more than 17,000
powerful young swimmers
keep Australia's beaches safe. They
make up one of the world's greatest
voluntary lifesaving organizations the
Surf Life Saving Association of Aus¬
tralia.
On a patrolled beach in Australia
people have a maximum guarantee of
safety... thanks to the lifesavers, the
men responsible for seeing the swim¬
mer's appetite for surf, sun and sand
is safely and fully satisfied.
The beach livesavers can look back
on a 57-year-old record whose most
impressive statistics are that more than
140,000 people have been rescued and
that the number of drownings has been
negligible.
The remarkable record of the surf
lifesavers has been achieved by a
combination of their own swimming
ability, the belt and lifeline, the surf
boat and the surf ski.
These young men compete in regu¬
lar surf carnivals which are major
events on the Australian sporting
calendar. With the surf boats crashing
through a turbulent sea, the beltmen
battling the surf, the precision march¬
ing as the club teams compete in the
"grand parade", the surf carnival is a
colourful spectacle.
Each of the hundreds who take part
proudly wears his bronze medallion
the surf lifesaver's badge of profi¬
ciency acquired only after hard train¬
ing developed by teams of experts
over the last half century and designed
to make the lifesaver proficient in all
phases of rescue, first aid and artifi¬
cial respiration.
These young men give up their
leisure time and even pay subscrip¬
tions for the privilege of belonging to
one of the surf lifesaving clubs. The
only rewards they seek are in competi¬
tion between themselves at the spec¬
tacular surf carnivals when there is
keen rivalry between the clubs in the
team events. These consist of the
drills used in actual rescues.
One of the most thrilling sights in
these competitions is the surf boat
crews battling their way through the
wildest surf. As the boat races shore-
wards, its five-man crew crowded at
the stern lifts the nose so that it slices
through the breakers. Balanced pre¬
cariously on the end is the powerful
"sweep" who needs superb timing
and judgement to steer the craft.

Young people have a vast potential of hidden
creative talents which with a little encouragement
quickly develop and produce striking results.
One example is seen in the remarkable modern
tapestries woven by teen-age artists from Egypt
reproduced in full colour and black and white on
the following pages. The "Pygmalion" in this case
was an Egyptian architect, Mr. Rameses Wissa
Wassef, who set up a weaving workshop in a
village near Oairo. Below he describes the
artistic development of the young villagers over
the years. An exhibition of their tapestries was
held this year at the Louvre's Musée des Arts
Décoratifs in Paris. Many other exhibitions of
these works have been held: Paris (1956), Swit¬
zerland (1958), Sweden and Denmark (I960),
Netherlands (1960 and 1963) and the Federal
Republic of Germany (1962).

A POETIC WORLD FASHIONED
ON THE WEAVER'S LOOM
BOUT twenty years ago I decided to teach the
young people of a small community school in
the suburbs of Cairo how to weave tapestries. What I had
in mind was much more a human experiment than a pedago¬
gical project. All these youngsters came from very
poor families and had never had any kind of education in
art. By teaching them to weave, I was sure that 1 would
encourage them to use the creative talents that are latent
in all young people, simply waiting to find an outlet. The
results were so remarkable that 1 decided to continue the
experiment at Harrania, a little village just outside Cairo.
At Harrania I assembled a group of youngsters hap¬
hazardly. They had no special aptitudes, apart from their
youth and their desire to work. They were free to come to
the workshop whenever they wished, outside school hours,
of course.
Today all these young people without exception are capa¬
ble of creating directly on the loom, without the help of
any sketch, tapestries of a beauty that has impressed
visitors to a great many European galleries of modem art.
including recently the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris.
I am convinced that this experiment, if it is properly
appreciated and the right conclusions are drawn from it,
deserves to be repeated on a far wider scale. It offers
simple, natural and effective solutions for a great many
problems, social and individual alike. Its innovation con¬
sisted in combining art, education, social life, craftsmanship
and wage-earning in a single activity that allowed complete
freedom of expression.
People who see these tapestries always ask two ques¬
tions: "How do these young people succeed in weaving,
without preliminary sketches, scenes which are often com¬
plex but always well balanced?" and "What induced you to
try out this experiment?"
I can answer the second question immediately by saying
that I always had the feeling that I could have done the same
as these youngsters if the opportunity had been offered me

Colour and harmony
in time and, furthermore, that in my view the reproduction
of a drawing on a loom is not really a work of tapestry
creation; it is a fruitless activity and wrong approach.
To reply to the first question is more difficult. Just watch
a youngster who has been given drawing materials. He
doesn't ask you what he must do. Without hesitation, he
begins to depict people, animals, plants, etc. It is his own
intimate language, full of warmth and expression, and he
gives himself up entirely to it. This language is universal.
To criticize such drawings because of their lack of
perspective or their inaccuracy or even merely to say "be
more observant" would destroy the youngster's wish to
express himself by drawing. What interests me is to try
to perpetuate the act of expression and to lead the young
person to go on drawing as an unself-conscious habit.
Everything that is expressed afterwards starts from here.
Instead of giving the boys and girls pencil and paper,
I introduced them immediately to weaving. For some time,
I let them struggle with the network of threads on the loom.
They began by trying, thread by thread, to depict the ¡mage
in which they were interested, and once it had assumed a
shape, however embryonic, the battle was won. Very soon
their fingers were weaving a steady flow of pictures.
Years of work and experience did the rest. The complicated
scenes which they have depicted day after day since then
represent everything they have experienced; it is just as if
they were writing the story of their own lives.
All young people have an innate sense of colour, har¬
mony, balance, rhythm and movement, and the pictures
they make are based on geometrical and architectural
figures of great clarity and strength. Nature has given them
a creative power which, once set free, never ceases to
amaze us. Unfortunately, all these gifts, latent and hesitant
when adults are present, are neglected by most teachers.
Even those who sense this fact are apt to complain regret¬
fully that after the age of twelve nothing spontaneous can
be expected from a child. Whose fault is this?
I have often been asked why I chose weaving for my
Harrania experiment. Before explaining my reasons I should
like to mention that we intend to enrol new groups of young
people to work with other materials. We have already
begun with pottery and the construction of vaulted roofs
with dried mud bricks, for which we have no need to buy
materials. We shall also add woodwork, glass, enamels,
printing on cloth, and speech training. We hope that all
these activities will complement each other and generate
sufficient energy to transform the entire life and culture of
the village.
Tapestry seemed to me to be admirably suited for my
first experiment since it combines two extremely well-
balanced forces, namely ¡mage and technique.
The image is the mirror of the intellect. Consequently,
the whole inner life of the young person ¡s freely
expressed and controls the form the work will take.
Technique is the effort made by the body itself, domi¬
nated and disciplined by the mind. It develops parallel
with the progress of the work.

A POETIC WORLD (Cont'd)
's young artist-craftsmen
Therefore, tapestry contains everything necessary to
enable a youngster to use simultaneously his skill and his
imagination to the full.
At the beginning weaving is a difficult and slow process,
and that is why young people become passionately inte¬
rested by it. Many months go by before it can be perform¬
ed satisfactorily, but every tiny achievement is a triumph.
By comparison it is easy to understand that drawing on
paper fails to absorb a youngster who composes a picture in
a few minutes and then loses interest immediately.
Studying the development of tapestry work over many
years, I was able to distinguish a number of important
stages. In the first few months, the subjects are rudimen¬
tary. Animals' paws or tree trunks are like pillars supporting
a mass in which one can just distinguish a few signs
revealing an intention to differentiate between them. Later,
these distinctive signs become more pronounced and varied
every day. Then for a fairly long period, the existence of
unconscious forms and movements can be detected; these
are the precursors of conscious design and are just as
important for the final whole as for the structure of every
detail. In other words, birds, plants, men and trees have
very similar and almost interchangeable shapes. Often
these shapes appear in a pure form free of any embellish¬
ment and reminiscent of abstract art. I should point out
that, when weaving, the artist sees only a small part of his
work and often works in a lateral direction.
Later, these forms become more flexible and lead to a
more vivid picture based on actual impressions. Some¬
times, the artist tends to exaggerate the characteristics of
the object or scene he wishes to depict. This might
be called an expressionist trend and the scenes depicted
are narrative or descriptive. Sometimes, he puts together
a few motifs inspired by poetic feeling or pure fancy.
In some cases, maturity leads to realism and observation,
while in others the scenes depicted are mere reconstruc¬
tions. However, in every case, the picture is embellished
as experience grows. The works are constantly renewed,
without repetition and without fatigue.
The many similarities with past and present works of art
are never due to direct influence; these young artists have
never seen any work of art outside their own workshop.
No difference of aptitude has been observed between boys
and girls, and their work is indistinguishable.
FROM the day we began work in Harrania, girls
immediately realized the advantages that this
work might represent for them and enrolled in large num¬
bers. Boys, however, showed less patience with the loom
and did not take it seriously át first. This attitude changed
on the day that Ali, a little boy aged eight, the brother of one
of our girls, found an irresistible way of gaining admission
to the workshop, which made me change my decision to
limit the number of children to those I had already enrolled.
Ali used to wander around the workshop watching what
was going on. One day, he came to show me a tiny
tapestry woven with discarded pieces of thread on a loom
he had made himself out of old planks and rusty nails.
What is the significance and value of craftsmanship for
our era? Recently, I received two letters on the subject,
one from the U.S.A. and the other from the U.S.S.R. The
publishers of a Soviet art magazine asked me for my
opinion on three questions: "Will craftsmanship and folk art
disappear in highly industrialized countries? What must be
done to protect craftsmanship traditions? Can home crafts
be described as a relic of the past, and have they a place
in modern society?"
The American letter was a report of the first International
Crafts Conference, held at New York in June 1964.
It is curious to see that the two powers in which an
industrial revolution has progressed most, although the
methods used are different, are taking an interest in crafts
in the second half of the twentieth centuryl
In a country such as Egypt, where most of the population
work in agriculture, it is clear that the practice of a craft
can offer great opportunities and lead to considerable
expansion, both cultural and material.
However, the question is obviously different in other
countries, and we should review the problem of handicrafts
as an activity and ask whether it is really a useless relic of
the past fated to disappear in an industrialized world.

N analysing this problem, let us look at the
definitions adopted by the International Crafts
Conference in New York. According to these definitions
there are three types of craftsmen: the creator, the
executor, and the person who combines both activities.
I cannot agree with this concept, which is based on an
unfortunate practice that developed in the Western world
after the Middle Ages and to which there is now a gradual
return. It recognizes two stages in a creative activity and
claims that in art conception is nobler than execution.
The artist, whether sculptor, painter or poet, is also a crafts¬
man at the moment he puts his intention into practice.
Nowadays, it is impossible for us to distinguish between
major and minor arts, pure and applied art, or figurative and
decorative art. The potter, jeweller, builder or cabinet¬
maker, who provides his work with a valid shape and a
new expression, is also an artist.
True craftsmanship can be described as the ancestor of
industry, its field of activity being that of useful and per¬
manent forms. The task of the potter, the shoemaker or
the weaver was to satisfy the need of society for useful
objects. These craftsmen interpret the tradition sensitively
and know how to adjust their work to the tastes of their
social environment. Their activities can be related to the
folk art which is integrated in social structures, sometimes
dating back thousands of years. This form of craftsmanship
will inevitably disappear both in the industrialized and non-
industrialized countries and no one can hope to save it.
There are two reasons for this disappearance. In the
first place, the modern world has broken with traditional
social structures now regarded as outmoded and, rightly
or wrongly, condemned as illogical. Secondly, it is obvious
that industrial production is depriving the craftsman of his
economic reason for existence and of his means of earning
a livelihood. Industry uses models drawn up by designers,
which give a semblance of beauty to mass production, and
the customer is satisfied!
However, even if craftsmanship is dying, art cannot die.
Consequently, we must always seek the help of art to pro¬
vide vitality to forms of craftsmanship that are still regarded
as valid, and it is therefore important to appreciate the
conditions that would promote the restoration of such
craftsmanship if we are to achieve anything. In my experi¬
ment, 1 decided to study and to carry out this task because
I regretted the disappearance, not so much of the work
produced by the craftsman, but of his living conditions, his
creative power and the methods required for his training.
If these can be restored, civilization will be the beneficiary.
The chief merit of my experiment at Harrania has been aa
to prove that it is always possible to recruit wonderful 00
craftsmen and excellent artists among the youth of even
the humblest village.

Laboratory clubs are forging ahead in France. Some
science clubs already operate and others are now. being
set up in Africa (Cameroon, Senegal), in South America
(Argentina), in Asia (China, Pakistan). They have become
outstandingly popular in Japan where young people flock to
clubs in Tokyo and other cities.
In Poland and in Yugoslavia, the standard of the science
"olympiads" has improved considerably in recent times and
the number of competitors has increased.
These are but a few random examples many other coun¬
tries could be cited but they should suffice to show the
surge of interest in science club activities in all parts of
the world.
The movement cuts across national boundaries. It is
heartening to note the valuable contacts made by young
people on the occasion of big international scientific events
olympiads, science fairs, scientific camps and the London
International Science Fortnights, among other similar
examples. Such opportunities for international exchanges
are doubtless still too few and far between, but a start
has been made. The lucky few who benefit from them are
richer in other things than scientific knowledge. It becomes
clear too that young people with scientific interests can
form a chain of friendship around the world.
After all these efforts it is reassuring to those who
sustained them wholeheartedly, believing in the educational
value of out-of-school scientific activities, to read the follow¬
ing conclusions in the Final Report of the International
Conference on Youth held by Unesco at Grenoble, France,
in 1964: "The Conference has highlighted the fact that
the modern world and modern youth require out-of-school
education to be no longer the concern only of private insti¬
tutions, but to become ever more the major preoccupation
of all who are responsible for educating young people; that
in-school and out-of-school education for young people
have an equal right to be included in plans for general
development and to receive assistance from the material
resources of the nation."
This view is bound to gain currency.
So far I have tried to show the significance of this new
impulse which sends thousands of young people to join
science clubs where they already exist and to call for
their establishment elsewhere. I should also like to
describe briefly some of the activities of these clubs,
although it is obviously not possible to give an exhaustive
account of what is being done in all countries.

Digging up history with their hands
When Swiss engineers began to widen the canal
linking the Neuchatel and Morat lakes, they discov¬
ered the remains of a Roman bridge, 80 metres long
and seven and a half metres wide. A total of 300 ancient
wooden piles (above) was discovered. The site
obviously deserved to be searched minutely but time
was limited by the programme of work on the canal.
A Swiss archaeologist, Mrs. Hanni Schwab, called on
the help of young volunteers and soon found herself
heading a team of students and schoolchildren. Camping
beside the site and cooking their own meals (left),
the young volunteers enthusiastically got to work on
what quickly became the most interesting history
lesson of their lives. They spent the days carefully
sifting the soil and the evenings cleaning, labelling and
recording (right) a variety of 2,000-year-old objects
mosaic pieces, potsherds, buckles, arms and har¬
nesses that had come to light beneath their fingers.

SCIENCE : THRILLS OF EXPLORATION (Cont'd)
From archaeology
to astronautics
of Out-of-School Scientific Activities (*) is at present mak¬
ing an inventory of science clubs.
As part of this world survey, and at the request of
Unesco's Department of Adult Education and Youth Acti¬
vities and Division of Science Teaching, the Committee
sent questionnaires to all the Unesco National Commissions.
The first reports from this enquiry brought in details of
science programmes in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Ceylon,
China, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America,
the U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia.
Contacts have since been made with El Salvador, Guate¬
mala, Ivory Coast, Iran, Pakistan, Senegal and Spain.
Various activities are under way: there are sections spe¬
cializing in such subjects as physics, chemistry, biology
and films; science camps, usually dealing with natural
sciences; seminars on physics or chemistry; courses of
lectures; visits to industrial plants; publication programmes;
science fairs; science contests or olympiads.
I should like to describe two of these activities
laboratory clubs and science camps in which
I have participated and worked with young people and
which seem to me to be particularly effective.
In France, for example, "laboratory-clubs" have been set
up in many towns, including Metz, Toulouse, Dunkirk, Mar¬
seille, Bordeaux and Pau. Reporting on its work in 1963-
1964, the Bordeaux club described activities which it had
organized under. seven sections: chemistry, biology, geo¬
logy, rockets-astronautics, astronomy, photography and
electronics.
Leaders of this club all agree that the rocket-building
programme must have an educational aim. Working as a
group, the rockets-astronautics section analyzes and dis¬
cusses its programme down to the last detail. A high stan¬
dard of work is required since all the models produced
are prototypes every part of which has been designed and
tested by these young people.
Apart from the construction and testing of rockets, the
work enables members to acquire a great deal of
knowledge. They have to make mathematical calculations,
solve problems of physics, learn about rocket fuel mixtures,
and so on. No effort is spared to make these theoretical
and experimental preparations a stimulating mental exercise
and any fruitless tinkering is studiously avoided.
The French National Centre for Space Studies has shown
(*) The I.C.I, was set up following conferences organized by the
Council of Europe at Liège (Belgium) in 1960; and by the Unesco
Youth Institute at Gauting, Munich, in 1962. These conferences
discussed problems connected with the presentation of science and
the development of out-of-school activities in science. The Secre¬
tariat was set up in Brussels (147, Chaussée de Haecht) following
two meetings in the Belgian capital (in Nov. 1962 and Nov. 1963)
sponsored by the Belgian National Commission for Unesco.

close interest in this work and says that the methods and
material are well suited to a programme designed to fami¬
liarize young people with the techniques of astronautics.
"Science Camps", set up by the French Association
Jeunes-Science since 1959, have been developed on an
even larger scale by the Belgian Jeunesses Scientifiques,
which has organized an international camp for natural
sciences every year since 1960. In July 1965, a marine bio¬
logy studies camp drew some 40 young people from nine
countries Belgium, Federal Republic of Germany, France,
Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, United Kingdom, United
States of America to Coq-sur-Mer (Belgium).
This year, too, the Council of Europe is offering six
fellowships three to adults concerned with out-of-school
scientific activities and three to young people from Italy,
Norway and Spain. It is hoped this will help to spread
the idea of science camps to other European countries,
with these six delegates acting as missionaries for the
cause.
Subjects covered by natural science camps include astro¬
nomy, botany, human geography, physical geography, geo
logy, meteorology and zoology. The predominant feature
of the camps is the sincere and keen friendship which
exists at all times between the members, between the
young and the not so young. All are inspired by the same
enthusiasm, the same belief in the value of the research
they are conducting.
S one "science camper" put it: "I was delighted
i to find how well we always got on together and
formed real bonds despite differences of nationality and
language." Another camper reported: "My main discovery
was the way we worked routine indoor work was replaced
by field work, which is far more productive. Then again,
the individualism and egoism so often found in second¬
ary schools gave way to team work. There was close
collaboration between the members of the group both in the
field and when the daily report was being written."
Doesn't this express the delight of young people who
have found their vocation, who are engaged in a quest

A PASTIME FOR EXPERTS
Photos r Holmes-Lebel, Paris
Anyone seeing the model aircraft of Tatsu Nakayama, a
young Japanese, skimming over the Bay of Tokyo might be
inclined to dismiss the flights as a pointless pastime.
But Tatsu's hobby demands ingenuity, skill and patience.
Like thousands of other youngsters he is a keen constructor
of scale model aircraft whose parts he designs and makes
himself. Finding the right design demands expert knowledge
of aerodynamics and many hours at the workbench. When
Tatsu began to devise power-driven models with unusual
shapes he spent many months in his little workshop (1)
before he managed to make one with a flying saucer shape
that performed well. Tatsu launches his flying saucer
(2, 3, 4) over the waters of Tokyo Bay during his test
flights, so that when it lands or crashes no damage is done
of self-discovery and self-appraisal helped by these inter¬
national contacts? And who are succeeding!
There is much more I would like to have written. As
it is my account is too incomplete to fully reflect the
immense possibilities of out-of-school scientific activities
for youth.
However, the world survey of science clubs being made
by the international committee in Brussels under the
sponsorship of Unesco should fill in the. gaps and reveal
the present trend of present-day out-of-school activities
in science.
Unesco is to publish a handbook on science clubs in
conjunction with the international committee on science
clubs. This will be a practical guide to the various pro¬
grammes being carried out in different parts of the world.
International contacts between young people must be
developed, firstly between neighbouring countries and then
on a global scale. Science and youth must help bring
the people of the world together, and one of the greatest
assets for this would be the creation of an International
Federation of Science Clubs, set up if possible with the
support of Unesco.
The setting up of an official body obviously does not
automatically solve all problems. But for such an
enthusiastic and vigorous movement, a co-ordinating centre
would be of great value both to the developing countries
and to those which are scientifically and technically well
equipped.
A Scientific Youth Week will be organized at the Uni¬
versal and International Canadian Exhibition to be held
in Montreal in 1967. This might indeed be an ideal
occasion for such an initiative.
I sincerely hope so. It would be a significant rendezvous
for young people from all parts of the world, confidently
aware that those of their age are ready to assume leadership
in scientific and technical research when their time comes.

TROLLERS in the Tuileries Gardens in Paris
were recently surprised to come upon a busy
group of British, American and Australian architecture
students erecting a cluster of ultra-modern constructions
made of bamboo, plastic and aluminium.
In Paris for the International Union of Architects Con¬
gress, the students organized, transported and set up their
own exhibition, "World Design Science Decade 1965-1975",
in which they expressed some avant-garde ideas on
structural principles.
Among the constructions rigged up by the students were
domes made of bamboo frames which, when covered
with different kinds of materials, will provide people living
in the tropics with more climate-resisting homes than their
present-day huts. The students also erected a 20 ft. sphere
of plastic film, a free-standing 20 ft. mast of bamboo and
cord and a "clamp system" hut of reinforced plastic units.
The main source of inspiration for the students' work is
the geodesic dome, an inexpensive, lightweight, easily
transported and erected construction with a basic design
of interlocked curved triangles, invented by the American
designer-engineer, R. Buckminster Fuller.
There are now 3,000 geodesic structures in 50 countries,
ranging from a 200 ft. dome in Sokolniki Park in Moscow,
serving as a sports arena and exhibition hall, to weather-
proofed cardboard ones which have withstood hurricane-
force winds in Puerto Rico. The geodesic principle
distributing the weight of a structure through interlocked
parabolic geometric shapes dispenses with heavy walls
and obstructing columns.
One of the students' constructions based on this
geodesic principle was a 20 ft. globe, "The Geoscope",
whose plastic cover was painted with a world map showing
the distribution of our planet's natural resources.

The great traditional sporting and athletic event in Czechoslovakia is the Spar¬
takiad which takes place every five years. These mammoth festivals began in
1955 when Czechoslovakia's sports and gymnastic groups, including the "Sokols"
(falcons) which date back to 1860, were grouped in a single organization Pre¬
paration for the Spartakiad begins years in advance; participants are in' training
for at least one hour a week two years before the event. The programme lasts
for several months and includes athletic competitions, games and mass gymnastic
demonstrations. Contests range from chess tournaments, cycling races and
basketball matches (one of the most popular sports among Czech youth) to
aircraft modelling, swimming and parachute jumping. Left, a women's gymnastic
group assembles and (above) a mass gymnastic display begins in the Strahov
stadium, Prague, where the Second Spartakiad was held in 1960. The 1965
Spartakiad competitions are lasting from May to August. Between July 1
and July 4 alone, more than 120,000 gymnasts gave mass displays in the stadium.

More than 1,000 million
under-25's
What ¡s the proportion of young people among the world's popu¬
lation? Is this proportion the same in the developing and in the
industrialized countries? Do young people all over the world face
the same kind of problems? Because of the increasing role assu¬
med by youth in all sectors of modern life questions such as these
have now become of worldwide concern. Below, The Unesco Cou¬
rier puts a number of them to Mr. Acher Deleon, Director of Unes¬
co's Department of Adult Education and Youth Activities.
QUESTION. For some time past a good deal has been
said about the rise of the younger generation in the world
and its growing importance in national life. To what extent
does youth today represent a new force?
ANSWER. Statistics show that more than half of the
total world population is below the age of 25. In some
countries the proportion is even higher than 60%. In
short, the human race has never been so young.
But, it is very difficult to point to particular features
that are shared by all young people today, just as difficult
as to pick out trends that could apply to mankind as a
whole. The important fact that needs emphasizing is that
there has never been such a high percentage of young
people in the world's population.
A breakdown by regions of the five to 24 year age-
group shows that 900 million young people live in the
developing countries as against 200 million in Europe and
North America. Africa has 103 million young people, Latin
America 89 million, Asia 700 million, Europe 135 million
and North America 65 million.
This tremendous mass of youth, which creates a quite
new situation, is chiefly a result of a drop in infant mortality
and a rise in standards of living.
We need to remember that there is a far higher pro¬
portion of young people in the developing countries than
in the so-called developed countries. In my view the core
of the problem is the development of education, since the
number of young people requiring a basic general education
is increasing every day. Primary and higher education are
expanding all the time even though the results achieved
are still not satisfactory. Similarly the proportion of young
people in employment is also increasing all over the world.
Q. At first sight that sounds rather like a contradiction.
Wouldn't it be reasonable to suppose that the more young¬
sters there are in school, the more of them will be kept
out of economic life until they have finished studying?
A. The number of young people sharing in the econo¬
mic life of each country is increasing just the same. It
should be made clear though that the percentage of 10 to
14 year-olds who are economically active is much greater
in the developing countries than in the developed countries.
In other words, young people are working at an age when
they ought not to be.
Q. That's the real point. Doesn't the history of the
developed countries show that child labour has decreased
considerably in the last 100 years?
A. In the developing countries the proportion of chil¬
dren between the ages of 10 and 14 who work is six times
higher than in' the developed countries. That is a really
striking figure. The actual percentage is 31 in the develop¬
ing as against barely five in the developed, which means
that many children are obliged to go to work instead of
going to school. This is certainly a vital problem and it is
gradually being solved by the developing countries, for with
economic and social progress the proportion of. child labour
inevitably falls.
Not unnaturally this sometimes meets with opposition
from parents, for whom it means a drop in income, and
from employers who lose this lower-paid, and thus more
economical, child labour. On the other hand, adults, among
whom there are many unemployed in these countries, also
exert pressure in the other direction in defence of their
own interests.
Young people are now playing an increasing part in
social and political affairs. This seems to me a very impor¬
tant fact. We are in a period of transition in which it is
particularly necessary for youth to help in solving problems
since this provides an effective counterweight to the tra¬
ditionalism of certain countries.
Q. Even in the highly developed countries the propor¬
tion of young people who go on to higher education is still
extremely low, and this problem nearly always seems to be
linked to the quest/on of family means. Do you think this
is a general rule throughout the world or are these isolated
cases?
A. Unfortunately they are not isolated cases far from
it, in fact. Even so, things are improving. Or course the
solution won't be found as though one were waving a
magic wand by awarding scholarships, since the problem

OVER 1.000 MILLION UNDER-25'S (Cont'd)
Adapting society
to youth
is a psychological and social one. The kind of conditions
must be created that allow students of all levels of society
not only to attend universities but also to achieve good
results.
There is also another side to the question. It seems
to me that if so many problems concerning modern youth
have still not been solved, the reasons are not only
lack of determination and lack of means, but also because
of the fear that young people may one day turn against
established institutions. I think the young are the chief
sufferers from underdevelopment: they suffer perhaps more
than any other section of the community from a lack of
means. In some countries young people form the majority
of the unemployed. There are even countries with a very
high percentage of young people who have completed their
studies but have not found employment.
Fortunately, there is a new trend toward voluntary or
organized participation by young people in national develop¬
ment. And young people themselves are increasingly aware
of the part they can play.
Q. Doesn't this Increased awareness of their new role
sometimes lead young people into political activities which
bring conflict with adults and tend to complicate the
situation?
A. I agree that young people who become aware of
the role they can play do find themselves in opposition to
adults. But I wouldn't say this necessarily complicates the
situation. I would even say that in many cases it makes
the solution of problems easier.
Q. What about the apathy shown by young people
towards social and political problems that has been noted
in some countries?
A. Such apathy is dangerous because it shows a
lack of interest in the community. It is extremely serious
and it may even be a danger for economic and social
development since these young people will be the citizens
of tomorrow and therefore responsible for what goes on in
the world. And there are other problems to be solved. In
some countries young people have little protection. Even
when they are lucky enough not to be unemployed, they are
badly paid and live in difficult conditions. They are often
badly housed. Their opportunities for intellectual develop¬
ment and for vocational training are also very restricted.
That brings me to the sense of frustration felt by young
people. I think this problem is being given increasing
attention by politicians, scientists, sociologists, youth move¬
ments, governments and international organizations.
Q. Frustration has been called the root cause of juve¬
nile delinquency. Would you agree with this?
A. Yes, I think it is one of the chief causes of problems
that affect all young people today. Frustration, in very
different forms of course, is the basic cause not only of
delinquency, but also of social disequilibrium and malad¬
justment. The real problem is not the eradication of delin¬
quency, but the social adaptation of youth. And if there
is to be a healthy equilibrium, not only must youth become
adapted to society; society will also have to learn how
to adapt itself to youth.

to help build a summer camp
for Soviet youth groups in the
southern Caucasus in 1963.
This work camp and others in
Great Britain and the U.S.A.
were part of the Tripartite
programmes arranged by orga¬
nizations in the three countries.
Young people shared in work
projects, talks and discussions.
Unesco- Gillette
by Margaret Rose
Friends Service Committee joined with the Friends Ser¬
vice Council of Great Britain and with the Committee of
Youth Organizations of the U.S.S.R. In the scheme, 30
volunteers between the ages of 20 and 30 (10 from each,
country, five men and five women) gather for a month .
in the summer to participate in a service project, usually
construction work, and a series of discussions.
The Tripartite programmes were held in Great Britain in
1962, then in the Soviet Union, and in 1964 in the United
States. For two and a half weeks, the participants live
together in the same quarters, think, discuss, and work
together in an effort to build relationships, with respect
and understanding.
Daily camp activity is usually divided into four or five
hours of work in the morning, planned discussions for
two to three hours in the afternoon and social activities
and excursions in the evening. Committees (one member
from each national group) plan work, discussions, and
housekeeping. Leaders from each national group form
a special committee.
HE host country has naturally tended to make
detailed plans for the project, including social
activities, tours, receptions, and the like. The participants,
however, have asked for more opportunity to plan some
part of the available time themselves.
Although the work project is undertaken with the idea
of advancing a community project, it is also meant to
provide an opportunity for a sense of shared purpose
and an impetus to informal conversations.
In Bristol, England, in 1962, the participants worked on
a construction project already started by a local commu¬
nity improvement association. They helped to build a
centre for social and educational activities. It was esti¬
mated that their three weeks' work accomplished what
the community would have needed five months to com¬
plete! There were professionnal foremen to guide the
work plan, and the work team organized the volunteers
into groups each day and dispatched them to lay bricks,
pour cement, hammer nails, etc.
In 1963, in the southern Caucasus region of the Soviet
Union, the participants helped to construct a Young
Pioneer's Summer Camp owned by the local Confectioner's
Trade Union of Kalbardinia-Balkaria. In the United States
in 1964, Tripartite volunteers helped expand the facilities
of Camp Reinberg, a camp used by children from many
parts of Chicago.
ORE and more young people are now taking
part in volunteer international exchange pro¬
grammes with students from other countries. There are
many different types of programmes, but all have in common
the purpose of trying to develop better understanding
between citizens of different nations.
Working for "better understanding" is a euphemism heard
among university student groups around the world. Satis¬
factory ways of getting youth together to discuss their
views, however, have been difficult to develop. One
programme which provides a setting for a real inter¬
change of ideas, and consequently better understanding,
is the Tripartite Work and Study Projects.
To arrange this programme which combines a volun¬
tary work project and planned discussions, the American
IFFERENCES of opinion do exist among those
taking part about the merits of the work projects
and the work experience in general. Some have said
that the need for their work was not great, and that they
therefore lacked a feeling of purpose. Others say that
it does not matter what the work is, since the important
thing is the communication between the workers rather
than the material results. Some volunteers believe it is
a mistake to stress the value of conversation at the
expense of work. Another criticism is that physical work
in the morning is so exhausting that the volunteers have
not enough energy left to discuss important matters in
the afternoon. It has also been suggested that there gj
should be more contact between workers and the people
for whom the work is being done.

these volunteers was paid
by contributions from several
organizations including the Bri¬
tish Red Cross and the Oxford
Committee for Famine Relief.

In 50 developing nations
20,000 VOLUNTEER WORKERS
FOR PROGRESS & FRIENDSHIP
by Arthur Gillette
I t is natural that the young people of Asia,
Africa and Latin America wish to respond to
the challenge of underdevelopment. Their future, more
than that of their elders, is threatened by sickness,
ignorance and poverty. Along with their regular school
or work activities, which they may not always see as
contributing directly to development, they take part by
the millions in workcamps and non-manual voluntary
service projects. They build roads, teach literacy, improve
medical facilities, and do a host of other jobs that contribute
to progress in their countries.
But what of youth in the industrialized nations to
whom the world of the developing countries seems so
far away and so different? They too are concerned about the
plight and the struggle of the developing lands.
The accession of African and Asian countries to inde¬
pendence has aroused the interest of young people of
industrialized regions in the problems of underdevelopment
during the last decade. So has the rise of leaders in Latin
America who are dedicated to raising living standards and
broadening social and cultural opportunities on that conti¬
nent. This new interest is concentrated in youth movements
whose members take part increasingly in campaigns and
meetings concerned with the developing countries. It also
reaches attentive readers and listeners and viewers of the
mass media, which are dealing more and more frequently
with the subject.
This interest has led to action, and many of the young
people in industrial countries are not content to sit by as
spectators of one of the most enthralling dramas of the
twentieth century. They want to play an active role
and are doing so increasingly by serving as long-term
volunteers in the developing countries.
One of the most widely known programmes of long-
term international voluntary service is the United States
Peace Corps. Launched in 1961 by President John F.
Kennedy, the Peace Corps quickly caught the imagin¬
ation of young Americans of widely differing walks of
life. Today, some 9,000 Peace Corps men and women
are at work in nearly 50 countries. They are staffing
a broad range of posts requiring average skills in such
fields as nursing, construction, agronomy and teaching.
The first long-term volunteers from industrialized areas
went off to work in a developing country a quarter of a
century before the initiative taken by President Kennedy.
In 1934, Pierre Ceresole, son of a President of Switzerland,
led a team of Europeans sponsored by Service Civil Inter¬
national to Bihar, India, where they helped reconstruct
villages stricken by earthquakes and floods. Later and
especially after the second world war, various organiz
ations, including the World Council of Churches and the
International Builder Companions, followed this example.
New programmes, such as Voluntary Service Overseas,
in Great Britain, were created.
In the last four years the growth of voluntary service
has been phenomenal : nearly 20,000 long-term volunteers
from two dozen industrialized countries (1) are now working
in some 50 developing nations. In some countries and in
some professions, volunteers account for a significant
proportion of all medium-skilled personnel. In 1964, for
example, U.S. Peace Corpsmen constituted 50 per cent
of Liberia's secondary school teaching staff.
About 250 organizations national and international,
governmental and private, of various inspirations are
currently involved in recruiting, training and sending out
medium-skilled young volunteers from North America,
Eastern and Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
Voluntary service is, however, more than a vehicle for
transferring needed technical skills to the newly developing
nations. It enables volunteers to get to know and under¬
stand the people of these countries; and these peoples in
turn learn more about the countries from which the volun¬
teers have come.
HIS international understanding is neither super¬
ficial nor temporary. Working together toward
common aims, living in similar, simple conditions, surmount¬
ing frustations and frictions, the two groups can learn to
tolerate the differences that separate them, and then may
make a lasting reality of an underlying solidarity.
The common philosophy of the long-term service organi¬
zations is simple. For these organizations, their volunteers
and the host countries, international service has a twin aim
and double value. Firstly, it serves as a vehicle of manpower
supply which facilitates the transfer of skills to and training
of national personnel in the newly developing areas of the
world. It is also a crucible in which day-to-day difficulties
and successes, shared by local people and volunteers alike,
shape deep and lasting international understanding.
A description of the service given by three typical volun¬
teers should help to bring home its real significance.

20.000 VOLUNTEERS (Cont'd)
Working themselves out of a job
58
Miss Alison MacEwen, 23, received a B.A. in social
anthropology from the University of Edinburgh in the
summer of 1964. While a student, she took part in the
activities of the U.K. Council on Education for World
Citizenship, served in several international voluntary
workcamps, surveyed village schools to be affected by
Glasgow town planning, and travelled extensively in Europe
and elsewhere.
Sponsored by the United Nations Association of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, Alison began a two-year
assignment in Latin America as sociologist with a youth
movement for the U.N. last September. Her job consists
of taking censuses and analysing data in preparation for
workcamps and other service projects sponsored by this
movement. However, assembling dry facts and figures
is less important for Alison than the human contacts she
makes on her rounds. During January and February of
this year, she helped organize a neighbourhood develop¬
ment project in a poor quarter of a semi-industrial town.
Miss MacEwen reported : "We have managed to get
the women of the families I visit each day to come and
meet volunteers in a sort of shelter with a roof of straw,
where we give their children milk. We explain to the
mothers the importance of daily milk for their children,
and we're hoping to get the distribution established as
a routine event each morning.
"It often happens that the poor people are reluctant
to admit their problems, and are even less ready to come
to an institution such as a health centre. We are over¬
coming this through my visits, and by inviting them to
meet us where the surroundings are informal and there
is no atmosphere of 'authority.' When the community cen¬
tre we are building is finished these people will already be
used to working with strangers and the installations of medi¬
cal services should be smoother than it would otherwise
have been."
BOGDAN Szcygiel is a doctor in his mid-thirties
from Olkuz, Poland. After finishing his medical
studies, he initiated the "White Sundays" scheme through
which he and other qualified members of the Polish Union
of Rural Youth spent their Sundays touring out-of-the-way
villages in the Cracow region giving courses on first aid
and family planning.
Recruited in October 1964 through the Polish Committee
for International Co-operation, he joined a team of Service
Civil International volunteers working in and around
Tlemcen, Algeria, where he became leader of medical
activities.
Dr. Szcygiel directed a team of volunteers that included
another Polish doctor as well as nurses from Belgium,
England and Germany. Each member of this group
ministered to the medical needs of approximately 4,000
inhabitants of the Tlemcen area. In the city itself, the
volunteers organized and dispensed medical care in the
poor quarters, gave first-aid courses, and helped Algerian
personnel to prepare their examinations leading to more
advanced medical study. Dr. Szcygiel also led a small
flying team in the countryside surrounding Tlemcen which
gave medical assistance, helped with child-rearing and
introduced balanced diets to tent camps of nomads as
well as to permanent villages.
Last April, at the end of his service period, he returned
to Poland, and talked and wrote much about his work
as a volunteer. Strongly impressed by the needs of
Algeria and the scarcity of facilities and personnel, he
is now collecting medical equipment which he will take with
him when he returns to the country under a Polish technical
assistance programme in the next few months.
native of the eastern state of Maine (U.S.A.),
^young Peace Corpsman Robert Johnson has
served as a teacher at Ubon Teachers College in northeast
Thailand. Recently, at the end of his first year's service,
he wrote: "Life as a volunteer is rather unspectacular.
Whatever we are, whatever we do, we find ourselves
closely involved in the day-to-day affairs of the institutions
in which we teach or work. The glamour of living half
way around the world has worn off. Life has become rou¬
tine, even dull at times.
"But when the glamour wears off, something else comes
to take its place. This something else is a sense of being
at home, of being at ease in Thailand. When we arrived,
for instance, most Thais were surprised to see us wai
(bow with the hands joined as for praying) to our superiors.
Some liked it, some laughed (in Thailand, often an
expression of embarrassment), and some told us frankly
that farang (foreigners) should not wai."
The 250 or so organizations involved in long-term service
have differing aims, approaches and resources. Never¬
theless, we can say that the experience of most volunteers
parallels that of the three just described. They work at jobs
requiring average-level skills for from six to twenty-four
months. They live in simple, sometimes primitive, conditions.
They receive an amount of pocket money that is sometimes
equivalent to the pay of their local counterparts, but less
than they could earn doing a similar, salaried job at home.
They seek to pass on specific knowledge as well as
enthusiasm, thereby hoping to enlarge the pool of skilled
local manpower and to work themselves or their volunteer
successors out of a job. They learn as much (if not
more) than they teach, and become deeply and per¬
manently interested in the developing countries in general,
and "their" country in particular.
Since 1962 Unesco has aided the Co-ordinating Com¬
mittee for International Voluntary Service to undertake
various research projects in this field to ensure exchange
of information among bodies sending and receiving volun¬
teers, and to disseminate publicity on service possibilities
to prospective volunteers (2).
Critics have said that long-term voluntary service is a
passing fad. A more serious criticism which has been
made is that volunteers are often so young that they
lack experience of life. Other critics have pointed out
that volunteers are ignorant of the cultures and civilizations
in the countries they visit and therefore are generally ¡II-

A member of Service Civil International's British branch
said recently: "Twenty years ago you were considered
a bit of a crank if you went on a short-term voluntary
workcamp. Today, long-term service is something of
a status symbol among young people in the indus¬
trialized countries." However, as the enthusiastic pioneer
phase of large-scale volunteer activities comes to a close,
sponsors and users alike are making a thorough appraisal
of long-term service. Indications are that in the future
there may be less, euphoria about volunteers, but more
volunteers, used more efficiently.
So long as the lack of averagely-skilled manpower
persists in the developing countries, and so long as there
is a need for better understanding between young men and
women of different races, continents and ideologies, long-
term voluntary service will remain a prime means of
international co-operation among youth.

A GENERATION
OF BUILDERS
by Yuri Kotier
INE way of assessing this planet's future is to
find an answer to the question "What are the
young people of the mid-20th century like?" This article is
an attempt to present a few answers from one country,
the U.S.S.R. and to see what things Soviet youth are
thinking about, what their hopes, ambitions and preoccu¬
pations are today.
This is an age of tremendous change. It has known
revolutions and world wars, it has been called the cosmic
age and the atomic age and it is also the age of the ther¬
monuclear bomb. Still it is also an age of the new: it is the
age of humanism. For the first time, men have seriously con¬
sidered general disarmament as a global issue. Scores of
countries have been freed from colonialism to build a new
life. Science has soared to unprecedented heights and is
laying the groundwork for the welfare of mankind as a
whole. In all these new developments we find young people
in the forefront.
It is true that some persons have called this the "age
of the lost generations". The idea that thermonuclear war
is inevitable has gained some ground among young people,
and has prompted some to adopt the gather-ye-rose-buds-
while-ye-may attitude, but the egoists and the weak have
never been representative of humanity as whole.
It has been my good fortune to be able to attend many
discussions and debates carried out by youth groups in
various parts of the Soviet Union, from Moscow to Sverd¬
lovsk, from Murmansk to Kherson, and Kodand to Tallin.
I
62
F I were asked to sum up the views of Soviet
youth in one sentence, I would say that what
characterizes the young people of our country today is
optimism. Soviet youth reject pessimism; they refuse to
take things for granted or live in a rut; they possess a deep
sense of responsibility to the world they live in and will not
remain on the sidelines; they are eager for a fuller spiritual
life and will not be kept within the narrow bounds of conven¬
tion.
Although Soviet young men and women may have
differences of opinion about different things in life they
do agree on one point: this is a generation of builders,
and everyone must work together to build a new life. In
the last decade young people have played an important,
often a key, part in every major development undertaking,
ranging from the ploughing up of virgin lands in the
eastern areas of the Soviet Union to the development
of public self-administration.
Young people have journeyed to the Far North beyond
the Arctic Circle, to Siberia and Central Asia in the Far
East, living in tents under rudimentary conditions in order
to build new towns and heavy industries, dams and mines.
In the past few years a million and a half young men and
women have gone out to work at the country's major
construction sites. In Siberia alone 22 new towns and
140 housing projects have sprung up, thousands of kilo¬
metres of gas and oil pipelines have been laid and over
15,000 kilometres of railways have been built and electrified,
thanks to Youth Projects.
typical example is Temir-Tau near Karaganda,
the centre of Kazakhstan's coal basin in Soviet
central Asia. In the old days it was a small village. Then
the government decided to build giant steel and copper
works in the area.
Temir-Tau was declared a Youth Project and a call was
issued to young men and women all over the country who
were not afraid of roughing it, living in tents and doing
really strenuous work. Tens of thousands of boys and
girls responded to the call. By the end of the 1950s Temir-
Tau had a population of 59,000. Today the figure has risen
to 150,000 and more than half of the inhabitants are under
23. The city itself is a replica of the U.S.S.R., its population
being made up of people from every Soviet Republic, region
and territory.
There are now over 130 Youth Projects in action through¬
out the country though most are in the wild parts of
Siberia, the Far North and Central Asia. This urge to
build, to overcome difficulties and create a new future is
marred neither by fanaticism nor asceticism. Nor are the
human elements of life denied; indeed a great effort is now
being made to intensify them.
Soviet youth are no different in many ways from youth
in other parts of the world today. They are bursting with
vitality and give vent to their ¡oie de vivre in various
forms. They like to ride motorcycles or walk about with
transistor radios slung across their shoulders; they love
jazz and the most modern forms of dancing; they carry
on heated debates about modern art, and have even taken

to wearing fancy shirts and pinning pictures of film stars
in the driver's cab of their lorries which they drive at
breakneck speed along Siberia's endless highways.
An increasing number of Soviet youth are now specializing
in science and technology. And scientists and engineers
under 30 make up a large percentage of the personnel
of leading industrial and technical institutions. In certain
Institutes of the Academy of Science 50 to 85 per cent of
the scientists are under 30 years of age.
"Have you ever been to Komsomolsk-on-Amur?" one youth
recently wrote, "I helped to build it. I am a romanticist by
vocation. I am sure there is such a vocation. It was cold
and hungry living in the thickly overgrown taiga where we
erected the world's first youth city. But we had a romantic
vision. We knew that in building that new city we were
bringing about a revolutionary change in our country."
This attitude describes one of the chief traits of Soviet
youth today who believe that helping others is the most
important thing in life and see their work as part of the
reshaping of their country.
In this connexion it is worth noting that collective action
was recently voted the chief characteristic of modern
Soviet men and women at all youth debates across the
country. "You are responsible for everything", is a very
popular slogan among young people today who consider
themselves responsible for everything occurring around
them, both good and bad. They feel that the present is
their responsibility and even more so the future.
The largest youth group in the U.S.S.R. is the Komsomol.
This organization, in which the idea of collective action
is a dominating one, had 22,000 members some 47 years
ago and today boasts 22 million.
Recently the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy
of Science of the U.S.S.R. carried out a public opinion poll
of young persons in the Moscow area. One thousand young
people employed by the Moscow Electrical Engineering
Works were asked to reply to six questions affecting their
work and their everyday lives. Their answers were highly
revealing.
The first question dealt with salaries and youth's attitude
to work. Answers: "Wages are important but the main
thing is the meaning and social usefulness of your work"
42 per cent; "Any work is good so long as the pay is

The young people of the U.S.S.R. are passionately fond of poetry and Soviet poets often
come to read their works to enthusiastic audiences in which youth is well represented.

good" 2 per cent; "Salaries are the main thing but the
work you do also counts" 12 per cent; "What counts
most is doing a good job, having a job where they can't
do without you" 40 per cent; "I can't stand the work"
1.5 per cent; "Don't know" 2.5 per cent.
Question Two: "How would you spend your time if working
hours were drastically cut?" Answers: "Watch more televi¬
sion" 8 per cent; "Take a study course, enrol at a technical
institute or college, read more books" 27 per cent; "See
more plays, take up some form of art" 17.5 per cent;
"Take up sport" 24 per cent; "Take it easy" 2 per cent;
"Look for another job to make more money" 1 per cent;
"Take up technical invention" 20 per cent; "Don't know"
0.5 per cent.
These replies show a marked tendency on the part of
Soviet youth to go in for self-improvement activities such
as home study, art, sport and technical training.
In a book published last year, "Marriage and Family in the
U.S.S.R.", by Dr. A. Kharchev, we find a study of the atti¬
tudes towards love and marriage of young people and
newly-weds in the city of Leningrad. Almost 85 per cent
of all marriages of persons under 30 in Leningrad and
just about half the total number of marriages in the city
take place at the Leningrad Palace of Marriages. Here Dr.
Kharchev interviewed 500 couples and collected further
data from an additional 300. Of those polled 21 per cent
were workers, 28 per cent students, 10 per cent engineers
and technicians, and the remaining 41 per cent office
workers, doctors or young persons employed in various
occupations dealing with the arts and sciences.
In answer to the question, "What in your opinion is the
chief factor making for a happy marriage?", 76.2 per cent
said love, or love and similar attitudes; or mutual trust;
sincerity; friendship, etc. Equality of status and mutual
respect was the reply given by 13.2 per cent; love and a
good flat to live in by 4 per cent; love and money, 1.6 per
cent; children, 0.6 per cent; and a realistic view of life,

0.2 per cent. Only 4.2 per cent replied they didn't know.
Even if we assume that all those who answered "Don't
know" considered the material factors to be the most
important for a happy marriage we find that no more
than 5 per cent of the total number of young people polled
can be classed as "materialists". It is obvious that for
the overwhelming majority moral factors are by far more
important.
This of course does not mean that young people complet¬
ely pooh-pooh material conditions. Sample interviews
carried out by Dr. Kharchev showed that young couples
getting married in Leningrad are by no means blind to the
importance of economic and other material factors in married
life but in cases of conflict, moral considerations take
precedence.
When young people point out that they feel both partners
in marriage should be equal, they do not mean by this that
marriage is a business arrangement. For Soviet youth today
marriage is above all a question of love, and they do
not think there is anything old fashioned about such an atti¬
tude. If a couple is in love, they say, that's what counts most,
and not having a flat for themselves, or money in a savings
account or a television set should not prevent them from
getting married.
Of course this is not the whole picture. Today's generation
of youth has many faces, and it is never completely like
the one in the advertisement. One can find every type of
person among Soviet youth today. There are the egotists
and the opportunists, the cheats and the drunkards, the
rowdies and the delinquents. Youth groups are conscious
of this and are making every effort to deal with such
persons and to reintegrate them into their community.
The wealth of a nation, as everyone knows, is its youth,
for youth are a nation's great natural resource and the basis
of its strength. It is in the measure that society as a whole
understands its young people and allows youth to participate
on a footing with grown-ups in the activities of a nation
that the future society can be built on firm foundations.
YURI KOTLER, the Soviet author and journalist, is a specialist on
sociology and youth problems. He is a special correspondent of
the magazine, "Soviet Union".

UNESCO & YOUTH... UNESCO & YOUTH... UNES
UNESCO'S work for youth cuts across all its major
activities. In developing its programme for youth during
its nearly twenty years of existence, Unesco has taken
special account of two major facts in the present-day world:
the increasing place and role of young people in the life of most
countries, and a vast expansion of out-of-school youth activ¬
ities. Unesco has worked closely with governmental and non¬
governmental bodies and has sponsored and helped to launch
a great number and variety of youth projects. We present
below a sampling of Unesco activities on behalf of youth.
LEADER TRAINING: Recognizing the need for regular
contacts between leaders of youth groups in different
countries, Unesco has organized seminars and information
and study courses in various regions. Study courses were
held in Rangoon (Burma) in 1952; Tokyo (Japan) in 1953
and Havana (Cuba) in 1954 and comprised lectures, dis¬
cussions and practical work which taught youth organizers
how ycung people can contribute to community develop¬
ment.
SPORTS COUNCIL: An International Council on Sport
and Physical Education was set up during the 1960 Olympic
Games in Rome. The creation of this council was one
of the results of the conference on sport, work and culture
the first broadly international meeting of its kind organ¬
ized earlier the same year by the Government of Finland
and Unesco.
UNESCO CLUBS: Hundreds of Unesco Clubs are now
active in nearly a score of countries spanning the world
from Australia to Finland and from Japan (100 clubs and
100 Unesco Associations) to France (280 clubs). Unesco
Clubs work for better international understanding and
spread information about Unesco's aims and work. They
are largely run by their young members and their pro¬
grammes include correspondence exchanges, group travel,
exhibitions, lectures, discussion groups and participation
in international voluntary workcamps.
AFRICAN FORUM: More and more young people in
Africa are reading a periodical that tells them about the
aims and work of the United Nations. Produced since
1963 by students at Ibadan, Nigeria, with assistance from
Unesco, it has now become a forum for young people to
express their views on international questions that concern
the U.N.
VOLUNTARY SERVICE: When Unesco created the Co¬
ordinating Committee for International Voluntary Service
in 1948, it had 18 member associations. Today it has
91 member associations from all continents. The Commit¬
tee serves as an information centre on international vol¬
untary workcamps and long-term service programmes, and
it has organized regional training courses for voluntary
service leaders in the developing countries.
00 YOUTH INSTITUTE: A special international institute set
up by Unesco has been working for the youth of the
world since 1952 at Gauting, near Munich (Federal Republic
of Germany). Surveys and meetings organized by the
Unesco Youth Centre have covered a broad spectrum of
youth problems and activities including the operation of
youth organizations, education in economics and science,
education for international understanding, the effects of
technological change and the eradication of racial prejudice.
EXCHANGING EXPERIENCE: In 1955 Unesco started
its system of Associated Youth Enterprises to promote the
exchange of experience among youth organizations in
different countries. Under this scheme a team of youth
hostel members from England, Australia, Pakistan, Ireland,
Spain, India and the Netherlands recently travelled from
London to Calcutta by the simplest and cheapest route.
A guidebook, "Overland Route: Guide to Western Asia",
based on their experiences has now been published.
STUDY GRANTS: Since 1952, 576 full travel grants and
189 partial grants have been made to leaders of national
and international youth organizations under Unesco's pro¬
gramme of Youth Leader Travel Grants. The grants have
enabled youth organizers to study youth activities abroad
and to pick up new ideas and techniques for use in their
own countries.
SCIENCE CLUBS: Last year Unesco helped to create
a special committee on science clubs. This committee
which has relations with science fairs, clubs and camps
in Eastern and Western Europe, the Americas, Asia and
Africa, is currently preparing a manual explaining how to
organize science programmes for young people, and a
comprehensive international directory of bodies sponsoring
such activities. (See page 40 for an article on the world's
science clubs).
GIFT COUPONS: Since Unesco's Gift Coupon Pro¬
gramme was launched 15 years ago, nearly a million and a
half dollars has been raised in large part by the young
people of the industrialized countries. Much of this money
has gone to help key youth projects in Africa, Asia and

duced a series of weekly international programmes on youth
earlier this year. The programme, "Youth in the World",
included discussions on sport, urban development, archaeo¬
logy, the developing countries, astronautics, workcamps,
folk music and Unesco Clubs interspersed with the latest
pop music and folk recordings. Among those who took
part in the programmes, along with a host of young people,
were Professor Noraïr Sissakian, the U.S.S.R. Academician,
who is a world authority on space biology and chairman
of the 13th session of Unesco's General Conference, and
Mr. Papa Diouf, president of the Senegalese Freedom from
Hunger Committee.
ORIENT-OCCIDENT: As part of its efforts to develop
education for international understanding and co-operation,
Unesco encourages the formation of youth clubs for inter¬
national relations, which are often called clubs of Friends
of Unesco. One recent example was the contact estab¬
lished between young workers in Saint-Etienne, France,
and Kokura, Japan, who have learned about the ways of
life in each other's cities from exhibitions which they
prepared and exchanged.
YOUNG PEOPLE'S DIRECTORY: Unesco has published
an international Directory of Unesco Clubs and Similar
Associations. It can be obtained free of charge from the
Public Liaison Division, Unesco, Place de Fontenoy, Paris.
With Unesco's assistance, the French Federation of Unesco
Clubs has brought out a manual, "Les Clubs Unesco:
Pourquoi, Pour Qui, Comment," explaining why Unesco
Clubs exist, whom they are for and how they work. The
manual is designed as a guide to setting up and running
international relations clubs. An English edition is in pre¬
paration.
CONFERENCE ON YOUTH: Last year, Unesco convened
an international conference in Grenoble, France, to take
stock of out-of-school activities and to lay foundations
for a long-tern* Unesco Youth Programme. It was the
first ¡nter-governmantal conference ever held on youth
problems. Delegates, including those from 70 Unesco mem¬
ber states, unanimously approved recommendations that will
guide the future development of out-of-school programmes.
In March 1965, Unesco helped the Government of Japan
to organize a regional meeting to plan the development of
youth activities in Asia.
FILMS: With Unesco's assistance, groups of young
women in Asia and Latin America last year carried out
surveys of the impact made on young people in their
countries by locally-produced and foreign films.
MUSIC AND YOUTH: Outstanding among Unesco's
work for the development of musical appreciation in young
people is its long-standing co-operation with the Interna¬
tional Federation of Musical Youth. This international
organization has member sections in 23 countries and new
groups are being formed in 17 others. Travel grants made
by Unesco have helped to make possible exchange visits
between members of these groups, and Unesco's support
and financial aid have enabled the International Federation
to send musicians on international visits to its member
sections.
YOUTH TODAY: Unesco is preparing a book on "Youth
today, its problems and activities". This work will present
for the first time a world picture of the trends and activities
of youth in the form of a broad comparative study. It
will also review present-day concepts on out-of-school
education, its aims and the ways in which it is used.

ONE CAMP, THREE NATIONS (Cont'd from page 53)
Tm a graduate in economics
but now I'm peeling potatoes'
No one has proposed that the work experience be drop¬
ped from the programme. The purpose of the criticism,
which is sought at the end of each camp in evalua¬
tion sessions, is to improve the quality of the work
experience. Some of the suggestions are being tried out
this summer in Great Britain, when the second series of
Tripartite begins. The work programme will be altered.
Instead of being planned for half a day over a longer period,
it is expected that the work will be concentrated in one
week with an eight hour day. Less time will be spent on
work than in previous years; more emphasis will be given
to meeting youth and community groups in the neigh¬
bourhood of the project and to visiting places of interest.
Besides doing construction work, the camp members
help with chores around the living quarters assigned to
them. In Bristol, participants prepared all their own meals.
A Russian at Bristol remarked: "I'm a graduate in econo¬
mics of Moscow University. Now I'm peeling potatoesl We
talk as much as possible, exchange views and laugh a
lot." In the Soviet Union a local chef did most of the
cooking, but there was a national dinner night for Great
Britain and the United States when the volunteers from
those countries cooked and served their own national
dishes.
In the afternoons all 30 volunteers sit down together
in a discussion group. What kinds of topics are discus¬
sed? The problems and responsibilities of youth in the
modern world is the most basic theme, but each year camp
participants decide for themselves more specifically what
they want to discuss. In 1963, topics chosen included.
The Cultural Values of Youth, Youth's Ideology and Morals,
The Individual and the Collective, Peace and Disarmament.
Among those for 1964, were How Does an Individual Form
His Own Code of Ethics? What Limits Should We Impose
on Individual Freedom? How Do We Build a World Commu¬
nity That Permits Diversity? Each of these topics is intro¬
duced by a keynote speaker and then, for the next three
days, about nine hours are spent putting questions and
exchanging points of view.
Q
68
UESTIONS such as these are discussed at
length: "If art is a rich experience of mankind,
with whom should it be shared?" "Does an artist produce
spontaneously or from a preconceived idea?" "Can art
replace religion as a spiritual experience?" Or, concern¬
ing Youth's Ideology and Morals: " In what way does
youth in your country discuss its problem?" "Do you
consider a dissenting minority among youth to be a
problem?" "Does reason or emotion tie one to an ideal?"
"How have the ideals in our societies originated?" " How
do we approach individuals who do not live up to
these ideals?" "Is nonviolence an effective technique of
social change?"
Experience in these discussions shows that topics which
touch first of all on our common humanity and social
functions are more valuable than topics requiring much
detailed factual information about economics and politics.
For example, first-hand information from individuals who
have participated in movements of social change and deve¬
lopment in their own countries is a source of new know
ledge for everyone. Also, discussion about broad social
and moral ideas challenges each participant to examine
his own thinking. This process of seeing others with
different ideas thinking about the same problems as one¬
self, when combined with work and the routine patterns of
daily camp life, builds respect and understanding.
I N the second and third camps, the discussion
group of thirty persons was divided into smaller
groups for at least one out of the three days spent on
each topic. Some people objected to this method because
it was then not possible to hear what everybody had to
say; but others felt that it increased opportunities for
discussion in depth and encouraged less forceful speakers
to express themselves.
Past participants suggest many ways to improve the
discussion sessions. Some say there should be more
preparation beforehand to give discussions a more factual
content. Others feel there should be no topics assigned
and that they should be allowed to develop naturally
within the group in the course of its association. Still
others say it is somewhat artificial to focus on youth when,
in fact, the discussion deals with philosophical and social
concerns regardless of age.
These criticisms, and those regarding the work project,
must be judged and understood in the spirit of the Tri¬
partite experiment as a whole. The spirit is one of co¬
operation and a deep desire to work at improving not
only a programme, but a relationship. Tripartite is built
on years of effort and hours of discussion. Each summer
participants from former camps (up to three from each
country are permitted) join the new campers. Each year
the leaders relate to the new members some of the
issues and experiences of the previous camps.
The attitude of co-operation which does not hide
differences and does not fear imperfections is one of the
important experiences in understanding that has developed
from Tripartite. Understanding, after all, is not something
that is acquired and preserved, but an active, restless
thought process. Sometimes it is more perfect than others,
but always it aims to strengthen the constructive relation¬
ships between men.
Perhaps the final lesson for many participants, which
becomes clear when they return to their countries, is that
understanding is a responsibility. It cannot exist for the
benefit of others if it is dormant; it has to live and develop
in individual lives and in society.
A programme similar to Tripartite was held in 1964 in
Poland, and one is planned in Eastern Germany this year.
There is good reason to believe that the Tripartite idea
could be practiced between nations in many parts of the
world. Understanding this, young people have a respon¬
sibility to try to make it possible.

COLOUR PAGES
Sir,
Readers of The Unesco Courier
were promised pages in colour.
I greatly admired the December 1964
number with its handsome colour
illustrations on Abu Simbel and the
issue with colour pages on the City
of Aphrodite in January 1965. Since
then all Illustrations have been in
black and white. Why is this?

in four or five Issues. We regret that
we are not in a position to offer
colour pages every month.

THE CAUSES OF RACIALISM
Sir.
Your recent number presenting the'
results of studies on race and
racialism (April 1965) was passionately
interesting. However, you failed to
deal with the essential question, one
that is of prime importance in the
struggle against racialism: the rational
analysis of the basic causes of this
scourge as it exists in the 20th century.
Only through an analysis of its
psychological, geographical, human
and material origins shall we find an
effective way to combat it.
Why does it take such virulent
forms in certain parts of the world?
Why does it influence and change the
behaviour of all kinds of people?
This is the core of the problem and
a study on these lines would provide

YOUNG POSTER DESIGNERS
Sir,
The message, "To the Young People
of the World", by Mr. René Maheu,
Director General of Unesco (Jan.
1965) at the start of the United
Nations International Co-operation
Year, inspired the young people in
my class to design posters on this
theme which symbolize the solidarity
of the human race, irrespective of
race and colour. Some of the
designs produced by these youngsters
are quite promising as you will see
from the enclosed selection.

Sir,
I am working on a biography of the
well-known Russian biologist, Nicolai

Kolitsov had many ties with European
scientists and maintained a corres¬
pondence with some of them for
several years. I would like to ask
your magazine to help me in
assembling facts for this biography,
by publishing an appeal to all those
who knew Professor Kolitsov to send
me any memoirs, letters etc. they may
have.

PRINCE JAI SINGH
Sir,
Your article, "The Stones of Jaipur
Speak of Astronomy" (June 1965) is
informative and well illustrated.
Permit me, however, to point out the
following: Jaipur is about 150 miles
(235 km.) from Delhi by air and not
60 miles as mentioned in the article;
Prince Jai Singh, ruler of Jaipur, was
a Hindu and not a Moslem as was
stated.

COURIER IN THE CLASSROOM
Sir,
I have just received the April 1965
issue of The Unesco Courier. It is
excellent. The "Race and Prejudice"
theme has aroused the interest of
people who rarely read the "Courier".
The scientific approach to the question
has been very well handled. Fur¬
thermore, the 13-point statement on
the biological aspects of the race
question is extremely informative.
Bravol
May I enquire whether you have
any of this sort of material in suitable
form to put on the walls of a secondary
school classroom. I would also be
interested in off-prints of the facts
and figures published in The Unesco
Courier on arms spending in the world
(Nov.' 1964); these are also to be put
on classroom walls.

WORLD VIEW OF SPORT
Sir,
I enjoy every feature of The Unesco
Courier. My only regret is that arti¬
cles on sport are not featured more
often. By this I mean sport In the
true sense of the term: the develop¬
ment of educational and athletic
games, and not just the cult of "muscle
building".
I am sure each country must have
different traditions in sport, evolved
from national characteristics and, of
course, from its geographic situation.
I would like to have a world view of
sport.

From the Unesco Newsr
UNESCO SALUTES SPACE FEAT: The
Director-General of Unesco, Mr. René
Maheu, sent the following message to
President Johnson on June 4: "On occa¬
sion success Gemini flight of Majors
McDivitt and White wish to convey to you
my congratulations for this great contri¬
bution to scientific and technological pro¬
gress. Unesco applauds this conquest of
space which opens bold perspectives for
the future of mankind. My best wishes to
you, the American scientists and astro¬
nauts for this historic achievement."
WORLD SCIENCE GUIDE: Unesco has
published a "World Guide to Science
Information and Documentation Services"
(price : 13/- stg.; $2.50 and 9 Frs.) which
gives facts on 144 information centres in
65 countries where documentary research
work is carried out in science, agricul¬
ture and medicine. Subjects covered in
each centre and services provided library,
bibliographies, translation, photo-reproduc¬
tion are listed in English and French.
PLANNING AFRICA'S EDUCATION:
Unesco is to receive a grant of
$340,000 from the Ford Foundation for
research projects and for a special train¬
ing and research programme in Africa to
be conducted by the International Institute
of Educational Planning. The three-year
programme will concentrate on major prob¬
lems of educational planning, teacher
supply and demand, educational cost and
finance and the integration of educational
planning with economic and social develop¬
ment.
FOR NUCLEAR STUDIES: A new recruit
to the Unesco network of international
post-graduate training courses, now ope¬
rating in 13 countries, is the French Nation¬
al Institute of Nuclear Science and Tech¬
nology, at Saclay, near Paris. This autumn,
the institute will offer courses In metallur¬
gy, electronics and analytical chemistry to
university teachers and research workers
from developing countries.
GUIDE TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANI¬
ZATIONS: Dedicated to the Interna¬
tional Co-operation Year, the latest (10th)
edition of the Yearbook of International
Organizations has now been published by
the Union of International Associations in
co-operation with the U.N. It describes
1,897 organizations (1,718 non-governmen¬
tal and 179 Intergovernmental). Published
in English, but with names given in four
languages where possible and keyword
indexes in French and English, the Year¬
book costs £5.50; U.S.$18.00 or 80 Frs.
It can be obtained from the Union of
International Associations, 1, Rue aux Lai¬
nes, Brussels, Belgium or through book¬
stores.
SMALL INDUSTRIES, BIG RESULTS: An
increasing number of small industries
in Malaysia are benefiting from internation¬
al experience. In Singapore alone, some
2,000 small undertakings come within the
orbit of an International Labour Organiza¬
tion-assisted programme to expand and
improve light industry, so as to open up
new sources of employment. This is im¬
portant for Singapore which is reported
to have the world's highest rate of popu¬
lation growth. Since it began operation
in 1963 the scheme has done much to
stimulate the use of modern techniques
in small-scale and handicraft industries.
EDUCATION INSTITUTE FOR REFUGEES:
A tripartite technical assistance agree¬
ment between Switzerland, the United Na¬
tions Relief and Works Agency for
Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) and Unesco
has paved the way for an institute of edu¬
cation that will benefit Palestine refugees.
The Swiss Government is providing
$368,000 which will cover most of the
cost of operating the institute for the first
two years. Under the agreement a large-
scale teaching training project will help
to raise teaching standards in the Palestine
refugee schools.

WATERA SCARCE COMMODITY: A
vast co-operative research pro¬
gramme comprising over 60 projects aimed
at learning more about water in a world
where it is becoming a scarce commodity
was approved by the Co-ordinating Coun¬
cil of the International Hydrological Decade
which met at Unesco House recently.
Plans include the setting up of stations
throughout the world to provide informa¬
tion needed for drawing up a global water
balance information at present lacking
for two-thirds of the world's surface.
TRAINING AND RESEARCH: The United
Nations recently set up an Institute of
Training and Research In New York. Its
principal role will be to train people from
the developing countries for service with
U.N. member governments and organiza¬
tions in the United Nations system. It
will also study major questions relating to
the promotion of economic and social deve¬
lopment and the maintenance of interna¬
tional peace and security.
ELECTRICITY FROM HOT WATER: An
electric power station operating on hot
underground water is being built at Ma-
khach Kala, near Baku in the Soviet Union.
This is not the first station of its type,
but is is the first to be built outside a
"volcanic" area, where superheated water
is found close to the surface. Engineers
at Makhach Kala had to drill down more
than 15,000 feet to tap the subterranean
sources which reach a temperature of
160 degrees C. The new station will supply
cheap electricity to a wide area.
