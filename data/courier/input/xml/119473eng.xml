◗ Photos by Christien Jaspars; Text by Albakaye Ousmane Kounta
Each year the people of the Malian town of Djenné put a new coating of adobe on their great
earthen mosque. A festival held to celebrate the occasion starts at dawn, at the end of Ramadan.
■
It was a feast day. The end of
Ramadan.The people of Djenné
gathered on the great square 
in front of the mosque for nine o’clock
prayers on this holy day.
The ritual drew to a close.The men
were sitting on the ground listening 
to the Imam’s sermon, spoken 
by the greatest griot (storyteller)1
a slim, alert man with a silver tongue.
His metallic voice roamed through 
the audience, seeming to probe their
reactions.
With his hands and his gaze, he took
the pulse of the crowd.
At the end of the sermon, his eagle
eye caught sight of the upraised staff of
the patriarch, who sharply struck the
ground with it three times. Everyone
listened to the sound in complete
silence.Then the storyteller prepared to
pass on the old chief’s words.
The storyteller listened to the words,
the sentences and the sounds, gathering
them for a moment in his ears, his heart
and his head.Then his tongue caressed
them, cleansed them, drew them out,
spun them, rinsed them and delivered
them to the gathering , purged of all
anguish and poison. For the spoken
word can be a pain that kills and a
dagger that scars for life.
He said:
That the north wind rises with every
dawn
And murmurs each day
And drains everything of water
That the waters of the two rivers
Flow eastward each day
He said:
That the walls have stopped weeping
That it’s time to heal
The wounds left by winter
They understood:
They turned towards the West
1. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Imam,like 
all important figures, often does not speak 
directly to the crowd but through an
intermediary, the griot.

Towards the temple of Tapama2
They called on the great fishermen
On the Karanyara3
On the Famenta
On the Kasaminta
Lords of the waves of night
On the Niomenta
On the Sininta
On the Tienda
Lords of the manatees and the

They went straight through the southern
gate and on to the one opposite, the
Sory gate, and then turned east to “the
Pond of Fresh Milk”.
There were the masons
The men who mark in the sand
With wooden hands
The magic formulas
That turn into lizards
And cling to the walls
Or doves amid
The pillars.
They went to talk
To those who slap the walls
With slabs of clay
Then they went to the place where 
the two rivers meet.
The little river, the Bani,
Pretty as a little sister.

The site of Djenné has been inhabited since 250
B.C. It has always been a commercial cross-
roads between the desert and the savannah, on
the tra n s - S a h a ran ca ravan routes which vehi-
cled the gold trade. From the 15th century on,
Djenné also became a centre for the spread of
Islam. Almost 2,000 traditional adobe houses
with Arab decoration have survived. They are
built on hillocks to escape flooding by the Bani
and Niger rivers during the rainy season. Djenné
was placed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List in
1988. ■

Mixed with powdery rice straw
Kneaded out of millet husks and bran
Bare feet trampled it.
Bare hands worked it.
They filled all the containers
with it
Using shovels and big dabas5
And hundreds of women and men
Formed a crowd that flowed
Towards the giant walls
Of the mosque of Djenné

They took the pillars by storm
As if to climb up to heaven
Carrying buckets and baskets
As if filled with milk and honey.
They splay out their feet
On boxwood sticks stuck in the wall
Their heads between the legs of their
neighbour
Willing hands 
Take the slabs of clay
Perched on the scaffolding
Like horsemen in the sky.
But often on this heady day
People have no time
To eat or drink
Without stopping, they make do
With sachets of milk
Meatballs
and boiled rice.
Clay is everywhere
Mud is everywhere
You are 
Coated with it
From head to foot.
With his soft hands
He caressed the minaret
With slabs of clay hurled up
from below.
His body moved gracefully back and

Like the wings of the Mandé pelican
Accompanied by the sobbing of the

Kara will not fall.

A heavy silence descended on the town, in fits and starts, in
torrents, in sobs. The drums, the tall drums, the balafons and
the flutes fell silent.
Only the voice of the town crier echoed over the roofs and
the minarets, announcing mealtime.The meal is holy and is

To raise the issue of culture today is to position oneself at the crossroads of two
forces, globalization and the persistence of national identity, that are both contra-
dictory and intertwined. Culture can no longer be developed without a basic,
existential, vital tension between the universal, the regional, the national and the local.
Although cultures remain anchored in their national contexts, it is increasingly hard
to believe that the traditional concepts of identity, people and nation are inviolable. Our
societies have never experienced such a widespread break with traditions that have
grown up over centuries.
But we must ask ourselves whether modern trends usually presented as possible
threats to these traditions, including that of the nation-state, might not turn out to be
fertile soil for culture, i.e. favourable to the coexistence of diversity.They might help to
avoid the two pitfalls of ordered cohesion and artificial uniformity.
The first arises from the hegemonic identity model being based on a single, total,
dominant, integrating culture. It was seen as something fixed and immutable. It was
brandished as a weapon, and we are only now beginning to measure its impact. The
twentieth century saw the most sophisticated cultures give in to barbarism. It took us a
long time to realize that racism flourishes where cultural identity is regarded as an abso-
lute. Cultures based on exclusion inevitably lead to the exclusion of all culture.That is
why the concept of cultural identity as we have known it since the beginning of globa-
lization is out of date.
But culture must not free itself from national identity by surrendering to the might
of globalization and privatization.Emerging post-national identities have not yet shown
their capacity to withstand inequality, injustice, exclusion and violence. To subordinate
culture to criteria developed in the laboratories of the dominant ideology, which make
a cult of the ups and downs of the stock market, the uncertainties of supply and
demand, the snares of functionality and urgency, is to cut off its vital supply of social
oxygen and to replace creative tension with the stress of the marketplace.
Two big dangers loom ahead.The first is the current tendency to relegate culture to
the status of a superfluous product, whereas cultural perception could well become for
information societies what scientific knowledge has been for industrial societies. It is
too often forgotten that repairing social divisions means having to pay a cultural cost.
Investing in culture is also investing in society.The second danger is that of “electronic
fundamentalism”. Cultural factories and supermarkets spread a culture that is so tech-
nology-oriented that it could be described as dehumanized.
But how can culture be “technologized” to the point where it is just a collection of
cultural clones, and still claim to be culture? A cloned culture is an aborted culture,
because when a culture ceases to be interdependent, it ceases to be a culture.
Interaction is the hallmark of culture. And interaction leads to hybridity, not cloning.
With cloning, the one is an exact copy of the other. With hybridity, the one and the
other give birth to a new entity which is different but also naturally retains the identity
of its origins. Wherever it has occurred, cultural hybridity has sustained roots and for-
ged new solidarities, which may be an antidote to exclusion.
To paraphrase André Malraux, I would say that the third millennium will be one of
hybridity or it will not be. ■

LA RGE DA MS — T HE END 
OF AN ERA ?
◗ Peter Coles
Growing debate about the rights and wrongs of large-scale dam construction focuses 
on the very meaning of development
■
At the last count,there were around
40,000 large dams on the wo r l d ’s
ri ve rs , according to the Intern at i o n a l
Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD).1
Most of them were built in the last 35 ye a rs.
A further 1,600 are under construction in
over 40 countri e s. But is the era of bu i l d i n g
ve ry large dams coming to an end? Pres-
sure groups of displaced rural communities
and ecology organizations have already dis-
rupted dam building in the United States
and India.
This coming August the independent
World Commission on Dams (WCD), set
up in 1998 by the World Bank and IUCN
(the World Conservation Union) to look at
the long term developmental effectiveness
of dams, will publish its conclusions after
t wo ye a rs of fa c t - fin d i n g . P r e l i m i n a ry
r e p o rts to the Commission, whose 12 com-
missioners span most groups of stakehol-
ders, are already suggesting that the deve-
lopment benefits may not be all they
p r o m i s e d . And that the people who gain
least from dams are those already at the
bottom of the socio-economic pile.
“Dams are both a technology option
and a development choice,” said South
A f rican Minister of Education and W C D
Chair Professor Kader Asmal last Decem-
ber. By focusing on dams as a reflection of
societal needs, he said,WCD is inevitably
confronting the very meaning of “develop-
m e n t ” . “ We are tackling the question of
h ow know l e d g e ,i n t e r e s t s , and values deter-
mine the context within which dams are
either chosen or rejected as the preferr e d
o p t i o n , and how such decisions can best be
n e g o t i ated between competing interests.”
Pa rt of W C D ’s remit is to find out what
these interests are. They might, f o r
1. ICOLD, founded in 1928, seeks to advance the
art and science of dams. It has some 6,000
individual members and National Committees in
80 countries. ICOLD defines a large dam as one
that is over 15 metres high.
On the rise: construction of a dam as part of the giant Three Gorges project on China’s Yangtze River.

e x a m p l e , include the needs of industry and
urban residents ve rsus agriculture and ru r a l
p o p u l at i o n s , o r , more cy n i c a l l y, the dam
i n d u s t ry ve rsus those interested in inter-
m e d i ate technology or traditional solutions
to development challenges.
For ICOLD, the links between dam
building and development are obvious.Two
prerequisites for the development of a
n ation are energy and wat e r , s ays one
ICOLD paper. But since these resources
are most scarce precisely where demand is
rising most rapidly, dams have become
almost synonymous with deve l o p m e n t .S o,
while dam building in developed countri e s
has slowed to a trickle in the last decade,
major constructions are underway in indus-
t rializing countri e s , like China’s massive
Three Gorges project and India’s Narm a d a
Valley Development project (see art i c l e
below). Over half of all large dams (more
than 22,000) are in China,while India has
become the third largest dam constructor
in the world,with over 3,000 large dams.
Smoothing
the flood-and-drought cycle
Although dams produce power without
c o n t ri buting to the greenhouse effect—
about 20 per cent of world electricity and
s e ven per cent of all energy, according to
ICOLD—their pri m a ry purpose is wat e r
c o n t r o l . R e s e rvo i rs can provide dri n k i n g
wat e r , while smoothing out the “boom and
bu s t ” cycles of flooding and drought
brought about by monsoons.They do this
by storing excess water in reservo i rs duri n g
the rainy season and releasing it in times of
s c a r c i t y. But by far the gr e atest use of dams
is to supply irri g ation water for agri c u l t u r e .
In developing countries, according to the
United Nations Environment Programme
( U N E P ) , i rri g ation accounts for over 75
per cent of water consumption. In some
countries,the figure is over 90 per cent.
At present, according to ICOLD, one
third of all food produced already comes
from irrigated land. And the organization
sees irrigation as the only way to meet the
future increase in demand, expecting 80
per cent of food production to come from
irrigated land by 2025.
But the case for irri g ation is far from
c l e a r - c u t . According to the Intern at i o n a l
Rivers Network (IRN),a non-governmen-
tal organizat i o n , i rri g ation canals cause
e u t r o p h i c at i o n2. M e a n w h i l e , the crops pro-
duced are often for export and do not feed
the sectors of the population that are
expanding most rapidly—the poor. A n d
2. Eutrophication is a phenomenon occurring in
stagnant water, whereby vegetation proliferates
and the water’s oxygen content is reduced.
i r o n i c a l l y, these are the ve ry people who
lose their homes, fa rms and live l i h o o d s
when river valleys are flooded by dams.
E ven before a dam has produced a single
watt of powe r , or litre of irri g ation wat e r ,
tens of thousands of people may need to be
e va c u ated from the ri ver valleys to make way
for the reservo i r. Wo r l d - w i d e , the flo o d e d
valleys that accompany large dams have for-
ced at least 30 million people to abandon
their homes since the 1930s, according to
I R N. In the past, g ove rnments have seen the
human cost of displacement as an inevitable
“side effect”of deve l o p m e n t .N ow these dis-
placed people are fighting to be heard.
“ Past experi e n c e s ,” s ays one report to the
C o m m i s s i o n ,“ s h ow that typical resettlement
p r o grammes are: often prepared late in the
project cy c l e ; under fin a n c e d ; devised using
i n s u f ficient understanding of people’s social,
c u l t u r a l ,e c o n o m i c, p s y c h o l o gical conditions
and environment in which they were loca-
t e d ; implemented with a ve ry short time
f r a m e , with limited objective of restoring pre-
vious income leve l s , and too often term i n at e d
e ven before all displaced people were resett-
led and rehabilitat e d .” One question that
WCD will be trying to answer in its fin a l
r e p o rt is whether the loss of an ancient ru r a l
lifestyle is the inevitable price a nation has to
p ay to achieve security for the majori t y.
Some of those opposed to large-scale
dam construction, like IRN, see the deve-
lopment that dams supposedly promote as
s p u rious in any case, e ven for the largely
urban communities who benefit . In its
publicity for Silent Rive rs, a book by Pat ri c k
McCully that IRN co-published, the NGO
s ays that “ m a s s i ve dams are much more
than simply machines to generate electri c i t y
and store wat e r. They are concrete, r o c k
and earth expressions of the dominant
ideology of the technological age: icons of
economic development and scientific pro-
gress to match nuclear bombs and motor
cars.”
Other critics suggest that the dam
i n d u s t ry simply turned to developing coun-
t ries because the market in deve l o p e d
countries had almost dried up. In the past,
loans from the World Bank and internatio-
nal aid programmes indirectly kept the
multi-billion dollar industry aflo at , w h i l e
s c o ring lucrat i ve trade and technology
transfer deals for the lending nations. But
n ow, under mounting opposition from
pressure groups,the U.S.and many Euro-
pean gove rnments have declined to become
involved in projects like the Three Gorges
and Narmada dams.
With power still mainly in the hands of
the dam builders,the coming WCD report
might at least provide guidelines on how to
include the dispossessed among those who
b e n e fit , while minimizing the extent of irr e-
versible damage. ■

c o n s t ruction moves slowly ahead on the 30
large dams, 150 medium and 3,000 smaller
dams in a vast project that will transform
the Narmada into a staircase of reservoirs
and turbines. For the past 15 ye a rs , t h e
backlash of opposition from NBA, a
coalition of local people’s move m e n t s
opposed to the different dams, has been
challenging the view of development that
these dams promote. NBA argues that the
b e n e fic i a ries of the project will be city dwe l-
l e rs , not the rural communities forced to
leave their homes in the flooded valley.
O ver 80 per cent of India’s rural house-
holds have no electricity—and little hope of
e ver being connected to the electricity gri d —
according to A ru n d h ati Roy, the acclaimed
Indian author who has recently championed
N B A ’s stru g g l e . She says the increased food
t h at the dams’i rri g ation canals may produce
will be destined for export , doing little to feed
the nat i o n ’s poor. In 1995, she say s , some 30
million tons of unsold grain were stockpiled
in state gr a n a ri e s , while 350 million Indians
still live below the pove rty line.W h at is more,
most of the people affected by the Narm a d a
p r o j e c t , s ays NBA, are tribal communities,
fishing villages and Dalits (the so-called
“ o p p r e s s e d ”l ower stratum of the Hindu caste
s y s t e m ) , who already benefit least from
I n d i a ’s prosperi t y.
The notion of dam building as a pri m e
technology solution to development is not
n e w. Back in the 1940s, just after Indepen-
d e n c e ,P rime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru saw
dams as “the Temples of Modern India”.T h e
N a rmada Valley Development Project wa s
to be a showcase for this vision.Although this
p a rticular project stayed on the draw i n g
board for over 30 ye a rs , mostly because of
disputes over water rights between the three
s t at e s — M a d hya Pradesh, Maharashtra and
G u j a r at—through which the Narmada flow s ,
India went on to build some 3,600 dams.
Coupled to the Green Revolution of the
1 9 6 0 s , these dams provided massive irri-
g ation systems that have underpinned a
fourfold increase in food production.And
similar prospects are being heralded for the
N a rmada dams. According to offic i a l
fig u r e s , the Sardar Sarovar dam, the last
and largest of the dams before the ri ve r
reaches the Arabian Sea, will provide wat e r
for 20-30 million people all year round,
especially in the arid areas of Kutch, Sau-
rashtra and the state of Rajasthan. At the
same time, the 138.6-metre multi-purp o s e
dam is scheduled to produce 1,450 MW of
hy d r o e l e c t ric powe r , while its reservo i r
should smooth out the yearly seesaw of
floods and droughts, protecting some
400,000 people.
World Bank withdrawal
NBA contests just about all the official
statistics on the future benefits of the pro-
ject. It also questions the very principle of
the dams from the point of view of deve-
lopment.Led by Medha Patkar,a sociolo-
gist originally from Bombay, NBA argues
that the benefits will never justify the irre-
versible loss of forest, fisheries, farmland,
culture and livelihood for the hundreds of
T HE RE A L I T IES OF RESETT L EMEN T
In some cases resettlement has meant the frag-
mentation of village communities, beca u s e
neighbours are given land in different sites.
Meanwhile, over 5,000 oustees from villages in
Gujarat are being rehoused in settlements along-
side others from Mahara s h t ra and Madhya Pra-
desh. People from three different states, each with
their own languages and dialects, culinary habits
and dress, are thrown together.
Resettled people may also have to face hostility
from their host communities. New lands can be
barren rocky ground or waterlogged, saline
stretches where farming is impossible. Fishing com-
munities find themselves far from the river on
which their livelihood has depended for centuries.
Often, these resettled people try to return to their
original homes, even if all that remains is a muddy
hilltop.
U n c e r t a i n ty is another dimension of resettle-
ment. Entire generations grow up not know i n g
what the ultimate fate of their village will be. As
NBA activist Shripad Dharmadhikari explains,
“when it is announced that an area will face sub-
mergence, all development work comes to a halt.
So if a school is being built or roads are being
constructed it is all stopped. The actual submer-
gence may remain on paper but the work stops.” In
the village of Kakarana Behena, a Bhillala tribes-
man said the electric supply to his village was cut
when its status as a submergence village became
known. Power supply was stopped a year ago but
the waters are still below Kakarana.
There are also social ra m i fications. Sulgaon is a
village in the prosperous and fertile Nimad region
that will be submerged when the Maheshwar dam
in Madhya Pradesh is constructed. Lakshman Pa t i-
dar says it is becoming increasingly difficult to fin d
brides for eligible boys. “Who will want to send their
daughters to a home that will soon be under water?”
he asks. And, like other Nimadi farmers, Pa t i d a r
values his land above all else. Since boys invariably
join their fathers on the farm they get little formal
e d u cation. This will make it even harder to adapt to
their loss of livelihood and culture. ■

thousands of displaced people. Some 30
million people depend directly or indirectly
on the 1,312-km-long river and its valley,
with its fertile fa rm l a n d , h i s t o ric temples
and pilgrimage routes.
In 1986, a year after the World Bank lent
$450 million to construct Sardar Sarova r ,
NBA commissioned a series of impact
assessment studies that , it claims, e x p o s e d
c rucial flaws in the official cost-benefit ana-
lyses for the entire project.But at the heart of
N B A ’s campaign is the apparent lack of
resettlement provision for oustees. W i t h
mounting intern ational support , NBA wa s
able to force a review of the Narmada pro-
j e c t . In 1991 the World Bank commissioned
an independent inquiry,whose report essen-
tially endorsed the NBA claims, s aying that
there had been “no proper appraisal” of the
p r o j e c t ’s impact. Two ye a rs lat e r , in an
unprecedented about-turn , the World Bank
withdrew from the scheme.
In 1994, I n d i a ’s Supreme Court upheld
a case presented by NBA, freezing all
construction on the Narmada dams until
the state gove rnments carried out adequat e
impact assessments.NBA insists that there
must be no displacement if there are no
realistic plans for resettlement. With the
exception of Sardar Sarova r , none of the
dam projects had any resettlement plans,
s ays the organizat i o n . NBA is adamant that
it is not opposed to the development that
the dams promise. It is also looking for a
compromise solution, calling for the final
height of the dams to be reduced.The lowe r
the final height, the fewer people will be
forced to move to make way for the reser-
voirs and the less land will be lost.
Rally in the valley
Although it now seems unlikely that
N B A ’s actions will stop the dams, the orga-
nization has brought the issue of resettle-
ment to the fore.In 1998 the Madhya Pra-
desh gove rnment set up a task force to look
at resettlement possibilities. It found that
not only was there no land in Madhya Pra-
desh to house oustees but that the land pro-
mised by Gujarat either did not exist, o r
was of too poor quality. Madhya Pradesh
has now called for a new eva l u at i o n .T h e
s t ate of Gujarat , h owe ve r , has dug in its
h e e l s. Not only did it refuse to allow the
independent World Commission on Dams,
set up by the World Bank (see page 10), to
visit the Sardar Sarovar site, it also challen-
ged the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling.In
Fe b ru a ry 1999, after a four-year morat o-
rium,the Supreme Court reversed its ear-
lier decision, a l l owing construction to begi n
again at Sardar Sarovar,adding a further 5
metres to the 80 metres already built.
NBA has now reinforced its stru g g l e ,
organizing a series of passive sit-ins and
hunger strikes. At the end of July last year
A ru n d h ati Roy organized a “Rally in the
Va l l e y ” , marching with 400 other public
figures and supporters from village to vil-
lage in the affected area. An estimat e d
10,000 oustees joined the rally in the fert i l e
Nimad region of Madhya Pradesh, where
the local fa rm e rs will lose their land if
c o n s t ruction goes ahead. And when the
monsoon rains began in August 1999,
Medha Patkar and other NBA members
took up positions in the village of Dom-
khedi,refusing to move as the flood waters
rose up to their shoulders. Police in boats
finally removed them. At the end of last
ye a r , A ru n d h ati Roy published a closely-
documented essay entitled “The Great e r
Common Good” in Outlook m a g a z i n e ,c ri-
ticizing the Narmada Valley project both in
principle and in its application.
As the mud flies between NBA and
s u p p o rt e rs of the project, the withdrawa l
of the World Bank could have unpredic-
table effects in the longer term.With most
i n t e rn ational aid programmes now
unwilling to be associated with the dams,
the deve l o p e rs are looking for pri vate sector
f u n d i n g . This could be much harder to
i n fluence than an institution such as the
World Bank, which has a “ wo rt hy ” image to
protect. ■

Ten ye a rs ago, a commercial revo l u t i o n
began in U. S .c l a s s r o o m s.After a 1989
test ru n , Channel One debuted in the
spring of 1990 in 400 secondary schools
across the country. It was the brainchild of
Christopher Whittle,a brash media entre-
preneur from Tennessee who had built an
empire by dreaming up new ways to expose
Americans to advertising and marketing.
“Were this a perfect world, we would
agree that government, not commercials,
should provide this technology and pro-
gr a m m i n g,”M r.Whittle said at the time. H e
frequently quipped that students believed
“ C h e rnobyl is Cher’s full name”—proof
that they were in dire need of relevant cur-
rent-events programming.
Channel One wa s n ’t the first case of
a d ve rtising in the schools.A m e rican students
were accustomed to seeing athletic score-
boards sponsored by Coca-Cola or Pe p s i ,
a d ve rtisements in ye a r b o o k s , and newspaper-
i n - e d u c ation progr a m m e s. But the daily class-
room news show for teenagers was something
d i f f e r e n t , and it caused quite a stir.The basic
offer was this: Channel One provided schools
with a satellite dish, a videotape recorder,
w i ri n g,and a television monitor in each class-
room to show the 12-minute daily pro-
gr a m m e , which includes two minutes of
a d ve rt i s i n g . Schools signed a contract gua-
ranteeing that they would show Channel One
to most students virtually eve ry school day.
12,000 schools
The schools could use the in-school
video network for other purposes, such as
producing their own local student news
s h ow s , or to run educational documentari e s.
Critics called it a bargain with the devil.
Schools were ceding control of a small part
of their class time, and providing adve rt i s e rs
with access to students’ attention in unpre-
cedented fashion, they said.
Many educators did fight the concept.
V i rtually eve ry major education group in the
◗ In a venture modeled somewhat after
Channel One, a California company called
ZapMe! Corp. p r ovides schools with a pac-
kage of free computers and an Intern e t
connection as long as they agree to have stu-
dents use them at least four hours a day.
ZapMe! carries adve rtising targeted at stu-
d e n t s.
United States passed resolutions opposing
Channel One. Some states, such as New
York, banned it outright in public schools
while others threatened to withhold school
funding for the two minutes per day schools
gave over to advertisers.
But at the time, the United States was in
the throes of an education reform move m e n t
t h at favoured decentralized control and
school-based decision-making. And many
local school boards and school pri n c i p a l s
decided they would accept the video equip-
m e n t . Some found the news show inform a-
t i ve at a time when few teenagers picked up
a newspaper or tuned into network television
n e w s.And the commercials were rarely dif-
ferent from the ones students saw thousands
of times watching television at home.
Before long, Whittle Communications
had wired some 12,000 schools,and eight
million students in U.S. middle and high
schools were watching Channel One daily.
Although Channel One became profit a b l e ,
the classroom news show couldn’t save Mr.
W h i t t l e ’s crumbling media empire. He sold
Channel One in 1994 to K-III Communi-
c ations Corp. ,n ow known as Primedia Inc.
M e a n w h i l e , with the ground broken by
Channel One, A m e rican companies and
advertisers have come up with many new
f o rms of commercial messages in and
around schools:
◗ Major soda bottlers such as Pepsi and
Coca-Cola vie for exclusive beve r a g e
contracts with school districts,so they can
place logo-laden soda machines on cam-
puses and share revenue with the schools.
◗ Ti m e and N e w swe e k magazines and
The New York Times publish special news-
magazines for elementary and secondary
school classrooms, most of which carry
advertising.
◗ A mat h e m atics workbook published
by McGraw - H i l l , a major textbook publisher,
caused a stir last year because of its use of
product trade names and logos in word pro-
b l e m s. The publisher said it was trying to
make the texts more relevant to students.◗ Associate editor, Education Week (USA)

Channel One’s news content comes in
for heavy scru t i ny. The tone of its daily
s h ow has see-sawed over the ye a rs betwe e n
an emphasis on hard news and seri o u s
topics and what some educat o rs deri d e d
as a too light, pop culture orientation. In
recent ye a rs ,h owe ve r , the show has empha-
sized social issues of interest to teenagers
and world report s.“I think that if you we n t
back to the early 1990s what you wo u l d
h ave seen is more of a headline approach,”
said Paul Fo l k e m e r , Channel One’s exe-
cutive vice president for education. “Our
present strategy has a more in-depth look,
with more of a teaching side to it.”
The January 4, 2000, programme was
fairly typical. Fresh into the new millen-
nium, Channel One offered an extended
r e p o rt on the surp rise resignation of Russian
President Boris Ye l t s i n . It interv i e we d
n ational security experts and dug up video
of a 1997 visit to Russia by its own corres-
p o n d e n t , including shots of Russian citizens
selling their belongings in the streets. O t h e r
elements of the day’s show included a pop
quiz, a regular feature designed to engage
students in the classroom, a report about the
conclusion of an airliner hijacking in India,
and two commercial breaks. Among the
a d ve rtisements on this day were one for
J u i cy Fruit gum and two “public serv i c e
a n n o u n c e m e n t s ” : an anti-drug message
and one wa rning young people about poten-
tial dangers on the Internet.
“I have a role eve ry day in the discussion
of what we are going to air. I ’ ve tried to link
all of our materials to national education
s t a n d a r d s ,” explains Dr. Fo l k e m e r , a form e r
school principal. Dr. Folkemer considers
himself Channel One’s equivalent of a

used.The United States has no federally
m a n d ated curriculum standards, but gr o u p s
for virtually all school subjects have deve-
loped vo l u n t a ry standards. D r. Folkemer has
emphasized several initiat i ves that show up
on Channel One. Teaching the News, f o r
e x a m p l e , helps educat o rs identify which
subjects the Channel One news report will
relate to on a given day.
Another initiat i ve is The Power of One,
which includes a series of stories that stress
the difference that one individual can make.
Last Nove m b e r , for example, Channel One
f e atured a V i r ginia high school student who
s t a rted a project to raise money to prov i d e

Channel One, and some observe rs gi ve the
n e t work credit for its emphasis on wo r l d
n e w s. In 1998, B ri l l ’s Content, a nat i o n a l
magazine of media cri t i c i s m , lauded Channel
One for providing a more substantive report
on the Indonesian political crises than NBC
Nightly News, one of the major nat i o n a l
news progr a m m e s , did on the same day.
But William Hoy n e s , a professor of socio-
logy at Vassar College, c riticizes the news
c o n t e n t .An analysis of 36 programmes found
t h at only about 20 per cent of airtime wa s
d e voted to coverage of news stori e s , with the
rest of the time filled with a news quiz, we a-
t h e r , s p o rts and Hollywood gossip. H i s
r e s e a r c h , conducted with a media expert ,
concluded that the channel’s “real function
is not journalistic but commercial.” H oy n e s
also criticizes the channel’s reporting style.
“The anchors are cast as adve n t u r e rs who tra-
vel the world for a good story,” he said. “ I t
focuses the news and the drama on the indi-
vidual personalities instead of the issues and
e ve n t s. . .Channel One news serves as a pro-
motional vehicle for itself and for youth cul-
ture and style,”H oynes added.This approach,
not incidentally, promotes a friendly env i-
ronment for adve rt i s i n g,he believe s.
Reaching 
the teen market
Without a doubt, the presence of adve rt i s i n g
remains the most controve rsial aspect of
Channel One.The advertising debate had
appeared to quieten down until early 1999,
when several prominent A m e rican conser-
vat i ves joined with longtime liberal critics of
commercialism in schools. This coalition
successfully lobbied a U. S . S e n ate com-
mittee to hold an ove rsight hearing on
school commercialism that was focused
almost entirely on Channel One.
Although there was no serious prospect
of federal legislation on the issue,the May
1999 hearing was nevertheless a dramatic
c o n f r o n t ation between Channel One’s pro-
ponents and its legion of critics. Despite
their decision to co-operat e , liberals and
conservatives have distinct concerns. The
latter tend to focus on the contents of the
programme, objecting to a variety of pop
culture references such as a riff of music
from the shock rocker Marilyn Manson or
ads for R-rate movies, restricted because
they contain sex or violence. P hyllis Schlafly,
the president of the Eagle Fo ru m , and a pro-
minent conservat i ve activist, called Channel
One a “devious device to enable adve rt i s e rs
to circumvent parents.”
The liberal attack on Channel One is
from the perspective of consumers versus
advertisers and big business, arguing that
c o rp o r ate adve rt i s e rs should not be able to
buy access to children’s minds in school
and that public schools should not abdicat e
control of class time to commercial interests.
Ralph Nader, an A m e rican liberal icon,
called Channel One “the most brazen mar-
keting ploy in the history of the United
S t at e s.” The programme conveys a mes-
sage of mat e ri a l i s m ,M r. Nader said, and it
“ c o rrupts the integrity of schools and
d e grades the moral authority of schools
and teachers.” A year ago, C o m m e r c i a l
A l e rt , a consumer organization affil i at e d
with Mr. N a d e r , wrote to all the major
a d ve rt i s e rs on Channel One, u r ging them to
end their sponsorship of the show.
The letters cited four main concern s :
Channel One forces children to watch the
a d s ; it wastes valuable class time (in 1998,
t wo researchers asserted that the two minutes
of time devoted to commercials in Channel
O n e ’s 12,000 schools was costing those
schools some $300 million in lost time); i t
wastes taxpaye rs ’d o l l a rs for educat i o n ;a n d
its content is under the control of its produ-
c e rs and not of parents or elected school
b o a r d s. Most adve rt i s e rs did not eve n
respond to the letter, much less agree to
drop their adve rt i s i n g . One company that did
respond was Nabisco, which has adve rt i s e d
Bubble Yum gum on the show.“Our decision
to adve rtise on Channel One was made only
after a thorough review of the progr a m m i n g
and its benefits to schools and school chil-
d r e n ,” the company wrote to Commercial
A l e rt .“ We do not believe evidence support s
the charge that two minutes of daily adve r-
tising is putting our children’s future at ri s k .”
A d ve rt i s e rs such as Nabisco, Pe p s i ,
Proctor & Gamble (with ads for Clearasil
skin cream and Pringles potato chips),
movie studios and the U.S.Armed Forces
(for recruitment) pay premium rates (up to
$200,000 for a 30-second spot) to reach
Channel One’s audience of eight million
s t u d e n t s. As the channel’s adve rt i s e m e n t
to media bu ye rs puts it, the show “is viewe d
by more teens than any other programme
on television.” Another industry adve rt i s e-
ment refers to the channel as “the smart e s t
place to reach twe e n s.”Tweens is a Madison
Avenue term for children 9-14 years old, a
coveted demographic group. “Many chil-
dren and especially teens are difficult for
a d ve rt i s e rs to reach,” said Gary Ruskin,
the director of Commercial Alert. “So the
product hawkers are going where the kids
are—where they are forced to be, in school.”
New outlets
Channel One exe c u t i ves paint the adve rt i s i n g
c ritics as a loud but small group that is pushing
tired old arguments.“I don’t know of anyo n e
who is an advo c ate of simply commercia-
l i s m ,” said Andy Hill,Channel One’s president
of progr a m m i n g .“The debate has been about
t wo minutes of adve rtising and not about 10
minutes of good progr a m m i n g . Our cri t i c s
tend not to be people in schools.”R oy Lewis,
a teacher in Californ i a , a s s e rted that “ w h at
Channel One does so beautifully is prov i d e
b a c k gr o u n d .”But critics point out that there
are other ways of bri n ging news into the
s c h o o l :CNN has developed an ad-free news-
cast for the classroom, but the cable stat i o n
does not offer schools the equipment to go
along with it.
N ow Channel One’s journalism is
m oving beyond the classroom. It recently
began submitting twice-monthly reports to
a morning television news show on CBS
t e l e v i s i o n . It has similar projects in the wo r k s
for the MTV cable channel and a new
wo m e n ’s cable network called Oxygen.
Channel One is developing a media literacy
c u rriculum for schools, and its we b s i t e ,w h i c h
has long supplemented the TV show with
additional inform at i o n ,q u i z z e s , and the like,
is getting an infusion of spending.
P ri m e d i a , which publishes such maga-
zines as S e ve n t e e n, Soap Opera Dige s t, a n d
A u t o m o b i l e, does not disclose revenues for
Channel One. But Simba Inform ation Inc. ,
which tracks spending on educational media,
e s t i m ates that Channel One and a sister unit
t h at sells documentaries to schools had reve-
nues of $118.5 million in 1999.
Primedia recently sold off some of its
e d u c ational propert i e s , including the ve n e-
rable A m e rican classroom magazine, M y
Weekly Reader.There has been speculation
that the company wanted to divest itself of
Channel One as we l l , but the company has
a new chief executive officer,Tom Rogers,
who came from the NBC television net-
wo r k . M r. R o g e rs seems to be intent on
keeping Channel One and fitting it into a
media future in which television, t h e
I n t e rn e t , and education are expected to
merge in new forms. ■

From time immemorial,languages have come to
b i r t h , lived and died with the societies that
engendered them.To d a y, h o w e v e r, they are dying
out at unprecedented speed.As a result of what have
been called “language wa r s ” , the great majority of
the 6,000 languages spoken in the world today may
disappear in the foreseeable future. Linguistic diversity
is imperilled, and with it a part of the human heritage,
for language is the cornerstone of cultural diversity,
which is in its turn a mainstay in the preservation of
biodiversity (pages 18-19).
There are many reasons for language wars in which
English at the world level (pages 23-24) and other
“ m a j o r ” regional languages gain ground at the
expense of “minority” languages. But the big batta-
lions do not always win,as the struggles to preserve
Basque, Berber and Gikuyu illustrate (pages 24-28).
At the same time, coexistence between languages
can and is being fostered (page 29). Through interna-
tional co-operation to promote multilingualism, e s p e-
cially in education (pages 30-31); through specific natio-
nal policies, as in India (pages 33-34); and through
grassroots initiatives like that of the Ecuadorian Shuar,
who have used the rebirth of their language as a spring-
board into the modern world (pages 32-33).
Also in Ecuador, the story of the Zaparo (pages 19
and 22) shows the other side of the coin.The Zaparo
did not mobilize until late in the day, and their lan-
guage now seems doomed to disappear and with it
their very existence as an ethnic group. As the last
article in this Focus section reveals (pages 35-36),the
fate of a language depends ultimately on the commit-
ment of its users. M e a n w h i l e, the disappearance of
minority languages may be accompanied by the emer-
gence of new hybrid tongues or variants spawned by
the diversification of dominant languages. ■

Are the vast majority of languages doomed
to die out in the near future? Specialists
reckon that no language can surv i ve
unless 100,000 people speak it. Half of the
6,000 or so languages in the world today are
spoken by fewer than 10,000 people and a quar-
ter by less than 1,000. Only a score are spoken
by hundreds of millions of people.
The death of languages is not a new pheno-
m e n o n . Since languages dive rs i fie d , at least
30,000 (some say as many as half a million) of
them have been born and disappeared, often
without leaving any trace.Languages usually have
a relatively short life span as well as a very high
d e ath rat e . Only a few, including Basque,
E g y p t i a n , C h i n e s e , G r e e k , H e b r e w, L at i n ,
Persian, Sanskrit and Tamil, have lasted more
than 2,000 years.
Minority languages
sidelined
What is new, however, is the speed at which
they are dying out. Europe’s colonial conquests
caused a sharp decline in linguistic diversity, eli-
minating at least 15 per cent of all languages spo-
ken at the time. Over the last 300 years, Europe
has lost a dozen, and Australia has only 20 left of
the 250 spoken at the end of the 18th century. In
Brazil, about 540 (three-quarters of the total)
h ave died out since Po rtuguese colonizat i o n
began in 1530.
The rise of nation-states, whose territorial
unity was closely linked to their linguistic homo-
geneity, has also been decisive in selecting and
consolidating national languages and sidelining
others. By making great efforts to establish an
official language in education, the media and the
civil service, national governments have delibera-
tely tried to eliminate minority languages.
This process of linguistic standardization has
been boosted by industrialization and scientific
progress, which have imposed new methods of
communication that are swift, straightforward
and practical. Language diversity came to be seen

as an obstacle to trade and the spread of know-
ledge. Monolingualism became an ideal, and at
the end of the 19th century the notion of a uni-
versal language was born—a return to Latin was
even considered—which gave rise to a spate of
a rt i ficial languages, the first of which wa s
Volapük. The one that gained the widest accep-
tance and has survived longest is Esperanto.
More recently, the intern at i o n a l i z ation of
financial markets, the dissemination of informa-
tion by electronic media and other aspects of glo-
balization have intensified the threat to “small”
languages. A language not on the Internet is a lan-
guage that “no longer exists” in the modern
world. It is out of the game.It is not used in busi-
ness.
The rate of language extinction has now rea-
ched the unprecedented worldwide level of 10
every year. Some people predict that 50 to 90 per
cent of today’s spoken languages will disappear
during this century. Their preservation is an
urgent matter.
The effects of the death of languages are
serious for several reasons. First of all, it is pos-
sible that if we all ended up speaking the same
language, our brains would lose some of their
natural capacity for linguistic inventiveness. We
would never be able to plumb the origins of

human language or resolve the mystery of “the
first language”. As each language dies, a chapter
of human history closes .
Multilingualism is the most accurate reflec-
tion of multiculturalism. The destruction of the
first will inevitably lead to the loss of the second.
Imposing a language without any links to a peo-
ple’s culture and way of life stifles the expression
of their collective genius. A language is not only
the main instrument of human communication.
It also expresses the world vision of those who
speak it, their imagination and their ways of using
knowledge.
Dying whispers
of traditional cultures
To grasp how differently each tongue reflects
the world, one only needs to list the words that
crop up in every language with exactly the same
meaning, words like I, you, us, who, what, no, all,
one, two, big, long, small, woman, man, eat, see,
hear, sun, moon, star, water, fire, hot,cold, white,
black, night, land. There are about 300 at the
most.
The threat to multilingualism is similar to the
threat to biodiversity. Not just because most lan-
guages are like disappearing “species”, but becau-
se there is an intrinsic and causal link between
biological diversity and cultural diversity. Like
‘M y name is Manari , which in my lan-

obliged to put down Spanish names. So I’m also

knew the medicinal secrets of more than 500

plant and animal species, endangered languages
are confined to small areas. More than 80 per
cent of countries that have great biological diver-
sity are also places with the greatest number of
endemic languages. This is because when people
adapt to their environment, they create a special
stock of knowledge about it which is mirrored in
their language and often only there. Many of the
world’s endangered plant and animal species
today are known only to certain peoples whose
languages are dying out. As they die, they take
with them all the traditional knowledge about the
environment.
The 1992 Rio Earth Summit set up machine-
ry to combat shrinking biodiversity. Now it is
time for a Rio summit to tackle languages. The
need to protect languages began to be apprecia-
ted in the middle of the 20th century, when lan-
guage rights were included in the Unive rs a l
Declaration of Human Rights (article 2). Since
then, a number of instruments have been adop-
ted, and projects have been launched (see pages
30-31) to safeguard what is now considered a
heritage of humanity. These laws and initiatives
may not prevent languages from dying out, but at
least they will slow down the process and encou-
rage multilingualism. ■

the decline of the Zaparo—settlers, disease, the
rubber boom, slavery, wars, oil drilling and “the
modern world”.
“When the white rubber traders came to our
f o r e s t ,” s ays Manari , “they took away our people to
work as slaves and to sell them off like chat t e l s.
They also brought with them diseases that our sha-
mans didn’t know how to cure. So most of our
people died.”
“The Zaparo are officially extinct in this
c o u n t ry,” announced an article published in
Ecuador nearly 10 ye a rs ago. But today they are still
fighting to surv i ve , though the number of threats are
more than they can count—in their language, n u m-
bers only go up to three.

ago asking the cultural attaché at Ecuador’s embassy in
Peru to intervene so that the Ecuadorian Zaparo could

Linguistic densities
Wi n n e rs a n d
l o s e rs
Half the world’s population uses a total of eight
languages in daily life, while one sixth of the world’s
languages are spoken in New Guinea alone 
T he linguistic heritage is very unevenly distri-
buted. According to estimates made by the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), w h i c h
campaigns for preservation of the least-know n
t o n g u e s , only three per cent of the wo r l d ’s 6,000 lan-
guages are used in Europe, whereas half of them are
spoken in the A s i a - Pa c i fic regi o n , with the top pri z e
going to New Guinea (the Indonesian territory of
I rian Jaya plus Papua New Guinea), which is home
to one sixth of the world’s languages.
Linguistic dive rsity does not match populat i o n
d e n s i t y : 96 per cent of languages are spoken by
only four per cent of the wo r l d ’s population and ove r
80 per cent are endemic, i . e . confined to one
country. Only about 20 languages are spoken by
hundreds of millions of people in several countri e s.
Although the figures va ry according to the
method of counting, the Millennium Family Ency-
c l o p a e d i a (Dorling Kinders l e y, L o n d o n ,1 9 9 7 ) ,e s t i-
mates that around half the people in the world use
in eve ry d ay life one of the planet’s eight most wides-
pread languages: Chinese (1.2 billion speakers ) ,
English (478 million), Hindi (437 million), S p a n i s h
(392 million),Russian (284 million), Arabic (225
m i l l i o n ) , Po rtuguese (184 million) and French (125
million). SIL and Linguasphere Observatory (see
page 31) provide comparable figures,by adding to
those who speak a language as a mother tongue
those for whom it is a “second language”. (see p. 2 1 ) .
Ten languages 
die out every year
This imbalance leads specialists to forecast that
95 per cent of all living languages will die out duri n g
the next century. At present,10 languages disappear
e ve ry year somewhere in the wo r l d . Some go so fa r
as to claim a language dies out eve ry two we e k s.T h e
r ate of disappearance is especially high in areas
where linguistic diversity is greatest.
In Africa,more than 200 languages have fewer
than 500 speakers each and may soon die out.The
minimum number of speakers to ensure surv i val is
put at 100,000.
In North A m e ri c a , the biggest threats are to
indigenous and Creole languages.With the excep-
tions of Navajo, Cree and Ojibwa, the 200 Ame-
rindian tongues which have surv i ved until now in the
United States and Canada are endangered.
B e t ween a third and a half of Latin A m e ri c a ’s
500 A m e rindian languages are in danger, with the
highest rate of extinction predicted in Brazil,
where most languages are spoken by ve ry small
c o m m u n i t i e s.
The languages of Southeast Asia are each spoken
by relat i vely large numbers of people, and the future
of about 40 of the 600 to 700 languages there will
depend largely on government policies.
On the other hand, only six languages out of
n o rth-east A s i a ’s 47 have any real chance of surv i va l
in the face of Russian.Twenty are “nearly extinct”,
eight are “ s e riously endangered”and 13 are “ e n d a n-
g e r e d ” .The first group are spoken by only a dozen
people at most.The second group are more widely
used but are not being passed down to children.T h e
third cat e g o ry includes tongues spoken by some chil-
dren but fewer and fewer, according to the forth-
coming UN E S C O Red Book on Endangered Lan-
guages:Europe and North-east Asia.
In Europe, where the number of languages
varies by a factor of two according to the criteria
used to define them, 123 languages are spoken,
including nine which are nearly extinct, 26 seri o u s l y
endangered and 38 endangered, according to the
UNESCO book. ■

My language, m y
precious adornment.
F rom a Maori poster 
(New Zealand)
For the last three years young Zaparo led by
Manari and supported by the Pastaza Indigenous
Peoples’ Organization (OPIP) have been engaged
in a battle to save their culture and traditional way
of life as hunters and gatherers. They have three
main objectives: to keep alive the Zaparo langua-
ge, to clearly mark out Zaparo territory and to
arrange a meeting with Zaparo who live over the
border in Peru.The results so far have not been
very encouraging.
The last shaman
They have not been able to meet their Pe ru v i a n
k i n s f o l k , from whom they have been separated since
a war between Ecuador and Pe ru nearly 60 ye a rs
a g o.The journey can take a month when the ri ver is
l ow and up to three months during a flo o d . It wa s
only a couple of months ago that someone gave the
Zaparo a small motor-boat . D i p l o m atic contacts
would also have to be made to enable the Ecuadori a n
Zaparo to journey into disputed terri t o ry.
“ We ’re Ecuadori a n s ,” s ays Manari , “ but once
upon a time the Zaparo were a single people living
in a single forest. So we ’re not used to getting per-
mission to cross borders or search for our people.”
The plan is for a group of four children, alrea-
dy chosen, to go and meet the shamans on the
Peruvian side who will teach them their methods.
This is crucial if the community is to survive,
because when the last shaman died three years
ago, the Zaparo lost their only source of knowled-
ge about their traditions, the healing power of
plants and the secrets of the jungle. “Since my
father died, there’s been no one to look after us,
and many people are ill and dying,” says Manari.
Traditional knowledge and the remedies of
shamans can only be handed down through lan-
guage. Preserving the Zaparo language is more
than just a cultural matter. The physical survival
of the community itself is at stake. And the plan
to save it is a race against time because only five
very old people still speak Zaparo and they live
several days’ journey from each other. One of
them is Sasiko Takiauri, who was born about 70
years ago on the banks of the Conambo. “In those
days,” he says, “everyone spoke Zaparo. I didn’t
learn Quechua until I was 18.”
The story of Zaparo is similar to that of other
indigenous languages in the Ecuadorian-Peruvian
region. Zaparo forms part of the Zaparoan lin-
guistic group, together with Arabela, Iquito and
Taushniro, and is related to other languages that
have already disappeared (Konambo, Gae and
Andoa).It gave way to Quechua relatively recent-
ly. It was about 60 years ago, according to Sasiko,
that the Zaparo began identifying with the cultu-
re of the Quechua Indians through frequent tra-
ding with the Quechua village of Sarayacu.
These days, Sasiko’s grandchildren and great-
grandchildren who live in the Zaparo villages of
Llanchama, Cocha, Jandia Yacu and Mazaramu,
are taught Quechua and Spanish under a bilin-
gual curriculum decreed by the government.The
teachers, secondary school graduates who do not
originate from the villages where they teach, are
paid $4 a month and openly say they will leave
the region as soon as they can. Most of their
pupils do not speak Spanish and learn Quechua
almost entirely in oral form.
“ We don’t like asking for help,” s ays Manari ,
“ but since there are now only a few of us left, we ’r e
afraid it’s the end of the road.” M e a n w h i l e , the old
f o l k , led by Sasiko, are once again giving children
names in the ve rnacular—such as Newa , To a r o,
Mukutzagua (Pa rt ri d g e , Pa rr o t , O riole)—to show
the world the Zaparo have not died out. ■

v o i c e, I shall be unto

b a r b a r i a n , and he that
s p e a keth shall be a
barbarian unto me.

B ack in 1919, U. S . President Wo o d r ow
Wilson managed to have the Treaty of
Versailles,which ended the First World War
b e t ween Germ a ny and the A l l i e s , w ritten in
English as well as French. Since then,English has
taken root in diplomacy and gradually in econo-
mic relations and the media. The language now
seems set to have a monopoly as the worldwide
medium of communication.
As the 21st century begins, faster economic
globalization is going hand in hand with the gro-
wing use of English. More and more people are
being encouraged to use or send messages in
English rather than in their own language. Many
do not mind.They see this as part of the unavoi-
dable trend towards worldwide uniformity and a
means whereby a growing number of people can
communicate directly with each other.
From this point of view, the spread of English
m ay be seen as a positive development which save s
resources and makes cultural exchange easier.
After all, it might be said, the advance of English is
not aimed at killing off local languages but is sim-
ply a means of reaching a wider audience.
Perhaps. But accepting that as the last word
ignores the deep-rooted ties between individual
freedom and political power, between the linguis-
tic, social and economic mechanisms which in
every society underpin relations between people
and groups and between culture and communi-
ties. A person makes a mark through his or her
ability to use the most useful language or lan-
guages. And over several generations, the most
useful language eliminates the others.
Cultural imperialism is much more subtle
than economic imperialism, which is itself less
tangible and visible than political and military
imperialism, whose excesses are obvious and easy
to denounce. It would be wrong to say that the
world domination of English is something delibe-
rately organized and supported by the Anglo-
Saxon powers, hand in glove with political initia-
tives or the penetration of the world economy by
their transnational firms.The “language war” has
very seldom been regarded as a war and has
never, anywhere, been declared.
The military, diplomatic, political and econo-
mic strategies of the major powers can be studied
and criticized, but linguistic strategies seem to be
inconspicuous and tacit, even innocent or non-
existent.The history of the past century has obli-
ged many powers to take a more modest attitude
to language, but has it taught them to stand up to
domination by a single language?
M a ny ye a rs after the founding in 1945 of the
Arab League, whose current 22 member states have
250 million people, the countries which share a
French linguistic heritage broke new ground by
c r e ating a joint policy. In order to promote linguis-
t i c, e c o n o mic and political co-operat i o n , they set
up the Intern ational Organization of French-
Speaking Countri e s , which (like the
C o m m o n wealth) embraces more than 50 coun-
t ries with over 500 million inhabitants.
Since 1991, there have been conferences of

The trials of a Gikuyu w r i t e r
◗ M wangi wa Mutahi
Kenyan novelist Mwangi wa Mutahi is now an ardent defender of his native language 
but he was once as hostile to it as some of his own teachers 
Iwas born into a peasant family in 1963, the ye a r
K e nya gained independence. My sole language,a s
a child, was Gikuyu. It was the language in which
we sang songs,n a rr ated stori e s , exchanged riddles or
merely chat t e d , while around us adults conve rsed in
p r overb-loaded exchanges.To the best of my recol-
l e c t i o n , G i k u y u , spoken by about 22 per cent of the
K e nyan populat i o n , was the only language we we r e
taught during the first three ye a rs at school, a l t h o u g h
I had learnt the English alphabet in nurs e ry school. I n
our fourth ye a r , English was reintroduced, and we
had to bid fa r e well to Gikuyu. From there on, s p e a-
king or writing in our mother tongue was forbidden by
school ru l e s. Speaking it exposed us to beating and
p u n i s h m e n t ,and in some cases temporary expulsion.
The resentment with which Gikuyu and other A f ri c a n
languages were treated in my school was almost uni-
ve rsal in Kenyan pri m a ry schools. In the mind of my
e d u c at o rs , A f rican languages were not actually lan-
guages but pri m i t i ve ve rn a c u l a rs.
For a while,before and after my college studies, I
taught in secondary school, an experience which gave
me the opportunity to show my own attitudes towa r d s
A f rican languages.Would I be able to nurture Gikuyu
in my students,or would I wo rship foreign languages

representing some 40 million people, as well as
Ibero-American summits, which every two years
bring together more than 20 countries (350 mil-
lion inhabitants). Turkish-speaking summits have
been held biennially since 1992, with delegates
from six independent countries (120 million
people) of Europe, Central Asia and small ethnic
communities elsewhere. Since 1996, t h e
Association of Portuguese-speaking countries has
brought together people from seven countries
(200 million people).
Pockets
of resistance
Will unco-ordinated resistance by the world’s
most widely-used languages be enough to cope
with the threat of cultural uniformity? Perhaps
not, since each language has its own geographical
sphere in which it is used with varying degrees of
competence. If you add up the number of spea-
kers of the world’s dozen most-used languages,
you come up with a figure of more than three bil-
lion—half of humanity—which easily surpasses
the two billion for whom English is more or less
the official language (the Commonwealth and the
United States). Backed by a concerted strategy,
these major languages would surely make head-
way in international institutions.
It is not just the future of the world’s major
languages that is at stake. Further down the scale
are 100 or so tongues officially recognized by
governments or sub-national regions, such as the
constitutional languages of India and the lan-
guages of the Russian nationalities. These lan-
guages have their place and a right to defend it.At
the bottom of the scale are thousands of some-
times struggling languages variously called native,
minority, communal or ethnic tongues. Most are
in danger of disappearing. They are spoken by
some 300 million people.
Will minor languages die out, as some pre-
dict? Yes, because the best way to kill off a lan-
guage is to teach another one.The monopoly that
about 100 national languages have on education
makes it inevitable that languages not taught in
schools will be confined to the home and to folk-
lore and eventually be pushed out of nurturing
cultural environments.
Language murder or “linguicide”, whether it
is carried out intentionally or not, is one of the
basic tools of ethnocide, of the deculturation of
peoples which has always been perpetrated by
colonization and is still the semi-official aim of
governments which do not recognize the rights of
their native ethnic minorities. As local languages
are increasingly excluded from education sys-
tems, “linguicide” is speeding up.
The language issue in the 21st century 
raises two questions. How can widely-used or
national languages resist the encroachment of
English? And how can minority languages in dan-
ger of extinction be saved and gain access to deve-
lopment? ð■

because the national examinations were in English,
students were easily convinced that they needed to
master this language in order to excel.
Decades after acquiring political independence,
the colonial system of education remains intact. N o
s i g n i ficant policy changes in the teaching of Kenya ’s
languages—the country counts about 40—have been
m a d e .With the exception of Kiswa h i l i , p r o c l a i m e d
by the late leader Jomo Kenyatta as an official lan-
guage along with English, the gove rnment tends to
look upon local languages as a threat to nat i o n a l
u n i t y. Emphasis is still put on excelling in English-
language examinat i o n s , and plenty of A f rican edu-
c at o rs uphold this system. It is the route to prestige,
to potential studies and jobs, locally and abroad.
Writer’s block
For me, the turning point came at the age of 32,
when I sat down to write my first nove l . At the
time I was living in the United Stat e s , working as a
research scientist. In writing Ngoima, I wished to
p o rt r ay the independent Kenyan gove rnment in
its true neo-colonial colours. I wanted to write for
an audience of peasants, wo r k e rs and dispossessed
people.My story exposes issues of corruption and
neglect in the health care system through a wo m a n
who runs into complications during her pregnancy.
I began writing in English, but after the first two
p a r a graphs I realized that the message that I wa n t e d
to delive r , in my mind,was in Gikuyu.This language
t h at I had gr own up speaking at home was more
deeply rooted in my mind than I had thought.As the
s t o ry unfolded and I tried to write dialogue, I stum-
bled again.Was it not false to have my two main cha-
r a c t e rs ,both peasant fa rm e rs , speak in English? Both
were at home in the Gikuyu language and culture.B y
this time, the writing of N go i m a was at a standstill.
S e veral months lat e r , without having picked up
the manuscript again, I had the opportunity to
return home to Kenya, where I spent time among
the kind of people I knew when I was growing up.
In a mysterious manner, this visit home rekindled
my writing of Ngoima. It was as if I had the oppor-
tunity of conve rsing in person with my two fic-
tional characters.At the beginning of 1997, I start e d
Ngoima again, this time in Gikuyu. My thoughts
were so clear that in two months I had completed
the first draft of the novel.
G i k u y u ’s written development has been stunted
because there are not enough people writing in it.
New wo r d s ,t e rms and spellings have lagged behind
other more widely spoken tongues. I ran into these dif-
ficulties throughout the writing of my novel but found
i n s p i r ation in two other wri t e rs (Gakaara and Ngugi )
who had chosen to write in Gikuyu before me. M y
book started selling in Fe b ru a ry 1999. My fat h e r , a
peasant whose reading for most of his life had been
c o n fined to the Bible and hy m n s , told me that reading
the book had been an “ e d u c ational experi e n c e ” f o r
h i m . In following the characters ’l i ve s ,he had also gai-
ned a better understanding of some of the social and
economic issues facing his community.
A way to empowerment
The way N go i m a has been received is a small tes-
t i m o ny that A f rican languages are well and truly alive ,
e ven though publishers rarely accept manuscripts in
them and English continues to be equated with nat i o-
nal and intern ational recognition.Although intellec-
tuals and wri t e rs have taken a firm stand in defence of
all Kenyan languages, their real bedrock of support is
found amongst peasants and wo r k e rs. They are the
ones who have kept the languages alive and evo l v i n g .
They are also the ones who are in dire need of reading
m at e rials in their mother tongue.
Writers and scholars from all regions of Africa
gathered in Eritrea last January for a timely confe-
rence entitled “Against all Odds:A f rican languages
and literatures in the 21st century.” It was the first
conference of its kind on A f rican soil, and was held
in a country that has incorporated nine languages
into its education and development agenda.I rea-
lized that we no longer have to fear that these lan-
guages are going to die, but rather push for ways in
which they can be more widely spoken, read and
t r a n s l at e d .To some, w riting in our own language is
a betrayal of the elite system. I now see it as the way
to break with neocolonial mentalities and empo-
wer the A f rican people. Listening to wri t e rs in A f ri-
can languages from all over the continent was an
i n s p i r ation to continue writing in Gikuyu, and I am
now back home, busy at work on my new novel. ■

26 The UNESCO Courier - April 2000
There is no higher form
of belonging to a
people than to write in
its language.
Heinrich Böll, German writer
( 1 9 1 7 - 1 9 8 5 )
‘Txilek elli yi n taburt a vava invba / ccencen
t i z e b g atin im a yelli ghri b a ” ( “ P l e a s e ,
father Inouba, open the door / Oh Ghriba
girl, jingle your bracelets”).
This refrain from a Kabyle song, “A Vava
Inouva,” rang out around the world in the early
1970s. Only 10 million or so Berbers, scattered
over the Sahara and North Africa, could unders-
tand the words, but the song became an interna-
tional hit.
Its young Algerian author, Hamid Cheriet,
took the stage name of Idir (“he shall live” in
Kabyle). “At a time when many epidemics were
raging, new-born babies were called Idir to ward
off bad luck,” he says. “I chose it as a tribute to
my culture, which I felt was threatened.”
The Berber people, who mostly live in the
mountains of Morocco and A l g e ri a , speak Shaw i ya ,
S h i l h a , K a b y l e , M z a b , R i fa i n , Ta c h e l h i t , Tu a r e g,
Ta r gi and Ta ri fit—all dialects of Ta m a z i g h t , t h e i r
n at i ve tongue, which is only recognized as a nat i o-
nal language in Niger and Mali. In other places,
Berber culture is ignored or even banned.
“They give me an Algerian passport, but I
have to get permission to speak my own langua-
ge,” says Idir who, like the great Martinican poet
Aimé Césaire, speaks up for “those who have no
voice.”
It never occurred to him to write in French,
the language of the colonizer in which he did all
his schooling, right up to a Ph.D in geology. Nor
would he write in Arabic, which was taught as a
second language in Algeria at the time.
“If I hadn’t left my village, I’d never have spo-
ken a word of Arabic,” he says. “French and
Arabic would allow me to get my message over to
a wider audience, but I wouldn’t know how to go
about it or what to say.”
Kabyle is a language of feelings and storytel-
ling that flows naturally in poetry. It is also the
language Idir has chosen to use. “To sing in
Kabyle is a militant act, a way of expressing my
rebellion, to say that I exist,” he says. “If I’d had
another profession, I would have found other
ways to express the same demands.”
Three languages for Algeria
The young Hamid Cheriet stumbled on sin-
ging by accident. He was born in 1955 in Aït
Lahcêne, a remote mountain village in Kabylia.
When he was nine, he went with his parents, sis-
ter and two brothers to Algiers. He attended a
school run by Jesuits,where “being Kabyle meant
you were part of some kind of dirty rebellion.”
His natural sciences teacher taught him to
s t rum a guitar.The future geologist started wri t i n g
songs when he was 16 and wa rmed to the Kabyle
s i n g e rs. In 1973, he was asked to stand in at the last
minute for the famous singer Nouara, who wa s
unable to sing live on the Kabyle radio station in
A l gi e rs the lullaby he had written for her.
Idir was an immediate success. In 1975, he
came to Paris to sign a contract with Pathé-
Marconi and stayed in France. Ever since, this
child of the Aurès mountains has celebrated
Berber culture through music, thus extending a
m ovement launched in the 1940s by major
A l g e rian wri t e rs such as Jean A m r o u c h e ,
Mouloud Mammeri , Mouloud Feraoun and
Kateb Yacine.These pioneers had to use French
to defend the Berber language if they were to get
a hearing.As Amrouche put it:“I think and write
in French, but I weep in Kabyle.”
These day s , Idir can go further than that . H e
a d vo c ates three languages for A l g e ri a — A r a b ,
Berber and French. “I want A l g e ria to take into
account those who live on its land, who love the
c o u n t ry and want to build it what e ver their ori gi n ,
language or religi o n ,” he say s. “Islam shouldn’t be

L a n g u a g e s: c o n flict or coexistence? 
April 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 27
Euskera—the Basque language—is spoken by
some 600,000 people in the Spanish Basque
country and Navarra, and another 80,000 in
the Pyrénées Orientales department of south-
western France. Its origins are unknown, but it
has probably existed for over 4,000 years.
Euskera’s development was severely stunted
during Spain’s 40-year Franco dictatorship. Then
came a major recovery. Euskera became a shared
literary language, won recognition in 1979 as a
joint official language with Spanish, and has been
promoted through teaching.
Basque literature has also been flowering in
the hands of a group of dedicated writers. One of
them,Bernardo Atxaga, 48, who won the Spanish
National Fiction Prize in 1989 for Obabakoak, is
the first writer in the Basque language to achieve
an international reputation.
Did the crackdown on Euskera during the Franco
era really happen, or is it a myth?
It definitely happened, but it’s also true that
Euskera wasn’t doing so well before the Civil War.
Only a society that can afford to have doctors on
A B a s q u e writer

couldn’t agree more with these words from a 16th-century Basque song.

works published in English are
Lone Man (Harvill,1996) and
Obabakoak (Vintage, 1993)
call on Sundays, as it were, can afford to be
concerned about saving its language. Before the
war, the Basque country was confronted with ter-
rible economic problems. Saving the language
was a miracle only intellectuals and priests could
have performed. My own case is typical, in a way.
My grandfather and great-grandfather were car-
penters. They had plenty of other things to worry
about than preserving the language. I had a diffe-
rent kind of education from theirs, and it led me
to ask why I was losing the use of a language that
I had inherited. Political repression was fierce
when I was a child. My brothers and I were bea-
ten at school if we were caught speaking Euskera,
the language we spoke at home. We knew we ris-
ked punishment if we spoke Basque in public.
With the coming of democracy, Basque autonomy
and laws covering language, the situation changed
totally within a few years. Today Basque is a
compulsory school subject. What do you think about
this?
English is compulsory too.This is a very com-
plex issue. How far does a state have the right to
an official religi o n . R e l i gion is for believe rs , n o t
g ove rn m e n t s. Arabic shouldn’t have a special sta-
tus just because it’s the holy language of the
Koran—especially classical A r a b i c, a sanitized
tongue ordinary people can’t unders t a n d . No lan-
guage is more wo rt hy than another, e ven if Berber
is the oldest in terms of ye a rs. Fate has put these
languages on this land and they must remain
t h e r e .”
Straddling two cultures
But for the time being, the Kabyle radio stat i o n
t h at opened in 1948 is still the only media outlet in
Algeria that uses Berber. It is also “the only one
monitored by a censorship board,” says Idir. Ano-
ther French colonial legacy enables “ you to get
credits in Berber towards your baccalaureate gra-
d u ation exam if you wa n t .” But the language is not
part of the national curriculum. Since his election
in April 1999, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has
ruled out officially recognizing Berber, except after
a referendum that Kabyles fear might backfire.
“It’s a very dangerous idea. If such a vote took
place, the result might well be ‘no’,” says Idir.
“And if people say ‘no’ and reject a part of them-
selves, it would mean there’s nothing we can do
together. Except for a few fanatics, Berbers have
n e ver wanted independence.” Their main
demand is to be recognized as Berbers in their
own country. “As a Kabyle, I want to be an
Algerian through and through, not just partially,
as I am today,” he says.
A member of a minority group both in Algeria
and in France, Idir has chosen to straddle cultures.
“ I d e n t i t i e s ” , the title of his latest albu m , released by
Sony at the end of last year,is far from bland.Sin-
ging with him are Ireland’s Karen Mat h e s o n ,G e o f-
frey Oryema from Uganda, Bretons Gilles Servat
and Dan Ar Braz, the French-Galician Manu Chao,
the French groups Gnawa Diffusion and Zebda
(of Arab and Berber ori gi n s ) , all of them represen-
t at i ves of small cultures. He says they have allowe d
him to show that his own minority culture can be
part of the wider world. ■

lay down the law in education? At present, all
states do so. The education ministry plays a very
important role in all countries, and the area of
freedom in this sphere is very small. That being
said, people who live in the Basque country and
don’t want to know anything about our language
and culture aren’t worthy of respect.
Do you think Euskera is used too much as a political
pawn?
I really don’t think so. I don’t see how half a
million people can cause much mischief for 35
million Spanish-speakers. On the contrary, I
think there’s been a lot of unfairness on the part
of the majority group. National newspapers never
print anything positive about our language. I
think that’s unjust.
The unification of Euskera around an agreed version
of the language continues to provoke controversy.
Do you think standardization was necessary to
enable Euskera to survive?
No language in the world can develop if it is
fundamentally divided. All languages spin off
variants, but at the same time they seek the com-
mon basis without which no language can per-
form its higher functions. You can’t write books
about architecture in pidgin,you have to use stan-
dard English, which is better qualified to express
what you want to say. Among English-speakers,
each community develops its own accent, its own
way of using the language. You can be for or
against this but, as a language teacher I know
used to tell his Chicano students: “You can speak
Spanglish if you like, but if you want to study law,
you’ll have to write in English.” All languages that
develop tend towards simplification. The same
friend told me that language is nowhere more
complex than in a village. In Chicago or New
York, English is a lot simpler than it is in a remo-
te village in Ireland.
You’re completely bilingual. Why do you always
write first in Euskera?
In literary terms, I’m used to thinking in
Euskera. My stories or poems come to me in
Euskera. It’s my personal language, the one I use
to jot down ideas in my notebooks, whether I’m
in Stockholm or Madrid. I’ve become used to
doing that. It’s not much to do with ideology, it’s
just the way I work. Some writers need to go into
a monastery and stay there for a few months
without setting foot outside. My writing ritual
involves writing first in Basque. I’ve come to the
conclusion that it isn’t very important. I might
just as well write in some other language.
But you insist on translating your own work.
Some languages are quite close to each other,
they’re like tracings that match when you put one
on top of another. This is the case with Catalan
and Spanish. I see translation as a physical leap,
and the jump from Catalan to Spanish is like
stepping off the pavement onto the road. With
Basque, the leap is enormous. And leaving it to a
translator is a risky business. My translations are
usually the work of several hands. Close friends of
mine produce a rough draft and I extract a final
version from it. It’s very hard to explain what it’s
like being a bilingual writer. Sitting down to
translate one’s own work is a mind-bending expe-
rience. Every time I do it, the gap between the
two texts seems to widen.
Yet your books are translated into other languages
from Spanish. Isn’t that a bit of a cop-out?
Not at all, because I believe that language is
always part of a person’s way of life, and for me
Spanish is also a first language.There are two first
languages in my life and luckily I can express
myself just as well in both.
Do you consider yourself a nationalist?
I rather like Spain. I’m not in favour of politi-
cal independence. I don’t think Spain’s a bad
society or a bad country.You can be part of it and
have a critical eye. ■

L a n g u a g e s: c o n flict or coexistence? 
April 2000 -The UNESCO Courier 29
◗ Head of UN E S C O’s Languages
D i v i s i o n
What’s the chief aim of international language
policy?
To promote trilingualism in every society.This is a
goal some countries achieved a long time ago.
L u xe m bu r g, for example. If you tell Luxe m bu r-
g e rs they can “afford the luxury ” of having three lan-
guages because they’re rich,they’ll tell you they’re
rich precisely because they’re rooted in tri l i n g u a l i s m .
What are these three languages we have to learn?
Our mother tongue,obviously, a “neighbour”lan-
guage and an intern ational language. UN E S C O’s
language policy replaces the standard idea of a
“foreign”language with the notion of a neighbour
l a n g u a g e , a language spoken just over the border.We
most often go to war against our neighbours , so we
h ave to learn their language, d i s c over their needs and
ambitions and know their culture and values.
Minority languages are meanwhile steadily
disappearing. How can they be saved?
A language is always in danger when it isn’t part
of the school curri c u l u m . Once it’s gi ven the stat u s
of a teaching language, e ven for just part of the cur-
ri c u l u m , a whole “rescue apparat u s ” is created and
the language becomes alive again and is save d .
Is monolingualism a handicap?
I t ’s always a gr e at disadva n t a g e . It means you only
see the world through the inevitably limited dimen-
sion of a single language, e ven if it’s a world language.
I t ’s also a factor of domination because people who
can afford to stay monolingual live in countries that
h ave overwhelming political, economic and military
p owe r. And it adds to “linguistic insecuri t y ” , a new
concept which reflects a ve ry old tru t h . E ven at
UN E S C O, we see it regularly at intern ational gat h e-
ri n g s. D e l e g ates who speak minority languages often
d o n ’t speak up.They have ve ry good ideas but don’t
dare to express them because they feel uncomfort a b l e
using UN E S C O’s official languages. People whose
mother tongue is an intern ational one are ve ry pri-
v i l e g e d .I t ’s quite unfa i r. ■
Interview by Araceli Ortiz de Urbina,
UNESCO Courier journalist
Is there a link between language policy and the
culture of peace?
Ye s ,t h e y ’re directly connected.When a minori t y
mother tongue comes under attack, its users feel
u n c o m f o rtable and experience an inner confli c t .A n d
when people aren’t at peace with themselves, they
c a n ’t be at peace with others. Languages are still the
only tools which allow us to communicat e — t o
relate to and understand each other—whether by
w ri t i n g, speaking or through the Intern e t .This idea
of focusing on languages as instruments of dia-
logue to tackle intolerance and violence has been the
d riving force behind UN E S C O’s Linguapax pro-
gramme (see box page 30) for more than 15 years.
Isn’t the international community very slow in
getting to grips with the language question?
I t ’s coming round to it. Sixty-nine countri e s
presented a draft resolution to the United Nations
General Assembly in December 1999 to promote
respect for multilingualism. UN E S C O’s General
Conference has just passed four resolutions backing
language dive rsity and multilingual educat i o n .T h e
European Union and the Council of Europe are
planning a European Year of Languages in 2001 with
UNESCO backing.This is a good example of inter-
national co-operation because it involves all lan-
g u a g e s , not just European ones. It will also mark the
start of many other projects around the world.
How do you explain this about-turn?
For several ye a rs now, the language question has
been high on the world education agenda. UN E S C O
member states are increasingly asking us to help
s o l ve ve ry complicated language problems and
i s s u e s. E u r o p e , along with Asia and Latin A m e-
rica, has realized that the third millennium will be
an era of co-operation and and confederation and
that the need to preserve identities will have to be
balanced with the demands of communication.

UN E S C O’s work in the field of languages began to take off in
the mid-1980s. A key step was the launch of the Linguapax pro-
ject in 1986.This was designed “to associate the teaching of lan-
guages with the promotion of intern ational understanding and
p e a c e ,” s ays Félix Mart i , head of UN E S C O’s A d v i s o ry Committee
for Linguistic Pluralism and Multilingual Educat i o n , which wa s
set up in 1998.
In the last 15 years, Linguapax has provided technical
back-up for a number of national and regional projects, inclu-
ding the rebuilding of Cambodia’s educational system around
the Khmer language. This involved producing two million
school textbooks in Khmer and training a team of Cambodian
teachers and editors. Linguapax has also set up an inter-uni-
ve rsity network co-ordinated by the Unive rsity of Mons
(Belgium) to promote the project and its methods, and is wor-
king on a report on the world’s languages (see below).
Protecting linguistic diversity and encouraging multilingual
education are two closely-related goals. To promote the for-
mer, Linguapax has put together guides and manuals for tea-
chers and policy-makers in countries, especially in Africa, that
want to incorporate local languages into their education sys-
tem. A new project, called Pericles, will promote the learning
of neighbouring languages by encouraging young people from
adjacent countries to work together to preserve shared natural
and cultural heritage sites. A project currently at an experi-
mental stage in the border region where Luxemburg, France
and Germany meet is designed to be applied internationally
wherever there is a desire to boost regional co-operation or in
areas recovering from wars.
There is international awareness about the need to protect
the non-tangible heritage of humanity such as languages but
there is no legal instrument to back it up. “Unfortunately the-
re’s no international agreement referring specifically to linguis-
tic rights,” says Marti.“It’s a very sensitive subject, but it is up
to UNESCO to draft an international instrument to protect
them which could be adopted by most countries.”
Report on 
the Wo r l d ’s Languages
“ W h at is the name of your language? Is it used in written form ?
Where is it spoken? What are its geographical frontiers?”These
and many other questions feature in a UNESCO world language
s u rvey begun in 1997.The answe rs to them, along with input from
research institutes, specialists and bibliographical sources, will go
into the first edition of a UN E S C O R e p o rt on the Wo rl d ’s Language s,
to be published in 2001.

A mass of information about languages can be

a working tool by students, t r a n s l at o rs and tea-
c h e rs. They can find sites from which they can
download for free the characters of currently used
alphabets, such as Cyrillic, Mandarin or Hebrew,
alphabets that have died out, such as Egyptian hie-
r o g l y p h i c s , and even invented languages such as
t h at created by J. R . R .To l k i e n , author of the epic tri-
logy The Lord of the Rings, not to mention sites offe-

Eurodicautom, it is a kind of super-dictionary with
more than 5.5 million entries in 12 European lan-

But in the battle for multilingualism, the Intern e t
is a double-edged swo r d , since most of its contents
are only in English. The 1999-2000 edition of

French (3.7%).
In terms of the number of web pages, the domi-

32 The UNESCO Courier - April 2000
The Shuar are an indigenous people of the Ecua-
d o rian A m a z o n .Long known to the outside wo r l d
as the Jiva r o, their tough, independent character
and their legendary technique of shrinking human
heads have been described by many trave l l e rs and mis-
s i o n a ri e s.They proudly claim that they have never been
c o n q u e r e d .N ow these one-time hunters and gat h e-
r e rs ,who turned to rearing cat t l e , gr owing citrus fru i t
or practicing traditional horticulture deep in the A m a-
zonian forest,h ave taken a route into the modern wo r l d
t h at enables them to keep their language and culture.
Salesian Catholic priests who came to the
region to convert the indigenous people to Chris-
tianity witnessed the land seizures, settler bru t a l i t y
and other injustices of which the Shuar were vic-
t i m s.They answered their appeal for help by streng-
thening the cohesion of Shuar society and culture
so that they could meet the challenges of rampant
greed and modernization.
In 1964, the priests helped the Shuar to shape
their destiny by setting up the Federation of Shuar
C e n t r e s , the first autonomous organization of its
kind in Latin America.A precursor of the indige-
nous Indian movement which became an impor-
tant political force in Ecuador in the 1990s, t h e
f e d e r ation became to all intents and purposes a
Shuar state within the Ecuadorian state. Its man-
date covered everything from land distribution to
the administration of health and education serv i c e s.
Bilingual schooling by radio
The main agent of this limited autonomous inte-
gr ation was the Bi-cultural Shuar Radio Educat i o n
System (SERBISH). Radio proved to be the most
suitable means of communication in the inaccessible
r e gion of dense forests and impenetrable mountains
where the Shuar live .A radio education scheme using
Shuara and Spanish began in 1968 and four ye a rs
l ater officially became the backbone of the bilingual
schools which had recently been set up.
The chief purpose of bilingual and bicultural
e d u c ation was to teach people Spanish so they
could demand equal treatment as Ecuadorian citi-
zens and to enable Shuara to become a vibrant
m o d e rn language. Shuar families were enthusiastic
from the start about a system which did not require
them to send their children away to austere Salesian
boarding schools where they would be cut off from
their environment and culture. Making bilingua-
lism acceptable meant Shuar children no longer
needed to be ashamed of speaking their own lan-
guage.
SERBISH started out with 33 schools.Within
two years it was broadcasting to 120 and numbers
have been rising ever since. Today, it reaches four
p r ovinces of eastern Ecuador, and provides educa-
tion for about 7,500 children—out of a Shuar
p o p u l ation of 70,000—in 297 schools teaching
from primary to the end of the secondary level.
Linguistic pioneers
The ministry of education has authorized the
work of “tele-auxiliaries”, Shuar teachers paid by
the government or local volunteers who receive a
wage for helping children to listen and learn from
the radio programmes while the teacher attends to
pupils at another grade.
The school system comprises a national curri c u-
lum which prepares children for official exams in Spa-
nish and another which teaches a course in Shuar lan-
guage and culture. At firs t , the courses kept close to
the national curri c u l u m , including its religious bias
due to the Salesians’ i n flu e n c e .To d ay cours e wo r k
focuses more on the traditional Shuar wo r l d - v i e w,
and includes components on folklore,craft techniques
and local plant and animal life as well as lessons to
prepare children for modern life. In addition to a
s e c o n d a ry school diploma in Intercultural Bilingual
E d u c ation (EIB) and in chemistry and biology, S E R-
BISH has for the past year offered one in fa rming tech-
n o l o g y, including sustainable use of resources.
The Shuar are rightly proud of being pioneers,
not just in Ecuador but wo r l d w i d e , and are not
deterred by the current serious problems of their
c o u n t ry, c rushed by heavy foreign debt, m a s s i ve
financial crisis and a plan to make the U.S. dollar
the national curr e n cy which may have gr ave conse-
quences for the poorest Ecuadorians.
The Shuar Fe d e r at i o n ’s radio equipment has not
been updated since the 1960s, which means recep-
tion is poor in some remote communities. A gr e e-
ments were signed last year with foreign aid institu-
tions including Germ a ny ’s GTZ, which topped up
the meagre funding from the Ecuadorian ministry of
e d u c at i o n .M a ny teachers , who earn just over $40 a
m o n t h , cannot travel to the remotest communities,
which can only be reached by small plane.
But it will take more than that to discourage the

determined Shuar. Relying on their organizational
strength,they now have some very ambitious pro-
jects, incljuding one for an educational television

assistance and funding.
In the search for an altern at i ve to modern i z at i o n
imposed from above, the Shuar have managed to
reduce semi-illiteracy to seven per cent and total
illiteracy to two per cent.With the self-confidence

speaks one or more indigenous languages, people
had to wait until the new 1998 Constitution for
f o rmal recognition that “ For the indigenous
peoples, Quechua, Shuara and other ancient lan-
guages are officially used.”
French linguist Louis-Jean Calvet notes that
Shuar linguistic policy is atypical because it is com-
pletely independent of the state.“As a policy for a
minority, decided by them and applied by them,it
shows how the expansion of the world’s steadily-

consists of 26 states and six Union terri t o ri e s , a
number of which were formed in 1956 on a unilin-
gual basis to reduce the number of linguistic mino-
rities by bri n ging together people who speak a com-
mon language. But the official languages adopted
by the states and terri t o ries are not necessarily spo-
ken by all their respective populations; not one of
them is completely monolingual.
English, a social
status symbol
This structure has encouraged the develop-
ment of some languages at the expense of others.
There are, for instance, over 1,600 languages
known as mother tongues, the great majority of
which have no official status and therefore lack
protection. Further complexity is added by the
fact that every language community consists of at
least three interlanguages. Hindi alone has 48
variants. In this country where nationhood is a
recent phenomenon, language has become a focal
point of socio-political action. Unsurprisingly,
language policy has always been a subject of
debate and controversy between politicians, edu-
cators and planners.
To d ay in the official domain there is a strict hie-
r a r c hy of Indian languages. At the top are Hindi
and English. Next come the official languages of
the states and terri t o ri e s , f o l l owed by languages
w h i c h , although not used for administrat i ve pur-
poses, are spoken by more than a million people.
Hundreds of others at the foot of the ladder are
monitored by a Commissioner for Linguistic Mino-
rities who only has advisory powe rs and cannot
force state governments to follow his recommen-
d at i o n s. Some state gove rnments are optimistically
hoping that minority languages within their juris-
diction will die out before they get a chance to be
used in education.
M e a n w h i l e , English is gaining gr o u n d . In 1949
constitutional provision was made for parliamen-
t a ry business to be transacted in Hindi or in English
but that after 15 years only Hindi should be used.
H owe ve r , after this time had elapsed, Hindi wa s
just as much a foreign language as English for two -
thirds of the population. Regarded as a “neutral”
language for wider communicat i o n , and the lan-
guage of technology, modernity and development,
English is also a social status symbol.The resultant
Anglomania is detrimental not only to the gr owth of
Indian languages but also to the “ n o rm a l ” d e ve-
lopment of Indian society. It sometimes reaches
grotesque proport i o n s. Politicians who decry the
use of English sometimes send their children to the
best schools in which English is the medium of ins-
truction.
It is up to the intellectual elites of minority com-
munities to promote their mother tongues. Often
bi- or trilingual,they must initiate projects to keep
out the neo-colonial intru d e r , gi ve a new impetus to
dying languages and adapt them to the modern
world. ■

L a n g u a g e s: c o n flict or coexistence? 
April 2000 - The UNESCO Courier 35
Just as ecology depicts the world as a series of
interlocking parts ranging from the single cell
to the ecosphere, the planet’s languages can be
presented as a system based on gravity. Today the
keystone of that system is English, a “hypercen-
tral” language around which a dozen “supercen-
tral” languages gravitate. Between 100 and 200
“central” languages, linked to the supercentral
ones through bilingual speakers, are in their turn
s u rrounded by 4,000-5,000 “ p e ri p h e r a l ” l a n-
guages.
These languages do not all have the same
we i g h t , the same vigour or the same prospects.T h e
future of the vast majority is in doubt, and more
and more efforts are being made to preserve them.
L a n g u a g e s , like baby seals or whales, are regarded
as endangered species (see pages 18 and 19).
But anxiety is not only focusing on the “ p e r-
i p h e r a l ” l a n g u a g e s. C o n c e rn is also being expres-
sed about the widely-spoken hyper or super-central
l a n g u a g e s , including English and French. In the
United Stat e s , o r g a n i z ations such as US English,
US First and Save Our Schools are campaigning
for English to be recognized as the country ’s sole
o f ficial language in face of gr owing bilingualism
due to substantial Hispanic immigr at i o n . I n
F r a n c e , the 1994 “ Toubon Law ” was an attempt to
r e g u l ate the use of French by resisting the use of
words borr owed from other languages.
The myth
of language purity
Language purity is a myth which leads only to
stagnation. The Latin that Cicero spoke is per-
haps a pure language, but nobody speaks it any
more. Today different versions of Latin that have
developed over the centuries are used. They
include Italian, Spanish, Romanian, French and
Catalan.
This my t h , this desire to protect, i l l u s t r ates a
thoughtless fear of change, of borr owing words and
expressions from other languages. It is as if only
stability could somehow guarantee identity. H ow
far can or should policies to protect languages go?
Is it possible to keep alive language forms abando-
ned by their users , sustaining them by a kind of
d rip-feed or other forms of intensive medicat i o n ?
Some language policies have been successful.
In Turkey in the early part of the 20th century,
Kemal Atatürk used authoritarian methods to
reform the spelling of Turkish, and struck out of
the Turkish dictionary words borr owed from
Arabic and Farsi. Indonesia has adopted a uni-
fying language, Bahasa. In other countries, things
have been less straightforward. Arabization in
Algeria is still confronted by major obstacles, and
the attempt by the late Guinean president Sekou
Touré to make his country officially multilingual
was a total failure.
“Language war”:
a convenient metaphor
A language policy can only work if it is attu-
ned to the way in which a society is evolving.Only
rarely can a language or reform be imposed on
people against their will. Is it possible to defend
(or save) a language whose speakers don’t want it
any more? The issue is not the language itself but
the importance attached to it by its speakers. A
language policy cannot ignore them.
A language disappears not only because it is
dominated by another, but also—and perhaps
above all—because people decide to abandon it
and do not pass it on to their children.The term
“language war” is a convenient metaphor, but
languages themselves cannot wage war on each
other. It is people who struggle, fight or agree
with each other. We can follow their conflictual
relationships by looking at the relationship bet-
ween their languages.
Linguists are always sorry when a language dies
o u t , but languages are not museum pieces. T h e y
belong to the people who speak them and constantly
change and adapt to their needs. They are there to
s e rve people and not vice-ve rs a . The evolution of
language forms and the relationships between them
is an ongoing process, and while some die, o t h e rs
are born , sometimes before our eye s.
Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the
break-up of Yu g o s l av i a , new countries have
appeared and new languages are making them-
selves heard—Bosnian,Serbian, and Croatian,for
example, which until recently were considered to
be a single language, Serbo-Croat. The speakers
of these languages are affirming their identity by
stressing and increasing the difference between
them, though this only amounts to a few dozen
words. Likewise, the division of Czechoslovakia

into the Czech Republic and Slovakia has pushed
the Czech and Slovak languages further apart.
In francophone Africa, local forms of the offi-
cial language, French, are emerging. Slightly dif-
ferent variants of French are spoken in Senegal,
Gabon, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire.
These differences, slight though they are so fa r ,
perhaps herald a break-up of French, which may
become a kind of mother tongue for a new genera-
tion of speakers , just as Latin is the mother of the
Romance languages.The same goes for English,A r a-
bic and Spanish.The Spanish spoken in Madrid is
not quite the same as that spoken in Buenos A i r e s ,
and there are differences between London English
and Bombay English.The Arabic of Rabat is not at all
the same as that spoken in Riya d h .
The function of languages influences their
f o rm . The languages used for trade in the markets
of A f rican capitals are gradually becoming different
from their ve rnacular form s. The Wolof spoken in
Dakar is no longer the Wolof that rural people
s p e a k , and the Bambara heard in Bamako is not
the same as that spoken in Ségou, 230 kilometres
away.
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
in various situations, Creole languages developed
as a linguistic solution to the communication pro-
blem faced by slaves speaking different languages
when they were taken to the
Indian Ocean islands or to the
C a ri b b e a n . Using European
tongues such as English,
French or Po rtuguese as a
basis, they created languages
which today are different. A Mauritian, a Haitian
and a Guyanese cannot understand each other,
even though their languages have a common
ancestor—French. Perhaps the children of immi-
grants will one day speak, along with the langua-
ge of their host country, a Germanicized version
of Turkish, say, or a Frenchified Arabic.
An ever-changing
language map
English may not escape this process. Its world
domination today is indisputable and will proba-
bly last for a while. But history shows that the
more a language spreads geographically, the more
variations it generates,so what happened to Latin
may happen to English.
This being the case, the world language map is
clearly going to change over the next few centuri e s.
M a ny languages currently spoken by only a few
people are dying out and new ones are appeari n g
or will appear.This means that in the gr av i t at i o n a l
model described above , languages and their func-
tions will evo l ve . The hypercentral and supercen-
tral languages may change, and some peri p h e r a l
languages may become central (and vice-ve rs a ) .
Like history itself, the history of languages does
not stand still. It moves on, constantly changi n g
and being shaped by the practices of users. ■
Time changes everything.
There is no reason why
language 
should escape that
universal law.

In a Strasbourg (France) laboratory, a speck of blood for genetic analysis 
is taken from a boot.
DNA 
IN THE DOCK 
◗ Martine Jacot
Genetic fingerprinting provides virtually flawless proof and is helping to identify criminals and
free people jailed for crimes they did not commit. But does it violate basic human rights?
■
Police and judges in We s t e rn countri e s
all agree that the arri val of genetic tes-
ting in their daily lives is a far more
r e vo l u t i o n a ry development than the intro-
duction of fin g e rp rinting at the end of the
19th century. It is now just about impossible
to say a criminal has “disappeared without
l e aving any trace,” e ven if he or she wo r e
g l ove s.
Forensic science has made a great leap
forward since 1985,when British scientist
Alex Jeffreys discovered a new way of
identifying people genetically through
their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the
molecule at the core of each living cell. It
is now possible to draw up a person’s
genetic identity card within five or six
hours at minimal cost1 working from infi-
nitesimal pieces of evidence,2 such as a
minute speck of blood, a single hair, a
trace of saliva left on a cigarette butt, a
stamp, a glass or a toothbrush,from sweat
on clothing or, more important, a tiny
drop of a rapist’s sperm. However despite
this “proof”, we should remember that
just because a person’s “traces”have been
found at the scene of a crime, it does not
necessarily mean they are guilty.
Death row prisoners cleared
Except in the case of identical twins,
the structure of a pers o n ’s DNA is

lities, at least not yet, and is partly made
up of identical sequences. It is these
“repeat units”that are analysed to compi-
le a person’s genetic profile, which takes
the form of a series of figures. These data
are like bar codes which can be easily sto-
red as a computer file. This is a positive
development, say many Western crimino-
logists and the families of crime victims.
Defenders of civil liberties who predict
new Orwellian nightmares, beg to differ.
An Afro-American called A.B. Butler
is one of those whose life was saved by
DNA testing. He was freed in January
1999 after 16 years in prison in Tyler,
Texas, and his 99-year jail sentence for
kidnapping and raping a young white
woman in 1983 was quashed. As soon as
he heard about DNA tests, he asked to be
given one, knowing that the police had
kept a sample of the rapist’s sperm.Three
laboratories confirmed that his genetic
fingerprint was not that of the rapist.
Since the FBI began testing people’s
DNA in 1989, at least 54 pri s o n e rs serv i n g
long sentences, mostly for rape, h ave been
declared innocent in the United Stat e s.T h e
defence of 35 of them was handled by the
l aw school at New Yo r k ’s Ye s h i va Unive rs i t y
as part of the Innocence Project (IP) laun-
ched in 1992 by Prof. B a rry Scheck. T h e
p r o j e c t ’s goal is to make DNA tests routine
when evidence has been kept in the case of
p ri s o n e rs who claim to be innocent bu t
cannot afford a good law ye r.The stakes are
h i g h . Six of the pri s o n e rs freed by the
e f f o rts of the students and teachers invo l ve d
in the project were on death row.
Building databases
“Genetic testing can also help find the
real criminal more quickly,” s ays Scheck.“ I t

time and money in an inve s t i g at i o n . It can

h ave already helped pinpoint the authors
of more than 200 cri m e s , though so fa r
only sex offences and violent cri m e s.
Resistance to the compilation of such
databases has focused on one key ques-
tion. Should a sample for a DNA test be
taken from someone without their per-
mission? The law in Western countries is
not always clear on this but the principle
has been accepted—in Germ a ny, t h e
N e t h e r l a n d s , N o r way, S we d e n , F r a n c e
and the U.S.—that a sample of blood or
saliva can be taken on the orders of a
judge or a police officer in the course of
an investigation.
But the line between police require-
ments and individual liberties is still a ve ry
hazy one. “When there’s an inve s t i g at i o n
among the inhabitants of a village after a
c ri m e , sample-taking should be vo l u n t a ry,”
s ays Jean Michaud, a member of the
French National Ethics Committee, “ yet a
refusal (to allow a DNA test) can be inter-
preted as grounds for suspicion.”
M a ny police admit howe ver that a per-
s o n ’s DNA can always be analysed from
their confis c ated toothbrush or their coffee
cup without them know i n g, which does
not directly violate their “ p hysical pers o n ”
or their “human dignity”, concepts reco-
gnized in laws on bioethics that have been
passed in many We s t e rn countri e s. S u c h
“ u n fair methods” are clearly condemned
in theory but not explicitly by law.
Constitutional protection
In the United Stat e s , the Massachusetts
state legislature passed a law in 1997 allo-
wing the archiving of data on convicted cri-
minals with retroactive effect. All pri s o n
i n m ates in the state were therefore “ a s k e d ”
to give a blood sample, ostensibly for the
“ s t at i s t i c a l ” reason that many pri s o n e rs
commit new crimes after their release.But
some refused, citing—on the advice of their
l aw ye rs—the fourth amendment to the
U. S . constitution which protects citizens
against “unreasonable searches and sei-
suppose the existence of ways to compare
the genetic profile of someone being sought
and the profile of a suspect. This means
building a database of genetic fin g e rp ri n t s.
In the absence of such dat a b a s e s , police in
the We s t e rn world inve s t i g ating seri o u s
c rimes proceed by trial and err o r ,a n a l y s i n g
DNA from entire villages and neighbou-
r h o o d s.
Police in Britain,who were pioneers in
the field, created such a database in 1995
“backed by women’s groups who suppor-
ted technology that could identify rapists
quickly,” says Peter Martin,a former chief
of Scotland Yard’s laboratories. “When it
was then found that rapists often already
had a record of petty crime,” the databa-
se was expanded.
An identikit picture
from a piece of chewing gum
In Bri t a i n , a nyone arrested or suspec-
ted of a crime can be asked to provide a
s a l i va sample to compile their DNA iden-
tity card. The database currently has the
“bar codes” of about 700,000 people, a n d
in 10 ye a rs time five million of the coun-
t ry ’s 58.6 million people are expected to be
in it. In five ye a rs , the database has enabled
thousands of matches or “cold hits” to be
made that Martin says have led to the
i d e n t i fic ation of more than 260 murderers ,
400 rapists and 2,500 bu r g l a rs.
Police everywhere are naturally keen
to gather all the information they can.
Some are now dreaming of being able to
make an identikit picture of a criminal
just from a piece of chewing gum found
near the scene of the crime. Current ana-
lysis done on non-coding DNA by the
PCR3 method enables the sex of a person
to be determined but not the age or
colour of hair or eyes. But it will be pos-
sible in the future, scientists say. Some
human rights defence organizations say
such cataloguing must stop immediately
and deplore the inadequacy of safeguards
to protect individual liberties.
The fiercest debate about this issue is
r a ging in the United States around the
F B I ’s launch in October 1998 of a nat i o n a l
d at a b a s e , C o d i s , which combines biologi-
cal and computer processes to link up
d atabases in each of the 50 U. S .s t at e s.T h e
FBI says it has 260,000 files on people that
zures”.A Boston court set a precedent in
August 1998 by ruling in their favour and
giving the opinion that taking DNA
samples without permission was a clear vio-
lation of human rights.
“Why don’t we make a database of all
poor people?” asked one of the prisoners’
lawyers, Benjamin Keehn. “Are they also
more likely to commit crimes? Where do
you stop?” The protest against such
moves, which has spread to other states,is
organized by the American Civil Liberties
Union ( ACLU) Freedom Netwo r k , w h i c h
has 250,000 members.The ACLU appea-
led before the National Commission on
the Future of DNA Evidence, a 19-mem-
ber body of distinguished experts set up
at the request of President Bill Clinton,
against the extension of the federal Codis
system to any person who was arrested.
AC L U ’s associate director, B a rry
Steinhardt, said it would mean “equating
arrest with guilt” and would give “police
officers, rather than judges and juries, the
power to force persons to provide the
state with evidence that harbours many of
their most intimate secrets and those of
A GENET IC 
DATA BASE 
F OR EUROPE ’ S
P OL ICE
In 1997, the European Union Council of Minis-
ters* “invited member states to consider esta-
blishing national DNA databases” and “e x c h a n g e
DNA analysis results” as a way of making “a
s i g n i ficant contribution” to criminal investiga-
tions, provided it was “limited to exchanging
data from the non-coding part of the DNA mole-
cule, which can be assumed not to contain infor-
mation about specific hereditary qualities.
“It is up to each member state,” the Council
said, “to decide on the conditions under which,
and the offences regarding which, the DNA ana-
lysis results may be stored in a national database.
The taking of DNA material for the purpose of sto-
ring DNA analysis results should be subject to
safeguards designed to protect the physical inte-
grity of the person concerned.”
It added that “creation of a European DNA
database should be considered as a second step
once the conditions for the exchange of the DNA
analysis results are realized.” ■

3. Polymerase Chain Reaction, or genetic
amplification, which became routine in the late
1980s,is the fastest, cheapest and most accurate
method. It requires less DNA than the earlier
RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism) method, which is no longer used
in Western countries. It is now possible,by
looking at a specific marker on sex chromosomes,
to identify a person’s sex by PCR.
‘When there’s an investigation
among the inhabitants 
of a village after a crime,
s a m p l e - taking should be

(to allow a DNA test) 
can be interpreted as grounds
for suspicion.’

their blood relatives.”
Another set of vital questions arises
from this debate. Who owns the DNA
used to establish a person’s genetic ID—
the person concern e d , the laborat o ry
which did the test, or the police? Should
the sample be destroyed or kept, and if
kept, for how long? The “bar codes” in the
files may for the moment be of little use to
s n o o p e rs , but the “ o ri gi n a l ” D N A
samples contain chromosomes and there-
fore a mass of genetic information about
the person and their relatives,since the 23
pairs of chromosomes we all have are pas-
sed down half and half from each of our
parents.
Who can guarantee that the DNA
samples held in the police databases and
laboratories will not one day be analysed
by nosy people working for, s ay, l i f e
insurance companies to find out if someo-
ne is likely to develop this or that disease?
G e rm a ny, A u s t ri a , F i n l a n d , S we d e n ,
Denmark and the Netherlands have all
removed this risk by ordering the destruc-
tion of the samples once the ID has been
established. Other countries allow police
and labs to keep them—forever in Britain,
for 40 years in France’s planned database
and for various periods in different U.S.
states. The excuse is usually that the
sample might need to be examined again
in the future.
A Pandora’s box
Especially in the last group of coun-
t ri e s , n o n - g ove rnmental organizat i o n s
and ethics committees have criticized 
the growth of “small genetic databases”
collected by laboratories with government
authorization and by private firms acting
in accordance with the law.
Steinhardt points to a survey carri e d
out by the A m e rican Management
A s s o c i ation which found that six per cent
of employe rs were already using genetic
tests as part of job-hiring procedures
without the knowledge of the candidat e s.
The Pe n t a g o n , he told the U. S . c o m m i s-
s i o n ,c u rrently has samples from three mil-
lion of its present and former employees in
a database ori ginally set up to help identi-
fy soldiers killed in the Viet Nam Wa r.
“Once the genetic information is col-
lected and banked, pressures will mount
to use it for other purposes than those for
which it was gathered,” he said. “In fact,
on several occasions, the FBI has already
requested access to this data for purposes
of criminal investigations.”
P r o f. Philip Reilly, a member of the
c o m m i s s i o n , a gr e e s. “There is a prolifera-
tion of databases with DNA in all sorts of
areas in our society which theoretically
could be linked one way or another.” H e
also notes that “ we already collected in
1999 blood from 99.8 per cent of the
babies born in the United States and we
are storing it without their consent.We also
subject it to DNA analysis in some cases.”
The U.S. commission finally recom-
mended that details of the 15 million
people arrested in the U.S. every year not
be archived at federal level. ACLU says it
will fight the establishment of any genetic
database, which it regards as a Pandora’s
box. It is also contesting in court a recent
Massachusetts law which authorizes dis-
closure of details from the police genetic
d atabase for undefined “ h u m a n i t a ri a n
purposes”.
The easier science makes it to compile
genetic profiles from DNA, the more urgent
it becomes to have effective safeguards
against the possible misuse4 of the genetic

Human Genome, adopted by UNESCO in 1997,
says that “the confidentiality of genetic
information associated with an an identifiable
person” must be protected.

A FRICAN MUSEUMS ON A
MEET-T HE - PEOPLE MISSION
◗ Cynthia Guttman
Plagued by low visitor attendance, African museums are breaking out 
of their rigid colonial moulds and courting local communities
■
Since he started teaching aspiri n g
c u r at o rs in the early 1980s,E m m a n u e l
N n a k e nyi A rinze has advo c ated a
hands-on approach that even comes with a
dress code. “I tell my students that ‘ t h e
A f rican curator does not come to work in a
tie because you are going to be wo r k i n g
with your hands, on objects that are dirty,
in storage, in galleries or outside, or with
children who will pour ink over you.’ ”
I t ’s a small detail that nonetheless points
t owards deeper currents of change ru n n i n g
through A f rican museums as curat o rs and
their colleagues seek to define a model that
makes sense for A f ricans today.The process,
i n i t i ated in piecemeal fashion in the 1980s,
r e c e i ved a galvanizing thrust forward after
M a l i ’s Alpha Oumar Konaré, the first A f ri-
can to preside the Intern ational Council of
M u s e u m s , sounded the alarm by declari n g
in 1991 that “it is time, high time . . . to kill
the We s t e rn model of museum in A f ri c a .”
A crisis had been brewing for ye a rs.
Besides acute cutbacks in financing and trai-
n i n g, e x c e s s i ve bu r e a u c r a cy and political
interference in museum leaders h i p, the most
g l a ring sign of trouble was simply that A f ri-
can people, just about eve ry w h e r e , we r e
shunning their museums. In many cases,
they were discarded as “places for touri s t s
or museums for whites” as Alexis A d a n d é ,
director of the West A f rican Museums Pro-
gramme puts it.
All museums, e ven those founded after
i n d e p e n d e n c e ,were forced to address the cri-
s i s.Across the continent,d i r e c t o rs have star-
ted to shake up their institutions, d e ve l o p
more outward-looking attitudes and tune into
the lives and concerns of local people.T h i s
s t a rts with a novel approach to exhibitions
t h at invo l ves consulting communities from
the outset—not only to spark their interest,
but also because they own objects deemed of
higher symbolic value in their eyes than those
g at h e ring dust in museum show c a s e s.
In Bulawayo (Zimbabwe ) , the local
community was asked to bring in old pho-
t o graphs for display in the local art gallery.
“The exhibition proved ve ry popular as it
rekindled past memories of people’s life-
s t y l e s ,” recalls Francis Musonda, c h a i rm a n
of SADCAMM, an association which
groups museums from the southern A f ri c a
region.
In an experimental-style exhibition in
Ouidah (Benin) in 1985, families we r e
encouraged to display objects relating to local
f e s t i vals and family heri t a g e .The exhibit,s t a-
ged with art i facts ranging from portraits and
masks to statuettes representing female divi-
nities—which until then had been passed
d own within the same families for seve r a l
g e n e r at i o n s — was wa rmly greeted by the
p o p u l ation who for the most part were vie-
wing these precious pieces for the first time.
It created such interest that a small fa m i l y
museum was eventually opened in the city.
Appealing to an elite
In Nigeri a ,A ri n z e , who has held a num-
ber of prominent positions in the field of
museum deve l o p m e n t , organized a crow d -
d r awing exhibition on dru m s , d u ring which
musicians from selected villages were inv i t e d
to a city museum to share their know - h ow
and traditions with visitors. “ People in our
communities must be part of the process of
exhibiting objects that come from them.We
should gi ve them a chance to talk to us about
those objects and how they want to see them
s h own to a wider audience,” he say s.“ W h e n
an object is put here in isolation from its tru e
m e a n i n g, communities feel distanced from
it and slightly offended.”
All these types of initiat i ves enhance com-
m u n i t i e s ’p ride in their heritage and stimulat e
awareness about the value of safeguarding
o b j e c t s , while often shedding new light on
local history.They break the We s t e rn stereo-
type of a museum as a place where people
come to look at objects on display.With some
rare exceptions—such as Niamey’s “ a rts and
c r a f t s ” style concept with architectural
models linked to the country ’s ethnic gr o u p s ,
parks explaining the country ’s fauna and
flo r a , and pavilions presenting different dress
styles and customs—African museums we r e
c r e ated to satisfy the curiosity of an elite,
almost to the total exclusion of the locals.

t h at can serve A f ri c a ’s deve l o p m e n t . “If the
d e finition of a museum is to collect,p r e s e rve
and transmit, this can be applied to a ve ry
broad range of concern s , from learning about
different styles of conflict resolution to iden-
tifying the health practices of different ethnic
gr o u p s ,” she affirm s.
Reaching a youthful audience
Pointing to conflicts that have torn so
m a ny A f rican countries apart in the past
d e c a d e , Tshiluila insists on the potential of
museums to bring about gr e ater unders t a n-
ding between ethnic gr o u p s. In this regard,
Ta n z a n i a ’s Village Museum has drawn at t e n-
tion well beyond its borders. In 1994, t h e
museum launched an annual event duri n g
which one or two ethnic groups (out of about
140) show their culture to others.They bu i l d
or rehabilitate traditional houses, explain to
v i s i t o rs the purpose of va rious cultural art i-
facts used, organize seminars about their his-
t o ry and culture, and share food and music.
Because they are invo l ved in the event from its
i n c e p t i o n , communities are gi ven the chance
to reflect upon what they value most about
their heri t a g e , and to find the most stimula-
ting ways of presenting it to others.
The idea of getting messages across can
extend to a broad range of concern s , f r o m
health or agriculture techniques to urbaniza-
t i o n . In Swaziland for example, c u r at o r

and fostering unity, the fact remains that col-
lections were constituted by foreign powe rs ,
and mostly for their interest alone.
“The gr e at problem for ethnogr a p h i c -
style museums is to think about new ways of
using objects which for the most part have
‘ d i e d ’ ,”explains A d a n d é ,r e f e rring to the intri-
c ate ‘ l i v i n g ’r e l ationship between an object,
such as a mask,and the role it plays in a gi ve n
cultural context. In the case of the palace-
museum in Abomey (Benin), a rt i facts belon-
ging to ru l e rs of the former 17th-century king-
dom are brought out during ritual ceremonies
linked to the cult of ancestors.These objects
are “ c h a r g e d ” to regain their sacred powe r ,
and at the end of the ceremony rendered
i n a n i m at e , since a fully charged object can-
not be left on show for viewing by the ave r a g e
v i s i t o r. But this type of initiat i ve is not feasible
when objects have been collected in one part
of the country for display in another.
But museum directors are still fa c e d
with the question of bri n ging meaning back
into collections constituted during colonial
t i m e s.“Should these objects be returned to
populations to create local museums or be
used for educational purp o s e s , e s p e c i a l l y
for youth from cities?”asks Adandé.

In Namibia, high schools have become key actors in documenting scientific collections

13 per cent error margi n . Pa rticipants recei-

mote Internet deve l o p m e n t .At present, o n l y
28 per cent of Namibia’s 1,600 schools have
a telephone connection, and only a handful
are online. Money allow i n g, the museum
intends to take the model to Zimbabwe and
Z a m b i a . M e a n w h i l e , the contest’s winning

held for the first time in 1999.
The rule: students give the museum a
helping hand by computerizing handwrit-
ten data on its insect collection, the fif t h
largest in A f ri c a . In return , their schools
win computers and Internet access. “ We
have over 1.5 million insects in our ento-

Since the early 1990s, pluralism and
independence have become new
watchwords for media in developing
countries. Regimes that had been authori-
tarian, in some cases since independence,
have genuinely committed themselves to
freedom of the press. Constitutions and
l aws have been amended, codes of
conduct drawn up and press councils
established.
But these developments have not
taken place everywhere, and their results
h ave not always been conclusive .
However, a number of countries have
managed in the last few years to create a
free press in extremely difficult circum-

still going on in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, where 84 journalists have
been imprisoned, media outlets have been
taken over or shut down,newspapers bur-
ned and their offices looted.
Africa, Asia and Latin America have
also seen countless unwa rranted libel
actions, censorship, harassment, arrests
and killings of journalists. Over the last 10
years, 58 journalists have been murdered
in Algeria and 44 in Colombia. Ethiopia
has jailed more journalists than almost
any other country in the world.
But this tragic decade also saw encou-
r a ging changes. UN E S C O helped to point
the way forward in 1988 when it produced
a new communications strategy based on
independence and pluralism.The collapse
of the Soviet bloc depri ved deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries of a point of reference and bac-
k i n g . Since independence, m a ny of these
c o u n t ries had adopted the model of the
o n e - p a rty stat e , which was seen as the only
way to generate the energy needed to tack-
le economic backwa r d n e s s.
The 1990 summit of French-speaking
states at La Baule, in France, called on
the countries of francophone Africa to
introduce more democracy. The English-
speaking states of the Commonwealth,
meeting in Harare (Zimbabwe), the follo-
wing year, followed suit and resolved to
expel countries which did not comply.
This was what happened to Nigeri a ,
Africa’s biggest country, then under mili-
tary rule.
In May 1991, the W i n d h o e k
Declaration, drawn up after a UN E S C O
seminar and later approved by UN E S C O’s
Executive Board, said that an “indepen-
dent, pluralistic and free press” was vital
for “democracy and economic develop-
ment”. The death knell had sounded for
the notion of the media controlled by a
one-party state to promote national deve-
lopment. Similar declarations were made

w i l l , ove r - z e a l o u s n e s s , ignorance and
political and religious pressure.” T h e
press mixed politics with intrusion into
private life, sometimes descending into
the gutter.This led to a vicious circle whe-
reby the authorities used media excesses
as a pretext to strike at the newly-free
media by arresting and jailing journalists.
Many private individuals sued the press.
Côte d’Ivo i r e ’s gove rnment and jour-
n a l i s t s ’ trade unions decided to interve-
ne in September 1995 by drawing up a
code of conduct and establishing a press
council modelled on those in Germ a ny
and Quebec; one half of the members
are publishers , the other half journ a l i s t s.
This gave birth to the Press Freedom
and Professional Ethics Monitor
( O L P E D ) . On World Press Freedom
D ay in 1999, the World A s s o c i ation of
N e w s p a p e rs and the French-based non-
g ove rnmental organization Report e rs
Sans Frontières noted that there we r e
“genuinely independent” press organs in
Côte d’Ivoire and that journalists could
work safely.
Adopting a code of conduct and set-
ting up an independent press council to
monitor its application and hear com-
plaints from the public are the first two
self-regulatory measures taken in develo-
ping countries to head off government
intervention and regulation which would
bring unforeseeable restrictions. In the
d e veloping wo r l d , mechanisms of this
kind also educate the public and promote
press freedom.
A trend is now underway. Press coun-
cils were set up in South Korea, India,
N e p a l , B a n g l a d e s h , S ri Lanka and
Indonesia in the years after 1960. In the
1990s, a dozen more appeared—in the
Philippines and Mozambique in 1991,
Ghana (1992), Nigeria (1992 ; revived in
1999), Fiji (1993), Côte d’Ivoire (1994),
Senegal (1996), and Pe ru , T h a i l a n d ,
South Africa and Tanzania (1997).
Indian communications expert K.S.
Venkateswaran thinks that “an effective
press council can ensure that the reader is
not short-changed by unscrupulous or
shoddy journalistic practices. The council
can give him a platform from which to

forced the government to enact press
freedom measures in 1991 as a prelude to
free elections and the abolition of censor -
ship the following year.
Watchdogs against
bias and inaccuracy
In countries that are sometimes having
their first taste of freedom, excesses and
errors seem almost inevitable, including
press violations of pri va cy, libel and
c a l u m ny, outrageous behaviour and
unwarranted intrusion. Some new jour-
nalists lack experience and training. The
issue of responsibility, which no free
media outlet can dodge, soon arises.
Côte d’Ivoire, which had been marked
since independence in 1960 by censor-
ship and self-censors h i p, is a good
example.The explosion of freedom spaw-
ned about 80 political parties and a hun-
dred or so newspapers and other publica-
tions. Two years later, only a dozen of the
40 daily papers were still appearing and
the government-controlled press had the
upper hand. But the media had become a
forum for debate.
After the media explosion, the press
was criticized for “lack of training and
professional responsibility, t ri v i a l i t y, i l l
The media regulation and self-regulation mecha-
nisms in South Africa consist of:
● A press ombudsman and an appeal panel set
up in 1997 by journalists and publishers’ associa-
tions. The panel is composed of publishers, jour-
nalists, and members of the public, who are in the
m a j o r i ty. It is funded by the newspaper publishers
association (www.inc.co.za/online/ombudsman). Its
p ower is limited to publishing reprimands and cor-
rections which the ombudsman or the panel
consider necessary. Complaints against the press
are lodged by private individuals or institutions
first with the ombudsman, who will try to settle the
m a t t e r. If this fails, the complaint becomes a formal
one. The complainant can appeal against the
ombudsman’s decisions to the appeal panel. At
each stage, discussions between the confli c t i n g
parties are held.
● The Broadcasting Monitoring and Complaints
Committee (BM CC), made up of four members
from the legal profession and the media and chaired
by a working or retired judge. The committee reports
to the Independent Broadcasting Authority, an audio-
visual regulatory body set up by law in 1993. The law
which created the authority provides for rectifica t i o n s
( b r o a d cast on radio and TV), publication paid for by
the guilty party, injunctions, fines and tempora ry
or permanent suspension of broadcasting licences.
The committee examines violations of the codes of
conduct for news and advertising which are part of
the law and also violations of the terms of the licence-
holders’ contra c t s .
● The Advertising Standards Authority, which
monitors advertising and complaints about it.
● The Broadcasting Complaints Commission
( B CCSA), set up in 1993 by the National Broadca s t e r s ’
Association, is an independent regulatory body grou-
ping private and community radio stations, as well as
the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC),
the public service media entity. Its powers are limited
to publication of its decisions. It receives complaints
from the public about violations of the radio and TV
code of conduct it has drawn up. It has to try media-
tion before giving its verdict. ■

ventilate his grievances against biased,
inaccurate or inadequate reporting on
matters of legitimate public interest.”
He points out that a council can act
more quickly and more cheaply than the
c o u rts in cases where “for example, t h e
g ove rnment or a public sector undert a k i n g
is alleged to discri m i n ate unfairly against
c e rtain newspapers in, s ay, the allocation of
a d ve rtising or newsprint (as often happens
in many developing countri e s ) .”
When Algeria set up an information
council in 1990—an institution that could
be criticized on the grounds that half the
members were government representa-
tives and the other half journalists—it was
an unprecedented step towards freedom
of expression in the Arab world.When the
country got caught up in a spiral of
repression in 1994, the council was dis-
s o l ve d . N i g e ri a ’s press council was a
casualty of dictatorship but was revived
after free elections in 1999.
When Morocco began political
reform, a journalistic code of conduct was
adopted and there were calls for a press
council. But the most liberal example of
self-regulation is South Africa, which set
up a system in 1997 (see box) clearly
based on the Swedish model, the oldest
and one of the most respected in Europe.
In Asia, a seminar organized in 1996
by the Asian Media Inform ation and
C o m m u n i c ation Centre (AMIC) in
Singapore and Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn
University revealed that in most Asian
countries press councils were not protec-
ting the local media against attacks on
press freedom or offering ordinary citi-
zens the means to counter abuses by the
media. Since then, however, AMIC has
offered many courses and written mate-
rial about laws and self-regulation mecha-
nisms. A press council has been set up in
Thailand and Indonesia’s press law was
recently amended. A big effort is also
being made in this area by the Asia Press
Fo u n d at i o n , which includes 15 or so
media institutes in the region.
The need for codes of conduct is
bound to increase with the world media
boom. However wide the North-South
gap may be, nothing suggests that the
growth of the media in developing coun-
tries—though too slow and inadequate—
is going to stop. Despite often tragic obs-
t a c l e s , wa rs and economic inequality,
media expansion will continue, even in
developing countries. In two big demo-
cracies, Brazil and India, the circulation
of the daily press grew by 24 per cent and
47 per cent respectively between 1993
and 1997. Such advances involve setting
up or strengthening regulatory and self-
regulatory mechanisms.
A framework
for independence
As soon as a national press achieves a
s i g n i ficant level of organization and
influence, the issue of its responsibility
inevitably arises. Experience has shown
that a press like South Africa’s, despite
the country’s colonial past and history of
d i s c ri m i n at i o n , has inherited cert a i n
structures which were helpful when it
came to devise a self-regulatory mecha-
nism. It was the same in India where,
taking a cue from the British press, the
media played an important part in the
achievement of national independence.
Pakistan, which turned away from such
structures, has had a lot more difficulty
establishing an independent press.
In developing countries where struc-
tures of this kind exist, journalism has a
promising future. A framework for inde-
pendence and pluralism has now been
defined. While it would be a mistake to
ignore the fact that great obstacles lie
ahead, the encouraging progress made so
far must be welcomed. ■

ENKI BILA L :
A JOURNEY TO THE END
OF TIME
In comics, books and movies, a Yugoslav-born French artist visits the future to put the past 
in perspective and wields humour as a weapon against horror
Memory is a recurrent theme in your work
and the leitmotif of your latest book, co-
written with the French novelist Dan Franck.
Its title is Un siècle d’amour—a century of
love—but it’s really about a century of terror.
The creat i ve process is based on
m e m o ry. A rtists are a compound of
memory and sensibility. How could they
talk about humanity and the wo r l d
without delving into history and drawing
on memory—their own and the memory
of society and of nature? Memory can be
more or less prominent in an artist’s
work. But even when it’s scarcely percep-
tible, it’s always the raw material of art.
How do you differentiate between history and
memory?
L e t ’s take the case of Un siècle
d’amour. It isn’t a book about history,
even though it starts in 1914, ends in
1999 and moves from Guernica to the
H o l o c a u s t , Hiroshima and events in
Africa—fairly classic chapters of history.
Each episode evokes the experiences of a
woman caught up in the torment of war.
Dan wrote the stories of these 13 wit-
nesses, victims and heroines of our times.
I painted their portraits. But the book is
not very accurate historically. It starts in
Sarajevo 1914 and ends in Saravejo 1999
and not—as respect for chronology would
have required—with events in Kosovo,
decisive though these were for this book.
Readers should see this as a deliberate act
of infidelity to history rather than an

real time. Such images come to us via two
vehicles of reality, p h o t o gr a p hy and repor-
t i n g . They are part of a language that is
quite different from the art i s t ’s.
So there is a feeling of personal unea-
siness as well as a desire to step back from
reality, to be disconnected from it. But
this doesn’t keep me from returning to
the real world. I visit the future to come
back to the past and the present.
These three dimensions of time often overlap
in your books. The first scene in Le Sommeil
du monstre, for example, takes place in an old
New York yellow cab transformed into a flying
machine. This kind of contemporary detail
ensures that readers don’t feel totally
immersed in a science fiction world.
I don’t want them to be.What’s more,
I find the term science fiction slightly irri-
tating. I am against all kinds of labels,
codifications and classifications in litera-
ture. I don’t think there’s a hard-and-fast
boundary between the worlds of Jules
Verne, George Orwell and H.P. Lovecraft
and those of Baudelaire, Kafka and Poe. I
think the boundaries between genres are
fading away. More and more authors are
weaving the future into their works, whe-
ther they are writing novels or philosophy.
That said, I have loved science fiction
since I was a teenager. Science fiction
enabled me to observe the world in its
cosmic dimension, to have a global vision
of the Earth which influences the ques-
tions I ask about the existence of other life
forms and about the human condition.
What worries you most about today’s world?
Without falling into the trap of “knee-
jerk ecology”, I must say that I am afraid for
our planet. It is becoming weaker all the

T A L K I N G  T O …
48 The UNESCO Courier - April 2000
Nike, the main hero of Le Sommeil du
monstre, battles the “Obscurantis Order”, 
a kind of sect headed by “three new, 
self-proclaimed charismatic leaders”. 
Is that a veiled allusion to 
the three leaders who brought 
about the break-up of Yugoslavia, 
Serbia’s Milosevic, Croatia’s Tudjman and
Bosnia’s Izetbegovic?
The idea for the “Obscurantis Order”
arose from fundamentalism, but readers
are free to make their own interp r e t at i o n s.
T h at ’s the point of the book: e ve ryone can
make of it what they will. T h e r e ’s nothing
to stop people making a connection with
the three war leaders you mentioned, w h o
were fully tolerated and cynically accepted
by Europe. Better things could have been
d o n e . Europe should have intervened as
soon as the rise of nationalism began in
1 9 8 7 . Not necessarily militarily—a carr o t -
and-stick approach could have been used
by say i n g, “ H e y, Europe is under constru c-
t i o n , d o n ’t miss the boat .” At that time,
Yu g o s l avia was better placed than any
other East European country to join the
European Union.
How did you feel about the war that ravaged
the country where you were born?
It hit me like a smack in the face. I’ve
lived in France since 1960, but I was born
in Belgr a d e . My father was from
Herzegovina and my mother came from
Czechoslovakia at the age of two. I spent
the first nine ye a rs of my life in
Yugoslavia. I was born a Yugoslav or, if
you like, a “Yugoslovak”—that’s what I
was called by Alain Resnais, the director
of La vie est un roman, a film for which I
designed the sets.
I loved that country. Split, Dubrovnik,
Sarajevo, Belgrade. I went back as soon as
I could,even though it was to relive child-
hood memories more than anything else.
Then I was sucked into the terrible reali-
ty of the war. But at the same time, I
remained on the outside. A good thirty
years had gone by since I left, I was an
observer, above the fray, I didn’t take any
strong positions.
It was painful. I felt as if I was caught
in the grip of this history, yet at the same
time I tried to stay detached in order to
understand what was going on. I’m not
sure I succeeded. Some situations are
i rr at i o n a l . I saw French intellectuals
taking positions that sometimes seemed
grotesque. I mistrusted these opinions,
even if their basis was sound, even if they
reflected a kind of generosity.
In short, it was a very hard time, but
obviously nowhere near as hard as it was
for the people on the spot. I experienced
and exorcised my anxiety in my own way,
with Le Sommeil du monstre .
The world of that comic book is sombre and
dominated by cold colours. But humour keeps
on breaking through, even at the most tragic
moments. For example, you write, “A rocket
slammed through a wing of the hospital,
causing three casualties, including an innocent
Sony television set that was switched off”.
That is part of the inexplicable rela-
tionship between the author and his work.
I need humour, of course. It defuses cer-
tain situations. It adds a light touch to
stories that would otherwise be utterly
turgid.
On the opening page of La Foire aux
immortels, you quote this passage from the
writings of Choublanc, the Fascist governor of
Paris in 2023: “Immortality is a form of
dictatorship of life over death. As a dictator,
and someone who is alive, all that’s left for
me is to become immortal. And I will! Even if I
die in the process!”
That is a completely way-out comic
book in which Egyptian gods play the
game Monopoly in a flying pyramid that
has run out of fuel and hovers over Paris.
In it I describe the quest for immortality
in its most ludicrous forms. Choublanc,
who believes memory and history are

outdated concepts, will do anything in his
power to achieve immortality. At the same
time, Alcide Nikopol, a deserter launched
into outer space in a flying refrigerator in
1992, falls out of the sky deep-frozen!
This wretched mortal is rescued by the
god Horus, who wants to use his body to
settle his scores with the other Egyptian
deities. Thirty years have gone by. Paris
has changed a lot. Alcide is totally lost.
His memory gradually comes back and,
with it, Baudelaire’s poems, which he
recites all through the events that take
place.The first one describes death at its
most repellent.
I don’t like death. I’m terrified of it
and I’m always thinking about it in a
s o m e w h at abstract way. I ’ ve come to
terms with it as best I can. We might as
well laugh about it, don’t you think?
The monstrous dictator’s name is Choublanc,
which means a loser in French. Is that because
he is doomed to fail? Is there any symbolism
in the names you give your characters?
It’s very odd. Both names and titles
come to me automatically. I don’t know
how it happens or where they come from.
But I do know that I’m incapable of wri-
ting a book or making a film without kno-
wing the title beforehand. It comes out of
the blue. There’s nothing premeditated
about it. When I started the story about
Choublanc, I didn’t even know how it was
going to develop. I already have the title of
my next book, which is a follow-up to Le
Sommeil du monstre. It’s 32 décembre—
“December 32”. When I started writing
32 décembre, I didn’t even known what the
expression meant. Now, one of the book’s
aims is to find a meaning for its title.
Why did you name the head of the
“Obscurantis Order” Warhole? Your female
characters, painted in a dominant colour, owe
something to Andy Warhol.
There’s a pun in Warhole. There’s a
gaping hole over Nike’s head in the hospital
at Sarajevo. But it’s also a deliberate allusion
to Andy Wa r h o l .Names can harbour a host of
m e a n i n g s. In the next book, you’ll see that
Warhole is also an art i s t .An artist of supreme
e v i l . He has decided to turn evil into an art -
form. His geopolitical strategy in the first
book will be replaced by an artistic strat e g y.
You often name your characters after real
people. Nike’s last name is Hatzfeld, a
journalist with the French daily L i b é r a t i o n w h o
was seriously wounded in Sarajevo in 1992. In
Froid Equateur, you allude to the Albanian-
born choreographer Angelin Preljoca j .
To me, news is the raw material for
any projection into the future. I soak up
news, and my story, which is set in the
future, is packed with events from the
present. And if my readers don’t follow
current political events, they are some-
times likely to get lost.
Anjelin is a rather special case. Froid

Palace Hotel and Tykho Moon. Does film-
making involve more constraints than creating
comic strips?
The two activities are worlds apart .
Cinema is nothing but constraints. W h e n
you create a comic book, you don’t have to
think about production costs, s h o o t i n g
l o c at i o n s , equipment and actors.
E ve rything depends on the author, who is
e x t r a o r d i n a rily free. But inherent in that
freedom is the danger of going off the rails.
I l l u s t r at o rs have to harness their freedom
all the time, keep it under control.
But the film industry is changi n g . N e w
tools such as small digital cameras are
enabling younger directors to make mov i e s
with low budgets and, a b ove all, e n j oy
gr e ater freedom than their predecessors. I
think we ’re heading towards a bipolari z a-
tion in cinema. On the one hand spectacu-
lar blockbu s t e rs , on the other a small-scale,
almost underground cinema that is bound
to be ve ry interesting.
How does the world of your comic strips
relate to that of your films?
It’s the same world, the same preoccu-
pations, the same atmosphere. I’ve been
criticized for making “comic strip” films.
That’s completely ridiculous. What on
earth is a “comic strip” film? This false
perception may explain why my films
haven’t really been successful in France.
In Japan, on the other hand, they met
with exceptional acclaim, just like my
books.
The comic strip had a chequered career before
it achieved recognition as the ninth art. Are
comic strip artists well thought of in the world
of the arts?
Personally, I am in a very fortunate
position.I get a lot of media attention,too
much sometimes. I have to be careful.But
in some quarters I still feel there is a cer-
tain contempt for graphic art in general.
In some literary, publishing and even
cinema circles, people still think words
are on a higher plane than pictures.
All the same, in 1992 the editors of the French
literary magazine Lire chose Froid Equateur as
their “book of the year”.
The choice was very badly received
both in the literary world and the comic
strip world.The press didn’t talk about it.
It was pretty funny.
I t ’s odd, but the art world denigr at e s
i l l u s t r ation and comic stri p s. A year ago,
the French magazine B e a u x - A rt s p u b l i s h e d
some stories about the comic strip festival
held in the southwe s t e rn city of A n g o u-
l ê m e . The lead article kicked off by wa r-
ning readers that just because the editors
were publishing a special section about
comic strips it didn’t necessarily mean they
considered them to be art.
Not long before, B e a u x - A rt s had publi-
shed a five-page piece about me.And now all
of a sudden it was as if they regretted it.T h e y
d i d n ’t want to turn off their old subscri b e rs.
But at the same time, they wanted to at t r a c t
younger readers.This is a pretty dishonest
a p p r o a c h .But I’m hopeful.I think the people
who think this way are, f o rt u n at e l y, d o o m e d
either to disappear or to change. ■

Equateur came out in 1992. Two years
later,I designed the sets and costumes for
his Romeo and Juliet. It was an exceptional
and exciting encounter on two counts.
W i d e - e ye d , I discovered the world of
dance, which until then had been pretty
much a closed book to me. At the same
time I came to know a gifted artist who
has since become a friend.
Doesn’t the fact that both of you are from the
Balkans explain Romeo and Juliet’s success?
Of course it does.We have a shared Bal-
kan sensibility. I was immediately won ove r
by the way Anjelin wanted to stage R o m e o
and Juliet—his radical approach, the social
setting of a drama that takes on political and
e ven ethnic ove rt o n e s. It was a deeply ful-
filling experience which gave me an oppor-
tunity to serve not only the wo r l d ’s most
beautiful love story but also an artist who
uses dancers ’ bodies to externalize his ideas.
For an illustrat o r ,i t ’s fa s c i n ating to see how
bodies express themselve s.
The heroine in your book The Woman Trap is
called Jill Bioskop. Her last name means
“cinema” in Serb. Froid Equateur begins and
ends with scenes of a movie being made. Are
you a film buff?
Movies have stimulated my imagina-
tion ever since I was a child.When I was
a teenager, I was fascinated by an art form
which I felt was both close to and parallel
to what I dreamed of doing. Cinema held
an extraordinary attraction, but at the
same time it seemed inaccessible. So I
started drawing , which for me was a way
of making movies freely, alone at home.
Later, you directed two fiction films, Bunker
