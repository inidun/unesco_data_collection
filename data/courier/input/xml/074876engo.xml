This countenance of an apsara, or heavenly nymph, is a detail of a sculpture on the façade
of Vamana Temple at Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh, Central India. Vamana is one of a splen¬
did group of Hindu temples built for the Chandel kings of Bundelkhand between
950 and 1050 A.D. and dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Jain patriarchs. Of the 85 original
temples, only about 20 survive, richly adorned with graceful sculptures wrought in sandstone.
The apsaras carved on Vamana Temple form part of a reconstruction of the heaven of Indra,
lord of the Vedic pantheon.

This double issue of the "Unesco Courier" is a follow-up of
our May 1974 number and is devoted to the impact of popu¬
lation growth on food, the environment, and social and
economic development. Between 19 and 30 August, 1974,
the World Population Conference organized by the United
Nations will be held in Bucharest (Romania). Leading
authorities on demographic problems have prepared various
studies for this conference, which was preceded by a series
of U.N. symposiums held in Cairo, Honolulu, Stockholm and
Amsterdam. Several articles in this issue are based on studies
prepared for these meetings. The Editors have also been
inspired in the preparation of this number by the consid¬
erations on population set forth in a special Unesco study
on 12 major .world problems of today, to be submitted to
Unesco's General Conference next October.

THE
A To link unites the family of man more than
2 \ his need for food. For food is an essential
condition of life, common to all people;
wherever they are, whatever they do, they share
alike in this need.
The stark truth is that man's ability to produce
food is not keeping pace with his need.
Despite efforts by governments and the
international community to solve world food
problems, more people are hungry today than
ever before.
Hundreds of millions of the world's people
are undernourished. Population growth is
adding 75 to 80 million more people each year,
200,000 each day. Within the next 25 years or
so our present numbers of nearly 4 billion
will be nearly 7 billion.* They must
all be fed.
The world food situation took a sharp turn
for the worse in 1 972 and 1 973 :
4
We publish here a "Declaration on Food and Population"', signed
by more than 1,500 prominent citizens of nearly 100 countries,
which was presented to the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, Kurt Waldheim, on 25 April 1974. The signatories
include 16 Nobel Prize-winners as well as distinguished scien¬
tists and scholars, artists, statesmen, economists, and govern¬
ment and non-governmental officials.
1. Stocks of grain have hit an all-time low
since the end of World War II. Surplus stocks
formerly held in reserve have nearly been
exhausted and no longer offer security
against widespread hunger and starvation.
2. Food prices have reached new highs.
Last year, despite a record world harvest,
escalating demand nearly doubled grain prices.
The increasing cost of food threatens to cause
serious hardship for many people already
spending most of what they have on food.
3. Less of the cheaper protein foods, which
normally supplement grain diets, is
available. The world's fish catch and per caput
production of protein-rich legumes, the staple
diet in many countries, have declined.
4. Food shortages have created serious social
unrest in many parts of the world and are
particularly severe in countries where hunger
and the diseases that thrive on under-nourished
bodies are prevalent. This scarcity
has been aggravated by the consumption
of more and more grain to produce meat,
eggs and milk.
5. Mounting fertilizer and energy shortages are
reducing food production in certain areas and
increasing food prices.
In this new and threatening situation, a bad
monsoon in Asia (which could occur in any
year), or a drought in North America (like
those in the 1960's and 1950's), could mean
severe malnutrition for hundreds of millions
and death for many millions.

address this declaration
on food and population
to governments
and men and women everywhere
IMDERSIGKED...
rhis dangerously unstable world food picture,
when seen against an unprecedented
population increase, has created an
immediate sense of urgency. The dangers of
food shortages could remain a threat for the
rest of this centuryeven if, hopefully,
bumper crops in some years create temporary
surpluses and even if the trend toward reduced
birth rates becomes general throughout the
world.
World food production in the years ahead
must rise at least 2 per cent a year to keep pace
with the present rate of population growth. But
it must rise a good deal more if the world's
people are to be provided with an adequate
diet. This required annual increase in food
production is considerably greater than that
which occurred during recent decadesand
seems to be increasingly harder to achieve each
year. But unless there is this necessary and
continuous increase in food production, there
will be even more hunger and malnutrition and
soaring food prices.
The need to seek solutions is pressing. The
nature of the problem, the precarious state of
world food production made critical by
predicted expectations of continued
population growth, calls for concerted action by
the world community. There is only one cure
for hunger and that is food. No palliatives or
panaceas in the form of reports or resolutions
can alleviate the pain of empty stomachs that
must be filled. International resolutions,
however high-minded, are a mockery if they
do not have a tangible impact on the human
condition.
rhe United Nations is now providing
leadership on both these problems. In
August the United Nations will convene the
World Population Conference in Bucharest. In
November it will convene the World Food
Conference in Rome. These are the first
occasions when governments have agreed to
meet to consider these crucial questions and
to consider taking action on them.
With these two conferences only a few
months away, we urge governments, acting
before, at and after these two global
conferences, to consider realistic and purposeful
measures such as the following:
1. Give high priority to programmes in each
country which will increase the production of
grains, legumes and other staple food crops;
ensure the availability of protein-rich foods,
particularly to the more vulnerable population
groups; expand the production of fertilizer;
and improve the opportunities for small
farmers to make a reasonable living. Develop a
comprehensive and constructive World Food
Plan for adoption at the World Food Conference.
2. Support sound population policies relevant
to national needs which respect national
sovereignty and the diversity of social,
economic and cultural conditions; accept and
assure the human right of each couple to decide
for themselves the spacing and size of their
families;** and recognize the corresponding
responsibility of governments to provide their
peoples the information and the means to

policies in a World Population Plan of Action

3. Recognize that the interdependence of the
world community creates an obligation to assist
in the necessary funding of food and population
programmes by both developing and developed
countries. This calls for the elaboration and
implementation of a global strategy by the
United Nations and its family of agencies,
including the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations and the
United Nations Fund for Population Activities.
4. Establish sufficient food reserves through
national and international efforts to provide
continuing vital insurance against food
shortages.
5. Recognize that, in our finite world where
resources are limited, the family of man
must one day, and hopefully fairly soon, bring
birth-rates into reasonable balance with the
lowered death-rates that have been achieved.
Many governments see the need to guide
national policy toward this objective.

*** Resolution 1672 of the United Nations Economic and Social
Council, 1969.
A solution to the present world food crisis
f\ must be found within the next few years.
The social transformation which can lead
to a reduction in the world rate of fertility,
along with lowering the rate of mortality, will
take decades to accomplish. But a start must be
made now because the millions of people being
born each year place a heavy burden on the
resources available to many nations for
education, health, employment and the
maintenance of environmental quality.
A reduction in population growth could help
alleviate this burden. Effective measures toward
resolving both the world food and population
problems must come within a total strategy of
development. Not only is social and economic
development desirable in itself, but also it
contributes to moderating population growth.
All these measures are designed to improve the
quality of life.
In this Declaration, we focus on food because
it is the most critical of the pressures on the
world today. It is the greatest manifestation
of world poverty, which has many aspects.
The absolute numbers of desperately poor are
far greater today than ever before in history.
The need to eradicate acute poverty is being
recognized more than ever as a collective
responsibility. It is a task which global
partnership and the demands of social justice
make imperative.
We repeat, food is crucial because literally
tens of millions of lives are suspended in the
delicate balance between world population and
world food supplies. Growing populations,
denied sufficient food needed for survival, resist
all efforts to secure a peaceful world. With
increased production and more equitable
distribution of food, the future could provide a
prospect of less misery and more hope for
countless people now deprived of the basic
necessities that are their right.
The World Food Conference represents a unique
opportunity. This opportunity must not
be missed. Comprehensive international
agreements must be reached to assure at least
minimal food supplies, with sufficient annual
carry-over stocks. Disastrous breakdowns in the
world food supply can thus be avoided. All
nations may then rest secure in the knowledge
thas this, the most critical of their immediate
problems, is being attacked with wisdom, vigour
and unity of purpose.
In the name of humanity we call upon all
governments and peoples everywhere, rich and
poor, regardless of political and social systems,
to act-to act togetherand to act in time.

Here is the biggest challenge
facing mankind in our time
CAN THE EARTH
FEED THE
GROWING MULTITUDES ?
Roger Revelle

HlUMAN beings use both
water and land for food production;
that is, the transformation of matter and
energy principally solar energy
into a form that can be utilized for
the growth and replacement of human
tissue and to supply energy for human
metabolism. With a high level of agri¬
cultural technology, such as that ap¬
plied to corn growing in Iowa, this
process is about 0.4 per cent efficient.
In other words, the food energy
contained in the portion of the crop
edible by humans is about 0.4 per cent
of the solar energy received on the
planted area in the growing season.
A nearly minimum subsistence diet'
for human beings averages about
2,500 kilocalories per person per day
(a kilocalorie being the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of
one kilogramme of water one degree
centigrade).* From the amount of solar
energy received by an Iowa cornfield,
it can be calculated that the food
. energy required by 24 human beings
can be provided from one hectare at
the level of agricultural technology
employed in that region.
To provide an adequate diet, in¬
cluding high quality protein and pro¬
tective foods such as fruit and vege¬
tables, the equivalent of 4,000 to 5,000
kilocalories per person is desirable. At
the Iowa level of technology, therefore,
every hectare of land might be
expected to sustain, in principle, 12 to
15 persons on an adequate diet. These
figures are for a typical human, an

from the term kilocalorie, and the "calories"
counted by dieters are in fact kilocalories.

average for men, women and children.
In the world as a whole at the pre¬
sent time, there is one hectare of
farm land for every 2.5 living persons,
or nearly ten times the hypothetical
minimum required for a subsistence
diet. Several reasons explain this
apparent excess. Allowing for fallow
periods, the land actually harvested
during any particular year is only about
a half to two-thirds the total cultivated
area. About ten per cent is devoted
to non-food crops such as cotton,
tobacco, rubber, coffee, tea, jute, etc.
Another large fraction is needed to
produce food for livestock, which
from our standpoint are only 10 to
15 per cent efficient; that is, they use
seven to ten times as much food
energy as the energy contained in their
edible products. Also, from 10 to
20 per cent of food crops are destroyed
by pests.
The principal cause, however, is the
low level of agricultural technology in
most parts of the world. Instead of
the 6.4 metric tons grown on a hectare
in Iowa, the average Indian or Pakis¬
tani farmer produces only a little more
than one ton of wheat or rice.
Large parts of the earth's surface
are not now cultivated. The land sur¬
face of the earth outside the ice-cov¬
ered areas of Antarctica and Green¬
land contains about 13 billion hectares.
Climatic and other conditions limit the
potentially arable land to 2.9 billion
hectares, or 22 per cent of the land
surface of the earth, but this is still
more than twice the present cultivated
area, and more than three times the
area actually harvested in any year.

<![CDATA[
Without irrigation, three crops, in
principle, could be grown each year
in the humid tropics, and two crops in
sub-humid regions. Elsewhere only
one crop can be grown without irriga¬
tion. In all, the potential gross cropped
area per year (the cultivated area times
the number of crops), without irrigation,
is 4.5 billion hectares. With irrigation,
the gross cropped area could be
considerably expanded.
At present, irrigation takes little of
the available supply. Less than four
per cent of the total river flow in fact
is used, to irrigate about one per cent
of the land area of the earth. Most
river waters flow to the sea almost
unused by man, and more than half
the water evaporating from the cont¬
inents plays little part in human life.
The potential for irrigation is thus
very large, but it is limited by the
uneven distribution of river runoff
between the different regions. About
a third of the total comes from South
America with less than 15 per cent of
the earth's land, while Africa, which
contains 23 per cent of the land, yields
only 12 per cent of the runoff. Runoff
from south-west Asia, North Africa,
Mexico, the south-western United
States, temperate South America and
Australia is less than five per cent of
the total, yet these regions contain
25 per cent of the land area. As a
result, only 30 per cent of the potential
can actually be irrigated, or about
1.1 billion hectares. This would raise
the potential gross cropped area to
5.6 billion hectares.
If all this land were cultivated, how
many people could the earth feed?
About 10 per cent of the gross
cropped area would still be needed to
grow non-food crops. With appropriate
technology and inputs of production
equivalent to those used in Iowa
(irrigation water, fertilizer, high-yield¬
ing seeds, plant protection, farm tools,
farm machinery and scientific farm
practices), it can be simply calculated
that the remaining hectares could
provide a minimum subsistence diet of
2,500 kilocalories a day for 100 billion
people. That is after allowing 10 per
cent for unavoidable losses and
another three per cent for seed. To
provide an adequate diet equivalent
to 4,000 to 5,000 kilocalories, the po¬
tential gross cropped area would be
sufficient for 50 to 60 billion people, or
about 15 times the present human
population of the earth.
Setting aside the question of
whether such a large population would
be desirable or even possible from
other points of view, we may ask what
the obstacles are to such an expansion
of the earth's cultivated area. These
are of several kinds.
Firstly, some 1.5 billion hectares of
the potential gross cropped area lie
in regions where rainfall is more or
less continuous throughout the year
the humid tropics. No technology
exists today for intensive cultivation of
these lands for food production. With
few exceptions, farmers must still
practise the ancient technique of
" slash and burn " agriculture.
The available evidence, however,
supports the belief that with appro¬
priate technology the humid tropics
could have a tremendous potential for
food production. In the Congo (as it
then was), an oil palm was developed
which when properly grown yielded
about 4,000 kilogrammes per hectare,
whereas the ordinary palm yielded
about 500 kilos. In the Amazon Valley
peppers have been grown successfully
by Japanese immigrants for at least
20 years.
Secondly, much potentially arable^
land is of poor quality. The savannas*

Right, the geometry of farming. The extraordinary
pattern of fields seen here is formed by different
crops grown in narrow strips so as to check wind
or water erosion. Wider use of such techniques
would enable millions of hectares of the world's
wasted land to be used for growing food. Bottom
of page, where every morsel counts an Asian
woman receives a carefully-weighed-out ration
of oil cake to feed her livestock.
^ of South America, and the broad belt
that extends across Africa just south
of the Sahara, contain large areas of
some of the most severely weathered
and leached soils in the world. Their
meagre supply of nutrients is barely
enough to support cropping for two to
four years, after which six to 12 years
or more of fallow are needed.
On the other hand, many of these
soils are permeable to both air and
water, easily penetrated by roots to
great depth, easy to keep in good
tilth and have at least" moderate water
holding capacity. With adequate irri¬
gation, chemical fertilizers and soil
conditioners, they could be made
highly productive of a wide variety of
food crops.
Thirdly, large capital investment is
required. Any major extension of the
earth's cultivated area, even for sub¬
sistence farming, would require a huge
capital input, of the order of $500 to
$1,000 per hectare. The cost of putting
all the potentially arable land outside
the humid tropics into cultivation would
thus be 500 to 1,000 billion dollars.
The latter figure is about equal to the
annual gross national product of the
United States and twice that of all the
less developed countries combined.
Finally, population and potentially
arable land are unevenly distributed.
Most of the uncultivated but arable
land outside the humid tropics is in
the more sparsely populated cont¬
inents. In Europe, 88 per cent of the
potential is already cultivated, in North
America 53 per cent and in the
U.S.S.R. 66 per cent. In Asia the
figure is close to 100 per cent. On the
other hand, only 16 per cent is as yet
under the plough in thinly populated
Australia and New Zealand, 21 per
cent in South America and 32 per cent
in Africa.
These are the lands designated by
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Orga¬
nization (FAO) as " arable land and
land under permanent crops. . . includ-
10
ing land under crops, temporary fallow,
temporary meadows for mowing and
pastures, market and kitchen gardens,
fruit trees, vines, shrubs and t rubber
plantations ".
If one sets the areas cultivated
against the number of mouths to feed,
these disparities take on a grim sig¬
nificance. In Australia and New Zea¬
land, 1.4 hectares are farmed for
every person; in Asia, only 0.3 of a
hectare. In between come the U.S.S.R.
with one hectare per person, North
and South America with 0.9 and 0.4,
respectively, Africa with 0.5 and Europe
with 0.3. That is the position today,
or rather in 1965. Twenty years later,
anticipated population growth will have
reduced the cultivated area per person
in Asia to 0.2 of a hectare, even if
every potential square inch is cropped.
And the population will still be growing.
This anticipated squeeze in Asia
reflects the heavy population density
of a continent containing more than
half the world's people and the already
high percentage of the land under
crops. If the Asian peoples are to
obtain enough food, it will be necess¬
ary therefore to increase yields and
wherever possible to grow two or
three crops per year on each cultivated
hectare, a development that will entail
extensive irrigation. In Europe, too,
the spare land is not there to counter
the projected population increase, but
here demographic growth is relatively
low and the population in any event
is less than a quarter of Asia's.
In other regions, the mobilization of
unused land could more than offset
population growth over the 20 year
period. Australia and New Zealand,
for example, could have 4.8 hectares
per person cultivated by 1985 if all
available land was put to use. Africa
could have one hectare, North America
1.4 hectares, South America 0.9 hec¬
tares, and the U.S.S.R. 1.2 hectares.
These figures allow for projected popu¬
lation growth and do not include the
humid tropics, but again, it should be
remembered, the population will not
stop expanding in 1985.
The largest areas of potentially
arable land are in Africa and South
America. Outside the humid tropics,
630 million hectares with adequate
water remain uncultivated in these
continents. The limiting factors are
not natural resources but economic,
institutional and social-political prob¬
lems. In addition, over 300 million
potentially arable but as yet uncultiva¬
ted hectares exist in North America
and Australia.
Higher technology depends on the
ability of the farmers and the food
industry to purchase many " inputs "
or factors of production from outside
the farm. At the Iowa level of tech¬
nology, energy must be used from
fossil fuels equal to about three-quar¬
ters of the food energy in the crops,
about half of this energy consumption
being represented by irrigation water
and chemical fertilizers. At present,
the less developed countries use, for

<![CDATA[
all purposes, an average of about
400 kilogrammes of coal equivalent
per person per year, corresponding to
an annual use of three million kilo¬
calories per person.
We have already seen that the aver¬
age human requires the equivalent of
4,000 to 5,000 kilocalories a day for
adequate nourishment. Hence, to meet
his dietary needs adequately with high
agricultural technology, a citizen in a
less developed country would need
to use for food production about a
third of all the energy now available to
him. The average person in developed
countries already uses 14 times the
fossil fuel energy required to meet his
agricultural needs.
For the next 20 to 30 years, a
combined three-pronged strategy for
the less developed countries of in¬
creasing multiple cropping, total culti¬
vated areas and yields from each crop,
has been proposed by the FAO. It is
estimated that with a total expenditure
of 48 billion (1970) dollars, the gross
value of crop production could be
increased overall by 124 per cent
between 1962 and 1985 in four devel¬
oping regions: Africa south of the
Sahara, the Near East and north-west
Africa, Asia and the Far East, and
Latin America.
The People's Republic of China and
other centrally planned economies
were omitted from the FAO study, but
even so it covered 44 per cent of the
world's 1962 population. This popula¬
tion was estimated to rise by 80 per
cent through the plan period. Thus the
projected increase in food production
could forge well ahead of population
growth during the 20 years.
During the first eight years of the
FAO plan period, between 1963 and
1971, total production of wheat, rice
and maize in Asia, including the
People's Republic of China, and Latin
America did indeed increase at an
annual rate of 3.5 per cent, or exactly
the rate projected by the FAO for the
23 year period 1962 to 1985. (The
figures for Africa are incomplete). The
corresponding annual rate of popu¬
lation growth in these regions was
2.25 per cent.
The per capita increase in cereal
production in Asia and Latin America
worked out at 15 per cent between
1963 and 1971. Thus, average diets
in those countries, although they are
still close to subsistence level, are
slowly improving.
In the final analysis, we must
recognize that not all land and water
available for human use can be
allocated to agriculture. Cities and
their industries are also consumers of
water. In India, for example, the
Irrigation Commission estimates that
17 per cent of the usable water will
be needed for industrial and municipal
use. The Commission's estimate of a
total water use of 616 billion cubic
metres for irrigating some 80 million
gross cropped hectares is probably
low and there may ultimately be a^

serious conflict for water between
agricultural and industrial and muni¬
cipal users.
To give another example, an intrinsic
feature of the Aswan High Dam is that
the water can be used for another
principal purpose beside irrigation
hydro-electric power. For electric
energy to be used effectively for
industrial production, it must be gen¬
erated at a fairly steady rate throughout
the year. In contrast, agricultural needs
for water vary widely from one season
to another. Hence, if water is released
from the Dam in such a way as to
provide optimum economic benefits for
agriculture, the large fluctuations would
be far from optimum for industry. On
the other hand, if the water is
released in accordance with industrial
demand, there would be too much for
agriculture in winter and not enough
in summer.
In this case, the Dam appears to be
well adapted to satisfy a relatively
high proportion of both needs. In
Lower Egypt, there is an enormous
reservoir of fresh underground water,
equal in volume to several years flow
of the Nile. Some part of this great
underground store could be used for
irrigation to supplement the water
coming from Lake, Nasser.
Conflicts in land use must also be
taken into account. In regions of tra¬
ditional nomad grazing such as the
northwest frontier of Pakistan and the
sub-Saharan savanna belt of Africa,
establishment of modern high-intensity
agriculture encounters serious difficult¬
ies, both from the cultural patterns of
the people and the conflicting needs
of cattlemen and farmers.
Timber industries and agriculture
also conflict in ways that may have
serious economic consequences. A
large fraction of present uncultivated
land is now covered by forests, the
clearing of which for low-yielding
subsistence agriculture may represent
a serious economic loss.
All over Africa the rising generation
is learning to make fuller use of the rich
resources of the continent This boy
has been taught the new skills of farming
in his school-club as part of a swamp
rice improvement project launched in
17 Liberian villages by the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.
Many major irrigation projects, again,
involve the construction of large dams
and reservoirs, which often flood
valuable lands with a high actual and
potential agricultural value," apart from
creating grave problems of resettling
the agricultural peoples displaced.
The growth of cities also commonly
utilizes prime agricultural land. Fortu¬
nately, the total area of cities is usually
under five per cent of the land area
of even a highly urbanized country.
Finally, the social consequences of
an agricultural revolution cannot be
ignored. National farm prices generally
will almost certainly fall because of
greatly expanded production in the
regions in which the new technology
has been successfully applied. The
farmers in other regions may then be
unable to obtain prices sufficient to
pay for the water, chemical fertilizers
and other inputs needed for high-
productivity agriculture. In these
circumstances, they could be forced
back on subsistence farming, but this
would be insufficient to provide for
the growing populations of their
own villages.
If that happens, large numbers of
unskilled countrymen will migrate
either to the towns or to the more
favoured agricultural regions, where
most of them will become landless
labourers. Already, there is mass
unemployment in the towns and no
developing country has solved the
problem of raising employment in the
industrial sector as fast as the growing
labour force. The challenge to policy¬
makers, either to develop new agri¬
cultural technologies for non-irrigated
land, or to provide employment and a
new way of life for these people, will
have to be faced.

A WORLD
GONE MAD
It is time to stop squandering
nature's resources

<![CDATA[
RENE DUMONT is internationally known for
his hard-hitting studies on the plight of rural
populations in developing countries and what
he considers the chaos of the world's econ¬
omic, social and agricultural situations. An
agronomist by profession, he is professor of
agriculture at the National Institute of Agron¬
omy in Paris. His books have appeared in
many languages. "False Start in Africa" and
"The Hungry Future" are published by Praeger,
New York. His latest book, "L'Utopie ou la
Mort" (Utopia or Death), published last year
in French and Greek, will shortly appear in
English. In May 1974, René Dumont was a
candidate for the French presidency, and
based his electoral campaign on the ecologi¬
cal issue.
_ ENS of millions of children
in the poorer countries are being
deprived of normal brain development
as a result of a serious lack of
essential proteins in their diet. This
is perhaps the most heart-rending
crime of our time, though it may not
be the most spectacular or the best
known. If present inequalities in food
distribution continue, untold millions of
children will suffer cerebral under¬
development in the decades ahead.
Those who for a long time have
opposed any kind of contraception,
and who still reject certain forms such
as abortions in the early stages of
pregnancy, unwittingly bear a large
share of responsibility for this intol¬
erable situation. But they are not
alone. The blame must be shared by
all who help to perpetuate an increas¬
ingly inadmissible social situation.
The tragedy is that there would be
more than enough protein sources in
the world to satisfy the minimum needs
of all today's children if these sub¬
stances were distributed rationally and
equally. What happens is that they are
shared out almost solely in proportion
to financial resources, and this leads
to appalling waste.
Powdered milk, for example, is one
of the best sources of protein, but
much of it goes to animals. Over
30 per cent of the world fish catch is
transformed into flour and the per¬
centage is rising and most of it is
used for animal fodder. A good milk
cow consumes six grammes of veg¬
etable protein for every gramme of
milk protein it produces. The wastage
is even higher for beef cattle.
Thus, like mineral and petroleum
reserves, which are also limited, the
semi-rare protein resources of the
world are being woefully squandered

by wealthy countries at the expense
of poor ones.
If proteins were distributed more
fairly there would be enough to go
round, but this would mean a certain
amount of austerity in the eating
habits of the rich, which in turn would
presuppose a social revolution pat¬
terned to some degree on that of China.
A Food and Agriculture Organization
nutrition expert has shown that if we
tried to combat undernourishment
simply by increasing production without
altering distribution, we should have to
increase the food production of the
so-called developing countries sixfold
between 1970 and the year 2000, a
task which is obviously impossible.
The first conclusion to be drawn is
this: if we really wish to overcome
malnutrition, it is absolutely essential
to improve food distribution by making
it no longer depend on the buying
power of the individual. It has been
calculated that present world food
production would only satisfy or
should we say gorge a billion persons
if they were all to eat as much as most
people in the United States do. And
the world's population is almost four
billion already! Current industrial
output, moreover, could only satisfy
600 million such avid consumers.
Our world has gone mad. It has
lost all control, both over its population
growth and its production techniques.
In some places people are over¬
worked, while more and more young
people in the Third World are un¬
employed. Above all there is the
unbridled rise of the consumer society,
most blatantly exemplified by the cult
of tfie private motor car.
Attempts to boost food production
alone are therefore not enough, though
they remain none the less an absolute
must. This, of course, is the specific
task of agronomists like myself.
When the FAO completed its Indica¬
tive World Plan in 1969-1970, it esti¬
mated that the "backward" countries
would have to achieve an agricultural
growth rate of 3.8 per cent per year
in order to eliminate most of their
malnutrition by 1985, the end of the
period under consideration.
Twelve years have now gone by
since the beginning of the base year,
1962, and in those twelve years these
countries have fallen further behind.
Although it is difficult to make a
precise assessment, it seems more
than likely that the poor countries are,
on average, as undernourished as they
were before the Second World War.
It even seems quite probable that the
poorer classes in India, Bangladesh
and most of the Andean mountain
regions are less well nourished than
they were in the eighteenth century,
periods of famine apart.
In 1970, which marked the beginning
of the Second Development Decade,
it was foreseen that an annual growth
rate of 4 per cent in food production
would be necessary in order to make
up for the accumulated deficit. But
at the end of November 1972, Mr. A. H.
Boerma, Director-General of FAO,
pointed out that in the first two years
of the decade the increase in food
production had barely exceeded 1 per
cent a year whereas population in the
countries concerned had increased by
over 2.5 per cent.
Unless an extraordinary effort was
made, he concluded, unless a miracle
took place, the Second Development
Decade was already doomed to fail in
agriculture. Miracles, alas, are not the
agronomist's speciality; he is much too
realistic and down to earth to envisage
such possibilities.
He can only issue a serious warning
to any demographers who still think
it impossible to bring about a rapid
reduction in population growth and
who consider the ageing of society
more ominous than over-population.
He may also address a timely word to
governments responsible for civic
education, a tool of which far more
use could be made.
If the experts are unable to work
out a co-ordinated programme designed
to halt population increase, then we
face the prospect of a series of
catastrophes, whose precise nature no
one can predict at this stage. Everyone
has a responsibility in this matter.
The Green Revolution, it is true, gave
promise of miracles, and it would be
wrong to underestimate its achieve¬
ments. New tropical cereal seeds,
including wheat, rice and maize, now
have a potential comparable to those
of their counterparts in the temperate
zones a dramatic change from the
situation twenty years ago.
From Mexico to Pakistan and north¬
west India, the so-called Mexican
wheat, cultivated in irrigated fields,
often on a large scale, by farmers
who have financial backing and new
techniques at their disposal, has been
a great success. In India alone wheat
production jumped from 12 to 26 million
tons in a six-year period.
The picture is more mixed in the
rice fields. In the Philippines the rate
of growth of the new miracle rice is
still erratic. In Java, Sri Lanka (Ceylon),
Bangladesh and India the yields of the
seeds developed at the International
Rice Research Institute at Los Baños
(Philippines) have so far been ex¬
tremely disappointing.
Too many rice fields in these
countries are still only rain-fed, un-
levelled and dependent on the irregu¬
larities of the monsoon. When the
government builds an irrigation net¬
work, it sometimes leaves the farmers
to install the final channels to connect
their land to the water mains, and
this they usually fail to do.
In Sri Lanka, on the other hand, r
-
"Every car you buy usually long before you have worn out the one
you've got means that farmers in the tropics will have so much less
steel for the ploughs they desperately need to lighten their burden
and increase their productivity".

irrigation water is provided free of
charge, or virtually so, and hence it
is distressingly wasted. Each hectare
receives three or four times as much
water as it needs, and this means that
three or four fewer harvests are being
irrigated. Employment is consequently
on the down grade.
The existence of 800,000 unemployed
in this little country caused its young
"intellectuals" to revolt. In point of
fact, they are more interested in a
steady office job than standing bare¬
foot in the mud of the rice paddies,
like their Chinese counterparts.
In Bangladesh only 320,000 hectares,
out of a total of nine million under
cultivation, are irrigated in the dry
season, yet this is the most favourable
period for watering. If all the pumps
and tubed wells that are available
were fully used, it would be possible
to irrigate three times as much land,
but these facilities are rented to
farmers for a tenth of their cost and
only a third of their capacity is used.
To cap all, a number of them are
completely out of order and those in
charge of them have little incentive to
repair them, since they know that they
will receive their wages in any event.
There are also 250,000 hectares
of ponds and reservoirs in Bangla¬
desh, but three-quarters of their
area 190,000 hectares have gradu¬
ally become choked with earth. If
they were excavated to an average
depth of two metres or more, 4,000
million cubic metres of food-producing
water would immediately collect, since
these pools could be stocked with
fish or used as irrigation reservoirs.
This project would provide 2,000
million man-days, or in other words,
100 extra days of work over a period
of five years for four million landless
men who at present are unemployed
for just such a period every year.
The increase in the irrigation po¬
tential thus achieved would then bring
about full employment provided, of
course, that the population explosion
was halted. The cost could easily be
met by levying a property tax on the
rice fields and on disused reservoirs,
and allowing for a moderate rate of
inflation (as in Germany in 1933).
A report by the World Bank,
however, states that "reasonable
expectations" for Bangladesh are a
population that will amount to 140-
170 million inhabitants by the year 2000,
with "a total percentage of rural un¬
employment remaining constant at
30 per cent, in the 30 years between
1970 and 2000." The report takes no
account of the possible mobilization
of the labour of the rural population,
and all the extensions to the irrigation
system it foresees will be provided
by external aid. Similarly, increased
output will be the result of using
chemical fertilizers and insecticides,
with little effort being made to utilize
organic fertilizers and other means.
As early as 1960 a vast co-operative
experiment was made in Bangladesh
then East Pakistan by grouping small
farmers who owned at least one acre
of land into village co-operatives
where they could deposit their savings,
borrow money and find an organized
community framework.
A meeting was held each week at
which everyone deposited a quarter
of a rupee about $0.13 at the current
official rate of exchange in his sav¬
ings account, listened to the advice
which the "model-farmer" of the village
had obtained from the technicians of
the district, etc. Substantial loans
were soon granted to try to spread
the Green Revolution more quickly.
But repayment began to lag in 1967
and a number of village co-operatives
are now in a state of actual or virtual
bankruptcy. The production of IR 8
rice and vegetables has considerably
increased, but most of the farmers
even in the vicinity of Comilla, which
was the hub of this experiment and
gave it its name, were still in debt
to private money-lenders when I visited
them in January 1973.
The landless 20 per cent of the
population and the 25 per. cent who
own less than one acre are not ad¬
mitted to the co-operatives and are
sometimes excluded from other advan¬
tages. Tenant farmers are still obliged
to turn over half of the harvest to a
landowner who usually does not con¬
tribute to cultivation costs. Landless
persons can find work as hired hands
for only eight months a year; during
the other four, they say, "we eat one
meal a day instead of three."
How is it possible to turn the unem¬
ployment of this half of the population
to account so long as most of their
earnings continue to go to the land¬
owners, the money-lenders and trades¬
men? Women are traditionally confined
to the house and its precincts because
they would be disgraced if they went
out to the fields, yet in China, Vietnam
and India, women take part in replant¬
ing, weeding and harvesting.
In the northern part of Senegal, in
the region around Louga, when tradi¬
tional methods of cultivation were
used, the land was allowed to lie
fallow for long periods of time and
this kept the soil structure in good
condition. With the unchecked in¬
crease in population and in the acreage
which had to be devoted to the ground¬
nut crop, fallow land has been reduced
indeed, in the already overpopulated
area inhabited by the Serer people,
sometimes even totally eliminated
and thus the amount of humus in the
soil has been reduced.
As a result, the less solid compo¬
nents, such as fine sand and loam,
are not held firmly in the soil, but get
blown away by the wind. What remains
is mostly coarse sand which does not
retain the water from the all too irre¬
gular and infrequent rainfalls. A simi¬
lar situation is found in the semi-arid
belt that stretches across Africa from
Mauritania to Chad and the Sudan,
and south to Tanzania.
The drought in these regions in

eration ought to be to triple food
production between now and the

development is now a basic aim for
all the nations in the Third World".

1972 caused a wholesale loss of
cattle. Over-pasturing has destroyed
all vegetation in the proximity of wells.
Farther away some dry grass still
grows but there is no water to drink.
Some cattle are therefore doomed to
die either from hunger or thirst. Mean¬
while the inhabitants of these regions
are suffering great privations and are
dying in increasing numbers.
The vast agricultural expanses of the
Soviet Union one hectare per inhab¬
itant plus extensive pasture-land and
forests can, of course, be greatly
affected by cold and drought. Never¬
theless, the country should have been
able to accumulate enough grain
reserves, after the excellent harvests
in 1970 and 1971, to avoid the necessity
of buying so much wheat in 1972-
1973. What it did purchase, mainly
because it feeds its cattle on grain,
is no longer available for famine-
stricken areas elsewhere, and these
areas can no longer pay the high prices
caused by world shortages.
The well-to-do countries eat too
much meat produced from cereals and
are therefore unable to give proper
aid to the poorer countries. A world
sugar shortage is also impending, and
the scarcity of beef is going to make
the inequalities between rich and poor
even more glaring.
Since 1960 some effort has been
made in Central America to raise cattle
production on the latifundia where the
pastos naturales (natural pasture-
lands) had an incredibly low output.
In the western part of the Venezuelan
state of Guárico which lies within the
llanos of the Orinoco River, I estimated
in 1959 that one hectare yielded 5 kg.
of meat (live weight) per year!
The large estates in Guatemala, par¬
ticularly, have since improved their
pastos and installed slaughter-houses
so that they can export their beef,
boned and refrigerated, to the United
States where consumption by the well-
off, who form the greater part of the
population, is constantly rising.
Increased exportation has naturally
driven the price of meat up at home
and this has led to a drop in con¬
sumption, to between 11 and 15 kg. a
year per person in many places, in a
country where the great majority are
already poor enough. The disparity in
protein nourishment between the pri¬
vileged few and the many who remain
poor, or who are becoming poorer, is
therefore constantly widening.
These new resources thus do not by
any means constitute, as was hoped,
a springboard for agricultural develop¬
ment and thus for the national economy
as a whole. Where land is so unevenly
distributed, the great majority of the
holdings are inevitably too small to
be able to feed the livestock they are
required to support. Small farmers
have 15 per cent of the country's
cattle, but they own only 3 per cent
of the grazing lands and are without
the means to improve them.
The enormous agricultural potential

lands of "Indian" (as opposed to
"Latin") America is thus largely left
dormant and unproductive. The Brazil¬
ian "miracle", like the Green Revolu¬
tion in India, is only making the rich
richer and the poor poorer.
It does not leave the small producers
the minimum buying power that would
stimulate a widespread development of
vegetable gardening and hence a more
general revitalization of agriculture.
Central and South America, which are
so rich in potential resources, are not
even able to make their food produc¬
tion keep pace with their population
growth. The agrarian reform in Peru
is an attempt to redress this situation,
so far without brilliant results.
It was thought in 1950 that educa¬
tion was the key factor in all develop¬
ment, even more important than the
accumulation of capital. It is indeed
true that capital, to be used to good
effect, requires a wealth of knowledge.
The crime of crimes was com¬
mitted, however, when the schools
began teaching or at any rate ins¬
tilling in students a disdain for ma¬
nual labour, especially that of the
farmer, who was "soiled" with mud
or dust, depending on the season. In
a traditionally stratified society, work
on the land was already generally
considered sufficiently "degrading".
The farmer's children, anxious for
social advancement, consequently
and in a sense, rightly wished to rise
above such "degradation" and this led
them to see in school a means of
escaping from their dependence on
the land. As a result, schools in the
tropics have been swelling the num¬
bers of the unemployable.
The Chinese model is more interest¬
ing. In China all children begin their
education in an environment where
work and study are constantly blended,
and this, together with their civic train¬
ing, helps inculcate in them a respect
for work and for workers.
Wage differences are kept to a
minimum, which prevents the import¬
ing of luxury items. "Relying on its
own strength" and "walking on its own
two feet", China is modernizing its
technology only to the extent that
this does not cause unemployment or
require too much buying abroad. Out
of necessity all by-products are used
and therefore it wastes much less than
richer countries.
This is not to say that I consider
China to be politically and econo¬
mically perfect. Its rate of agricultural
development seems low to me, and
even somewhat lower than I thought
might be expected from the total re¬
organization of the agrarian structure
and the wide extension of irrigation.
More than two-thirds of Chinese
fields are irrigated, compared with
only slightly over a quarter of the
fields in India, yet China's harvest
was only twice that of India, even in a
dry year (1972), for something like 750
million inhabitants. China, however,
is developing its agriculture without
unemployment and without foreign aid.
Admittedly an exact duplication of the
Chinese model elsewhere would be
ill-advised. Fundamental differences,
such as historical heritage, traditional
outlook, social structure, and espe¬
cially recent political history, must all
be taken into account.
China is not a country or a nation
in the Western sense of those terms.
It is a continent, very much larger and
more populous than the whole of
Europe. It has abundant natural
resources which it has skilfully
located and learned to exploit and
lives largely cut off from outside
influences.
None the less, many of the princi¬
ples followed in China deserve to be
studied, to see whether, and to what
extent, they can be adapted else¬
where. Let there be no mistake on
one point, however: they will often
require as an inescapable condition
the abolition of privileges, and conse¬
quently a genuine social revolution.
Even without a revolution on the
Chinese model, there are many ways
in which education might be comple¬
tely transformed, as it must be if there
is to be the kind of general change
in outlook that would lead to a more
egalitarian society.

HREE dangerous fallacies
appear to be widespread with regard
to population growth, environmental
deterioration and resource depletion.
The first is that the absolute size
and rate of growth of the human popu¬
lation has little or no relationship to
the rapidly escalating ecological prob¬
lems facing mankind.
The second is that environmental
deterioration consists primarily of
" pollution ", which is perceived as a
local and reversible phenomenon of
concern mainly for its effects on
human health.
The third fallacy is that science and
technology can overcome all prob¬
lems arising from the scale and rate
of growth.
Environmental problems can be
classified according to the direct or
indirect nature of the damage to
human beings.
Direct assaults include obvious

and services, social disruption (for
example, displacement of people by
mining operations or hydroelectric pro-

ceive as their "quality of life", such as
congestion, noise and litter.
Indirect harm is caused by interfer¬
ence with the services provided for
society by natural biological systems.
Examples are diminution of ocean pro¬
ductivity by pollution of coastal waters
and acceleration of erosion by logging
or overgrazing.
Most of the attention devoted to
environmental matters has been
focused on the direct effects. This is
only natural. It would be wrong,
however, to interpret limited legislative
and technical progress toward amelio¬
rating the direct symptoms of environ¬
mental damage as evidence that so¬
ciety is on its way to an orderly reso¬
lution of its environmental problems.
The most serious threats of all may
well prove to be the indirect ones
generated by man's disruption of the
functioning of the natural environment.
The most obvious services provided
for humanity by the natural environ¬
ment have to do with food production.
The fertility of the soil is maintained
by the plants, animals, and micro¬
organisms that participate in the great
nutrient cycles, and soil itself is pro¬
duced by the joint action of bacteria,
fungi, worms, soil mites, and insects.
The best protection against erosion of
soil and flooding is natural vegetation.
Insects pollinate most vegetables,
fruits, and berries. Most fish the

disease also are controlled principally
not by medical technology but by
environmental conditions.
At many stages of the nutrient cy¬
cles, organisms accomplish what hu¬
mans have not yet learned to do
the complete conversion of wastes
into resources. Human society de¬
pends on these natural processes to
recycle many of its own wastes, such
as sewage, detergents and industrial
effluents. The environmental concen¬
trations of ammonia, nitrites and hy¬
drogen sulphide all poisonous are
biologically controlled.
These public-service functions of the .
global environment cannot be replaced
by technology now or in the foresee¬
able future. The sheer size of the task
dwarfs civilization's capacity to finance,

by technological means, and when all
mankind will live in surroundings as
sterile and as thoroughly managed
as those of an Apollo space capsule.
Until that improbable future arrives
and it may never come the ser¬
vices provided by the orderly operation
of natural biological processes will
continue to be irreplaceable as well
as indispensable.
Ecological disruption on a large
scale by human beings is not a new
phenomenon. One of the best known
early examples is the conversion to
desert of the lush Tigris and Euphrates
valleys, through erosion and salt accu¬
mulation resulting from faulty irrigation
practices. Overgrazing and poor culti¬
vation practices have contributed over
the millenia to the expansion of the
Sahara Desert, a process that con¬
tinues today.
Much of Europe and Asia were
deforested by pre-industrial men,
beginning in the Stone Age; heavy
erosion, recurrent flooding and the
nearly permanent loss of a valuable
resource were the result. Overgrazing
by the Navajo has destroyed large
tracts of once prime pastureland in
the American southwest.
Attempts to cultivate too intensively
the fragile soils of tropical rainforest
areas are suspected of being at least
in part responsible for the collapse of
the Mayan civilization in Central
America and that of the Khmers in
what today is Cambodia.
Agriculture is a simplifier of ecosys¬
tems, replacing complex natural bio¬
logical communities with . relatively
simple man-made ones based on a
few strains of crops. Being less com¬
plex, agricultural communities tend to
be less stable than their natural coun¬
terparts; they are vulnerable to inva¬
sions by weeds, insect pests and plant
diseases, and they are particularly
sensitive to variations of climate.
The Irish potato famine of the last
century is perhaps the best known
example of the collapse of a single
agricultural ecosystem. The heavy
reliance on a single crop led to
1.5 million deaths when the potato
monoculture fell victim to a fungus.
Advances in agricultural technology
in the last hundred years have aggra¬
vated the ecological dilemma. The
dilemma can be summarized thus: civi¬
lization tries to maximize productivity,
while nature operates in a way that
maximizes stability, and the two goals
are incompatible.
Ecological research has shown that
the most complex and therefore most
stable ecosystems have the smallest
net productivity. In short, productivity
is achieved at the expense of stability.
Yet mankind must practise agriculture.
A tendency toward instability must be
accepted and, where possible, com¬
pensated for by technology. But the
trends in modern agriculture are espe¬
cially worrisome ecologically.
There are four major liabilities.
As larger and larger areas are
given over to farming, the areas left to
carry out the public-service functions
of natural ecosystems become smaller
and fewer.
Pressure to expand the area under
agriculture is leading to attempts to
cultivate land that is unsuitable for
cultivation with the technologies at
hand. To give but one example among
many, attempts to apply the techniques
of temperate-zone agriculture to the
tropical soils of Brazil and southern
Sudan have led to erosion, loss of
nutrients, and degradation into the
rock-like material called latérite.
Attempts to maximize yields have
led to dramatic increases in the use
of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers.
These attempts have led also to
the replacement of a wide variety of
traditional crop varieties all over the
world with a few, specially bred
strains. Unprecedented areas are now
planted with a single variety of wheat
or rice. This has increased both the.
probability and the potential magnitude*

havoc with life In lakes and rivers

are trying to develop new kinds of
non-harmful detergents. The damage
caused by industrial waste is
another formidable problem facing
modern society today.

k of epidemic crop failure from insects
or from disease.
A continuing industrial revolution
has multiplied many times over both
the magnitude and variety of the
substances introduced into the bio¬
logical environment by man. These
may be classified as qualitative pollu¬
tants (synthetic substances produced
and released only by man) and quanti¬
tative pollutants (natural substances
released by man in significant addi¬
tional amounts).
Well known qualitative pollutants
are the chlorinated hydrocarbon pesti¬
cides, such as DDT, and some herbi¬
cides. These substances are biologi¬
cally active, but since natural orga¬
nisms have had no experience with
them over evolutionary time they are
usually not easily biodegradable.
Their potential for disruption of eco¬
systems is enormous.
There are three criteria by which
quantitative pollutants may be judged
significant.
-Man can perturb a natural cycle
with a large amount of a substance
ordinarily considered innocuous, as we
do when we over-fertilize.
A relatively small amount of a
substance can cause great damage if
released in a sensitive spot, over a
small area, or suddenly for example,
the destruction of coral reefs in
Hawaii by silt from construction sites.
Any addition of a substance that
can be harmful at its natural concen¬
tration must be considered significant.
Some radioactive substances fall in
this category.
The effects on the public-service
functions performed by ecosystems
are varied and serious. Food chains,
for example, are shortened by the
selective loss of the predators at the
top. This is so because predators are
more sensitive to environmental stres¬
ses of all kinds than are herbivores.
In marine ecosystems the top pre¬
dators are generally precisely the food
fishes most highly prized by man. On
land the loss of predators releases
checks on herbivorous pests that
compete with man for his supply of
staple crops, a good example being
the increase of cotton pests in parts
of Peru. The loss of structure also in¬
creases the load on the process of
decay, already heavily stressed by
man's domestic and agricultural wastes.
The ocean, indispensable as a
source of animal protein, may be the
most vulnerable ecosystem of all. Its
vast bulk is deceiving. Over 99 per
cent of the ocean's productivity takes
place beneath 10 per cent of its sur¬
face area, and half of the productiv¬
ity is concentrated in coastal up-
wellings amounting to only 0.1 per
cent of the surface.
The reason is that productivity
requires nutrients, which are most
abundant near the bottom, and sun¬
light, available only near the top.
Only in shallow waters are both avail¬
able in the same place. The coastal
regions also receive most of the oil
spills, fallout from atmospheric pollu¬
tants and river outflow bearing pesti¬
cide and fertilizer residues, heavy
metals and industrial chemicals.
Overfishing is almost certainly also
taking a heavy toll in the ocean.
Since World War II, the catches of the
East Asian sardine, the California sar¬
dine, the north-west Pacific salmon,
the Scandinavian herring and the Ba¬
rents Sea cod, among others, have
entered declines from which there has
been no sign of recovery. Present
world fisheries production of somewhat
over 60 million metric tons per year
is already approaching the 100 million
that some marine biologists consider
to be the maximum sustainable yield.

Many people still imagine that
mankind is a puny force in the global
scale of things. This is not so. As a
geological and biological force, man¬
kind is today becoming comparable to
and even exceeding many natural
processes.
Oil added to the oceans in 1969
from tanker spills, offshore production,
routine shipping operations and refin¬
ery wastes exceeded natural seepage
by an estimated 20 times.
Man is now contributing half as
much as nature to the atmospheric
sulphur burden and will be contribut¬
ing as much as nature by the year
2000. In industrial areas, the input
of sulphur dioxide so overwhelms
natural removal processes that in¬
creased concentrations are being
found hundreds to thousands of
kilometres downwind.
Combustion of fossil fuels has in¬
creased the global atmospheric con
centration of carbon dioxide by 10 per
cent since the turn of the century.
Such figures do not prove that
disaster is upon us, but they are
cause for uneasiness. Mankind is for
the first time operating on a level at
which global balances could hinge on
our mistakes.
At least one environmental problem
is absolutely intractable, and that is
the discharge of waste heat which
accompanies consumption of energy.
All the energy we use as well as that
we waste in. generating electricity
ultimately enters the environment as
waste heat. Obvious examples are
the heat from a light bulb and the heat
from an automobile engine.
The heat production resulting from
man's use of energy is not yet a
significant fraction of the solar energy
at the earth's surface over the world
as a whole. Even if the present five
per cent per annum rate of increase
persists, it will take another century
before civilization is discharging heat
equivalent to one per cent of solar
radiation. Considerably sooner, how¬
ever, it could become a significant
influence on regional and continental
climate.
Human heat production already
exceeds 5 per cent of solar radiation
over local areas of tens of thousands
of square kilometres, and could exceed
this level over areas of millions of
square kilometres by the year 2000.
Such figures could imply substantial
climatic disruptions.
Man also has the potential to dis¬
rupt climate through additions of
various pollutants to the atmosphere.
The consequences of climatic altera¬
tion reside not in any direct sensi¬
tivity of humans to moderate changes
in temperature or moisture, but rather
in the great sensitivity of food pro¬
duction to such changes.

k The effect of climate on agriculture
was once again being dramatically
demonstrated in early 1973. Famine
was widespread in sub-Saharan Africa,
and was starting in India. South-east
Asia had small rice harvests, parts of
Latin America were short of food.
Crops were threatened in the United
States and the Soviet Union. Over¬
population is dramatically demon¬
strated in mankind's inability to store
sufficient carry-over food supplies in
anticipation of the climatic events
which are a regular feature of the
planet Earth.
How and how much do population
variables themselves contribute to
ecological problems? The most ele¬
mentary relation is that population size
acts as a multiplier of the environ¬
mental damage caused by each indi¬
vidual. The important point here is
that slowly growing factors, when they
multiply each other, lead to rapidly
growing products.
A simple example is the emission
of lead into the atmosphere by auto¬
mobiles in the United States. Vehicle-
miles per person doubled between
1946 and 1967, while emissions of lead
per vehicle-mile increased 83 per cent.
The United States population increased
41 per cent. The result was that more
than five times as much lead was
being discharged into the atmosphere
as 20 years before, and this dramatic
increase arose from rather moderate
24
but simultaneous increases in the
contributing factors.
There is however a. more difficult
and perhaps more important question
than this arithmetical one. A small
increase in population may generate a
large increase in environmental dis¬
ruption. These effects fall into two
classes. First, population change may
itself cause changes in consumption
per person. Second, a small increase
in impact upon the environment
generated in part by population
change and in part by changes in the
other multiplicative factors may sti¬
mulate a disproportionately large en¬
vironmental change.
An obvious example is the growth
of suburbs in the United States, which
has had the effect of increasing the
use of the automobile. Another is
that of diminishing returns in agri¬
culture, in which the increases in
yield needed to feed new mouths can
be achieved only by disproportionate
increases in inputs such as fertilizer
and pesticides. In each case, the
contributing factors can no longer be
considered to be independent. It is
what the mathematicians call a non-
linear relationship.
Environmental disruption cannot be
measured only by man's inputs.
Equally important is how the environ¬
ment responds, and this response
itself is often non-linear. One example
is the existence of thresholds in the
response of individual organisms to
poisons and other forms of stress.
Fish may be able to tolerate a 10-de-
gree rise in water temperature without
ill effect, whereas a 12-degree rise
would be fatal.
Another non-linear phenomenon is
the simultaneous action of two or more
inputs. A disturbing example is the
combined effect of DDT and oil spills
in coastal waters. DDT is not very
soluble in sea water, so the concen¬
trations to which marine organisms
are ordinarily exposed are small.
However, DDT is very soluble in oil.
Oil spills therefore have the effect of
concentrating DDT in the surface layer
of the ocean where much of the oil
remains, and where many marine
organisms spend part of their time.
As a result, the combined effect of
oil and DDT probably far exceeds
their individual effects.
Some forms of non-linearity would
occur eventually whether population
grew or not. For example, a constant
]]>

demand for copper that persisted for
a long time would lead eventually to
substitution of other metals in some
applications. In such instances, popu¬
lation growth accelerates the onset of
diminishing returns, so leaving less
time to deal with the problems and
increasing the chances of mistakes.
In other cases, such as the effects of
population concentration on certain
forms of consumption, population
change is clearly the sole and direct
cause of the non-linear response.
All rational observers agree that no
physical quantity can grow forever.
This is true of population, the produc¬
tion of energy and other raw materials
and the generation of wastes. But is
there anything about the 1970s as
opposed, say to the 1920s or 1870s
to make this the decade in which
limits to growth become apparent?
When limits do appear, they will
appear suddenly. Such behaviour is
typical of exponential growth; that is,
where the quantity multiplies at a
more or less constant rate with
compound interest, so to speak. If a
quantity can double 20 times before
a limit is reached, the system will be
less than half loaded for the first
nineteen doublings, or for 95 per cent
of the time between initiation of growth
and exceeding the limit. Clearly, then,
a long history of exponential growth
does not imply a long future.
The human population is growing at
a rate that would double our numbers
in 35 years, and ecological impact is
growing even faster. The 1970 Study
of Critical Environmental Problems,
sponsored by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, estimated that
man's demands upon the biological
environment are increasing at about
five per cent per year, corresponding
to a doubling time of 14 years. Con¬
tinuation of this rate implies that, if
the environment could absorb, say, as
much as 32 times the 1970 level of
damaging inputs, the limit would be
reached by the year 2040.
The -likelihood of overshooting the
limit is increased by the momentum
of population growth, by time-delays
between cause and effect in many
environmental systems, and by the fact
that some kinds' of damage are irre¬
versible by the time they are visible.
The momentum of human population
growth has its origins in deep-seated
attitudes toward reproduction and in
the age composition of the world's
population, 37 per cent being under
15 years of age. Even if every couple
in the world henceforth had only the
number of children needed to replace
themselves, the imbalance between
young and old would cause population
to grow for 50 to 70 years more before
leveling off. Under extraordinarily
optimistic assumptions, world popula¬
tion could not stabilize below eight
billion people.
Environmental time delays come
about in a variety of ways. Some
substances persist in dangerous form
long after they have been introduced
into the environment. Mercury, lead,
DDT and its relatives and certain
radioactive materials are obvious
examples. They may be entering food
chains from soil, water and marine
sediments for years after being de¬
posited there. Time lags usually mean
that when the symptoms finally appear,
corrective action is ineffective or
impossible. Species that have been
eradicated cannot be restored. Soil
that has been washed or blown away
can be replaced by natural processes
only on a time scale of centuries.
The momentum of growth, the time
delays between causes and effects and
the irreversibility of many kinds of
damage all increase the chances
that mankind may temporarily exceed
the carrying capacity of the biological
environment. Agricultural failures on
a large scale, dramatic loss of fisheries
productivity and epidemic disease are
among the possible consequences.
The evidence suggests that such
possibilities exist within a time frame
measured in decades, rather than cen¬
turies. This is not to suggest that the
situation is hopeless. The point is
rather that the potential for grave
damage is real and that prompt and
vigorous action to avert or minimize
the damage is necessary. Such action
should include measures to slow the
growth of population to zero as rapidly
as possible.
It will also be necessary to develop
programmes to alleviate political ten¬
sions, render nuclear war impossible,
divert flows of resources and energy
from wasteful uses in rich countries
to uses in poor ones, increase the
human benefits resulting from each
pound of material and gallon of fuel,
devise new energy sources, and, ulti¬
mately, stabilize civilization's annual
throughput of materials and energy.
Ecological disaster will be difficult
enough to avoid even if population
limitation succeeds. If population
growth proceeds unabated, averting
disaster will be impossible.

The hour
of
decision
by Boris Urlanis
The U.S.S.R/s leading
demographer
declares that the
reduction of birth-rates
is now an urgent task
for certain countries
26
BORIS URLANIS is probably the most
famous name in Soviet demography. A mem¬
ber of the International Council on Population
Studies and the World Society for Population,
he is Vice-Chairman of the Scientific Council
on Social and Economic Problems of Popu¬
lation, of the Economic Department of the
USSR Academy of Sciences. His many
books published in Russian include "Popu¬
lation Growth In Europe" (1941), "Population
Dynamics and Structure in the USSR and
USA" (1964) and 'Dynamics of Soviet Popu¬
lation" ((1974). "Wars and Population" a
historical analysis, has been published in
English (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1971).
HE United Nations decision
to designate 1974 as International
Population Year testifies to the critical
nature of the world's population
problems. As with the problems of
eliminating the nuclear threat, stopping
the arms race and safeguarding the
environment, the future of mankind
depends on their solution.
In speaking of population growth,
we should note at the outset the
complete polarity of the tasks needing
resolution. Two starting points are .
possible; the need to raise the birth¬
rate, the so-called pronatalist position,
and the need to reduce the birth-rate,
the so-called antinatalist position.
Social and economic and physical
and geographic conditions differ
sharply, and this determines the
differences in the tasks facing the
countries of the world. In some
countries, the birth-rate has fallen to a
low level, in certain areas even to an
excessively low level; in others the
birth-rate is at a high level, even
excessively high. The governments of
these countries should not look upon
the situation passively; influence must
be brought to bear on it, actively and
effectively. This means pursuing a
definite demographic policy.
In the Soviet Union and the European
socialist countries such a policy is
expressed in measures for stimulating
the birth-rate. Some people are scep¬
tical of such measures, believing that
they cannot have any noticeable effect
on demographic processes. The past
few years, however, have definitely
proved the groundlessness of such
scepticism. In Czechoslovakia, for
example, the birth-rate was 14.9 (births
per 1,000 persons) in 1968, 15.5 in 1969,
15.9 in 1970, 16.5 in 1971, 17.8 in 1972,
and 19.2 for the first nine months
of 1973.
Thus, in the past five years, the birth¬
rate in Czechoslovakia increased
nearly one third. This was the direct
result of important government efforts
aimed at helping women and making
it easier for them to combine mother¬
hood with social labour. Czechoslo¬
vakia has now surpassed all the
European socialist countries (except
Albania) in terms of birth-rate.
Appropriate efforts are also being
made in the Soviet Union. Apart from
general legislative measures and the
broadening of the network of pre¬
school institutions, factors which
should ensure a rising birth-rate are
improvements in the standard of living,
housing and public services. These
factors have apparently begun to
operate. In 1970 and 1971, there were
170 births per 1,000 women between
the ages of 20 and 24, and in 1971 and
1972, the figure rose to nearly 174.
The figures for women between the
ages of 25-29 were, respectively, a
little over 132 and 137.
None the less, this by no means
disposes of the need for a more
vigorous demographic policy aimed at
making it easier for working women
to bring up children. Many regions of
the Soviet Union at present experience
a shortage of manpower resources,
and with the future in mind society
must be concerned with making up this
deficit. Developing the vast expanses
of the U.S.S.R. and its massive natural
resources will benefit not only the
Soviet Union but all mankind.
The question is fundamentally dif¬
ferent in the developing countries and
even in the economically advanced
Western countries. The high birth-rate
in many countries has become a
serious obstacle to economic growth.
In some countries the economic growth
rate in fact cannot keep up with the
population growth rate. ' Their econ¬
omies are like a lorry trying to climb
a slippery incline: the wheels spin
around, but the lorry stays in one place
and sometimes even slides backward.
It would be wrong, of course, to
conclude that a high birth-rate is the
main or only reason for the difficult

food situation in many countries. It
cannot be denied that rapid population
growth in these countries hampers the
solution of economic problems and
slows down development. But the
birth-rate is the result of the social and
economic conditions in which the
people live: illiteracy among hundreds
of millions of people, a low cultural
level, the absence of social insurance,
backward forms of economic develop¬
ment, the feeble use of women's labour
in social production.
Meanwhile, under circumstances of
changing social and economic con¬
ditions, with the elimination of feudal
vestiges and neo-colonialism, these
countries, having gained freedom and
independence, have effected the eman¬
cipation of women and a growth in
their culture. In drawing women into
social labour they must take advantage
of the opportunities that modern
science offers for achieving wanted
motherhood and family planning, that
is, for practising so-called birth control.
Over a half century ago, the eminent
American writer, Upton Sinclair, said in
The Book of Life: "Birth control is a
great achievement of the human intel¬
lect, equalling the discovery of fire
and the invention of the printing press.
Birth control means freeing women and
all mankind from the blind and irrational
fertility of nature, which created us as
animals and would gladly have left us
in such a state had we not rebelled
against it."
The great Indian philosopher and
educator, Rabindranath Tagore, stated
it more categorically when he said:
"The birth control movement is a great
movement."
In the deep past, peoples who
needed to limit their numbers did so
barbarically by infanticide. That dark
period of history is long past. By the
Middle Ages, most countries no longer
used artificial means for controlling
population size. Then, at the close of
the Middle Ages, the European aris¬
tocracy began practising birth control
within the family. This practice steadily
became more and more widespread,
until it extended to the majority of
married couples.
The first to embark on this road were
Finland and France, whose populations
by the end of the 19th century made
up approximately three per cent of the
world population. If it can be assumed
that perhaps one-third of the married
couples in these countries were limiting
the number of their children, it may be
concluded that at that time birth
control was practised by no more than
one per cent of the married couples
of the world.
At the beginning of the 20th century,
a large proportion of the population of.
Western Europe and the western
regions of Russia was regulating the
number of children in the family. We
estimate that at that time about eight
per cent of the world's married couples
limited themselves to wanted children.
The tumultuous 20th century, the
century of world wars and social
revolutions, has sharply changed the
position of women. An ever growing
proportion of them is being drawn into
social labour, and this "new" function
of women is beginning to compete
more and more with their maternal
functions. The patriarchal family is
giving way to a new type based on
small families and the participation of
women in production. By the middle
of the 20th century, about one-fourth
of all married couples were inten¬
tionally limiting the number of children
in their families.
During the third quarter of our
century, this process will become more
intensified. Many countries, large and
small, now fall within its sphere of
influence. Birth control is practised
almost universally in Japan and is
becoming increasingly widespread in
India and some other Asian countries.
The available information indicates
that measures to reduce the birth-rate ^
have also embraced part of the r

population of the Chinese People's
Republic. It may be considered that
today about 45 per cent of the world's
married couples limit the number of
their children. It is not impossible that
this figure will continue to grow so
that by the end of this or sometime
in the next century it will reach a full
100 per cent.
However, even 100 per cent family
planning would not mean that the
problem was solved. It is extremely
important to know how many children
married couples are likely to have
before they begin limiting the number
of births. If they began, say, after the
birth of the fifth child, the effect would
be insignificant. Therefore, along
with birth control, the governments of
a number of countries also encourage
the concept of small families. Thus
in India young women are advised "not
to rush with the second child and to
think twice before having the third".
With cultural growth, the increase
in the share of women's labour, the
reduction of infant mortality, the
expansion of social insurance and the
disappearance of vestiges of the past,
the attitudes of married couples will be
oriented to small families.
If half the married couples limit
themselves in the future to two children
and the other half to three, the number
of births would in time approximately
equal the number of deaths, and the
world's population would in due course
become stabilized. Only then can it
be expected that the urgency of the
population problem will disappear.
This stability will not drop from
heaven. It must be achieved and
organized. Many people imagine that
Marxists have always and everywhere
stood and continue to stand for
maximum population growth. In fact,
this is not the attitude of scientific
socialism, but of Utopian socialism.
The English scholar and Utopian
socialist, William Godwin, for example,
wrote in his Enquiry Concerning Social
Justice (1793) that "The population
could grow for a myriad of centuries
and the earth would not fail to provide
it with food."
Fredrick Engels stated the question
another way. After reading Karl
Kautsky's book on population prob¬
lems, he wrote the author a letter in
which he said: "The abstract possi¬
bility of such a numerical growth of
humanity as would raise the necessity
of placing limits on this growth nat¬
urally exists." Engels' letter was dated
1 February, 1881. Over 90 years have
passed, and with the enormous changes
that have taken place this is a long
enough period for the "abstract possi¬
bility" which Engels foresaw to become
a concrete necessity.
To bring about the necessary limits
foreseen by Engels, changes in the
social and economic conditions under
which peoples live are essential and
along with these changes a corres¬
ponding demographic policy. Borrow¬
ing the idea of a traffic light, we
could say that in today's demographic
situation a red light means "panic", a
green light, "no problems", and a
yellow, "be prepared for a stop".
Sowing panic only means compli¬
cating the situation. A green light is
also inappropriate since there are no
grounds for unconcern. The only wise
position is to make a sober evaluation
of the situation and take the necessary
steps in time. To change the colour
metaphor, we might say that in¬
temperate, unconcerned optimists look
at these problems through rose-
coloured glasses, and over-concerned
pessimists, through dark glasses.
However, we feel that the glasses
should be removed altogether in order
to see life as it is. In other words, we
should be realists.
The "Green Revolution" in India,
Mexico and other countries has made
it possible within a short period to
increase grain harvests, and this has
somewhat mitigated the food problems.
It is essential to take full advantage
of this respite and to work for a
reduction in the population growth rate
in countries where it is excessive.
Besides using the short variety of
wheat that gives less stalk and more
grain, there are many other ways to
increase harvests. While the average
yield in the U.S.S.R. was 1,020 kilo¬
grammes per hectare between 1961
and 1965, and 1,370 kg. between 1966
and 1970, it rose to 1,760 kg. in 1973,
or 26 per cent higher than in the
preceding Five Year Plan period.
Fertilizers, mechanization and land
improvement are all means of increas¬
ing agricultural output, but one must
not conclude that there is no food
problem in the world. According to
the Food and Agriculture Organization,
nearly one billion people are starv¬
ing or are seriously undernourished.
However, an increase in agricultural
output in many countries requires
material resources and a social system
which they do not have. Under these
conditions, their population problems

are especially acute, and along with
them is the problem of birth control.
The neutrality of the United Nations
in this matter reflects respect for all
beliefs and views, but in the long
run it can bring peoples only harm.
The role of the United Nations and
its specialized agencies, including
Unesco, in solving population prob¬
lems can be distinctly traced at inter¬
national demographic congresses. At
the first (Rome 1954), only timid steps
were taken towards expanding res¬
earch and gathering statistics and esti¬
mates of the future world population.
The second congress, held 11 years
later (Belgrade, 1965), provided a
broad forum at which population ques¬
tions were subjected to all-round and
penetrating discussion, since they had
by then assumed the dimensions of
problems demanding solution.
Various opinions were expressed,
different positions were brought to
light, various ideas were suggested.
Nearly nine years have gone by
since then. The time for talking has
passed; it is now time for action. It
is clear that in a number of countries
the reduction of birth-rates must be¬
come a task of national urgency. The
accomplishment of this task, however,
should not encroach on the sove¬
reignty of governments and families.
Firm recommendations are needed on
how to carry out a demographic policy
which would have a decisive effect on
the reproductive habits of married
couples in the respective countries.
This, in turn, requires considerable
funds and clear legislation.
State finances are handled by
governments, and government insti¬
tutions pass the laws. Therefore, the
U.N. was wise to convene a third
congress at government level, for
August, 1974, in Bucharest, the capital
of Romania. This congress, it is hoped,
will mark a new stage by studying
population problems in terms of
concrete measures for their solution.
An active demographic policy invol¬
ves not only control over the birth¬
rate or, conversely, its stimulation,
but also measures for reducing the
death-rate.' There has been unques¬
tionable progress in the fight against
infant mortality in nearly all countries.'
But the situation with adult mortality
has in some respects worsened: at
least two million people die each year
from accidents alone.
Perhaps at the Bucharest Congress
it would be useful to raise the ques¬
tion of establishing an international
accident prevention centre to fight
against all forms of accidents: street,
home and industrial. It should also
be remembered that in many countries
there is a growing proportion of old
people who see poorly and hear poorly
and are therefore more accident-prone.
I am reminded of a parable. Once
upon a time an Eastern ruler sum¬
moned his wise men and ordered them
to write the history of mankind. Being
unequal to the task, they decided to
answer him in brief: "People were
born, suffered and died". The Inter¬
national Population Year should add a
sizeable contribution to the great
common fund of achievements in the
natural and social sciences, so that
a brief history of mankind would go
like this: "People were born, did not
suffer and lived a long and happy life."

A new global model
analyses four options
for tomorrow in the face
of looming disaster
A
COMPUTER
WARNING
OF HUNGER
TOMORROW
by Mihajlo Mesarovic,
Eduard Peste/
and Maurice Guernier
30
The authors of this article, members of the
Club of Rome, collaborated in a new global
computer study on the interrelationship of
population, food resources, energy and eco¬
nomic growth, to be published next October.
Here they present its conclusions with regard
to food and population.
MIHAJLO D. MESAROVIC, of the U.S.A.. Is
professor of engineering and mathematics
and director of the Systems Research Center
at Case Western Reserve University, Cleve¬
land.
EDUARD PESTEL, of the Fed. Rep. of Ger¬
many, is professor of engineering and director
of the Institute of Mechanics at the Technical
University of Hanover.
MAURICE GUERNIER, French economist
specializing in problems of tropical agronomy,
has led several African development planning
missions, in Cameroon, Dahomey, Chad,
Rwanda and Burundi.
II N recent years, a consider¬
able number of studies have appeared
on global problems. These studies
have analysed the demographic char¬
acteristics of the world and their pro¬
jected pattern to the year 2000,
agriculture, food supplies, energy
resources-, etc. Each of them is
extremely important in its field.
However, these problems are closely
connected. The future of agriculture
for example can be discussed only in
terms of future needs and therefore
of demographic growth. Demographic
growth is in turn directly related to
food and other factors.
To forecast world population 30 or
50 years ahead is therefore feasible
only if account is taken of all the
factors in the equation, particularly
agriculture, food, fertilizers and energy,
both in a given region and in others
where the picture may be different.
This phenomenon the interaction,
the inseparable fusion of all these
problems might be termed the "world
problem complex". In other words, all
these analytical studies are valid only
if they are linked together in a global
network the world problem complex.
And yet it is equally essential to recog¬
nize the world's diversity. One can¬
not speak of the world's food problem,
but only of North America's food prob¬
lem, Western Europe's food problem,
the Soviet Union's, South Asia's, etc.,
and each is profoundly different.
There may be famine in one region,
abundance in another. We must
therefore agree that the world is at
the same time one world and many.
To understand it properly, it must be
studied in its unity and in its diversity.
The future obviously is uncertain.
]]>

<page number="31">
<![CDATA[
But we can anticipate its characteris¬
tic features if at first we learn to
understand the unity and the diversity.
We should then be able to forecast
probable trends, so that finally be¬
cause we understand the causes we
may be in a position to choose bet¬
ween a number of possibilities.
The new world study, which we have
completed at the request of the Club
of Rome, had exactly this purpose of
understanding our planet better, of
discerning future trends more surely,
so that it might be possible to influence
the future, by heading off catastro¬
phes, by averting large-scale injus¬
tice, and by promoting a better quality
of life...
The study required two years of
work with a large team of specialists,
and culminated in the construction of
what we call the Mesarovic-Pestel
Model (1). All the data are recorded
in three computers situated at Cleve¬
land (Ohio), Hanover (Fed. Rep. of
Germany) and Grenoble (France),
which can be questioned by telephone
or satellite from any part of the world.
True to the concept of the world's
diversity, all the data registered relate
to ten large regions North America,
Western Europe, Japan, Australia-
South Africa, U.S.S.R. and Eastern
Europe, Latin America, the Maghreb
(North Africa) and Near East, tropical
Africa, South Asia, China. There are
therefore ten autonomous economic
models, which allow one region or a
group of regions to be studied, but
there is also in effect a single world
model, since the ten sections are inter-

Germany.
linked. This model is thus a reflection
of the world's unity and diversity.
A second major characteristic is
that the Model is a "multi-level"
one, comprising data on natural resour¬
ces (oil deposits, mineral reserves),
technological data (industry), econ¬
omic data and so on. All these data
are interlinked, since they react one
with the other.
A third characteristic is that the
Model constitutes, not a means of
predicting the future manifestly an
absurdity but a tool for understand¬
ing what is likely to happen if on the
first hypothesis events are allowed
to unfold without hindrance, or if on
the alternative hypothesis various
different kinds of action are taken.
The different possible policies fed into
the computer are called "scenarios".
Each scenario elicits a reply derived
from all the basic data of the Model.
A final important characteristic of
the Model is that obviously it does
not record all the countless world
data, but only the principal basic rela¬
tionships. To put it in simplified terms,
what the Model brings into play
essentially are the demographic char¬
acteristics, the food requirements,
energy, economic growth-r-in short,
the major construction materials of
the future, the materials with which,
if he holds them in his hands, man
can build a better world.
Here are some of the principal con¬
clusions of the Mesarovic-Pestel
Model, in particular with regard to
population and food.
The most crucial questions in this
respect are: Is the precarious state
of the world food supply situation a
temporary aberration, resulting from
inadequate attention given to the prob¬
lem and which therefore can be
remedied quite readily? Or is it a
persistent or even worsening problem
whose solution would require major
efforts ? If the latter is true, the next
and most urgent question is: What
are the characteristics of the different
strategies which can be used to avert
a catastrophe?
Analysis of the first question pro¬
duced the conclusion that the historical
pattern of development will make the
situation increasingly worse until it
reaches truly catastrophic proportions.
In considering the second question
we analysed a number of scenarios
and were able to identify some basic
components which any strategy aimed
at the solution of the world food situa¬
tion must have.
Our world model has certain features
of special relevance to the food-popu¬
lation problem. The model contains
a detailed representation of diet and
food types, region by region, and is
based on 26 different varieties of food.
The model also incorporates the effect
that is produced by lack of essential
diet elements, such as protein, on the
population.
The regionalization of the model is
most important here since, although^

MOUNTING PRESSURE
ON THE LAND
The four graphs on these pages were
produced by a computer on the basis
of data provided by a new world
computer model elaborated by
M.D. Mesarovic and E. Pestel.
According to these studies, certain
catastrophic events await the world
before the year 2025.
The graph, right, shows how the density
of the population, expressed in numbers
of persons per square kilometre of
cultivated land, is exercising pressure
on the food production potential of
5 major regions of the world. The study
states that the worst hit will be
South Asia, where every square
kilometre of cultivated land now
supports 370 human beings. In the
year 2000 it will have to feed 700 persons,
and 1,370 by 2025. In Western
Europe, by contrast, each square
kilometre will have to feed less than
500 persons by the year 2025.

The thick black line on graph, right,
shows in billions how the population
of the Third World would grow if the
present average growth rate were
to continue. It would reach the figure
of 12 billion around the year 2030.
The curve labelled 1975 indicates
that the Third World's population
would level off around the year
2060 at a figure of 6.27 billion if
population controls were Introduced
now. The other two curves show
that if population controls were
Introduced in 1985 and 1995, the

level off at 7.97 billion (around 2070),
and 10.17 billion (around 2085).

kwe are talking of the "world" food
problem, the location of actual food
supplies and the location of actual
food deficits are clearly crucial fac¬
tors. For example, the potential for
increasing the production of prime
beef in Latin America is of minor
importance for the relief of food short¬
ages in South Asia, especially if it
is potential in the sense of assuming
use of land yet to be developed.
The comprehensiveness of our
approach, as exemplified by the num¬
ber of data levels included in the
Model, is also important. Too often
the question of food supply is con¬
sidered solely within the confines of
economics. It might be stated for
example that all we need is a three per
cent annual increase in agricultural
output and this is represented in
monetary terms. Yet one does not
eat dollars but grain; the real ques¬
tion is how much food can be pro¬
duced in physical terms. Hence a
mere accountant's approach is not
sufficient here.
Nor can the world food supply
problem be solved by a laboratory-
type approach, since the problem is
not what a wizard could do if he
could transform all arable land in the
world into a greenhouse, but rather
what can be produced with the land
of the type and area we have avail¬
able, using the economic and human
resources which exist at a given time.
Assessing the development of world
food supply on the basis of laboratory
or experimental results leads to rather
naïve, if not downright irresponsible,
conclusions. One is dealing, after all,
with human lives, which should not be
considered so lightheartedly.
Another important feature of our
model is its capacity to consider in
realistic terms the relationship between
the implementation of a population
policy and its effects on population
change. Our population sub-model

SOUTH ASIA'S
FOOD GAP
On the graph, left, the black line
represents the population increase in
South Asia, assuming that a population
policy is initiated that leads to
equilibrium fertility in about 50 years,
so that population grows from 1.3 billion
in 1975 to 3.8 billion in 2025. It is
also assumed that there will be no
starvation to slow down population
growth. In this situation the annual
protein needs of South Asia (top curve)
would increasingly surpass its own
annual protein production (bottom curve),
thereby resulting in a protein deficit
of an estimated 50 million tons in
the year 2025. (This protein deficit
is represented by the pink area.)
Even if these 50 million tons of protein
were available elsewhere in the world
for export to South Asia, it would
pose practically Insurmountable transport
and distribution problems.
CHILD MORTALITY AND
FOOD DEFICIENCY
IN SOUTH ASIA
On graph, left, referring to South Asia,
the horizontal black dotted line
depicts the total daily protein ration
considered necessary for each person
70 grammes and the falling black
curve represents the daily regional
per capita protein supply that would
exist if South Asia's population were
to grow to 3.8 billion people In 2025.
If South Asia does not import enough
food in the years ahead, the Mesarovic-
Pestel model foresees half a billion
children in South Asia dying of hunger
by the year 2025 (red area on graph.).
Pink area shows number of children
who are expected to die up to the
year 2025 from other causes, even
if food is available. The above figures
are considered by the authors of the
Mesarovic-Pestel world study as very
rough estimates and should not be
considered as firm forecasts.
YEAR

shows that if current trends prevail
there will be by the end of this century
more people in the "South" than in
the entire world today, and in another
25 years three times as many.
What would happen thereafter is so
astronomical as to be almost ridicu¬
lous to consider. There is no ques¬
tion as to whether such development
will take place or not. The only ques¬
tion is whether the slowdown of popu¬
lation growth will be the result of a
deliberate population policy or the
result of "natural forces" primarily
starvation and malnutrition.
We can feed into our model a range
of population policies aimed at bring¬
ing the population to equilibrium, at
different times-and at different levels,
and implemented with various degrees
of effectiveness.
The need to show the results of
various population policies in a real¬
istic manner is apparent when one
appreciates the delays between the
start of implementation and the effect.
For example, if a fully effective popu¬
lation policy, starting in 1975, achieves
its aim of bringing the fertility rate in
the entire "South" region to an equili¬
brium level in 35 years, the population
equilibrium is not reached until 75
years after the initiation of the policy,
that is 40 years after the objective of
fertility equilibrium has been reached.
Moreover, by the time population
equilibrium has been attained, the
population will be more than twice
as high as when the policy is initiated.
The need to look at least 50 years
ahead, when considering the develop¬
ment of the world system, is thus self-
evident. Unfortunately, few people
are willing to look 50 years ahead.
Finally, the strains on regional re¬
sources can be appreciated from the
fact that on each square kilometre of
cultivated land in the South Asia region
there will be, in the year 2000, 330
additional persons to be fed, and 1,000
33

additional persons in the year 2025.
These figures should be compared
with those for North America, where
there will be an additional 37 persons
per square kilometre of cultivated land
in the year 2000 and 80 more persons
in 2025. To cap all this, the rate of
growth of urban population in South
Asia is twice the growth rate of the
total regional population.
It is not surprising that the most
critical situation regarding food supply
is in South Asia and Tropical Africa.
Here we shall restrict ourselves to
South Asia, since it represents the
biggest problem because of the sheer
numbers involved.
We shall present the results in refer¬
ence to some key scenarios, each
representing a plausible sequence of
events resulting from various political
decisions and social choices.
First scenario
The purpose of the first scenario,
called "Standard", is to obtain an
indication of the persistency of the
food gap during the next 50 years:
in particular, whether the food situa¬
tion is going to be better or worse
and by how much.
The scenario assumes that the his¬
torical pattern of development based
on a somewhat optimistic view of the
past and present situation will continue.
In particular, a population policy is
assumed which will be successful in
bringing the fertility rate to equilibrium
level in about 50 years. It is also
assumed, optimistically, that the aver¬
age use of fertilizer per hectare in the
entire region will surpass the present
North American level towards the end
of the relevant time-period. This will
allow yields to increase by about
1,000 kilogrammes per hectare, again
on average, i.e. taking into account
every piece of land under cultivation.
This in fact is about the increase
which the Green Revolution has
brought on average in the best of all
lands in India and Pakistan. It is
also assumed that all remaining arable
land is quickly brought under cultiva¬
tion and that all the necessary techno¬
logical inputs including irrigation will
be available.
Finally, in order to assess the
magnitude of the food problem, we
assume that no massive starvation
takes place; the difference between
needs and regional production will
then indicate the food deficit which
has to be made up by regional imports
as outright aid if starvation is to be
prevented.
As regards food production, we
focus on a total protein content of the
food produced because it is here that
the worst shortages exist in the
present food supply situation. The
average diet of protein in more than
half of the world is estimated to be
about two-thirds of the daily need, and
in animal protein hardly one fourth.
Furthermore, since food supply in
South Asia relies predominantly on
grain, there is a close relationship
between protein and caloric intake.
If one is at the bottom level, then so
is the other.
The results of our analysis show
quite clearly that the gravity of the
food crisis in South Asia will far from
lessen but rather will increase to un¬
bearable proportions. The protein
deficit will increase up to more than
50 million tons annually; and this in
spite of all the assumed advances
including permanent cultivation of all
possible arable land. The cost of
importing such food would be stagger¬
ing. It would amount to one third of
the total economic output of the region
and perhaps three times as much as
could be paid for by exports.
Much more revealing than the mon¬
etary figures are the physical quan¬
tities involved. If the food deficiency
has to be covered chiefly by grains,
the annual import will have to reach
in 2025 about 500 million tons of grain,
which is a larger amount than the
total annual grain production, as opti¬
mistically projected from the historical
trends for the year 1980, in all the
north regions combined. In sheer
bulk, this would be double the ton-,
nage of all goods being shipped from
the United States overseas at present.
The average haul from the North
American Mid-West to either coast is
between 1,000 and 2,000 miles, so
about 750 billion ton-miles would be
required, if one had to carry the grain
by rail from the harvest place to the
ships in port. This ton-mileage is
nearly equal to the total annual rail-
freight mileage in the United States
of today. These quantities would
have to be moved to South Asia every
year, not only in the year 2025, and
increasingly beyond, without end, if
some other development does not
take place. In the case of India alone,
an enormous fleet of trucks would be
needed to distribute the grain to
500,000 villages.
Second scenario
Clearly, such a development is not
sustainable. But what would happen
if the needed food imports were not
provided? This is analysed in the
second scenario, in which all other
assumptions have remained the same,
except the assumption that the food
imports will be covered by someone
from somewhere. This assumption is
removed. The result is diet deficiency
and mass starvation.
The catastrophe would start some
time in the early 1980s and would
reach its peak around the year 2000,
when the deaths related to food defi¬
cit would more than double; after that
peak the natural consequences would
start bringing the population down.
The number of food deaths related
to child-birth would aggregate to about
500 million children, from 1980 up to
the year 2025 ; and the sufferings, of
course, would continue for many de¬
cades beyond. In such catastrophic

EXODUS TO
THE CITY
The problem
begins
where?
by Ashish Bose
HE crisis of human settle¬
ment is no less acute than the crisis
of population explosion and the need
for controlling human settlement is at
least as great as that for controlling
population growth rates. And yet in
the massive literature on population,
the attention given to the settlement
pattern is utterly inadequate.
Demographers have usually relied
on geographers to study the subject.
Of late, however, because of rapid
urbanization, increasing rural-urban
migration and the consequent ecolog¬
ical problems, demographers have
been forced to devote more attention
to urban growth, internal migration
and population redistribution.
But the perception of the problem
of settlement Is still heavily biased by
an almost exclusive concern for the
metropolitan areas and big cities. It
is still rare to find demographers
studying the settlement pattern from
the rural angle in spite of the obvious
fact that the great majority of the
countries are predominantly rural and
most of them will continue to be so
even at the end of this century.
ASHISH BOSE, of India, is professor at the
Demographic Research Centre, Institute of
Economic Growth, in Delhi, and Secretary-
General of the Indian Association for the
Study of Population. A specialist on ques¬
tions of urban growth, he is the author of
"Studies in India's Urbanization (1901-1971)",
published in 1972, and editor of several demo¬
graphic studies of which the latest is "Popu¬
lation in India's Development, 1947-2000".
The growing concern for environ¬
ment has introduced a new dimension
to demographic studies, and for that
matter, to all studies. It cannot be
denied that some of the environmental
problems are most acute in the big
cities, but the obsession with pollution
problems in big cities tends to under¬
estimate the urgency of environmental
problems like floods, deforestation,
soil erosion, primitive sanitary condi¬
tions, and a host of allied problems in
rural areas. This gives rise to the
tendency of most people to equate
environmental problems with pollution
problems of big cities. And yet the
majority of the world population lives
in rural areas afflicted by serious
environmental problems.
One of the pioneering studies on
environment Only One Earth by Bar¬
bara Ward and René Dubos begins
the chapter on "Problems of human
settlements" as follows: "The first
need is to take the strain off existing
cities", and proceeds to give some
figures indicating the deplorable hous¬
ing condition in Indian cities. But one
could argue with equal force that "the
first need is to take the strain off rural
areas the strain of poverty, unem¬
ployment and economic and social
stagnation." One could also give
figures for the deplorable state of the
productive base of the rural economy
in countries like India.
An overemphasis on the problems
of big cities created by "the human
avalanche" of migration, to use the pic¬
turesque phrase of Ward and Dubos,
underestimates the positive role of
migration in relieving rural poverty.
There is inadequate realization of the
role of cities as reception centres for
the rural poor in countries like India.
The tendency to look upon rural-urban
migration as a nuisance and urbaniza¬
tion as an evil and to dream of pure
air and the picturesque landscape in
the countryside is to shut one's eyes
to economic reality.
This is not to deny the urgency of
positive measures to regulate rural-
urban migration. But the popular view
that as rural to urban migration is
creating serious problems, such migra¬
tion should be curbed, is an over-sim¬
plification. One should ask: Serious
problems for whom? Certainly not for
the rural migrant in spite of all the
hostilities of the urban environment.
In fact, rural poverty and unemploy¬
ment drive the migrant to the city.
Can one look upon the cities as the
exclusive preserve of only those who
are already there and ask for an
internal passport system in the name
of orderly urban development? As a
recent study of poverty in India points
out: "Urban poverty is an outflow of
rural poverty. Hence action against
poverty has to be initiated in the rural
areas."
It is important to realize that the
success of urbanization policies in
developing countries depends to a ^

W considerable extent on the success of
modernization of agriculture and trans¬
formation of rural areas. Under condi¬
tions of rapid population growth and
agricultural stagnation, the flow of
migration from rural to urban areas
cannot be stemmed merely by restric¬
tive policies. The best deterrent to
migration in such a situation is accele¬
rated rural development.
Gunnar Myrdal has discussed the
problem of agricultural development
at length in his Asian Drama. Analyz¬
ing the main difficulties involved in
formulating policies in South Asia, he
refers to the urgency of making greater
use of a labour force today largely
underutilized and rapidly increasing in
size if a much higher volume of
aggregate output is to be achieved.
A common feature of developing
countries in Asia is the excessive
dependence on agriculture, and one of
the primary objectives of development
planning is to reduce this dependence
and to evolve a more diversified
occupational structure. However, both
on account of excessive population
growth and the colonial background
and related factors, there has been a
structural stagnation in these countries.
The population problem cannot be
viewed merely in terms of an accelerat¬
ing growth rate on account of a per¬
sistently high birth-rate and a rapidly
declining death-rate. The population
problem in the developing countries
of Asia is much more a problem of
structural stagnation on account of a
persistently high proportion of the
working force having to depend on
traditional agriculture.

Considered from this viewpoint,
improvement in agricultural technology
and the modernization of agriculture
will have a bearing not only on agricul¬
tural productivity but will also release
forces of modernization which will
affect the attitude towards family size.
It is curious that in the massive dis¬
cussions on the population problem
in recent years so little has been said
about the relevance of land reforms.
Once we look upon the population
problem as a problem of structural
stagnation, any measure which can
break this stagnation should be con¬
sidered as a development measure.
Further, if such a measure encour¬
ages occupational mobility, it is direct¬
ly relevant to family planning in terms
of a higher motivation to practise
family planning.
To the extent that land reforms
succeed in giving land to landless
agricultural workers, they generate
occupational mobility and can there¬
fore be considered as both a develop¬
mental measure and a fertility influenc¬
ing measure.
In any case, in countries where a
predominant majority of the population
depends on agriculture and the major
share of the national income is derived
from agriculture, it is natural that any
demographic policy which seeks to
influence fertility behaviour must take
note of this basic economic reality.
Unless the social and economic life of
the rural masses is touched by our
policy measures, economic and social
stagnation cannot be broken.

False prophets
of doom
by
Maaza Bekele
An Ethiopian educator
challenges the idea
that Africa needs
population control
42
MAAZA BEKELE is head of the Social Ser¬
vices Department in Ethiopia's Planning
Commission Office, and has taught at the
Haile Selassie University in Addis Ababa.
Her article Is an edited and abridged version
of a study she presented last May at an
African seminar on population and economic
development, held in Dar es Sa/am (Tanzania),
under the auspices of the World University
Service. The study has also been published
by "Ceres", FAO Review on Development,
Rome.
O write about the "popu¬
lation problem" in Africa is to fall into
the convenient trap of admitting that
there is a problem caused by the
existence in Africa of a certain num¬
ber of people with certain demographic
characteristics. To write about Africa
in global terms is also to deny the
fact that this particular region of the
Third World is not a homogeneous
unit, but is a mosaic of peoples,
cultures and differing conditions.
Perhaps the only common denominator
is the economic underdevelopment of
the different countries of *he region,
contrasted with the great potential of
a great people.
In many centres of learning in the
Western world, sophisticated men and
machines are engaged in the "num¬
bers game". They work out elegant
models to prove that the world is
threatened with disaster, attributable
largely to the "population explosion"
occurring in developing regions such
as Africa. A continuous stream of
articles points to the dangers inherent
in "decreasing mortality rates" and
"unchecked fertility".
But it is encouraging to note that
some scholars question the value of
this "numbers game". John Maddox,
in his book "The Doomsday Syn¬
drome", lodges a "complaint" against
the prophets of doom and their hys¬
terical pronouncements. David Evers-
ley, himself engaged in demographic
research, has the humility to admit that
nearly all the "theories" put forward so
far by demographers can be exploded.
None can encompass the complexity
of human behaviour and the reproduc¬
tion of the species.
In fact, not much is known today
about African population trends. Such
demographic data as are available are
recapitulated below. What is of con¬
cern is that the recurring explosive
statements made about Africa's pop¬
ulation may only serve to distract
attention, both within and without
Africa, from the real problem that
millions of people living in a rich envi¬
ronment today have a less than ade¬
quate opportunity to develop their
true potential.
The demographic data base in Africa
is exceedingly tenuous, consequently
it is difficult to state with any degree
of certainty the exact size of the
population. Today, the situation is not
much better than that described by
Jonathan Swift in the 18th century:
"...Geographers, in Afric maps,
With savage pictures fill their gaps,
And, o'er unhabitable downs
Place elephants for want of towns."
In two publications put out by the
same organization, at about the same
time, the estimated total African
population is stated in one to be
363 million in 1970, and in the other
338 million in 1971. A 2.8 per cent
growth rate per annum, assumed in
another publication, gives us the total
of 329 million in 1970 a difference of
34 million for the same year. Crude
projections to the year 2000 on a
2.8 per cent growth rate, yield a diffe¬
rence of 76 million souls, (which was
close to the estimated size of the
entire Eastern African sub-region in
1970). One need hardly stress how dan¬
gerous it could be to play the "numbers
game" with this quality of data.
If we assume that the size of the
population lies somewhere between
these estimates, say, 350 million in
1970, this represents between 9 and
10 per cent of the total world popu¬
lation occupying just over 20 per cent
of the earth's land surface. If by the
year 2000 the African population
should increase to about 818 million,
it would represent 12.6 per cent of the
world's total. It is interesting to note,
however, that in 1650 the population
in Africa constituted 20 per cent of
the total.
The decimation perpetrated during
the slave trade in the 17th and 18th
centuries, military engagements which
attempted to ward off impending
colonization in the 19th century, the
subsequent exploitation of African
labour, the introduction of new dis¬
eases from Europe and the spread of
locally endemic diseases through the
migration set in motion at that time,
all contributed to an absolute decline
in the number of African people over
a period of 200 years. Thus, the per¬
centage relative to the rest of the
world was quite dramatically lowered.

It is only since the beginning of this
century that the rebuilding of the Afri¬
can population has begun.
Today, Africa is constituted of
41 independent states and a number
of colonial territories. There is also
South Africa with almost 23 million
people, one fifth of whom are a white
racist minority.
In 1970, of the 41 independent states,
only 9 had a population over 10 million;
13 had less than 2 million and the
remaining 19 had a median population
of about 4 million. Only Egypt, Ethio¬
pia, Nigeria and Zaire can be consid¬
ered large countries with populations
in excess of 20 million.
Population densities as compared to
the rest of the world are low, averag¬
ing 11 persons per square kilometre
in 1968 as against the world average
of 26. A more useful measure in Afri¬
can agricultural societies is, however,
density per square kilometre of arable
impending disaster which will be caus¬
ed by decline in mortality, due to
improved health care.
The argument goes something like
this: a decline in mortality means an
increase in the number of infants, with
a consequent rise in the dependency
burden. Many more adults will reach
a ripe old age, thereby creating a
demand for more jobs and services.
Pressure on the land will increase
rapidly and there will not be enough
arable land left to produce sufficient
food. At the same time, the number
of women in the reproductive age
group will increase, with a potential
impact on fertility.
This "high level of fertility", as the
World Bank's Sector Working Paper
on Population Planning puts it, "...can
be expected to decline everywhere.
However, cultural and social factors
are significant enough to make for
important differences in fertility levels

land. This was estimated to be 184
in 1968, a much lower average than
the world figure of 248.
But perhaps the most challenging
characteristic of the African population,
as in the rest of the developing world,
is the predominance of young people.
Close to 44 per cent of Africa's popu¬
lation is under 15 years while less
than 3 per cent is 65 and over.
The prophets of doom contend that
both the structure and the consequent
potential size of the African population
(as one component of Third World
potential), is a threat to general world
prosperity and a deterrent to econo¬
mic development in the African coun¬
tries. They see an absolute decline
in fertility as the only remedy to the

among areas of the world. In the face
of continuing success in reducing mor¬
tality, no developing country has yet
experienced a fertility decline suffi¬
cient to reduce the rate of population
growth to the average level of 1 per
cent per annum characteristic of the
developed economies of Europe, North
America and Japan. Falling fertility is
the only factor that can accomplish
such a reduction except, of course, a
return to much higher mortality rates."
This one-dimensional approach in¬
variably leads to pressure on African
governments to adopt population con¬
trol programmes as the panacea for
their and the world's ills. It has also
resulted in extremely simplistic state¬
ments and propaganda handouts which
are often not politically sensitive,
hinting in some cases at the threat to
white children, which a growing
coloured population represents.
But what in fact does the future hold
for these white children? A 100 per
cent chance to finish secondary
school; more than 50 per cent chance
of a university education and if they
live in San Francisco, London, Stock¬
holm, or Moscow, they will consume
a much larger proportion of the
planet's resources than any child born
in Addis Ababa, Accra, Lagos or
Algiers, and several thousand-fold that
of children born in the vast rural areas
south of the Sahara.
In Africa we cannot afford to look
upon our growing population as a
problem. We have to face up to the
challenge of engaging our young,
expectant peoples in the struggle to
achieve the most rapid development
possible, while ensuring an equitable
distribution of the fruits of develop¬
ment. And Africa must accomplish this
in the face of tremendous pressures
and the general lack of concern in the
developed world for promoting global
development.
The focal point of the challenge lies
in the speed with which African nations
can introduce fundamental changes in
the structures they have largely inheri¬
ted and ensure (1) efficient allocation
of available financial resources, (2)
adequate and timely investment in the
intellectual and physical potential of
the majority of the African people, and
(3) maximum participation by the Afri¬
can people in planning and executing
development programmes within an
economic and social system that
appeals to the idealism and imagina¬
tion of a young population.
Many African countries have fallen
victim to the economic concepts of the
1950s which assume a dualism be¬
tween growth and equity and have
given priority to rapid growth. But
Africa is composed of traditional, rural-
agrarian societies not easily incorpor¬
ated in simplistic growth models.
Pressures, mainly from without, have
led to the allocation of scarce re¬
sources to a largely artificial, modem
industrial sector. This has caused
increasing underemployment in rural
areas, accompanied by rural-urban
migration and a reduction in food
supplies.
The modern sector, on the other
hand, is not creating jobs fast enough
to absorb displaced labour. Hence
an increase in overt unemployment in ._
many African cities, particularly among ñ 4
school leavers whose western-biased
education has led them to expect jobs *
which the system just cannot provide, r

It is open to question whether the
growing employment problem in Africa
is primarily a product of population
growth, or can be attributed to the
allocation of resources away from
rural agricultural development, the
greatest overall potential in Africa.
Africa's economic development has
and continues to be dictated largely by
the world economic structure. Trade
relations are distorted and the pro¬
duction process in most African
countries is not geared to meeting
African needs but must of necessity
be oriented to the export sector from
which much-needed foreign exchange
is obtained. Many African countries
have become overdependent on one
crop coffee in East and West Africa,
cocoa in Ghana, groundnuts in Sene¬
gal, and so on.
Despite the efforts of the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Develop¬
ment, the developed world has not
yet responded to the challenge of
changing its structure of production
so as to absorb the products of
developing countries. In Africa there¬
fore we can only continue to press for
the required changes in trade relations
between rich and poor countries. But
the new move in Africa is much more
important a move toward economic
co-operation between and among
African nations, which together can
provide a market large enough to
admit of viable trade.
Within African states also is the
further move toward fundamental
restructuring of economic and social
development, based on Africa's agri¬
cultural potential. Physical and social
infrastructure, including marketing
arrangements, must be built up; insti¬
tutional reforms, particularly land
reform and settlement, must be carried
out; technology suited to the African
reality smallholder agriculture must
be developed, and policies pursued
which will ensure that the private cost
of capital does not cheapen the price
of labour, available in abundance all
over Africa.
Timely intervention and investment
in critical areas such as the Sahel
belt will forestall disaster in drought-
threatened areas south of the Sahara.
Thus investment in agriculture will not
only build up Africa's economic base
and absorb its labour force, it will
also provide the food required by
Africa's growing population.
Given its existing structure and the
"bulge" that could accompany even a
small improvement in nutrition and
general living standards, a doubling
of the population in many African
countries by the turn of the century
may be inevitable. This is the eventu¬
ality Ethiopia for instance faces. The
first priority must therefore be to meet
the needs of this increasing population.
Children and adults must be educated
and services provided. The capacity
to cope with life today and in the 21st
century must be built up in the citizens
of Africa.
Both financial resources and trained
manpower are in short supply in most
African countries. This is why many
governments are searching for new
and more imaginative approaches
which will permit them to offer the
largest majority of children and illiter¬
ate adults the opportunity to acquire
basic education and the skills required
to promote development in rural
agrarian economies. The bold experi¬
ment in Tanzania is a case in point.
Ethiopia's recent Education Sector
Review also indicates that it is possible
within available resources to achieve
this goal in 10-15 years.
The physical capacity of the African
people must also be built up through
improvement in the general levels of
health and a better standard and
quality of life. Today, average life
expectancy in Africa is only 40 years.
Infant mortality rates are astronomical
over 150 per 1,000 live births in
14 out of 25 countries. There is an
exceedingly high death-rate among
children under 5 years. The advocates
of population control argue that family
planning will result in lower infant
mortality and child deaths. Almost
unlimited funds are made available for
family planning programmes, but they
are often withheld where no official
programme exists.
It seems almost sinister that there
is so much money available to control
life and hardly any to promote it.
It also seems unrealistic to expect
that poverty-stricken, hard-working
African mothers many close to death
before the age of 35 can be expected
to limit the number of their children
when only 1 out of 3 or 4 survive.
The onus is on the "controllers" to
demonstrate to these women that 3 out
of 4 of their children will survive.

They cannot run the risk that their
major creative contribution to humanity
(given that the rest of their existence
is almost pure drudgery), will be
denied them. In each woman is the
grain of hope that life for her offspring
will be better than hers.
Besides, in African society, pro¬
creation and the loving, tender rearing
of children is one of society's most
important goals. Children are not a
burden, they are an asset in the
average farm family.
It is little wonder therefore that
family planning programmes have so
far had little success in Africa. Only
8 African countries Botswana, Egypt,
Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco,
Nigeria and Tunisia have officially
instituted family planning programmes.
By and large these are mainly concen¬
trated in the urban areas where fertility
levels are already lower than in rural
areas, and only a minuscule portion of
all women in these countries is being
reached. Little attention is paid to
evaluating either the impact or the
cost of these programmes.
One attempt at evaluation is Lars
Bondestam's report on "Population
Growth Control in Kenya". This study
indicates that it is mainly women who
" The prophets of doom contend that both the
structure and potential size ofAfrica's
population is a threat to worldprosperity
and a deterrent to economic development in Africa.
This is a one-dimensional approach. In Africa
we cannot afford to look upon our growing
population as a problem. We have to face up
to the challenge of engaging our youth in the
struggle to achieve the most rapid development
possible. Africa must accomplish this in the
face of tremendous pressures. "
have a comparatively high standard of
living who are involved in the family
planning programme. Only the edu¬
cated among them tend to start con¬
traception early in their child-bearing
period. Only about half of the
acceptors remain in the programme
after one year, and a sizeable pro¬
portion of these are women who have
few or no children. Bondestam also
contends that the cost of the pro¬
gramme, now in its fifth year, is
exceedingly high compared to other
countries. There were some 8,000
births prevented in 1969/1970 at a
unit cost of about U.S. $155.
The view is widely held in Africa
that until a greater proportion of
children are able to stay alive, large
numbers will continue to be born. An
increase in the survival rate will, how¬
ever, depend on two factors the rate
at which the level of health of the
majority of the African people can be
improved, and a steady and per¬
ceptible rise in the standard and
quality of their lives.
The road to economic development
in the 1970s is being charted. This
development can make it possible to
offer to the majority of African vil¬
lagers and the urban poor a simple
package of health promoting services
a package which costs very much
less than elaborate hospital services
available in the African metropolis.
Perhaps the greatest challenge that
Africa faces is that of mobilizing the
hearts and minds of the mass of Afri¬
can people in the development effort,
releasing their latent energies so that
they themselves will take the challenge
of developing their land to its full
potential. This means more involve¬
ment of local communities and the
African youth in the decision-making
process and in the implementation of
programmes which benefit the majority
by providing productive employment.
Traditional organizations in Africa
must be adapted to meet this need.
African women must be given a real
stake in producing and reaping the
fruits of development. It may even
be so that in cities like Lagos and
Accra, Cairo, Nairobi and Addis
Ababa, the emerging role of women in
today's social and economic activities
has begun to affect both productivity
and fertility trends.
The only evidence we have in human
history of "population stabilization",
or reduced population growth, is the
experience of the now developed
countries that decline in fertility is a
function of prosperity. There is no
reason to expect underdeveloped
Africa to follow a different path.

UNITED
NATIONS
WORLD
SURVEY
fciARLY this year the United
Nations published a report on a second
world inquiry into population and dev¬
elopment. Carried out by the U.N.
Economic and Social Council with the
governments of 80 countries, the
inquiry covered many aspects of the
population question.
In its May 1974 issue, the "Unesco
Courier" presented the findings of the
survey with respect to government
attitudes and policies towards popu¬
lation. In this issue we publish its
conclusions with respect to the provi¬
sion of family planning facilities.
"Family planning activities organized,
sponsored or permitted by govern¬
ments are spreading throughout the
world", the U.N. report says, "even
in those countries where no explicit
population policy has been adopted
or where pronatalist objectives are
being pursued." In many countries
such services are made available in
the interests of mothers' and children's
health, sometimes on a state basis,
sometimes through clinics operated by
voluntary bodies.
The U.N. report describes the
countries covered by the survey as
falling into four distinct categories
where family planning is concerned:
1. Countries where governments
organize or actively sponsor broad
national family planning programmes,
including countries where such activi¬
ties are foreseen for the near future;
2. Countries where the population
is practising birth control with the
assistance of private, non-govern¬
mental bodies;
3. Countries where family planning
is not officially endorsed or assisted,
or where it is even forbidden;
4. Countries where no information
is available on family planning.
The U.N. report summarizes its find¬
ings on family planning in the major
regions of the world as follows:
Africa
Egypt, Kenya and Tunisia have well
advanced national family planning pro¬
grammes and are making further
efforts to improve these activities. The
Government of Swaziland stated that
family planning advice will increasingly
become an integral part of the basic
health services. Madagascar is con¬
sidering undertaking a pilot study in
family planning. The U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa reports that
Tanzania officially accepts family
planning services offered by a private
association but has no official national
programme of its own.
Gabon is totally against any form of
family planning measures because of
its low fertility and is the only country
in Africa where the sale of contracep¬
tives is an offence. In Malawi family
planning has not, so far, been offi¬
cially endorsed as a national policy.
Zambia too ^ has no specific official
policy of family planning.
Information available to the Eco¬
nomic Commission for Africa shows
that to date eight countries with about
24.5 per cent of Africa's population
have official family planning program¬
mes while 13 other countries with
48 per cent of the region's total popu¬
lation, though having no official pro¬
grammes, have programmes run by
voluntary associations, some of which
receive government support. There
are, on the other hand, some 21 count¬
ries with 27 per cent of Africa's total
population which are at present either
not interested in or are opposed to
family planning programmes and,
therefore, have no programmes at all.
Latin America
Countries of Latin America are also
in a somewhat early stage of develop¬
ing family planning activities. Barba¬
dos, Colombia, Panama and Trinidad
and Tobago have national family
planning programmes. In Mexico,
family planning is understood as a
social and medical service to which
the whole population is entitled, es¬
pecially those of lower income. (Fur¬
ther details on population questions in
Latin America are given in a special
article published on page 62.)
Asia
In the Asian continent, family
planning programmes are widespread.
Twelve countries, among them the
most populous, have national pro¬
grammes. China, India, Iran, Japan,
Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the
Republic of Viet-Nam, Singapore, Sri
Lanka, Thailand and Turkey have
accumulated valuable experience, and
achieved significant results in influenc¬
ing fertility through family planning.
In Israel and to a less extent in the
Khmer Republic, family planning ser¬
vices are provided by medical insti¬
tutions but are not endorsed as an
official government policy. They are
not intended to reduce the birth-rate
but serve the purposes of general
welfare and responsible parenthood.
In several other Asian countries, Bah¬
rain, Jordan, Laos, and in the near
future possibly also the Syrian Arab
Republic, family planning is the work of
the health and welfare administration.
In Iraq, the government is not
expected to take measures in the near
future to reduce the birth-rate.

k Europe
The European continent is in a dif¬
ferent demographic situation from most
other regions. Family planning ser¬
vices are promoted in many European
countries and it is known that the
population at large is availing itself
of the existing contraceptive methods,
medical advice and often also liber¬
alized abortion laws.
Countries most closely concerned
with family planning are the United
Kingdom, Denmark, Netherlands, Yu¬
goslavia and some eastern European
socialist countries. In Romania family
planning is approved by the govern¬
ment for reasons of family health and
welfare with rather pronatalist general
tendencies. Hungary is sympathetic to
family planning services mainly as a
means of avoiding induced abortions.
In most western European countries
private family planning services exist
within the general health and social
welfare programmes, along with a
widespread use of different contracep¬
tive means and methods, and birth
control is regarded as a strictly private
matter. This is clearly the case in
Sweden but can also be inferred in
Austria, France, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Finland and Norway.
The position of the Ukrainian S.S.R.
and the Soviet Union is less clear.
Family planning is officially not en¬
dorsed although contraceptive means
and relevant medical and social ser¬
vices are widely available. Greece,
Spain and Italy have no official or
officially recognized private family
planning services.
48 North America
In Canada the government's role is
to encourage the development of
family planning services and provide
advice and assistance. The Canadian
family planning programme was ini¬
tiated in 1970.
The Federal Government and Con¬
gress of the United States support
family planning programmes on the
premise that the spacing and limitation
of births strengthen the health of the
mother, increase the integrity of the
family and provide greater opportu¬
nities for the children.
Oceania
In Fiji a Government family planning
programme has been operative for
several years. New Zealand did not
have an official national family
planning programme until 1971 when
the Government decided to introduce
one and to extend the activities it had
hitherto been supporting in this field.
In Australia, there are no official
family planning activities and advertis¬
ing of contraceptives is prohibited, but
family planning services are expected
to attract more government support in
the years to come.
In conclusion, the U.N. Report makes
two general observations:
The most advanced family planning
activities organized by government
agencies are in Asia and North Africa.
On the other hand Europe and North
America are the continents where
family planning appears to be most
widely practised by the population
even though these measures do not
usually form part of government policy.
The situation in the countries sur¬
veyed clearly indicates a tendency
toward the spreading and improvement
of family planning activities and their
development as an integral part of
health and welfare programmes.

NEW TEACHER
NEEDED
EVERY MINUTE
Between 1970 and 1985, the develop¬
ing regions will need more than 7 ¡ mil¬
lion new primary school teachers. It is
estimated that 273 million children will
be attending primary school in these
regions in 1985 over 100 million more
than in 1970. This means that more
than half a million new teachers must
be found every year; more than 1,300
every day; 57 every hour; or one new
teacher every minute. These figures
are based on the assumption that the
developing regions will increase their
enrolment during this period at the
same annual rate as during the last
decade, and are taken from a new
Unesco study. "Educational Develop¬
ment, World and Regional Statistical
Trends and Projections until 1985,"
prepared by the Office of Statistics for
the World Population Conference in

In the developing world
This illustration tells a tragic story about the children of the
developing world. It contrasts the shortage of primary
schools at three points in time: 1970 (left), 1960 (centre),
and 1985 (right). In 1960, 118 million children aged 6-11
years were deprived of schooling; if they had linked hands
they would have circled the globe three times. A decade
later, the situation had only slightly improved : 113 million
children in the same age group were without schools. How¬
ever, if educational trends during the last decade continue,
by 1985 population growth will be such that 165 million chil¬
dren in the developing regions more than one child in three
in the primary school age group will not be enrolled in
school. If they were to join hands these children would be
able to circle the globe four times. 51

HAN SUYIN Is the noted novelist who for
17 years has paid yearly visits to the People's
Republic of China. She is the author of a
dozen works on China and Asia including
"China In the Year 2001" (1967). "Asia today"
(1969) and numerous novels. An ardent femi¬
nist and medical doctor, she has observed
family planning In China (where she was
bom) since 1956. In this article, originally
published in "Unicef News' (No. 78). she
sums up her 17-year research and reports
the latest facts based on her visit to China
In the summer of 1973.
EDUCATION is the key."
"All policies must be understood
by the masses, carried out by the
masses, and be in their interest."
In these two sentences, we find the
clue to understanding family planning
in China. For it is through a pro¬
gramme of public education that peo¬
ple are being influenced to practise
birth control voluntarily as part of
community life. The special lesson
that the Chinese experiment offers is
that family planning must not be
something dictated by fears, economic
pressure, or coercion; but that it must
be thought of as being essential to
the personal development of both
woman and man.
The first family planning drive oc¬
curred in 1956 in the cities and af¬
fected only about 15 to 20 per cent
of the population. In the parks, peo¬
ple queued up for contraceptive dis¬
tribution; pharmacies exhibited con¬
traceptives openly; films on the birth
process and family planning tech-:
niques were shown. This was already
a break with past prudery and the
taboos of tradition.
In rural areas, agricultural co-opera¬
tives began in 1956, followed by
communes in 1958. For the first time,
women worked in the fields, as indi¬
viduals, not as part of a male-gov¬
erned family. They were paid wages
according to work done, and were
voting in the co-operatives on com¬
munal projects. Great infra-structural
works (road building, dams, reservoirs,
canals) to transform the land caused
labour shortages in the rural areas
and millions of women came out to
work and thereby to acquire status
as independent individuals.
At the same time the Woman's Fed¬
eration also sponsored family planning
education in rural areas. The Federa¬
tion had been instituted in 1950 to
achieve countrywide education of
women, to promote emancipation and
equality, and the new marriage based
on individual choices.
But there was a great deal of tradi¬
tional superstition and ignorance to
overcome. In the peasant families I
interviewed, husbands were against
family planning. One of them, previous
to liberation in 1949, had had eight
children who had all died of disease
and starvation. Now he had remarried
and wanted another eight. "We have
so much more to eat, why should we
not have more children?"
For the first time, as a result of an

stories recount the exploits of
revolutionary heroes.
increase in crops, there was no star¬
vation in China's countryside, and the
peasants wanted more children as
"labour power" to care for them in
old age. Also, mothers-in-law, afways
despotic over their sons' brides,
wanted grandchildren quickly and es¬
pecially grandsons. And finally, ig¬
norance made many people fear
contraceptives. "The man becomes
impotent"... "the woman's skin be¬
comes yellow..."
On the other hand, the younger
women, aware of the crippling effect
of numerous and repeated childbirths
would ask, "Why should we stay at
home and just have baby after baby?"
In those days, however, the conser¬
vative element was far more prominent.
As a result, in the countryside, family
planning had an adverse "shock"
effect upon the peasantry. They really
felt it was wrong even to discuss the
matter. The women were too shy to
talk about it.
In 1959 and 1960 I was in many
industrial cities interviewing women
workers in factories, and it was there,
for the first time, that I felt the thrill
of woman's emancipation. During the
Great Leap Forward of 1958, when
a stupendous effort was being made
to step up industrialization, 80 mil¬
lion women who had never worked
before came out to participate in this
enormous movement.
I interviewed a woman of 37, with
four children, whose husband was a
worker. She herself had stayed at
home "to look after the family" until
in 1958, against her husband's wish¬
es, she mobilized four other house¬
wives, her friends, and all five of
them started a small "street factory",
making pots and pans for the daily
use of people. Within two years,
their small factory was producing
thermostatic equipment for a large in¬
dustrial complex in the city.
In the years to follow, I found hun¬
dreds of such examples, including
grandmothers starting "neighbour¬
hood" workshops and street factories.
Today, there is not a city in China,
not a street, without its small work¬
shops where self-employed house¬
wives are turning out daily goods,
including many necessary items and, in
some cases, complicated equipment
and spare parts for larger factories.
A young woman worker I spoke
with in 1966, now a member of the
Central Committee, told me that every
prospective couple in her factory was
instructed in family planning. She and
her fiancé had already decided on the
number of children they would have.
Among industrial workers, in China's
expanding industrial sector, family
planning is being implanted as a nor¬
mal accompaniment to marriage.
Everywhere in the cities, the un-
der-thirties mentioned family planning
as an essential part of their lives
and of their emancipation. "Of
course we want children, but not to
be tied down to nappies and the kit¬
chen all the time ... a woman is as
good as a man in work ... we must
also contribute to the transformation
of society ... it is good for our
health ... I saw my mother and father
quarrel all the time because of too
many babies . . ."
Regulations for mother and child
care have also helped to establish the
value of a woman's function as mother.
A woman is entitled to 56 days of
resting time away from work before
giving birth, for which she receives
full pay. In each factory there are
nurseries, and mothers are given
breast-feeding time for which they are
also paid. I visited textile mills where
one can see women leaving their
spinning machines and being replaced
automatically by spare workers, while
they walk to the nursery nearby to
feed their baby. During an 8-hour
work day, each woman may leave the
bench three times to feed her baby
for a period of about a half hour.
Nurseries are placed next to each
workshop so that women are only
two or three minutes walk away from
their infants.
To relieve working mothers in the
cities, there are street nurseries.
Every morning and afternoon, one can
see quaint little bicycle carriages with
8 or 10 toddlers being taken to the
nurseries, by older men, who are called
"grandfathers".
However, about 50 per cent of the
toddlers are still being cared for at
home by grandmothers, for in China
the family still largely consists of
"three generations living together".
Grandmothers thus become an im¬
portant social force, which has its _ft
good and bad features. On the one Hj
hand, it makes for a united family;
on the other, the chief dissent to fam-
ily planning comes from older women, r

L who often insist, especially in rural
areas, on getting their sons married at
an early age and on having ."grand¬
sons" as soon as possible.
But there are exceptions. In 1966,
I saw a grandmother in a commune
who had called on the doctor to have
her son's wife fitted with a contracep¬
tive, and who went around spreading
family planning education.
Today, after the Cultural Revolution,
family planning has been solidly
organized as a nationwide movement,
under a family planning council direct¬
ed by the Ministry of Health. Branches
are established at every level, right
down to the smallest village. Both
men and women participate in this all-
out mass drive. The work is unpaid
and voluntary, with the chief emphasis
on direct contact: house-to-house
visits, street meetings of housewives,
direct talking and persuading.
Over the last two years this direct
approach has been used most exten¬
sively. In Peking and other cities,
each street has its family planners.
They hold meetings in which every
family is involved and these meetings
go on for weeks. Families also .have
many discussions among themselves.
In one street, Kuang An Men, which
has about 47,000 people, a collective
decision was reached to produce no
more than 360 babies in that street
during the year 1973.
This "common decision by consen¬
sus of all the potential childbearers
(about 13 per cent of the women) in
the street" was arrived at after each
case was debated. Families with
more than two or three children were
asked to wait, priority for childbearing
being given to those couples who
wanted a first or second child. "We
shall bring our population increase
down to 7.5 per thousand, or 0.75 per
cent, this year", the street committee
woman, a young worker of 30, with one
child, said to me.
In 1972, the women employees of
childbearing age in one administrative
operation decided not to have more
than two children each. (Two children
[is the ideal, but three children are
quite common.) "Of course it is some¬
times difficult when the two are both
girls. Many women still like to have
a boy and will try a third time for a
boy." This example has now been
emulated by many other organizations
throughout China. "A girl child is as
good as a boy child" is a sentence
now heard everywhere.
In another organization (a teaching
institute) a priority system for child-
bearing was agreed on among the
staff. A couple without children was
due to have one; but a woman with
two girl babies was pregnant again;
and she insisted that this one was
going to be a boy.
"What could be done? She was
not only having a third child, but she
was actually taking someone else's
turn." The matter was solved, how¬
ever, with another woman voluntarily
giving up her turn to have a baby, and
having an abortion instead. This pub¬
lic-spirited self-sacrifice may appear
strange to other societies, but in China
one must remember these decisions
are individual, not enforced, and they
serve as "examples" to be emulated.
There are countless anecdotes and
stories, illustrating the immense debate
going on today. There is the young
couple with two children who both got
a raise in salary, and immediately said,
"Now we can have another baby" an
example of the love of children which
characterizes the Chinese.
On the other hand there is the
example of the two young workers
who delayed marriage by another two
years (they had already been engaged
for two years), to "set an example"
in late marriage, perhaps the most
effective method of population control.
There is the story of the commune
where 175 young couples voluntarily
delayed their marriages by one year,
and the story of a woman who has nine
children, all of them girls, and will
continue until she achieves a boy.
There is the commune in Szechuan
province, a backward area, where the
peasants have carved: "Birth control
is a patriotic duty" on a hillside, and
the 30-year-old peasant I met in Kuei-
chow province who had seven children
and refused to give permission for his
wife to be sterilized.
Such contradictory stories are facets
of a great human transformation; family
planning becomes a moving drama of
consciousness, of the emancipation of
the woman as a total human being, of
the struggle against tradition and
ignorance. It is part of the liberation
of man too "Only when woman is
liberated will man also be liberated."
In the industrialized areas, in fac¬
tories, and in the cities, the family
planning drive has already achieved a
good measure of success. In the
Peking area, for instance, 70 per cent "
of the city workers (clerical staff,
workers in factories, etc.) are practis¬
ing family planning. In Shanghai, an
even greater effect is reflected in the

population increase rate, which has
fallen to 0.6 per cent from a high in
1963 of about 2.5 per cent. In Peking
the population increase last year was
1.17 per cent, whereas it was 3.5 per
cent in 1963.
But the countryside is also showing
progress. Thus, in the county of
Hsingtou, in Szechuan (pop. 500,000),
12,000 vasectomies were performed
last year.
I visited communes in Chekiang
province in 1971, and found each
brigade clinic abundantly provided with
contraceptives, including the oral pill.
But this was not enough. At that
time, the "barefoot doctors" were
responsible for carrying out family
planning both in spreading propa¬
ganda and in providing contraceptives.
They are the young people between
17 and 21 years old who serve
3-5 years in the countryside as para¬
medical workers, and whose existence
are 1,300,000 of themhas
assured the most complete network
of preventive inoculation measures and
health care anywhere.
It has now been found out that they
are not the ideal medium for this task-,
people of this age are still considered
by the peasantry as "too young to
know about such things".
Since 1972, it is through the women
cadres, those in the management
committees at every level in the rural
areas, that the drive for family planning
is most effective. These women are
middle-aged, married, with children,
and practise family planning.
They are "living examples" that
family planning works. Painstakingly,
they will go from family to family,
propagandizing the women, the men.
They work with the medical staff,
with the barefoot doctors and health
workers. They are trusted and
accepted by the village women. They
bring contraceptives to each house, so
there is no excuse of "being too busy"
to go to the clinic.
I visited one commune where every
morning, the woman secretary stands
in the fields and shouts to the working
women: "Have you taken your pill?"
She checks personally on each and
everyone of them. Only in this way
can the oral contraceptive become
effective. "Most women forget to take
it ... or take it for a little while only . . .
But each case is an individual case;
we cannot force anything or anyone.
So we give them a wide choice."
Since all contraceptives and all
operations are free of charge, it is up
to the individual to make up his or her
mind. Hence, the wide range of con¬
traceptives, and also abortion on
demand. "But abortion is not the
answer. We want less and less abor¬
tions, more prevention."
How can family planning, without
coercion, without economic pressures,
but only by education and persuasion,
be achieved?
It implies, above all, a total refusal
to adopt "emergency" attitudes of
crisis, to adopt shortcuts and auto¬
cratic methods of pressure. Consider¬
ation for the human factors, for
emotion and tradition, coupled with a
continuing process of education for all
is what distinguishes the Chinese
experiment.

FAMILY

the Ghanaian
experiment
by Robert Plant
HE Ghana National Family
Planning Programme was launched in
May .1970, following growing concern
over trends revealed by the 1960
census. Successive governments
have supported the project. Its stated
purpose is to make information and
services available to every Ghanaian
couple, so that they may have the
number of children they themselves
want.
In announcing the programme, the
government summarized the case for
action in these terms:
"The rapid growth of Ghana's popu¬
lation poses the greatest threat to
our economic development and to the
welfare of our people. Our population
56
ROBERT PLANT, Uganda-born editor and
journalist, is a specialist in social and
economic problems of developing countries.
He was senior economics lecturer at the
International Labour College, Kampala (Ugan¬
da), and Is author of 'Population and Labour",
a study of the consequences of rapid popu¬
lation growth for workers in developing
countries (ILO, 1973).
increases by 5,000 every week and
this rate of growth far exceeds the
rate of growth of our economy.
"As a nation, we are increasing in
numbers faster than we can build
schools to educate our youth, faster
than we can construct hospitals to
cater for the health needs of our
people and faster than we can develop
our economy to provide jobs for the
new workers who enter our labour
force each year."
Each year in Ghana more than 4,000
mothers die as a result of childbirth
and as many as 40,000 of the children
who are born do not survive to their
first birthday. The government states
frankly that the main reason for these
appalling figures is the high number of
closely spaced pregnancies which are
the lot of many Ghanaian women. The
government's aim is to ensure that
each mother has strong healthy babies
who will flourish.
Ghana's population increases at
about three per cent a year. At this
rate the population will double in little
more than 20 years. If the rate of
population growth could be cut down
to two per cent per annum, it would
take 12 years longer for the population
to double. "This", says the govern¬
ment, "would give us much needed
time to plan and provide for the future."
The promotion of the programme has
called for the greatest circumspection.
In Ghana, as in most African countries,
established cultural practices are pro-
natalist in their appeal. Desired family
size is still high and the motivation for
family planning is generally low.
National problems resulting from popu¬
lation pressures appear remote to the
present generation of Ghanaians.
In his first annual report, the
Executive Director of the National
Family Planning Programme, Dr. A. A.
Armar, pointed out that : "There is
also the fact that, in the face of
growing nationalism after long periods
of colonialist domination, many view
foreign assistance for family planning
activities with suspicion. They declare
that it has the sinister motive of
corrupting the youth, destroying long
cherished cultural practices and
leading to moral depravity."
These constraints notwithstanding,
the programme has made significant
strides in its efforts at making family
planning an acceptable life style. By
the end of June 1972, 140 clinics had
been established. Over 2,000 licensed
chemical retailers were distributing
approved contraceptives of various
types. The total number of acceptors
was just under 46,000 and the number
is steadily growing. New acceptors
are now coming in at a rate of 2,500 to
3,000 a month. This is a good start.
The programme makes full use of
the many resources, both private and
public, that exist in Ghana. Thus the
Ministries of Health, Information, and
Social Welfare, along with private
agencies such as the Planned Parent¬
hood Association and the Christian
Council of Ghana, are playing an
important role . The Trades Union
Congress on its own initiative organ¬
ized a seminar in 1970 to educate mem¬
bers on the need for family planning.
There are still those who say that
the existence of undeveloped land in
Ghana invalidates the argument for the
regulation of population growth. "They
do not realize", says Dr. Armar,
"what an enormous investment of
capital would be required over a long
period before this land could be effec¬
tively developed to support a large
population. Countries like Ghana
simply do not have this capital."
There is still also some concern,
sincerely felt in many quarters, that
family planning will lead to a break¬
down in morality.
On this point, a promotional leaflet,
issued by the Ghana National Family
Planning Programme, had the following
to say:
"The truth of the matter is that lack
of family planning, with its attendant
evils of overpopulation, overcrowding,
unemployment, lack of social services
and inadequate food, leads not only
to a breakdown of moral behaviour
but to many other social ills which
eventually lead to a deterioration of
society. Family planning is indeed a
factor which can help build a strong
and healthy nation."
The government does not claim, and
never has claimed, that family planning
will solve all Ghana's economic
problems. Family planning is only one
of the measures required to ensure
development of the country's economy.
Other measures include agricultural
development, economic planning, the
construction of roads, schools and
hospitals.
The state of the nation's economy,
says Dr. Armar, is reflected in the
degree to which prosperity and health
are enjoyed by individuals. "If our
population continues to increase at the
present rate, improvement in our living
standards will be retarded. That is
why, within the broad framework of
the national development effort, the
Ghana National Family Programme
can be described as one of the most
promising programmes the govern¬
ment has undertaken."
The right balance was perhaps
struck by Ghana's Head of State,
Colonel Ingatius K. Acheampong, when
he said in December 1972:
"It is doubtful whether over-popu¬
lation is the major problem facing
Africa today. Africa is the least popu¬
lated of the continents and taken as
a whole the temptation to argue for
more people may indeed be great.
But we live in a world of planning and
we have a duty to ensure that we
plan as much for the mouths we are
going to feed as for the means by
which we shall feed them."
The nation should aim, he said, at
"the right ratio between the rate of
growth of the economy and the rate
of population growth."

THE GHANA NATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAMME
While certain African countries are opposed to the Idea of
birth control, others have launched national family
planning programmes (see page 47). The Ghana National
Family Planning Programme employs every means
of popular education to spread the family planning message.
The slogan "Family Planning Better Life" is to be seen
everywhere on pencils, calendars, posters, booklets, newspaper
advertisements, car stickers, at the cinema, on the television
screen. The emphasis is always on human happiness. The
smiling couples above are depicted on the back of a book of
strip cartoons entitled "Poverty was my Shadow" which portrays
how one couple advised their friends to break out of the
vicious circle of poverty by limiting their family. Top,
the beginning of a similar story in a play presented by
travelling actors. Husband and wife fight over money while the
terrified children try to separate them. The overburdened mother
already has three children and is expecting a fourth.
In this way, the population debate Is brought down to the grass
roots and the homes of the people.
A mother
from Kenya
explains:
y people
are frightened
of family
planning
by Sarah Lukalo
m AMILY planning is nothing new to Africa and
definitely not to Kenya. For example, my own family
although there were ten of us was very evenly spaced
out, and in Kenya this was almost universally the case.
We were all about three years apart, and in fact it was
considered shameful for women to have children one after
the other. There was a number of taboos to discourage
this; one of them being that if you had any sexual relation¬
ship with your husband when you were breast feeding
your baby, you polluted the milk and you believed that
your child might die.
Perhaps one of the reasons why modern family planning
has become a problem in Kenya concerns methods of
approach. Traditionally, there are certain topics that one
can discuss with older people and others one can discuss
with younger people. But the only people with whom one
can discuss almost anything are people of one's own age.
When modern family planning came to Kenya and I think
to almost all African countries young people were picked
to be family planning educators, to go and talk to people
much older than they, people who probably commanded a
great deal of respect in their own communities. The elders
were insulted at having to listen to young people talk about
such issues.
Another problem is that there was too much discussion
of family planning, as though it were a new thing. The
result was that people tended to think that it was indeed
a new thing.
I know quite a number of individuals who would refer to
family planning field educators as "those girls who kill
babies", and there was a belief that birth control methods
made one sterile. Many felt that if it were the kind of
family planning they already knew, there would have been
some connexion between the traditional way of doing things
and the new ideas. I think that these are two main reasons
underlying the difficulties we face today.
In my view, rather than speaking to people about popu¬
lation growth rates and how much money will be spent to
lower them, a human approach would be more effective.
Every woman is touched by what she can see: her own
family unit. If, for example, her children are continually
falling sick and she goes to the hospital almost every
day, she will be likely to accept the idea of family planning
if it is suggested, say, as a way of helping her. She will
surely realize that in spacing her child-bearing more
rationally, she would be better able to look after her
children. Perhaps her children face malnutrition, or perhaps
she herself is simply overworked and cannot give them
adequate care. In any event, she would be bound to see
the advantages of family planning.
On the other hand, information about the national popu¬
lation growth rate is so remote that although she may
be educated, she will conclude that it is the govern¬
ment's problem and not her own. However, she may feel
that although she cannot do much about national population
planning, she can do something about her own planning
and thereby help improve the well-being of her family.

ordinating Board, in Jakarta.
NE of the major problems
which Indonesia like other develop¬
ing countries has to tackle is the
alarming growth of its population.
With 119 million people in 1971, Indo¬
nesia is today the fifth most populous
nation in the world, exceeded only by
China, India, the Soviet Union and the
United States of America. The 1930
census listed 61 million in Indonesia,
hence within forty years our people
have doubled in number. This tremen¬
dous increase is neutralizing to a large
extent our efforts for planned develop¬
ment and higher living standards.
The huge concentration of people
has caused many social and economic
disturbances as well as hampering
development efforts. In an attempt to
remedy this situation, a national family
planning programme was integrated in
Indonesia's five year development pro¬
gramme in 1970.
Demographers who work in Indo¬
nesia are reluctant to give a single
figure for the current growth rate. The
census in 1971 gave an average annual
increase of 2.08 per cent, while the
first preliminary count in 1970-1971
gave a growth rate of 2.67 per cent.
There is evidence that growth rates in
the regions outside Java are higher
than in Java.
With the development of basic
medical and public health services,
especially after Independence in 1945,
deaths from epidemics like cholera,
malaria and others were controlled
or eliminated altogether. All these
improvements resulted in a decline in
the death-rate, which is now believed
to be 17-19 per 1,000. It is highly
probable that the mortality decline
will continue.- As a result, the popu¬
lation of Indonesia is bound to continue
its upward leap.

In 1973, Unesco organized a literacy study linked with
population and family planning in Indonesia, at the request
of the Indonesian government. Left, a Unesco literacy team makes
a house-to-house survey to check knowledge of family planning
in the village of Cikahuripan. Below, in a subsequent
functional literacy class a housewife reports after group
discussions of the question, and, below left, a farmer works out
his family's food budget Unesco functional literacy teams have
carried out similar missions in Tunisia, El Salvador and
Philippines at the governments' request
Another problem is the age compo¬
sition of the population. Like other
developing countries, Indonesia has a
young population with a heavy concen¬
tration in the ages 0 to 15. The
dependency load in Java and Bali, for
example, is 84 per 100 people. This
causes heavy burdens for provision
of schools and other related needs.
The population aged 10 years and
over for Indonesia as a whole was
80.4 million in 1972. 41 per cent had
no formal education, 33 per cent had
some primary school education and
19 per cent had completed primary
school. In Java and Madura, 93 per
cent had only some primary education
or none at all. The remaining seven
per cent had secondary or higher
education.
There are marked regional variations
in population density. The islands of
Java, Madura and Bali make up less
than seven per cent of the land area,
but they contain two-thirds of the
population. Java had a population
density of 565 persons per square
kilometre in 1971. This makes it one
of the most densely populated large
areas of the world. The density in the
other islands ranged from only 9 in
Kalimantan to 37 in Sulawesi.
Many proposals have been elabor¬
ated for the movement of large num¬
bers of people from Java to the outer
provinces. These efforts began long
before the independence of the country
in 1945. However, the colonial author¬
ities never managed to move as many
as 60,000 people from Java, even dur¬
ing the period of greatest efforts in
the 1930s.
After Independence in 1945 the
government continued the colonial
approach. During the 1950s, a max¬
imum of 40,000 people were moved,
a negligible number when related to
the size of the problem. In 1969, the
year of the largest migration (46,000
people), the population of Java
increased by over a million and a
half I And while the government was
trying to move people from Java to
the outer islands, a spontaneous
migration in the opposite direction was
occurring which might well have
resulted in net migration inwards.
In 1953, a small group began to
promote family planning. Their early
efforts were limited to giving inform¬
ation about the aims and ideas of
family planning and inviting the opin¬
ions of community organizations and
religious leaders. They provided
limited services through Maternal and
Child Health Clinics. These efforts
culminated in the formation of the
Indonesian Planned Parenthood Asso¬
ciation, in 1957.
In 1967, in his speech to the people
on Independence Day, August 16,
President Suharto stressed the need
to adopt family planning programmes,
and in 1969 the government formed
a semi-governmental family planning
council, the National Institute for
Family Planning. It soon became clear,
however, that more government invol¬
vement was needed, and a National
Family Planning Co-ordinating Board
was created on January 22, 1970. This
Board co-ordinates all family planning
activities throughout the country.
The key elements of the programme
are communication and provision of
family planning services. Both are now
taken to the people, involving, where
possible, voluntary organizations and
local leaders. The idea is to motivate
the people to accept the "norm of
a small family" and to facilitate its
adoption by providing advice and ser¬
vices as near as possible to the home.
If family planning is to be accepted
as a way of life by the people, an
understanding of the limiting social-
psychological factors and other bar¬
riers is essential. The relevant factors
include:
universality of marriage,
early age of marriage,
obligation of parenthood,
desire for sons;
and also some social-economic factors
such as:
low level of education,
low standard of living,
the belief that each child has his
own value. ^

k To counterbalance these, there are
also many advantages that the pro¬
grammes have enjoyed, including the
strong support of the government and
the absence of organized religious or
social opposition.
The information and motivation cam¬
paign embraces long-term and short-
term stategies. The short-term stategy
comprises three programmes:
public information, by use of
mass media such as television, radio,
newspapers, magazines, films and
others.
community education, by use of
workshops, seminars, group talks and
community-oriented family planning
campaigns.
face-to-face programmes by use
of specially trained field workers who
visit eligible couples in their homes,
making them aware of the possibilities
of contraception and persuading them
to become acceptors.
The aim in the short term is to
diffuse the idea of family planning and
eliminate barriers. In the long term,
population education will be carried
out both in and out of school, as is the
practice with other programmes aiming
at bringing about a change in attitudes
and behaviour.
Population education is seen as a
process going beyond family limitation
in the narrow sense, to make family
planning a way of life. Beyond family
planning as such is our concern for
the totality of the family... health, edu¬
cation, standard of living, quality of
life, etc. Family limitation, as we see
it, should be an integral part of the
larger fabric of family life.
The relationship between the pro¬
cesses of communication and educa¬
tion is fairly clear. In each case,
information is provided, persuasion is
attempted, and changes in attitudes
and behaviour are reinforced. A re¬
cent paper published by World Educa¬
tion Reports defines the act of edu¬
cating as a sequence of activities that
incorporate the teaching and learning
of separate attitudes, skills, ideas and
facts, a linking together of these ele¬
ments, and obtaining feedback or
reinforcement from one's surroundings
that may or may not cause the person
to incorporate the new attitude or
behaviour into his or her personality
or behaviour.
Given the structure of the popula¬
tion of Indonesia, and the huge percen¬
tage who are not able to go to school,
we believe that population education
is one of the most important means of
implanting family planning ideas. If we
combine literacy programmes and
population education, we have what
might be termed functional population
planning or functional education for
family life planning, as it has been
called.
What has our national family plan¬
ning programme achieved so far?
In general the level of awareness
of the people toward the idea of family
planning has increased tremendously.
When we did a study in 1968-69 we
found that the level of knowledge
about family planning was far below
50 per cent. Today this level has
increased to 80 per cent. A recent
study in Jogjakarta indicated that 82 per
cent of the respondents had heard of
family planning and knew that family
planning was concerned with the
control and spacing of births.
Couples who decide to adopt family
planning have the choice of 2,067
family planning clinics throughout Java
and Bali. They can also go to private
doctors if they wish, and are free to
select any method they desire, free of
charge. Since 1969, 3 million couples
have used these facilities and become
new acceptors. 58 per cent are taking
pills, 35 per cent use an intra-uterine
device (IUD) and the remainder various
other methods.
A recent study in West Java indi¬
cated that the continuation rate of pill
acceptors after two years was 63 to
79 per cent, while the figure for IUD
was 78 to 95 per cent. Other studies
carried out a year before revealed a
similar picture.
Who are the new acceptors? A
10 per cent sample of all new accep¬
tors during the first semester of 1972
indicated that more than 54 per cent
were 30 years of age or below, and
more than 87 per cent had only ele¬
mentary school or lower education.
The number of illiterate new acceptors
was as high as 38 per cent. Peasants
constituted 57 per cent of all the new
acceptors.
Other significant achievements have
been in the field of face-to-face com¬
munication, training of medical, para¬
medical and motivational personnel,
research and evaluation, logistics and
the infrastructure, and a rapid feed¬
back reporting system. All these
generally have developed with the
rapid acceleration of the programmes.
In conclusion, one can say that the
family planning programme in Indo¬
nesia has been favourably accepted
by the people. Though the acceptance
rate is not yet as high as we should
like in relation to the total population,
the acceptors are highly motivated.
We are confident that population
education and functional literacy pro¬
grammes as part of an integrated
approach to family planning will even¬
tually spread the acceptance of the
family planning concept throughout
Indonesia.

For some years now India has organized nation¬
wide family planning campaigns in an effort to
reduce its birth-rate. These campaigns take
various forms. The most effective make use of
traditional media of expression and communi¬
cation, such as dancing, singing, poetry, folk
tales and puppets, since it has been found that
the people accept a new idea like family planning
more readily from familiar folk arts than from
the modern mass media. These photos show
scenes from a puppet play performed in an Indian
village with the simple message: family planning
will help to solve your problems. They are from
a film entitled "Folk Media", made in India by
Unesco as one of a series on the general theme,
"Family Planning Communication". Two other
films in the series have so far appeared. They
portray similar experiments which have been
carried out in Kenya and Iran, and are available

A vast continent
where different
conditions
have produced
different answers
62
other regions of the
world, and perhaps even more than
others, Latin America is a mosaic of
widely varying attitudes, criteria and
standards vis-à-vis the world-wide
phenomenon which is known as the
"population explosion".
Countries in this region have adopt¬
ed very different and even completely
opposed positions in their approach
to this immense problem. There are
countries, such as Argentina, which
are categorically in favour of a policy
of openly encouraging high population
growth, while others, such as El Salva¬
dor and the Dominican Republic, are
pursuing a no less categorical policy
of birth control.
Whatever their positions, however,
there is unanimous agreement among
Latin American governments that the
formulation of population policy is the
sovereign right of each country.
These were the main conclusions
which emerged from the discussions of
the Latin American meeting prepara¬
tory to the forthcoming World Popu¬
lation Conference. This was held in
San José, Costa Rica, last April.
During the meeting it became clear
that the governments of the region
shared a deep preoccupation with the
phenomenon of population growth,
matched by an equally deep appreci¬
ation of the diverse political, social and
economic circumstances obtaining in
this part of the world. These circum¬
stances inevitably determine the
approach to population questions
adopted by each country.
A study prepared by the United
Nations Economic Commission for
Latin America (CEPAL), which was
used as a basis for debate at the Costa
Rica meeting, divides Latin American
countries into five categories according
to their attitudes on matters of popu¬
lation policy. These are as follows:
1 Countries whose governments
have declared themselves in
favour of accelerated popula¬
tion growth. This is the case of Argen¬
tina and Uruguay.
According to the Argentinian repre¬
sentative at the Costa Rica meeting,
"Latin America should defend popu¬
lation growth as a positive factor in
development." Argentina's new popu¬
lation policy has two main objectives:
to increase the population at a more
rapid rate and to ensure a more
balanced distribution of the population
throughout the country.
This means that "the country's
demographic patterns must be chang¬
ed in order to ensure a high growth
rate and thereby occupy our territory
more efficiently, develop our resources
to the full and be able to rely upon an
adequate domestic market", etc.
2 Countries whose governments
consider that the present popu¬
lation statistics and their estim¬
ated future trends are satisfactory
and that in consequence the State
should avoid setting population stan¬
dards and objectives. This is the
position of Brazil and Peru.
The government of the latter country
considers that understanding of the
world population problem would gain
in amplitude and depth if there were to
be an objective analysis of existing
relationships between demographic,
social, economic and political factors.
The Peruvian delegate to the Costa
Rica meeting stressed the vital import¬
ance of "pointing out and rejecting the
fallacy of those who consider that the
problems of Peru (in other words, the
problems characteristic of a developing
country) are caused by high population
growth and that the solution to these
problems lies in curbing it."
The fact is, he declared, there is no
harm in a demographic growth rate of
2.9 per cent "in a country with plenty
of space and an adequate quantity and
variety of natural resources, as is the
case in Peru. The Revolutionary
Government and the Peruvian people
must therefore concentrate their
attention and all their efforts on finding
a radical solution to all those problems
of a structural order which constitute

the real source of difficulty for the
people of Peru."
The Brazilian Delegate, Miguel
A. Ozorio de Almeyda, emphasized the
fact that in a number of Latin American
countries a considerable population
increase is essential for acceleration
of their economic development.
3 The third group consists of
countries whose governments
have stated their intention of
taking action through nation-wide pro¬
grammes designed to have long-term
effects on their birth-rates, but which
have refrained from setting definite
population objectives. This group
includes Colombia, Mexico, Cuba,
Costa Rica, Chile, Guatemala, Nicara¬
gua, Panama and perhaps to some
extent Ecuador.
Mexico is applying a qualitative
rather than a quantitative population
policy, whose essential aim is "to raise
the standard of living of all Mexicans"
and to make every effort "to provide
greater opportunities for all with a
view to bringing about continued
change, and not as a limitation to
protect privileges."
Cuba considers that underdevelop¬
ment problems are not caused by
population growth at all, and its efforts
have therefore been directed not at
controlling demographic processes,
but at bringing about structural change
aimed at stimulating development.
The Cuban representative at the meet¬
ing expressed the view that a rigid
population policy can only be defined
in the context of overall development
policy, which it should reinforce and
complement; the history of world popu¬
lation growth shows that the adoption
of population control is a corollary to
development, not a prerequisite.
Within the same group, Guatemala
also maintains that birth control is not
the universal panacea, the unique for¬
mula for the solution of problems of
population and their consequences.
There is no national family planning
policy in Guatemala, but there exist
family guidance programmes adapted
to the attitudes and motivations speci¬
fic to the Guatemalan people.
4 The fourth group identified by
CEPAL comprises those coun¬
tries whose governments sup¬
port special family planning program¬
mes at local level or on a limited scale.
S The fifth and final group con¬
sists of countries which have
formulated and applied overall
policies designed to reduce popula¬
tion: El Salvador, the Dominican
Republic and Honduras.
El Salvador, a country with high
population density and intense demo¬
graphic growth, advocates the formu¬
lation of an integrated population
policy which its delegate defined as"a
series of actions planned and co¬
ordinated by the public authorities",
aimed at bringing about the greatest
possible individual, family and social
well-being by means of the "rationaliz¬
ation of population dynamics."
Finally, in the Dominican Republic,
another of the decidedly antinatalist
Latin American countries, the govern¬
ment gives its unqualified support to
every type of action aimed at curbing
the birth-rate, and actively promotes
family planning programmes to enable
couples to avoid unwanted pregnancies
and to have children who are wanted
at the time they believe to be right.
It must be pointed out that these
widely divergent attitudes to population
policy are determined by numerous and
extremely varied factors, some of
which are common to the world at
large and others which are confined
to Latin America.
Without attempting to make an
analysis, which would of necessity be
a big and complicated task, one can
list some of these factors. They are:
population growth index (with radical
differences such as that between
Argentina's 1.2 and Costa Rica's 3.8);
density of population (El Salvador has
a "European" population density, while
Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia have vast
areas of virtually uninhabited territory);
the ethnic composition of the popula¬
tion (countries with a very large Indian
or mixed-blood population such as
Mexico, Peru, etc., or with a population
of essentially European origin, such
as those of the "Cono Sur"); wealth or
scarcity of natural resources; psycho¬
logical and cultural factors, the type of
general policy applied in each country.
With so many variables, it is not
surprising that Latin America does not
speak with one voice in the great
population debate.

SUPPOSE
A tale for the
year 3550 A.D.
by Isaac Asimov
64
ISAAC ASIMOV, noted American scientist and science fiction writer, is
the author of over 60 books, ranging from a textbook on biochemistry
(he is associate professor of biochemistry xt Boston University School of
Medicine) to a small book on man-made satellites for eight year olds.
According to the latest edition of Unesco's "Index Translationum", he is the
world's most translated author ofscience fiction (37 translations in 1971).
This article is taken from his forthcoming book for children, "Earth: Our
Crowded Spaceship ", to be published next month under the auspices of
UNICEF, by John Day Co.. New York. The text is copyright f 1974 by
Isaac Asimov. and is reproduced by kind permission of the publisher.
'UPPOSE the whole world
became industrialized and that indus¬
try and science worked very carefully
and very well. How many people
could such a world support? Different
limits have been suggested, but the
highest figure I have seen is 20 billion.
How long will it be before the world
contains so many people?
For the sake of argument, and to
keep things simple, let's suppose the
demographic growth rate will stay as
it is now at two per cent per annum.
At this rate, it will take 35 years for
the population to double, so it will
take the present world population of
3.8 billion 70 years to reach the 15.2
billion mark. Then, fifteen more years
will bring the world population to our
20 billion. In other words, at the
present growth rate our planet will
contain all the people that an indus¬
trialized world may be able to support
by about 2060 A.D. That is not a
pleasant outlook for only 85 years
from now.
Suppose we decide to hope for the
best. Let us suppose that a change
will take place in the next 70 years
and that there will be a new age in
which population can continue rising
to a far higher level than we think it
can now. This means that there will
be a new and higher limit, but before
that is reached, still another change
will take place, and so on. Let's
suppose that this sort of thing can
just keep on going forever.
Is there any way of setting a limit
past which nothing can raise the
human population no matter how many
changes take place?
Suppose we try to invent a real
limit; something so huge that no one
can imagine a population rising past
it. Suppose we imagine that there are
so many men and women and children
in the world, that altogether they weigh
as much as the whole planet does.
Surely you can't expect there can be
more people than that.
Let us suppose that the average
human being weighs 60 kilogrammes.
If that's the case then
1 00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 people
would weigh as much as the whole
Earth does. That number of people is
30,000,000,000,000 times as many
people as there are living now.
It may seem to you that the popu¬
lation can go up a long, long time
before it reaches the point where there
are 30,000,000,000,000 times as many
people in the world as there are today.
Let's think about that, though. Let us
suppose that the population growth-
rate stays at 2.0 per cent so that the
number of people in the world con¬
tinues to double every 35 years. How
long, then, will it take for the world's
population to weigh as much as the
entire planet?
The answer is not quite 1,600 years.
This means that by 3550 A.D., the
human population would weigh as
much as the entire Earth. Nor is
1,600 years a long time. It is consider-
]]>

ably less time than has passed since
the days of Julius Caesar.
Do you suppose that perhaps in the
course of the next 1,600 years, it will
be possible to colonize the Moon and
Mars, and the other planets of the
Solar system? Do you think that we
might get many millions of people into
the other world in the next 1,600 years
and thus lower the population of the
Earth itself?
Even if that were possible, it
wouldn't give us much time. If the
growth-rate stays at 2.0 per cent, then
in a little over 2,200 years say, by
4220 A.D. the human population
would weigh as much as the entire
Solar system, including the Sun.
We couldn't escape to the stars,
either. Even if we could reach them;
even if we could reach all of them;
population would reach a limit. If the
growth-rate stays at 2.0 per cent, then
in 4,700 yearsby about 6700 A.D.
the human population would weigh as
much as the entire Universe.
So you see we can't go on forever
at the rate we are going. The popu¬
lation rise is going to have to stop
somewhere. We just can't keep that
2.0 per cent growth-rate for thousands
of years. We just can't, no matter
what we do.
S try again, and let's be
more reasonable. Suppose we go back
to considering the density of popula¬
tion on Earth.
Right now, the average density of
population on Earth is 25 per km2. If
the population of the world doubles
then the average density of population
also doubles, since the area of the
world's surface stays the same. This
means that at a population growth-rate
of 2.0 per cent per year, the average
density of population in the world will
double every 35 years.
In that case, if the growth-rate stays
where it is, how long will it take for
the average density of population to
become 18,600/km2? Such a density
is almost 750 times as high as the
present density, but it will be reached,
at the present growth-rate, in just
about 340 years.
Of course, this density is reached
only if human beings are confined to
the land surface of the world. Perhaps
human beings will learn to live on the
bottom of the ocean, or on great plat¬
forms floating on the sea. There is
more than twice as much ocean sur¬
face as there is land surface and that
would give more room for people.
That wouldn't do much good, how¬
ever. At the present growth rate, it
would take only 45 additional years
to fill the ocean surface, too. In 385
years, the average density of popu¬
lation would be 18,600/km2 over land
and sea both. That would be by
about 2320 A.D.
But a density of 18,600/km2 is the
average density of population of the
island of Manhattan.
Imagine a world in which the average
density everywhere, over land and sea
alike everywhere in Antarctica and
Greenland, over the oceans and along
the mountains, over the entire face of
the globe was equal to that of Man¬
hattan. There would have to be sky¬
scrapers everywhere. There would be
hardly any open space There would
be no room" for wilderness or for any
plants and animals except those
needed by human beings.
Very few people would imagine a
world like that could be comfortable,
yet at the present growth-rate we will
reach such a world in only 385 years.
But let's not pick Manhattan. Let's
try the Netherlands. It is a pleasant,
comfortable nation, with open land
and gardens and farms. It has a
standard of living that is very high and
yet its average population density is
400/km2. How long would it take for
our population to increase to the point
where the average density of the sur¬
face of the world, sea and land, would
be 400/km2 ?
The answer is 200 years, by about
2175 A.D.
You see, then, that if we don't want
to go past the average population
density of the Netherlands, we can't
keep our present growth-rate going
even for hundreds of years, let alone
thousands.
In fact, we might still be arguing in
an unreasonable way. Can we really
expect to have a world-wide Nether¬
lands in the next 200 years ?
No one really believes that man¬
kind can spread out over the ocean
bottom or the ocean top in the next
200 years. It is much more likely that
man will stay on land. To be sure,
there may be some people who would
be living off shore in special structures,
on the sea or under it. They would
make up only a small fraction of all
mankind. Almost everybody will be
living on land.
Then, too, not every place on land
is desirable. It isn't at all likely that
there will be very many people living
in Antarctica or in Greenland or in the
Sahara Desert or along the Himalaya
Mountain range over the next 200
years. There may be some people
living there, more people than are liv¬
ing there now, but they will represent
only a small fraction of the total
population of the Earth.
In fact, most of the Earth's land sur¬
face isn't very suitable for large popu¬
lations. At the present moment, most
of the Earth's population is squeezed
into that small portion of Earth's land
surface that is not too mountainous,
too dry, too hot, too cold, or too
uncomfortable, generally. In fact, two-
thirds of the world's population is to
be found on a little over 1/13 of the
land surface of the planet. About
2,500,000,000 people are living on
11,000,000 sq. km. of land that can
best support a high population.
The average density on the
11,000,000 square kilometres of the
best land is 230/km2, while the aver¬
age density on the rest of the land
surface is just under 10/km2.
Suppose the population continues
to increase at the present growth-rate
and the distribution remains the same.
In that case, after 30 years, the aver¬
age population density of the less
pleasant parts of the Earth will reach
the 19/km2 figure, but the density of
the 11,000,000 square kilometres of
best land will be 400/km2.
In other words, we will reach a kind
of world-wide Netherlands density-
figure, for as far as we can go, in only
about 30 years.
But will all the world be as well-
organized and as prosperous as the
Netherlands is now? Some of the
reasons why the Netherlands is as
well off as it is now, are that it has
a stable government, a highly-educated
population, and a well-organized
industrial system.
This is not true of all nations and
they need not expect to be as well off
as the Netherlands when they are as
crowded as the Netherlands. Indeed,
if they have an agricultural way of life
and a poorly-educated people, who
don't have long traditions of stable
government, then a population as
dense as that of the Netherlands now
is, would only bring misery.
I N other words, the world
can't keep going at the present growth-
rate, even for tens of years, let alone
for hundreds or thousands.
The matter of a population limit is
not a problem for the future, then.
We might just as well realize that the
world is just about reaching its popu¬
lation limit now.
Of course, this entire argument is
based on the supposition that the
population growth-rate will stay the
same as it is now. If the growth-rate
drops, that obviously will give us more
time before the limit is reached. If it
drops to zero, the limit will never be
reached. Even a 1 per cent per year
population increase, however, is
enough to bring disaster. So we can't
just sit back and do nothing. We will
have to do something.

From
Confucius
to Malthus
Since antiquity men have asked :
'Is there an optimum population?'
66
IAN has been concerned
with population problems since ancient
times. From antiquity, statesmen and
thinkers have held opinions, based on
political, military, social and economic
considerations, about such issues as
the most desirable number of people
or the need to stimulate or retard
population growth.
Ideas and theories on population
have nearly always revolved round the
real or supposed problems of individual
societies and have stimulated the most
response when directed specifically
towards those problems. Thus the
ideas of the philosophers of ancient
Greece dealt mainly with the population
questions faced by the city-state with
a relatively small population. In the
Roman Empire the views on population
reflected the populationist outlook of
a society in which population was
considered a source of power.
The thesis that excessive population
growth may reduce output per worker,
depress levels of living for the masses
and engender strife is of great antiquity.
It appears in the works of Confucius
and his school, as well as in the works
of other ancient Chinese philosophers.-
Some of these writings suggest that
the authors had some concept of
optimum population, as far as the
population engaged in agriculture was
concerned. Postulating an ideal pro¬
portion between land and population,
they held the government primarily
responsible for maintaining such a
proportion by moving people from
over-populated to under-populated
areas, although noting also that govern¬
ment action was reinforced at times by
spontaneous migration.
These ancient Chinese writers also
paid some attention to another aspect
which has occupied an important place
in subsequent literature on population
theory, that is, the checks to population
growth. They observed that mortality
increases when food supply is in
sufficient, that premature marriage
makes for high infant mortality rates,
that war checks population growth and
that costly marriage ceremonies reduce
the marriage rates, although they paid
little attention to the manner in
which numbers adjusted to resources.
Despite these views on population and
resources, the doctrines of Confucius
regarding family, marriage and pro¬
creation were essentially favourable to
population increase.
The writers of early Greece were
more concerned with the formulation
of policies and rules for population
than With theories about it. Plato and
Aristotle discussed the question of the
"optimum" population with respect to
the Greek city-state in their writings
on the ideal conditions for the full
development of man's potential.
They considered the problem of
population size not so much in
economic terms, but more from the
point of view of defence, security and
government. The thought was that
population should be self-sufficient,
and thus possess enough territory to
supply its needs but not be so large
as to render constitutional govern¬
ment impossible.
The more specific observations on
these conditions were made by Plato,
particularly in his Laws. He held that
if the so-called "highest good" was to
be achieved, the city-state should have
5,040 citizens. Since the actual course
of demographic trends might result
in either an excess or a shortage
of population, Plato also proposed
measures to be taken in order to
maintain the desired size. In the case
of under-population, he recommended
rewards, advice or rebuke to the young
in order to increase the birth-rate, and,
in the last resort, immigration. To
remedy over-population he proposed
birth control for large families and, if
necessary, colonization.
Aristotle dealt with population
problems particularly in his Política.
He was less specific than Plato on the
matter of optimum population but
stated that in size and extent the State
should be such as to enable the in¬
habitants to live at once temperately
and liberally in the enjoyment of leisure.
He held that land and property could
not be increased as rapidly as the
population would grow and concluded
that an excessive number of inhabitants
would breed poverty and social ills.
Among the factors which could prevent
an excessive population he mentioned
child exposure and abortion.
The Romans viewed population
questions in the perspective of a great
empire rather than a small city-state.
They were less conscious than the
Greeks of possible limits to population
growth and more alert to its ad¬
vantages for military and related pur¬
poses. Perhaps because of this
difference in outlook, Roman writers
paid less attention to population than
the Greeks. Cicero rejected Plato's
communism in wives and children and
held that the State's population must
be kept up by monogamous marriage.
The preoccupation with population
growth, the disapproval of celibacy and
the view of marriage as primarily and
fundamentally for procreation was
mainly reflected in the Roman legis¬
lation of that time. Particularly the
laws of Augustus, creating privileges
for those married and having children
and discriminating financially against
those not married, aimed at raising the
marriage and birth-rates.
The Hebrew sacred books placed

much emphasis on procreation and
multiplication and, for this reason,
unfruitfulness was regarded as a
serious misfortune. In general, Orien¬
tal philosophers appear to have favour¬
ed fertility and multiplication. An
exponent of some of the views on
population for the period dating back
to some three to four centuries B.C. is
Arthasàstra, a book written as a guide
for rulers and attributed to Kautalya.
The work discusses such aspects as
the desirability of a large population
as a source of military and economic
power (although recognizing that the
population may become too large) ;
the effects of war, famine and pesti¬
lence, and the colonization and settle¬
ment of new areas.
Early and medieval Christian writers
considered questions of population
almost entirely from a moral and ethical
standpoint. Their doctrines were
mainly populationist but less so than
those of Hebrew writers. On the one
hand, they condemned polygamy,
divorce, abortion, infanticide and child
exposure; on the other, they glorified
virginity and continence and frowned
upon second marriage.
The main arguments in favour
of celibate practices are found in
the teachings of St. Paul. Some early
Christian defenders of ecclesiastical
celibacy resorted to economic argu¬
ments not unlike some of those later
used by Malthus. Referring to the
growth of the known world's popu¬
lation, they attributed want and poverty
to this cause and cited pestilence,
famine, war, etc., as nature's means
of reducing excess population.
The prevailing tendency, however,
was to favour, as in earlier times,
population growth. The high mortality
which was found everywhere and the
constant threat of sudden depopulation
through famine, epidemics and wars
predisposed most writers towards the
maintenance of a high birth-rate. The
opposition to birth control, for instance,
was based not only on church doctrine
but also on a fear of depopulation.
The views of Muslim authors on
population resemble those of the
Hebrew and Christian authors. Special
mention should be made, however, of
the interesting but long unrecognized
work by Ibn Khaldoun, an Arab author
of the fourteenth century. His opinions
are noteworthy in two respects.
In the first place, he held that a
densely settled population was con¬
ducive to higher levels of living since
it permitted a greater division of
labour, a better use of resources and
military and political security.
Secondly, he maintained that a
State's periods of prosperity alternate
with periods of decline and that cyclical
variations in the population occur in
rhythm with these economic fluc¬
tuations. Favourable economic con¬
ditions and political order stimulate
population growth by increasing natality
and checking mortality. In the wake
of these periods of economic progress
come luxury, rising taxes and other
changes which in several generations
produce political decline, economic
depression and depopulation.
At the dawn of the modern era, the
emergence of the nation-states and the
related issue of power led mercantilist
writers to emphasize once again the
advantages, both political and econ¬
omic, of a large population. Malthus's
contrary theory had its roots in
political, economic and social issues
which existed during his time. The
same can be said of Marxist views on
population.
More recent developments in popu¬
lation theories have been influenced
predominantly by two factors. The first
of these was the upsurge of population
growth, especially in the developing
countries. This fact has created a
need for a better understanding of the
factors in population growth. Secondly,
the nearly universal preoccupation with
the problems of development has
called for a considerably more pen¬
etrating theoretical framework for
assessing the interrelations between
population and economic and social
development.
The search for an acceptable popu¬
lation theory has thus gained
importance. If such a theory could be
elaborated, it would provide a better
insight into the development process,
and could constitute a basic element
in policy-making and planning for
development.
This text is abridged from the chapter on C |
population theory in "The Determinants and U I
Consequences of Population Trends', a 2-
volume study published by the U.N. Depart¬
ment of Economic and Social Affairs (New
York, December 1973, $24).

A COMPUTER WARNING
OF HUNGER TOMORROW
(Continued from page 34)
circumstances no population policy
could function any more.
Starvation would not be limited to
isolated small areas from which people
could escape, but would extend its
stranglehold over vast regions inhab¬
ited by hundreds of millions. The
population would be trapped and
there would be no fertile areas to go
to as the recent events in semi-arid
Africa have so tragically shown. There
is no historical precedent for this kind
of slow, inexorable destruction of the
population of entire regions which at
their peak were inhabited by several
billion people.
No doubt these events would
eventually lead to an equilibrium
population, and one might see this as
a return to the days before the popu¬
lation explosion took place, i.e. to the
times when birth-rate and death-rate
were nearly in balance. But, surely,
this must not be allowed to happen.
Obviously a solution requires a more
effective population policy.
Third scenario
In the third scenario we have
assumed that the equilibrium fertility
rates are achieved in 25 to 30 years
rather than in 50 years as in the first
scénario. Possibly an optimistic as¬
sumption, but certainly one that should
be achievable. .
Even under these more favourable
conditions the analysis shows that
severe malnutrition cannot be avoided
unless food imports are made avail¬
able, but the required imports are, this
time, on a much smaller scale and the
really large needs appear at a later
date than in previous scenarios,
starting in the 1990s rather than the
1980s.
Also, the amount of food which
would have to be covered by imports
would be reduced to about one fifth
of the needs. The volume of the
imports, in reference to production,
transportation, etc., might then be
manageable, but the economic impact
of food import would still be devastat¬
ing. The problem, however, would be
reduced to economics.
Fourth scenario
In order to see how this cost-eco¬
nomic obstacle to the solution might
be removed, we designed the fourth
scenario in which we assumed that
investment aid is provided to South
Asia in sufficient amounts and at the
required time to close the food gap.
The magnitude of such a programme
would require a concerted action by
all regions of the "North".
The analysis indicated a substan¬
tial increase in the export potential of
South Asia. If the world economic
situation realizes this great potential,
South Asia could pay for the bulk of
the necessary food import. The export
must be industrial, since the agricul¬
tural sector will be occupied with the
demands of the region.
This means that South Asia must
be allowed to develop its own export¬
able and competitive industrial special¬
ization which will not be left to the
mercy of narrow national interests but
rather will rely on long-term world
economic arrangements. This, in turn,
will require the emergence of a new
global economic order in which indus¬
trial specialization corresponds to
regional capacities, the most effective
utilization of labour and capital and of
available world resources, on a long-
term basis.
To summarize, the only feasible
strategy to meet the world food situa¬
tion calls for:
a global approach to the problem;
' productive investment and not only
commodity aid;
balanced economic development
for all regions;
' a world-wide diversification of in¬
dustry leading to a truly global and
balanced economic system;
an effective population policy.
This strategy is also the conclusion
reached by our model for every other
sector of human activity. Omission
of any one of these factors will lead
to certain disaster.
The situation is urgent. The solution
produced by our analysis requires
changes which cannot be achieved
without compromise among the many
parties involved. Even if the will is
there, how much time is left for us to
argue about the many details of
implementation?
The results of our analysis show
that achieving the aims of the popu¬
lation policy in 30 rather than 15 years
would make a difference of 80 per
cent to the number of births. A mere
20 years delay in initiating such a
policy would lead to a 300 per cent
increase. The inescapable conclusion
is that time is indeed short. Delay in
implementing the options to bring
food supply and need in balance could
be fatal.

'All our
estimates
are
inflated...'
... In our forecasts for 1940-60 we
were caught off our guard. We
underestimated, not the magnitude of
population growth but its acceleration.
Some of the experts have now been
caught out by the opposite phenom¬
enon, the deceleration of population
growth. In point of fact, the decline
in birth-rates which we are about to
see on a world scale has already set
in much more steeply in some cases
than was foreseen even on the so-
called low fertility assumption. Such
cases will be a majority in the future...
All our present estimates are inflat¬
ed... They were obtained by extra¬
polation from previous situations which
are now changing and in some cases
reversing... The rate of deceleration
is even more alarming than the pre¬
vious acceleration... Since 1955 the
brakes have been applied sharply in
Eastern Europe, since 1957 in the
United States and since 1962 in West¬
ern Europe. In fact, we are entering
a phase of neither acceleration nor
deceleration but of demographic stop-
go which, one way or another, may
well cost us dear...
Nothing could be unhealthier than
the obsessive fear of life which has
been fanned abroad. Surely, it would
be better not to apply the brakes, if
we have to step on the accelerator
again soon afterwards. Spasmodic
population growth is the enemy of
harmonious social development and
an effective education policy.

British soccer star Bobby Charlton and
the British cycling team of Ian Hallam,
Willie Moore, Mick Bennett and Rick Evans
were awarded the 1973 Pierre de Couber-
tin International Fair Play Trophies at a
ceremony at Unesco House on June 7.

cited as an example of "fair play, modesty
and sporting spirit." The cycling team was
honoured for declining first place in the
finals of the world cycling championships
at San Sebastian, Spain, after the Fed.

Indian Government has prepared courses
on agriculture, health and family life, to
reach 5,000 villages. Unesco missions to
investigate the use of satellites for edu¬

Letters to the Editor
THE REAL STUMBLING BLOCK
Sir,
I wish to congratulate you on your
May 1974 issue on population, and
particularly on the clarity of the visual
presentation. I read with interest the
opposing articles by Frank Notestein
and Julian Simon on the relation bet¬
ween birth-rate and economic develop¬
ment. In point of fact, they are probably
both right, for the world provides many
examples of developing countries where
the Notestein thesis clearly seems to
be correct, while one could also point
to examples of industrialized countries
and some potentially rich but sparsely
populated countries where Simon's
point of view is apparently justified.
But what surprises me is that each
of these two writers declares that the
problem of demographic growth in the
world is not connected to that of avail¬
able natural resources. They are extra¬
ordinarily casual about this matter and
seem to take refuge in a blind faith
in the omnipotence of technology.
If it is true that "the world has never
been so close to being able to obtain
a supply of basic resources beyond the
imaginings of all previous generations'
(Notestein), or that "we now have avail¬
able to us vastly more resources of
almost every kind than did people in
any previous age" (Simon), it is un¬
fortunately quite as true that the rate
of growth of these resources has great
difficulty In keeping up with the com¬
bination of demographic growth and the
higher living standards demanded by
more and more people.
This struggle is particularly dramatic
in the case of food, and if Notesteln
is right to point out that "The less
developed nations of dense settlement
need to triple their food supply by the
end of the century", he does not seem
to be aware of the effort this will
require, even if they manage to achieve
it. In the same way, his comments on
"an almost unlimited supply of cheap
energy" are to say the least surpris¬
ing, at a time when the price of oil
has quadrupled and the future of energy,
especially nuclear energy, raises in¬
numerable questions.
I believe, on the contrary, that the
limitation of natural resources on a
limited planet, and certaipjy the diffi¬
culties and delays inherent in their
ever-increasing consumption, especially
as far as food is concerned, are one
of the essential factors to consider in
what is usually called the world popu¬
lation problem.

A DISCOVERY IN ART
Sir,
Bravo for your April 1974 issue on
archaeology and art, and particularly
for the article on Onufri, the great
16th-century Albanian painter of fantasy
and realism. Until now his work has
been virtually unknown., in spite of its
great significance in the development
of post-Byzantine art.
His painting of the Baptism of Christ
is a rich composition, and the face
of God the Father, looking down from
a luminous schematic cloud above,
clearly shows the influence of Western
art.
Unfortunately, this great painter is
unknown in our country and does not
figure in handbooks of Christian arîd
Byzantine archaeology.

MANDRAKE
THE MAGICIAN...
Sir,
I read the June 1974 issue of the
"Unesco Courler" with great interest.
Among the pictures illustrating the
article by Hakim Mohammed Said are
two on page 37 depicting the mand¬
rake, a plant about which I have written.
a short study. (In "Annales de la So¬
ciété d'Horticulture et d'Histoire Natu¬
relle de l'Hérault", n0' 3-4. 1966).
There can be no doubt that the
Muslim doctors shown In the miniature
are examining a genuine mandrake,
recognizable by its forked root, its
corona of leaves and its flowered stems.
On the other hand, the large photo on
the left of the page represents an imit¬
ation mandrake of the type mentioned
in the caption. It ¡s a root or a piece
of wood which has been carved in
human form.
Dr. D. Jarry
Faculty of Medicine
Montpellier, France
The object in the picture we published
is from the collection of Monsieur Roger
Caillois, who has sent us the following
reply. Ed.
Dr. Jarry casts doubt, not on the
authenticity of the object shown, but
on its botanical species, and with
reason.
I accept Dr. Jarry's comments as
perfectly accurate, though they hardly
needed making. The root I possess Is
not necessarily a root of the botanical
species mandrake, but a magical "mand¬
rake" named after the much sought-
after medicinal plant. Its extreme rarity
caused countless imitations to be made
by retouching suitable roots in such
a way as to give them a human appear¬
ance. It is quite possible that mand¬
rakes used for magical purposes were
never made from the real thing, in the
botanical sense. This is made clear in
Dr. Jarry's scholarly study. It is more
than likely indeed that sorcerers and
charlatans did not even bother to look
for this extremely rare plant, but instead
used roots which looked somewhat
similar.
My specimen comes from the Millau
region (France). It was found near a
petrifying fountain, which explains its
preservation. It is an "authentic fake",
so to speak. From the strict botanical
point of view, almost all "mandrakes"
are such fakes.
CELTIC HERITAGE
Sir,
Laurent David, of France, (Letters
to the Editor, May 1974) calls attention
to Celtic Civilization. We have received
something of this heritage, as descen¬
dants of the Celts here in Wales.
Celtic remains here are not plentiful,
but though the visual arts suffered, the
art of the poet took pride of place
from the sixth century onwards.
It is often said that there were no
"Dark Ages" in Wales and Ireland.
Was this because of the uplifting effect
of Celtic Civilization as well as that
of the Romans?

ECUADOR'S
ANCIENT POTTERY
I was especially interested in Jorge
Adoum's article on Ecuadorian pottery
(April 1974 issue).
I have long been familiar with the
book, "Travels among the Great Andes
of the Equator", written by the English
mountaineer Edward Whymper towards
the end of the 19th century, and recount¬
ing his work in Ecuador in 1879 and
1880. Whymper had a good deal to
say about Ecuadorian, antiquities, includ¬
ing dressed rocks found on Corazón,
and La Condamine's pyramids of Ouito,
but he also had a long chapter on stone
objects. These included what he called
"Stars in Stone", stone implements,
and household gods. This is in chapter
XIV of the bock, where he also discusses
old Indian pottery, musical whistles, and
vase busts. My edition, published by
John Murray, London, 1892, contains
numerous illustrations.
I think many English readers of the
"Unesco Courier" may want to get
"Travels Among the Great Andes" out
of the library.

The latest issue of Unesco's quarterly Interna¬
tional Social Science Journal (IM° 2 - 1974)
offers a very wide conspectus of scholarly
approaches to many aspects of the population
question which are being discussed in World
Population Year 1974.
Mitos Maçura (Yugoslavia) traces the
evolution of attitudes to population ques¬
tions in the forums of the United Nations
system.
Brian Johnson (U.K.) analyzes the impact
of population growth on the environment.
W. Ahmed (Pakistan) puts the question:
"How can one expect planned parenthood
to function in a largely unplanned world?"
Two Soviet demographers, V.S. Steshenko
and V.P. Piskunov, evaluate the effects
of ageing in populations and H.J. Heeren
(Netherlands) considers the problems
accompanying declining population
growth.
Further articles deal with population change and
education, attitudes towards abortion, shifting
economic structures and employment in India,
the economics of decision-making about family
size, and population education.

6,000,000 MORE
EVERY MONTH
"And tomorrow how many?" asked
the "Unesco Courier" on the cover of
its May 1974 issue, devoted to the
world demographic situation. The
world's population is in fact growing
by more than six million a month.
Six million more persons to feed,
educate, house and clothe: six million
more with a right to medical care,
social security and satisfying employ¬
ment. Cover drawing is one of a
series of posters published by the
International Labour Organization to
mark World Population Year. Others1
are reproduced in centre colour pages
(see page 34).
