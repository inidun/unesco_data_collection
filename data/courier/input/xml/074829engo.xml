The saint with a dog's head
There are many legends about St. Christopher, including one that he once carried Christ across a
river, thus earning his name (Christofàros in Greek, meaning ''bearer of Christ"). According to some
accounts he was a giant with a dog's face, only receiving human features at baptism. Other stories
relate that St. Christopher, an exceptionally good-looking man who lived in the 3rd century,
received such frequent attentions from the fair sex that he begged God to save him from temptation.
His prayer was answered by a miracle: from then on women who looked upon his handsome face
saw only the head of a dog. St. Christopher was thus often depicted with a dog's head, as in
this fresco painted in 1779 by a Greek artist in a 13th-century Byzantine church at Lindos, on
the island of Rhodes.

Horsemen repose in the shade of a leafy tree. One holds the bridle
of their two mounts while the other lies outstretched with his head
in the lap of a seated woman. This scene from the life of the nomads
of the steppes is depicted on a symmetrical pair of gold plaques once
worn on a sword-belt and preserved among the treasures of the art
collection of Tsar Peter the Great. They are one of the myriad ex¬
amples of the Creative genius of the artists of the steppes, homelands
of Scythian and Siberian horsemen 2,500 years ago. This issue of
the Unesco Courier is entirely devoted to this cultural universe which
flourished in Antiquity at the crossroads of Asia and Europe.

This golden stag (see detail in
colour, page 23) is a superb
example of typical Scythian
animal art. Discovered in a
tomb in the Kuban region,
north-east of the Black Sea, it
was made by a master-goldsmith
of the steppes early in the 6th
century B.C. In the words of
the Soviet archaeologist,
Aleksandr Shkurko, an authority
on early Scythian art, "The artist
was not unduly concerned with
modelling the animal's body or
adding precise detail. What
held his attention was its inner
qualitiesits strength, speed and
essential wildness. The
decorative treatment of the horns
and the compactness of the
composition confer on the image
an almost heraldic appearance."
The stag was a favourite theme
in the art of the Scythians.
SCYTHIAN WORLD
by
Boris B. Piotrovsky
BORIS BORISOVICH PIOTROVSKY,
Soviet archaeologist, is an Internationally
known authority on the history and art of
the Scythians. A member of the Academies
of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. and the Arme¬
nian S.S.R., he is Director of the Hermitage
Museum (Leningrad) which has a priceless
collection of Scythian artifacts. He is also
professor of Ancient Oriental History at the
Leningrad State University. The author of
important studies on the history, culture
and art of the ancient Orient and the Cau¬
casus, Prof. Piotrovsky is a corresponding
fellow of the British Academy, the French
Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres,
and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.
THE sweep and substance of
the Scythian world have only
recently been fully revealed,
although the existence of the Scy¬
thians was recorded long ago, and
they should not be regarded as one
of the forgotten peoples of history.
Herodotus, writing about them in
the fifth century B.C., included in his
detailed account a number of Scythian
or Greek legends concerning their
origins, and stated that the lands
which they occupied had previously
belonged to the Cimmerians.
The flatlands north of the Black
Sea, home of the Scythians who
caught Herodotus' attention when
they came down to do business in
the Greek trading-colonies on the
coast, are studded with kurgans.
These burial mounds of earth, erected
by the various nomadic tribes which
roamed across the steppes, were
themselves the subject of many a
legend, and the treasure-seekers who
plundered them in the past were
certainly rewarded on more than one
occasion.

a dynamic culture on thi

steppes
Many of them had been built by
the Scythians, and it was here that
the first archaeologists unearthed
outstanding examples of an art form
characteristic of Scythian culture and
dating mainly from the fifth to the
third centuries B.C. Since then, hard¬
ly a year has passed without the de¬
light of fresh discoveries by Ukrainian
archaeologists.
Excavations began a considerable
time ago. In 1763, a rich burial
mound of the early Scythian period
near Elizavetgrad (now Kirovograd)
yielded a large number of gold and
silver objects, including an iron aki-
nakes (the short dagger of the Scy¬
thians) the scabbard and hilt of which
were decorated in the ancient Eastern
style with fantastic animals and
anthropomorphic deities, gathered
round a sacred tree. These inte¬
resting finds were placed in the
Kunstkammer, Russia's first real
museum, which had been founded
by Peter the Great in 1714.
The Kunstkammer already con¬
tained a number of gold objects-
later identified as Scythianwhich had
been found in Siberian kurgans and
sent as gifts to Peter the Great in
1715 and 1716 by Nikita Demidov,
the owner of mines and metalworks
in the Urals, and by the Governor of
Tobolsk, Prince Gagarin. In 1718, a
special government decree ordered
"the collecting from earth and water
of old inscriptions, ancient weapons,
dishes and everything old and
unusual."

early nineteenth-century archaeolo¬
gists, was only explained and iden¬
tified when archaeological investiga¬
tions over a wide area gradually revea¬
led a considerable degree of cultural
unity in the wide belt of steppe-land,
foothills and upland pastures which
stretched between the 40th and 50th
parallels of latitude, from the Danube
in the west all the way to the Great
Wall of China in the easta distance
of more than 7,000 kilometres.
From one end to the other of this
territory, archaeologists have unear¬
thed identical pieces of horse gear,
iron swords, triangular arrowheads
and ornaments, all dating from the
Scythian period, while cultural simi¬
larities between different regions
are reflected in the widespread use
of imagery in the so-called "Scytho-
Siberian animal style."
But these links existed even ear¬
lier, and can certainly be clearly
detected in the pre-Scythian, Cim¬
merian period (i.e. the eighth century
B.C.). Convincing evidence of this
is provided by the objects found in
the Arzhan kurgan in the Tuva S.S.R.,
far to the east (see article page 38).
This ruined tomb of a military leader
yielded not only a number of items
similar to finds from the Ukraine and
Bulgaria, but also scraps of woven
cloth of Iranian origin, pre-dating
by almost 200 years the famous
Iranian carpet discovered during exca¬
vations of the Pazyryk kurgans of the
Altai (see article page 31).
Thus, in Cimmerian times, the con¬
ditions already existed for the esta¬
blishment of contacts between widely
separated territories, and for the
creation of a generalized, semi-noma¬
dic and stock-raising economy, in
which the dominance of horse-
breeding permitted mobility over long
distances.
The network of relationships bet¬
ween different tribes made up for the
lack of natural resources, and of
metal deposits in particular, in diffe¬
rent regions. The vast area covered
by Scythian culture, where the most
outstanding artifacts were made of
gold, silver or high-quality bronze,
contained few enough localities
where the first two of these metals
could be found, while tin, without
which copper could not be transfor¬
med into bronze "and which existed
in Central Europe and Bohemia, was
totally absent in the lands stretching
from the Danube as far as eastern
Kazakhstan.
Of course, there was no direct or
permanent contact between the no¬
madic tribes inhabiting the western
and eastern extremities of this world;
the elements which composed their
common culture were, so to speak,
"shuttled" from tribe to tribe, often
losing their stamp of origin in the
process.
We should also remember that
these breeders of cattle and horses,
whether Cimmerians or Scythians,
werefirst and foremostwell-armed
and highly mobile horse-soldiers,
whose rapidly moving war-parties,
according to Herodotus, penetrated
deep into Asia Minor.
Herodotus' accounts have since
been confirmed by ancient Eastern
sources, and by documentary and
archaeological evidence from Assyria
in particular. Reports by scouts of
the Assyrian king contained in the
archive of clay tablets found in the
Assyrian capital, Nineveh, refer to
the appearance of Cimmerians in
Asia Minor as early as the middle of
the 8th century B.C.
The participation of Scythians in
a devastating attack on Assyria a
century later is mentioned in a
chronicle of the Babylonian king
Nabopolassar which relates events
in 616-609 B.C., and in a 5th
century account of the sack of Nin¬
eveh, by the Armenian historian
Movses Horenatsi.
Excavations in seventh-century for¬
tresses in Transcaucasia (at Karmir-
MY KINGDOM
FOR A HORSE
Some Scythian jewels
reveal numerous details
of the dress, way of life
and customs of these
nomads of the steppes.
The two bearded Scythian
riders decorating the
ends of this torque, or
open necklace, of twisted
gold are one example.
The figures wear
ankle-length caftans tied
at the waist and long
trousers held by a strap
beneath the boot.
They ride bareback and
without stirrups. Their
mounts emerge from
the ends of the torque,
woven of six gold strands
bound in an intricately
decorated sheath inlaid
with enamel. The
horses' manes and the
harnesses and bridle bits
are rendered with great
precision. The torque,
of Greco-Scythian style
and weighing over
260 grammes, was found
in 1830. It encircled
the neck of a chieftain
in a 4th century B.C.
grave in the Crimea.
Blur, near Erivan) and in the central
region of ancient Urartu, near Lake
Van (in present-day Turkey), have
brought to light a number of items of
horse gear, iron weapons and beads
similar to objects found in ancient
Scythian burials of the Black Sea
region.
The Scythian connexion with Asia
Minor is clearly reflected in the so-
called "Ziwiyeh treasure" from Saq-
qez, in Iranian Kurdistan, discovered
during the Second World War.
Among the objects found here, which
were subsequently proved to have
come not from a treasure hoard but
from a tomb constructed in the
seventh century B.C., is an outstand¬
ing group of artifacts in which images
characteristic of both ancient Near
Eastern and Scythian art are
combined.
The golden objects in Scythian
style found at Ziwiyeh are similar to
finds from Scythian burial mounds,
such as the sword with a gold-covered

hilt and scabbard unearthed in 1763
in the Elizavetgrad (Kirovograd) kur-
gan in the Ukraine, and the gold-
handled sword and axe from the
Kelermes kurgans in the Kuban re¬
gion, excavated in 1902.
All these objects combine Scythian
motifs (reclining deer) with ancient
Eastern imagery (the holy tree with
its attendant divinities and fantastic
animals), and it is probably correct
to consider that they are imitations of
Urartean artifacts, modified by the
addition of elements in purely Scy¬
thian style.
Attempts have been made to re¬
late the birth of Scythian art to the
period of Scythian campaigns in
Asia Minor, but this theory is dispro¬
ved by the examples of Scythian and
pre-Scythian art discovered in Si¬
beria, which pre-date those from
Ziwiyeh (i. e. 7th century B.C.), but
are also decorated in the animal style.
The term "Scythian" is nowadays
applied to a large number of ethni¬
cally unrelated tribes, characterized
by a strong Iranian influence in their
personal and place-names. Its appli¬
cation is frequently limited to the
tribes inhabiting the coastal flatlands
of the Black Sea region.
But archaeologists have shown
that the early Scythian monuments
of this region are related to ancient
steppe cultures which go back as far
as the middle of the second millen¬
nium B.C. In this article the term
is used in a broader sense, including
in the "Scythian" world a vast mass
of tribes sharing the same economic
and cultural existence and spread
over a much wider area.
From the sixth to the third centu¬
ries B.C., the steppelands between
the Don, the Volga and the Urals
were the home of a culture similar
to that of the Black Sea Scythians.
The bearers of this culture, whom the
Greeks called Sarmatians, were in
turn linked with the tribes of Eastern
Kazakhstan, whose own culture is
brilliantly represented by a series of
gold plaques depicting reclining deer,
found in the sixth-century Chilik-
tinsky kurgan.
These links stretched beyond the
steppes of Kazakhstan still further,
to the High Altai, whose frozen
burial mounds have yielded perfectly
preserved collections of objects made
of wood, bone, felt and metal, in
which Chinese, Iranian and Scythian
influences are clearly apparent.
The development of Scythian cul¬
ture in the lands north of the Black
Sea was certainly affected by the
trading colonies which the Greeks
had established on the coast at the
end of the seventh century B.C., but
the Greeks themselves had already
encountered Scythians whose culture
owed nothing to outside influences,
and the objects which their gold¬
smiths made specially for Scythian
customers can be easily distinguished
from purely Scythian artifacts. Ob¬
jects of both types are now familiar
to us, as a result of excavations.
antiquities took place at the Kul Oba
kurgan near Kerch, on the straits
connecting the Black Sea to the Sea
of Azov, in 1830. A stone vault
under the mound proved to contain
a rich burial of the fourth century
B.C. with an outstanding collection
of Greek-made jewellery. Some of
the pieces, including a gold torque
decorated with figures of Scythian
horsemen, had obviously been made
specially for Scythian customers.
Of particular interest is a spheri¬
cally-shaped vase made of electrum
a natural gold-silver alloy), the body
of which is decorated with four
groups of figures illustrating a Greek
legend of the founding of the Scy¬
thian dynasty, which Herodotus also
recorded.
The scenes on the vase (analysed
in detail in an article on pages 1 5 and
16) depict the efforts of the three

gitaus) and a strange serpent-womarñr

shall lead the tribe, by being the
first to bend a bow left with their
mother by their father. Two of the
brothers fail the test, collecting in
the process nasty injuries typical of
clumsy bowmanship, but Scythes,
the youngest, succeeds.
Excavations of a great number of
kurgans in the coastal steppes around
the Black Sea, in the Crimea and in
the Northern Caucasus, during the
last half of the nineteenth century,
brought to light a number of magni¬
ficent examples of specifically Scy¬
thian art, and of Greek craftsman¬
ship commissioned by the Scythians.
Typical Scythian motifs s were the
reclining deer with branch-like antlers
and the panther, which possibly ser¬
ved as tribal symbols. These ani¬
mals decorate the solid gold plaques
on shields found in sixth-century
kurgans in the Kuban region; they
were also regularly depicted in the
decorations on quivers.
Links between the Scythians and
their western and southern neigh¬
bours are clearly reflected in the finds
from the kurgans. Scythian burials
in the Ukraine have yielded a number
of Thracian objects, an outstanding
example of which is the silver-trim
med bridle found in the Khomina
Mogila kurgan in 1970, whose de-'
corations include intricately engrav¬
ed plaques depicting animal heads.
The contents of the Chertomlyk
kurgan, excavated by I.E. Zabelin,
included a silver vaselater to become
famousdecorated in relief with
figures of Scythian horse-breeders,
and an iron sword whose gold hilt,
depicting two calves' heads and a
hunting scene, is a splendid example
of Iranian decoration of the fifth cen¬
tury B.C.
This sword, which was possibly a
trophy from the Greco-Persian or
Scytho-Persian wars, was in a gold
scabbard of Greek manufacture depic¬
ting a battle with the Persians, simi¬
lar in composition to the scenes of
the Battle of Marathon which
decorate Greek temples of the fifth
and fourth centuries B.C.
Iranian (Achaemenid) objects were
no rarity in Scythian burial mounds.
One of the several burial crypts of
the Great Bliznitsa kurgan on the
Taman peninsula, excavated between
1864 and 1868, contained two in¬
teresting objects of Near Eastern
origin : an Achaemenid seal-ring of
gold showing a king wrestling with
a lion; and an Egyptian amulet in
faience depicting the head of the
god Besa diminutive figure with
the face of a monster and a head¬
dress of feathers or palm-fronds.
This amulet could have arrived via
Iran, like the Egyptian alabaster ves¬
sel with hieroglyphic and cuneiform
inscriptions mentioning the name
of the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes
discovered in the southern Urals.
Scythian culture thus reflects the
relations with neighbouring and dis¬
tant lands which contributed to the
establishment of the link between
Eastern Europe and the Far East,
the wide east-west corridor which
was already open in the middle of
the last millennium of the pre-Chris¬
tian era and which, until the sixteenth
century A.D., would form the famous
Silk Route leading from the eastern
shores of the Mediterranean, through
Iran, Central Asia and Chinese Tur¬
kestan to the banks of the Hwang Ho
river. The world of the Scythians
fully deserves its place in ancient
history.

ANTIQUITY'S GREAT
REPORTER HISTORIAN
AMONG THE SCYTHIANS
modern archaeology
confirms the stories
of Herodotus
by
Yaroslav V. Domansky
AROUND the middle of the 5th
century B.C., a young man
named Herodotus left his
native city of Halicarnassus in Asia
Minor, and began the travels that
were to take him from the western
Mediterranean to Mesopotamia.
Vast distances lay ahead of him,
separating many different lands and
peoples : through the Aegean to the
islands of the Archipelago and the
towns of the Peloponnesus; east¬
wards to Babylon; westwards as far
as Sicily; southwards to Egypt and
the banks of the Nile; northwards
through the Balkan peninsula to
Thrace. And one day Herodotus
arrived in Olbia, one of the most
northerly of the Greek city-colonies,
on the shores of the Black Sea.
Founded a century-and-a-half
earlier on the estuary of the river
Bug, Olbia was thriving, and fully
living up to its name ("olbia", in
Greek, meant "prosperous").
But although he was usually
curious about everything, neither
Olbia's present nor its past parti¬
cularly interested the young man
from Halicarnassus as he stood on
the city walls. He was looking
outwards, over the vast plain which
stretched away into the distance.
Somewhere out there, beyond
the horizon, lived the Scythians,
the people who, after an exhausting
war, had finally humiliated Darius,
king of the Persians.
The Greeks themselves had resis-i
ted the Persian invaders for many!
YAROSLAV VITAL'EVICH DOMANSKY,
a leading Soviet historian and archaeologist,
is a senior member of the staff of the Her¬
mitage Museum in Leningrad. An authority
on the antiquities of the region north of
the Black Sea, about which he has written
a number of works, he has excavated many
sites along the lower reaches of the river Bug
in the Ukraine.

<![CDATA[
L years, and it was Herodotus' ambi-'
' tion to write the history of that war.
Obviously, the Scythians must come
into the story.
There were a great number of
people in Olbia who had spent their
lives in the steppes, who had tra¬
velled the length and breadth of the
lands north of the Black Sea, and
who had many a tale to tell about
the world of the Scythians, so dif¬
ferent from that of the Greeks.
Herodotus was an attentive listen¬
er, and the contrasts with the way
of life which he had known at home
fascinated him. He wanted to
write about all things unusual,
leaving nothing out, and so he col¬
lected all these talesincluding the
unlikely onesfrom his Greek and
Scythian informants, one of whom,
a certain Tymnes, had actually been
a man of confidence of the Scythian
king Ariapeithes.
What Herodotus saw for himself
in Olbia, and what he heard, formed
a colourful patchwork picture of the
Scythian world and Scythian ways,
in which the past and the present,
the important and the insignificant,
the possible and the highly improb¬
able jostled for space, and which
he would incorporate in the pages
of his History.
Thus, the first record of its kind,
by the man who has been called the
"Father of History", would contain
an account of one of the first peoples
identifiable by name to have inhabi¬
ted what is now part of the Soviet
Union.
Herodotus was in Olbia in or
about the year 450 B.C. Five years
later, he was reading parts of his
manuscript to the citizens of Athens,
who were so impressed that they
offered him a grant of money to
continue with his project.
Let us listen with them now to
the words of the narrator: "Their land
is level, well-watered, and abound¬
ing in pasture"... "Having neither
cities nor forts, and carrying their
dwellings with them wherever they
go; accustomed, moreover, one and
all of them, to shoot from horse¬
back; and living not by husbandry
but their cattle, their waggons the
only homes that they possess..."
Thus Herodotus describes the
nomadic life of the Scythians,
roaming in hordes over the "vastness
of the great plain" between the
Danube and the Don, women and
children in the waggons and the men
on horseback, ready at any moment
to defend their families and their
herds with their spears and with the
bows and arrows which they handled
with such skill.
Being "entirely bare of trees", the
land of the Scythians was "utterly
barren of firewood." They stuffed
their meat, haggis-wise, into the
stomach of the animal, and cooked
it in cauldrons over a fire made
with the animal's own bones. In
A PLEDGE
OF BROTHERHOOD
Like many pieces of Scythian
jewellery, this gold
ornamental plaque for
clothing reveals a custom
among the nomads of the
steppes. It shows two
Scythians making a pledge
of everlasting brotherhood in
a ritual also described by
Herodotus. They kneel nose
to nose, their profiles joined
together, and hold a single
horn-shaped vessel in which
they have mingled drops of
their blood with wine.
The symbolism whereby two
become one is also reflected
in the conception of the
plaque: when the two
profiles are viewed in
close-up (see enlarged detail,
opposite page) .they form a
single face. This technique
of "split representation" is
relatively common in
Scythian animal art (see
colour photo page 28) but
is rarely found applied to
the human face. A
remarkable example of the
Scythian goldsmiths'
virtuosity, this 4th century
B.C. plaque is less than
4 cms. high.

Mountain goats and rams frisking between flowers and palmettes
bordered by two twisted cords of gold (below) evoke the pastoral
life of nomad herdsmen who roamed the steppes 2,500 years ago in
an endless quest for water and pastureland. Detail shown here is
the central motif of a gold pectoral (breast ornament) unearthed
in 1868 in a burial crypt of the Great Bliznitsa tomb near the Sea
of Azov. This masterpiece was considered a matchless example of
Scythian jewellery until 1971, when an even more splendid
princely pectoral of similar style was discovered (see page 19).
this way comments Herodotus, "the
ox is made to boil himself, and other
victims also do the like."
Drinkers of mare's milk, the Scy¬
thians were also copious quarters of
imported wine, which they never
diluted with water. "Serve us in
Scythian style !" called the Greeks,
when the drink was flowing merrily.
True children of the steppe, the
Scythians were born herdsmen, al¬
though like their ancestors they also
hunted wild animals. Herodotus
was mainly concerned with the no¬
mads, but he also noted that some
Scythians were "engaged in hus¬
bandry".
"Abundantly provided with the
most important necessaries", they
were favoured with a land watered
by many rivers, including the Borys-
thenes (the Dnieper) which, he tells
us, "has upon its banks the loveliest
and most excellent pasturage for
cattle; it contains abundance of the
most delicious fish; its water is most
pleasant to the taste; its stream is
limpid... the richest harvests spring
up along its course."
This sounds idyllic, but the life of
the Scythians was in reality a hard
one. Their manners and customs
reflected a cruel age, and the "Father
of History" has left a detailed des¬
cription of the Scythians at war.
As pitiless with their enemies as
they were loyal to their friends, they
set great store by ritual oath-taking.
Parties to a treaty shed some of their
blood into a bowl filled with wine, and
then plunged into the mixture "a
sword, some arrows, a battle-axe and
a spear, all the while repeating
prayers", after which the allies each
drank from the bowl.
Herodotus noted with particular in¬
terest that the Scythians were not
much given to the use of "¡mages,
altars or temples", but he listed their
gods, identifying them with their
Greek equivalents and mentioning
their role in the order of things.
Tahiti, whom the Greeks knew as
Hestia, protected the household. Pa-
paeus (Zeus) was"very properly, in
my judgement", comments Herodo¬
tus charge of celestial affairs,
while his wife Apia dealt with more
earthly matters. The Greek god
Heracles, known to the Scythians as
Targitaus, was believed to have been
the first man ever to live in their
country, the father of their people.
The Scythians sacrificed domestic
animals, and horses in particular, to
all these gods, as well as to Ares,
the god of war, the only divinity in
whose honour they erected altars, in
the form of huge piles of brushwood
topped with antique iron swords.
The sacrificial victims included not
only cattle and horses, but also one
out of every hundred of their prisoners
of war.
Scythia had "an abundance of |

i by means of bundles of willow
; wands". When the king fell sick, it
was their task to identify the traitor
whose false oath by the king's hearth
had caused the illness, and who was
promptly beheaded. In doubtful
cases, the king sought a second opi¬
nion; if the accused man was ac¬
quitted, the unfortunate soothsayers
lost their own heads.
The Scythians were convinced
that there was a life beyond the grave,
picturing it as a continuation of what
had gone before. Herodotus gives
us a detailed description of the royal
funerals, when elaborate prepara-,
tions were made to ensure that the
king lacked nothing in his after-life.
After digging a deep, rectangular
grave, the Scythians placed the em¬
balmed body of their king on a
waggon, and took it on a royal pro¬
gress from tribe to tribe. The
mourners mutilated their own ears,
cropped their hair, lacerated their
arms, forehead and nose, and thrust
an arrow through their left hands.
Returning to the grave, they lower¬
ed the king into the ground on a
litter, which they surrounded with
a fence of spears. Then they built a
ceiling of beams over the tomb, and
thatched it with a roof of twigs.
In the open space around the king,
they buried one of his concubines,
first killing her by strangling, "together
with« his cup-bearer, his cook, his
groom, his lackey, his messenger,
some of his horses, firstlings of all
his other possessions, and some
golden cups..." Finally, says Hero¬
dotus, "they set to work, and raise
a vast mound over the grave, all of
them vying with each other and seek¬
ing to make it as tall as possible."
But this was not the end of the
affair. A year later, fifty of the late
king's attendants were strangled and
impaled on the backs of fifty slaught¬
ered horses. Firmly attached to
stakes and arranged in a circle, this
ghostly guard of honour was left to
protect the burial mound.
Every Scythian was bound to res¬
pect his gods, and betrayal was
severely punished. In Olbia, Herodo¬
tus heard the cautionary tale of Scy-
las, son and heir of the Scythian king
Ariapeithes, who "disliked the Scythie
mode of life, and was attached, by
his up-bringing, to the manners of the
Greeks." Scylas had installed one of
his wives, "who was a native of the
place", in a large house in Olbia, and
when he visited the city, as he did
frequently, he dressed in Greek clothes
and followed the Greek customs and
rites, even joining in the Bacchanalian
revels, which the Scythians consid¬
ered offensive.
Seeing him the worse for wear,
some kinsmen of Scylas told tales at
home, and the ensuing indignation
led to a revolt against Scylas, who
was obliged to decamp to Thrace.
But he soon fell into the hands of
his successor on the throne, and was
beheaded without further delay.
"Thus rigidly do the Scythians main¬
tain their own customs," wrote Hero¬
dotus, "and thus severely do they
punish such as adopt foreign usages."
The Scythians fascinated Herodo¬
tus in many ways, but there was one
matter in particular, to which he
frequently referred, in which they had,
he considered, "shown themselves
wiser than any nation upon the face
of the earth... The one thing of
which I speak, is the contrivance
whereby they make it impossible for
the enemy who invades them to
escape destruction, while they them¬
selves are entirely out of his reach,
unless it please them to engage with
him."
Herodotus' tale of the Scythians
contains a wealth of historical, geo¬
graphical and ethnographical material.
His colourful account of the campaign
of Darius is embellished with digres¬
sions which are irrelevant to the
main theme, but which reveal the
extent to which posterity is indebted
to the "Father or History" for its
knowledge of the ancient world and,
more particularly, of the structure of
Scythian society.
Herodotus could obviously not
have been expected to foresee that
this subject would be of such interest
to future historians, and to give the
matter more than a passing glance,
but his casual approach hasit must
be admittedplaced his successors
in a very difficult position.
So much of what he wrote about
the Scythians remains open to diffe¬
rent interpretations, and controversy
continues to bedevil any attempt by
modern scholars to understand his
writings and to relate them to other
sources.
According to Herodotus, the struc¬
ture of Scythian society was tribal,
and it is clear that ancient tribal links
could, on occasion, provoke united
action by all the kinsmen. But this
bond had lost its earlier, all-embracing
significance, and the patriarchal fa¬
mily had become the basic social unit.
The customs of the Scythians reveal
a male-dominated society, under the
authority of the chief, with women
in a position of dependence.
Scythian society was not egalita¬
rian, but on the contrary, relatively
class-ridden. Although most Scy¬
thians were free men, irrespective of
personal power or wealth, there was
also a slave class, whose existence
and activities are described by Hero¬
dotus, as well as a property-owning
and aristocratic minority, composed
of the leaders of the richest families,
the royal entourage and the warrior
chieftains, all under the supreme
authority of the king.
Scythia was ruled by tribal alliances.
At the time of the Persian invasion
under Darius, at the end of the sixth
century B.C., it was divided into
three kingdoms, under the overall
command of Idanthyrsus who had vir¬
tually unlimited power, whether in the
conduct of military affairs, the distri-

WHAT THE WELL-DRESSED HORSEMAN WORE
How Scythian horsemen of 2,500 years ago
dressed and the kind of equipment they used
is now known to the last detail (drawing right).
This knowledge came with the discovery of a
remarkably preserved set of accoutrements buried
with a 5th-century-B. C. warrior in a Ukraine
tomb (below). The conical helmet complete
with earflaps, the leather back-piece covered
with metal scales, the sword-belt of bronze
plaques and the breast-plate had all survived.
Some of this equipment is depicted on a stone
stele of the same period (left) as well as a long
sword, a sheathed dagger, a rhyton (horn-shaped
drinking cup) and a gorytus (quiver for bow and
arrows). The warrior's outfit also included
leg armour laced to trousers which were tucked
into flat-soled felt boots.

bution of booty or the destiny of
individual Scythians, who could be
pressed into service at will and whose
disobedience was punishable by
death.
We have already seen the fate
reserved for those who betrayed their
oath at the hearth of the king. In
The technical mastery with which
the Scythians embellished even their
everyday objects is seen in their
cauldrons, knives, perfume braziers,
lamps, amphoras, jars, stools and a
variety of other elegantly wrought
utensils. The three objects shown
at left are about 2,500 years old :
1 Bronze lamp to hold six wicks
(11 cms. high).
2 Bronze mirror (18 cms. diameter)
with fluted handle topped by a
panther.
3 Bronze meat-strainer or sieve
used for lifting boiling meat from
the pot. A wooden stick was
inserted in the hollow handle.
anticipation of the king's own demise,
a substantial stock of sacrificial
material, including slaves as well as
horses and precious objects, was kept
handy.
The Scythian king was above all a
military leader. War, as a source of
prosperity, enabling the aristocrats to
acquire riches and wealth, was a
regular activity, and the life of the
Scythians, who were constantly' in
arms, was permeated with martial
arts, traditions and customs.
This mass of warriors was capable
of bending the sovereign's will. A
primitive form of democracy from
earlier times survived, for example, in
the assemblies which united all the
men-at-arms in discussion of matters
of importance and whichas was pro¬
bably the case of the unfortunate
Scylascould decide the fate of the
king himself.
Scythian society was full of contra¬
dictions. With the exception of one
or two excursions into the past, Hero¬
dotus was writing about events in the
middle of the fifth century B.C., a
chapter of Scythian history which was
to be followed by many others. It
was a period of change in all respects,
but the old ways of life had not been
entirely abandoned, and would leave
their imprint on all that came after¬
wards.
Altogether, the Scythians occupied
the stage of history for some thousand
years, about as long as Ancient Rome,
living through a series of experiences
which left no trace behind them.
But the little that we do know reflects
a dramatic destiny, full of variety and
conflict.
There is no doubt that in the
seventh century B.C., the Scythians
were the scourge of the East. In
612 B.C., they had joined in sacking
the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. Three
hundred years later they were to
suffer defeat at the hands of Philip of
Macedón.
In the sixth century, they had
confirmed their independence by
routing Darius and his Persian army;
at the end of the second century, the
Greeks were to rout them in battle
after battle in the Crimea.
At the dawn of their history, they
had mounted almost unbelievable
raids as far as Egypt; as the sun set,
they would be confined to a small
area of the Crimean steppe, the
horses on which they had ridden so
proudly throughout their history ex¬
changed for the tools of farmers. w

reflected Hellas, they were finally to
mingle with the crowds in the Greek
trading-cities of the Black Sea coast.
Warriors who had smashed every¬
thing that lay in their path, they
would value artistic creation, and
become outstanding craftsmen them¬
selves.
And when, in the third century
A.D., Scythia and the ancient Scy¬
thians had ceased to exist, the once-
terrible name remained, and was
adopted by those who occupied their
former territories, including the early
Slavs.
Silence fell over the Scythians for
fifteen hundred years. And then, at
the turn of the eighteenth-nineteenth
centuries, the past became the future,
as their monuments began to speak.
All manner of Scythian relics awaited
the spades of the archaeologists; the
time was rapidly approaching when'
the truth of Herodotus' tales could be
put to the test.
The study of Scythian antiquities
began soon after the lands north of
the Black Sea became Russian terri¬
tory. Since then, a great number of
monuments have been investigated,
among the most important of which
are the famous burial mounds, or
kurgans.
Many of these mounds marked the
last resting-place of chieftains or
kings, and proved to be complex
constructions in the form of crypts or
catacombs, containing a great variety
of objects. Some of them had been
plundered long ago, but what the
robbers had rejected was of the great¬
est interest to the archaeologists.
The inventory of everyday objects
is a long one, and includes bronze
cauldrons and earthenware utensils;
gold rings, bracelets, necklaces, pen¬
dants and ornaments for the head;
costume jewellery in metalware
(usually stitched to the garment);
swords, battle-axes, spears, arrows,
quivers, scabbards and armour; har¬
ness for horses and ritual articles.
Various materials were used in
their production, ranging from gold,
bronze and clay to iron, silver, bone
and stone. The objects themselves
came from a variety of sources, some
of them being of local manufacture
and others imported from abroad
honestly purchased, looted by raiding-
parties or obtained through trade
with other tribes.
Excavation on the whole confirmed
Herodotus' account of life in the
steppes, at least as far as its material
aspects were concerned, and justified
his claim to be considered as the
founder of historical science.
With one or two inaccuracies or
omissions, what the archaeologists
discovered in the royal tombs matches
his descriptions of the funerals of
kings. The bronze cauldrons which
they unearthed correspond to those in
which, according to Herodotus, the
Scythians boiled their meat, and if
14
they found quantities of wood-ash,
ashes from the hearths of at least one
settlement indicate that bones did on
occasion replace firewood.
In 1830, a new page was turned in
the history of the study of Scythian
antiquities when excavations began
at the Kul Oba kurgan near Kerch, on
the straits between the Black Sea
and the Sea of Azov. Among the
many objects brought to light was a
unique collection of articles which
have attracted the attention of scho¬
lars ever since.
Under the mound was a stone
crypt containing three bodies, buried
in the fourth century B.C., together
with a quantity of gold artifacts dec¬
orated in a manner never seen before
and depicting scenes in the life of a
warrior people whose clothes, head¬
gear and general appearance in no
way resembled those of the Greeks.
A solid gold torque was decorated
with figures of horsemen, and gold
ornaments sewn to the clothing of the
dead people were embossed with
figures of bowmen firing arrows,
riders brandishing spears and soldiers
with quivers and bow-cases attached
to their belts.
Who were the warriors portrayed
in these scenes? The immediate
opinion of the archaeologists who had
unearthed these objects was correct.
They were Scythians, drawn, as it
were, "from life".
For the first time, scholars whose
only acquaintance with an ancient
people had come through the pages
of Herodotus and other writers found
themselves face-to-face with Scy¬
thian realities. What did they look
like ? How did they arm themselves?
What did they wear? How did they
behave? The answers were there,
before their very eyes.
Kul Oba was only the first in a
series of burial mounds to yield metal
objects portraying the Scythians. In
1 862, excavations began in the extra¬
ordinary Chertomlyk kurgan near the
Dnieper, which produced a gold and
silver vase decorated with a frieze of
sculptured human figures and horses
similar to those found on objects from
Kul Oba, and which is generally consi¬
dered to depict the horse-breeders
and horse-breakers of the Scythian
steppes.
In 1912-1913, the neighbouring
Solokha kurgan, which was also a
royal tomb, produced further objects
decorated with scenes from Scythian
life, including a golden comb portray¬
ing Scythian warriors in battle.
We have mentioned only a few of
the most significant discoveries made
in the late nineteenth and early-
twentieth centuries and illustrating
the "Scythian theme" in ancient art.
The most immediate impression
which they leave is one of artistic and
technical perfection. The golden
comb referred to above, for example,
is composed of a number of finely-

IN the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C.,
Scythian artists and Greek artists
who had settled in the Scythian
territories began to provide the local
Scythian nobility with beautiful pieces
of craftsmanship made according to
the tastes of their patrons and incor¬
porating many subjects and motifs.
Did these motifs merely depict
scenes from everyday life or were
they themes of greater significance?
Professor Boris N. Grakov, a leading
Soviet authority on Scythian culture,
has affirmed that the content and
style of these scenes are too specific
for them to be merely representa¬
tions of everyday situations. He
sees them as possible representations
of Scythian myths.
By comparing these portrayals with
the information given us by Classical
authors, we should be able to recon¬
struct Scythian mythology.

Herodotus relates the Scythian
legend of the first hero, who was
known to the Scythians as Targitaus,
but whom the Greek colonists of the
Black Sea region, and Herodotus also,
referred to as Heracles, the famous
hero of Greek myth.
At the beginning of the 1950s,
Professor Grakov put forward the
interesting hypothesis that the num¬
erous Scythian representations of a
man fighting with a fantastic beast all
depict the exploits of Targitaus.
Professor Grakov also claimed that
such works were popular among the
Scythians because Targitaus, accor¬
ding to Herodotus, was considered
to be the direct ancestor of the
Scythian kings. Is it possible, then,
to identify features in Scythian art
which directly relate to the myth of
Targitaus ?
According to one version of this
legend, Targitaus-Heracles had three
sons. In order to determine which
of them was the most worthy of
becoming the ruler of the Scythians, ¡'
he decided to put them to a test.
Each had to attempt to string his
father's bow and strap on the belt
which he wore in battle. This trial
required, as may well be imagined,
great strength and skill, and only
the youngest of the brothers. Scythes,
succeeded. According to the legend
he then became the first ruler of the
Scythians and his two older brothers
were sent into exile.
This subject is depicted in an
astonishing number of works of
Scythian art. At the beginning of
this century a small ritual silver ves¬
sel (drawing 1) which clearly origi¬
nated from the Black Sea area, was
found in a tomb along the course of
the Don.
Six male figures are represented on
this vessel, grouped in three paired
scenes. One of the figures reappears
in all three scenes. He is an elderly
Scythian with long hair and a beard.
In one of the scenes (4) he is repre¬
sented in conversation with another
Scythian. Another scene (5) is more
important: the same character bids
farewell to a warrior who holds a
spear in each hand and may be
setting off on an expedition to distant
lands.
But it is the third scene (6) which
seems to be the most significant of
all: the same hero proffers his bow
to his companion, who is clearly the
youngest person in the grouphe has
not yet even grown the customary
Scythian beard.
/ZJX'
All the details of this composition
seem to indicate that it is a represen¬
tation of Targitaus and his three sons.
Two of them he is exiling from his
realm. Targitaus even holds up
three fingers to the departing warrior,
as if to remind him that all the bro¬
thers had been subjected to the test.
Meanwhile he proffers his bow to
the third and youngest son as a
symbol of his victory and as an
emblem of his power.
A few years ago, during the exca¬
vations at Gaimanova Mogila in the
Ukraine, a vessel (drawing 2, page 14
and photo page 17) was found
showing another young Scythian
taking an oblong object from the
hands of an older man. Unfortunate¬
ly that part of the vessel (drawing 7,
page 1 6) was seriously damaged and
the object cannot be made out.
But the content of the scene and
the appearance of the characters
make it possible for us to see here
the very moment at which Targitaus
hands his . bow to his youngest
son. On the opposite side of the
vessel are two other Scythians, who
may well be the victor's exiled
brothers.
Now let us turn to the most re-w
nowned Scythian ritual vessel (3). r

, Made of gold and 1 3 cm high, it was
found almost a century and a half
ago in the Kul Oba kurgan on the
Kerch Peninsula in the Crimea.
A frieze encircles the vase, repre¬
senting seven Scythians, busy at dif¬
ferent occupations. One of them
is kneeling on his right knee, his
left leg over a bow, stretching it,
while he strings it with the right hand
and holds it steady with the left.
This may be a representation of the
feat that Targitaus asked of his sons.
If this is so how can we interpret
what is happening in the other scenes
on the vase? One Scythian is ban¬
daging the wounded leg of another.
Beside him, another Scythian is
probing for something with his
thumb and forefinger in the mouth
of his companion. The explanation
of this somewhat unexpected scene
is as follows.
When unstrung, the Scythian bow
is curved at both ends in the opposite
direction from the bow-string (in the
form of a cursive letter "w" with a
hook on each end). If the archer
attempts to draw it tight in the
manner indicated on the vase, but
does not have the necessary strength
and dexterity, the wood can spring
back violently, wounding him by a
blow either on the left leg or the
lower jaw.
The force of the backlash is such
that it may be capable of breaking
a bone and could certainly dislodge a
tooth. Perhaps Targitaus's older
sons received these wounds, through
not being able to carry out their
father's test. Is this what we see on
the vessel from Kul Oba ?
What did the Scythians imaginé
happened to Targitaus's older sons?
Herodotus does not tell us, but
world folklore recounts numerous
versions of the rivalry between three
brothers, in which the youngest is
victorious. These versions differ in
many details but usually have the
same ending: the older brothers,
enraged by the younger's success,
slay him.
This is how the story ends in the
narrative of the three sons of Ferey-
dun, the hero of an ancient Iranian
epic, whose general characteristics,
resemble those of the Scythian
Targitaus.
The scene shown on the Gaimanova
Mogila vase described above sug¬
gests that the end of the Scythian
myth may be very similar. The two
From right to left: a Scythian wearing a pointed helmet
bandages his comrade's leg. Another seems to be acting
as a dentist, probing in the mouth of his companion. Yet
another is stringing his bow, a task said to have
been given to the sons of Targitaus. Two more
figures seem to be gossiping while they lean on their
spears. The drawing depicts a frieze decorating an electrum
(gold and silver alloy) vase discovered at Kul Oba
in the Crimea (drawing n° 3, page 14).
persons who represent, according
to our interpretation, the elderbrothers
are heavily armed, while the youngest
brother and the father have only
bows. Has the artist not por¬
trayed here the precise moment
when the two brothers hatch their
murderous plot against their vic¬
torious rival ?
Another renowned Scythian trea¬
sure is the gold comb (4th century
B.C.) from the Solokha kurgan, in
the lower Dnieper River region (see
photo page 8). Two Scythian war¬
riors, one on foot and the other on
horseback, are attacking and van¬
quishing a third one. Could these
also be the sons of Targitaus?
A Roman poet, Caius Valerius
Flaccus (Ist century A. D.) confirms
this theory in his poem "The Argo-
nautica!'
In the midst of items which have
nothing to do with the myth, he
suddenly mentions a combat between
two individuals whose names are very
similar in sound to those of Targitaus-
Heracles' sons. His description of
the combat also evokes that represen¬
ted on the comb: the warrior's horse
is dead, he himself is wounded, death
will soon overtake him...
Thus, such artistic representations
make it possible to link together the
fragments of Scythian myths preser¬
ved by different authors and to
reconstruct on this basis a single
connected narrative.
The popularity of the legend of
Targitaus and his sons and the fre¬
quent enactment of this subject on
ritual objects should not surprise us.
After all, this was a dynastic myth,
which supported the Scythian kings'
claim to the throne.
However, it must be admitted that
these interpretations are still not
unanimously accepted, and that
there are other possible explana¬
tions and approaches to this subject.
Meanwhile the search for the truth
continues...

Four Ukrainian archaeologists
present their latest finds
IN the steppes of Eastern Europe
large earthen mounds mark the
burial places of ancient Scythian
rulers. These royal "kurgans" were
in most cases plundered in antiquity
by thieves in search of the hoards of
gold hidden within the tombs.
For the first time, during the past
six or seven years, systematic exca¬
vations of Scythian kurgans have
been carried out on a large scale,
using the latest scientific methods,
by expeditions from the Institute of
Archaeology of the Academy of
Sciences of the Ukrainian S. S. R.
Undertaken in connexion with
extensive land improvement projects
in the south of the Ukraine, the
research on the royal tombs has
aroused tremendous interest. Al
though they were first excavated in
the 19th and at the start of the 20th
century, and had been pillaged in
ancient times, the tombs were still
found to contain an astonishing wealth
of treasures.
The many objects unearthed include
remarkable pieces of jewellery, orna¬
tely decorated weapons, gold and
silver vessels and other outstanding
works of ancient art. They have now
become part of the world's cultural
heritage.
Among the best known of the royal
kurgans dating from the 4th and 3rd
centuries B.C. are those of Chertom-
lyk, Solokha, Oguz, Alexandropol',
Kozel, Bol'shaia Tsymbalka and
Chmyrev, all situated in the Dnepro¬
petrovsk, Zaprozhye or Kherson
regions of the Ukraine. The famous
kurgan of Kul Oba, near Kerch, in the
Crimea, can also be included among
these tombs by virtue of the wealth
of objects it contained.
On the following pages, Ukrainian
archaeologists present a few of their
most recent discoveries.

2 - the golden cup of Gaimanov
DURING 1969-70, the Gaima-
nova Mogila kurgan, which
occupies a central position
among more than 50 burials of Scy¬
thian warriors, was excavated and
studied by an expedition from the
Institute of Archaeology of the Aca¬
demy of Sciences of the Ukrainian
S.S.R. Gaimanova Mogila is s¡tu-¡
ated near the village of Balka in the
Vasil'ievska district of the Zaporozhye
region.
In comparison with the other
kurgans, which are about 1 to 1.5
metres high, Gaimanova Mogila is
remarkable for its sizeover 8 metres
high and about 80 metres in diameter.
Its enormous size, its sharp outlines
against the flat steppe landscape and
its gleaming white stone facing
emphasized the exceptional impor¬
tance of the individual buried in it.
Gaimanova Mogila served as a
burial vault for Scythian royalty, and
the funeral objects discovered in it
correspond in many details to the
customs associated with the burial of
Scythian kings as described by Hero¬
dotus. We found golden and silver
vessels, the attributes of Scythian
royal power, cups, horns for wine, a
drinking bowl, a pitcher, and the bo¬
dies of those servants who, according
to Herodotus, were buried with a king.
However, Gaimanova Mogila's
fame as one of the most valuable
historical monuments of Scythia is
not solely due to the extremely rich
finds of eating and cooking utensils
and the several thousand excellent
pieces of jewellery. The most impor¬
tant discoveries were the objects
buried in the cache of the northern
tomb. These included golden and
silver ritual vessels, as well as three

wooden cups with rolled gold discs
along the rim; also in the cache were
a flat silver drinking cup and two
drinking horns, with silver bases and
golden mouths and tips in the forms
of the head of a ram and a lion.
These objects were accompanied by
silver pitchers and a round drinking-
bowl placed in a gilded silver vessel.
With the exception of the large
drinking horn and the wooden cups
which are the work of a local Scythian
craftsman, the remaining objects in
the cache are made in the style of
Greek art of the 4th century B.C.
and show clear links with the jewel¬
lery workshops of the Bosphorus.
The most outstanding work of
Scytho-Classical art found in the
Gaimanova Mogila kurgan is a small
spherical gilded silver cup, with two
flat horizontal handles decorated with
rams' heads. The central design
on the cup is a wide frieze in high
relief, depicting Scythian warriors.
The warriors stand against a
background showing an open, stony
area and are connected with each
other by their involvement in com¬
mon activities. They are superbly
integrated into the form of the vessel.
The four major figures are displayed
in pairs on the surface of the cup; the
other two kneel under the cup's
handles. [For an interpretation of
these figures on the golden cup of
Gaimanov see article page 15].
On one side of the cup stand two
elderly warriors, engaged in conversa¬
tion. Long-haired and bearded, they
are dressed in rich clothing and carry
ceremonial precious weaponry. Their
long kaftans, with triangular gussets,
are trimmed with fur and embroidered
on the shoulders and chest with
fantastical designs. Their hairstyles
are highly distinctive, and their
weapons in particular betoken the
highest authority. The mace of the
warrior on the right and the two-
thonged whip held by the one on the
left, suggest that the two men belon¬
ged to the elite of Scythian leaders.
On the opposite side of the cup
an elderly bearded warrior and a
young Scythian are conversing.
Their clothing is just as luxurious,
their weapons just as costly, but
their poses are somewhat different.
The young Scythian holds in his right
hand a ritual drinking-bowl, and his
left hand is outstretched, like that
of the elderly warrior. Under one
handle of the vessel, a youth on his
knees is prostrating himself before a
wineskin, while the kneeling figure
under the other handle is an elderly
warrior, with his gorytus (the combi¬
nation quiver and bow-case typical
of the Scythians) beside him. He
has one hand stretched up to his
forehead and is gripping something
with the other.
All the figures are gilded, and only
the faces and hands are silver. Each
image is individual in style. It is
worth emphasizing that this is the
first known example of Scythian
décorative art depicting Scythian
leaders of the highest rank.

Scythian idyll
on a royal
breastplate
On this gold pectoral or breast¬

making this masterpiece of the
goldsmith's art (30 cm. in diameter)
a vivid portrayal of Scythian

and sewing a sheepskin tunic.
They wear the typical trousers
and boots of the nomad horsemen

B.C. Greco-Scythian pectoral
was wrought near the Black Sea
and was discovered in the Ukraine
in 1971 in a Scythian ruler's tomb.
Photo O APN, Moscow
THE excavations in 1971 of
Tolstaya Mogila, one of the
most magnificent royal tombs
of Scythia, turned out to be a momen¬
tous event for archaeology. In thé
centre of the tomb was the burial
of the ruler himself, with beside him
two pits for the burial of horses and
the three tombs of his leading grooms.
In the south-western part of the
kurgan two dark patches marked the
entrances to a side tomb, which had
escaped plunder.
In this tomb lay the skeleton of a
young Scythian woman, probably the
wife of the ruler. All her clothesher
dresses, veils and sandalswere
embroidered with ornamental golden
discs. Her jewellery was of gold.
Beside the woman was an alabaster
sarcophagus containing the body of a
child who had died later and had
been carried into the grave through
a separate entrance. The whole of
its tiny skeleton was also covered in
golden plaques, rings, bracelets and
neck ornaments.
Everything was in a perfect state of
preservation when, 2,300 years after
the burial, the first archaeologists
entered the grave. But although the
central grave had been plundered,
in it were found the objects which
were to make Tolstaya Mogila world-
famous. These were the most pre¬
cious of the king's ceremonial
emblems of authority: a sword cov¬
ered in gold, a gold-wrapped whip,
and, most spectacular of all, a golden
pectoral, or breastplate.
The pectoral weighs 1,150 gram¬
mes. Its crescent-shaped surface is
divided into three bands by broad
elegant twisted cords of gold.
In the centre of the lowest band
three scenes show a horse being
attacked and pulled down by griffins.
Beyond them are depicted the com¬
bats of a wild boar and a deer with a
leopard and a lion, and at each end
of this band a hound chases after a
hare. In front of each hare two
grasshoppers face each othereternal
symbols of peace and tranquility.
The middle band is decorated with
plant motifs and among the wonder¬
fully interwoven flowers, shoots,
palmleaves, rosettes and leaves, five
lifelike figures of birds evoke the
atmosphere of a quiet sunny morning.
Linked with the lower band into a
single picture, the middle band forms
a kind of interlude between the large-
scale sculptural figures on the lower
and upper bands and gives the whole
work its unity as a great symphonic
poem about Scythian life and ideas.
In the upper band, four Scythians
go about their peaceful tasks sur¬
rounded by domestic animals. In
the centre two men, stripped to the
waist, their quivers and bows close
at hand, are sewing a sheepskin
tunic. To the left and right of them
a cow and a mare suckle their young
and further on two youths are milk¬
ing ewes. Birds in flight complete
the composition, communicating an
impression of the infinity of the world.
With its perfect proportions and the
outstanding beauty and naturalness
of its movements, each figure is a
sculptural masterpiece. An extra¬
ordinary composition, the work as a
whole undoubtedly has a complex
symbolic meaning. But, quite apart
from its true significance, it seems
clear that in this work the artist was
striving, directly or indirectly, to
convey a philosophical picture of his
world, with all its aspirations and its
dreams.
For the first time, we see on a
ritual royal object neither battle '
scenes nor noble warriors, but a vistas
of earthly life in all its harmony. f

Such a find was unprecedented in
the field of Scythian studies. It
reflected, as a drop of dew does the
sun, the full brilliance and radiance
of rpyal Scythian gold, much more of
which has been found at Tolstaya
Mogila than in Kul Oba, previously
the richest Scythian tomb ever
excavated.
Yet the importance of these finds
lies not in the gold, butin the priceless
historical-revelations that come from
every object in the Tolstaya tomb
and the imperishable artistic value
of its most exquisite works.

DEER-STALKING LIONS. Each end of this solid gold neck-ring is decorated
with seven lions stalking a deer whose hindquarters merge
into the decorative pattern on the neck-ring. This ornament belonged
to a Scythian noblewoman buried 2,300 years ago with all her jewels.
It came to light in 1971 in the same tomb as the magnificent pectoral
shown on page 19. The tomb was robbed but both objects were missed
by the plunderers.

of a stylized griffin may have surmounted a staff,

Discovered in 1971, it dates from the 4th century B.C.
and is only 5 cms. high.
WELL-TRAVELLED BOAR. This gold boar with silver tusks
may have been the base of a wine-cup. The wild boar
was a cult animal for the Celts and this work
was probably made by a Celtic craftsman in Central Europe
in the 4th century B.C. Its discovery in the Ukraine
is evidence of the trade links that existed in ancient times
between the Scythian world and its Western neighbours.
Unearthed in 1970, the boar is 5 cms. long
and weighs less than 20 grammes.

SCYTHIAN PANOPLY. Carved in limestone 2,500 years ago, this statue is
the full-length portrayal of a Scythian warrior in helmet and armour (see also
box page 13). From his belt hang the typical short Scythian sword (the akinakes)
a quiver for bow and arrows (the gorytus), a battle-axe and a sheathed dagger.
He is wearing a neck-ring and in his right hand he grips to his breast a rhyton,
a horn-shaped drinking cup. The 2-metre-high statue may originally have
topped a burial mound. It was found near the Black Sea in 1975 by
archaeologists of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine.

of the chase
A 2,400-year-old Scythian or¬
nament of singular beauty
and originality was recently
unearthed in the Ukraine (the first
photo of this, work ever published
appears on the centre colour pages of
this issue).
The ornament, a horse's gold bridle
piece, came to light when the undis¬
turbed grave of a man and two horses
was uncovered at the end of a corri¬
dor. The discovery was made by
two specialists in the archaeology of
Early Iron Age cultures, I. P. Savovsky
and Yu. V. Boltrik, who were directing
excavations at the village of Giunovko
in the Kamenskoye-Dnieper district
of the Zaporozhye region.
A man of about 25 lay by the wall
of the passageway. The small num¬
ber and modest nature of the objects
near him (a gold ear-ring, an iron bra¬
celet, glass beads and a bunch of
arrows) showed his subordinate po¬
sition in society: he was most pro¬
bably a groom. The horse buried by
the opposite wall was also modestly
decorated: the archaeologists found
an iron bit and the fastenings of a
bridle.
In comparison, the decoration of
the second horse, lying in the middle,
was striking in its magnificence. It
consisted of a bridle frontlet in the
form of a lion, two cheekplates show¬
ing a lion pulling down a deer, four
phaleras, or discs with running spirals,
and two plaques without decoration.
All the objects were of gilded silver.
The horse's head was crowned
with a flat top-piece. This was
painted blue, with a leather base, and
had a delicate segment-shaped gold
plaque (33 cm by 20 cm) stuck to it.
The decoration on this "diadem for
a horse" is new for Scythian art. A
woman rider is firing arrows at a stag
under a tree which is crowned by two
enormous stylized flowers with red-
coloured outer petals.
Plant shoots are visible under the
feet of the horse and the stag, and
plant motifs dominate the scene.
The antlers of the stag are intertwined
with the branches of the tree and a
wide border of plant ornamentation i

from themframes the perimeter of
the ornament. The top-piece is a
miniature decorative panel in which
the colourful effect is achieved by a
combined use of gold, blue and red.
The skilled craftsmanship has given
the work an appearance of delicate
gold lace.
The realism of the details in the
costume of the horsewoman and her
pose should not be allowed toobscure
the mythological nature of the subject
as a whole. The theme of the death
of a stag is repeated three times in
the decoration of the buried horse.
On the cheekplates the stag is shown
being eaten by a lion, on the gold discs
it is being pulled down by a griffin,
and in the top-piece it is being killed
by a human.
The hunt takes place in a sacred
grove in which trees and plants are
highly stylized, and the whole recalls
the legend of the virgin huntress of
the GreeksArtemis. This relates
how the hunter Actaeon strayed by
mistake into the sacred forest of the
goddess in the valley of Cithaeron,
where he caught sight of her bathing.
As a punishment, Artemis turned
Actaeon into a stag, which then
became itself the prey of hunters.
The image of the divine huntress
would naturally attract the Scythians,
whose religion, as Herodotus tells us,
underwent an intensive process of
anthropomorphisation of divinities
during the 5th and 4th centuries
B.C. But the discovery of this hunt¬
ing scene is still too recent for defi¬
nitive conclusions to be drawn about
its exact significance.

PAZYRYK
a nomad way of life
"deep-frozen" for 25 centuries
in Siberian mountain tombs
by Manya
P. Zavitukhina
MARIYA PAVLOVNA ZAVITUKHINA,
Soviet archaeologist, is executive secretary
of the Department of History of Prehistoric
Cultures and curator of Siberian antiquities
at the State Hermitage Museum (Leningrad).
For many years she has directed excavations
of monuments from the Scythian period
in the Krasnoyarsk region and is the author
of many studies on Siberian archaeology.
Colour page opposite:
In the tombs of Pazyryk (Siberia)
archaeologists have discovered
clothing, wall hangings and carpets
perfectly preserved for over
2,000 years beneath the frozen earth.
Above left, detail of a felt saddle
cover from Pazyryk; the entire cover
is shown in lower photo. Its design,
in coloured felt appliqué outlined
with cords, shows a mountain goat
attacked by a griffin; its tassels are
fringed with horsehair and fur.
Saddle covers cushioned the riders'
thighs and were often embellished
with brightly coloured animal forms
or animal combats.
THE High Altai in Siberia is
severe, majestic country.
Over its steppes and moun¬
tain pastures, in the middle
of the last millennium B.C., roamed
the nomadic tribes which scholars
have associated with the gold-guard¬
ing griffins of legend. Following
their vast herds of cattle and horses,
they left behind them, in the upland
hollows, innumerable cairn-covered
barrows known as kurgans or burial-
mounds.
In 1 929, two scholars from Lenin¬
grad, S.I. Rudenko and M.P. Gryaznov,
began excavations in an ancient burial
ground in a place called Pazyryk,
1.600 metres above sea-level in the
remote Ulagan Valley, in Siberia.
The explorations of the first kurgan,
which proved to be frozen solid and
to contain goods which would nor¬
mally be called "perishable", aroused
unprecedented interest.
Rudenko's return in 1947-1949, at
the head of an expedition which
investigated four other frozen barrows,
produced sensational results. When
the "refrigerated" tombs yielded up
carpets, clothing and footwear, a
ceremonial chariot, the mummified
bodies of men and women, horses in
rich trappings, utensils of all kinds,
musical instruments and other objects
of them almost 2,500 years old
the little known name of Pazyryk be¬
came world famous.
The hollows where the barrows are
situated are outside the area in which
the ground is permanently frozen, but
the climate of the High Altai, with its
low mean annual temperatures, its
long and almost snow-free winters
and its short summers, when the
nights are still cold, led to the forma¬
tion of merzlota, or permafrost, under
the cairns themselves. Their stones
protected the earth from heat in the
summer, and permitted refrigeration
to a depth of seven metres, where the
temperature never rose above freezing
point. Water turned into ice as it
filtered into the tombs, whose con¬
tents, thus "deep-frozen", . were in
ideal conditions of preservation.
The archaeologists were faced with
an unusual problem. In order to see
inside the burial places, they had to
lay aside their trowels, knives and
brushes, and pour in vast quantities
of hot water to melt the ice.
The Altaians organized excep¬
tionally splendid burials, following
customs and rituals similar to those of
their kindred people the Scythians.
At the bottom of a deep and roomy
hole, they built a log-lined chamber
with walls and ceiling of double
thickness. On the floor they laid the
coffins which would receive the em¬
balmed bodies of the dead. They
decorated the walls of the tomb with
felt hangings, and furnished it with
the personal possessions of the men
and women they were burying, adding
tableware, food and drink.
Outside the burial chamber they
placed richly caparisoned horses,
killed on the day of the funeral. They
even left behind them some of the
tools used in preparing the tomb:
wooden shovels, picks and mallets, as
well as trolleys and ladders. Then
they carefully covered over the tomb
with layers of birch bark and the fo¬
liage of the "smoky tea" shrub, and
roofed it up to ground level with
larch logs. They heaped soil on the
top and then, finally, raised a cairn of
stones over the mound.
Objects found in the tombs and
data from radiocarbon analysis, indi¬
cate that these burial mounds were
constructed in the fifth or fourth
centuries B.C.
The excellent pastures and almost
snow-free winters provided the Al¬
taian nomads with year-round grazing
for their herds of horses and for the
herds of cattle, sheep and goats
which furnished all their everyday
requirementsfood, clothes and
shelter.
For these nomadic peoples, the
horse was the principal means of lo¬
comotion. In addition to their small,
locally-bred draught-horses, they
possessed highly-prized and swift-
footed thoroughbred fliers, gold and
chestnut in colouring, of Central Asian
origin. They even took these riding-
horses with them into the grave.

TREASURES SAVED BY FROST AND LOOTERS
Rich stores of normally perishable objects, yielding priceless information
about the steppe nomads, have been found almost perfectly
preserved in the extraordinary frozen tombs of the Altai mountains in
Siberia (6th-4th centuries B.C.). Below, cross-section of an Altai
tomb in the highland valley of Pazyryk, where graves were first excavated
by Soviet archaeologists in 1929. Tomb chamber shown, walled
and roofed with logs, was at bottom of a pit 5 metres deep.- At ground
level earth from the pit was formed into a low mound topped by piles
of boulders (see view of Pazyryk tombs in photo above). Cold winter air
settled between the stones and eventually a lens-shaped section of
ground around the burial chamber became perpetually frozen. Every
human burial chamber at Pazyryk was looted by robbers who dug down and
chopped through the logs (note disturbed v-shaped area of rocks
and soil in cross-section). Water seeped through the opening and froze,
preserving for all time the bodies of chieftains, their women, horses
and possessions of fur, fabric, leather and wood, left behind by
the looters. Drawing at bottom shows a Pazyryk horse burial, including
trappings and wheels and frame of a 4-horse carriage.

know how the ancient Altaians sad¬
dled up. The saddle itself consisted
of two soft felt cushions, stuffed with
deer hair and secured by breast- and
crupper-straps which prevented it
from sliding forwards or backwards.
Stirrups were still unknown; they
were not to come into use for another
thousand years. The bridle was
formed by a headstall strap attached
to the bit, with side-straps, a throat-
lash and a single noseband strap.
The nomads of the Altai probably
lived in light, portable tents, or yurty,
in covered wagons when they were
on the move andif the skill with
which they built their burial chambers
is a guidein log houses. They
used wooden and earthenware
vessels, as well as leather pouches
and flasks.
Their clothing consisted of skirts
woven from kendyr or hemp fibres,
caftans of fur or felt, and patchwork
breeches made of soft, pliable leather.
Their footwear consisted of felt
stockings and high leather boots
with soft soles. This costume was
completed by a head-dress in the
form of a tall cap with ear-flaps, and
a silver-buckled leather belt.
Women's clothing included coats
of squirrel skin, fur inwards, with
narrow, decorative sleeves, and short,
fur-lined bootees, also with soft soles.
The nomads went to war with
bronze battle-axes, iron daggers and
bows and arrows, sheltering behind
shields made from whittled sticks
pleated through thin leather.
The ancient Altaians lived together
in clans or tribes, with distinct classes
of chieftains and property-owning
nobles. The patriarch, who bore the
double responsibility of stock-breeder
and warrior, played a leading role in
the family unit, although the matriarch
was also held in high esteem. Concu¬
bines figured among the womenfolk,
but probably only at the upper, pro¬
perty-owning levels of society, where
custom demanded that the favourite,
after the death of her lord and master,
be strangled so that she might follow
him beyond the grave.
Although the people of the High
Altai lived in out-of-the-way places,
far from the ancient centres of civili¬
zation, many of the objects found in
their burial mounds reveal a broad
network of trade and relations with
other peoples, from whom they
acquired precious goods: carpets,
richly-woven textiles and ornaments,
and the well-bred Central Asian riding-
horses which they prized above all
else.
The Altaians probably offered
cattle and horses from their own
herds, as well as furs, gold and sil¬
ver, in exchange for these goods.
Valuable pile carpets and woollen
cloth of a distinctive style from Iran
found their way through Central
Asia to the Altai, whose inhabitants
also obtained from their Eastern
neighbours embroidered silks which

FABULOUS BESTIARIES
ON TAPESTRY AND SADDLE
Many elegant and richly worked textiles,
some imported from faraway Iran and China,
were found in the Pazyryk tombs, their
colours still unfaded. Tapestries and felt
hangings which adorned the tents of the
horsemen of the steppes were dyed in
vivid reds, blues, yellows and greens and
often covered with elaborate designs
depicting men and real or mythical creatures.
A prancing winged and antlered figure,
half-lion, half-human, decorates this
fragment of a felt wall-hanging from
Pazyryk (1). Horses had been decked out
with magnificent finery before being buried
with their masters. Felt saddle covers were
lavishly decorated with ornaments, mostly
depicting exuberant scenes of animal
combat. (See also colour photos page 30.)
Drawings below show four animal motifs
embellishing Pazyryk saddle covers; the
silhouettes were all cut from leather, partly
coloured and covered with gold leaf or
tinfoil: (2) Lion with massive head and
fanged open jaws; (3) Eagle-griffin pecks
fiercely into the neck of a lion-griffin; (4) A
griffin grips an elk in its talons; (5) Mountain
ram with tiger tearing at its throat has
collapsed onto its forelegs with its crupper
twisted round. (See also pages 34 and 35.)
Its body is slashed with stops, commas
and half-horseshoes, a technique vividly
used by the Altai artists to indicate the
principal muscles and ribs.

One of the most exciting and puzzling
discoveries made at Pazyryk was that
of the embalmed body of an elderly
chieftain who had been covered in
intricate tattooing long before his death,
A mass of real and imaginary beasts
pouncing, galloping,
prancing and kickingtumble
helter-skelter down both arms and
cover parts of one leg, chest and back.
The designs, preserved by the freezing
temperature, were formed by first
pricking the skin and then rubbing soot
in the perforations. On this double page
we show drawings of nine cavorting
creatures on the tattooed man and a
photo (4) of an enlarged detail from
his right arm, depicting a prancing
deer with an eagle's beak and long
antlers that turn into bird heads.
Numbers on drawing 11, a front view
of the chieftain, indicate the position
of some of the creatures on his body.
Running from his left breast to his
shoulder is a griffin, its curling tail
tipped by the head of a bird or
snake (1). A fish (10) and a row of
mountain sheep run up one leg.
Fantastic procession winding up right
arm from hand to shoulder includes
a donkey (5), a winged monster with
a feline body (6), a carnivore with
gaping fanged jaws (9) and a horned
mountain ram (7). Notice the
extraordinary way in which the ram's
hindquarters are twisted right round
like those of fantastic beast (3) on
back of right arm. Animals were
often depicted in this way by Altai
artists, usually when being attacked
by stronger beasts. Among the motifs
on the left arm are an animal with
tucked-in forelegs, possibly a mountain
ram (2) and a fabulous beast combining
features of deer, eagle and feline
carnivore (8). What was the purpose
of this tattooing? In his book
Frozen Tombs of Siberia, Sergei I.
Rudenko, the Soviet archaeologist
who excavated the Pazyryk burial
mounds, suggests that it may have
"signified noble birth or was a mark of
manhood or both", while the whirling
monsters "had some magic significance
not yet understood". The tattooed
chieftain remains an enigmatic figure.

must have been considered price¬
less, even in China.
Amid all the treasures unearthed
at Pazyryk pride of place must go to
a multicoloured pile carpet, woven
by a special knotted technique,
whose almost square surface (ap¬
proximately 2 m. by 2 m.) depicts
horses and riders, grazing deer,
griffins and stylized vegetation.
This carpet, the oldest of its kind in
the world, is a tribute to the work¬
manship of its Iranian weavers.
Close contacts with their neigh¬
bours led the nomads of the High
Altai into mixed marriages, and
although the physical features of
the men and women buried in the
tombs are mainly European, traces
of Indo-European and Mongoloid
may also be detected. The Altaians,
like the Scythians, are presumed to
have spoken a number of different
dialects of Iranian type.
The art of the ancient tribes of
the High Altai is astonishing in its
abundance and unique in its variety.
It constitutes an excellent corrective
to the one-sided notion that
Scythian art was a matter merely
of artifacts fashioned from metal,
bone or clay.
In their choice of images and
subjects, the Altaian artists followed
the so-called "animal style" of
Scythian art. The outstanding qua-
Jity of the many everyday articles
found in their tombs, of their clothes
and of the trappings of their horses,
indicates that artistic creation mat¬
tered to the nomads to an unusual
degree, and that they spent their
whole lives surrounded by aestheti
cally pleasing objects.
Art was indeed in the people's
blood. And the images of animals
and birds, whether wild or domesti¬
cated, real or fantastic, which
figured in their decorations were
more than brightly coloured orna¬
ments. They revealed the spirit of
the people, their beliefs, the way
they looked at things.
In their travels abroad, the ancient
Altaians absorbed what was best in
their neighbours' art, and then
added their own local colour and
interpretations. Thus, they found
place in their own creations for
griffins and sphinxes borrowed from
Western Asia, and for patterns of
lotus flowers, ornamental palm-trees'
and geometrical designs whose
origins were in the countries of
the near East and in Egypt.
It is possible that the artistic
leanings of the people of the High
Altai were stimulated by the abun¬
dance of materials which lay close
at hand. Stock-raising provided
them with a source of excellent
felt. They fashioned high-quality
leathers and furs. Their forests pro¬
duced the cedar-wood and larch
from which the finest carvings could
be made, while the plant world
placed henna, indigo and madder at
their disposal, and the ground under
their feet yielded ochre, colcothar
and cinnabar as mineral dyes, as
well as virtually limitless quantities
of gold, silver and other metals, which
they used widely for decorative pur¬
poses.
As we have seen the riding-horse
was the subject of lavish attentions.
Indeed, decked out in ceremonial
trappings, it must have been a fan¬
tastic sight. Its head was enclosed
in a decorated leather mask; its
bridle had carved wooden cheek-
pieces, pasted over with gold leaf.
The felt saddle-cushions and the
shabrack (saddle-cover) were trim¬
med with multi-coloured appliqué
work, while leather covers and
sheaths were stitched to the horse's
mane and tail.
The clothing and footwear of
the Altaians were decorated with
patches of coloured felt, fur and
leather, and embroidered with pat¬
terns in wool or sinew threads bound
round with strips of tinfoil. Their felt
carpets and wall-hangings, also exe¬
cuted in appliqué work, were colour¬
ful masterpieces, decorating the walls
and floors of their mobile homes, and
even the wooden legs of their low,
collapsible tables were carved in the
shape of tigers.
Colours also figured in the leather
and fur pouches in which they stored
cheese and other produce, and in
their purses containing hempseeds
and imported coriander seeds. Their
arrow-shafts and shields were painted,
too. One may well ask whether the
Altaians had a single object un¬
touched by the hand of an artist.
_Among their images, the favour¬
ites were beasts of prey (tigers and
wolves), and other wild animals (elk,
deer and mountain goats and rams),
whose lively and realistic portraits
reveal the Altaians' great familiarity
with their habits and movements.
But no less impressive are the ima¬
ginary creatures, devised out of

GAGGLE OF GRIFFINS
A griffin slaying a deer is a theme
widely used by the nomad artists
of the steppes (see back cover).
Example from Pazyryk at far
left was carved in wood in the 5th
century B.C. and is 35 cms
high. It shows an abbreviated
form of the subject, with the head
of each animal symbolizing the
entire beast. The comb, ears and
wings of the griffin are made
from thick leather, as also are the
ears and antlers of the deer.
Points of antlers consist of cocks'
heads on long necks. Left, two
griffins coil round a frontal piece from
a horse's bridle decoration found
in a tomb at Tuekta in the Altai
mountains. Right, astonishingly
well-preserved leather griffin's
head with curving beak and large
ears and antlers was unearthed

elements of living animals and
birdsthe griffins and winged tigers,
to which the Altaians returned more
frequently than the Scythians.
The skills which the Altaian artists
applied in so many creative ways
have survived until today, transmit¬
ted by succeeding generations from
the mainspring of an art which was
truly popular and never the jealously
guarded secret of a few masters.
The Altaian artist always excelled
in composition. With admirable
ease and virtuosity, the sculptors
in wood, bone and horn fitted their
subjects into the shape of the object
they were decorating, lengthening or
shortening the body of the animal,
enlarging its head, bending its
fore- and hind- quarters into curves.
The ancient Altaian sculptors passed
unconcernedly from one technique
to another, from shallow relief to
excised designs, and then to sculp¬
ture in the round.
An outstanding feature of Altaian
art is the manner in which the exe¬
cution of a single piece of work
involved all these techniques of
sculpture, as well as the use of
different materials, in which an
object could be simultaneously pain¬
ted in bright colours and pasted
over with strips of gold, tinfoil or
silver.
This complexity is particularly
evident in a carved wooden crest,
representing a griffin holding a
deer's head in its beak (see back
cover) while figures made of soft ma¬
terials, such as leather and felt, are
particularly well represented by the
swans, composed of pieces of col¬
oured felt, which may have adorn¬
ed the canopy of a burial carriage (see
page 47).
Altaian art often contains scenes
in which beasts of prey and griffins
are falling upon deer, elk, and moun¬
tain rams and goats. These ¡mages
possibly reflect a period when the
pastoral tribes were at war with
each other. This age of men in
arms produced its breeds of heroes,
in whose honour epic tales and
songs must have been composed.
It is not surprising, therefore, that
the burial chambers also contained
musical instruments, in the form of
multi-stringed harps and drums.
The excavation of the frozen
tombs of the High Altai revealed the
ancient, original culture of the Altai
nomads, which doubtless had a great
influence on Scythian art as a whole.
Now, the works of the Altaian masters
have found another resting-place,
among the collected treasures of
world art.

HORSES
FOR THE HEREAFTER
by Mikhail P. Gryaznov
FOR many centuries, the immense
expanse of the steppes from
the river Danube to the Great
Wall of China formed a single vast
cultural-historical region. The nu¬
merous tribes of this region, who
lived in constant contact with each
other, differed in their historical past,
as well as in their ethnographic
heritage, but created for themselves
a culture which was uniform in its
general outlines.
This broad uniformity resulted from
the fact that the culture had taken
shape through a series of identical
stages of development, which unfol¬
ded simultaneously across the whole
belt of the steppes. This process
began in the Aeneolithic period, the
time of transition from the Stone
Age to the era of metals. In the
steppes of Eurasia this transition
coincided with that from the system
of acquisitive economy (hunting,
fishing and food-gathering) to the
productive economy, which in this
case centred on cattle-breeding.
The uniformity in the historical
development of all. the steppe tribes
became particularly evident in the
time of the Scythians, when the
population of the steppes went over
to the nomadic way of life, became
highly mobile and developed under
conditions of extensive inter-tribal
cultural exchanges.
In recent years, terms such as
"cultures of Scytho-Siberian type"
and "the Scytho-Siberian animal
style" have begun to be used more
and more frequently. However,
there has still been very little study
of the Asian part of the Scytho-
Siberian cultural world. Specialists
in Scythian history tend to focus
their attention pn the monuments of
the northern Black Sea area and the
MIKHAIL PETROVICH GRYAZNOV,
member of the Archaeological Institute of
the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in
Leningrad, has directed excavations of the
tomb-complex of Arzhan (Autonomous Soviet
Republic of Tuva) and of tombs at Pazyryk
in the Altai mountains (Siberia). Professor
of Siberian archaeology at the university of
Leningrad, he is the author of many published
works including a study on the first burial
mound excavated at Pazyryk.
problems of the origin of those tribes
which may properly be called
Scythian. Discussion centres on
the question of the origin of the
Scythians and the composition of
the Scythian animal style.
Until recently, the only undisputed
premise in these arguments was that
Scythian culture and art came into
being in the 7th century B.C. and
that the attainments of Scythian
culture with its presumed pre-Asiatic
sources slowly spread to the East in
somewhat modified forms.
However, it is also true to say that
scholars have for long been study¬
ing some remarkable monuments
of the culture of the early nomads
of Siberia, magnificent specimens of
their original art. Among these are
the amazing gold collection of
Peter I, the Pazyryk kurgans (burial
mounds) in the Altai (see page 31),
and the bronze objects and megalithic
enclosures of the kurgans of the
Tagar culture on the river Yenisey.
During the last 20 years, monu¬
ments of the early Scythian period
have been discovered in Central
and Southern Kazakhstan, as well as
in the western foothills of the Altai
and in Tuva. It has become clear
that cultures of Scythian type came
into being in the East no later than
in Scythia itself. They were created
and flourished at the same time and
parallel with that culture which was
properly Scythian.
Many Scythian specialists were
surprised by the discovery in 1971,
at different points in the Scytho-
Siberian lands, of three remarkable
monumentsthe royal kurgan of
Ptichata Mogila in Bulgaria, near
the town of Varna, two rich burials in
the Vysokaya Mogila on the Dnieper
and the royal kurgan of Arzhan
in the Tuva Autonomous Soviet Repu¬
blic. All of these are dated to the
8th-7th centuries B.C., a time which
precedes the early Scythian period,
and the first two monuments are
accepted by the majority of scholars
as being pre-Scythian or Cimmerian
in culture.
Unlike them, the kurgan of Arzhan
belongs to the fully developed cul¬
ture of Scytho-Siberian type. It too,
however, belongs not to its "early
Scythian" stage, but to another,
even earlier one. In order to under¬
stand the exceptional significance
of these monuments in explaining
the origin and composition of cul¬
tures of the Scytho-Siberian type,
we need to look at the kurgan of
Arzhan in somewhat greater detail.

Nomad chieftains were often buried
with their horsesin some cases
scores of them, as in the great
8th- 7th-century B.C. tomb-complex
at Arzhan in the Sayan mountains
(Autonomous Soviet Republic of Tuva).
Opposite page: remains of Arzhan's
vast circular wooden structure,
120 metres in diameter. Left, plan of
Arzhan showing the honeycomb-like
network of its chambers. Tiny horse-
figures indicate where horses were
buriedup to 30 in each chamber.
In the central chamber the nomad
chieftain and his queen were buried
with magnificent ceremony. No less
than 6,000 trees were felled to build
the tomb and over 10,000 persons
are thought to have attended
the funeral. Below left, bronze plaque
of a coiled wild beast by a nomad
artist. Unearthed at Arzhan it is
one of the biggest of its kind
ever found.
Arzhan is a vast stone tomb, the
biggest in the Sayan Mountains
120 metres in diameter. Under its
stone mound, a unique wooden
structure of enormous dimensions
has been splendidly preserved. A
large square wooden framework,
with an area of more than 65 square
metres, is placed directly on the
ground. Seventy other such frame¬
works are arranged around it in
radial lines and circles. These toge¬
ther form a round wooden platform,
about three metres high, which were
covered by a ceiling.
Excavations of the kurgan under
my direction went on for four years.
Although the monument had been
more than once ransacked and
plundered even in very ancient times,
we discovered a large number of
objects and were able to recreate a
fairly detailed picture of the magni¬
ficent royal funeral.
Thousands of people gathered at
the place of burial in the month of
September. In seven to eight days
they felled more than 6,000 tree-
trunks and used them to build the
huge multi-chambered platform.
The central chamber contained, on
a soft litter made of horses' manes
and tails, a small framework with
double walls and a ceiling, in which
the bodies of the king and his queen
were placed in separate sarcophagi
made of hollowed logs. They were
dressed in rich clothing made of
multicoloured imported fabrics and
costly furs (sable and others).
The tomb was plundered. Vir¬
tually nothing of importance has
remained, out of what must have
been a mass of valuable ornaments:
only one small golden plaque and
pieces of golden leaves, some tur¬
quoise beads and a bead necklace,
and 20 small turquoise discs, which
were probably the inlay of massive
golden plaques depicting animals.
These plaques were stolen by thei
grave-robbers. I

On three sides around the royal
framework were placed eight hol¬
lowed logs in which were buried im¬
portant personages who accompanied
the king. All except one were old
or indeed very old, and all were dres¬
sed in rich fur or woollen clothes.
Only in some of the logs had objects
been preserved: these included orna¬
ments of gold and turquoise, bronze
arrows, a dagger and some other
items. Another five similar person¬
ages were buried in .neighbouring
chambers.
On the fourth side of the royal
framework were stacked six saddle
horses. Of their rich and magni¬
ficent harness there remain a few
ornaments from the bridle and
saddle straps, some gold and silver,
and some made of coloured stone
or boar tusks. These horses were
obviously the personal property of
the king.
One must suppose that numerous
representative groups of nomads
from all the tribes subject to the
kingthose who peopled the moun¬
tainous steppes of what is now
Tuvagathered for his funeral. They
arrived with gifts which befitted the
occasion. In seven chambers, posi¬
tioned to the east of the central one,
they buried 138 horses30 saddle
horses in each of three chambers,
15 horses in each of three other
chambers and three horses in the
last one.
The horses in each chamber all
came from the same tribe. All of
them were buried with their bridles
and saddles. All were old stallions.
There are few harness ornaments,
but there are wonderful examples of
the Scytho-Siberian animal style
artan enormous bronze figure of
a beast of prey rolled into the form of
a ring, and an ivory head of a
bridled horse.
We may also take it that delega¬
tions from neighbouring countries
took part in the royal funeral. They
placed their gifts to the deceased in
six chambers, positioned to the
north and north-east of the central
chamber. In each of these chambers
from two to ten horses were buried.
The bridle plates of each group of
horses belong to a particular type,
and differ from the harness dress of
all the other groups; the ornaments
of the bridles are also different.
There are five remarkable bronze
top-pieces (perhaps from battle stan¬
dards), with monumental figures of
mountain rams on them.
In one case, .the horses were
accompanied by two distinguished
elders, buried beside them in hol¬
lowed logs. They had come, obviously -
from some distance, in order to fol¬
low the king, who was honoured
not only in his own country, but
also beyond its borders. The par¬
ticipation of foreign representatives
in the funerals of great nomad
leaders probably occurred quite fre¬
quently in the past.
An ancient Turkic epitaph, for
example, informs us that at the
funeral of the first Turkic kagan or
leader, there gathered "weeping
and groaning people" from all the
ends of the earth, including some
from tribes and peoples not subject
to the Turks, i.e. from the coasts of
the Pacific, the Siberian taiga and
Central Asia. Even "Avars" and
"Rum", envoys from the Black Sea
steppes and from faraway Byzan¬
tium, are said to have been present.
One can judge the numbers of
participants in the funeral by the
remains of the funeral feast. Around
the kurgan of Arzhan the ruins of
small round stone enclosures stand
in a semi-circle. There are more
than 300 of them. In the ruins of
each were found the bones of a
horse, but only fragments of the
skull and bones of the lower part of
the legs.
These are evidently remains of the
sacrificial horses, placed on the site
of the funeral celebrations after
the horses' flesh had been eaten
and the funeral feast had finished.
Such a ritual was widespread among
the nomads from the most ancient
times onwards. If one horse was
eaten on the site of each enclosure,
the total number of those present
at the funeral feast must have
exceeded 10,000.
The tomb of Arzhan is clear evi¬
dence that the cultures of the so-
called early Scythian period were
preceded by cultures of an already
fully formed Scytho-Siberian type.
Some scholars may hesitate to attribute
such monuments in the Black Seat
steppes to an early stage of Scythian'
culture, but there is no doubt about
the monuments of the Sayano-Altai
region in this regard. Other monu¬
ments of this period, of a fully Scy¬
tho-Siberian type, are also known
in the Sayano-Altai region. Of
these, the most interesting by far
are the so-called deer stones.
A few deer stones were discovered
in the 19th century not far from
Arzhan. We also found a fragment
of such a stone in the Arzhan tomb
on the ceiling of one of its cham¬
bers. The deer stones have the
appearance of a round or rectan¬
gular pillar or a slab-shape,d stone,
representing a warrior with his
weapons in conventionalized form.
They range in height from half a
metre to three metres.
The lower part of the stone is
"belted" with a thong, which has a
bow, a dagger, a hatchet and other
weapons suspended from it. At the
top, where the face of the warrior
should be, there are usually three
small parallel oblique lines. On the
sides are ear-rings and lower down
a necklace or pendant. On the
smooth surface of the stone the
figures of a noble deer and some¬
times other animals are often repre¬
sented. Thus the name of deer
stone, although very often there are
Drawing shows design on the
four sides of a "deer stone" (c. 8th
century B.C.) unearthed in the
Mongolian steppe. Although named
from the figures of deer inscribed on
them, such stones are in fact stylized
portrayals of nomad warriors.
This one wears a neck-ring and
ear-rings. Weapons, including a
dagger and a hatchet, hang from
his belt and deer run slantwise round
his body. Many such stones, ranging
in height from half a metre to 3 metres,
have been found in Mongolia, the
Tuva Autonomous Republic of the
U.S.S.R. and, in a slightly different
form, in the Urals.
no representations of deer on the
stone.
Most deer stones have been found
in the steppes of Mongolia, and also
many in Tuva. They have also been
unearthed in the adjoining lands
beyond Lake Baikal and in the moun¬
tainous Altai. Further west, only
isolated examples occur as far as the
southern Urals. In the Urals, these
stone representations of a warrior
are still more conventionalthe flat
side of the stone bears representa¬
tions of only a hatchet and a dagger,
with sometimes a belt.
It is true that the steles of the
Northern Caucasus are very close
in type to deer stones, but they
represent a somewhat individual
variant of conventional warrior repre¬
sentations. Yet another variant of
such sculptures existed further to the
west. One of these has been found
in Romania, and another in Bulgaria
in the mound of the Ptichata Mogila
kurgan mentioned above.
The monumental sculpture of the
Asian and Black Sea steppes, inclu¬
ding its conventional image of the
warrior, emerged and developed at
the very beginning of the formation
of the early Scytho-Siberian nomad
culture. The consecutive stages in
the evolution of this warrior image

followed similar lines across the wide
expanse of the steppes. Similarly,
the Scytho-Siberian animal style,
despite all its variety, developed
uniformly across the vast territory
stretching from the Danube to the
Great Wall of China.
Monuments known to belong to
the initial period of Scythian culture
are still very few in number in the
steppes both of Asia and the Black
Sea area. It is still impossible, on
the basis of the finds in the Arzhan
tomb and some less significant monu¬
ments of the Altai, to give a full
picture of the origin and composition
of the Scytho-Siberian type cultures,
altough some important conclusions
can now be drawn.
It can no longer be said that the
Scytho-Siberian cultures formed in
the 7th century B.C. or later spread
from a single centre in different di¬
rections, including the East. Secon¬
dly, it is clear that the determining
factor in the development of the
steppe population at that time was
the transition to a new economy
based on nomadic cattle-breeding.
This stimulated the development of
new farming methods and cultural
forms.
It is difficult to be precise about
the movements and practices of par¬
ticular tribes, but it is clear that from
the 8th century B.C. onwards, similar
cultures of Scytho-Siberian type
emerged and developed simul¬
taneously. Extensive inter-tribal ex¬
changes which occurred both peace¬
fully and by means of wars and
plundering raids meant that the cul¬
tural acquisitions of one tribe became
widely distributed among the other
tribes.
The ancient tribes of the Asian
steppes were obviously creators and
constructors of cultures of Scytho-
Siberian type to as great an extent
as their contemporaries, the Scy¬
thians. It is even possible that the
contribution which Asian tribes such
as the Altaians and Tuvinians made
to the formation of Scytho-Siberian
art and culture was sometimes more
significant than that made by the
Scythians themselves.
Indeed one might well question
whether European Scythia was, as
many people have hitherto believed,
a centre or focus of the Scytho-
Siberian territory. After all, it was
situated on the far periphery of the
Scytho-Siberian territory and its
proximity to and close contacts with
Mediterranean civilization may to
some extent have repressed the
creative originality of the Scythians.

epic journeys
to a legendary land
by Grigory M. Bongard-Levin and Edvin A. Grantovsky
THE highly original culture of
the Scythians was influenced
by other peoples and in its
turn exerted a considerable influence
not only on classical societies and
the Ancient East, but, to an even
greater extent, on the vast tribal
world of Europe and northern Asia.
The Scythians possessed a vast
collection of epic tales in which their
spiritual culture was reflected. And
although the Scythian epic itself has
not come down to us, the search for
traces of it is quite feasible.
This search is made possible by
the ethnic links between the tribes
and peoples who lived in the south
Russian steppes during the Scythian
epoch and by the extensive contact
between the Scythians and their
neighbours. The latter ranged from
the population of the forest zone in
the north of Eurasia, whose descen¬
dants preserved their old folklore
traditions until recent times, to the
Hellenes (ancient Greeks) in the south,
with their rich ancient literature.
The Scythians also visited Greece.
Ancient writers and philosophers
often made use of the image of
Anacharsis, a Scythian whom the
Greeks included among the Seven
Wise Men of Antiquity.
The varied accounts of the Scy¬
thians found in ancient literature
make particular mention of epic
kings, heroes of Scythian legends,
the gods of the Scythian pantheon
and fantastical beings, such as the
one-eyed Arimaspean warriors and

In research at the Institute of Oriental Studies

the griffins which guarded a hoard
of gold. These accounts attested
the existence among the Scythians
of complex mythological and religious
conceptions and of a richly developed
epic.
Certain Scythian ¡mages worked
their way into the subjects of Hellenic
mythology, while some characters of
Greek myth share the attributes of
similar figures in Scythian mythology
and have "moved" from the places
they inhabited in more ancient Greek
tradition to the Scythian North.
It is fortunately possible to find
confirmation of the Scythian origin
of the motifs mentioned above among
the peoples of north-eastern Europe
and Siberia, far from the regions
of Scytho-Hellenic contact.
The folklore of these peoples fea¬
tures conceptions of one-eyed people
similar to the Arimaspeans, and
of winged monsters like the gold-
guarding griffins. These images
included some which are close to
the Greek and are endowed with
similar traits, such as the death-
bearing flying maidens, similar to the
gorgons, the winged daughters of a
Titan and also the cold wind whose
abode, like that of Boreas, god of
the north wind in later Greek tradi¬
tion, is a cave.
Can such coincidences be acci¬
dental when they occur in the legends
of countries as remote from each
other as Hellas and the forest regions
in the north of Eurasia, in legends
rooted in ancient literary traditions as
well as in those which have only
been recorded by modern folklorists
and anthropologists?
The Volga-Ural steppes, as far as
the Ural mountains, and the land
beyond the Urals were inhabited by
the Issedones and were known to the
Hellenes through the stories of the
Scythians and the Greek Aristeas,
who had been in Scythia in the 7th
century and had obviously reached
the Issedones.
The forests near the Ural moun¬
tains, evidently those along the Kama
and Volga rivers, were inhabited by
the Argippeans. Herodotus recounts
in this connexion that "those of the
Scythians who go to them (the Argip¬
peans) have to employ seven trans¬
lators and seven languages". The
existence in the Scythian epoch of a
trade route as far as the south Ural
region and the Volga-Kama forests
is confirmed by archaeological finds
in these regions of "imported" objects
from the northern Black Sea area.
The contacts between the Scy¬
thians and the forested Volga-Ural
regions from which the Finno-Ugric
languages spread explain the many
word borrowings from the steppe
peoples which have been found in
the Finno-Ugric languages, borrow¬
ings connected with both the mate¬
rial and spiritual culture and religious
and mythological conceptions.
These borrowings include the pas¬
sage of the name of the Wind God
("Vata") among the Eastern Indo-
Europeans and Scythians into the
name of the North Wind ("Vat") used
by the Ugrians beyond the Urals.
In addition, stories about "old man
North Wind" are very close to what
ancient literature tells us about
the "Boreas" who brought icy cold
into Scythia. Both of them find a
traveller, envelop him in their furious
breath and are capable of sweeping
him off his feet, carrying him away
or destroying him.
There can be no doubt that this
"Boreas", a character of purely Scy¬
thian mythology, was identified by
the Greeks with their North Wind,
the Boreas.
What do we learn from archaelo-
gical evidence? In the area round
the Kama River, for example, archaeo¬
logists have found cult figures of
creatures which are half-bird, half-
beast, with the head of a wolf or a
dog. Winged beasts or "griffins" are
also a frequent subject of Scythian
art, in which they usually combine
the features of an eagle and a lion
(or some other "feline" beast of prey).
However, several early Scythian
artifacts from the Black Sea area (of
the 6th-5th centuries B.C.) combine
the image of a bird-beast with the
features of a dog. And it is no acci¬
dent that Aeschylus (6th-5th centu¬
ries B.C.) in his Prometheus Bound
calls the bird-like griffins "silent" or
"unbarking" dogs (unlike the tradi¬
tional ancient description of griffins
as being like lions).
Ancient literature offers us signi¬
ficant information regarding the "geo¬
graphical" description of Scythia and
the lands beyond it if we base our¬
selves on the work of various authors k
of Antiquity. f

, From south to north lay regions
inhabited by peoples who really existed,
such as the Argippeans and the
Issedones. Beyond them, however,
and as far as the great northern
mountains, usually called the Ripas,
there lived fabulous tribes and fan¬
tastical creatures, including the now
familiar Arimaspeans, griffins and
others. Here also lay the abode of
"Boreas". These regions had been
abandoned by nature, were swathed
in darkness and covered in snow;
this was the kingdom of deepest
winter.
But even further north, in the
direction of the Ripas, the golden
peaks of which reached the sky, and
around which turned the sun and the
stars, on the mountainous heights
and the shore of the Northern Sea
beyond them lay a country with a
warm climate, free from the cold
winds and infinitely fertile.
In its woods and forests lived a
blessed and holy people, the "Hyper¬
boreans" of ancient tradition. The
sun here rose and set only once a
year: the day lasted six months, and
the night the six remaining months.
During the day the inhabitants sowed
crops in the morning, cut them in the
afternoon and in the evening gath¬
ered fruit from the trees.
Whose creation is this "geographi¬
cal" picture? That of the Greeks or
the Scythians? Or, to put it another
way, which elements of it belong to
which people?
The Ripa mountains might corres¬
pond to the Urals, while the legends
about their gold and the griffins who
guard it certainly reflect notions about
the mining of gold in regions round
the Urals, a notion which is borne
out by ancient workings in these
regions. But the Urals range runs
from south to north, whereas the
Ripa mountains extend in latitude
right across the land to the north of
the Scythian world.
The Northern Sea which stretched
beyond them may be an echo of
what the Scythians knew about the
Arctic Ocean, although the existence
there of a bountiful country with a
warm climate is a piece of fantasy.
Yet day and night last a half-year each
in this country, and it is difficult or
indeed impossible to treat this as
anything but the reflection of a real
fact, namely the rotation of the Polar
day and night (although, of course,
they do not last "uninterruptedly" for
half a year each).
The ancestors of the ancient Ira¬
nian and Indian tribes who lived
beside the ancestors of the Scythians
had much in common with them in
terms of economy, social structure,
culture' and religion.
On the basis of the remaining
fragmentary evidence about the
Scythians and their language, as well
as the parallels within the Indo-lranian
language system, scholars have estab¬
lished the basic features of the Scy
thian language and its dialects, and
the nature of the Gods in the Scythian
pantheon.
The details of some Indian and
Iranian epics and traditions also
correspond precisely to Scythian
conceptions about the North. In
the two great epics of India, the
Mahabharata and the Rämäyana, for
example, we find a geographical
foundation in the form of a "northern
panorama".
They relate how far away to the
north of India, beyond the real moun¬
tains and deserts, countries and
peoples, and beyond fabulous king¬
doms and tribes, stand the sacred
mountains of Meru. Their golden
peaks thrust into the sky and around
them revolve the heavenly bodies.
Beyond the mountains of Meru lies
the Northern Sea, identified with the
White, or Milky Sea. On its shores
and on the northern slopes of the
Meru live a fabulous, blessed people,
"divorced from all evil, indifferent to
all concepts of honour and dishonour,
wonderful in appearance and abound¬
ing in vitality."
There, beyond the mountains of
Meru, over whose summits "the
golden haired sun rises for half a
year"... "the day lasts half a year and
the night as long", and "one night
and one day together equal a year".
The stationary polar star is mentioned
as also are the position of constella¬
tions which can only be observed in
the Far North, above the latitude of
55 North. These descriptions of the
same inaccessible northern country
are "communicated" by the sacred
bird Garuda to the hermit Galava
before carrying him off to this far¬
away "land of blessedness".
It is important to note that the
information about "polar phenomena"
in Indian epic tales goes back to a
time when it could not have been
influenced by Indian astronomy.
Therefore, the "polar" motifs in the
tales of India must be seen as "infor¬
mation" gained from the north.
The whole epic and mythological
setting in which these polar allusions
appear in early Indian tradition indi¬
cates that they belong to the legends
which the ancestors of Indian tribes
had preserved since the time when
they were neighbours of related tribes
living to the north.
In the ancient Iranian Avesta (or
Zend Avesta) together with its affi¬
liated works of Zoroastrian literature,
similar mythological motifs have also
been preserved. These include men¬
tion of the blessed abode of a fabu¬
lous people who see the sun rise and
set only once a year and for whom a
day and a night last a year. Their
benevolent land is situated near cold
countries, where the winter lasts for
10 months and there are two months
of cold summer, beside great nor¬
thern mountains. These mountains,
which reach the heavens, play the
same "astronomical" role as in Indian
and Scythian tradition.
All this leads to the conclusion that
there is a common origin to the Indo-
lranian legends about countries in
the Far North and the tradition about
remote regions lying beyond the
Scythians. This whole cycle of
interrelated concepts has a single
archaic religious basis.
In each of the three traditions,
Indian, Iranian and Scythian, the
whole panorama is arranged in the
same order, proceeding from real
geographical areas in the south to
the legendary lands by the Northern
Ocean. In each tradition, this ocean
is inaccessible to mortals and their
attempts to make their way there end
either in failure or in the death of a
bold hero, whose route takes him
through the territory of fabulous
tribes and supernatural creatures.
At this point we have a clearer idea
of the "geographical" distribution of
those characters whom the Scythians,
and after them the Greeks, located
between Scythia and the northern
mountainsthe death-bearing mai¬
dens who lived in darkness, the
Arimaspeans, the griffins and others.
The Indian story-tellers, for exam¬
ple, warned that in the foothills of
the Meru there lay a deserted region
of gloom, which filled mortals with
fear of the dark. Monsters, vam¬
pires, female cannibals and evil giants
inhabited this dreadful place.
But the ¡mage of the "winter"
barrier has practically disappeared
from the stories of torrid India. The
legends of the Iranians, however, a
people geographically and ethnically
closer to the Scythians, mention the
fatal hard frost of winter, which
comes from the great northern moun¬
tains. They also refer to the death
in the foothills of heroes who freeze
in the snow carried by the hostile
wind. This role is obviously played
in Scythian legends by the North
Wind, which blows from the slopes
of the Ripas and destroys the traveller.
It is notable that Herodotus also
mentions several times that it is
impossible to penetrate the northern
regions beyond Scythia because of
the excessive snows and the coid.
He also held the view that in general
people did not live there. But the
north of Europe, as far as the Arctic
Ocean, was inhabited long before
the pre-Scythian and the Scythian
epochs. Even the Scythians referred
to several "peoples" as living there,
although they endowed them with
unusual features.
We find in the Indian and Iranian
stories that there is a direct link
between this theme and one of the
epic cycles, which concludes with
the victorious king (Yudhisthira in
the Mahabharata, and Khosrow in
Iranian epic) leaving his kingdom
and arriving alive in the blessed land
of the northern mountains. At the
same time, the heroes who accom¬
pany him perish in the snow, which

CYCLOPS Vs.

SENTINELS
Far beyond Scythia,
according to legend,
lived fabulous creatures
such as the Arimaspeans
and the griffins. The
winged griffins guarded
a store of gold from
the giant one-eyed
Arimaspeans who were
always trying to steal it.
Legends of their struggles
entered the mythology
of many peoples, as is
shown by these strikingly
similar scenes of combats
between the giant
Cyclops and the griffins,
found in two distant
places. The one above

headdress from a burial
mound at Great Blisnitza,

Black Sea; the other

also to Herodotus, makes the route
to the north from the Scythian king¬
dom impassable.
Other chosen heroes and righteous
men could only reach this land on
their death. However, there existed
another "means" of getting there, for
a limited time, and this means was
available only to certain renowned
sages, priests and hermits. These
miraculous "journeys" also formed
the subjects of Indian, Iranian and
Scythian legends. Such, for example,
were the exploits of Galava, Narada
and Shuka in the Mahabharata and
of Arda-Viraz in Zoroastrian tradition.
In the ancient world there was a
story about the Scythian, Abaris,
who "arrived" from the land of the
Hyperboreans. He had "made his
way across rivers, seas and impas¬
sable places, as if he were travelling
through air" and during this time had
performed purifications, had driven
out pestilent diseases, predicted
earthquakes, calmed the winds
and soothed the waves of the sea.
The "information" about Abaris
was basically preserved by the Pytha¬
gorean brotherhood, who included it
among their conceptions about the
migration of the soul. But the
legends about him obviously emerged
independently. Herodotus also knew
about the "journeys" of Abaris and
related that "he did not take any¬
thing for food". But Herodotus pre¬
ferred to give a more detailed account
of that other legendary figure, Ari-
steas, relating how, while the body
of Aristeas lay in one place, he
himself appeared in another, or how,
while following Apollo, Aristeas took
on the form of a raven.
The basis of the legends about
Aristeas were traditions formed in
the time of the earliest contact
between Greeks and Scythians. There
was a definite similarity between
several aspects of Scythian religious
beliefs and practice and the Greek
cult of Apollo, of which Aristeas was
an initiate. And it was this simila¬
rity that led to the widespread
dissemination of the legends about
Aristeas.
The poem Arimaspea, reputed to
have been written by Aristeas, also
mentioned the journey to the land
of "the blessed people" lying beyond
Scythia and the great mountains on
the shore of the Northern Ocean.
The poem is in fact concerned with
a real journey through Scythia and
talks about the tribes which inhabit
it, their life and their customs.
The author of the poem was also
familiar with the subjects of the myths
and the epic which were current
among the Scythians and their neigh¬
bours. The "flight" of Aristeas to
the land of the blessed Northern
people is considered by several scho¬
lars to reflect conceptions about the
"journeys" of the soul. These con¬
ceptions had undoubtedly been bor¬
rowed from cults of a shamanic type.
"During ceremonies", writes the
eminent Soviet anthropologist Sergei
Tokarev, "the shaman frequently falls
unconscious; this is bound to make
the spectators think of the flight of
his 'soul'; the delirium and the hallu¬
cinations of the shaman often consist
in his seeing far-away countries and
talking loudly about hisjourneyings."
A particular role was played by the
cult of birds: the shaman or his soul
"set off" on their distant travels in
the form of a bird (most often, a
raven), "flying over" familiar or mythi¬
cal countries.
Shamanism was widespread in
Antiquity among the peoples of the
north, in Asia and in Europe. Butw

Jranians and Scythians belong as a
whole to another type despite some
similarities in their epic and myth to
the images of "northern mythology".
However, a good many Iranian and
Indian specialists consider that the
religious practice of the Indians,
Iranians and Scythians had features
that were similar to northern shama¬
nism, especially that of the Finno-
Ugrians.
Historians know something about
the earliest connexions between the
ancestors of the ancient Indians,
Iranians and Scythian tribes and the
ancestors of the Finno-Ugrians. They
know, for instance, of many simila¬
rities between the languages of these
peoples. Among these is the name
of the ecstatic medium with the aid
of which the shamans and priests
put themselves into a state of ritual
possession.
Various plants were used for this
purpose, including hemp. The Scy¬
thians also were aware of these pro¬
perties of hemp and used it in cult
ceremonies. The Greek lexicogra¬
pher Hesychius informs us that hemp
is "the Scythian smoking plant" and
is so powerful that it makes all parti¬
cipants in this ritual sweat. The
Western neighbours of the Scythians,
the inhabitants of Thracia, used
hemp in preparing a sacred libation.
This is what Herodotus has to tell
us about the practice: the Scythians
"place three poles leaning towards
each other, and pull onto them strips
of woollen felt, stretching these to
fit as tightly as possible. They then
throw red-hot stones into a vessel
standing between these poles and the
woollen strips.
"In their land grows hempa plant
very like flax, but much coarser and
taller; it grows wild there and is also
sown by the people... The Scythians
take the seeds of the hemp, crawl
under the felt strips and there throw
the seeds onto the heated stones;
these seeds give out such a vapour
as no Grecian steam-bath can exceed.
The Scythians enjoy this and howl
loudly..."
This probably reflects a ritual cere¬
mony which is reminiscent of shama-
nic practices. If this is the case,
then the "howl" represents the song
of the servant of the cult, in a state
of ecstasy which is attained by the
stupefying effect of the smoke from
roasting hemp seeds. Herodotus'
account and the ritual nature of the
custom he describes are confirmed by
the excavations of the famous Soviet
archaeologist Sergei Rudenko, in the
Altai mountains of Siberia (see p. 34).
In the burial mounds of the Altai
(5th-4th centuries B.C.) the perma¬
frost layer has preserved some small
huts made of poles lashed together
at the top (two of the huts had
covers on them, one of woollen felt
and the other of hide). In one of
these graves copper vessels were
On wings
of ecstasy
According to Scythian mythology a fabulous
land where day and night each lasted half
a year lay far to the north in the polar
regions. It was a bountiful country that
could be reached only by heroes and sages.
This belief, recorded by many Greek and
Roman authors of antiquity, closely
resembles those found in ancient Indian
and Persian mythologies and epics, which
describe an earthly paradise lying beyond
towering mountains towards the north.
How were the priests, sages and heroes
to reach this reputedly inaccessible land?
According to the Shamanic traditions of
the Asian steppes the journey could be
accomplished by entering into an ecstatic
state, the secret of which was known to the
shaman. Soothsayer and healer, the
shaman could transform himself into a bird
(Siberian shaman in drawing at left wears
costume with sleeves representing wings).

And his soul, leaving his body, took flight.
One way in which the shaman attained a
state of ecstasy was by inhaling the fumes
of hemp. The remains of a "hemp" tent
(seen at left) were found in a tomb at
Pazyryk. They consist of the tent poles
and a receptacle for burning hemp seeds.
In Indian legends the journey to the mythical
country was accomplished on the back of
sacred birds such as Garuda (above left
in a 19th-century Indian miniature). In
northern Europe and the Urals, the legendary
bird was depicted on metal plaques (drawings
opposite page). These plaques shaped as
bird-like creatures often bore representations
of the face or standing figure of a man.

found under such a structure: they
contained stones which had been
in a fire and partially charred hemp
seeds; in addition, a leather bag,
containing hemp seeds, was tied to
one of the hut poles. Similar sha-
manic ceremonies, performed in
yurts or chums (conical pole-huts
used by the Asian nomads) have been
described by anthropologists.
Facts are also known about the
use of other plants as a means of
achieving ecstasy during cult cere¬
monies and Indian and Iranian reli¬
gious texts record a legend derived
from a common source about the
theft of a cult plant, the soma-plant, .
from the great mountains by the
sacred bird Garuda, also called Sh'ena
in the Rgveda, a collection of Vedic
hymns to the deities. Iranian tradi¬
tion calls the same creature Saena,
and later Simurg.
Legends similar to those which
were told about Garuda in ancient
India and Simurg in Iran were cur¬
rent among the Scythians. This
huge "wonder-bird" was also one
of the mythological images used
by the forest tribes of north-eastern
Europe, the Urals and the land
beyond the Urals.
The same creature is also depicted
on the large number of metal plaques
portraying birds and bird-like crea¬
tures, on the bodies of which the face
or the standing figure of a man is
often represented. Excavations have
shown that such subjects were quite
common even in the Scythian epoch.
This mythology and epic reflects
not just legendary conceptions and
the products of fantasy but also
real facts about the surrounding
world. The mythology of the Scy¬
thians, as much ' as that of other
peoples, was a characteristic combi¬
nation of fantasy and the rudiments
of scientific thought.
Not only did the Greeks expand
their geographical horizon through
their contacts with the Scythians
but, as a result of their familiarity
with Scythian epic, myth and cosmo¬
logy, even in semi-legendary form,
they acquired new information about
the geography of the remote forest
zone, the northern Arctic Ocean, and
the "polar phenomena".
The "Scythian source" may be
viewed as the first stage in the his¬
tory of European science's know¬
ledge of the Far North. And although
new information was added to this
store later in Antiquity, Greek and
Latin authors, in describing the
northern countries, continued for
many centuries to refer to the tradi¬
tion which went back to the 7th-6th
centuries B.C. and was based on
information acquired from the Scy¬
thian world of the time.

THE OSSETES .SCYTHIANS
OF THE 20TH CENTURY
THE Scythian people did not disap¬
pear from the face of the earth
without leaving a trace. If we look at an
ethnographic map of the Caucasus,
which is a patchwork of more than
forty different nationalities, we find in
the" central part a small group of people,
known as the Ossetes, whose popula¬
tion numbers 400,000.
It was established long ago that the
Ossetes are in no way related to their
Caucasian neighbours. Immigrants from
the steppes of south Russia, they are
descendants of the Alani who, according
to Josephusa Jewish scholar and his¬
torian of the first century A.D.were a
Scythian tribe living in the vicinity of the
Don and the Sea of Azov.
During the great migrations of the
fourth and fifth centuries A.D., some
of the Alani moved across Europe as
far as France and Spain. The French
name Alain and the English Alan date
from that period.
The remaining Alani made their way
from Eastern Europe to the foothills of
VASILY IVANOVICH ABAEV, a well-
known Soviet scholar and orientalist, is a spe¬
cialist in Iranian civilization and in the lan¬
guage and folklore of the Ossetes. He is

Studies of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences
and is the author of 250 studies Including a
monograph on Scytho-European linguistic
geography.
the Caucasus, where they established
what was for the times a powerful
feudal state. They were converted
to Christianity in the tenth century, and
during the Middle Ages they main¬
tained active relations with Byzantium,
Georgia and Russia.
The Mongol invasion and the cam¬
paigns of Tamerlane were a disaster for
the Alani: one part of the population
was annihilated in the incessant wars;
another fled to Hungary, where they
were known as the 'As" and retained
their ethnic individuality for another
several hundred years. A third part
joined in the expeditions of the maraud¬
ing Mongolians and was dispersed in
foreign lands.
The Alani who remained in the Cau¬
casus took refuge in the narrow passes
of the central regions.
One cannot help comparing the vast
territory between the Altai in the east
and the Danube in the west, which
had been the home of the Scytho-
Sarmatian tribes during the last millen¬
nium of the pre-Christian period, with
the handful of narrow ravines which
was all that was left to the Ossetes
in the 18th century A.D.
Here, indeed is food for thought
about the reverses of fortune ! At
Pitsunda, on the Black Sea coast, a
little grove of pine trees is all that
remains of a once-enormous forest.
Fate dealt similarly with the ancient
Scythian world, which is now reduced
to a tiny group of Ossetes, lost in the
Caucasian "mountains.
Two priceless treasures of their remote
past have, nevertheless, survivedtheir
language and their folklore.
The Scythians themselves left no
written texts.' But Greek epigraphic
inscriptions dating from the period
when the Scythians occupied the lands
north of the Black Sea contain hun¬
dreds of Scythian and Sarmatian com¬
mon nouns.
As eminent an authority as the Russian
philologist Vsevolod Miller and also spe¬
cialists from other countries have convin¬
cingly demonstrated that knowledge of
the Ossetic tongue makes interpretation
of these inscriptions easier and that
they can in fact be considered as
examples of the language of the ancient
Ossetes.
A number of words still used by the
Ossetes, such as "farn" (paradise), "hsar"
(military prowess), "andon" (iron), "aldar"
or "ardar" (master), "liman" (friend),
^'furt" (son), "fida" (father), "sag" (stag)
"sar" (head), "stur" (big), are easily
recognized in these inscriptions.
Modern Ossetic also provides the
key to the meaning of many names on
the map of the region between the
Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The
names of the Don, the Dnieper and
the Dniester are easier to understand,
for example, when we know that in
Osseticand in this language alonethe
word for "river" is "don".
Traces of the Scythian world as evident
HERODOTUS AMONG THE SCYTHIANS ¡continued from page w
detailed elements cast separately, sol¬
dered together in a composite article,
and then carefully polished.
The battle scene, which is depicted
in relief, is treated with meticulous
attention to detail: the decorations on
the weapons and clothing of the
warriors, and even the curls of their
hair and beards, are engraved with
extreme accuracy.
Similar virtuosity is to be found in
the execution of the Chertomlyk vase,
the frieze in particular. All the fig¬
urines, of men and horses were
moulded separately and only arranged
in a composition when they were
soldered to the vessel.
The chief interest of the objects pro¬
duced by the jewellers of the northern
Black Sea coast lies in the themes
which they represent, and in the light
which they throw on this or that
aspect of Scythian life.
Finds from the burial mounds
teach us much about Scythian wea¬
pons, clothes and ornaments, but the
picture isso to speakunfinished
and lacking in depth. On the other
hand, the scenes in relief portrayed by
the metal-workers show the objects
found by archaeologists actually
48
being used, and thus provide a fasci¬
nating glimpse of the Scythians as
they really were, at different moments
of their existence.
There can be no doubt that all
these objects had their origins in an
ancient culture and, more specifically,
jn Greek craftsmanship. In style and
tradition, they were classically Greek,
and they could only have been pro¬
duced in a context of Hellenic notions
and capacities, which conditioned all
stages of their production. Even
their secondary details, such as the
ornamental motifs of palms, acanthus-
plants and wattled designs, were
essentially Greek.
Many of the objects in metalware
were, however, Greek neither in form
nor in function. The spherical vessels
found at Kul Oba closely resemble the
earthenware vessels of the earliest
Scythian culture, and were doubtless
used in religious ceremonies, while
the torques and the plaques used as
ornaments on clothing had Scythian,
and not Greek significance.
Thus, the majority of these articles
were Greek in execution, but Scythian
in form, while the ¡mages with which
they were decorated have for a long
time and almost unanimously been
considered by scholars familiar with
the history of the region north of the
Black Sea to represent the Scythians
themselves.
The Scythians were certainly
warriors, and many images show
them in battle or resting in the middle
of their campaigns. But the artists
also depicted more peaceful times,
and the Chertomlyk vase shows them
engaged in what may well have been
a typical nomad activity, roping and
hobbling their horses.
Hunting scenes were also depicted.
A silver vessel from Solokha shows a
group of Scythian horsemen, accom¬
panied by their dogs, at grips with a
fantastic lion-like creature with horns,
which has seized a horse by the leg.^
One hunter brandishes a spear, ano¬
ther is taking aim with his bow and
arrow, while their two companions,
similarly armed, join in the fray.
Some of the small gold plaques
used as decoration for clothing and
found in the kurgans of Kul Oba,
Solokha and Chertomlyk represent
scenes of a completely different kind,
doubtless related to religious cere¬
monies.

<![CDATA[
THE MOUNTAIN REMEMBERS
THE STEPPE
Much of the folklore and tales of the
Ossetes, a small group of mountain
people in the Caucasus, originates in
the epics of the ancient Scythians of
the steppes. Here, Dris Tautiev, an
honoured bard of the Northern Osse¬
tian Republic (U.S.S.R.) and one of the
400,000 descendants of the Scythians,
sings to the strains of the "kiatmancha".
as those found in the language of the
Ossetes are also to be found in their
folklore, and more particularly in the
heroic epics which, like other peoples
of the Caucasus, they still relate. The
heroes of these epics are a race of
warriors known as the Narts.
Vsevolod Miller and the French
scholar Georges Dumézil have con¬
cluded after careful comparative ana¬
lysis that much of what happens in the
tales of their adventures corresponds
very closely to the Scythian customs
and way of life described by Herodotus
and other ancient authors. All these
sources mention, for example, an
enchanted cup from which only the
most valiant warriors may drink, sword-
worship, and very similar burial cere¬
monies.
Comparison of the Epic of the Narts
with similar narratives from other cul¬
tures immediately reveals one salient
featurethe central character is a
woman. It would be difficult to find in
other epic poems of the world a female
personality of such stature and strength.
Satána, as she is called, is the essence,
the centre through whom all things
flow. She is the mother of the people,
the provider and mentor of the principal
heroes, Soslan and Batradz. She is the
wise counsellor, the omnipotent sorceress
and the guiding force without whose
intervention nothing worthy of mention
can be accomplished. None of the
heroes is indispensable to the Epic of
the Narts. Without Satána, there is
no Epic.
Obviously so imposing a figure could
only emerge from a society where
women occupied a dominant position.
And such, according to the unanimous
testimony of ancient authors, was the
society of the Sarmatians and the Mas¬
sagètes. "The Sarmatians are governed
by their women", one of these authors
tells us. Satána thus joins the ranks of
the Scythian, Saka and Massagete
queens and warrior-maidens, to stand
beside Zarina, Amaga and Tomiris,
whose names have also been handed
down by tradition. She is a product of
the steppe and not of the Caucasus.
Nor do the natural surroundings in
which the Epic of the Narts unfolds bear
any resemblance to the mountainfastness
of present-day Ossetia. Broad expanses
of sea and steppe are the usual setting
for the adventures of the Narts. The
wind of the steppes lashes through the
narrative. We feel the endlessness of
the Scythian plains and hear the
stampeding of horses, as a herd of
stags appears, pursued by tireless
hunters.
The Narts had the closest of rela¬
tionships with the watery element.
The founder of their people was a
daughter of Don Bettyr, the ruler of
the depths. Here, the similarity with
ancient Scythia is remarkable. The
favourite animal of Narts and Scythians
alike was the stag. In the Epic the
stag is often referred to as "Astassion"
(the Eighteen Horned One). Curiously
enough, the famous golden stags of
the Scythian animal style have exactly
eighteen branches on their horns.
In the absence of chronicles or docu¬
ments, the language and folklore of a
small settlement in the Caucasus have
bridged the gap of over 2,000 years,
bringing to us the sounds and images
of the inimitably individualistic world
of the ancient Scythians and Sarmatians.
Vasily I. Abaev
One of them shows what appears
to be a goddess (women rarely figured
in the imagery of the northern Black
Sea metal-workers) seated on a
throne, with a mirror in her hand.
In front of her sits a Scythian drinking
what is probably a magic potion from
a horn-shaped cup.
Other plaques feature a similar
drinking-horn, from which two
kneeling Scythians are drinking simul¬
taneously, in what is generally
believed to be a ritual oath-taking
such as that described by Herodotus.
By no means all the scenes which
decorate the metal objects found in
the Scythian burial mounds can be
so easily interpreted. More than a
few of them probably reflect preoccu¬
pations which lay at a deeper level
than the affairs of everyday life, and
it has been suggested they are ideo¬
logical or mythological in content,
illustrating the epics which nourished
Scythian society (see page 15).
But let us turn again to the outward
appearance of the Scythians, as they
are portrayed in these images. They
have regular features, and frequently
severe expressions, long, shoulder-
length hair andin the majority of
casesbeards and moustaches.
Their double-breasted jackets, or
caftans, are trimmed with what
appears to be fur and embroidered
designs. They wear soft, short
boots, strapped at the ankle, and
pointed, hood-like caps. They are
frequently portrayed bearing arms:
short swords, bows and arrows
carried in a case suspended from their
belts, spears, battle-axes and shields.
In a number of cases, they wear metal
helmets and armour.
The Greek craftsmen responsible
for these portraits were extremely
familiar with their subjects, and this
knovyledge is reflected in the smallest
details of the figures, scenes and
compositions.
All the objects we have mentioned
were produced largely in the fourth
century B.C., when the Scythians
occupied the whole of the area
around the northern coast of the
Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, and
when their kings were at the zenith of
their power and wealth.
This was the period when they built
the impressive royal tombs discovered
in the vicinity of the Dnieper rapids.
which have also yielded many
examples of the precious metalware
objects which wealthy Scythians
commissioned from Greek craftsmen,
specifying that they should be execu¬
ted "in the Scythian style".
A final group of metal objects
appears to depict some of the Scy¬
thian divinities encountered in the
pages of Herodotus. Thus, for
example, one gold plaque (a horse's
decorated frontlet or forehead orna¬
ment) from the Tsymbalka kurgan
shows what appears to be the goddess
Apia in the form of a serpent-woman;
while the legendary hero Targitaus
is shown in combat with a monster
on a bronze crest found in the Bliz-
nitsa Slopovskaya kurgan.
The outstanding discoveries which
marked the dawn of Russian archaeo¬
logy were followed by others. In
very recent years, excavations in the
kurgans of the Ukrainian steppes have
yielded jewellery similar to that found
at Kul Oba, Chertomlyk and Solokha.
Will there be more finds? It is hard
to say but it is more than likely that
the earth still hides the key to further
episodes in the history of the ancient
Scythians.

begin publication early in 1977, thus
bringing the total number" of language
editions in which the "Unesco Courier" is
published monthly to 1 7. The possibility
of launching a Kiswahili language edition
in Kenya or Tanzania is at present under

Death of Alexander Calder
The American sculptor Alexander
Calder, one of the great figures of
20th-century art, died in New York on
11 November 1976 at the age of 78.
He was world-famous for the moving
sculptures, or mobiles, which he began
to create in 1932 and for the monu¬
mental motionless "stabiles" he began
to make in the late 1950s. His works
now stand in public buildings and open '
spaces throughout the world. A
32-foot-high steel mobile called "Spi¬
rale" (see photo) by Alexander Calder
has been an outstanding feature of the
piazza at Unesco's Paris headquarters
since 1958.

Siberian art treasures
preserved in ice
for 2,500 years
Five centuries before the Christian Era, a nomad artist of the
steppes in the Altai region of Siberia (to the southwest of Lake
Baikal) sculpted this superb animal motif in wood. It depicts a
griffina mythical winged beast of prey -with a stag's head in its
jaws. The stag's horns and ears and the griffin's crest are
fashioned from leather, and on the mythical monster's neck two
tiny griffins are shown attacking a goose. This ornament
(35 cm. high) was discovered in a frozen tomb at Pazyryk, in the
Altai mountains, in 1949 (see article page 31).
