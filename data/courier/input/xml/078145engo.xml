(UNATIONS)
IN the short space of ten years the U.N. has been called
practically everything, from the greatest hope for
mankind to a talking shop for overpaid diplomats.
Is has been praised, it has been decried and attempts
have been made to write it off completely, but in the
words of Ralph J. Bunche, "It is after all not only the
best we have, but all we have. Indeed what alternative
to it is there but resignation to World War III."
Organizing for peace is nothing new in the world: "And
they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their
spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more"
was, after all, said seven centuries before Christ. From
the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire, through the
congresses and concerts of Europe in the 16th and 17th
centuries, there has been a growing belief that an inter¬
national organization might achieve and keep peace.
This belief has persisted in modern times and The
Hague, Locarno and the League of Nations at Geneva arc
stepping stones along the path which led to the Opera
House building in the city of San Francisco on a hot June
day in 1945. Assembled there were the plenipotentiaries
of 50 sovereign States who affixed their signatures to a
document which was designed to be a new code for
humanity the United Nations Charter. This Charter
brought into being the most ambitious experiment the
world has yet seen in international co-operation.
To what degree has the United Nations been successful
in upholding the high ideals set out in the preamble to
the Charter? Has it been successful in saving succeed¬
ing generations from the scourge of war? Has it
achieved unity in maintaining international peace and
security? As yet no complete answer can be given to
these questions. The U.N. has had its failures, but it has
also had its successes. No mention of the stresses and
tensions of the post-war years can fail to omit the part
played by the U.N. in Korea, Palestine, Kashmir, Greece
and Indonesia. At the same time it would be impossible
to ignore the abortive discussions in the Security Council
on questions which could have led to international
conflicts, and the "lack of teeth" in some of the U.N.'s
political machinery.
But despite its failures the U.N. still remains as one of
the greatest moral forces in the world of today. It is,
perhaps, the only basis on which civilization may rest its
hope to survive, and peoples can seek to avoid the indes¬
cribable catastrophe of thermo-nuclear destruction.
As the U.N. celebrates its 10th anniversary on Octo¬
ber 24th, it is a good occasion to take stock and attempt
a frank appraisal of what it has achieved. In this issue
an effort has been made in that direction.

<![CDATA[
Wa Iking into a
cinema after the
film has started
At fifteen, you are interested in a good deal that happens
much more than you were a couple of years ago.
You read the newspaper. You noticed that there was a
meeting at San Francisco to celebrate the tenth anniversary
of the United Nations Charter. You know that top states¬
men from the U.S.S.R., the U.S.A., the U.K., and France have
met in Geneva. We have talked about the Geneva meeting
on peaceful uses of atomic energy.
It strikes me that one of the difficulties at your age in
reading the news is that it is like walking into a movie after
the film has been running for an hour. It is a big crowd
scene, and people are rushing over the landscape like mad,
but it is not quite clear who is going where and why.
It has happened to all of us. The human crowd scene has
been running continuously for six thousand years of
recorded history and heaven knows how many millenia
before, and each of us has had to figure out what it was all
about and then walk into the picture and play a scene.
In the movies, of course, you can sit through the next
showing until you came to the point where you say "this is
where I came in". But when you start taking an interest
in the social scene, you cannot go back to where you came in.
You were born into a world at war
In fact, it is easier to go further back to times long before
you came in. You study history: and what is history
except a way of extending your memory. Study history,
and you can "summon up remembrance of things past". But
the history we learn in school, even if it is called modern
history usually stops just before we appeared on the stage.
It is too recent, too controversial, to get into the textbooks.
Also, it comes at the end of the school year, when the
teacher is in a hurry.' History may have extended your
memory, but there is a blank spot those years just before
you were born and since you were born the times your
mother and I have been living through. I would like to fill
in that gap a little. For now, as you begin to look around
the world scene, now when the United Nations celebrates its
tenth anniversary, now when the talk is of the peaceful
use of nuclear energy now is a time to learn or to recall
these recent times past : now is a time to remember.
You made your entrance in 1940. You were born into a
world at war. The second world war had begun one year
before. German armies had overrun Poland. Russian
forces had occupied Eastern Poland and the small Baltic
states, and had fought against Finland. In those summer
months of 1940, fifteen years ago, German armies seized
Norway and Denmark, Belgium and Holland, overwhelmed
French and British troops.
You were five years old when the war ended. During one
third of your fifteen years, most of the people on the face
of the earth were concentrating their energies and their
resources on making war. Germany, Italy and Japan were
allied. They were known as the "Axis". In 1942, it seemed
that they were destined to rule the world. From Brittany
in the West a thousand miles into Russia in the East, from
the northern tip of Norway to Athens, the German armies
and air forces were supreme. Their submarines ranged the
oceans. On the other side of the globe, Japanese sway
extended far into Asia, through Burma and the lands of the
South, over the great islands of Indonesia, far West into the
Pacific Ocean. Across North Africa the struggle raged for
control of Egypt and the Middle East.
At this time, the countries which had been attacked by
the Axis, led by the U.S.A., and the U.K., and U.S.S.R., and
China declared that they would co-operate with one another
in conducting the war, and they spoke of themselves as the
United Nations.
By the spring of 1945, Russian and American and Western
European armies had forced their way into Germany, and
they had brought to German cities the storm of destruction
from the air which their own cities had previously experienc¬
ed. Italy had been occupied. The American navy was strik¬
ing ever nearer the home islands of Japan.
It was at that time, when their victory was assured, but
while the slaughter of war still continued, that the allied
countries those that had called themselves the United
Nations agreed at San Francisco to establish a permanent
organization : the United Nations.
Like you, the United Nations was born in a world at war.
Some people might think that I am putting too much
stress on war. But I have to tell the story the way I see it
and that means for me that I must start with the fact that
the United Nations started in a time of war. I do not see
any use in telling you about the past and closing my eyes
and your eyes to this basic fact. A good deal that has
happened in the last ten years does not make much sense
unless you remember that the United Nations began as an
association of the countries that were resisting the Axis
powers and that the Charter was drawn up by those
countries.
There is another reason why the story has to start with
war. Before you can think about the United Nations you
have to know something and think something about nations.
In the story of nations war has been a repeated and often a
dominating theme. You have got to start with and accept
that fact, in order to see not only why it is essential to
organize the nations for peace but also to understand why
it is a difficult thing to do. It is not enough to be
enthusiastic for world peace, or for something that you
vaguely know about called the United Nations. You have
got to have a solid realistic basis in knowledge and under¬
standing.
War, and the ruin and misery of war were what we had
been living through in those first five years of your life.
You will find this reflected in the opening words of the
Charter of the United Nations :
"We the peoples of the united nations determined
to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,
which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to
mankind..."
Now I would like you to think for a minute about what is
involved in trying to prevent war. One way of going about
it is to try to handle particular disputes and stop them from
growing into a war. You would try, so to speak, to stop
each particular war from happening. But obviously this is
not good enough. You would try also to go deeper and to
get at underlying causes of wars. You would try to make
it less and less likely that the kinds of disputes would arise
which result in wars.
Peace keeping is like crime prevention
You can see something like this if you think about problems
of preventing crimes. We need to have ways of
handling particular crimes and particular criminals.
We have a system of laws, and police, and law-courts, and
punishments. But at the same time we want to change the
conditions that produce crimes and criminals. To the best
of our knowledge about "the causes of crimes", we want
to act along various lines. If extreme poverty is one of the
causes which leads the people to crimes, we will see whether
we can alleviate poverty. If mental illness is one of the
causes, we will try to improve our way of caring for mentally
sick people. If bad schools and bad home life seem to be
a factor, we will think of ways of improving the conditions
under which children live.

REBUILDING THE LAND
OF THE MORNING CALM
War and devastation came to the Land of the Morning Calm in 1950. Almost over¬
night, peaceful villages and towns of Korea with their bustling markets and riverside
washing places (above) became shattered, burning ruins. Civilian refugees, first in
thousands and later in millions, crowded the narrow roads (below, left) seeking safety
from the fighting. During the first winter, the U.N. Civil Assistance Command
had to feed, house and care for 2,000,000 refugees whose numbers eventually grew
to 5,000,000. When an armistice brought peace in July, 1953, Koreans with the
aid of the U.N. Korean Reconstruction Agency began reconstruction of their war-
shattered economy. UNKRA also helped to provide new schools and books for
children like the Korean farmer's little daughter (below, right).

Dear Jenny
(Continued from page 6)
stopping wars. One line was
to stop particular wars from
occurring by handling each
dispute as it arose more
wisely and by having a system
for maintaining order and
security. The other main line
was to strike deeper at the causes of war, and to bring
about conditions under which it was easier for people to work
together co-operatively.
I want to explain later some of the arrangements that are
provided in the Charter.
But first let us extend our memory a bit more, and recall
some more facts about the nations which were now proposing
to be "United Nations". People like myself looked back from
1945 to the years before this six years' war of 1939-1945. We
looked back thirty years to another war, which once we had
called the World War, but now sadly called the First World
War. Our memories of that war and what had happened
since have coloured our ideas of what might possibly be done
to save future generations from the scourge of war. To his
memories, each added whatever knowledge and wisdom he
possessed, and each had his own view of the situation of the
human race. I give you here a few recollections. Take them
only as examples of things many of us remember, and which
were present in our minds ten years ago.
It was in Europe that the two world-wide wars had start¬
ed. Not barbarian tribes, not bandit chiefs, but nations
which prided themselves on being the centres of civilization,
launched these wars and dragged the rest of the world along.
(In the first war, Germany and what was then the Austrian-
Hungarian empire and Turkey fought against Russia, France,
England, Belgium, Italy, and other countries. In 1917 the
United States of America came into it!.
Threat of international anarchy
The First World War shocked millions of people. They
had honestly believed that the "advanced" nations of
Europe, inheritors of the Christian tradition and of
democratic ideals, were progressing toward permanent peace.
They were shocked too by what seemed the utter senselessness
of those countries going to war. These were countries that
lived by manufacture and by commerce with one another.
They had everything to gain by employing for peaceful pro¬
duction and trade their elaborate systems of credit, their
tremendous industries, their skill in harnessing the energy
. supplied by coal and electricity and oil.
With so much to lose by war, how did it come about that
these countries had brought this catastrophe on themselves
and the world? And could it be prevented from happening
again? Those were questions men asked themselves as they
waited for the interminable misery to end. And the ques¬
tions are still with us.
There was one consideration which gave some grain of
hope. These countries had in their various ways brought a
system of law and order inside their boundaries. Their
people, most of them certainly, wanted peace. There was
much intelligence and much skill in managing public affairs.
Was it not reasonable to suppose that they could solve the
problem of organizing affairs among themselves?
One of the influential ideas about the time the First World
War ended was the idea of "international anarchy". Anar¬
chy is simply "lack of government". International anarchy
is lack of government among different countries. The
phrase was used to describe the situation in which countries
found themselves, and many people thought it was the basic
reason why war had occurred.
During the last 400 years people of the West became fairly
well organized as separate nations, and some of them be¬
came extremely powerful and extended their rule over other
peoples. Especially in Africa and Asia.
Looking back over the experience of the centuries before,
thoughtful people felt that the nation states had got them¬
selves into a dilemma from which it was hard to escape. On
the other hand, they prized and clung to the idea of their
complete independence but this very independence could
lead to tragic results. An independent person makes his
own decisions, and we admire him for it, but if he makes his
own decisions without paying the least attention to what
other independent people are wanting or doing, and if he
insists that he and he alone will choose his own course of
action without caring in the least about its effects on any
one else, then he is headed for trouble. In fact, inside any
nation state, or inside any kind of group, we have found
ways of putting the brakes on completely independent action
of that kind.
But the nation states claimed for themselves and insisted
on -just that kind of disastrous complete independence of
action. And if any one challenged their claims, they were
ready with their armed forces to get their own way. Within
a nation state there was a system of law, of police, of law
courts, with all manner of arrangements for deciding what
rights an individual had and for protecting him in his rights.
But among the nation states there was no system of law, no
way of determining what the "rights" of a country were, no
way of protecting a country's rights except through its own
strength.
Nations were claiming rights one against another: it might
be over a piece of land they disputed with their neighbour, it
might be over some right of trading at the other end of the
earth, it might be over a right to rule some group of people
for reasons which seemed quite satisfactory to the ruler, or it
might be the right to bring about the freedom of people who
were ruled by another nation. And if any of these claims led
to a dispute with another country, there was no power out¬
side the two of them with authority to insist on a peaceful
settlement.
H
Six million voters backed the League
ere then was part of the problem. How could nations
remain independent and still avoid the disastrous
results of their own unlimited independence?
When the First World War ended, and the peace treaties
were made, the idea was strong that we must end the "'inter¬
national anarchy". Accordingly, an agreement was drawn up
(known as the "Covenant") by which the League of Nations
was established. President Wilson, of the USA, was one of
the statesmen who insisted most strongly on this. The League
had a general assembly, and a smaller executive committee
(the Council). The countries in the League agreed to submit
their disputes to the League, and use all possible ways of
coming to a peaceful agreement. If necessary, the Council
would make a decision. A country that defied the Council
and attacked of the other would be declared an "aggressor".
The Council would recommend action to be taken by the
other members of the League, to stop the aggressor. (We
called this "imposing sanctions").
You can imagine how hopeful people were that the League
would turn out successful. In the first ten years, it settled
quite a number of disputes. In 1935, there was a vote in
England that showed that six million out of the eight mil¬
lion who voted were willing to back the League even to the
extent of imposing "military sanctions", i.e. going to war
against an aggressor.
Yet the League failed. The second World War eventually
came. In the years 1930 to 1939, aggression did occur, and
the governments in the League did not get behind the League
to stop it. They could make excuses. Did you know that
the United States did not join the League? Other govern¬
ments could say, "We can't stop an aggressor if the USA
doesn't help". Or they could say, "We are peaceful, we have
reduced our armaments, we can't make war. _ Besides this
dispute won't really matter to our people".
When aggression seemed to pay
So aggression seemed to succeed, and to increase.
Yet, when we pass a verdict of "failure" on the League of
Nations, let us remember how near it came to success.
There was a moment in 1935 when a great country, Italy, was
declared an aggressor, and the membe.s of the Lesgue
seemed prepared to enforce sanctions. But the governments
finally drew back.
We remembered all this in 1945. We wondered if the USA
had joined, if USSR had joined earlier, if the League had
met one severe test successfully? Perhaps we could do better
next time.
The first World War came as a surprise and a shock. We
moved toward the second knowing that tragedy was in the
making.
In the Far East, Japan had become a modernized industrial
state. She had learned from the West not only science and
technology, but the idea that a great industrial power must
have colonies. And the idea was strong in Japan that the
Jaoanese had a rightor a dutyto govern other peoples.
From 1931 on, those Japanese who were determined to estab¬
lish a Japanese empire increasingly got control in Japan.
First in Manchuria, then later in China itself, Japanese ar¬
mies were on the march. The League declared
Japan an aggressor (1932) but the governments (Cont'd on
took no action whatever against her. next page)

Dear Jenny
(Continued)
Mussolini, the fascist dic¬
tator of Italy, joined tne
ranks of aggressors. He
picked on Abyssinia, one of
the few independent coun¬
tries in Africa. This was
in 1935. This was the time
when the League of Nations almost succeeded. But' in the
end Mussolini was left alone, and another "backward" people
lost its freedom.
Then it was on Hitler that the eyes of the civilized world
were fixed, in horror. The German people had set up a demo¬
cratic republic after the First World War. In spite of the
burden of reparations they had to pay, and the terrible infla¬
tion which had made their money worthless, and the bitter
resentments which (naturally enough) were felt against the
peace treaty, still it seemed in the nineteen twenties that
Germany would become a centre of humane and liberal and
democratic life.
Instead, in 1933, Hitler and his Nazi party came into power.
They exterminated liberalism and democracy. Opponents
were thrown into concentration camps. The Jewish people
were marked for persecution and for slaughter. The Ger¬
mans it was proclaimed, were a master race. The Nazi
empire would last a thousand years. And nothing, nobody,
would be allowed to stand in its way. Many people in other
countries could not believe this. They thought the stories of
concentration camps were exaggerated. They let Hitler
persuade them that each time he claimed some territory,
Germany had some kind of "right" or this was his last
demand and Hitler would settle down peacefully.
In 1938 he was allowed to take part of Czechoslovakia: it
was inhabited partly by Germans. But in March, 1939, he
took over all of Czechoslovakia. That was the climax of
efforts to "appease" Hitler. When he moved against Poland
on September 1, Britain and France declared war.
We remembered all this in 1945. Wilful, conscious aggres¬
sion does occur. We had seen it occur. The need seemed
all the greater to set up a strong system to deter and stop
aggressors.
We asked ourselves, what led Germany and Italy and Japan
into this course of military adventure and aggression. What
might lead other people along the same route? Four ideas
that seem to me to be very important are reflected in the
Charter of the United Nations.
End to economic throat-cutting
First of all, we looked back over the 30 years since the
first World War ended, and concluded that the terrible
economic collapse and the depression in the early
nineteen thirties was one of the causes of the failure of the
League of Nations. It was during this depression that Hitler
came into power in Germany. In this world where nations
claim to be so independent, they are terribly interdependent,
or dependent on one another, economically. A collapse of
business in one country reaches out and affects other count¬
ries. If nations could plan to work together on economic
problems they might better be able to hold off economic de¬
pressions. Instead of trying to cut each other's throats in
international trade, they might be able to increase interna¬
tional trade and increase one another's prosperity.
Secondly, as we looked around the world it was obvious that
from country to country people lived under very different
social and economic conditions. In a few favoured lands, the
resources of science and technology were used not only to
increase production and raise the standard of living but to
guard people against plagues and pest^ence, to give the chil¬
dren schooling, and to enrich their cultural life.
At the other end of the scale people were still the victims
of famine and diseases and ignorance as they have been for
centuries. Such a lack of balance is bound, it seems, to
produce strains and tensions, jealousies and fears, that
might result in war. Should not the countries of the world
co-operate in sharing the benefits of science and technology?
And would not this co-operation not only bring material
benefit but demonstrate and strengthen a new spirit of
international sympathy?
Thirdly, there was the fact known to all of us that many
peoples were ruled by foreign nations, and especially that
the nations of Western Europe ruled empires in Asia and
Africa. Equally well known was the fact that throughout
the world the yearning and demands for free independence
was growing. Here, historically, was one of the recurring
sources of conflict. Could not a fresh spirit be introduced
here too? It was not for this new international organization
to tell countries they must at once give up control of other
territories, but the nations could and did put into the
Charter the basic idea that in governing "'dependent"
peoples a nation had a duty to assist those people to develop
toward self-government.
Fourthly, you will remember that the Charter was written
by countries which were resisting the Axis powers. As they
asked themselves what steps had led the Axis powers to
make war, they recalled how during the past 20 years indi¬
vidual freedom had been reduced and destroyed in those
countries. The destruction of human rights inside a country,
they thought, was one of the basic steps by which its people
were moulded and prepared for war. They believed there¬
fore that it was essential to assert and maintain individual
freedom and that the countries that joined the United Na¬
tions ought to work together for this purpose.
Stay out of Europe's quarrels
These recollections of the years before 1945 would be quite
incomplete if I didn't speak a little about the United
States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (which for convenience, we'll speak of simply as
Russia).
The U.S.A. had far and away the largest industries in the
world. In many fields of industry it produced as much as
the rest of the world put together. Since modern war uses
the same resources as peaceful production, the U.S.A. was
also the strongest military power at the end of the second
war.
After the first World War, many Americans, perhaps most
had had the feeling that they didn't want to get mixed up
in any more of "Europe's1" quarrels and the U.S.A. stayed out
of the League of Nations. This feeling was very strong right
down to 1939. But the U.S.A. did get involved again; and
the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour finally brought them
into the war. Now, in 1945, few Americans believed that
they could go back to "isolation". They remembered such
things as I have been telling you. They believed they must
join in a new world organization.
Rivalling the U.S.A. in its strength was Russia. The re¬
volution in Russia nearly forty years ago (in 1917) had
brought into power the Communist party. They had set
about making Russia a great industrial power. It seemed
that they had succeeded, for they had fought their way back
against the invading Nazi armies. In spite of the terrible
destruction to their country in the years of invasion, their
capacity to recover seemed unlimited.
Now it is a simple historical fact that the Russian re¬
volution and the policies of the Communist party had
aroused the most violent feelings in the rest of the world.
There were those who believed that Russian communism
was the hope of the world: that only the acceptance of their
system could finally liberate the world from poverty and
war. And the Communists believed that the powerful non-
communist countries were looking for the opportunity to
destroy communism. At the other extreme, many people
believed that the Communists were bent on destroying capi¬
talism by revolution and war. One of the chief excuses
given by Fascists and Nazis for their policies was that they
were protecting their countries from communist revolutions.
One can find plenty of facts to justify all these mutual
fears.
A new factor the atom bomb
But in 1945, both U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. had been allies in the
war against the Axis. Both had come into the war as a
direct result of being attacked. Both wanted peace.
And if these two great countries would join in a new organi¬
zation to keep peace, and if both could be counted on never
to launch an aggressive war then peace might be assured.
Finally, there was the atom bomb. How could we fail to
remember that. It was only on August 6, 1945, that the
world learned that an atom bomb had been made: on that
day Hiroshima was , destroyed. Four days later a second
bomb destroyed Nagasaki. Within ten days Japan had laid
down her arms.
Here was a new fact. Men could lay waste whole cities at
a single blow. And the bomb had in fact been used.
The Charter of the United Nations had been completed
some weeks before the destruction of Hiroshima. The atomic
age and the United Nations were born together.
I think I'll stop here and go on with my story later.

1945: Where
did we go
from there?
I have tried to give you an idea of some of the problems we
were conscious of when the Organization of the United
Nations was formed. And I have tried to do this in part
by recalling some of the events which we vividly remembered.
There we were, then, in 1945, and the leaders of the countries
which had called themselves the "United Nations"* united
in war against the Axis powers were assembled in San
Francisco to establish a permanent organization.
Their problem: how can countries go on being "indepen¬
dent" without getting into war with one another? Two main
lines of action were:
first: make some arrangements for settling disputes
peacefully as they arise, and at the same time, make arrange¬
ments to stop a country that starts a war;
second: make some arrangements for curing ahead of
time the conditions that might lead to disputes and war.
You might re-read these last few lines, and then read
these purposes of the U.N., which are stated in the Charter:
"1. to maintain international peace and security;
2. to develop friendly relations among nations based on
respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peo¬
ples;
3. to co-operate in solving international problems of an
economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in
promoting respect for human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all; and
4. to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in
attaining these common ends."'
In the first purpose, the word "security" refers to what I
have called the first main line.
The second purpose is connected especially with the fact
that countries want to be "'independent" and to have their
independence recognized and accepted by other countries.
The third purpose relates to what I call the "second main
line".
Stop for a moment and consider the fourth purpose: "to
be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in attain¬
ing these common ends'". It answers a question which may
have occurred to you: why set up an- organization? I mean,
if countries want to co-operate and settle disputes peacefully,
or combine to stop an aggressor, and so on, can't they do it
easily enough?
Why organize? The reason for setting up an organization
is to make co-operation easier, habitual and systematic. In
our personal affairs, we don't go far in carrying out good
intentions without forming good habits and doing things
systematically. In any social groups including, of course,
such big social groups as nations we take it for granted
that we need systematic arrangements for getting things
done co-operatively. We certainly need to strengthen co¬
operation among countries by making it easier, more ha¬
bitual, more systematic. The tendencies to fly apart, to
work at cross purposes, to get into irreconcilable antagonism
are terribly strong. We need a centre or centres for
"'harmonizing our efforts".
Now I want to - explain some of the arrangements that
were made for carrying out the purposes of the U.N. First,
here are some general points, then arrangements about "se¬
curity", and then arrangements for international co-opera¬
tion in other matters.
The U.N. is an organization and its members are the inde¬
pendent countries which join it. As in most organizations
the members meet the expenses by paying annual contribu¬
tions. They hold an annual meeting which every member has
a right to attend. This is the General Assembly. The Assembly
may discuss any question or any matters within the scope of
the U.N. Remember, the U.N. is an organization of independent
countries, not a new kind of super-government. Consequently,

Two U.N. agencies the
United Nations Children's
Fund and the World
Health Organization
have scored outstanding
success since their creation

the General Assembly cannot do some things that a legisla¬
ture does, such as pass laws or impose taxes. It can express
views of the members and can make recommendations to its
members, and decide what things the Organization itself
will do.
As to membership, you will recall that the U.N. started
with the countries that were fighting against the Axis. They
were the founding members. Membership is open to all
other "'peace-loving" states. Many of us thought in 1945
that all other countries would become members quite quickly,
but it has not worked out that way. The question of admit¬
ting new members has been mixed up with arguments on other
matters between some of the member countries, and some
UNATIONS
applications for membership have been rejected. Most
people would agree, I think, that the U.N. cannot be com¬
pletely effective unless all countries belong.
Another general point : The members of the U.N. make
quite a number of promises when they accept membership.
These promises are not written in the form "'we promise to
do so and so". They are implied promises. They appear in
such phrases as these: "All members shall give the United
Nations every assistance in any action it takes in accordance
with the present Charter."' When we join an organization
whose constitution contains statements like that, we virtually
promise to accept the obligations.
The arrangements for maintaining security (that is, for
settling disputes and stopping
aggression) are intelligible,
but not simple. The chief
responsibility for this part of
the work was given to a
committee called "The Security
Council". The Council consists
of 11 member countries. Six
of them are elected by the
General Assembly. The other
five are permanent members;
they are named in the Char¬
ter : China, France, U.S.S.R.,
United Kingdom and U.S.A.
This Council may investigate
any dispute, or even any si¬
tuation that might give rise to
dispute. It can recommend
methods for settling the dis¬
pute. It can decide that some
;ountry has committed an act
of aggression, and can then
call on the members to help
stop the aggression by cutting
off trade and similar proced¬
ures. If it thinks necessary, it
can decide to use force and
call on the member states to
supply the necessary armed
forces. The members of the-

Dear Jenny
(Continued)
even including the decision
that they shall contribute
from their armed forces to
stop aggression.
There are two points
about the Security Council
which many people have
found hard to undertand. First, there is the fact that
five countries are named as permanent members. The
second is this: at every point in its work, except questions
of procedure, "decisions shall be made by an affirmative
vote of seven members, including the concurring votes of
the permanent members". The phrase I have emphasized
means that any one of the permanent members can prevent
the Security Council from reaching a decision by voting
"no" (there are some exceptions to this, but I do not want
to confuse you with these). The power that a permanent
member has to stop a decision from being reached by saying
"no" is popularly called "the veto
power".
People have argued vehemently
whether these two points I have
mentioned permanent members and
"veto" power of permanent members
are strengths or weaknesses of the
Security Council (and therefore of the
U.N.). I shall try only to give you my
understanding of why they appear in
the Charter.
You must go back to 1945. There at
the table were representatives of the
countries which had poured out
their resources to resist aggression.
Measured in various ways their past
leadership, their present strength,
their future probable strength, the
strongest of these countries, it seemed,
were China, France, U.K., U.S.S.R.,
U.S.A. It would depend on these five
to carry the main burden should it
ever prove necessary again to resist
aggression. If they agreed, step by
step, up to the final terrible point even
of using armed forces, they could stop
any foreseeable aggression. But if
they disagreed, if one or more of these
great powers was unwilling to join in
a decision and consequently could not
be counted to help in the ultimate
emergency, then the prospect of
successful resistance to aggression was
slight indeed.
Rather than forcing the issue by a
majority vote against the will of one
of its permanent members, it would be
better to try again and find some
approach on which all would agree.
To put it quite briefly: A decision on
such important matters by a split vote
among the permanent members would
be as bad as and possibly worse than
no decision at all The responsibility
was placed on the five permanent
members to exert every possible effort
to find solutions in which all of them
concur.
I hope that what I have said will help you to understand
references to the Security Council and to the "veto", when
you read about them in the newspapers, and I hope you
will try to get much more information through your studies
before you make up your mind about the many difficult
problems involved.
A subsidiary point about the Security Council: I mentioned
above that some countries have applied for admission to
the U.N. but have been rejected. The Security Council has
been involved in this. New members are admitted by the
General Assembly, but the application goes first to the Se¬
curity Council, and a permanent member can "veto" it. This
use of the veto has annoyed many people.
The second main line of U.N.'s work, I said, is inter¬
national co-operation to improve conditions which may lead
to disputes. What is involved? Bad conditions in almost
every field of human activity can contribute to ill-feeling,
tension, hostility. There is no end to these social and econo¬
mic problems: poverty and disease and ignorance; poor
resources and badly used resources; poor soil and bad farm¬
ing; little industrial equipment and little skill in using it;
most of the people in the world live under these conditions.
They are socially and economically under-developed.
But that is only part of the problem. Countries can be
economically well developed, but have social and economic
troubles, as we all know: depressions, for example, or
quarrels between employers and employees. They make
trouble for one another sometimes by the very action they
take to ease trouble at home: through high tariffs on foreign
goods for example. How then can the United Nations help
to solve these problems? That is, how can we help one
another through this international organization?
The U.N. is not going into a country to build factories and
hospitals and schools. It has neither the money nor the
authority. Yet perhaps it can help.
Naturally, we start by appointing a committee ! We call it
the Economic and Social Council. And the Council sets up
more committees which we call Commissions. There are
Commissions on economic problems of different regions of
the worldfEurope, Asia, Latin America. There are

study fellowships by the International Labour Organization, help Dutch welders build the keel of a
tanker. One of the oldest specialized agencies, I.L.O. has brought government, labour, and employees
together to solve Industrial problems, raise standards of wages and working conditions.
Commissions on different subjects: the status of women,
human rights, narcotic drugs, social problems.
We reflect: our Economic and Social Council has an
enormous field of work, so have the Security Council and
the General Assembly. We do not want to over-load our
organization. Perhaps it would be better to set up some
separate organizations, each of which will look after a spe¬
cial set of problems. Health, for example. And Agriculture.
We reca'.l that the nations have already set up some
"specialized" organizations. We have long had the Universal
Postal Union which sees to it that letters can move easily
from country to country. And already, when we had the
League of Nations, we had set up the International Labour
Organization to promote better conditions for workers. Good:
we will have more of these specialized agencies.
Here are some of those we now have.
To promote better labour conditions and social justice:
International Labour Organization.
To promote better agriculture and food production:

There is the Universal Postal Union, and there are others,
dealing with money problems, and radio, and weather (I
mean information and research about weather).
All these are usually referred to, rather familiarly, by their
initials, or one word in their name:
ILO, FAO, UNESCO, ICAO, BANK, UPU, FUND, ITU, WHO, WMO.
As a teacher, I wish the statesmen could have made all
these kinds of committees and agencies easier to learn.
Anyway, there is the United Nations Organization, turned
into a large family of organizations, with lots of small
children in the way of commissions, committees, boards, and
so forth. We have organized for action: what do we do?
Most of what the United Nations does sounds so dull that
I am almost afraid to tell you. Look at this, from a news¬
paper I read this very day:
The Proceedings in the U. N.
Sept. 12, 1955.
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
United Nations Children's Fund, Executive Board
preliminary reports on joint project of
specialized agencies to improve nutrition in
underdeveloped areas.
Heard a report... Not much in that !
But look a bit further. United Nations Children's vFund
(or unicef) is something very special. You can contribute
to it, directly, yourself, and not merely through your govern¬
ment. When I was in Belgium last year I saw large signs
in the streets urging people to give to unicef. The money
is used to help children. all over the World, without regard
to race, creed, nationality or political belief. Let a govern¬
ment say, We have urgent need and unicef will help (if it
has enough money).
Reports are not exciting. But read this from an official
report:
"unicef provides equipment and supplies, primarily in
rural areas, for maternal and child welfare centres, children's
hospitals or wards, school health services, clinics, laboratories.
Assistance includes midwifery kits; scales, thermometers,
needles, syringes; transport; hospital equipment, drugs;
Unesco Courier. N" 10. 1955
serum, vaccines, common medicines, soap, disinfectants;
powdered milk, fish-liver oil capsules and other diet supple¬
ments; health education materials; dental training equip¬
ment... unicef provides dried skim and whole milk and fish-
liver oil capsules containing vitamins A and D, rice and
sugar, for supplementary diets to be furnished over a period
of years."
Fifty or sixty countries contributing and thousands of in¬
dividuals besides: sixty million children in seventy countries
saved from hunger or pain. There is perhaps something in
this idea of "harmonizing our efforts" and "co-operating to
solve social problems".
But back to that report on nutrition.
Here is something more about it also from this same day's
newspaper :
U.N. CHILD FUND TOLD OF NEW FOOD AIDS:
United Nations, N.Y.; Sept. 12 New protein
foods are becoming increasingly available to
benefit the malnourished children of the world,
the Executive Board of the United Nations
Children's Fv.nd heard today.
The prospects for raising nutrition levels in
underdeveloped areas are brightening, the
twenty-six-nation board was told.
Preliminary reports on the project, in which
the children's fund is co-operating with the
World Health Organization and the Food and
Agriculture Organization, were submitted by
spokesmen for each.
Dr. King, an adviser to the Children's Fund,
mentioned the probability of "substantial pro¬
gress" by using high-quality protein foods such as
soybean, cotton seed, sesame seed, peanut and
palm nut products in Africa, Central and South
America, the Near East and India.
Still rather dull: Research. Proteins. Technical problems.
Spokesmen for Specialized Agencies.
Yes, but these spokesmen are talking about the possibility
that something will happen which has never happened be¬
fore a thousand million people may have enough to
eat. Perhaps one can forgive these research specialists paid
by who and fao and unicef for doing rather dull work. A
dozen men from a dozen countries studying how to use soy¬
beans or peanuts perhaps that too is not such a bad way
of harmonizing our efforts.
This then is part of what the U.N. and the other agencies
do: studies, reports.
A centre for harmonizing human efforts must also be a
centre of "intelligence": In time of war,
"intelligence" is an essential activity; it (Cont'd on

it and giving it to the people who need it.

Dear Jenny
(Continued)
In the war against ignorance,
and poverty and disease, we
need intelligence. Going
back to my newspaper, I
read that the tenth annual
meeting of the Board of
Governors of the World Bank
and the Monetary Fund opened in Istanbul yesterday.
It says: both institutions presented optimistic reports about
the world economy. About the world economy! the economic
systems of the whole world! Some people had done a lot
of intelligence work.
In the seemingly dull part of U.N.'s work, I would include
"conferences". To bring people from several countries
together and let them merely talk, that doesn't seem to
amount to much. True, a conference may be on so tech¬
nical a question that only experts can understand what is
being said. True, many a conference has no immediate
practical result that any one can see. There is no reason
why most of us should be particularly interested in a lot of
these conferences. But occasionally, all of us perceive that
a conference may be important. A conference may be a
sign that we yearned for, that the spirit of co-operation
lives and may prevail.
Enshrouded in secrecy and fear
That is how the Geneva conference on the peaceful use
of atomic energy appeared. For ten years we have
heard that nuclear energy may serve to enrich the life
of men. But so far as we could see, the governments that
were spending billions of dollars on developing the use of
nuclear energy were putting that money into bombs. The
destruction of man's life, not its enrichment, seemed to be
the most likely result. All was enshrouded in secrecy and
fear. And now, through the United Nations, they meet, they
talk, they exchange information, vague dreams of enrichment
of man's life take form and substance. Is this the turning
point? It is possible.
What, then, besides conferences and studies and reports?
Three things occur to me. They are: Declarations; Interna¬
tional agreements; and Technical Assistance.
By a Declaration, I mean here a statement on some im¬
portant matter that has been agreed to after careful study
by representatives of different countries. The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is the best known example. It
was drawn up by the Commission on Human Rights, after
months of discussion, and it was "proclaimed" by the General
Assembly on December 10, 1948. It is a short document!
ALL CASTES AND CREEDS receive equal care and treatment at tuber¬
culosis centre, Patna, India one. of two set up by Government of India
with help from World Health Organization and U.N. Children's Fund.
As ¡n most of world, there is a shortage of health workers at Patna. Centre
trains doctors, health visitors, nurses, technicians, provides model T.B.
control service with latest laboratory and X-ray equipment.
UNATIONS
Thirty sections ("Articles") each of only one to four sen¬
tences.
Article 1 reads:
"All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and
rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and
should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood."
Article 2 begins:
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set
forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind,
such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other
status..."
This is Article 9:
"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or
exile", and here is part of Article 26 :
"1. Everyone has the right to education. Education shall
be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.
Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and
professional education shall be made generally available and
higher education . shall be equally accessible to all on the
basis of merit."
Why is this Declaration important, so important that De¬

Day"? The main point, I think, is this: The Declaration sets
some standards for society, and the member countries of the
U.N. have said: "We accept these standards." If men are
subjected to torture, if they are denied fair hearing by im¬
partial tribunals, if they are persecuted for practising their
religion these are only examplea it is no longer an offence
against a few or against the people of one country only it
is an offence against mankind.
To proclaim a standard in itself guarantees no freedom,
restores no liberty, improves no social condition. To pro¬
claim a standard is indeed merely to say some words, and
the words may be ambiguous, and the words may be ignored
and they may be forgotten. Some of the words and phrases
of the Declaration are ambiguous; and no doubt much of it
will often be ignored by governments. But I do not think
these words will be forgotten. They have been spoken on
behalf of all mankind.
I turn next to international agreements. I mean agree¬
ments made by governments that they will follow a certain
course of action, and do whatever is necessary to carry it out.
A single example is an agreement drawn up by Unesco by
which countries undertake to eliminate customs duties on

books, periodicals, newspapers and many types of education¬
al, scientific and cultural materials, twenty countries have
accepted this agreement, and as a result such items are
easier to get and cheaper to buy.
Finally, there is "technical assistance". You know what
is meant by "underdeveloped countries". How can U.N. help
them to develop? Not, at present at least, by giving them
much money. Countries that are better developed have not
come to the point of contributing huge amounts it would
have to be some hundred millions of dollars, at least, I think
which U.N. can give or lend at very low rates of interest
for building schools, hospitals and things like that. For
some kinds of economic development countries can borrow
from the International Bank, of course, and from private
banking organizations. There are many other ways in
which particular countries are helping one another to de¬
velop, economically and socially. But U.N. and the other
agencies are given only a limited amount of money to put
into this kind of work: about twenty-five million dollars a
year (the figure varies from year to year).
It has been decided that the best use of this money is to
help countries get some of the well-trained people they need,
and give a little of the equipment they need. For example,
in health work, who may help a country set up a demonstra¬
tion project, and send a doctor, a sanitary engineer and a
nurse, and give some scholarships for training medical stud¬
ents and public health workers.
The experts from many countries, working in underdevelop¬
ed countries in every continent these are the living
examples of international co-operation to solve social and
economic problems. I read a piece in a Unesco publication
the other day that made the "technical assistance" and in¬
ternational co-operation real and vivid to me. It was a
letter, too. It was written by Mr. Weber, a Dutch expert.
He is working for fao in Uttar Pradesh, India, at the foot of
the Himalayas.
Scorched earth legacy from the past
Writing to a Dutch girl named Hanny, he said: "In
former days there was much fighting in this region
and the rival forces had a bad habit of setting fire
to each other's forests. The result was that the forests
gradually disappeared. The mountains were left bare, the
springs and wells dried up and without water the land
is barren. In the Spring, however, when the snows melt,
and also during the rainy season of June and July, heavy
torrents come rushing down from the mountains; the rivers
flood and the fertile topsoil is washed away. So the slopes
of the mountains are left bare except for cactuses and pine
trees on the rocky subsoil.
"This is the country in which the Paharis live and you
can well imagine that they are anything but rich. That is
why the Government of Uttar Pradesh the State in which
these mountain regions are situated thought it necessary
to help the population and asked for technical assistance
from the United Nations to aid in the many schemes they
have launched for afforestation, land reclamation, commu¬
nity development, etc. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Or¬
ganization sent me out here and now I am joining hands
with the Government and the people to improve their state
of affairs. But all I can do is to give some advice; it is up
to the Paharis to develop their own, country.

Ranikheta small town of 6,000 inhabitants. The
college has some 700 students. They are learning his¬
tory, literature and other interesting subjects, but they
badly want to study chemistry, biology and physics which
will give them the basic :knowledge to develop their country.
Funds for laboratories, however, were not available. So last
year I came back to Holland to tell you and my friends in
the Rotary Clubs what is going on in the Himalayas and to
ask for your help. And you did help ! The students of
Haarlem and the Rotarians collected almost 13,000 florins
(about $3,400 or 16,000 rupees) and Unesco sent the money
to us as Gift Coupons.
"Then things started moving in Ranikhet. On May 11, the
Netherlands Ambassador to India, Baron van Pallandt, came
over to Ranikhet to present the money to the Governor of
Uttar Pradesh.
"For the occasion, the school organized a magnificent
exhibition of Kumaon art, mostly connected with sacred
subjects. We also exhibited that pile of letters from the
Netherlands, together with postcards showing windmills and
tulip fields. Do you realize that the pupils here are so poor
that they cannot spare the money to buy a postage stamp?
I gave them ten rupees, so they'll soon be answering you.
"Now I still have to tell you what is being done with all
the money you collected. Unesco has promised to buy the'
apparatus at special discount and to forward it to India. This
means that every cent, every "kwartje" (quarter of a florin)
will be used for the purpose for which it was meant: to equip
the school's three new laboratories.
"Meanwhile, we have also collected some money here to
erect the laboratory buildings. It's an expensive business,
but volunteers from the Rotary Clubs are going to help the
students with the construction work and that will save money.
What is more, we are getting another 10,000 rupees from the
Indian Government to buy the building materials!bricks,
timber, nails, etc. Thus we shall achieve our aim, thanks to
Unesco, and thanks to the many people in Holland and India
who have helped us so generously."

1955 : Where
do we go
from here?
I have tried to tell you about some of the reasons why the
U.N. was established, and about the arrangements the
countries have made for working together through the
U.N. and related Agencies. I have omitted much. A post¬
script is needed. Where do we stand today?
There hasn't been any magical change. When we set up
an organization, we didn't give it a fairy's wand. A war is
one way the worst way of settling some disputes for a
time. The second world war settled the question whether
Hitler was to rule the world. But the roots of war and
how deep these roots are in us, we do not know are not
destroyed by a war.
Each war adds something to our legacy of hate and fear,
as well as to the immediate misery of living people. The
tensions that existed before it continue, in new forms,
sometimes, and sometimes in more violent forms. So, for
those who dreamed that all would be calm, and that the
United Nations had triumphed, these last ten years have
been a period of disillusionment.
I am not going to take you on a world tour of the points
where disputes have arisen in the last ten years. There are
so many disputed claims, so many old hates and fears, so
many smouldering tensions.
A new Republic was born
Some disputes have been placed before the United Nations,
and peaceful settlements have been reached. Take the
question of the Netherlands and Indonesia as an
example. You know (perhaps!) that the Netherlands (or
Holland) has for many years ruled islands in the Pacific.
(How easily a Westerner like myself says islands in "the
Pacific", as if we were speaking of a few coral reefs! It is
seventy million people we are speaking of). After the war,
the Indonesians sought their independence. There was
misunderstanding and fighting. The United Nations has
helped to bring about a peaceful arrangement, by which an
independent Republic of the United States of Indonesia was
established.
There are different views on the extent to which
difficulties arising between peoples who decide to be
independent and those who govern them are properly to be
examined and acted on by the United Nations. These
difficulties have been, and are, among the most troublesome
of our age. There is no doubt that in this case the United
Nations contributed greatly to a peaceful settlement."
I am bound to speak about what has been called the "cold
war". In these years we have seen the antagonism between
communist and non-communist countries embittered. Each
group has feared any settlement that might strengthen the
other. So no peace settlement dealing with Germany was
reached, and Germans remained divided. Only recently
was an agreement made about Austria. In China a civil
war has had the result that the communists are in power on
the mainland, and the old government is on the island of
Formosa. And this in turn intensified the fears of those
who feared the spread of communism.
Fears felt in communist countries were nourished by some
actions of Western countries: the fact, for example, that
they built bases for military aircraft and formed an
organization to defend one another (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) .
From the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R., came reports that the
construction of atom bombs and hydrogen bombs was
proceeding apace. This intensified the fears of everybody.
In 1950, North Korean forces invaded the Republic of Korea.
The Security Council decided that this was a clear case of
aggression. (The decision was not "vetoed"; U.S.S.R. at
that time was not sending its representative to the Council.)
Armed forces from some countries, but chiefly from U.S.A.,
were sent to Korea. Forces from Communist China later
helped the North Korean army. And the land of the Republic
of Korea was devastated by war. It lasted over three years
before a truce was reached.
The "cold war" and the Korean conflict have led some
people at some time to doubt whether the U.N. was much
use. The permanent members of the Security Council
obviously were not working in full harmony with one
another and what use was the rest of the work of the U.N.
if it could not maintain security?
I can't take this pessimistic view. It seems to be true
just as the Charter assumes that the U.N. cannot enforce
peace by making war against a great power. At least, that
is my conclusion. The enforcement would itself be a
catastrophic war. Therefore, we are in fact still left
depending on the ultimate willingness of the great powers
to refrain from pushing their disputes to the point of war.
The fact remains, however, that the great powers have not
pushed their disputes to the point of war. I don't know, any
more than anyone else, what considerations have influenced
the leading statesmen in various countries. Personally, I
think that at least one consideration is that they earnestly
want to avoid war. And the United Nations, with all the
arrangements I have spoken of, has made it easier to keep
open the doors for discussion and negotiation.
It is not very satisfactory, of course, to say that ultimately
world peace depends on the willingness of a few great
powers to settle their disputes peacefully. But this is the
situation we have to live with. The best we can do is to
make it as easy as possible to settle the disputes peacefully
and to make it less likely that disputes will arise or, if they
arise, that they will not become so bitter as to result in war.
And for that we need the U.N.
Our task, then, is to make settlements among
countries as well as we can, as peacefully as we can, and to
the best of our ability to advance human freedom and social
justice at the same time. It is an endless task, I suppose.
But this is the direction in which we must move and this
is the direction in which we are moving as we work in¬
creasingly together through the United Nations.
Cato had a moral for us
Looking at the work to be done from this point of view,
I stop asking myself: How far has the United Nations
succeeded? The United Nations is not a pupil to whom
I give good marks or bad marks. It is not the United Nations
that is on trial, it is all of us, all governments, all peoples,
ourselves. We can ask, have the members the countries and
their peoples worked together as they ought through the
United Nations? Well-informed people, and those ill-
informed will differ in their opinions people of different
countries will differ about one another!
For my part, when I consider how deeply rooted are the
tensions among people, how passionately and with what
conviction conflicting doctrines are held, I am astonished
rather that the principles and methods of the United
Nations have commanded as much support as they have.
The ideals and principles which are expressed in the
United Nations were not created by the United Nations: they
gave birth to this particular Organization, and I believe that
their strength in human affairs has been thereby increased.
It is late in the life of human society to begin organizing
internationally for world-wide co-operation. But I recall
the answer of eighty-year-old Cato when he was asked:
"Why are you beginning to learn Greek at the age of
eighty?" He replied: "At what other age can I begin?"
We have begun.

SIXTY NATIONS ON 18 ACRES
ON an island by the Atlantic Ocean lies the
world's most unusual independent territory.
It covers only I 8 acres and has a population of
only 3,500 people. Every evening, the inhabitants put
on their hats and coats and spend the night elsewhere,
leaving a handful of guards to watch over it until
morning. No money is minted but the authorities
issue their own postage stamps and their radio
station broadcasts programmes in 25 languages. It
speaks five official languages and sixty national flags
fly in front of the white fence which separates it from
the rest of the island. But it also has its own flag:
a map of the world flanked by olive branches on a
pale blue background. The island, of course, is

42nd Street and First Avenue
U.N. BUILDINGS shown here comprise, from
left to right: the General Assembly Building;
the Conference Area (along the East River) ;
the tall Secretariat building; and the Library.
In December 1946, few of the water¬
front properties facing New York's
busy East River were as unim¬
pressive as the section of cobblestoned
streets, lined with meat-packing hou¬
ses, breweries and run-down tenements,
bounded by 42nd Street, 48th Street
and First Avenue. And few would have
guessed that within nine months all
these buildings would be crashing down
under the hammers and bulldozers of
demolition gangs or that in less than
four years the staff of United Nations
Headquarters would be moving into
their 39-storey office building on the
spot previously occupied by slums and
warehouses.
The transformation was set in mo¬
tion through a dramatic offer
made by John D. Rockefeller, an
American philanthropist and financier,
to purchase the property as a perma¬
nent home for the United Nations. On
December 14, 1946 the U.N. General
Assembly meeting in temporary quar¬
ters at Flushing Meadows, on Long
Island, accepted the offer. Then New
York City bought and gave to the U.N.
the remaining land needed to round
out the Headquarters site as it exists
today. The City also undertook a
$30,000,000 improvement programme in
the immediate area, including the
construction of a tunnel to take First
Avenue traffic underneath what is
today the United Nations Plaza.
Set against the green of trees, grass
and gardens, the group of building
which make up U.N. Headquarters
today has little in common with the
scene it replaced. On the 18 acre site,
now international territory, and the
property of the United Nations, stand
the low-domed Assembly Building,
with its great meeting hall, the tall
glass and marble workshop of the Se¬
cretariat, the long rectangle on the
river side given over largely to confe¬
rence chambers, and the Library
building.
The Secretariat Building, tallest of
the group, consists of 39 storeys
rising 505 feet above street level
and going three storeys underground.
Its exterior facings are of aluminium,
glass and marble. A total of 2,000 tons
of Vermont marble was used to face
the windowles north and south ends of
the building. Fitted with blue-green
glass, each of its 5,400 aluminium
framed windows is specially made to
absorb the heat and reduce solar radia¬
tion. An air-conditioning system of
some 4,000 units allows individual
control of temperature in each room.
delegates area. The chamber of the
Trusteeship Council, designed by Finn
Juhl, of Denmark, combines colour and
fine woods to achieve a light, clean
harmonious effect. Walls are lined
with ash wood which acts as an acous¬
tic baffle. Arnstein Arneberg, of Nor¬
way, who designed the Security Council
Chamber, worked round a mural sym¬
bolizing future peace and freedom
painted by the Norwegian artist Per
Krohg. The walls are marble and the
doors are set in inlay wood.
Second largest building in the U.N.
Headquarters is the home of the
General Assembly, a marble and
limestone building whose low sweeping
lines stand in sharp contrast to the tall
Secretariat Building. The huge audi¬
torium provides seating for 750 dele¬
gates, 270 observers, 234 members of the
press and 800 members of the public.
DESTRUCTION,
RECONSTRUCTION
AND RESURRECTION
Huge mural twenty yards long and near¬
ly four yards high on mankind's struggle
for a lasting peace was painted in the
corridor outside the Trusteeship Council
chamber by the Dominican artist, José
Vela Zanetti. Mural begins with the
destruction of a family and ends with its
resurrection. Concentration camps, air
bombings and all the agony of modern
war are symbolized in the painting, in
centre of which a gigantic four-armed
figure (section shown here) is implanting
the emblem of the United Nations as
keystone in man's reconstruction of a
war-torn world. (UNATIONS)

annual per capita cost to United

With more than 160,000 volumes
on its shelves, the United Na¬

rence centre for current world affairs
and contains complete data on political,
legal, social, economic and geographical

A pneumatic tube rapidly delivers
library materials to the Secretariat

In crowded Manhattan there is a
natural tendency to build on every
available square foot of land. The
U.N. site is a striking exception to this
rule. More than three quarters of its
area is devoted to lawns, landscaping
and gardens. Some 1,500 prize-winning
rose bushes, 175 flowering cherry trees
and a fine group of hawthorns, sweet
gum, pin oaks, sycamore and honey
locust trees have helped to transform
the site into a garden area.
Flowers and trees at the U.N. site
help to bring back a little of the
charm and fragrance that existed
on the East River shoreline three cen¬
turies ago. Turtle Bay, as it was
known in 1640, was fragrant with the
first tobacco crop grown by two English
settlers, George Holmes and Thomas
Hall. They established a plantation
and a residence, but it is recorded that
Hall, a restless individual, sold out to
his partner less than a year later for
"1,600 pounds of tobacco payable from
the crop which George shall make in
1641". The Turtle Bay Farm region
developed into a residential district in
the 19th century.
UN. Member states and many
private asociations and groups
have helped to beautify the
Headquarters. The circular fountain
in front of the Secretariat Building, for
example, is a gift from the children of
the United States and the Territories of
Alaska Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands. A unique feature is the
pattern formed on the bottom of the
pool by bands of crushed white marble
and black stones. The black pebbles
were given by Greece and were gather¬
ed by the women and children of
Rhodes from the island beaches. Other
nations have given paintings, tapestries
and statues. All the green carpets
came from France and all the grey
ones from Great Britain. A Japanese
pagoda with a bell cast from the bronze
coins of 60 countries was given by U.N.
Associations in Japan. Its base and
surrounding floor are faced with marble
from Israel. From Turkey to Australia
and from Ecuador to Iran, each of the
member nations has made its contri¬
bution.
No less than 12 auditoriums and
conference rooms are equipped
with the U.N.'s "'simultaneous

seats is equipped, and turning a dial in
front of them, delegates can hear a
speaker's words interpreted in any of
the U.N.'s five official languages»Eng¬
lish. French, Russian Spanish or
Chinese. Allowing all delegates to hear
at once, the system is a spectacular
time saver. The 66 interpreters who
come from 17 countries are not only
language specialists. To do their job
efficiently they must have a good
knowledge of the subject they are
interpreting.

U.N. - FROM A TO Z
A frank appraisal
A ATOMS: Since Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in 1945, atomic energy has
been linked mostly with the atomic
bomb. But the atom also holds prom¬
ise of boundless benefits for man¬
kind. U. N. has failed to obtain agreement on international
control of atomic energy and on problem of prohibiting
nuclear weapons; this made it difficult to encourage peaceful
use of atomic energy. But in August 1955, U.N. conference
on atoms-for-peace convened scientists from 75 countries
and "demonstrated without doubt" the feasibility of "gen¬
erating electricity by atomic energy." Meeting has been
hailed as having "succeeded beyond all hopes and expecta¬
tions."
AVIATION: Making air travel safe, helping designers
plan better planes, getting international agreement on sig¬
nals and ways of directing air traffic and supervising a
chain of 10 weather ships across the North Atlantic I.C.A.O.
(The U. N. International Civil Aviation Organization) is at
work on these problems. Now has four air agreements in
operation, gives technical assistance on air matters to some
30 countries and co-ordinates regional operating procedures
for air and ground crews.
J BANK: Development loans to
_J countries in Latin America, Europe
and Asia made by U.N. International
Bank number some 450 involving more
than 2,200 million dollars. Loans
used for expansion of electric power facilities, improving
transport systems and import of modern agricultural ma¬
chinery. Bank still hampered, however, by lack of converti¬
bility of some national currencies.
BERLIN:So-called Berlin blockade in 1948 led to dan¬
gerous international situation. U.N. Security Council unable
to take action by reason of use of veto (see Security Council) .
Agreement on lifting blockade made in May 1949 by U.N.
delegates representing France, U.S.S.R., U.K. and U.S.A.
Original contact and discussions took place in U.N. Head¬
quarters.
BURMA: Complaint to U.N. by Burma regarding presence
of "Kuomintang" troops led to action by U.N. General Assem¬
bly in 1953. By October 1954 nearly 7,000 had been evacuated.
c CHARTER:U.N. Charter signed by
representatives of 50 countries in San
Francisco on June 26 1945. This guide
to action for a better world in
direct line of descent from Mag¬
na Carta signed at Runnymede on the Thames, 750 years
before. Tenth anniversary celebrations of Charter signing
held in San Francisco this year. After ten years in force
Charter can be revised, but no definite proposals yet made.
CHILDREN:There are 900 million children in the world
and two-thirds, or 600 million, live in poverty, lack food,
26
clothing and shelter. In nine years UNICEF (U.N. Chil-
drens Fund) has brought aid to millions of these children.
This year more than 32 million children and nursing mothers
in 90 countries and territories are benefiting from UNICEF's
mass health and feeding programmes, 15 million children
are being vaccinated against TB, 8,700,000 children and
mothers are being protected against malaria, 2 million being
treated for yaws, bejel or syphilis and 2,700,000 being fed in
36 different countries.
COLLECTIVE SECURITY. U. N. Charter provides for
armed forces of Member States to be put at disposal of Secu¬
rity Council for peace enforcement. Owing to Big Power
differences agreements never negotiated. Collective action
was taken, however, by Security Council on Korean question
(see Korea).
CRIME: First congress on prevention of crime and treat¬
ment of offenders convened by U.N. in Geneva, August 1955.
Five hundred delegates at international conference laid down
set of standard minimum rules for treatment of prisoners
and prepared way for studies on prevention of juvenile de¬
linquency.
D DEPENDENT PEOPLES:Future of
Libya, Eritrea and Somaliland all
formerly under Italian rule resolved
by U.N. General Assembly after Big
Power failure to reach agreement.
Libya now independent, Eritrea federated with Ethiopia and
Somaliland soon to be independent. Nineteen million people
living in Trust Territories throughout world benefit from
right to send petitions to U.N. Trusteeship Council and from
visits paid by U.N. Trusteeship missions to territories. Pro¬
posals for bettering well-being of these peoples made by
missions to Trusteeship Council. Many proposals already
adopted by Administering Authorities.
DISARMAMENT:Disarmament Commission of U.N. at
work since 1951 trying to find acceptable formula. Little
success so far achieved, but five-power sub-committee after
meetings in London and New York has now narrowed differ¬
ences at current session. Distinct possibility of some measure
of success being achieved.
DISEASE:In 1945 WHO (World Health Organization) was
operating 20 different anti-malaria campaigns throughout
world. Results achieved show practical eradication of ma¬
laria in certain countries. WHO also conducting intensive
campaigns against communicable diseases such as TB, ve¬
nereal infections, polio and yaws with striking results:
Greece with 2 million malaria cases in 1942 only had 50,000
in 1949 after WHO campaign; 100,000 people in Haiti formerly
suffering from yaws now at work again thanks to WHO-
aided anti-yaws measures.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT:
I y U.N.'s Regional Economic Commiss
ions for Europe, Latin America and
Asia provide possibilities for countries
in the various regions to enlarge
trade, break bottlenecks in production and co-operate econo¬
mically for mutual advantage. Practical results illustrated

and steel industries in Latin America seven countries have
iron and steel industry or else are in position to establish
one. Economic development on world scale planned and co¬
ordinated through U.N. Economic and Social Council. U.N.
technical assistance programme for economic development
spans the globe (see under Technical Assistance).
EDUCATION:Two-thirds of world's population lives in
ignorance and in the poverty, ill-health and low standards
which ignorance breeds. Unesco has launched world-wide
campaign against illiteracy, set up network of associated
fundamental education centres. Regional centres now oper¬
ate in Mexico and Egypt. Technical Training courses spon¬
sored or operated in every continent of world. Unesco also
active in raising school leaving age, adult education and
has broad programme for international understanding.
many maternal and child welfare centres operating in
countries where before none existed; assistance in 1954 to
17 nursing schools; direct aid projects for helping physically-
handicapped adults and children in Eastern Europe and
Asia; between 1947 and 1954 award of 4,500 fellowships for
health training work.
HUMAN RIGHTS: Need for international guarantee for
individual human rights recognized in Universal Declaration
adopted by U.N. General Assembly in 1948. U.N. Assembly
called on all member states to "cause it to be disseminated,
displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and
other educational institutions, without distinction based on
the political status of countries and territories." Universal
application has not yet come about. Two human rights co¬
venants laid out in treaty form, i.e. binding on Governments,
drafted by U.N. Human Rights Commission. Little progress
has been made in their adoption.
T7
FOOD: World population is in¬
creasing at about the rate of one per
cent a year which means that 80,000
additional persons have to be fed,
clothed and housed each day of the
year. Increase in the world's food production is urgent.
With advice and help of FAO (Food and Agriculture Or¬
ganization of U.N.) Europe's maize yield increased by a value
of 25 million dollars in five years. Work now in progress on
hybridizing and testing rice seed in Asia under auspices of
International Rice Commission may yield even more fruitful
results. FAO, in common with U.N., now celebrating tenth
anniversary, has issued two world food surveys aimed at
increasing and improving world food supplies. Expert
missions are sent to advise on crop rotation, breeding better
crop strains and other problems vital to food needs of par¬
ticular country. FAO helps underdeveloped countries with
expert advice through U.N. technical assistance programme.
By end 1953, 165 projects had been completed, more than 300
experts from 54 countries were at work in 55 others.
P
GENERAL ASSEMBLY:The U.N.
V. J Assembly first met in London in 1945.
Made up of all member states of the
world organization. Significant dec¬
isions taken by Assembly in¬
clude: partition of Palestine in November 1947; Universal
Declaration of Human Rights in December 1948; first resolu¬
tion on technical assistance for economic development taken
adopted in 1948 ; international co-operation in developing
peaceful uses of atomic energy unanimously adopted in 1954.
GREECE: Greek complaint of aid and assistance given to
Greek guerrillas by neighbouring countries to the north caus¬
ed explosive situation in Balkans. U.N. General Assembly
despatched special committee to investigate frontier incidents
and aid in mediation. Presence of U.N. committee and
observers in frontier areas led to lessening of tension. In
1954 Greece requested recall of remaining observer group in
view of improved situation on northern borders.
I INDIA: (See under Kashmir).
INDONESIA:Hostilities between
Dutch and Indonesion forces brought
to U.N. Security Council in 1947.
Council set up committee of good
offices. Under U.N. committee auspices truce agreement
was signed in 1948. Renewed hostilities broke out at the
end of 1948. Council then recommended establishment of
independent state of Indonesia. Discussions between Dutch
and Indonesians commenced under U.N. committee auspices
in 1949. Later in year full agreement was reached at round
table conference. In September 1950 Indonesia became
member of U.N.
INFORMATION: Increase in scope and quality of press,
radio and film services throughout the world; international
agreements facilitating exchange of books, films and scien¬
tific data, supply of material for press, radio and film design¬
ed to promote international understanding are among free¬
dom of information problems tackled by Unesco (U.N. Edu¬
cational Scientific and Cultural Organization) in course of
past eight years. Positive results show adherence of 12
countries to agreement on exchange of visual and auditory
materials, and 20 countries to the agreement on the importa¬
tion of educational, scientific and cultural materials.
IRAN: In 1946 Iran complained to U.N. Security Council
of U.S.S.R. interference in her internal affairs. Council took
up question and asked for information on progress of nego¬
tiations between two parties. Iran later reported withdrawal
of Soviet forces.
INTERNATIONAL LAW:U.N. Commission on Interna¬
tional Law at work on tricky problems such as territorial
limits and continental shelf. Importance of decisions on
these matters can effect whaling, salvage and national sover¬
eignty over undersea lands.
ITALIAN COLONIES, Libya, Eritrea and Somaliland (see
under dependent peoples).
TT
HEALTH:In 1954, after sixth year
of work, WHO (World Health Or¬
ganization) had participated in 329
major health projects involving 75
different countries. Two-thirds of
world's population still live in "under-developed" areas where
life expectation is only 30 years against 63 years in more
"developed" countries. Positive results of WHO work show
JUVENILE DELINQUENCY: (see

reignty of a small group of islands in the Channel between
England and France. Court is available for consultation by
all U.N. members states, and all other countries subject to
certain provisions.
KKA S H M I R:Indian complaint
brought to U.N. Security Council in
1948 charged that hostile tribes from,
outside the State were receiving aid
from Pakistan. Council set up a
commission which was successful in persuading India and
Pakistan to order a cease fire. Kashmir situation remained
disturbed and U.N. Truce Observation mission with military'
observers still remains in Kashmir to prevent friction between
two sides and supervise cease fire agreement.
U.N. was not successful in arranging for Kashmir plebiscite.
No agreement has yet been reached between India and Paki¬
stan on terms under which plebiscite should be held.
KOREA: Here, for first time in history, collective military
action recommended by an international organization was
successful in hurling back an aggressor and, eventually,
bringing peace to a war-stricken country. Invasion of South
Korea by military forces from North Korea on June 25 1950
was brought to U.N. Security Council. Collective action was
recommended with immediate goal of throwing back aggres¬
sors and ultimately to bring the aggression to an end and to
restore peace and security in area. Eventually armed forces
of 16 U.N. member states, and of Republic of Korea, fighting
under U.N. flag successful in achieving their aim. Toll in
lives and money heavy, particularly for major participating
nation U.S.A.
Long range U.N. purpose in Korea remains: political unifi¬
cation and independence of country achieved through peace¬
ful means. Meanwhile U.N. still has two agencies operating
in Korea. Constructive rehabilitation work done by U.N.
Korean Reconstruction Agency includes: installation of
55,400 spindles in Korean cotton mills by end 1954; 4 million
dollars worth of industrial machinery and materials have
reached Korea to date: three heavy-duty briquetting presses
supplied to alleviate fuel shortage; construction materials
procured for rebuilding Samchok cement plantonly one in
country. In health field UNKRA provides Republic with
fully-equipped and staffed training centre for Korean doctors
and nurses at Taegufamous place-name during the fighting
in Korea, and has also established rehabilitation centre for
physically-handicapped at Tongnae.
T
L A B O U R:ILO (International
Labour Organization), through con¬
ferences consisting of government
representatives, employers and work¬
ers, fights for better labour condi¬
tions. Positive action already taken by ILO during its 36
years history on all aspects of labour relations; particularly
significant results in regard holidays with pay, eight hour
day, protection of wages and freedom of association. Good
living conditions on board ship now enjoyed by seamen
throughout world directly stems from convention adopted
by ILO conference in 1946. This laid down specific measures
to improve standards of accommodation for merchant
seamen.
M METEOROLOGY:At set times
during day and night weathermen
throughout the world take met record¬
ings and spark vast international
chain reaction involving round-the
clock broadcasting, complex telex and teleprinter systems,
codes, charts and all the technical apparatus making up a
modern met service. World co-operation on met information
fostered and sponsored by WMO (World Meteorological Or¬
ganization of U.N.). Technical committees of WMO lay
down standards for weather recording instruments, and
standardized codes and charts. Result: weathermen all send
in reports in agreed international form. WMO also issuing
international cloud atlas containing photos of all types of
clouds observed from poles to tropics.
MIGRATION:Large movements of populations came
about by reason of Second World War. Displaced and re¬
fugees numbered millions. General Assembly of U.N. brought
into existence IRO (International Refugee Organization) in
1946. Agency in- four years life resettled more than one
million displaced persons and refugees, repatriated some
73,000 to their homelands, and gave other forms of assistance
to more than 1,600,000. However, U.N. not successful in li- '
quidating refugee question with result that further refugee
bureau had to be established following dissolution of IRO (see
under refugees).
MINORITIES: U.N. sub-commission at work on problems
related to protection and discrimination against minorities.
Recommendations made on fundamental freedoms in line
with U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
N NARCOTIC S:International
control to limit official import, export
and manufacture of narcotic drugs
for medical and scientific uses super¬
vised by U.N. body. U.N. Narcotics
Drugs commission has also worked out treaty to control dis¬
tribution and production of new synthetic drugs. Controls
also introduced on cultivation of opium. U.N. body keeps
vigilant watch on course of illicit traffic in drugs, and on
national measures to curb it. Narcotic drugs are, neverthe¬
less, indispensable to modern médecine, and used in this way
bring great benefit to mankind.
P PAKISTAN: (see under Kashmir).
.LIBYA: (see under dependent peoples).
PALESTINE:State of Israel crea¬
ted by resolution of U.N. General
Assembly adopted in November 1947.
Tension between Arab countries and
new State led to U.N. action, and Mediator was appointed
by Security Council. First U.N. mediatorCount Folke Ber-
nadotte of Swedenassassinated. Work by successor result¬
ed in general armistice agreement between Israel and Arab
States signed during 1949. Despite U.N. work in Palestine
tension has not lessened and strained relations still hold
between two sides. At present U.N. has Truce Observation
Commission on spot with large staff of military observers,
but U.N. influence has not avoided border clashes and bomb
outrages leading to loss of life on both sides of dangerous
frontier between Israel and Egypt. Conciliation Commission
set up by U.N. General Assembly in 1948 has achieved no
positive results so far.
POSTAL SERVICES:Mail can travel between countries,
across oceans and pass national frontiers by reason of little-
known document called Universal Postal Convention. Regu-

lations of this Convention carried out by U.N. Universal
Postal Union. U.P.U. is responsible for settling postal
accounts between member countries practically speaking all
countries in the world and co-ordinating postal informa¬
tion for international publication. Next world postal congress
of 94 member countries will be held in Ottawa, 1957.
PRISONS: (see under crime).
PRISONERS-OF-WAR:U.N. General Assembly in 1950 and
in 1953 appealed to all Governments holding second world
war prisoners to give them unrestricted opportunity of repa¬
triation. Special U.N. body sought full information concern¬
ing prisoners still detained, and rendered assistance in facili¬
tating repatriation. Positive results achieved by this body
showed that by September 1954 number of repatriations
exceeded 40,000.
P
rV REFUGEES:Following dissolution
_1_ X. of IRO (see under Migration) U. N.
General Assembly appointed a U. N.
High Commissioner for Refugees.
Enormous task facing this new
office was to provide international protection for some two
million refugees. High Commissioner successful in finding
solutions of number of refugee problems: noteworthy ins¬
tance plight of European refugees still remaining in Shanghai
following closure of IRO. In 1953 3,321 re-settled, and in
1954 re-settlement rate running at 500 a quarter. Work
accomplished in co-operation with Inter-Governmental Com¬
mittee for European Migration, a non-U.N. body although
co-operating actively with U.N. agencies on refugee and mi¬
gration problems.
Particular aspect of refugee problem caused by Palestine
conflict in 1948, resulting in exile for nearly one million
Palestinian Arabs. UNRWA (U.N. Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees) , body set up by U. N. General Assem¬
bly now provides rations, health care, education, welfare and
supplementary services for 900,000 Arab refugees. Agency, in
co-operation with local governments, has initiated number of
works projects providing refugee employment. U.N. still not
successful in solving Palestine refugee problem but progress
being made.
ROAD SIGNS: Standard road signs and signals on Eu¬
ropean roads, and network of arteries for international road
traffic now being put into operation following work carried
out by technical committee of U.N. Economic Commission for
Europe. Roads on this international network already being
built or reconstructed to conform to agreed standards for
speed and safety.
c
SECURITY COUNCIL:U. N. body
primarily responsible for maintain-
ance of international peace and secur¬
ity. Success of Council's work largely
negatived by Big Power disagree¬
ment. "Abuse" of so-called veto power substantive matters
to be decided by affirmative vote of seven members, including
concurring votes of permanent members resulted in lack of
definite action on number of important questions.
SCIENCE: International scientific co-operation (see
under Atoms).
SYRIA AND LEBANON:Complaint brought to Security
Council early in 1946 by Governments of Syria and Lebanon
protesting against continued presence of British and French
troops on their territories. Despite use of veto precluding
adoption of resolution Britain and France took action on
majority view and all forces were withdrawn, to satisfaction
of Syria and Lebanon, later same year.
T
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE:
World-wide plan for giving expert
technical assistance to aid economic
development in u n d e r-developed
countries. Expanded programme, in
which U.N. and Specialised Agencies act together, adopted by
U.N. General Assembly in 1949. Results of programme show
unparalleled exchange of knowledge and skills: in 1954 1,584
experts from 63 different countries were at work in practic¬
ally all less developed areas in the world. New type of world
workshop has provided help on development of water
resources, land reclamation, irrigation, consumer problems to
countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Gold Coast, Greece,
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Tanganyika, Yugoslavia. Malaria control
measures have been integrated in national health services of
Afghanistan, Ceylon, India and Thailand as a result of
technical assistance and advice. FAO has advised India and
Ceylon on fishing boat mechanization. Experts supplied by
WMO are establishing up-to-date meteorological services in
Nicaragua, Jordan, the Yemen and Afghanistan. Unesco has
sent social scientists to Haiti and Ceylon, set up fundamental
education centres in Mexico for the Latin American countries
and in Egypt for the Arab States. To date more than 4,500
experts from 70 different nationalities have been provided.
More than 100 countries have received technical aid in one
form or other. U.N. technical assistance can be written
down as a successful cooperative process still in active form.
TRADE AND TARIFFS:Havana Charter on International
Trade, including establishment of an International Trade
Organization indefinitely postponed. But the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a treaty now put
into operation on a provisional basis by more than 35 count¬
ries, embodies much of the commercial policy section of the
Havana Charter. Number of post-war tariff conferences
have resulted in the protection of 58,000 tariff rates, cover¬
ing large part of world's trade. Countries adhering to
GATT share more than 80% of world trade.
TRUST TERRITORIES: (see under Dependent Peoples).
TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL:U. N. body responsible for
examination of reports submitted by Administering Powers
on Trust Territories. Council also accepts petitions from
inhabitants of Trust Territories and examines them in
consultation with Administering Authority. Council bases
its actions on International Trusteeship System which lays
down principles for the advancement of dependent peoples.
TT
U.N. MEMBERSHIP:World organ-
V- J ization now has 60 members, but due
to use of veto power in Security Coun¬
cil membership is still not univ¬
ersal. Fourteen applications for
membership have been vetoed to date in Council. Other
applications have been rejected by lack of sufficient majority.
Question of Chinese representation has plagued U.N. for past
few years. Decision on this difficult question has been regu¬
larly postponed.
W WOMEN:U.N. body on Status of
Women at work for betterment of
position of women in world of today.
Important decisions taken by Com¬
mission on questions such as:
equality of opportunity, voting rights,- and equal pay.

THE CHANCE OF
A SQUARE MEAL
FAO : v food production up 30 °/o '
UNATIONS
EAR OF WHEAT with the motto fiat partis (let there be bread) is the
symbol of the FAO (the Food and Agriculture organization of the United
Nations) and underlines its role in helping to raise living standards,
improve nutrition and increase efficiency of farming, forestry and
fisheries. From Africa, with its primitive form of harvesting, above,
to Sweden, with its highly organized timber industry, right, FAO is
active with advice and aid. Photo, right, ¡s taken from Swedish film,
"Green Gold." Timber resources are indeed green gold. FAO has
reported that world's forests now measure 96 milliard cubic metres.
In 1946, despite wartime casualties,
the number of people to be fed in
the world had risen 10% but world
food production had declined by some
5%. In the early post-war years many
experts predicted mass starvation.
This world food problem of more to eat
for more people faced the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations when it came into existence ten
years ago, in October 1945. Now,
although the world population has risen
as much as 25%, FAO is able to report
in its "State of Food and Agriculture
1955 Review of a Decade" that the
increased rate of food production now
exceeds the upsurge in population
figures.
Because of the technical revolution
which has taken place in agriculture in
the past ten years there has been a
dramatic transformation from the
devastation and threat of famine in
the immediate post-war years to a sit¬
uation where agricultural surpluses in
some countries are once again caus¬
ing anxiety. The FAO report has some
astonishing things to tell about the
technical revolution which has taken
30
place. World use of commercial ferti¬
lizers has almost doubled since 1939;
the number of farm tractors has tripl¬
ed; development of water resources in
under-developed countries has increas¬
ed enormously.
In India, for example, around 5 mil¬
lion hectares of land have been brought
under irrigation in the space of four
years, and in China the rate of deve¬
lopment is about equal. Plant breed¬
ing and seed improvement have led to
increased crop yields and the scientific
use of newer and more potent pestici¬
des have resulted in the saving of
mirions of hectares of grain and root
crops.
Striking news of the results achiev¬
ed by the increasing application of
scientific methods to agriculture are
underlined in the FAO ten-year review.
In round figures the world is now pro¬
ducing 30% more wheat, meat and fats
than it did before the second world
war. Rice, milk and cotton production
has gone up by about 20%, and sugar by
as much as 51%. However, despite
these immense increases, and despite
the fact that there is now 2% more food
available per capita than before the
war and that world food production has
risen by 30% in ten years, there are
still today millions of people who do
not get a square meal.
Weaknesses today are not so much
on the side of production, but rather in
distribution and marketing. While some
countries are now piling up surplus
stocks of wheat, sugar and cotton, peo¬
ple in countries on the other side of the
world lack the self-same things. FAO
points out that the difficulties lying in
the path of equitable world distribution
are many, but four are of paramount
importance: failure of consumption to
keep pace with production with the
consequent emergence of surplus com¬
modity stocks; non-adjustment of agri¬
cultural production to shifting trends
of demand; stagnation of world trade
in agricultural products combined with
obstacles hindering their free movement
between countries, and the low level of
farm incomes in most countries.
Primarily for these reasons the need
for higher levels of production and
consumption in under-developed coun¬
tries is almost as great as ever. But
]]>

UNATIONS
FAO stresses that further increases in
production can be justified only to the
extent that they can be matched by in¬
creases in consumption. Unless pur¬
chasing power is present food sales will
drop. In fact high post-war retail food
prices have tended to restrict food con¬
sumption levels.
Although FAO has, in its anniversary
report, emphasized the world food sit¬
uation, much important news in the
fields of forestry and fisheries is also
given. Annual world fish production
now exceeds 27 million tons, 20% up
on the pre-war output. Most of the
expansion is accounted for by increased
exploitation of established fisheries in
Europe, North America, Japan and the
U.S.S.R. But a completely new post¬
war development is the emergence of
South Africa, Peru, Angola and Chile
as significant fish producers and
exporters. Technological developments
such as the use of echo sounding equip¬
ment for locating schools of fish,
factory ships capable of processing at
sea, and larger and faster ships with
ranges of over 2,000 miles have all aided
in boosting fish production figures.
FAO has some interesting things to
say about the utilization of forest re¬
sources in the past ten years. It is
noteworthy that the world production
figure of roundwoods (logs, pulpwood
and pitprops) has gone up by about
15%, the greatest increase occurring
in the U.S.S.R. One of the most im¬
portant aspects of the timber industry
wood pulp production rose by about
85% between 1946 and 1954, and FAO
forecasts that this year will see new
advances over previous record levels.
In fact, the report asserts "the world
now possesses sufficient fibrous resour¬
ces and the necessary techniques to
sustain any conceivable future rise in
the world's pulp and paper needs".
Backing up this definite statement
FAO points to some astonishing wood
pulp production increases: North
America with 50% over the 1946
figure; U.S.S.R. double the pre-war
figure; Japan with a sevenfold increase
between 1946 and 1954. Significantly,
however, FAO remarks that Europe's
largest paper producer, the U.K.. de¬
pends almost entirely on imports of
wood pulp.
Alongside roundwood and pulp pro
duction there is also news of an in¬
crease in production of wood for in¬
dustrial purposes. FAO stresses that
since the war considerable progress
has been made in all fields of forest
exploitation, and in a more rational
utilization of forest resources. This,
FAO points out, has resulted in a lesser
proportion of the world's forest crop
being burnt as fuel, and a greater pro¬
portion being used industrially.
In its ten-year survey FAO has
shown that much progress has been
made in giving more people more to
eat. A partial success and solution of
the problem originally facing FAO in
1945 has been achieved the need for
food production to rise faster than the
growth in population. But, as FAO
admits, the parallel-prob'em of achiev¬
ing an equitable distribution of world
food supplies has not yet been solved.
Although FAO's first ten years have
seen more rapid and widespread ad¬
vances in the' technical methods of
agriculture, forests, and fisheries than
in any previous decade, much urgent
work still remains to be done before the
world's peoples are fully fed.

POSTMARKED UNITED
NATIONS. NEW YORK'
In 1951, stamps for world-wide circulation were produced
for the first time by an organization of nations whose
aims and ideas for world peace and security are expressed
in the Charter of the United Nations. Prior to this, the right
to issue stamps had been restricted to governments, though
it is true that some international organizations had arranged
with their host governments to use national stamps on which
they had been identified in the design or with a surcharge.
The stamps issued on United Nations Day, 1951 by the newly
set up United Nations Postal Administration sought to stress
the international personality of the U.N. and to serve as
miniature posters displaying its aims and activities on mil¬
lions of letters and packets sent from headquarters and cir¬
culating around the world. Since then, millions of stamp col¬
lectors of all ages and nationalities have added these stamps to
their collection and have become familiar with the work of
the U.N. and its Specialized Agencies. The stamps have be¬
come an important source of revenue to the U.N. over
$1,300,000 gross in just under three years. Their educational
value has been acknowledged and a group known as United
Nations Stamps Clubs exists which publishes its own bulletin,
"The Globe Trotter". Nowadays when general stamp collect¬
ing has become too costly a hobby, collectors have to specialize
on a few countries or perhaps a single continent. Many have
begun to collect stamps, envelopes and postal cancellations
linked with the U.N. such as the special commemorative
stamps issued by different countries in honour of the Orga¬
nization and its Specialized Agencies. By the end of 1952
more than 40 countries had issued such stamps.

British Atomic Energy Authority
It is usually said that the atomic age
began with the explosion at Hiro¬
shima on August 6, 1945. Perhaps
the major achievement of the United
Nations Conference on the Peaceful
Uses of Atomic Energy is that this date
has lost its importance and that the
opening of the Conference ten years la¬
ter, on August 8, 1955, was the real
birthday of the atomic age. On that
day, and in the two weeks of discussions
that followed, the atomic sciences
emerged from wartime secrecy to be
revealed as a great new benefit to hu¬
manity.
Above all, the Conference at Geneva
confirmed the words of President
Eisenhower of the United States to the
General Assembly of the United Na¬
tions on December 8, 1953: "If the fear¬
ful trend of atomic military build-up
can be reversed, this
greatest of destructive
forces can be developed
into a great boon for
the benefit of all man¬
kind... Peaceful power
from atomic energy is
no dream of the future.
That capability, already
proved, is here, today."
So it is. In four countries atomic
furnaces, or "reactors", are already at
work. At Geneva, the Soviet Union
showed photographs, detailed drawings
and a model of its atomic power plant
at Obrinskoye, about 60 miles south¬
west of Moscow which has been generat¬
ing 5,000 kilowatts of electricity for
neighbouring industry since June 27,
1954. The United States put on public
display an actual small reactor with a
steady production of 10 kilowatts of
power that was increased to 100 kilo¬
watts occasionally to show the eerie
blue glow of the pool of clear water
when the rays from the submerged
uranium core penetrate through it.
Canada and the United Kingdom also
showed models, photographs and ope¬
rating details of reactors that are now
in use and of large reactors that will
be producing power for industry in a
year or two. Atomic power on a true
commercial scale will be a reality in
! 1956 when the British power station at
1 Calder Hall in Cumberland goes Into
operation to produce 50,000 kilowatts of
I electricity. By 1965 the United King¬
dom expects to have a dozen in opera¬
tion and producing electricity, and
there will be at least half a dozen
more in Western Europe by then.
The prospects for commercial atomic
power are the brightest in Europe
because easily mined coal is becoming
exhausted and coal prices are already
so high that power from uranium will
probably be cheaper than that from
coal. Much the same is true for water
power. The easily accessible sites for
power dams have already been used
and future dams will be higher in the
mountains, more remote from the
industrial cities, and therefore more
expensive. After some ten years of
experience with atomic power plants,
it is probable that an increasing
number of new power stations will be
atomic.
The United States has more than a

Gerald Wendt

score of reactors but they are all expe¬
rimental, built for testing new designs,
new methods of generating power and
new materials of construction. Some
radical new designs were reported at
Geneva, including one in which the
cooling water is allowed to boil and
form steam which automatically serves
to control the speed of the atomic
reaction and thus has built-in safety.
There is also a reactor which does not
use bars of metallic uranium as fuel
but instead has uranium in solution.
Another form is the "swimming pool"
type where a large pool of water moder¬
ates the neutron flow and at the same
time serves as coolant. The USA is not
in a hurry to select a type for large-
scale power production because, in
competition with cheap local coal, it is
not likely that electricity from the
atom can be any
cheaper. Several large
power stations are ne¬
vertheless now being
built or planned.
There were, however,
scientists from 73 na¬
tions at Geneva, most
of them not yet acti¬
vely engaged in atomic
power researches. And the non-indus¬
trialized countries, who stand to gain
most from the new source of power,
were the most interested in the facts
revealed in the Conference. In general
the underdeveloped countries are poor
in coal and other conventional fuels so
that atomic fuels offer an exciting new
hope of power for the needed industries.
If, as in India, coal is available, it Is re¬
mote from the centres of population and
is either expensive to transport or, in
some cases, cannot be transported in
mi lions of tons because the railway
system is inadequate. Since one ton of
uranium can give as much power as a
million tons of coal, but is easily trans¬
ported, it avoids this obstacle and can
create industries and wealth that will
later justify the expansion of railroad
construction.
Industry springs up
with nuclear power
Nevertheless atomic power will be
slow to develop in such countries
because it is not possible to build
a profitable small atomic reactor.
Building and operating a large one
requires highly trained personnel,
specialized machinery, and at least a
moderate industrial environment to use
the power. The first problem of the
underdeveloped countries in facing the
atomic age is therefore the establish¬
ment of specialized training schools
for atomic scientists and engineers and
of vocational training schools for the
skilled workmen that will be needed.
It is true that atomic power makes
industry possible where it was not
possible before. But this means not
merely entering the atomic age but also
entering the electrical age, the age of
steam and the age of industry and
modern commerce. For this reason
investment in scientific,
technical and . electrical (Cont'd on

" SWIMMING POOL "
WITH A BLUE GLOW
A leading attraction of the atomic
exhibition of the Geneva Atoms for
Peace Conference was a working reactor
from the U.S.A. Standing around the
pool of crystal clear water, faintly blue
and 21 feet deep, visitors could look
down with perfect safety to see the
eerie blue glow of the submerged
uranium core at the bottom. The
shield formed by the water protected
them from harmful radiations. Rods
which run down into water are the
control rods which start or stop the
chain reaction as required.

precede, or at least to accompany
investment in atomic reactors.
The second major subject at the
Geneva conference, aside from the pro¬
mise of atomic power, was the use in
medicine, agriculture and industry of
the radioactive materials that are
produced as by-products in the reactors
and are known as isotopes. There are
many types and they have many uses.
Some, with powerful penetrating rays,
are used in hospitals for the treatment
of cancer and other diseases, and in
industry to take the place of cumber¬
some and expensive x-ray machines
at a small fraction of the cost. Others,
with faint but lasting radiations, are
at work in research laboratories of at
least 46 countries and have become an
indispensable tool for research studies
in chemistry, medicine, biology and
agriculture.
An official of the United States
Atomic Energy Commission estimated
38
that American industry alone is already
saving 100 million dollars a year by the
use of improved processes and machi¬
nery that were developed from new
information supplied by the isotopes.
He estimated that in ten years the
saving would amount to 1,000 million
dollars. Even this figure includes only
savings to the producers and does not
take into account the savings to
consumers in reduced prices and im¬
proved quality of many products. The
atomic reactors produce isotopes in
large quantities so that they are already
available for shipment all over the
world. Thus researches of this type
can be carried on anywhere long before
an atomic reactor is operating locally.
Isotopes reveal the
mysteries of life
One of the first consequences of the
atomic age will be the stimulus to
research in almost all the sciences,
Farming will profit by breeding of new
varieties of plants, better adapted to
local conditions of climate or soil and
eventually to mechanization of the
farms. The food industry will profit by
the sterilization of meats, vegetables
and fruits which will preserve them
without the cost of canning or refri¬
geration. More food will be available
because plant diseases and the vermin
that now destroy enormous quantities
of food will themselves be eliminated
by the use of new powerful radiations.
The use of radioactive isotopes has
already clarified the mysterious series
of chemical reactions by which green
leaves manufacture food out of air and
sunshine and has thus opened the way
to the direct and artificial synthesis of
food.
Health will be improved also because
the processes of life and the physiology
of the human body are rapidly becom¬
ing understood. The fate of food
during digestion, the role of proteins in
nutrition, the reason for the failure of
the internal organs, the causes for the
onset of the weaknesses of old age all
these and many more are emerging
from mystery into science and the
result will be longer and healthier lives.
Another significant feature of the
Geneva Conference was that work in
all these directions was fully and freely
reported with no limitations of impos¬
ed secrecy. Under such conditions
advances made anywhere in the world
almost at once become the property of
all peoples. Geneva re-established the
international republic of science in

which the conquests and discoveries,
the principles and ideas of man's
endless battle with nature are not
nationalist but are both done and used
without regard to political boundaries.
It was, however, a meeting of scien¬
tists talking to each other. It was
powerless to act or to make any plans
for the future. There was much talk
of holding another such international
meeting within two or three years.
There was speculation as to whether a
permanent international atomic energy
agency would be set up, as was proposed
by President Eisenhower in 1953, whose
task it would be to promote the use of
atomic power and to develop the
atomic sciences for the benefit of the
world. These questions were properly
left to the United Nations itself.
Cheap power can bring an
industrial revolution
Yet the Conference did much more
than merely call attention to the
peaceful uses of atomic energy.
It proved that the atomic age is here
now. It generated high hopes for the
coming of power and of industry to
countries that are now lacking in them.
More than this, it generated such
enthusiasm that the pace of develop¬
ment will be greatly accelerated. It
put into clear perspective the present
new prospects of a better standard of
living for at least half the human race.
It marked, in fact, a revolution in the
thinking of scientists and engineers.
Such a revolution cannot be faced
lightly. It will not be possible to ignore
for long, as the scientists had to, the
fact that the consequences to humanity
will be enormous in the years and de¬
cades to come. Plenty of cheap power
means large industrial production in
regions that are now unproductive
and import industrial goods. It
means radical alterations in the
pattern of world trade. It will increase
agricultural production too by making
mechanization possible. New cities
wiil be founded in areas where they are
now impossible, even per¬
haps in the deserts. Ancient (Cont'd on

In the late eighteenth century the

the industrial revolution to England
and Western Europe. The first results
were impressively bad in the develop¬

labour and the exploitation of workers.
Many decades were required to undo
these omissions and make industry a
blessing. This time the revolution can
be foreseen and the economic and so¬
cial readjustments can be guided to the
end that the new power of the atom

tifie vision. There is need for new
principles and inventions in the field
of economics, finance, law and social
and international relations that are as
bold as those of Einstein, Rutherford,
Fermi and others in science. The phy¬
sical concepts of the universe cannot
be radically revised without some revi¬
sion of the human world also. Revision
is, in fact, now under way. But it
requires leadership on the international
plane equal to that shown by the
world's scientists at Geneva.
The promise of atomic power for the
well being of mankind is incalculable.
We are now on the threshold of a new
era for humanity. The next decade
will show whether or not statesmen
and scientists can grasp the great prize
that lies before them.
The immediate demand will be for
modernized education in the countries
that will participate in the atomic age.
Science will, more than ever, be the
fundamental fact of life in that age
and no country that merely superim¬
poses the work of foreign experts on
an unsympathetic culture can profit
by it. From the primary school up¬
wards not only the facts of science but
its outlook and habit of thought need
to be absorbed. The integration of
science with older and classical cul¬
tures is a primary necessity. Thus
Unesco's pioneer work for its member
states in the improvement and expan¬
sion of science teaching faces a larger
challenge than ever.

Letters to the Editor
Sir,
Your recent issue on "How Nations
See the Foreigner" reminded me of
something that may interest readers
because it confirms one of the points
you made.
An International Esperanto Con¬
gress, such as the one at Bologna,
Italy, gives one the impression that
there are no such persons as
foreigners. Esperanto is the only
language used in speeches and
friendly conversation by the 2,000 or so
delegates from 30 countries who
usually attend these annual congresses.
Chatting with another delegate I have
often been unable to identify his
country of origin, or have eventually
discovered that he was... French.
For this reason I approve your idea
of publishing a series of photographs
of foreign "types" who in fact, were all
people from Great Britain. At various
times I have travelled through ten
European countries and I have been
taken for a Swede, an Englishman and
a German far more rarely for a
Frenchman. The word foreigner is
progressively losing its meaning, and
this is all to the good for young people
who nowadays travel more and more
and who manage to correct or even
forget the false stereotypes they may
have had in their minds.
L. Giloteaux
Secretary, Lille-Esperanto,

Sir,
I should like you to know how much
I appreciate being a regular subscriber
to the Unesco Courier, particularly
because it is an international publi¬
cation of authority and well presented.
I am a schoolboy who lives in the
southern tip of Africa. Being com¬
paratively isolated as this part of the
world is, the ideals of the United
Nations have so far been for me, and I
should imagine for many others here
too, just that ideals, which are
wonderful, but which one hardly sees
in action. That was so, until I found
this magazine which I think makes the
ideals of U.N. far less remote and
which so obviously promotes inter¬
national understanding and mutual
interest, through the important in¬
formation it publishes and by giving a
sense of international contact to its
readers. It does for me anyway, and I
hope the Unesco Courier will have a
very long life.
I am 18, and I would like to cor¬
respond with readers of any nationality.
My interests are chiefly music, books,
physical culture, stamps and coins, geo¬
physics, and I want one day to be well-
travelled and to understand the ways
and cultures of people different from
those like myself i.e. of British descent.
I think what I want most is for people
to have the opportunity to live rational¬
ly and fully, with actions based in
reason not in prejudiced belief.

Sir,
On Saturday when I was in a
bookshop I suddenly came across your
magazine. I was attracted by its
striking and beautiful cover, and I
liked the articles very much. I found
the Unesco Courier a good medium
which creates unity.
I also want to have a pen-friend
among other people of the world. I
hope you will help me with foreign
countries through the Unesco Courier.
I am of Indonesian nationality, and
wish to correspond in English, and my
hobbies are postage stamps and post¬
cards, reading and sports.

Sir,
In an issue of the Unesco Courier
published last year and devoted to the
theme "Prisoners are People" a photo¬
graph was published of a courtyard of
an Austrian prison showing barred
windows. The caption stated that this
gloomy building was a Viennese Cor¬
rectional Institute for Juveniles. This
might give the impression that the
institution in question was the Cor¬
rectional Institution for Juvenile De¬
linquents at Kaiserebersdorf near
Vienna, which is under the supervision
of the Federal Ministry for Education.
The courtyard however is in the prison
in the Court of Justice for juvenile
delinquents in Vienna. This prison
serves for the period of imprisonment
on remand for dangerous juvenile
criminals. For safety's sake, our State
as well as other States, cannot abandon
the prison bars on the windows.
Within the last years the Cor¬
rectional Institution for Juvenile De¬
linquents at Kaiserebersdorf has been
perfectly adapted to the modern
methods used in treating juvenile
delinquents. The barred windows have
completely disappeared there.

Sir,
On my return from work this evening
my wife gave me the August Unesco
Courier, which had just arrived, and
remarked that of all our favorite
magazines this one was the most
fascinating. I agree. This is a very
good thing, too, for there Is a crying
need for more human interest material
about U.N. and its problems.
Citizens of all countries must be
shown that the United Nations is more
than dull diplomats arguing before
microphones in marble halls. They
must come to see that the world
organization is all kinds of people, of
every race and creed, working, playing,
studying, praying together for a better
life and a better world. If world
problems demand world solutions and
who can deny that they do the
furtherance of world understanding
through the U.N. and its specialized
agencies is of the most urgent im¬
portance. With its human interest
emphasis the Unesco Courier is a
wonderful start toward that end.

A NOTE TO OUR READERS
It is now almost two years since the Unesco
Courier abandoned its tabloid newspaper size
and adopted the present magazine format.
Since then no effort has been spared by the
Editors to improve the appearance and the
contents of each succeeding issue. New features
and columns have been added, the number of
pages has been increased, and a high quality
whiter paper is now being used both for the
cover in colour and the inside pages. The
response of our readers throughout the world
to these and other improvements has been most
gratifying.
Though the Unesco Courier is a non-profit
publication the present annual subscription
rate of 300 fr. francs, or 6/- no longer even
covers printing and postage costs. It has there¬
fore become necessary to announce an increase
in price. Nevertheless, to permit the Unesco
Courier to continue to reach the widest pos¬
sible number of readers, this increase has been
kept to an absolute minimum.
As of January I, 1956 the new subscription
rate will be 400 French francs, 8/- or S2.00
per year. The per copy rate will be 40 francs,
9d., 20 cents. New subscriptions and renewals
will be accepted at the current rates if post¬
marked not later than December 31, 1955.

From the Unesco Newsroom
MM. URRY IT UP': A year
ago, Unesco put into operation
a scheme to assure speedy and
safe international transit of
scientific instruments. Since
then twenty-two Unesco mem¬
ber states have named nearly
two hundred laboratories as
participants. Under the scheme
a special internationally-recog¬
nized label is attached to ship¬
ments of delicate instruments.
On á red background, the label
carries in black ink Unesco's in¬
signia and the words: "Protec¬
tion: Delicate Measuring In¬
struments". Instruments carry¬
ing this label can be examined
at approved dispatching or re¬
ceiving laboratories rather than
at border points and so avoid
possible damage or delay dur¬
ing customs inspection.
LIBRARIANS GET TO¬
GETHER: The largest and
by far the most important
congress of librarians ever
held took place recently in
Brussels, Belgium, under the
patronage of the Belgian
Government and Unesco.
Eight hundred representa¬
tives of library services from
over forty countries made
plans to co-ordinate action
for improving library and
documentation services.
H :ALTH FELLOWS: The
Wor.n Health Organization has
just granted its two thousandth
fellowship in Europe. Its be¬
nefactor is a Greek gynaecolo¬
gist, Dr. Vyrsllis Samara, who
is using it to study the medical
application of radio isotopes at
the Royal Cancer Hospital in
London. Upon her return to
Greece, after completing her
studies, she will take charge of
the radio isotopes department at
the Alexandra Hospital in
Athens, the first department of
its kind in Greece. The WHO'S
European fellowship programme
began in 1947 and has since
awarded fellowships to health
workers in almost all European
countries.
ARCTIC CIRCLE
SCHOOLS: New measures
to help spread education
among the populations ' of
the Far North have been re¬
ported recently by Sweden
and Norway. One of the
most important was the set¬
ting up of an agricultural
school well beyond the Arctic
Circle at Tana, in Finnmark,
Norway's most northern
province. Since the war, cul¬
tivated land in Finnmark
has increased by fifty per
cent. From Sweden comes
news of the huge success of
a new "book bus" system
that covers the country's far
north. The "book bus" sets
off each month on a tour
through the small Lapp com¬
munities scattered amidst
lakes and mountains. It di¬
stributes books on many to¬
pics, including novels by
Lapp authors and popular
children's books.
E,IARTHQUAKE LOOK¬
OUTS: One of Turkey's worst
problems is earthquakes, which
strike the country almost every
year causing serious damage.
Fighting the problem, the Tur¬
kish Government launched an
ambitious research project that
studies earthquake-resistant
materials for construction, and
also helps in warning people
ahead of time. A Unesco tech¬
nical assistance mission headed
by Japanese seismologist Taka-
hiro Hagiwara has been helping
in the scheme. For the past
two years, Professor Hagi¬
wara has instructed Turkish
school teachers on how to main¬
tain local observation stations
he helped to set up, and how
to use delicate tremor-recording
instruments. The teachers now
send daily reports to Istanbu's
new Seismological Institute, and
this makes at least limited
earthquake prediction possible.
FREEING KNOWLEDGE:
Twenty nations tcday are
operating the Unesco-spon-

ment that exempts books,
newspapers, works of art and
a wide range of other educa¬
tional, scientific and cultural
materials from import duties.
The two latest to apply the
agreement are Belgium and
Spain. For its part, the
United Kingdom has even
extended it to cover some
forty overseas territories.
The agreement also grants
duty-free entry to newsreels,
educational films, sound re¬
cordings, scientific instru¬
ments and articles for the
blind if they are sent to ap¬
proved institutions. Another
thirteen nations have signed
the convention but have not
yet ratified it.

FAO has solved the difficulty
farmers and others encounter
in finding out where to procure
proper seeds. Through the
FAO's new Forest Seed Direc¬
tory, people can select the va¬
rieties they want from among
the two thousand listed, and
then write to one of the sup¬
pliers recommended by the
FAO. In due course they will
get their forestthrough the
mail. The scheme will also
play a useful role in present day
experiments in planting varie¬
ties of trees in countries wnere
they normally do not grow an

"Contemporary Musical Ex¬
periments". Series A is de¬
voted to new means of mu¬
sical expression with tradi¬
tional instruments, while
Series B features examples
of new technical means in
the realm of music. This
undertaking is in addition to
the IMC's two other sets
which also are being issued

MORE TO EAT
World agricultural production has
risen by nearly 30% in ten years, and
the rate of increase of world food
production now outstrips world pop¬
ulation gain. These are two of the
striking facts revealed by the Food
and Agriculture Organization on its
tenth anniversary (see details on
page 30). Despite mechanisation
traditional methods are still used.
Here, Anuk tribesmen from Ethiopia
are seen threshing millet by hand.
