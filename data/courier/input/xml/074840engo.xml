Excavation of a vast temple complex at Choga-Zambil, near Susa, brought to light the statue of a
queen of Elam, an ancient country roughly corresponding to the modern region of Khuzistan, in Iran.
Wrought in bronze in the 13th century B.C., it is life-size (1 m. 29), weighs 1,800 kg. and depicts the
queen in a pleated and embroidered robe. At its base, a cuneiform inscription reads: "I am Napirasu,
wife of Untash-napirisha. May the curse of the great god fall on him who breaks my statue, on him
who mutilates the inscription..." But this warning failed to prevent vandals from decapitating the
statue. Detail shows the folded hands of this regal figure.

By Angel Losada
ANGEL LOSADA, Spanish historian, is a
specialist in the history of Spanish humanism,
particularly two of its major figures, Bartolomé
de Las Casas and Juan Glnés de Sepúlveda.
He has been a professor at Madrid University
and a researcher with Spain's Higher Council
of Scientific Research. Among his many
publications are "Bartolomé de Las Casas a
la luz de la moderna critica histórica ' (Bartolomé
de Las Casas in the light of modern historical
criticism), Madrid, 1970. and two previously
unpublished manuscripts of Las Casas. 'Los
tesoros del Perú" (the treasures of Peru),
Madrid, 1958 and the 'Apologia" in reply to
Sepúlveda, translated Into Spanish from Latin
(Madrid. 1975).
THERE are few figures in history
as controversial as Father Bar¬
tolomé de Las Casas. For some peo¬
ple he was the "Apostle of the In¬
dians", for others, the author of the
anti-Spanish "black legend", and even
before his death he was the subject
of hostile and embittered opinion.
There is no doubt that these conflict¬
ing views are the result of an imper¬
fect understanding of both the man
and his times.
Father Bartolomé lived for 92 years,
and his long and fruitful lifespan can
be divided into four main periods.
Birth and education (1474-1502).
Although we do not know the exact
date of his birth, it is generally
assumed that Las Casas was born in
Seville in 1474. We do know that his
father was a merchant and that he
was a close friend of Christopher
Columbus whom he accompanied on
his second journey to the New World.
It is very probably this which ex
plains his son's keen interest in the
Indies. Bartolomé received his ele¬
mentary and secondary education in
Seville where he studied the humani¬
ties and obtained his bachelor of arts.
This kind of education, frequent
enough in his day and which did not
require him to go to university, qua¬
lified him to receive the tonsure and
take minor orders. As a priest he
could, and did, apply for a post as
"doctrinero" (1) or "auxiliary" to the
preachers in the recently discovered
Indies and he obtained one.
In this first period of his life, then,
Las Casas can be described as an
average Spaniard, outstanding neither
by birth nor education and so emi¬
nently suitable, like so many of his
contemporaries, for the adventure of

Bartolomé de Las Casas
champion
of Indian rights in 16th-century
Spanish America
On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus and his three tiny ships made landfall
off Guanahani, today one of the Bahama Islands. For Spain this marked the start
of an era of discovery, conquest and colonization of what was then known as the
"Indies" but which was soon to be called "America". Left, Columbus and two
of his Spanish fellow-explorers receiving gifts from American Indians, as depicted
a century later by the Flemish engraver Theodore de Bry. In 1 502, Bartolomé de
Las Casas, a young Spanish priest from Seville, arrived In the Indies. He was
to become famous as a champion of the Indians against the abuses of
colonialism. The engraving of Las Casas shown above is based on his only
surviving portrait (see page 7).
a voyage out to the distant New
World. Such beginnings add to the
merit of Las Casas' subsequent
achievement.
Priest and colonist in Central America
first conversion (1502-1522). In
January 1502 Las Casas sailed for the
Indies in an expedition under Nicolas
de Ovando sent by the Court to put
some order into the governing of the
colony. He was also to ensure that
the Indian enjoyed his freedom like a
normal human being and he was to
free him from the exactions, injustices
and even slavery to which the lack of
experience of the Columbuses had
subjected him. The disciplinary aspect
of the expedition was responsible for
the orientation of Las Casas' future
Indian vocation and explains why he
was to devote his life and soul to the
human problem of the Indian.
Las Casas landed in Santo Domingo
(Hispaniola) on April 15, 1502 and for
the first few years his way of life was
in no way different from that of any
other emigrant colonist. Making full
use of native labour he ran the estate
which his father had left him, took
part in the wars which Ovando waged
against rebellious Indians and like any
other "encomendero" (2) had no scru¬
ples in taking full advantage of Indian
labour, something which he was bitterly
to repent later.
In 1510 there landed in Hispaniola
an expedition of four Dominican mis¬
sionaries from Salamanca, centre of
the School of Theologians and Jurists
who were the founders of modern
international law. The expedition was
led by Friar Pedro de Cordoba and
among its members was the famous
Father Antonio Montesinos. The first
sermons of Father Montesinos made a
deep impression on Las Casas.
The colonists' tendency to blur the
distinction between the freedom and
the slavery of the Indians in their ser¬
vice caused the Dominicans to react
immediately and take up the defence
of the Indians.
The Dominican spokesman was the
fiery Antonio Montesinos who, in a
sermon delivered before Admiral Diego
Columbus, son of the Discoverer, and
a group of Royal officials on November
30, 1511 made the first deliberate ma¬
jor public protest against the treatment
being meted out to the Indians by the
colonists. His call for freedom in the
New World for every non-Christian
man and nation marked a decisive
turning point in the history of America.
The main theme of Montesinos' ser¬
mon was that all the colonists were
living and dying in mortal sin because
they were making slaves of the Indians
and compelling them to work for them
as well as waging unjust wars upon
them, and that furthermore they were
failing to carry out their duty as
evangelists.

w Montesinos' words greatly annoyed
* the colonists and authorities on the
island and were not well received at
the Court either. The result was that
the Dominican friar was obliged to
return to Spain. His sermon, however,
unleashed a pro-Indian campaign which
was to affect both men's thinking and
the more practical domain of govern¬
ment institutions. From that West
Indian environment there arose "a Las
Casas, tireless advocate in the Span¬
ish Court of the cause of the In¬
dians" (1).
The Cuban campaigns in which Las

Casas served as military chaplain to
the Governor, Diego Velazquez, were
the decisive element leading to his
conversion. Velazquez had rewarded
him with a rich "grant" of Indians but
the scruples which Montesinos' ser¬
mon had caused in Bartolomé's soul
were increasing.
He resolved to give up the estates
which he farmed with the help of the
Indians and dedicate the rest of his
life to the defence of the Indians. He
then decided to return to Spain and
try and convince the Court of the
urgent need to suppress the abuses of
the "encomiendas" and the wars of
conquest in the Indies.
Las Casas returned to Spain in 1515
and devoted his energies to winning
to his cause the new king, Charles I,
who was also to become the Holy
Roman Emperor Charles V. To this
end he had an interview with the
Regent of the Kingdom, Adrian of
Utrecht, to whom he sent a memoran¬
dum on the distressing situation in the
Indies. Adrian passed the memoran¬
dum on to his Co-Regent, Francisco
Ximénez de Cisneros, Cardinal of
Spain and Archbishop of Toledo, who
immediately took Las Casas seriously
and made him his counsellor for Indian
affairs.
Las Casas was appointed Universal
Protector and Procurator of the Indians
with an annual salary of 100 gold
pesos. (This position of "Protector of
the Indians" was a typical and exclu¬
sive institution of the Spanish Crown as

In 1544, when his persistent efforts
in America had borne fruit. Las Casas,
on the recommendation of Emperor
Charles V, was named by the Pope as
Bishop of Chiapa in what is now the
Mexican state of Chiapas. As bishop
he continued his "great mission", the
peaceful settlement of the region of
Verapaz, a "territory forbidden to the
conquistadores" under the terms of a
concession granted by Charles V.
During his few years as bishop he must
have witnessed scenes similar to those
shown here. Opposite page and

evangelized by Las Casas and his
fellow-missionaries celebrate Holy
Week in the township of Chamula,

for punishment all abuses of the

Las Casas presented Cisneros with
a series of petitions on wrongs, rem¬
edies and accusations in all of which
can be discerned the outlines of a plan
to reform the Indies which implied a
far-reaching revision of the entire
Indian colonization policy. Cisneros
sent a group of three Hieronymite
monks to the Indies to look into the
matter and Las Casas accompanied
them as counsellor.

was serious dissension between Las

k open break and In 1517 Las Casas
* returned to Spain with the intention of
laying his complaints before Cardinal
Cisneros. But the Cardinal had died
on November 8, and Las Casas had
no other course open to him except
: to deal directly with the Spanish king,
: who had just landed in the Peninsula.
A new project to reform the Indies
was prepared and presented to the
Court by Las Casas. Its aim was the
agricultural colonizing of the New
World using skilled farmers recruited
in Castile to teach the Indians the
tried techniques of European farming
(a genuine foretaste of the technical
co-operation projects of our days).
This project completely rejected any
idea of exploiting the Indian and
looked to the consequent Increase in
productivity to supply new sources of
income for the Crown.
The new Las Casas plan advocated,
among other things, the recognition of
equal freedom for the Indian and the
subject from Spain, mixed marriages
between the Spanish colonists and the
Indians (far removed was the mere
thought of racism) and permission for
each family of farmers to take with
them a black slave or a black slave
couple.
This last idea was to become the
first source of scandal for his enemies.
They accuse him of contradiction and
consider him the person responsible
for the implantation of the black slave
market in South America. But the
French historian Marcel Bataillon has
very clearly shown that Las Casas was
not the first person to suggest such a
practice and that, in any case, his
advice had no practical effect. Later,
Las Casas himself, in his "History of
the Indies", bitterly repented of his
idea.
Admission to the' Dominican Order
second conversion (1522-1550). On
May 19, 1520 Las Casas had obtained
from King Charles a settlement of a
strip of coastal land in Venezuela to put
into practice his ideas on peaceful
colonizing with land-workers recruited
in Spain. Unfortunately the experi¬
ment ended in disaster mainly because
of the desertion of many of the farm¬
workers who were ill-prepared for the
venture. Bartolomé was very disap¬
pointed and saddened and decided to
change his way of life and enter the
Dominican Order.
From 1524 to 1530 in the peace and
quiet of his monastery he pursued his
studies in law and theology with great
thoroughness and thought out and
started drafting the originals of his
literary magnum opus. Here we have
the beginnings of the great committed
writer that Las Casas was to become
later in his life.
With this new and enriched stock of
cultural knowledge and the support of
his brothers in religion, Bartolomé
took up the fight once again. He
rightly felt that his way was not that
of the missionary moving among the
pagan Indians, but that made possible
by his access to the Court and even
to the Pope where his ideas on colo¬
nizing and peaceful evangelizing could
be effectively explained. These ideas
can be summarized as follows:
Abolition of the "encomienda"
which would free the Indian from that
state of subjugation to the colonist
which, in Las Casas' opinion, is the
worst form of slavery.
Condemnation of all wars of con¬
quest. The world must be brought to
realize that before the arrival of the
Spaniards the Indians belonged to a
nation as free and sovereign as Spain,
were as intelligent and free as any
other men and, in many ways, were
superior, naturally and morally, to the
colonists. (Rightly may Las Casas be
considered the precursor of the doc¬
trine of the "noble savage".)
The decisive influence of Las Casas
was soon to be felt in the question of
the "encomienda". In 1542 the Crown
promulgated the "New Laws" which
implied purely and simply the abolition
of the "encomienda". Another of the
great ideas advocated by Las Casas
had triumphed.
Consecrated Bishop in Seville in
1544, he was appointed to the, for him,
much desired diocese of Chiapa In
Central America where he was receiv¬
ed in triumph.
Then he immediately began to put
into practice a whole series of mea¬
sures to discipline abuses of the
existing colonial system. He even
brandished the terrible weapon of "re¬
fusal of confession" to any colonist
who had Indians in his service and
went so far as to raise it to the level
of a regulation in a manual of pre¬
cepts entitled Confessionary which he
attempted to circulate as widely as
possible in manuscript form.
This attitude of his naturally brought
him into serious conflict with the
clergy and colonists deeply rooted in
the "Establishment". This, and the
premature repealing of the "New
Laws" in 1545, an indisputable victory
for the colonists, meant a new failure
for his cause. But Las Casas did not
consider his cause to be lost and de¬
cided to leave the New World once
and for all to wage the decisive battle
for the Indian cause in Spain itself.
His campaign in Spain to win
recognition of the Indians' human
rights (1550-1559). The circulating of
the Confessionary was the last straw
for the colonists and aroused their
anger against the Bishop of Chiapa.
They sought a person to defend their
cause at Court and through Hernán
Cortes, among others, they found him
in the person of the new Chronicler
and Confessor of Charles V, the
Cordobán humanist Juan Ginés de
Sepúlveda.
Before the King he denounced the
Confessionary as an attack on Span¬
ish rights in the Indies and in his
Latin treatise, Démocrates the Second
or on the just causes of the war
against the Indians, he defends the
system of "encomiendas" when ap¬
plied without abuse, and the justice of
war against the Indians when they wish
to resist the preaching of the Gospel.
There is no doubt that seen from
our present day viewpoint Las Casas'
refusal to recognize any superiority of
cultures is not only more attractive and
exemplary but is the only just attitude
to take. But even today how far are
we from seeing it effectively accepted
in practice!
What is really surprising is that the
Spain of those days, which allowed a
freedom of speech which even today
arouses our admiration, should remain
divided into two opposing bands; the
supporters of the colonizing policy
advocated by Sepúlveda and the sup¬
porters of the policy favoured by Las
Casas. Between them the Crown
maintained its neutrality.
In view of this state of affairs, Em¬
peror Charles V very prudently decided

to summon a "Council of Theologians
and Jurists" In Valladolid (1550-1551)
to allow the opposing parties to defend
their viewpoints, which was tanta¬
mount to opening a debate on the jus¬
tice of a war which the Emperor
himself was waging in America.
Furthermore, while waiting for the
Council to come to a conclusion the
Crown decided to suspend all wars of
conquest in the New World, and pro¬
ceeded to do so.
To combat the arguments of Sepúl¬
veda (summarized in an Apologia of
his Démocrates the Second) Las Casas
presented and read to the Council a
voluminous treatise also entitled Apo¬
logia. The text of this work lay unpub¬
lished in the National Library In Paris
until we recently sent it to the printer
together with a Spanish translation of
Sepúlveda's Apologia (Editoria Nacio¬
nal, Madrid, 1975).
As for the respect which should be
shown to the pagan religion of the
Indians we can do no better than quote
the following which is a paragraph
from the Apologia:
"Neither cannibalism nor the sacri¬
fice of human victims to the Gods by
the Indians are offences which shall .
justify war being waged against them.
In the first place because such cases
be but rare and in the second place
because the said cannibalism and im¬
molation are an essential part of their
religious rites... A change of religion,
though it be conversion to the true
religion is a matter which shall not be
treated lightly nor in any way be im¬
posed by force, for there is no matter
whatsoever more arduous and impor¬
tant for a man than to abandon his
first religion, even though its rites
include the sacrifice of human vic¬
tims..." (We could almost be reading
a page of Rousseau or Voltaire!)
Las Casas, then, Is proposing a for¬
mula for peaceful co-existence in poli¬
tical and religious matters between all
peoples. He calls for mutual respect
of race, religion and culture as a fore¬
runner of the modern concept of
racial, cultural, political and religious
pluralism.
It is certain that as far as Las Casas
was concerned there was only one true
religion and that was Catholicism, and
yet he maintains his principle that
rather than make war on a nation in
order to convert it to the true religion,
the pagan religion of that nation should
be respected. He goes on to say that
it would be better for the nation to
keep its original religion than be
obliged to adopt another by force.
Here we have the essential differ¬
ence between the doctrine of Las
Casas and that of Sepúlveda and Fran- ,
cisco de Vitoria. The latter claimed I
Revolt against oppression
Las Casas fought unceasingly to bring about the abolition
of the oppressive "encomienda" system, under which the
Spanish Crown "granted" a number of Indians as workers
to Spanish settlers known as "encomenderos". Las Casas'
efforts were crowned with success in 1542 with the
promulgation by the Spanish Crown of the so-called
New Laws, described by American historian Lewis Hanke as
representing "as revolutionary a change in the administration
of Spain's great empire overseas as Las Casas' contemporary,
Nicholas Copernicus, had achieved in astronomical circles."
Above, detail from a Mexican manuscript of the period depicting
an Indian uprising against an "encomendero" and the latter's trial.

^that the sacrifice of innocent victims
by the Indians was sufficient justifi¬
cation for the armed intervention of
Spain in the Indies. For Las Casas
such armed intervention was a greater
violation of natural law than the sacri¬
fice of innocent victims.
Although the Valladolid Council rea¬
ched no definitive decision, it is true,
nevertheless, that the subject and the
opposing positions adopted on it have
had an influence which has lasted to
the present day.
Las Casas' intervention in the affairs
of Peru (writing of "De Thesauris") and
his death (1559-1566). From 1559
onwards Las Casas took a special
interest in the affairs of Peru and
in its colonial system which post¬
dated that of Central America and
which was the prey of civil wars for
a long time. Thus, in 1561 he came
out very strongly in support of the
position adopted by the Bishop of
Charcas, Provincial of the Dominicans
in Peru, Father Domingo de Santo
Tomas, against the perpetuating of the
"encomienda".
He was a nonagenarian when, in
reply to a consultation requested by
the missionaries in Peru, he wrote two
fundamental works. One was written
in Spanish, Las Doce Dudas or Doce
Cuestiones Peruanas (The Twelve
Doubts or Twelve Peruvian Questions,
published in Paris in 1882 by José
Antonio Llórente). The other, in Latin,
De Thesauris, had remained unpub¬
lished until we found the original
manuscript in the Biblioteca de
Palacio, In Madrid, and published it
with a Spanish translation under
the title, Los Tesores del Peru (The
Treasures of Peru; Consejo Superior
de Investigaciones Científicas, Madrid,
1958). Here, Las Casas replies in
detail to the consultation on "the
colonists' right to possess those goods
proceeding from the ransom of Ata-
hualpa (1) and the treasures from the
sepulchres of the Incas".
Las Casas appears here as one of
the first and most ardent defenders of
the notion that each nation has its
own cultural identity. The archaeolo¬
gical and artistic treasures of a nation
are the inalienable property of the
people and if even the prince cannot

soner by the Spanish conquistador Pizarro.
Although a ransom of a roomful of gold and
silver was paid by the Incas, Atahualpa was
executed in 1533.

Member States "for the preservation and
presentation of the cultural and natural heri¬
tage" includes a special programme for Peru:
"Restoration of historical monuments in the
Cuzco-Machu Picchu area...". Las Casas with
his work "The Treasures of Peru" may well
be considered the first advocate of this well
justified campaign.
dispose of them how much less can
they be seized by strangers.
From speaking of artistic treasures
Las Casas passes naturally and imme¬
diately to the subject of human trea¬
sure and for him the greatest treasure
in South America is the Indian who has
to be defended. De Thesauris, the
most perfect work of literature written
by Las Casas in our opinion, can be
considered up-to-date even at the
present time (2). This book, which he
considered to be his last will and
testament and which he presented as
such to King Philip II, marks the end
of Las Casas' literary activity.
Las Casas died on July 17 (or per¬
haps July 18) 1566 in the Convent of
Our Lady of Atocha in Madrid. He
was 92 years of age. According to the
Chronicler Father Gabriel de Cepeda,
being on the point of departing this
world, with the candle in his hand,
Las Casas begged everyone not to
cease to protect the Indians and,
repenting that he himself had not done
for them everything that was necess¬
ary, he implored them to help rectify
this omission.
Shortly afterwards (May 6, 1567) the
Council of the Indies solemnly granted
their freedom to the Indians at Coban,
the first posthumous victory of the
"Apostle of the Indians" and one which
was to be followed by so many others
right up to the present day.
Angel Losada
Las Casas vigorously denounced the
cruelty and injustice which the greed of
the conquistadores had brought to
America, (as depicted in engraving by
Theodore de Bry, opposite page)
and used every possible argument
to support his fight for justice.
But alongside these injustices and this
cruelty, inherent in all forms of colonialism,
positive developments were taking place,
due in many cases to the efforts of
Spanish missionaries. Colleges
and universities were founded
(the university of Mexico City was set
up on Las Casas' initiative in 1533, four
years after the end of the Spanish
conquest) ; printing was introduced,
along with European farming and
industrial techniques; towns were built,
etc. In the words of the Mexican
historian Ramon Xirau, "in the conquest
of America were intermingled utopia
and "encomienda", deeds and laws, wars
and missionary work, aggression and the
desire to build a new City of God."
Las Casas, and other Spaniards who
defended the rights of the Indians,
symbolize this positive aspect of the
Spanish colonization of America. Above,

, prophetic element, which is apparent
when he warns the King of the evil
-which might befall Spain, through the
will of God, for having neglected its
divine task to protect and Christianize
the Indians. Secondly we have the
messianic element: Las Casas consi¬
dered that he had been designated to
fulfill a divine mission in the Indies. In
third place we have the millenial ele¬
ment which inspired Las Casas to await
the coming of the spiritual Jerusalem,
that perfect and definitive society
which stands apart from history and
which in the fullness of time brings it
to an end by divine ordinance.
There is no doubt that there are
elements of all this in Las Casas'
thought but they are a very small part
of his work and are in no way typical
of the whole.
I think that the best word to describe
Las Casas is Utopian. He wanted to
see his reforms put into practice im¬
mediately and without delay, that is,
within the framework of our present
world with human means and for
human ends. To a large extent these
reforms dealt with social and economic
questions and implied a reorganization
of society to achieve the proposed
ends.
Las Casas insisted on presenting the
objectives of his political government
with terms such as "spiritual and
temporal utility", "prosperity", which
he believed he had found among In¬
dians ruled by their original govern¬
ments, "temporal happiness" values
which seem to anticipate the ideas of
18th century Enlightenment.
His aim was to attain a temporal and
reasonable "order" or system of gov¬
ernment. When he states that the
aim to be pursued by any govern¬
ment of the Indians is the "good and
usefulness and prosperity and growth"
of the Indians, he manages to define
the general aim of political society.
There is no doubt that Las Casas
considered evangelization very impor¬
tant, because he knew that when he
used the gospel as the basis for his
arguments it made it very embarrass¬
ing for his opponents to disagree with
him. But Las Casas always sought
the well-being and the preservation and
the enrichment of the Indian. He want¬
ed to see the poor and the modest
gain wealth and the craftsmen and
labourers who came from Spain im¬
prove their lot. Perhaps the prime
objective of his struggles was to at¬
tain a temporal society with earthly
values.
He proposed new models to correct
and improve this society and some of
them, it has been suggested, reflect
the influence of Thomas More. He
was particularly interested in societies
based on farm-workers, societies with
an agricultural economy but which had
a place for craftsmen, merchants,
magistrates and even soldiers. He
paid particular attention to the rela¬
tions between the Indians and the
Spaniards and advocated racial inter¬
mingling which would give rise to a
new type of society.
I think that It would be true to say
that all of the Utopias which came out
of 16th century Europe were influenc¬
ed by the major economic transforma¬
tions which were part of the Renais¬
sance. Las Casas' starting point was
his direct experience of the economic
upheavals that had caused the ruin
and destruction of many nations.
Las Casas was fully aware of the
situation of the small farm-labourers
and day-workers of Castile, deprived
of their land and crushed by heavy
burdens. In his plans for the Indies
these wretched souls would find an
opportunity to own a "more free and
fortunate" piece of land.
Las Casas had an acute social con¬
science, he was distressed by the
destruction of the Indians' ownership
system and was upset by the unjust
payment that they received for their
work: "let the day's wage be according
to the day's work", he reminds us in
his treatise Among the Remedies. He.
was shocked by the harsh treatment
the Indians were subjected to and by
the acts depriving them of their land
which left them on the verge of star¬
vation and extermination. He realized
that there were two major causes for
this state of affairs: the introduction
of money and everything it brought
with it.
Las Casas attributed the actions of
the Spaniards in the Americas to a
large extent to the lust for money
and riches. "Money", he said, "has
become an end in itself". The desire
for wealth and riches had become so
intense that it had led to a degree
of covetousness never known before,
to the point where it was considered
"blessedness and happiness".
For Las Casas it was the root of all
the evil attributed to the Spanish
colonists. In his book Among the
Remedies, he placed the theme of
covetousness far and above all other
reasons for the Spanish colonization
of the Americas. "All those who do
rise and go to the Indies", he wrote,
"are poor and covetous men and are
moved to go there by nought but
covetousness and the yearning not just
to escape poverty but to become rich,
and not just rich but more opulentiy
so with such riches as were in times
past neither thought possible nor
dreamed of..."
It is easy to understand the over¬
all condemnation which, as a moralise
and Utopian, our inflexible friar pro¬
nounces: "for this cause is the whole
of Spain corrupted and infected by
covetousness and avarice."
The Utopians start out by recognizing
the existence of a state of society un¬
favourable for the weak who groan
under the burden of the wealth of the
powerful and the covetousness of
those who wish to rise in the social
scale and ennoble themselves. Las
Casas started from the same point
and made an analysis of the subject
of ownership, at a time when it was
already noted that the possession of
goods was the basis for the develop¬
ment of the person and that the great
divisions of society would be accord¬
ing to the extent of one's possessions.
These Utopian systems combined
certain pre-Socialist notions with a res¬
pect for the property of the small man
and the middle-class man and were
used to defend the idea of bourgeois
property (which, to establish itself,
used arguments very similar to those
which would later be used by the
proletariat in the 19th century) and,
furthermore, the Socialist schools of
thought could point to these Utopians
as antecedents for their own doctrines.
This is what happened with Thomas
More and Rousseau.

pathy for common ownership and in
whose organization plans there are

always elements of a community type,
fought the amassing of riches by the
powerful but defended the holding of
private property by the Indians and
small farm-labourers settled in the new
continent.
For Las Casas, God had created all
things free and without an owner so
that all men could make use of them.
Originally, then, everything belonged
to the community. But if anyone can
make use of a thing, then that implies
that he can appropriate it for his own
use, therefore possession is the legi¬
timate title to ownership.
The Indians who were the first to
settle on American soil were the
rightful owners of the land and not
the lords and masters later Imposed
on them. This right of original owner¬
ship was applicable, Las Casas said,
to all men, be they Christian or not,
for this was one of the aspects of civil
life which religion could in no way
alter. Therefore all grants, gifts, sales,
etc. of Indian property by the Spanish
kings were illegal and ought to be
annulled.
Las Casas did not go so far as to
apply this thesis to the land gifts made
by the kings to the nobles in Spain
but he sought to attract the poor farm-
labourers away from the Peninsula by
offering them prospects of free land
in America and by telling them that
the Indians had occupied vast expanses
of land which they could not work
alone. He indicated that the Indians
would let them have part of these
lands or else would take them as com¬
panions or associates to work the land
jointly.
Las Casas not only laid down rigo¬
rous principles of private property but
also proposed certain forms of col¬
lective exploitation in mining and agri¬
culture. His fondness for the myth
of the "noble savage", which he devel¬
oped long before the philosophers of
the 18th century, led him to view fa¬
vourably a stage of primitive Commu¬
nism, dear to 16th century Utopianism.
But the most important principle for
Las Casas was that of freedom. It
underpinned all his thinking and ideas.
Las Casas saw freedom as the funda¬
mental answer for problems of human
interrelationships and coexistence.
Freedom, Las Casas said, touches on
everything in human life. To be a man
and to be free are complementary con¬
cepts. From his beginnings, by his
very nature man is free. And this,
Las Casas believed, was also applica¬
ble to the Indians.
In his Petition of Remedies (1516),
Las Casas wrote that "those Indians
are men and free and must be treated
as men and free".
Freedom is an essential element of
human nature and cannot be set aside
or abolished, nor can it be lost. No
one can remove it. In truth (save very
exceptionally in cases where an excep¬
tional offence has been committed and
in virtue of the lawful application of
penal justice) there is no power on
earth that can take away the freedom
of free men. By no one, not even
by themselves "can they be deprived
of that freedom which Is theirs by
natural law" (Petition of 1543).
Moreover, no one can renounce free¬
dom even voluntarily since freedom
is an Integral part .of the human condi¬
tion. Though people may resolve of
their own free will to lower their estate
and abandon their condition as free
men "yet would their will be null and
void and impossible to do". In sup¬
port of this thesis, Las Casas clinches
the case with the following argument:
if a group is to form a political com¬
munity, if it is to be a nation, its mem¬
bers must be free people for "if they
are not free they cannot be part of a
nation".
It is interesting to note that this
judgement on the value of freedom is
found in another 16th century "Uto¬
pian" book, Don Quixote, by Miguel
de Cervantes. Las Casas declares
that "since freedom is the most pre¬
cious and supreme of all the goods of
this temporal world and is so loved and
held in esteem by all creatures both
sensitive and insensitive and much
more so by rational ones" (Among the
Remedies) then any attempt to settle
the cruel situation of the Indians must
start by "setting them free for with¬
out freedom no solution is good".
Las Casas was speaking of freedom
as a universal postulate applying to
all mankind. So that when he spoke

Oceania
A Unesco travelling exhibition
reveals the creative talent
of the Pacific islanders
The "Unesco Courier" presents
on the following pages different
aspects of "The Art of Oceania",
the eleventh travelling exhibition
organized by Unesco in its pro¬
gramme for the international cir¬
culation of cultural works. The
exhibition, a vivid artistic "por¬
trait" of the enormous scatter of
islands in the Oceanic zone of
the south Pacific, will be display¬
ed in different parts of the world
after being first shown in Sydney,
Australia, in May 1975. It was
compiled by the author of the
article published here. New Zea¬
land anthropologist Dr. Roger S.
Duff, Director of the Canterbury
Museum, Christchurch, New Zea¬
land, in association with Stuart
Park, Director of the Otago Mu¬
seum, Otago, New Zealand. The
Unesco exhibition was designed
by the Austrian graphic artist
Freimut Steiger, who has also ex¬
ecuted the layout of these pages
devoted to the art of Oceania.
Oceania's
10.000 islands
The power and beauty and variety of
the applied arts of Oceania are an
expression of the creative genius that
can be shown by even the smallest
and most isolated of human commu¬
nities.
No one who has studied the region
can fail to be impressed by the
settlement of the successive zones of
Oceania, which was essentially a series
of one-way voyages Into the outer
space of the world's greatest ocean.
The region is divided here into three
great cultural areas: New Guinea-Mela¬
nesia, from West Irian to New Cale¬
donia; Micronesia, from Palau to the
Gilberts; and Polynesia, so vast that
Its west-east axis runs from Fiji to
Easter Island, its north-south axis from
Hawaii to New Zealand.
Throughout the region there was
"no sort of iron" (to quote Cook, the
British explorer, referring to the Poly¬
nesian Tahitians of 1769), and we
constantly marvel at the technical
achievement of Oceanic material cul¬
ture in a world without metal.
Pottery was absent over the greater
part of Polynesia and Micronesia, re¬
maining viable only in or within reach
of the chain of the continental rock
clays of Melanesia. In those many
atolls without stone the basic carpen¬
ter's adze blade had to be ground
down from the shell of the giant reef-
clam.
Agriculture was at the pre-cereal
stage, without plough or oxen, and
husbandry was without grazing animals
of any sort. The coconut had originally
to be brought in by canoe and planted
out along the barren strand. So too
was the breadfruit, the paper mulberry,
the banana, the sugar cane, the taro
lily, the sweet potato, the Lagenaria
gourd and others.
It might be said that the Oceanic
peoples were "castaways", miraculous¬
ly able to survive on desert islands.
In the world context the cultures of the
islands of Oceania are seen to be an
extension of the Austronesian Neolithic
of south-east Asia in the second or
third millennia B.C.
The Malayan language complex
remains as the most enduring evidence
of this expansion today, representing
the world's largest cultural area of a
common language, linking Madagascar
(Malagasy), Malayo-Indonesia, the Phi¬
lippines, Formosa, Melanesia, Micro¬
nesia and Polynesia.
While excitingly vtried and of often
macabre artistic power, the applied
arts of New Guinea-Melanesia reflect
the assumed Austronesian prototype
somewhat fitfully. For this we need to
turn to the two remaining areas, Micro-

k nesia and Polynesia, where the original
Austronesians found their way to empty
islands, on which they could establish
viable cultural offshoots.
The word which most adequately
characterizes New Guinea-Melanesia
is "diversity" in language and in way
of life. In New Guinea alone there are
some 500 entirely different languages,
one-sixth of all the languages spoken
in the world. In some parts a group
would be unable to understand the
speech of their neighbours in another
valley only thirty kilometres away.
From island to island, from coast
to highlands and from valley to valley,
the dress, housing, art and ideas of
the people can differ markedly. Yet in
all this diversity, one finds certain
themes and Ideas which are wide¬
spread: the importance of pigs as a
food item, a source of wealth and of
prestige; the attitudes to the dead, who
are believed to play an important role
In the lives of the living; and the conti¬
nual struggle for power, whether this
be through warfare, through oratory
or through the acquisition of wealth.
The earliest human occupation in
New Guinea has been dated to around
25,000 B.C. The earliest dated expan¬
sion of peoples into the other Mela-
nesian islands comes at about 3,000
B.C.
Most of the archaeological work
in Melanesia to date has concentrated
on the study of pottery, and especially
on a particular type of pottery known
as "Lapita" ware, after the site in New
Caledonia where it was first excavated.
Lapita pottery has usually been recog¬
nized by the distinctive style of
impressed decoration it bears, but the
fabric of the ware itself can be distin¬
guished from other types of pottery,
so that it is possible to recognize
"plain" Lapita.
Archaeologists have been particu¬
larly interested In the makers of Lapita
pottery because it is believed that they
are responsible, at least in part, for
the origin of the Polynesians. They
seem to have moved through the Mela-
nesian island chain between about
1200 and 200 B.C., living in coastal
areas or on offshore islands.
There is still considerable schol¬
arly debate over the exact route taken
by the settlers of Polynesia. While
the Lapita potters are certainly ances¬
tral to the later Polynesian peoples,
there is also very strong evidence that
people bearing elements of Polynesian
culture entered the Pacific by means
of the northerly route through Micro¬
nesia.
Because the great majority of the
islands are small coral atolls, Microne¬
sia is properly called the cultural area
of "small islands". Life in the low
atolls was a constant struggle for exis
tence, made tolerable only by the main¬
tenance of trade contacts through the
development of the fastest and most
advanced sailing canoes in Oceania.
The key lay, of necessity, in the
absence of timber large enough to
sacrifice for a dug-out hull, in lashing
small planklike pieces edge to edge
in carvel style to produce a knife-edged
hull. This, with an outrigger float to
windward and a balance platform to
leeward, needed only the reversible
sail rig to become the fastest sailing
platform in the world.
The same skills of precision joinery
were applied to the houses of Micro¬
nesia. Dwelling-houses were roomy
and functional, while the ceremonial
houses of Palau and the western
islands could seat several hundred
people. The handsome Palau club¬
houses (rubak-bai) set on foundations
and framework of adzed beams, had
front and back porches protected by
shaped and painted boards. Boat-
houses were an important third class
noted for spaciousness and elegance.
One of the most distinctive cultural
links between eastern Micronesia and
Polynesia is the legend of the culture-
hero Maui, the ancestor of "a thousand
tricks", who fished up Islands. What
was thought to be his original fish¬
hook was the subject of dispute by
the ¡slanders. Polynesian fish-hooks
and harpoons undoubtedly came from
Micronesia.
The name Polynesia ("many Is¬
lands") is hardly adequate to describe ^
the enormous scatter of islands within r

Pacific island canoes
Polynesia. Suspended in the void of
the Pacific Ocean, its western and
eastern borders equidistant from Asia
and America respectively, its southern
boundary midway between equator and
pole, the Polynesian "triangle" with its
scattered Islands occupies the most
inaccessible part of the habitable world
and the last to be settled by man.
As in Micronesia, this settlement
was made possible only with the dev¬
elopment in south-east Asia of stable
sailing canoes, with a sail rig enabling
them to' beat Into the prevailing trade
winds, which, for that majority of Poly¬
nesian groups lying south of the equa¬
tor, blow from the south-east.
This northern ocean highway could
well have been the route of entry of
those cultural complexes exclusively
shared by Micronesia and Polynesia,
shown in canoes and navigation, fish¬
ing devices, houses and house furnish¬
ings, canoe sheds, tattooing, basic
costume styles of breech-clout and kilt,
and in austerity in applied art.
For pottery, which became perma¬
nently established in Fiji and which
was present in Samoa as early as the
first millennium B.C. and in use for a
thousand years in Tonga, we must look
to the earlier island-hopping route, the
southern route skirting the northern
borders of New Guinea and Melanesia
to the Santa Cruz group now seen to
be emerging as a key staging-point,
and with Fiji as the point of entry into
Polynesia.
All skilled craftsmanship, from
house-building to tattooing, was car¬
ried out by a class of experts known
as tohunga (or the dialect variants of
this New Zealand Maori term).
In the more favoured groups of high
islands in tropical Polynesia, elegant
houses were built on a pole-and-thatch

The word tattoo is of
Polynesian origin and the
practice of tattooing the body
was once virtually universal
in Polynesia, the pigment
being pricked into the skin
in a variety of patterns with
bone-chisels tapped with a
light mallet. In Samoa
youths are still tattooed
today on attaining manhood.

preserve the mortal likeness of the
deceased. Maoris succeeded in pre¬
serving the hair and features by steam,
heating the head in an earth oven.
Marquesans covered the skull with
bark cloth, painted to represent the
tattooed face. Easter Islanders repre¬
sented ancestors by sculptured wood¬
en figurines representing emaciated
men and women past child-bearing
and the sole wooden sculpture known
from the Chatham Islands emphasizes
the ancestor's protruding ribs and col¬
lapsed stomach.
Rivalry among clan and family
groups in erecting commemorative
sculptures of ancestors seems one
reason for the giant images of Easter
Island, which have attracted world
attention and given rise to theories of
an introduction from South America. A
more cautious theory is to regard the
practice as an elaboration of the East
Polynesian complex of the courtyard
temple (marae) found in all tropical
groups from the Cook Islands to
Hawaii.
Under population pressure the
needs of competing tribes inevitably
led to warfare, which became endemic
in Fiji, New Zealand, Easter Island and
the Marquesas in particular. Chronic
warfare was associated with canniba¬
lism, head-hunting and the use of the
enemy bones for fish-hooks and utili¬
tarian utensils.
To meet the preference for hand-to-
hand combat, weapons comprised
wooden spears, a class of spear-clubs
used like a quarter-staff, two-handed
clubs, wooden daggers and the one-
handed stabbing club (patu) of New
Zealand and Easter Island.
By tacit agreement the bow was
outlawed in warfare; it was used in
Tahiti only in archery sport and in
Samoa for shooting birds and .rats.
The unwieldy size of the standard club
from the Marquesas reminds us of the
frequently ceremonial nature of Poly¬
nesian warfare, where nominated cham¬
pions decided the issue in single com¬
bat before an audience of dancing
supporters.

Modern graphic artists of New Guinea
On this double page we present six
etchings executed by contemporary
artists of New Guinea taught and
guided by Rolf Italiaander, a Dutch
writer and ethnologist whose travels
throughout the world have inspired
him to study the relationship between
traditional folk culture and modern art.
In 1972 In New Guinea he repeated
an experiment he had carried out in
1953 in Poto Poto, near Brazzaville
(Congo), where he taught the tech¬
niques of dry point etching to
Congolese artists who produced 82
remarkable etchings, today In the
Museum of Modern Art, in Paris.
Rolf Italiaander's experiments in
New Guinea took place in Lae, a big
port on the island's east coast, In

Goroka in the highlands, and in
villages of the Sepik region, where he
encouraged local artists to acquire
the skills of copperplate engraving.
The artists quickly mastered this tech¬
nique, which was absolutely new to
them. "When I told them they could
first make a design in pencil If they
wished," says Italiaander, "most of
them refused, saying that they knew in
advance exactly what they were going
to do." The 41 etchings made by
these artists reveal their profound
awareness of their cultural identity;
they depict the world around them
animals, flowers, dwellings, their way
of life, customs using a distinctive
symbolism and a style which, while
retaining its links with tradition,

displays vitality and originality. The
subjects of the etchings show how the
artists have remained rooted in their
traditional world: "Wabag house of
the Enga people", "My forefather the
cannibal", "What a young man must
give to his bride", "Fabulous animals",
etc. Many of the artists gave written
explanations of their works, but the
etchings provide such a rich and vivid
picture of life that they speak for
themselves.

Do we have
the teachers we need
for higher education ?
by Dragoljub Najman
DRAGOLJUB NAJMAN of Yugoslavia is
Director of Unesco's Department of Higher
Education and Training of Educational Personnel.
He has written many articles and has published
two books on educational problems. He exam¬
ines the subject of the present article more
fully in his book " L'enseignement supérieur,
pour quoi faire ? ' (What's the purpose of higher
education?), published by Fayard, Paris. 1974.
His study "Education in Africa What Next?"
was published in English by Editions Maison-
neuve, Paris, in 1972.
ONE may sometimes wonder
what connexion, if any, some
of the people who teach in higher edu¬
cation have with real life and society.
How many of those in faculties of arts
and sciences responsible for training
secondary school teachers have them¬
selves actually taught In secondary
schools? How many of those who
teach economics have played an active
part in the preparation of five-year,
four-year or annual economic develop¬
ment plans?
How many of those who teach in
schools of engineering have ever been
In charge of factory workshops or
building sites? How many of those
who teach law also practise it, albeit
only on a part-time basis?

teachers who claim an unchallenged
right to have the final' say on all forms

A critical look
at conservatism
in the world's
universities
university teachers. We must not
forget that in many institutions of
higher learning their position is far
from clear-cut since they are regularly
called upon to do totally different tasks
at one and the same time: to carry
out research work, deliver their
lectures and teach in class, as well as
act as supervisors and trainers of
future generations of scholars and
scientists.
I believe there can be no real reform
of higher education unless a radical
change is made in the selection and
composition of the teaching staff.
The doors should be Immediately
opened wide to those who, although
they may not possess degrees or
doctorates, nevertheless have vast
experience In their own specialities.
Vigorous action is needed to ensure
that teaching staff are recruited solely
on the basis of competence, even if it
means recruiting part-time staff.
At present it is possible to pass
from nursery to primary school, then
from secondary school to university
and to be awarded a doctorate, and
finally to become a teacher without
ever having had any real contact with
life. If we really wish education,
higher education in particular, to
become something other than a self-
perpetuating process of this kind, it is
essential and urgent that people with
completely different backgrounds and
qualifications should be drawn into the
teaching profession.
Students and student behaviour are
widely criticized. It is claimed that
they are cut off from society and do
nothing but criticize it. Studies and
newspaper articles point out at length
how difficult it is for them to adapt
to the needs of society when they
leave university. At the same time,
the training of men and women who
will have to do important jobs and
shoulder heavy responsibilities is
entrusted to those who are in many
cases out of touch with the economic,
social and political realities of life in
their own countries.
It would be impossible to change the V
On achieving independence
in 1960, Mali faced the urgent
problem of training specialized
personnel needed for its deve¬
lopment. "Not wishing to fol¬
low the example of countries
which set up universities co¬
pied from foreign models",
writes the author of our arti¬
cle, Dragoljub Najman, in his
book "L'Enseignement supé¬
rieur pour quoi faire ?" (What's
the purpose of higher educa¬
tion ?). " Mali decided to set
up a higher education system
fully adapted to existing condi¬
tions and able to meet its im¬
mediate needs for trained
personnel."The first institution
created along these lines was
the Bamako training college
for secondary school teachers
(photos left). In addition to
training secondary teachers

college provides courses in
these fields for students en¬
tering other professions.

k whole of the teaching staff in all the
world's institutions of higher education
overnight. No one would want to do
this, and I am certainly not suggesting
it. But now it is becoming both
essential and urgent to Include on the
teaching staff people drawn directly
from working life.
I would stress the point that such
persons should only have part-time
teaching jobs, since I consider it
essential for them, for their teaching
and for their students, adolescent or
adult, that they should keep their feet
on the ground and should go on with
their previous jobs in the economic,
social or political life of their respect¬
ive countries.
At the same time, college and univer¬
sity teachers, professors, lecturers,
etc., should participate in the country's
economic and social activities. The
aim should be to reach a situation
where a mathematician or sociologist,
a doctor, a journalist, an artist, an
e'ectronics expert, a local or national
government official, an industrialist
or a civil servant spends a certain
number of hours each week teaching
in higher education while carrying on
his or her regular job.
The sort of arrangement that certain
futurologists foresee for tomorrow,
such as "higher education programmes
that make use of 'mentors' drawn from
the adult population... Accountants,
doctors, engineers, businessmen, car¬
penters, builders and planners might
all become part of an 'outside
faculty' " (1), should become a reality
today.
"People with a creative talent in
literature and the arts will be added
to the list of teachers in spite of the
fact that they have no degrees.

future tense?
"Non-academics, under certain con¬
ditions at least, have perhaps the same

with practical experience in working
life into teaching.
I think it is up to higher education
to show the way and to set an example
if, instead of tagging along behind the
other forms of education, it wishes to
influence them, not only by the content
of the education which it provides but
also by Its methods and, in the
particular case we are discussing here,
by the composition of its teaching staff.
Only a few years ago, this question
might have seemed incongruous...
During a round table held at Unesco
headquarters on the problems of the
rôle and function of the university in
modern society, the sti.dent participants
agreed to discuss the questions raised
Drawings by Trez Í"'1 Unesco Courier
A.. .MAZING WORLD, ISN'T IT ?
The programme would include not only
regular academic courses in literature,
psychology, and chemistry but clinical
experience and field work of various
kinds" (5). But why use the con¬
ditional in all these cases?
The answer is, alas, only too simple:
the trouble lies in the physical resist¬
ance by institutions of higher education
to such innovations "Scholars and
scientists have not in the past
shown . . . broad-mindedness. When¬
ever they have had power they have
used it to eliminate most non-
academicians from undergraduate
teaching" (5).
This is the key to this problem,
which is political and not technical.
Its solution cannot depend solely on
the goodwill or lack of goodwill of the
teaching profession, and it is up to
society, to the government and the
authorities in general to bring people
by the admission of students to univer¬
sity on condition that the agenda
should also include a discussion on the
admission of teachers to university.
This is not surprising, considering
that in Britain, for instance, "the core
of the problem of improving university
teaching... is that a vast majority of
academic staff receive no training in
how to teach, so that... most teachers
have to learn for themselves the art
of instruction" (6), or that "even more
curious has been the attitude of some
professors to what they call 'pedagogy'
and for which they do not trouble to
hide their scorn" (7).
The question, however, is far from
being one of "pedagogy" alone: "What
once was an art the art of teaching
is now a science, built on firm foun¬
dations, and linked to psychology,
anthropology, cybernetics, linguistics
and many other disciplines. However,

the application of pedagogy by teachers
is in many cases more of an art than
a science" (8).
As regards the training of teachers
for higher education, it should be
realized that education at this level is
comparable in certain respects meth¬
odologically and technologically both
with adult education and with the type
of education at present given at
primary and secondary levels.
It thus becomes essential to develop
these methods at the higher level and
these methods are something which
can be learned. Few people are born
with a gift for teaching. Most of those
who are capable of putting over not
only their knowledge but also their
aptitudes and even their attitudes, are
. people who have learnt the technique.
After apprenticeships of varying
lengths, they have acquired the know¬
ledge necessary to teach at a particular
level. There is no reason to think
that teachers in higher education do
not need this special training to
enable them to put across their know¬
ledge much more effectively and
successfully than they do at present.
In the coming years all countries,
large or small, developed or devel¬
oping, will obviously require an in¬
creasing number of teachers for higher
education, and In world terms this
number will be very large indeed.
I think that, in order to meet this
demand, we should see to It that prop¬
erly organized training is given to all
those who will be full-time teachers in
higher education.
In this connexion, an interesting lead
has been given by the Government of
Mali, which has set up a higher edu¬
cation teacher training centre. At the
Centre, prospective teachers for higher
education are trained in their special
subjects and at the same time receive
teacher training so that they will be
able not merely to instruct the
country's future specialized personnel,
but to educate them In the fullest
sense of the word.
Anyone may be required, at some
time in his or her life, to teach others.
All students should therefore be
regarded as potential teachers. This
entails a far-reaching adjustment In
education from the first stages of
higher education onwards, but it does
not involve students alone: "...many
engineers, most librarians, most agri¬
cultural and other fieldmen, most
social workers, and many business
executives also need some preparation
as agents who will assist edu¬
cation" (7).
Seen from the viewpoint of lifelong
education, a viewpoint adopted by
most education systems, "should we *
not deduce from all this that an aptitude r

to educate should henceforward form
part of the training of every Individ¬
ual...? More specifically, it would
seem clear that educational theory and
practice have now become an integral
part of the training of any Individual
belonging to a modern society whose
occupation endows him with influence,
authority or responsibility towards
others" (1).
Two conclusions seem to me to
follow from what has been said.
Firstly, if higher education is to give
some training to all students to enable
them to become the teachers of
tomorrow, will they ,be properly
equipped to teach if their own teachers
today have not themselves been
trained? The answer to this question
Is certainly a negative one.
It follows that it is essential to give
pedagogical training to all who are
going to teach in higher education
today and tomorrow, so that they can
themselves produce educators in their
turn. This applies equally to full-time
teachers and to those who, as I
suggested earlier, might be called in to
teach part-time. Here again the re¬
sponsibility lies with higher education:
it has not only to teach the teachers
but also to teach the teachers' teachers.
I believe a first practical step in this
direction should be to change teacher
training institutions into institutions
giving pre-service and in-service
training to all who teach or may be
required to teach full-time or part-time
at any level, including that of higher
education.
These institutions could be used as
a testing ground for an interdisciplinary
form of instruction with education itself
as the main subject on the curriculum.
It would in fact be extremely interesting
to bring together in one place people
with experience in business, industry,
etc., students preparing for various
occupations and professions and uni¬
versity faculty members who have not
studied to be educators, and give them
all a training fully adapted to the tasks
that lie ahead.

The earliest musical instruments
were made from the bones of mammoths

In this collection of bones are
instruments from one of the world's
oldest orchestras, dating back some
20,000 years. Made from the bones
of mammoths, these percussion
instruments were unearthed at a
Palaeolithic site near the village of
Mezin, Ukraine. The largest include
a shoulder-blade (left), a leg-bone
(below), and a hip-bone (right).
ARCHAEOLOGICAL excavations
carried out at the site of a
Palaeolithic settlement (some 20,000
years old) in the village of Mezin,
near Chernigov in the Ukraine, bet¬
ween 1954 and 1962, brought to light
the remains of a house built of the
bones of a mammoth.
Inside the house, Ukrainian archae-
logists I.G. Pidoplichko and I.G. Shov-
koplyas found some large mammoth
bones decorated with a cut-out geo¬
metrical design and coloured red.
They were in a place apart and ap¬
peared to form a set, although their
purpose was not immediately clear.
The finds included a shoulder blade,
a thigh bone, two jaw bones, a frag¬
ment of pelvis and a portion of a mam¬
moth's skull. Two ivory rattles, a
mallet fashioned from a reindeer's
antler and a large number of sea shells
were also discovered on the floor of
the house, together with a "rattling"
bracelet with a simple but highly artis¬
tic design and consisting of five pieces
of mammoth-tusk ivory with carved
open-work decoration.
Near to the bones were found four
heaps of pure yellow and red mineral
ochre and also eight bone perforators.
The floor of the dwelling bore the
traces of three fireplaces and four
pairs of bone struts for supporting the
wigwam-type poles which had formerly
held up the roof.
Detailed analysis of the finds has
revealed that the history of this Pal¬
aeolithic construction falls neatly into
two periods. At first it was used as a
winter dwelling, but in the course of
time it became unsafe the whole
three-ton edifice was in danger of
collapse and was abandoned by its
inhabitants.
As the settlement grew, the villagers
needed a public building, so they took
over the old house, re-furbishing it,
shoring it up from the inside, cleaning
out the rubbish and using it as a
building for festive occasions and rites.
It was then that the decorated mam¬
moth bones and other objects of a
non-utilitarian nature were brought into
the building. It should be pointed out
that some of the minority peoples in the
north of Russia were still using aban¬
doned houses for similar ceremonial
purposes until fairly recent times.
Examination of the mammoth bones
eventually made it possible, in 1974, ^

Cro-Magnon
castanets
Formed of flattened rings of
mammoth-tusk ivory with
carved decoration, this
"castanet bracelet" discovered
at Mezin, in the Ukraine, is
the first Palaeolithic
instrument of its kind ever
found. The rings make a
harmonious sound when
rattled together, and it is
thought that the bracelet
may have been used to
accompany dances, thus
suggesting that dancing was
already practised in
Cro-Magnon times some
20,000 years ago.
to establish that they all formed part
* of a set of percussion instruments.
The reindeer-horn mallet and the rattle
fulfilled similar functions, while the
bracelet undoubtedly has some con¬
nexion with dancing, corresponding
roughly in function to a pair of casta¬
nets. The red dye and the bone per¬
forators were part of the "props".
The purpose of the objects found at
Mezin was established by a team of
archaeologists, palaeontologists, foren¬
sic scientists and medical experts.
The way in which the surface of the
bones is worn in places, the way the
outer part of the bone tissue is com¬
pacted and has flaked away from the
inner, spongy part, the way in which
the deformation of parts of the bone
is strictly localized, and in which cer¬
tain points on the surface have been
polished, as well as a number of other
clues, left the investigators in no doubt
that these were in fact percussion ins¬
truments.
The discovery of such instruments
dating from nearly 20,000 years ago is
of the greatest significance, and is the
first such discovery to have been
made. Previously, only bone flutes,
which incidentally have still not been
scientifically investigated, had been
discovered from Palaeolithic times in
the U.S.S.R., and in Central and
Western Europe.
The "castanet" bracelet is the first
such instrument ever to have been
found, and the only Palaeolithic object
to have been discovered in the
U.S.S.R. which confirms that the art
of dancing was known in Central and
Eastern Europe in Cro-Magnon times.
Although music is generally recog¬
nized to be one of the supreme mani¬
festations of culture, its early history
has not yet been very thoroughly
explored, as Professors Maurice
Freedman and Bruno Nettl made clear
in a "Unesco Courier" article ("Music
of the Centuries", June 1973). Music
has generally been regarded as dating
back to the civilizations of the ancient
Orient and to Antiquity.
As a result of the discovery of these
Palaeolithic instruments, this dating
has now been pushed back by at least
15,000 years, and rhythmic music is
seen to have been already in existence
in Cro-Magnon times. It thus appears
that Cro-Magnon man had already
mastered the elements of musical
rhythm, tone and phrasing and was
aware of the emotional impact of mu¬
sic. Music is thus probably as old as
working skills and crafts and as old
as society itself.
Dancing, which can also express the
whole complexity of human experience
from imitations of the gestures of
workers and craftsmen to the expres¬
sion of the most subtle emotions has
also existed for as long as music.
One of the earliest forms of the com¬
bined musical and choreographic per¬
formance whether of ritual signifi¬
cance or simply dancing for pleasure
was done to the accompaniment of
percussion instruments and also possi¬
bly to a sung accompaniment.
The structure of. music and dancing
is frequently compared with that of
language. This emphasizes the corre
lation between words and sounds,
between speech and music as a vehi¬
cle for the expression of thought and
ideas.
With the help of ethnography and
other specialized fields of study, using
the methods of cultural history and
comparative analysis and even experi¬
mental methods, it should be possible
to find out the basic facts about the
musical culture of Palaeolithic times.
This will give us a deeper insight into
the mentality of homo sapiens, how he
perceived the world, his emotional
make-up, his behaviour and other
aspects of his mental activity.
In order to get a rough Idea of the
sounds produced by the bone instru¬
ments, rather than relying only on the
ethnographic evidence, an experiment
was carried out at the Institute of
Forensic Science, in Kiev (Ukraine).
A musician carefully tapped out a
rhythm on different parts of the
shoulder-blade instrument. Sounds of
various timbres hard, resonant and
musically expressive were obtained.
This experiment was a first step in
the direction of investigating the range
of sounds of Palaeolithic untuned per¬
cussion instruments.

Prehistoric pan-pipes
While most of the musical instruments unearthed at the Palaeolithic site at Mezin
(Ukraine) were percussion instruments, flutes like this one (top) have been
discovered in Moldavia (U.S.S.R.), France, U.K., Czechoslovakia, and elsewhere.
Fashioned from a stag's antler, this flute found in Moldavia may be between 12 and
1 5,000 years old. The antler was hollowed out and six holes (four on one side, two
on the other) pierced to modulate the sound. Later, in Neolithic times (some
5,000 years ago) greater numbers of more sophisticated musical instruments were
made, like these bone Pan-pipes (above) reconstructed from fragments. In form
and conception they are remarkably similar to Pan-pipes still used in various parts
of the world today (Latin America, Rumania, Greece, etc.).

Bartolomé de Las Casas
FREEDOM AND THE RIGHT TO HUMAN DIGNITY
(Continued from page 13 )
of tyranny he did so in terms applica¬
ble to any place and time and which
are valid even today.
No government, he maintained, could
be imposed on a group of human
beings against their free will. Nor
could a people be forced to accept a
religion against their will. Here Las
Casas stands out as a champion of
"tolerance" and "freedom of con¬
science" with respect to minority peo¬
ples. He supported the right of Jewish
and Moslem minorities to full co-exis¬
tence alongside other religious com¬
munities. He felt that no community
should be obliged to accept Christian
preaching against its will.
"If the entire republic, by the com¬
mon accord of all of its members", he
wrote, does not wish to hear us, if,
as is the case with the Indians, it
wishes to remain with its own rites on
its own lands where there have never
been any Christians, then we cannot
make war on them."
Las Casas repeatedly maintained
that neither the crime of idolatry (which
he did not consider applicable) nor
abominable or unnatural sins, nor the
practice of human sacrifice were law¬
ful grounds for punishing the Indians,
making war on them or for depriving
them of their lands and freedom.
By the same token, he rejected the
idea that the term "blasphemy" was
applicable to the normal practice of
non-Christian religious rites (here Las
Casas again included not only the
Indians but the Jews and other peo¬
ples).
For Las Casas this principle of free¬
dom finds its application particularly
on the government level. Although we
do not find the term "democracy" in
any of his writings, we do find others
which are equivalent such as "govern¬
ment by common consent", "govern¬
ment by free will", etc. And he assert¬
ed the principle that "power emanates
directly from the people".
Departing from the current of thought
which later evolved toward absolu¬
tism, Las Casas maintained that gov¬
ernment by monarchy was not derived
from the authority of the Pater Fami¬
lias. "Monarchies", he wrote, "are a
more modern phenomenon", meaning
by that that they were not created by
Nature and did not originate at the
beginning of human society. This was
tantamount to maintaining that mon¬
archies were not an obligatory form
of government but depended on the
agreement of men who, indeed, had
invented them. The government of
kings, he wrote, "is based on the
voluntary consent of the subjects and
therefore does not imply either natural
force or absolute necessity".
Therefore, for Las Casas, the full con¬
sent of the members of a community
did not alienate their freedom which
was entrusted into the hands of the
sovereign, but rather implied that the
sovereign's task was to defend and
perfect that freedom. Las Casas
specifically told the King of Castile
that when his rule was accepted by
the Indians, it had to be confirmed In
order to preserve that precious right:
"the Indians do not lose their freedom",
he wrote, "by accepting and having
Your Majesty as universal lord. Rather,
having made good any defects that
they may have had in their republics,
the lordship of Your Majesty shall
clean and purify them and thus shall
they enjoy better freedom." (Among
the Remedies).
But Las Casas went even further.
Even after they had been converted to
Christianity, he said, the Indians re¬
mained free and any government over
them would only be lawful when they
had freely recognized it as their own.
"Should it be that after becoming
Christians they do not wish to receive
and obey such a supreme lord", he
affirmed, "this is no reason for making
war on them so long as they remain
in the faith and show respect for
justice."
This thesis, which may rightly be cal¬
led democratic, is complemented by his
assertion of a right which, under the
absolute monarchies in Europe, is
rarely acknowledged by other authors
in the 16th and 17th centuries: the
"right of resistance". For there are
cases, says Las Casas, where royal
prerogatives and decrees, however
coercive, cannot be received, obeyed
nor carried out, if they are against the
faith, and also "if they run counter
to the service and well-being of the
kingdom and against the common
good."
The defence of the democratic prin¬
ciple required, at that time, a demon¬
stration of the political capacity of the
Indians so Las Casas completed and
reinforced his spirited defence of the
freedom of the Indians with evidence
of their political abilities.
The greater part of his Apologetic
History, many passages of his History
of the Indies, and other writings are
based on the merits and legality of the
systems of government which the
Indians had established when they
were free.
This leads on to the crowning prin¬
ciple of the Las Casas system: the
principle of humanity.
For Las Casas, "all nations of the
world are composed of men and each
and all men have but one definition
and that is that they are rational
beings". All possess the same phys¬
ical and mental faculties; "all have the
natural principles or seeds to under¬
stand and learn and know the sciences
and those things which they do not
know and this is so not only among
those of virtuous disposition, but even
in those marred by moral depravity...";
"all cherish goodness and take plea¬
sure in what is agreeable and joyous
and all reject and hate evil and are
disturbed by what is offensive and
does them harm."
Differences indeed exist, said Las
Casas, since men live in different
places and so are subject to variations
in the conditions influenced by the
"heavens" (understood in its cosmo¬
graphie not its theological sense). And
so it is evident that the result of such
diversification of causes produces dif¬
ferent effects on the human body and
these effects determine the differences
between one man and another.
Yet for Las Casas the homegeneity
of human nature far outweighs individ¬
ual difference and exerts a powerful
Influence on the oneness of mankind.
Thus the Ideas of particularism and
universalism are expressed by Las
Casas in a new way that comes closer
to the thinking of modern man.
The cosmopolitanism he professed
goes far beyond a mere ethical atti¬
tude; it relates directly to everyday
human life and determines the relations
between all men and women on a
planet which, in the words of the great
Spanish humanist Luis Vives, had been
made explicit for the first time.
Las Casas thus depicts for us an
authentic "cosmopolitanism of co¬
existence", in which "all men are united
and linked together by a natural
brotherhood and kinship...", as he
writes in his prologue to History of
the Indies.
And so the human universalism of
Las Casas establishes the most exalted
of all political rights: the right to
human dignity.

Global science
information network
Unesco has begun projects that will
enable Bulgaria, Colombia, Guinea, India
and Sudan to establish or improve scientific
and technological documentation and infor¬
mation services. Costing nearly $2 million,
the projects are the first phase of Unesco's
UNISIST programme, which aims to dev¬
elop a world-wide network of scientific
and technical information services that will
systematically process, store and exchange
information, studies and reports for the
benefit of scientists and technologists in all
countries.
World population
up by 78 million
The world's population reached 3,860
million in mid-1973, an increase of 78 million
in one year, reports the latest U.N.
Demographic Yearbook. The figure rep¬
resents a 2.1 '% annual growth rate which,
If maintained, will double world population
(to over 7,700 million) by the year 2007.
The U.N. Yearbook presents international
statistics on area, population, birth, death,
marriage and divorce and life expectancy
($38 cloth-bound; $30 paperbound; order
from Sales Section, United Nations, New
York or Geneva, or from booksellers).
Unesco's literature
translations programme
Nearly 450 works have been translated
under Unesco's auspices since its literature
translations programme was launched in
1948. The works cover religion, philosophy,
poetry, history, classical and modem
novels, among other literary genres. They
belong to over 60 different literatures
(Asian, African, Latin American, European,
Arabic, Persian, as well as non-Slavic
literatures of the Soviet Union). Most have
been translated into English and French,
and others into German, Italian, Arabic,
Spanish and some Asian and African lan¬
guages. (See "Bookshelf this page.)
'To Reach the Village...'
In its series "Unesco in Action", Unesco's
Office of Public Information has recently
published a booklet entitled, "To Reach the
Village...", describing Unesco's promotion
of rural newspapers in Africa. The booklet,
in English, French and Spanish language
editions, traces the various stages leading
to the creation of rural newspapers in the
Congo, Mali, Niger, Tanzania and Togo and
of an African Association of Rural Journal¬
ists made up of editors from these countries
and from Senegal.
Women in science:
a man's world
"Women in science: a man's world" is
the theme of the latest issue of Unesco's
quarterly Impact of Science on Society
(Vol. XXV, No. 2, April-June 1975). Less
than a quarter of the world's scientists are
women, although as physicist Jacqueline
Feldman points out in her article "The
savant and the midwife", "the time when
the proposition that women could be
scientists needed to be proved is past."
Among other articles contributed by eight
women scientists and science writers are
"Woman's scientific creativity", "Obstacles
to women in science" and "How a woman
scientist deals professionally with men."
Unesco studies
on Slavic cultures
Beginning this year, Unesco is to publish
a series of booklets, in English and French,
on leading figures of Slavic cultures. They
will include works on Pushkin, the Ukrainian
poet Shevchenko, the famous Byelorussian
scholar Skorna, the Polish poet and patriot
Mickiewicz and the Bulgarian writer and
patriot Botev. Other activities planned
under Unesco's continuing project on the
study of Slavic cultures include the publi¬
cation (in French, in 1976) of an art album
on the Slavic peoples' use of wood in
architecture and sculpture, and the prepa¬
ration of art albums on the decorative arts,
monumental painting and easel painting.
Flashes...
Nationwide health service campaigns
have enabled Cuba to eradicate malaria and
poliomyelitis and to reduce the threat of
other diseases, reports WHO's monthly
magazine "World Health".
Two conferences on revising history and
geography textbooks are being held this
year under the joint auspices of the National
Commissions for Unesco in the German
Federal Republic and Poland.
In Bangladesh, WHO and UNICEF have
launched emergency campaigns to distribute
30 million vitamin capsules to protect the
country's 15 million preschool children from
blindness due to vitamin deficiency.
B Art thefts are increasing, and according
to one authority at least $100 billion worth
of stolen works of art are currently at large.
B Iran has become the 11th country to
adhere to the Unesco Convention for the
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural
Heritage.
Many Asian countries are falling serious¬
ly behind U.N. targets for development of
water resources, reports the U.N. Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific.
INTERNATIONAL
WOMEN'S YEAR

This stamp commemorating International
Women's Year 1975 was issued by the
United Nations Postal Administration, on
May 9, 1975. Depicting a silhouette of a
man and a woman, shown together as
equals, it underlines the United Nations
call for "a change in laws and traditions
that discriminate against women..." and
"action to redress the existing imbalances
in all fields..."

Letters to the Editor
VOTES FOR WOMEN
IN ISLE OF MAN
Sir,
Your March 1975 issue on Inter¬
national Women's Year is excellent and
I look forward to the August-September
1975 issue on the same subject with
the greatest interest.
In the March issue it is stated that
New Zealand was, in 1893, the first
nation in the world to grant women the
vote. In fact women obtained the vote
in the Isle of Man in 1881.
D.H. Rowledge
Derby, U.K.
Editor's note: Situated half way
between England and Ireland, the Isle of
Man has a 1 ,000-year-old parliament, the
Court of Tynwald, which is the oldest
parliament in the British Commonwealth.
PERILS OF POLLUTION
Sir,
Keeping the oceans clean from
pollution is a problem throughout the
world. Equally vital is the problem of
disease among the commercial varieties
of fish, much of it caused by such
pollution. I believe readers would be
interested to know about some of the
results obtained by scientists in this
field, such as the causes of certain
diseases, preventive measures, death
rate among fish population from malig¬
nant tumours, etc.

'ON TRANSLATION'
Sir,
I would like to congratulate you for
publishing the most interesting article,
"On Translation", by Octavio Paz in
your February 1975 issue. Equally
interesting was the accompanying illus¬
tration of the engraving detail from
"Metamorphosis II" by the Netherlands'
artist, Mauritz Cornelis Escher.

THE ODYSSEY
OF VLADIMIR RUSANOV
Sir,
November 1975 marks the birth
centenary of Vladimir Alexandrovich
Rusanov, Russian scientist, traveller and
a great explorer of the Arctic region.
. , For some years Rusanov lived in
France, where he studied natural
sciences at the University of Paris and
where he joined a French Arctic
expedition under Charles Bernard in
1908. Then he was approached by the
Russian government, and at its request
he led four subsequent expeditions into
the Arctic, each of which was a major
contribution to the exploration and
conquest of the Polar region.
In 1912, after a successful expedition
to Spitzbergen, during which geological
prospecting and hydrographie investi¬
gations were carried out, Rusanov made
up his mind to navigate from the
Atlantic to the Pacific via the Arctic
Ocean on board his sailing and motor
ship Hercules.
This expedition ended disastrously
with the deaths of all its eleven
members, including Rusanov's fiancée,
Juillet Jean, who had joined the venture
as the expedition's doctor.
Vladimir Rusanov, who sacrificed his
life for the sake of world science and
the exploration of the Arctic, is well
remembered and respected by scientists
and Polar explorers in many countries.
I believe his efforts and achievements
should be made more widely known on
the occasion of his centenary this year.

EDUCATION FOR PROGRESS
Sir,
A student in my final year at school,
I am a member of a Unesco club which
I also founded. My wish is to help to
educate the African villagers who are
still illiterate, to teach them to read and
write so that they can overcome the
scourge of ignorance which is holding
back the development of African
countries.
Instead of spending enormous sums
on weapons, it is time to provide these
peoples with help and teaching so that
they can improve sanitation and farming
techniques. "Dignity comes through
learning", my fellow-African, Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General of
Unesco, has said. Only through edu¬
cation can we get rid of numerous
obstacles which prevent the African
villagers from climbing the ladder of
progress.

AFRICAN VILLAGE NEWSROOM
Sir,
A sixth-former at Loum, in Cameroon,
I came across the "Unesco Courier" for
the first time at the home of the head¬
master of a school at N'Lohe, 12 km
away. I thoroughly enjoy reading your
magazine, published as It is by Unesco,
the world organization best qualified to
inform and educate the public.
In the rural area where I live we
have great difficulty in obtaining news.
The local newspapers provide, news
about our own country, but in the
modern world it is vital to find out about
world problems and we do not have this
possibility. So we have formed a group
of senior pupils, of which I am president,
in order to collect information and ideas
to pass on to our fellow pupils and the
people at large, since we- do not even
have a library.

VICISSITUDES
OF A LEONARDO MANUSCRIPT
Sir,
Your impressive issue on the re¬
discovered manuscripts of Leonardo da
Vinci (October 1974) gave readers a
good opportunity to get acquainted
with Leonardo's projects and ideas
which placed him far ahead of the
contemporary scientific world. I do not
think there is another written source on
Leonardo so well and clearly worded,
and so rich in facts about Leonardo's
versatile genius.
However, I would like to comment on
Paolo Galluzzi's article, "The Strange
Vicissitudes of Leonardo's Manuscripts".
In it he writes that Leonardo's Codex
on The Flight of Birds was sold by a
certain Count Manzoni to the eminent
Leonardo scholar, Theodore Sabach-
nikoff. In fact, Fyodor Vasilyevich
Sabachnikov bought this manuscript
from Manzoni's heirs at an auction after
the Count's death. Moreover, although
the article does say that Sabachnikoff
handed over the Codex to the Biblioteca
Reale in Turin, it fails to mention that
the Russian scholar made a gift of this
invaluable document to the Italian
people. With the help of eminent
scientists, Sabachnikov published a fac¬
simile edition of this Codex. It came
out in 300 copies in 1893. Printed on
the kind of parchment used in Leonardo's
time, specially produced for the
occasion, it still remains a unique work
of facsimile printing of ancient manu¬
scripts.

EXPLORING THE UNIVERSE
Sir,
I eagerly await the arrival of the
"Unesco Courier", because the subjects
treated in the magazine are always
dealt with in a thorough and stimulating
way.
Your magazine thus keeps me fully
informed on a wide range of topics of
paramount interest to the modern world.
I particularly enjoyed the issues devoted
to Copernicus (April, 1973) and Leo¬
nardo da Vinci (October, 1974).
Astronomy, one of the world's oldest
sciences, has reached a very high level
of technical achievement through the
extraordinarily precise and abundant
data about the universe which are
available to modern scientists. I hope
you will consider this exciting subject
as a possible theme when planning
future issues.
Marina Núñez Jordán

Editor's note: We are considering
this as a future subject.

ART OF Oceania
New Guinea-Melanesia, which spans the western Pacific from West Irian to .New
Caledonia, is one of the major cultural areas of Oceania. In New Guinea,
500 languages are spoken, a diversity that also characterizes its ways of life and
art. This mask of "tapa" (bark cloth) from the Papuan Gulf area of the island is
one of many used in initiation rituals held every 10 or 20 years. (See pages 14-23
for article and photo report on the art of Oceania.)
