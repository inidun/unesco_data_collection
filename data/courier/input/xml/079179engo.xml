With the publication of this issue devoted to
photography, the Unesco Courier marks its
fortieth anniversary. The conception and
presentation of the entire number are a departure
from the usual Courier formula in the sense that
priority is given to the pictures; these are
complemented by texts which attempt to provide
an insight into the mind of the photographer.
The issue has been prepared as an album of
photos chosen to illustrate the general theme of
photography as a means of memorializing people,
places and events. Our coverage of this vast
subject is inevitably far from exhaustive there is,
for example, no history ofphotography nor an
account of its many applications in science and
technology. The following pages have been
designed to highlight a certain approach to
photography in an age in which it has become a
ubiquitous and perhaps even sometimes an
overwhelming medium.
By keeping oblivion at bay and constituting
what Charles Baudelaire called the "archives of
our memory", by bearing witness to private and
public life, forming a documentary record of
current events on a national or global scale, or
simply capturing the fleeting moment when the
eye of the photographer meets the eye of the
subject, photography can be an instrument of the
utmost value in human communication and
understanding.
The professional and non-professional
photographers of yesterday and today whose
work is featured here, as well as many others
whose photos we have been unable to include, all
participate in a process which restores life to
moments from the past. In the case of four of these
photographers, we also evoke, by means of a
photo and a short biographical sketch, the work of
four earlier masters of the medium with whom
they have affinities.

PHOTOGRAPHY AND MEMORY
Aphotographer's viewpoint
AN INTERVIEW WITH WIM WENDERS
Wim Wenders: Hot Springs, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico
WIM
WENDERS
of the Federal Republic of Germany, is a
film-maker. In 1975 he set up his own com¬
pany, Road Movies. A number of his films
have won him an international reputation.
They include Alice in den Städten (1973;
Alice in the Cities), Im Lauf der Zeit (1976;
Kings of the Road), Der amerikanische
Freund (1977; The American Friend), Light¬
ning Over Water/Nick's Movie (1980), Par¬
is, Texas (1984) and DerHimmel über Berlin
(1987; Wings of Desire).
In preparation for the shooting of his film
Paris, Texas towards the end of 1983, Wim
Wenders travelled around the American
West armed with a medium-size hand
camera, a Makina-Plaubel 6 x 7. During this
journey through Texas, Arizona, New Mex¬
ico and California looking for locations, he
was struck by the seemingly infinite land¬
scapes bathed in light and colour that often
only retained a fleeting trace ofcivilization.
The series of colour pictures which he took
with this camera are both a tribute to the
semi-mythical emotive power of the land¬
scape and a reflection on memory. A selec¬
tion of these photographs was published in
1987 under the title Written in the West,
with an accompanying interview between
Wim Wenders and the French criticandfilm
directorAlain Bergala, extracts from which
we publish here.
Would you say that photography, more
than film, allows you to capture an image
of something that you are seeing for the
first time?
Yes. With photography, you can visit a
place only once. When you return to a place,
you seldom feel any desire to take photo¬
graphs. For me, the known or the familiar
virtually rules out photography, which is a
means of exploration, a journey. It's a bit
like a car or plane, which takes you some¬
where. A camera takes you somewhere.
Above all, it makes it possible to stop and
take things in properly.
Especially in the West, travelling by car,
the camera gave me a reason and an obliga¬
tion to stop. I don't take photographs out of
the window.
How did it happen, exactly stopping, de¬
ciding to take a photograph and choosing
the frame for the subject?
You arrive in a place, a village, for exam¬
ple, you stop, and you feel a sort of ex¬
citement, even before you have come across

PHOTOGRAPHY AND MEMORY
Wim Wenders: Portrait, Odessa, Texas
what you are going to photograph. You have
a feeling for the place: there is something in
the light, a special atmosphere. My photo¬
graphs are often linked to a certain surface
texture of landscape and houses. That par¬
ticular surface is something that you feel
before you have really found the place to
photograph. For example, I arrived in a little
town in New Mexico which is also called Las
Vegas, and there I took a photograph of an
empty shop, painted blue and red. I had a
presentiment, when I started strolling
around, that I would find this house. Arriv¬
ing in that deserted town, with that after¬
noon light and nobody in the streets, I knew
that I would stay there and that I would have
to find a hotel, because I would not be able to
leave again. The place could not be in the film
because it was too remote, but I went there
because I was interested in seeing another
Las Vegas.
In the West, there are a lot of billboards
and cinema façades that have already been
half eaten away by the elements and are in
the process of disappearing. There is a con¬
nection between photography and this dam
aged surface. In the cinema, too, I have often
chosen a site for shooting because I knew
that a particular house was going to be de¬
molished. For example, in The American
Friend, we filmed in front of a row of houses
because we had read in a newspaper that the
whole neighbourhood was going to be de¬
molished. In large cities like Houston, the
opposite is true: the surface was so new that
it all looked like a model.
So making an image means looking at
things before they disappear ...
In these photos there is the desire to look
at something and the desire to keep it. The
word is appropriate in French: re-garder.
The photographs taken by Walker Evans
during the Depression convey this exactly:
looking at and committing to memory some¬
thing that was going to disappear in three or
four years' time.
This is just the feeling that we have when
we look at photographs by Atget1 of
certain street corners and little shops in
Paris ...
I think this was his whole ethic: that he
saw himself as a "preserver". I always
appreciate this preservation side of photo¬
graphy.
It gives all these photographs an air of the
end of the world, especially the little towns,
street corners and shops ... As if you had
taken these photographs just after the
world had come to an end. We do not get
the same feeling from Paris, Texas, which
conveys a sense of beginning, among other
things. In this voyage of discovery, was
there a melancholy feeling connected with
the photography?
Melancholy is also connected with the
American West, and we can talk about that.
But in photography, more than in film, there
is an idea of the end of the world. I remember
what Nicholas Ray2 said to me one day
about some actors whom he was teaching.
1. Eugène Atget (1857-1927) photographed the
architecture of old Paris.
2. Nicholas Ray (pseudonym of Raymond Nicholas
Kienzle, 1911-1979), American film director, whose
works include Johnny Guitar (1954) and, with V/im
V/enders, Lightning Over Water/Nick's Movie (1980).

PHOTOGRAPHY AND MEMORY
WALKER
EVANS
(1903-1975)
Shoeshine Sign in a Southern Town, 1936. This
American photographer, with whom Wim Wen¬
ders has affinities, produced a powerful body of
work. His precisely detailed, frontal depictions of
reality have profoundly influenced contemporary
photography. He is known best for the reports
carried out in the 1930s for the Farm Security
Administration in the United States, in which he
recorded the poverty of rural victims of the De¬
pression. He was also a portraitist who recorded
scenes in the subway (1938) and on the Chicago
streets in the 1940s. In the 1950s, he produced a
series of industrial landscapes seen from trains.
He told them: "Even if you are asking for a
light for your cigarette, or if you simply say
hello, it is absolutely necessary that you do it
as if it were for the last time." I was impress¬
ed by this idea of doing something as if it
were for the last time, and for me this is
connected with photography. That is the
"end of the world" side of things. In fact, I
took this photograph because I knew that it
was the first and last time that I would see
this house. But, conversely, the very fact that
there is a photograph proves that the world
is continuing.
The idea of the deterioration of houses and
billboards, the "end of the world" aspect, is
connected with human beings and their
constructions. But what happens to trees,
landscapes and the natural world in your
photographs, in the light of your fondness
for capturing things that are crumbling
away?
There are very few photographs in which
there is no man-made object. In most of
them, there is always something which,
some day, will not be there any more, and
which is perhaps no longer there at this very
moment when we are talking about it. Or in
ten years or a hundred years from now.
The American West, to me, is the epitome
of the place where something disappears.
When I was a child, I knew the West through
films, westerns and novels, especially the
books of Karl May,3 and it was always my
impression that the West was this incredible
landscape in the process of being "won", in a
past that I located rather vaguely in the
nineteenth century. When I went there, hav¬
ing heard all about that conquest, I thought
that there would now be civilization. But not
at all. Civilization merely passed through,
especially with the advent of the motor car in
the 1920s and 1930s when the freeways, gas
stations and motels were built. But now,
when you get there, that whole culture of
roads, gasoline pumps, cars, neon signs and
motels is no longer necessary. To a great
extent it is not even used any more. People
no longer travel by car from New York to
3. Karl May (1842-1912), German author of travel and
adventure stories often set in the American West, includ¬
ing Winnetou (1893; Eng. trans. 1977).
Los Angeles. Americans tend to live more on
the coast, or in the Mid-West for farming,
but in the West they have passed through
and tried to do something, they have built
roads and so on, and they have even thought
of building towns sometimes, in the
middle of the desert you find a street called
375th Street but nothing has worked out,
and now only trucks pass through, and a few
cars. Civilization arrived, stayed a little
while, and is now once again disappearing.
Does your fondness for inscriptions, let¬
tering and billboards stem from the fact
that you very much liked the photographs
of Walker Evans?
The presence of written inscriptions in the
landscape is also a phenomenon characteris¬
tic of the West: Since people were not really
able to live there, it is my impression that
they started to write things so as to feel less
alone and to prove that they had conquered
this landscape. It's almost as if you had
arrived at the North Pole and found twenty
or so notices set up by those who had already
been there, to prove that they had reached it.

PHOTOGRAPHY AND MEMORY
Wim Wenders: Western World, near Four Corners, California
In the United States, this graphic tradition is
really remarkable and very advanced. It
shows a great deal of imagination and inven¬
tiveness and attention to detail in filling in
shadows and outlines of letters. The work on
the lettering of neon signs and advertise¬
ments is quite amazing, and in many cases it
is very attractive.
Americans always say: "A man must build
a house." And it's true, they build like mad:
what they build does not last very long, but
there are houses. But very often you also get
the impression that a man must first of all
paint a sign, and very often the sign is the
most valid part of the house. The house itself
is tumbledown, but the sign is a fine one. I
find these lasting inscriptions very poignant.
For example, I passed through an empty
place where there was nothing except a sign
saying: Western World Development. They
must have wanted to sell the land, but no¬
body came to buy it ...
These photographs seem to imply that you
favour a frontal, flat approach. Is this a
means whereby you turn the things
photographed into something sacred, set
apart from the flow of passing time and
trivial events?
That's true. Things do not know much
about time; I am the one who knows about
time, because, for one thing, I arrive and
depart again. So the head-on way of looking
at things, houses and landscapes is also the
approach from which I myself am the most
absent, and at the same time the most at one
with what is in front of me. In the West, the
horizon becomes a powerful presence, im¬
posing itself all the time, much more than in
the towns. Whatever you do, the horizon is
always there, cutting the photograph in two,
and all the objects are placed in relation to
the horizon, because the perspective draws
all lines towards the horizon. If the axis is not
frontal, if you adopt another angle, then the
object becomes detached from its horizon.
This is visually irritating, and it also deprives
the objects of something. Moreover, in the
American West, everything man-made is
highly theatrical. Once you are in an open
landscape, direct vision is, in a way, the only
possible approach, because any other mode
of looking, at an angle from the side, from
above or from below entails separating an
object from its surroundings. With frontal
vision, things keep their identity, but from
an angle they lose it, and the angle points to
the photographer.
These extracts from Alain Bergala's interview with
Wim Wenders have been taken from Written in
the West, with the kind permission of Schirmer
Mosel publishers, Munich. The interview first
appeared in the French magazine Cahiers du Cine¬
ma (Paris, 1987 ).

The compassionate eye BY YVES BONNEFOY
FACE TO FACE
Martine Franck: The American photographer Paul Strand (1890-1976)
in his garden at Orgeval, near Paris, 1974
MARTINE
FRANCK
a Belgian photographer, is a member of the
Vu picture agency set üp by the French
photographer Pierre de Fenoyl in 1970-
1971 , and one of the founder members of the
Viva agency in Paris. She has also been a
member of the Magnum Photo Agency since
1980. Her work has featured in both group
exhibitions and one-woman shows and
selections have been published as Le temps
de vieillir (1980) and Le théâtre du soleil
(1982). To mark her most recent exhibition
(13 April to 29 May 1988 at the Maison de la
Culture, Amiens, France), a portfolio of 18
photographs has been published with an
accompanying text by Yves Bonnefoy.
When I reflect on Martine Franck's work,
there comes to mind her portrait of an old
man in a home for the aged, seated on the
edge of a bed, the wall behind him plastered
with erotic photographs. Every oppor¬
tunity was there for Martine Franck to in¬
dulge in that kind of cruelty that is some¬
times passed off as a desire to seek truth.
Instinctively, however, in those for ever
frozen features, those eyes lost in a blank
reverie, she saw and showed us that there yet
remained a trace of that force that spurred
mankind to build the world, to establish
values, to bring together and give form to
scattered but lasting elements, things in
abeyance, in short, to create the absolute.
In this particular instance, as in many
others, Martine Franck had the insight to
rediscover in a human being with no obvious
qualities something of the dignity that is
apparent to the highest degree in the ravaged
face of Nerval or in Baudelaire's troubled
look. Such is the magic that photography can
work through the agency of a compassionate
being; and through this alchemy, the infinite
background of dreams, the idea that one has
of oneself, disappears, but something of the
absolute appears.
This is the message of the best of those
pilgrims who roam the world, Leica in hand.
"See," they say, "even in that moment when
you are illusion, irrelevance, futility, even in
the instant when you are nothing, when you
are nothingness itself, you are, and, in being,
you are everything, you are the all."
Compassion is above all a capacity for
self-effacement, for forgetting self in the en¬
counter with others. Of all the contempor¬
ary forms of expression, photography alone
demands compassion and humility as a sine
qua non. It demands the kind of humility
possessed by the great medieval craftsmen
who, in the period that followed the archaic
stylizations of their predecessors and before
the advent of humanistic refinements, knew
so surely how to carve out of a block of
wood faces of the madonna, in majesty or in
sorrow yet with the features of the most
ordinary of women, that were imbued with
the reality of the churchyard tree or the
flowers in blue clay vases placed before the
statues. In its innermost strivings, very mod-

FACE TO FACE
Martine Franck: Examining a painting by Paul Delvaux
at an exhibition of Belgian art held in Paris, 1974
em art is at one with the best of this religious
period.
In my mind's eye I see again Martine
Franck one summer's afternoon in the de¬
serted outskirts of a small town in Provence,
in the south of France. In the intense heat she
emerges abruptly, camera in hand, out of the
bright curtain of light. What is she doing?
Does she really expect, in this setting so
familiar to her, to chance upon the unex¬
pected or some scene of furtive stealth? Is
she, I wonder, not there rather just to learn
the art of being nothing, of dissolving herself
into the nothingness between earth and sky,
training herself thus to comply with the
demands of her art, of which clearly she has
the highest and most noble vision?
When we look at certain photographs, we
often ask ourselves: "How did the photo¬
grapher manage to get so close undetected?
With what silent tread did he stalk the fabu¬
lous bird as it alighted for just an instant?"
Others may wonder: "Does this not make
the photographer feel divorced from life, out
of the world? What loneliness, what sadness,
this constant watchfulness must bring."
The fact is that these soundless steps must
first be made within oneself, for it is there, in
that inner space, that those intuitive events,
those extra-sensory perceptions occur that
are the summum of an art that is prima facie
devoted to the externality of things. It is in
the intercourse of self with self that no sound
must be made that might frighten away a
vision or glimpse of a vision. When we suc¬
ceed in doing this, as we stand with bated
breath, far from being outside the world the
uplifted soul hears the beating of the deep
heart's pulse, the joyful shouts of children at
play beneath a line of washing, the wind
turning sheets into sails, and the chirruping
of cicadas.
Martine Franck walked in silence that
summer's day, already in this frame of mind.
Had she photographed a peasant woman in a
black straw hat, or a child with hand at
forehead, warding off the menace of a
threatening world, she would simply, direct¬
ly, as light goes to light, have picked out
from the woman's shadowy figure, from the
child's rebellious forelock, that look which
embodies the One behind the multiple.
Of all Martine Franck's photographs, I
like particularly that of Paul Strand. That
deep metaphysical solidarity which links her
with all her subjects is here made more com¬
plex by the fact that the model is himself a
photographer, taken unawares at his work,
absorbed in his own silent tread. This gives a
touch of humour to the ordinary photo¬
graphic experience, adding to it another de¬
gree of reflection which is superbly captured
in the very image from which it sprang.
Paul Strand is in a garden in which the play
of light on foliage conjures up memories of
Claude Monet, his garden at Giverny, Im¬
pressionist painting, and an entirely different
relationship between art and light. He is
holding an ancient, barely portable camera
which he is aiming at we know not what
target, since it is out of the field of vision of
Martine Franck's photograph. One has the
feeling that, more than anything else, he is
wondering where the devil he can put this
cumbrous black box down for a moment.
How long has he been so carefully, even
anxiously carrying it around? For forty
years maybe judging by his lined forehead;

long enough at any rate to be aware of the
dangers of what he is doing and to be con¬
scious of his responsibilities. Burdened with
this camera, which evokes the origins of
photography, this great photographer seems
to be asking : "Have I any right to be here?
Am I not planting a time bomb which may
destroy the world, despite the element of the
eternal in the light among the foliage?"
And it is true that photography is danger¬
ous. Some photographers exercise their art
with care; it is the others, purveyors of news
or fancies, with their reckless hastiness com¬
pounded of a truly sacrilegious indifference,
who incite us to look only at the outermost
exterior, the least significant superficialities.
If nineteenth-century photography de¬
nounced illusion (bringing the subject into
disrepute even in the eyes of painters, and
edging them out-of-doors, at Giverny as
elsewhere), in the twentieth century it has
gone to excess in the rejection of values and
the flouting of good sense; it is, it would
seem, concerned with nothing but the sub¬
stance and the celebration of death.
Yet, even now, photography is still one of
those rare fields in which can flower in the
persons of a few such as these two, commun¬
ing in this garden something, perhaps a
great deal, of that enlightenment of the
whole being of which the great traditions,
and in particular Buddhism, tell us. Martine
Franck was right to spice with a generous
sprinkling of light humour (a mark of con¬
fidence) her meeting amid the trees and flow¬
ers with her elder colleague, who views,
perhaps, with some dismay, the seemingly
countless horde of unseeing photographers
invading the whole world, putting it to sack.
Nothing is ever really lost of an art or a
skill, when the best that there is in us can still
find expression in it, if only fleetingly . Has it
not, and have we not too, at least the right to
dream? Great revolutions of the spirit are
indeed born of a countenance at peace, of a
simple smile. So why should we not continue
to carry with us along every highway and
byway of life that strange box, daily growing
smaller and smaller yet more than ever man¬
ifestly destined for decisive action, focusing
it on that which we love (for ever waiting
there, close but invisible). Is the West, in¬
deed the world, destined to perish in a flood
of photographs? Who can tell? Perhaps
salvation will be found at the edge of doom
in the simple, epiphanic message that a few
among them have to offer.

this British photographer went back to England
and concentrated mainly on photojournalism. He
put together a series of images of life among the
different social strata at the time, ranging from
working people in industrial towns to the middle
and upper classes in their homes and clubs. During
the air raids on London in the early 1940s he
worked for the Home Office, making a photo¬
graphic record of city-dwellers in their improvised
shelters. From 1945-1965 he photographed wri¬
ters and artists in their working environment for
Lilliput magazine. These powerful and shrewd
portraits are greatly admired by Martine Franck.
He was also an innovator in studies of the female
nude, using distorted perspectives and unconven¬

Unvarnishedportraits BY ALFREDO CRUZ RAMIREZ
Romualdo García
ROMUALDO
GARCIA
Romualdo García was born in 1852 in Silao,
near Guanajuato, Mexico, where he was later
to set up as a photographer. Guanajuato was
a flourishing mining town in his day, with a
School of Applied Arts that was open to new
techniques such as that of photography.
Thanks to Romualdo Garcia's photo¬
graphic studio, the art of portraiture was
democratized. Ordinary people from all
walks of life labourers, clerks, farmers
came along in their best clothes on high days
and holidays, when there was something to
celebrate, or simply after church on Sun¬
days. The sitting at the photographer's
would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for
most of them, a "bit of a treat? not the result
of having to "keep up with the Joneses" as
was the case in Europe. People had their
pictures taken just as they were, in their
awkwardness, happiness, pride or sen¬
timentality. Group portraits at entertain¬
ments, family album pictures extolling the
bonds of kinship, couples flaunting their
love or their complicity, pictures to remem¬
ber grandparents by, or souvenirs of the
"little angels", those children who died while
still babies. The photographs are reminiscent

of the folk-art tradition, with their poses
often borrowed from religious imagery.
Romualdo García was awarded a bronze
medal for his portraits at the Paris Interna¬
tional Exhibition of 1889, and his work also
attracted attention at the 1900 Exhibition.
The Garcia studio was doing very well at that
time, but after the Mexican Revolution of
1910, it came up against financial difficulties
and was taken over by the founder's children
when he died in 1930. His work was redisco¬
vered as recently as 1978, when research was
first carried out on this rich collection of
images, an incomparable visual testimony to
his country's heritage.
The work of the Garcia studio is both a
unique record of daily life strongly rooted in
the 19th century, and a demonstration of
people's genuineness in front of the camera,
the frankness of a golden age that had
confidence in the magical new technology,
notwithstanding certain misgivings as to its
efficacity. D
The photographs reproduced here appeared in the
exhibition "Romualdo García, an early Mexican
portrait photographer", organized by the art
historian and museologist Alfredo Cruz Ramirez,
with the assistance of the "Paris-Audiovisuel"
Association, the Museum of Alhóndiga de Grana-
ditas in Guanajuato (Mexico) and Flor Garduño, a

FACE TO FACE
A time-spun art BY EDOUARD GLISSANT
MORHOR
a writer, artist and photographer of French
origin, divides his time between the Antilles,
France and Greece. In 1987, he held an ex¬
hibition at the Museum of Modern Art in
Mexico City entitled Testigo mudo ("Mute
Witness"), which consisted of portraits of
artists and intellectuals, for the most part
Mexican. Two albums of his work will be
published next year, one of large-format
portraits and the other a collective work on
the theme of "The new Gulliver's travels",
on which Morhor has collaborated with a
number of painters.
Just as the waters of a river change as they
flow to the sea, so Morhor's art ripens and
matures, in dogged quest of its own defini¬
tion. It is an art which might be likened to a
journey of initiation, throughout which the
voyager seeks to attain the node, the focal
point wherein all human care is subsumed.
At first Morhor used to place those he
photographed against a stark background, a
recessed doorway or an abandoned room, as
though to warn them against those distrac¬
tions of existence that tend to distance us
from our own verities. Gradually he came
closer to those whoone cannot call them
models are best described as his interlocu¬
tors, his conversation companions, even,
perhaps, his confidants. It took him a long
time to abbreviate this short, yet infinite,
distance. It is as though, from then on, on the
evidence of the face alone, divorced from its
setting, he focused on that invisible break-
line that announces the time, the need to
depart, to grow old, and yet to endure.
The portrait thus evoked is not a death
mask; rather it is the shade of a doppel-
ganger. Not one of those whom Morhor
thus encountered is reduced simply to an
effigy that marked his route, an unyielding
milestone. There is a response at the other
end of this voyage. Morhor incites com¬
munication, the complicity of continuity.
He hears the echo and questions and con¬
sults it. We can but admire and understand
him as he constructs this precious, fragile
"brushwood rampart", so redolent of the
future. D

THE ALBERT KAHN
COLLECTIONS
Autochromes from the Albert Kahn Collections
have been reproduced in colour in several books,
including Les Archives de la Planète, in two
volumes ("France", and "The World"), with an
introductory text by Jeanne Beausoleil, curator of
the Albert Kahn Collections, and Mariel J.
Brunhes Delamarre (Hachette Réalités, Paris,
1979), and Villages et villageois au Tonkin 191 i et
1920 (Albert Kahn Collections, 1987). A collec¬
tion of autochromes taken in Ireland in 1913 will
be published shortly. A comprehensive catalogue
was compiled for the exhibition "Au-delà d'un
jardin ... Albert Kahn", which was held at the
Cultural Centre, Boulogne-Billancourt, in 1986.
"Life. We must seize it wherever it is,
abroad, in the street, everywhere." These
words of Albert Kahn (1860-1940) could
have served as his motto. This French finan¬
cier invested his immense wealth in an ambi¬
tious humanitarian project which became his
life's work: to reconcile the peoples of the
world through furthering communication,
by all possible means, between those "who
hold in their hands the destiny of nations".
He was one of the first men whose actions
kindled the idea of internationalism.
In 1910, grasping the importance of
photography and cinema as major mediums
for documenting the human heritage, he
decided to draw up, under the title of
"Archives of the Planet", a "kind of photo¬
graphic inventory of the surface of the globe,
as inhabited and worked by man, as it was at
the beginning of the century", in order to
"fix in the memory once and for all the
different aspects of human activity, the cus¬
toms and practices, the inevitable disappear¬
ance of which is only a question of time".
A breakthrough in photographic tech¬
niques had just occurred the autochrome
process, developed by the Lumière
brothers which meant that colours could
be directly reproduced for the first time.
Kahn entrusted Jean Brunhes, pioneer of
human geography in France, with the re¬
sponsibility of directing the missions of
photographers and film-makers who, from
1910 to 1931 (the date of Kahn's financial
ruin), travelled the world and brought back
around 72,000 autochrome plates and some
140,000 metres of film. Far from being taken
at random, these images were intended to be
of great significance, not only in themselves
but also as regards the accompanying
documentary records, which have not yet all
been brought together. The pictures were
later shown to the personalities from all over
the world whom Kahn invited to his home.
Of this inspired innovator, who in the
service of the "planetary" philanthropic mis¬
sion which he felt was invested in him, set up
a number of foundations, bursaries and a
club, Autour du Monde, whose members
widened their horizons by travel, two
memorials remain. The gardens, revealing
inspiration from many lands, which Kahn
laid out at his home in Boulogne-sur-Seine,
France, and the "Archives of the Planet",
now reorganized into a photo-library and a
film-library. The gardens and the libraries
are open to the public.
Three autochromes from this unique col¬
lection are reproduced here in black and
white, and another in colour on page 2. D

has carried out a number of photo reports in
different countries of Africa, Latin America

Humanistic Photography (United States)
for his Latin American report, and in 1985 he
received the World Press Photo Prize from

technologies supplant the old ways, taking
the word "industry" in its widest sense, that
is to say, mechanical and manual "produc¬

visual document illustrating the different
manufacturing processes still in use today.

agricultural production and the mining in¬
dustry).
The underlying idea is that we are today
witnessing the transition from the industrial
age to what could be called the "techno-
atomic" era. During this transition period,
the overall methods of production are com¬
pletely changing. This transformation is it¬
self the historical product of the accumula¬
tion of intellectual, technical and scientific
achievements. It is by continually reflecting
on the nature of work that we make changes
in it. In recent years, we have attached im¬
portance to natural resources and to their
preservation. The decrease in available natu¬
ral resources (raw materials as well as
sources of energy) has obliged us to look
again at notions of productivity and output
and to redefine our needs.
The growing degree of specialization
brought about by high technology means
that man must eventually abandon the tradi¬
tional role of worker-producer, of his own
free will, and replace it with that of observer-
manager. In years to come, these changes in
the role of the worker will even take place in
developing countries.
This photographic survey thus sets out to
be a kind of archive, a visual record of work¬
ing people and their heritage as the 21st
century approaches. In photographing
scenes from an age of production before it
disappears, seeing it as a whole, I hope to
make a small contribution to the age to
come, a testimony for tomorrow's workers,
showing what work was like in our day. D

photographers, and he became one of the young
photojournalists who recorded the events of the
Revolution. He was the author of many famous
photographs of Lenin taken during the latter's
public addresses in the streets or during the Com¬

1 30,000 negatives of the photographs taken by the
Bulla brothers and their father and also some
thirty films.

* ALPERT
Construction Site of the Fergana Grand Canal,
1939. Between 1930 and 1950 an irrigation canal
was dug with picks and shovels in the Fergana
Valley, which extends into the territories of the
Uzbek, Kirgiz and Tadzhik Soviet Socialist Re¬
publics. In the photograph can be seen the musical
instruments which gave rhythm to this Herculean
task. Alpert (1 899-1 98 1) started work in 1 924, first
for the Rabochaya Gazeta and later for Pravda.
Some of his best-known photo reports include his
stage-by-stage accounts of the building of the
Turkestan-Siberia railway and the Fergana Canal.
He worked on the magazine USSR in Construc¬
tion, which attracted the cream of Soviet photo¬
graphic reporting. Alpert was one of the pioneers
of the picture story on a grand scale.
In 1 9 1 7, the October Revolution marked the
turning-point when Russia broke with its
past and staked everything on the future:
photography at that time became a means of
capturing events, working for the Revolu¬
tion and keeping a record. Photographers
such as Karl Bulla and Pyotr Otsup were
pioneers of photographic reporting, and the
chronicle that they began was brilliantly
continued in later years by photojournalists
such as Arkady Shaikhet and Max Alpert.
Meanwhile, portrait photographers such as
Mikhail Nappelbaum and Abram
Shterenberg were inventing their own new
styles.
With Aleksandr Rodchenko, in the 1920s,
photography was in the forefront of modern
art: "We are seeking a new aesthetic, we
must find it and we will find it (rest assured)
..." As the first great virtuoso of photomon
tage in Russia (see page 25), Rodchenko
brought new life to both journalism and
portraiture, through the boldness of his for¬
mal designs and his skill in framing the sub¬
ject. His influence was immense.
Seen through the eyes of these and many
other photographers who were as politically
committed as they were inspired, and who
were witnesses but also agents of the Revolu¬
tion, workers, peasants, leaders and even
large construction sites took on an aura of
universality and their story acquired the re¬
sonance of a prophecy. D
These photographs, with more than 300 others,
are reproduced in Pioneers ofSoviet Photography,

Fire Escape, 1925. Rodchenko (1891-1956) started
out as a painter and graphic artist. After the Re¬
volution, he became a lecturer at the Higher Insti¬
tute of Art and Technique. With the poet Vladimir
Mayakovsky, his friend and intellectual colleague,
he produced posters and books, with the theatre
producer Vsevolod Meyerhold he created scenery
for the stage, and with the film-makers Lev
Kulechov and Boris Barnett he worked for the
cinema. In the 1930s, he became an outstanding
figure in the Oktiabr ("October") art group, a
leading movement in photography and film. He
launched the periodical USSR in Construction in
partnership with his wife, Varvara Stepanova,
with the encouragement of the writer Maksim
Gorky, and supplied it with photographic reports,
including one on the White Sea Canal, and, above
all, page layouts and cover designs. He was also a
leading theorist of the art of photography.
PHOTOMONTAGE
Manipulation of the photograph is as old as
photography itself. The origins of photo¬
montage techniques can be traced back to the
19th century. In the 1920s, however, the idea
was rediscovered by the Berlin Dadaists,
centred on George Grosz and John Heart-
field, and photomontage became extremely
popular. Whether used for Dadaist subver¬
sive art or surrealist fantasies, applied to
political propaganda or to enliven publicity
and commercial art, this medium which
altered normal perception made photogra¬
phy a part of all the avant-garde movements
of the inter-war years. In the USSR, photo¬
montage was a favoured means of expression
in revolutionary art. Above right, one of a

writer Elsa Triolet. Rodchenko made a num¬

images before starting to practice photo¬

NEW PERSPECTIVES
A revolution in seeing' BY ANNE HOY
DAVID
HOCKNEY
is a British artist whose varied creative out¬
put encompasses paintings, prints, drawings
and stage designs as well as photographic
collages and other "cameraworks". Many of
his works are set in his own everyday world
and are filled with recurring themes, such as
Californian swimming pools and portraits of
his friends and members of his family. His
photographic collages have been published
as David Hockney Cameraworks (London,
1984). In David Hockney: A Retrospective
(1988), the volume which catalogues the ex¬
hibition of the same name which is currently
being shown at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, his photocollages form the
subject of a study by Anne Hoy from which
this article is taken.
This abridged version of a text by Anne Hoy is
reprinted by permission of the publishers, The
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, L.A., and
Harry N. Abrams, Inc., N.Y., from the book
David Hockney: A Retrospective organized by
L.A.C.M.A., 1988. Published in the United King¬
dom and the British Commonwealth by Thames
& Hudson, Ltd., London, 1988. Published in the
Federal Republic of Germany by Dumont Buch¬
verlag, Cologne, 1988. © 1988 Museum Asso¬
ciates, L.A.C.M.A.
Up to February 1982 David Hockney
scorned the camera as nothing more than a
recording device. Photographs did not hold
his attention. "You'd never look at a photo
for more than thirty seconds," he said, "un¬
less there were a thousand faces and you
were looking for your mother."
Though he took "holiday snaps" begin¬
ning in 1963 and made photographs as pre¬
liminary studies for his paintings from 1968
on, he considered the camera inferior to life
drawing as a means of rendering "weight and
volume". In his paintings, especially through
1972, he exploited the photograph's intensi¬
fication of effects of light and the flat, daz¬
zling colour of commercial processing but
found photography false to perception and
to the actual experience of time and space.
"Photography is all right," he commen¬
ted, "if you don't mind looking at the world
from the point of view of a paralysed
Cyclops for a split second."
But when a visiting curator left some
packages of Polaroid film in Hockney's
newly decorated house in the Hollywood
Hills, he decided to try to represent its three
spatial areas. What began on 26 February
1982, with a thirty-print composite, grew
into over-life-size, full-length Polaroid por¬
traits of his friends, then into vast photocol¬
lages of famous American scenery and com¬
plex portrait narratives made from 35 mm
prints, and climaxed five years later in a
panoramic Western landscape composed of
more than 600 prints. Between March and
May 1982 Hockney made more than' 140
Polaroid collages. Then, from September
1982 to August 1986, he produced 231
photocollages with Pentax 110 single-lens
reflex and 35 mm Nikon cameras. He has
made no large-scale photocollages since.
In their sheer number and monumental
elaboration Hockney's photocollages are a
major body of work within his career. Of a
piece with his paintings, drawings and
prints, his camera art is sunny in spirit,
personal, even diaristic, in subject matter,
and experimental and spontaneous in
technique.
In his photocollages, as in his other work,
Hockney explores lines and edges; he called
his first exhibition of photocollages Draw¬
ing with the Camera. He also employs
photography as a reproductive tool, like
etching, lithography, or most recently the
office photocopier, but exploits its special
features.
His photocollages are accessible in con¬
tent and means. Indeed Hockney welcomes
the recent imitations of them in American
magazine advertisements and French tourist
promotions. To him these replicas forecast
the "revolution in seeing" he hopes his
camera art will foster.
The revolution Hockney seeks is through
Modernism. In this regard his photocollages
define issues latent in his previous work and
give them unique, spectacular resolution.
"In a way Modernist art hasn't triumphed
yet!" Hockney remarks. "Because we're still
stuck with the Renaissance picture which
is the photograph and we believe it's the
most vivid representation of reality."
Conventional painting and photography,
which ratify one-point perspective, create,
not greater realism, but greater distance be¬
tween spectator and subject, he believes.
And with ordinary photographs the viewer
lacks the compensation of handwork offered
even by perspectival painting, the verisimili¬
tude gained, Hockney says, as "the hand
moving through time reflects the eye moving
through time (and life moving through
time)".
To circumvent these limitations, Hockney
turned to Modernist collaging of many
photographs. As early as 1970 he had taken
photographs sequentially and pasted them
down edge to edge as a means of recording
more information in architectural studies
but without the distortion of a wide-angle
lens. He called these works "joiners".
Eventually he realized "that if you put six
pictures together, you look at them six times.
This is more what it's like to look at some¬
one." He notes that the gaze moves perpe¬
tually, that visual experience is a composite
of shifting views focused by interest and
inflected by concept and memory. Sensa¬
tions of depth and movement are intrinsic to
eyesight, he observes, upholding the defini¬
tion of perception known since Impression-

ism and seen in Cubism. While a single
photograph can encapsulate only a frozen
moment Hockney calls such pictures
"one-eyed" a collage of them suggests the
composite experience of observation over
time.
His photocollages add "Cubist effects to
photography", Hockney says, and the
effects range from witty art-historical refer
ences to ambitious extensions of Synthetic
Cubist drawing, perspective and collage.
"It's our movement that tells us we're
alive," Hockney says. This conviction has
sharpened his use of diverse perspective
means throughout his career, for they sup¬
port or counteract the inherent stasis of the
picture and thus sharpen our awareness of its
illusionism. D

PIERRE
BONNARD
(1867-1947)
Table Scene, c. 1900. The French painter Bonnard
was an amateur photographer from the 1 890s until
around 1920, when he seems to have given up
photography. He only took pictures in the intima¬
cy of his family circle, using the portable Kodak
cameras which became available at the end of the
19th century. Their handiness and flexible rolls of
film meant that spontaneous moments could be
captured. A number of his paintings and book
illustrations were inspired by the photographs he
took. As in his paintings, Bonnard often made use
of unexpected framing to open up the field of
vision and to give the borders of a composition the
same importance as its centre. Similar experiments
with traditional perspective can be found in David
Hockney's work, notably in his photocollages,
where he breaks out of the rectangular framework.

RAGHU
RAI
of India, began taking photographs in 1965
and worked for ten years with a leading
Indian daily newspaper, The Statesman, be¬
fore becoming a freelance photographer. In
1982, he was appointed picture editor of the
magazine India Today, and he has been the
Magnum photographic correspondent in
Delhi since 1 977. His work, for which he has
obtained many Indian and international
awards, has been widely published and he
has held one-man shows in Paris, New
York, Prague, Hamburg and Tokyo. His
publications include Indira Gandhi (1974),
Delhi: A Portrait ofa City (1983), The Sikhs
(1984) and Taj Mahal (Singapore, 1986; Par¬
is, 1987), a selection of colour photographs
of the famous monument with a text by the
Indian journalist Usha Rai.
In the 17th century, the Mughal emperor
Shah Jahän created an architectural marvel,
the Täj Mahal, in memory of his much-loved
wife, Mumtäz Mahal ("Chosen One of the
Palace"), who died in childbirth in 1631 after
having been the emperor's inseparable com¬
panion since their marriage in 1612.
Credit for the original conception of the
mausoleum should no doubt go to Shah
Jahän himself, but Mughal tradition has it
that several architects collaborated in draw¬
ing up the final plans. The chief architect was
most probably Ustad Ahmad Lahori, a
mathematician and astrologer renowned for
his skill in designing buildings of vast dimen¬
sions and perfect symmetry.
The construction of the monument was
begun in 1 632 and took over twenty years. A
team of several thousands of master-builders
and craftsmen, masons, marble-workers, in-
layers, goldsmiths, calligraphers and other
decorators, came from all over India and
Central Asia to work on this large-scale
building project. The chosen site was outside
Agra, on the southern bank of the Yamuna
River, whose course was diverted in order
that the water would reflect and enhance the
beauty of the monument.
This extraordinary mausoleum of lumi¬
nous white marble, with its geometrically-
arranged gardens covering almost 17 hec¬
tares, has inspired poets and writers for over
300 years and still draws countless pilgrims
today. Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian
Nobel Prize-winning poet, described the Täj
as "the guardian of death tenderly covered
with the shroud of memory".
Agra has now become an industrial town
and steelworks have been constructed near¬
by. The ensuing atmospheric pollution is
endangering the Täj Mahal, now included on
Unesco's World Heritage List as a property
of outstanding universal value. The Indian
photographer Raghu Rai has recently taken
a series of colour views of the Täj, adding up
to an exceptional profile that embodies both
the dream and the reality of this masterpiece.
Even when these photographs are trans¬
posed into black and white, as here, the
power of his work remains intact. D

DOMINIQUE
ROGER
of France, has been chief of the Photo Unit
in Unesco's Division for Audio-Visual In¬
formation since 1976. As the Organization's
official reporter-photographer she has
travelled the world, and the results of her
work can be seen in Unesco publications and
international exhibitions. Her personal view
of Venice was the theme of a show entitled
"Venetian Wrinkles" (Paris, 1976; Venice,
1978). Recent exhibitions include "France:
A Loving Look" (Paris, 1985; San Francisco,
1988), and "Colette at the Palais Royal"
(Paris, 1987). She is the author of two books,
published by Unesco, Femmes/Women/Mu¬
jeres (1975, to commemorate International
Women's Year) and Precious Waters (1981).
On 4 November 1966, a tidal storm surge of
exceptional height and duration completely
flooded the city of Venice. The famous St.
Mark's Square was covered by over a metre
of water, a catastrophe that drew world
attention to the growing dangers threatening
the site. The Italian authorities immediately
set up a Committee for the Safeguard of
Venice, and Unesco launched an interna¬
tional campaign to save the city and to study
the choices which have to be made if the
protection of Venice and its lagoon is to be
assured.
The historic city is built for the most part
on piles driven into unstable silt in the centre
of a crescent-shaped lagoon approximately
50 kilometres long by 10 kilometres wide,
separated from the Adriatic Sea by a barrier
of narrow islands and peninsulas. Venice has
always been subject to flooding from the sea
and to the deterioration of its foundations.
However, high tides are increasingly fre¬
quent and the islands are sinking into the
lagoon at a much faster rate than previously.
During the present century, some 2,500
hectares of the lagoon have been reclaimed
for agriculture, a road and an airport have
been built, and new fisheries and industrial
zones have been developed.
This transformation has brought a series
of additional environmental problems, in¬
cluding air pollution, which has already de
faced many monuments and art treasures
from the Venetian past; chemical and biolo¬
gical pollution of the waters, whether from
industrial, agricultural or domestic origin;
and erosion and sedimentation of the lagoon.
The magnificent buildings can be safe¬
guarded only by the overall protection of the
city and the rational management of the
lagoon ecosystem, within a context of con¬
tinuing intellectual, commercial, industrial
and tourist activities. With this in view,
Venice and its lagoon have been included on
Unesco's World Heritage List of cultural
and natural properties of universal value. D

Window on the world
The Unesco Courier aspires to be, above all,
"a window open on the world", through
which peoples and countries can be viewed
on equal terms, irrespective of geographical
position or demographic, economic or poli¬
tical weight, with the main focus on their
cultural riches and their human and ecolo¬
gical problems. The first number of the
Courier, published in February 1948, was in
newspaper format. The change to an illus¬
trated magazine, with covers in colour and a
selection of photographs accompanying
each article, took place in 1954. (Right, the
first cover printed in full colour, showing a
young Amazon Indian girl.) In 1960 colour
pages were introduced inside certain num¬
bers. The print run of the magazine, current¬
ly published in 34 languages, increased from
40,000 copies in 1949 to 400,000 in 1971, and
passed the 500,000 mark in the 1980s. The
readership is estimated at over 2 million. In
forty years, the Courier has published a
range of photographs which aim to give the
widest possible view on the world and which
add up to a visual encyclopaedia of some
30,000 illustrations. Back numbers can be
obtained in microfiche or photocopied form
by ordering from Unesco Headquarters in
Paris, or from microform suppliers in the
United States (addresses at right). In 1987 a
cumulative index for 1948-1986 was pub¬
lished listing all the articles that have
appeared in the Unesco Courier, by subject,
by author and by month (currently available
in French only).

ANDRE KERTESZ
(1894-1985)
Landing Pigeon, New York City, 1960
"This was taken around 59th Street where they had demolished the houses, and I saw a
pigeon flying in and out. The original idea for this photograph dates back to my days in Paris,
where I also saw some old run-down houses and wanted to photograph them with a pigeon.
But the pigeon never came. Here in New York I sat and waited. Time and time again I went
back to the same place, but it was never right. Then one day I saw the lonely pigeon. I took
maybe two or three pictures. The moment was there. I had waited maybe thirty years for that
instant. With the kind permission of the British Broadcasting Corporation
