.Many countries and particularly those
which have only recently emerged from
colonial domination are today engaged in
a rediscovery of their cultural past. They
are anxious not only to preserve ancient
arts, crafts and oral traditions but also
to integrate the forms and values of this
heritage into the cultural patterns of
modern, life. Articles in this issue examine
different aspects of this search for
cultural identity in Africa, Asia, Oceania
and Latin America. Cover shows detail

These bird of paradise feathers form part of an intricate
headdress worn by the people of the New Guinea highlands.
The relationship between birds and men is strongly expressed
in the oral literature and art of Oceanic peoples, especially
those from New Guinea. Men identified themselves with
birds, and many masks and ceremonial costumes used
bird motifs and actual bird plumes to achieve this effect.

THE ANGRY

"
Young writers and artists
are leading
a cultural reawakening
in the Pacific
by Albert Wendt
ALBERT WENDT, of Western Samoa, is an
educator, novelist, short story writer and poet.
A former principal of Samoa College, Western
Samoa, he is now lecturer in Commonwealth
and South Pacific literature and creative writing
at the University of the South Pacific (Fiji).
Among his published works is a novel. Sons
for the Return Home (1973) and a collection
of short stories, Flying-Fox in a Freedom Tree
(1974). A full collection of his poetry entitled
Inside Us the Dead will appear in June 1976.
Mr. Wendt prepared a longer study on the
subject of his anlcle as a paper for the Unesco
meeting on the study of Oceanic cultures held
at Nukualofa (Tonga) in December 1975.
These Islands rising from wave's
[edge-
blue myth brooding In orchid,
fern and banyan, fearful gods
awaiting birth from blood clot
into stone ¡mage and chant
to bind their wounds, bury
their journey's dead, as I
watched from shadow root, ready
for birth generations after . . .
(from "Inside Us the Dead")
I belong to Oceania or, at least,
I am rooted in a fertile portion of
it and it nourishes my spirit, helps
to define me, and feeds my imagin¬
ation. A detached, "objective" analysis
I will leave to the sociologist and all
the other 'ologists who have plagued
Oceania since she captivated the
imagination of the Papalagi (1) in his
quest for El Dorado, a Southern
Continent, and the Noble Savage In
a tropical Eden.
Objectivity is for such uncommitted
gods. My commitment won't allow
me to confine myself to so narrow
a vision. So vast, so fabulously
varied a scatter of islands, nations,
cultures, mythologies and myths, so
dazzling a creature, Oceania deserves
more than an attempt at mundane fact.
(1) Papalagi: a Samoan word meaning
outsiders or non-Oceanians, and often applied
to Westerners.

Only the» imagination In free flight can
hope if not to contain her to grasp
some of her shape, plumage, and pain.
I will not pretend that I know her in
all her manifestations. No one not
even our gods ever did; no one
does (Unesco experts and consultants
included); no one ever will because
whenever we think we have captured
her she has already assumed new
guises the love affair is endless,
even her vital statistics, as it were,
will change endlessly. In the final
Instance, our countries, cultures,
nations, planets are what we imagine
them to be.
In our various groping ways, we are
all In search of that haven, that Hawalki
(mythical homeland of the Maori
people) where our hearts will find
meaning. Most of us never find it,
or, at the moment of finding it, fail,
to recognize it. At this stage in my
life I have found it in Oceania: it is
a return to where I was born, or, put
another way, it is a search for where
I was born:
One day I will reach the source again.
There at my beginnings
another peace
will welcome me.
(from "The River Flows Back"
by Kumalau Tawall,
Manus, Papua New Guinea)
Our dead are woven into our souls
like the hypnotic music of bone flutes;
we can never escape them. If we let
them they can help illuminate us to
ourselves and to one another. They
can be the source of new-found pride,
self respect, and wisdom. Conversely
they can be the aitu (evil spirit or ghost)
that will continue to destroy us by
blinding us to the beauty we are so
capable of becoming as individuals,
cultures, nations.
We must try to exorcise these aitu
both old and modern. If we can't do
so, then at least we can try and
recognize them for what they are, admit
to their fearful existence and, by doing
so, learn to control and live honestly
with them. We are all familiar with'
such aitu. For me, the most evil is r

Carved figures with long faces, narrow
noses, barely indicated eyes and prominent
chins, like this one, are a distinctive feature
of wood sculpture in the Lake Sentani
region of western New Guinea. Related to
male initiation rites, the statues are placed
inside and outside the men's clubhouses
in this region. Lake Sentani artists decorate
a wide variety of objects, from drums and
hooks to household utensils, with highly
stylized plant and animal motifs.

The chill continues. to wound, trans¬
form, humiliate us and our cultures.
Any real understanding of ourselves
and our existing cultures calls for an
attempt to understand colonialism and
what it did and is still doing to us.
This understanding would better equip
us to control or exorcise it so that, in
the words of the Maori poet Hone
Tuwhare, "we can dream good dreams
again", heal the wounds it inflicted on
us, and with the healing will j return
pride in ourselves an ingredient so
vital to creative nation-building.
Pride, self-respect, self-reliance will
help us cope so much more creatively
with what is passing or to come.
Without this healing most of our
countries will remain permanent wel-

artistic talent harmonize in the

held at Port Moresby. Painted
bark panels on façade depict

fare cases not only economically but
culturally. (And cultural dependency
is even more soul-destroying than
economic dependency.)
Without it we will continue to
be exploited by vampires of all
colours, creeds, fangs. (Our home¬
grown species are often more ra¬
pacious.) Without it the tragic mim¬
icry, abasement, and humiliation will
continue, and we will remain the often
grotesque colonial caricatures we were
transformed into by the chill.
As much as possible, we, mini in
size though our countries are, must
try and assume control of our destinies,
both in utterance and in fact. To get
this control we must train our own
people as quickly as possible in all
fields of national development. Our
economic and cultural dependency
will be lessened according to the rate
at which we can produce trained
manpower. In this, we are failing
badly.
"In a flash he saw in front of his
eyes all the wasted years of carrying
the white man's cargo."
(from "The Crocodile" by Vincent Eri,
Papua, Papua New Guinea)
If it has been a waste largely, where
do we go from here?
My body is tired
My head aches
I weep for our people
Where are we going mother.
(from "Motherland"
by Mildred Sope, New Hebrides)
Again, we must rediscover and
reaffirm our faith in the vitality of our
past, our cultures, our dead, so that
we may develop our own unique eyes,
voices, muscles, and imagination.
In considering the role of traditional
cultures in promoting cultural identity
in the Oceanic Islands the following
questions emerge: '
Is there such a creature as "tra¬
ditional culture"?
If there is, what period in the growth
of a culture is to be called "tra¬
ditional"?
If "traditional cultures" do exist in
Oceania, to what extent are they
colonial creations?
What is authentic culture?
Is the differentiation we usually
make between the culture(s) of our
urban areas (meaning "foreign") and
those of our rural areas (meaning "tra¬
ditional") a valid one?
Are not the life-styles of our towns
simply developments of our traditional
life-styles, or merely sub-cultures,
within our. national cultures? Why is
it that many of us condemn urban life¬
styles (sub-cultures) as being "foreign"
and therefore "evil" forces contami¬
nating and corrupting the "purity of
our true cultures" (whatever this
means)?
Why is it that the most vocal
exponents of "preserving our true
cultures" live in our towns and pursue
life-styles which, in their own termin¬
ology, are "alien and impure"?
' Are some of us advocating the
"preservation of our cultures" not for
ourselves but for our brothers, the
rural masses, and by doing this
ensuring the maintenance of a status
quo in which we enjoy privileged
positions?
Should there be ONE sanctified
official, sacred interpretation of one's
culture? And who should do this
interpreting?
These questions (and others which
they imply) have to be answered
satisfactorily before any realistic
policies concerning cultural conserv¬
ation in Oceania can be formulated.
Like a tree a culture is forever
growing new branches, foliage, and .
roots. Our cultures, contrary to the r

^simplistic interpretation of our roman¬
tics, were changing even in pre-
papalagi times through inter-island
contact and the endeavours of excep¬
tional individuals and groups who
manipulated politics, religion, and
other people. Contrary to the utter¬
ances of our elite groups, our pre-
papalagi cultures were not perfect or
beyond reproach. No culture Is
perfect or sacred even today.
Individual dissent is essential to the
healthy survival, development, and
sanity of any nation without it our
cultures will drown in self-love. No
culture is ever static nor can it be
preserved (a favourite word with our
colonizers and romantic elite brethren)
like a stuffed gorilla in a museum.
There is no state of cultural purity
(or perfect state of cultural "good¬
ness") from which there is decline;
usage determines authenticity. There
was no Fall, no sun-tanned Noble
Savages existing in South Sea para¬
dises, no Golden Age, except in
Hollywood films, In the insanely
romantic literature and art by out¬
siders about the Pacific, in the breath¬
less sermons of our self-styled
romantic revolutionaries.
I do not advocate a return to an
imaginary pre-papalagi Golden Age or
Utopian womb. Our quest should not
. be for a revival of our past cultures
but for the creation of new cultures
which are free of the taint of col¬
onialism and based firmly on our own
pasts. The quest should be for a new
Oceania.
Racism is institutionalized in all
cultures, and the desire to dominate
and exploit others is not the sole
prerogative of the papalagi. Even
today, despite the glib tributes paid
to a Pacific Way, there is much racial
discrimination between our many eth¬
nic groups, and much heartless
exploitation of one group by another.
Many of us are guilty whether we
are aware of it or not of perpetuating
the destructive colonial chill, and are
doing so In the avowed interest of
"preserving our racial and cultural
purity" (whatever that means).
To advocate that in order to be a
"true Samoan", for example, one must
be a "full-blooded Samoan" and
behave, think, dance, talk, dress and
believe in a certain prescribed way
(and that the prescribed way" has not
changed since time immemorial) Is
being racist, callously totalitarian, and
stupid. This is a prescription for
cultural stagnation, an invitation for
a culture to choke in its own body
odour, juices, and excreta.
Equally unacceptable are outsiders
(and these come in all disguises
including the mask of "adviser" or
8
"expert") who try to Impose on me
what they think my culture is and
how I should live it and go about
"preserving" it. The colonizers pre¬
scribed for us the roles of domestic
animal, amoral phallus, the lackey, the
comic and lazy and happy-go-lucky
fuzzy-haired boy, and the well-behaved
colonized. Some of our own people
are trying to do the same to us, to
turn us into servile creatures they can
exploit easily. We must not consent
to our own abasement.
There are no "true interpreters" or
"sacred guardians" of any culture.
We are all entitled to our truths,
insights, and intuitions into and in¬
terpretations of our cultures.
To varying degrees, we as indi¬
viduals all live in limbo within our
cultures: there are many aspects of
our ways of life we cannot subscribe
to or live, comfortably with. We all
conform to some extent, but the life-,
blood of any culture is the diverse
contributions of its varied sub-cultures.
Basically, all societies are multi¬
cultural. And Oceania is more so than
any other region on our sad planet.
Let me take just two facets of our
cultures education and architecture
and show how colonialism changed us.
Kidnapped
I was six when / Mama was careless J
She sent me to school J alone J five

One day I was J kidnapped by a band J

Each three-month term / they sent

Mama and Papa loved / their son and J

(by Ruperake Petaia,
Western Samoa)
This remarkable poem aptly de¬
scribes what can be called the "white-
fication" of the colonized by a colonial
education system. What the poem
does not mention is that this system
was enthusiastically welcomed by
A SIDEWAYS LOOK
IN MAORI ART
One of the most striking art objects of
the New Zealand Maoris is the hei-tiki.

worn by Maori women, depicting the
human figure with distorted head, body
and limbs. Jade hei-tiki below, with
sideways-tilted head, is 17 cm. high.
Maori artists also carve elaborate wood
statues of human figures, lizards and
other forms to decorate their houses.

many of us, and is still being continued
even in our independent nations a
tragic ironyl
The basic function of education in
all cultures is to promote conformity
and obedience and respect, to fit
children into roles society has deter¬
mined for them. In practice it has
always been an instrument for dom¬
esticating human kind. The typical
formal educational process is like a
lobotomy operation or a relentless
life-long dosage of tranquillizers.
The formal education systems
(whether British, New Zealand, Aus-"
tralian, American or French) that were
established by the colonizers in our
islands all had one main feature in
common: they were based on the
arrogantly mistaken racist assumption
that the cultures of the colonizers
were superior (and preferable) to ours.
Education was therefore devoted to
"civilizing" us, to cutting us away

from the roots of our cultures, from
what the colonizers viewed as dark¬
ness, superstition, barbarism, and
savagery. The production of bourgeois
papalagi seemed the main objective;
the process was one of castration.
The missionaries, irrespective of
whatever colonial nationality or brand
of Christianity they belonged to,
intended the same conversion.
Needless to say, the most vital
strand in any nation-building is edu¬
cation. But our colonial education
systems were not programmed to
educate us for development but to
produce minor and inexpensive cogs,
such as clerks, glorified office boys,
officials and a few professionals, for
the colonial administrative machine.
It was not in the colonial interests
to encourage industries in our
countries: it was more profitable for
them that we remained exporters of
cheap raw materials and buyers of
their expensive manufactured goods.
So the education was narrowly
"academic" and benefited mainly our
traditional elite groups who saw great
profit in serving our colonial masters
who, in turn, propped them up because
it was cheaper to use them to run our
countries. The elitist and "academic"
nature of this education was not
conducive to training us to survive in
our own cultures.
Colonial education helped reduce
many of us into a state of passivity,
undermined our confidence and self-
respect, and made many of us ashamed
of our cultures, transformed many of
us into Uncle Toms and what the
Trinidadian writer V.S. Naipaul has
called "mimic men", inducing in us the
feeling that only the foreign is right
or proper or worthwhile.
Let us see how this is evident in
architecture.
A frightening type of papalagi
architecture is invading Oceania: the
super-stainless, super-plastic, super-
hygienic, super-soulless structure very
similar to modern hospitals. Its most
nightmarish form is the new-type
tourist hotel a multi-storied edifice of
concrete, steel, chromium, and air-
conditioning.
This species of architecture ¡s an
embodiment of those bourgeois values
I find unhealthy and soul-destroying:
the cultivation and worship of medioc¬
rity, a quest for a meaningless and
precarious security based on material
possessions, a deep-rooted fear of
dirt and all things rich in our cultures,
a fear of death revealed in an almost
paranoic quest for super-hygienic
cleanliness and godliness, a relentless
attempt to level out all individual
differences in people and mould them
into one faceless mass, a drive to
preserve the status quo at all costs.
These values reveal themselves in
the new tourist hotels constructed of
dead materials which echo the spiri- .
tual, creative and emotional emptiness r

, in modern man. The drive is for
deodorized, sanitized comfort, the very
quicksand in which many of us are
now drowning, willingly.
What frightens me is the easy,
unquestioning acceptance by our
countries of all this without considering
their adverse effects on our psyche.
In my brief lifetime, I have observed
many of our countries imitating what
we consider to be "papalagi culture"
(even though most of us will swear
vehemently that we are notl). It is
just one of the tragic effects of
colonialismthe aping of colonial
ways, life-styles, attitudes and values.
In architecture this has led and is
leading to the construction of dog-
kennel-shaped papalagi houses (mainly
as status symbols, as props to one's
lack of self-confidence). The change
from traditional dwelling to box-shaped
monstrosity is gathering momentum:
the mushrooming of this bewildering
soulless desert of shacks and boxes
is erupting across Oceania because
most of our leaders and style-setters,
as soon as they gain power and
wealth, construct opulent dog-kennels
as well.
Our governments' quest for the
tourist hotel is not helping matters
either; there is a failure to understand
what such a quest is bringing. It may
be bringing money through the middle-
aged retired tourist, who travels from
country to country through a variety
of climates, within his cocoon of
air-conditioned America-Europe-New
Zealand-Australia-Molochland. But it
is also helping to bring those bourgeois
values, attitudes and life-styles which
are compellingly attractive illnesses
that kill slowly, comfortably, turning us
away from the richness of our cultures.
I think I know what such a death is
like: for the past few years I have
watched myself (and some of the
people I admire) dying that death.
In periods of unavoidable lucidity,
I have often visualized the ultimate
development of such an architecture
air-conditioned coffins lodged in air-
conditioned mausoleums.
The population of our region is only
just over five million but we possess
a cultural diversity as varied as any
other in the world. There is also a
multiplicity of social, economic, and
political systems all undergoing diffe¬
rent stages of decolonization,* ranging
from politically independent nations
(Western Samoa, Fiji, Papua New
Guinea, Tonga, Nauru) through self-
governing ones (the Solomons, the
Gilberts, Tuvalu) and colonies (mainly
MUD MEN OF NEW GUINEA. With
their dried-mud masks and bodies
smeared with mud, these tribesmen
from Asaro River, New Guinea (above)
offer a fearsome spectacle. They
traditionally adopted this guise to
terrify their enemies. Today this
custom survives largely in the
colourful dance they enact here at a
gathering at Mount Hagen (Central
New Guinea) held every two years.
During this show, thousands of
brilliantly-decorated tribesmen from
all over New Guinea's Central
Highlands take part in displays of
dancing and spear charging. A time-
honoured feature of New Guinea life
is recalled by Port Moresby's Hiri
Festival (right) which commemorates
the great annual trading voyages
made by the Motu people along the
west Papuan coast. Traditional
singing and dancing and canoe races
take place at the festival.

French and American) to our oppressed
aboriginal brothers in Australia. This
cultural, political, social and economic
diversity must be taken into account
in any overall programme of cultural
conservation.
If as yet we may not be the most
artistically creative region in our
spaceship, we possess the potential to
become the most artistically creative.
There are more than 1,200 indigenous
languages plus English, French, Hindi,
Spanish, and various forms of pidgin
to catch and interpret the Void with,
reinterpret our past with, create new
sociological visions of Oceania with,
compose songs and poems and plays
and other oral and written literature
with.
We also possess numerous other
forms of artistic expression: hundreds
of dance styles; wood and stone
sculpture and carvings; artifacts as
various as our cultures; pottery,
painting and tattooing. We have a
fabulous treasure house of traditional
motifs, themes, styles, material which
we can use in contemporary forms to
express our uniqueness, identity, pain,
joy, and our own visions of Oceania
and the earth.
Self-expression is a prerequisite of
self-respect.
Out of this artistic diversity has
come and will continue to come our
most worthwhile contribution to human
kind. So this diversity must be
maintained and encouraged to flourish.
Across the political barriers dividing
our countries an intense artistic
activity is starting to weave firm links
between us.
This cultural awakening, inspired
and fostered and led by our own
people, will not stop at the artificial
frontiers drawn by the colonial powers.
And for me, this awakening is the first
real sign that we are breaking from the
colonial chill and starting to find our
own beings.
As Marjorie Crocombe of the Cook
Islands and editor of Mana Magazine
has written: "Denigrated, inhibited

AFRICAN ART,
WHERE THE HAND HAS EARS
'Every work of art/ says old Africa,
'is like a silent word. Everything speaks.
Everything around us imparts a mysterious
enriching state of being.'
by Amadou Hampâté Bâ
THE meaning which we give
nowadays to the words "art"
and "artist" and the special place
which they occupy in modern society
do not entirely match the traditional
African way of thinking.
"Art" was not something separate
from life. It not only covered all forms
of human activity, but also gave them
a meaning.
Ancient Africa's view of the uni¬
verse was an all-embracing and relig¬
ious one, and acts, particularly acts of
creation, were seldom, if ever, carried
out without a reason, an intention, or
appropriate ritual preparations.
No one who considers traditional
Africa from a strictly secular viewpoint
can hope to understand it.
In traditional Africa there was no
AMADOU HAMPATE BA, of Mall, was a
member of Unesco's Executive Board from
1962 to 1970 and has been his country's
ambassador and minister plenipotentiary to the
Ivory CoastT'He ¡s-çurrently engaged on research
on African history; literature and ethnology,
with special reference to the peoples of the
Niger Bend area. Founder and later director of
the Institut des Sciences Humaines (Institute
of Human Sciences) of Bamako (Mali), he has
published many books and articles about Africa.
His L'Étrange Destin de Wangrin (The Strange
Fate of Wangrin) published in 1973 by Presses
de la Cité, Paris, was awarded the Grand Prix
Littéraire de l'Afrique Noire. He recently
contributed a chapter entitled La Tradition
Vivante (The Living Tradition) to Unesco's
major publication. General History of Africa,
currently in preparation. The author gave fuller
treatment to the subject of the present article in a
study prepared for an International symposium
on "The Artist in Contemporary Society"
organized by Unesco in Paris in July 1974.
division between the sacred and the
profane, as there is in our modern
society. Everything was interconnec¬
ted, because everything was imbued
with a profound feeling of the Unity
of Life, the Unity of all things within a
sacred universe where everything was
interrelated and mutually dependent.
Every act and every gesture were
considered to bring into play the invi¬
sible forces of life. According to the
tradition of the Bambara people of
Mali, these forces are the multiple
aspects of the Se, or Great Prime
Creative Power, which is itself an
aspect of. the Supreme Being known
as Maa Ngala.
In such a context, actions, since they
generated forces, were necessarily
rituals, performed so as not to upset
the balance of the sacred forces of the
universe of which man was traditionally
both the guardian and the guarantor.
The crafts of the iron-worker, car¬
penter, leather-worker or weaver were
therefore not considered to be merely
utilitarian, domestic, economic, aesthe¬
tic or recreational occupations. They
were functions with religious signifi¬
cance and played a specific rôle in the
community.
In the last analysis, in ancient Africa
everything was considered as art, as
long as knowledge of some kind was
involved and also the means and
methods of putting it into application.
Art was not only pottery, painting,
etc. but everything at which people
worked (it was called, literally, "the
work of the hands") and everything
which collectively could contribute to
developing the individual.
These creative activities were all the
more sacred since the world we live in
was considered to be merely the
shadow of another, higher world
conceived of as a mysterious pool
located neither in time nor in space.
The souls and the thoughts of men
were linked to this pool. In it they^
perceived shapes or impressions which
then matured in their minds and found
expression in their words or the work
of their hands.
Hence the importance of the human
hand, considered to be a tool which
reproduced on our material plane (the
"plane of shadows") what had been
perceived in another dimension.
The forge of the traditional ironsmith,
who had been initiated into both gen¬
eral and secret knowledge handed down
to him by his ancestors, was no ordi¬
nary workshop, but a sanctuary which
one entered only after performing spe¬
cific rites of purification.
Every tool and instrument in the
forge was the symbol of one of the
active or passive life forces at work '
in the universe, and could be manipu¬
lated only in a certain way and to the
accompaniment of ritual words.
In his workshop-sanctuary, the tradi¬
tional African ironsmith was thus
conscious not only of performing a
task or of making an object, but of
reproducing, by a mysterious analogy,
the initial act of creation, thus parti- ^
cipating in the central mystery of life, r

W The same was true, of other crafts,
in ancient traditional societies in which
the concept of the "profane" was vir¬
tually non-existent, the craftsman's
functions were not performed for
money or to "earn a living", but
corresponded to sacred functions, to
paths of initiation, each of which was
the medium for a body of secret know¬
ledge patiently handed down from gen¬
eration to generation.
This knowledge was always about
the mystery of the primal cosmic unity,
of which each trade was one particular
aspect and form of expression. There
were a great many craftsmen's trades,
because there were also a great many
possible relationships between man
and the cosmos, which was the great
dwelling place of God.
- While the art of the ironsmith is
linked with the mysteries of fire and
the transformation of matter, the art of
the weaver is bound up with the mys¬
tery of rhythm and the creative Word
acting through time and space.
In ancient times, not only was a
trade or art considered to be the em¬
bodiment of a particular aspect of the
cosmic forces, but it was also a means
of making contact with them. To guard
against an unwise mixing of powers
which might prove to be incompatible,
and to keep secret knowledge within
the family, these various categories of
craftsmen came to practise a system
of marriage within their group, regula¬
ted by numerous sexual prohibitions.
It is plain to see how these chains
of initiation or ramifications of know¬
ledge gradually gave rise, through
marriage within the group, to the spe¬
cial caste system of the area formerly
known as the Bafour (savanna region
stretching from Mauritania to Mali).
These castes enjoyed unique status
within society.
Let us take a look at the middle
class, which particularly concerns us
here, namely the class of the crafts¬
men called, in Bambara, the Nyama¬
kalaw.
Owing to the sacred and esoteric
origins of his functions, the Nyama-
kala could under no circumstances
become a slave, and he was absolved
from the obligation of war service
incumbent upon noblemen.
Each category of craftsmen, or Nya¬
makalaw, constituted not only a caste,
but a school of initiation. The secret
of their art was jealously guarded
within the group and strictly handed
down from generation to generation or
from father to son. Craftsmen were
themselves called upon to adopt a
hereditary way of life, with obligations
and prohibitions designed to keep alive
in t.hem the qualities and abilities re¬
quired by their art.
It cannot be emphasized too strongly
that ancient Africa can be understood
only in the light of an occult and reli¬
gious conception of the universe,
where there is a living, dynamic force
behind the appearances of all people
and objects.
Initiation" taught the right way to
approach these forces, which in them¬
selves, and like electricity, were nei¬
ther good nor bad, but which had to
be approached In the right way so as
not to cause short-circuits or destruc¬
tive fires.
We should remember that the first
concern was not to upset in any way
the balance of forces in the universe,
which, the First Man, Maa, had been
appointed to uphold and preserve by
his Creator, as were all his descen¬
dants after him.
At a time when so many dangers
threaten our planet because of human
folly and thoughtlessness, it seems to
me that the principle thus raised by
the old Bambara myth has lost none
of its relevance.
After the ironsmith come the tradi¬
tional weavers, who also possess a
high tradition of craft initiation. Ini¬
tiated weavers of the Bafour work only
in wool, and all the decorative pat¬
terns on their blankets or tapestries
have a highly precise meaning connec¬
ted with the mystery of numbers and
the origin of the universe.
Woodworkers, who make ritual
objects, notably masks, themselves cut
the wood they need. Their initiation is
thus linked to knowledge of the secrets
of the African bush and of plant life.
Those, who make canoes must also be
initiated into the secrets of water.
Then come the leatherworkers who
are often reputed to be sorcerers and,
finally, also belonging to the Nyamaka¬
law, there is the special caste of djeliw
or "public entertainers" also known as
"griots".
Griots are not only musicians,
singers, dancers and story-tellers.
Some serve as ambassadors or em¬
issaries, acting as intermediaries be¬
tween the great families; others may be
genealogists and historians They have
other roles but those I have indicated
are their principal functions.
The griots as a class do not have
their own initiation rites, although indi¬
vidually they may belong to particular
societies which do have such rites.
But they are nevertheless Nyamakalaw,
since in fact they manipulate one of
the greatest forces capable of acting
on the human soul: the spoken word.
While the nobles are bound by tradi¬
tion to observe the utmost discretion
in word and gesture, griots are com¬
pletely free in this domain. As the
spokesmen and intermediaries of the
nobles they enjoy a special status in
society.

ART OF SITTING PRETTY. In Africa, the line between arts and crafts is less sharply defined
than in other parts of the world. The African craftsman is an artist in the fullest sense of the word.
Everyday objects, such as the two finely-wrought chairs shown here, display the same technical
mastery and wealth of inspiration as works of religious art. Left, farmer's chair from Togo
(78 cms. high). Made of two pieces of wood whose position can be adjusted by means of a slit
pierced through the backrest, it can be easily dismantled. The beauty of the chair lies in its grace,
simplicity and perfect balance. Above, side view of a chair of the Lobi people (Upper Volta) : seat
and back-support have been fashioned in the natural curve of the wood.

L speech, transformers of natural ele¬
ments, creators of objects and forms,
and manipulators of forces, the Nyama¬
kalaw occupied a place apart In tradi¬
tional African society. They fulfilled a
major rôle as mediators between the
invisible worlds and everyday life.
Thanks to them, everyday or ritual
objects were not simply objects but
repositories of power. Such objects
most often served to celebrate the
glory of god and of ancestors, to open
the bosom of the great sacred Mother,
the Earth, or to give material form to
Impressions which the soul of an ini¬
tiate drew from the hidden part of the
cosmos and which could not be clearly
expressed in language.
In the traditional religion-oriented
world, fantasy did not exist. A crafts¬
man did not make something in a spirit
of fantasy, by chance or to satisfy a
whim. The work had a purpose and a
function, and the craftsman needed to
be in a state of mind which matched
the moment of its creation. Sometimes
he would fall Into a trance, and when
he emerged from it, he would create.
In this case the object was not con¬
sidered to be his handiwork. He was
regarded merely as an Instrument or
medium of transmission. People would
say about his work: "God put it into
you", or "God has used you to create
a fine work".
Art was, in fact, a religion, a form
of participation in the forces of life
and a way of belonging to both the
visible and the invisible worlds.
The craftsman had to bring himself
into a state of inner harmony before
beginning his work, so that this har¬
mony might enter the "aura" of the
object and have the power to move
those who saw it.
He was thus obliged to perform spe¬
cial ablutions and recite litanies which
helped to put him "into the right frame
of mind". Once he had achieved this,
he accomplished his task and trans¬
mitted to the work his inner "vibration".
By sculpting, shaping, embroidering,
drawing geometrical lines on leather
or weaving symbolic patterns, the
craftsman gives material form and out¬
ward expression to this inner beauty
which is within him in such a way that
it enters the "aura" of the object, and
captures the attention of those who,
see it for centuries to come. This is
the whole secret of his creation.
"A thing which has not kindled beau¬
ty in you", says an old adage, "cannot
kindle beauty in another who looks
upon it". Artistic creation was there¬
fore the outward manifestation of an
inner vision of beauty which, according
to ancient tradition, was none other
than a reflection of the beauty of the
cosmos. Art was thus priceless be¬
cause this whole creative process was
something that could not be bought.
There are some statues which one
cannot call "beautiful" in the aesthetic
sense of the term, and yet they some¬
times move us more than a lovely
picture, because they are infused with
ANCESTORS AND RAINMAKERS! The M'Bembe people of eastern
Nigeria live in a savanna region where a slow-growing, dense-grained
wood is found. This tough material has led M'Bembe sculptors to
develop a distinctive style, emphasizing only the basic lines of the forms
they carve. Above, M'Bembe statue of an ancestor, relic of the
decoration of a great ritual drum between 400 and 500 years old.
(Our cover shows a detail of this work.) The tree's growth-rings
are clearly visible on the statue, showing that it was carved across
the grain of the wood. Right, two figures of rain spirits ("nommo")
of the Dogon people (Mali). Wrought-iron statues, 30 and 40 cms.
high respectively, their hands are raised in a gesture of incantation,
calling down life-giving rain from the sky.
a power which can attract or repel,
according to the intention behind the
work.
Occasionally, in the bush, one stum¬
bles unexpectedly upon a circle of
statues raised by the Komo (custo¬
dians of traditional customs and be¬
liefs among the Bambara people of
Mali) which seem to have sprung out
of the earth. The shock which they
produce is so strong that unless their
meaning has already been explained to
you, your first instinctive reaction Is
to run away.
An object may also serve as an ins¬
trument for the transmission of know¬
ledge by means of the symbols which
it bears, such as tapestries, whose
patterns may be deciphered, or carved
stools whose geometrical lines have a
precise meaning.
The work of art, whatever form it
takes, is viewed by traditional Africains
as a porthole through which one can
contemplate the infinite horizon of the
cosmos. One can see many things in
a work of art depending on one's own
degree of development. The seer can
use it to contemplate the occult world.
Secular art, which was certainly very
rare in ancient times, differed from
religious art only in the sense that the
secular object was not "consecrated",
and therefore not "loaded" with spiritu¬
al energy. And there can be no '
doubt that an object which has been
consecrated and used for ritual does
not make the same impression as a
secular object on anyone who is at
all sensitive.
Secular art was considered to be
the "shadow" of religious art. It was
the visible tip of the iceberg for the
uninitiated. One example of the
"shadow" role of secular art is the fact
that copies were sometimes made of
religious masks for the Koté, or
traditional theatre.
It goes without saying that secular
art has developed chiefly since the
colonial era and that it has become
very rare to discover an authentic
and spiritually "loaded" object.
As soon as a mask had been
consecrated, in the Komo tradition, for
example, or among the Dogon people,
it could no longer be seen in the open.
It was hidden from the eyes of the
uninitiated and remained either, in its
hiding-place in the bush or, in the case
of the Dogons, In the cave of the
masks. Some Dogon masks are so
meaningful and so sacred that they
are taken out only once every sixty

years for the great Sigui ceremony.
The conclusion to be drawn from all
this is that traditional African art was
not produced haphazardly, and that
it served a central purpose in the
human community.
Most works of art, whether plastic
or in the oral tradition, had several
levels of meaning: a religious meaning,
a meaning as entertainment and an
educational meaning. So it was
necessary to learn to listen to tales,
teaching and legends, or to look at
objects on several levels at once.
This, in fact, is initiation the profound
knowledge of that which is taught
through things, through appearances,
and through nature itself.
Everything which is, teaches through
mute speech. Form is language.
Being is language. Everything is
language.
But, you may say, all that was true
in the past. How do things stand
nowadays?
True enough, the past few decades
have witnessed the destruction, or!
systematic disappearance, of most of
the great traditional initiatory and
craft centres. This has happened for
several reasons: firstly, colonization
policy with its usual and universally
applied tendency of effacing systems
of values and indigenous customs in
order to replace them by its own; next,
the promotion of trade by chambers
of commerce. These, supported by
the authorities, harassed craftsmen
and drove most of the workshops out
of business.
To mention only two examples, the
¡ronsmiths were forbidden to make
certain tools that competed with manu¬
factured products imported from the
colonial mother country and plant-
healers were prosecuted for the
"illegal practice" of medicine.
Gradually, Negro-African art came
to be no longer tolerated except at a
"folklore" level, and, even then, only
If it was remodelled and adapted to
suit the tastes of the rulers.
The trend became even more marked
immediately after independence, with
the general spread of customs and
ideologies imported from abroad and
the invasion of values based on money.
Not only are initiation centres increas¬
ingly rare, but even where masters
still exist, disciples are lacking.
Western-type studies, the attraction
of large neighbouring towns and the
desire to earn money draw young
people like a magnet and carry them
off towards other aspirations.
Traditional African custodians of the
arts, sciences and ancient skills
still exist. But they are few and as
a rule fairly elderly. The treasure of
knowledge, patiently handed down
for thousands of years, can still be
retrieved and rescued if we act while
there is still time and are willing to
listen to what the old sages have to
tell us.
Since Independence, the modern
African artist has been struggling to
assert himself. His search for auth¬
enticity and originality is both difficult
and poignant, for it is not always free
from outside Influence.
Today's African artists are on the
threshold of a new era, during which
they will have a vital role to play. But
the importance of this role will depend
on how they respond to the challenge.
Ideally, no doubt, they should be
able to return to the very roots of
African tradition by seeking Instruction
from the masters who are still
alive instruction not so much in a
technique as in a way of "tuning in"
to the world.
The only message I have for young
African artists is to draw their attention
to the profound meaning of their
ancestral heritage. This would lead
them to take a fresh, more under¬
standing and, above all, more receptive
look at the works of art of the past,
for these were not only "aesthetic"
works (aestheticism had very little to
do with African art) but also a means
of transmitting something transcendent.
Each object from the past is like
a silent word. Perhaps the young
artists of today, more sensitive and
more receptive than most people, will
be able to hear this silent word.
I can only hope that the various
governments concerned, aided perhaps
by international institutions, will realize
the importance of this problem and at
long last recognize the full educational
and cultural importance of the arts.
We live in a very curious age.
The amazing development of science
and technology goes hand in hand,
contrary to all expectations, with a
worsening of living conditions. Along
with the conquest of space has come
a sort of a shrinking of our world,
which has been reduced to its material
and visible dimensions alone, whereas
the traditional African craftsman, who
had never moved from his little village,
had the feeling of participating in a
world of infinite dimensions and being
linked with the whole of the living
universe.
The old African saying goes (and
perhaps the artist of today can hear it)
"Listenl Everything speaks. Every¬
thing is speech. Everything seeks to
inform us, to give us knowledge or an
indefinable, mysteriously enriching
and constructive state of being."
"Learn to listen to silence", says old
Africa, "and you will discover that it
is music."

In traditional African society, every human activity, including
a trade or craft, had a symbolic and sacred quality. Since there
was no division between the sacred and the secular, each craftsman
in working performed a religious function. Each trade reflected
one of the many relationships between man and the universe.

AFRICAN ARTS
TAKE THE HIGH ROAD
AWAY FROM WESTERN ART
by Magdi Wahba
THREE general features appear
to be common to all the indepen¬
dent African countries: their shared
experience of European colonization,
the social mobility of their new élites
and the absorption of their cultures-
into the wider context of politics,
religion or social institutions. If
necessity be the mother of invention
she is also the stepmother of a mono¬
lithic philosophy of social organization.
The poor, the weak, the hungry can
ill afford variety of experience and
expression, nor can they indulge in the
luxuries of disputation. Their lives are
haunted by the spectres of starvation,
poverty, despair and the gruel kitchen.
Nothing else really matters, and it is
against such a background that cul¬
ture must struggle to obtain a precar¬
ious foothold.
Ministries and Departments of Cul¬
ture have sprung up in most African
countries whose aim is to embody
the national ideals and culture in ac¬
tivities, academies and museums, but
the most widespread means of dif¬
fusion is still the radio and, to a lesser
extent, television. The purveyors of
culture find very soon that their best
chance of success is in reducing their
message to an oral one, fitting into
the broadcasting system.
The cosy, ubiquitous transistor has
the virtue of cheapness coupled with
the freedom of privacy. Besides it
fits into the general spirit of oral
tradition which has been the main
transmitter of most of African culture
since time immemorial. The radio is
also the most important means of
dissemination in the Islamo-Arab
MAGDI WAHBA of the Arab Republic of
Egypt is an authority on problems of culture
and education in Africa. A member of the
department of English at Cairo University, he
was Irom 1966 to 1970 an Under-Secretary in
Egypt's Ministry of Culture. He is the author of
Cultural Policy in Egypt, published in 1972 in
Unesco's "Studies and Documents on Cultural
Policies' series.
countries of Africa, where the spoken
word and the traditions of chant,
recitation and song are truly historical
and dominant.
Yet the question may be asked, can
culture be limited to the broadcasting
of words, images or music? Is not the
true repository of culture the printed
word? Roger Caillois, French phil¬
osopher and writer, in a thoughtful
introduction to a Unesco meeting of
cultural policy experts in Dakar in
1969, raised this question with regard
to African culture.
In substance, his words were a cry
of alarm with regard to developing
countries. There was, he felt, a terrible
temptation to skip the stages of
development and to go directly to
television and the tape-recorder,
without passing by reading and
writing. And yet, he maintained, there
is no true substitute for reading and
writing as stimuli for critical thought.
He was convinced that cultural de¬
velopment was closely linked with
schools and universities, with reading
and writing. Is culture, in its broadest,
universal sense not primarily the cul¬
ture of the book?
If such is the case, then there is
little choice, especially against a
background of almost universal pov¬
erty, but to link cultural dissemination
and the preservation of cultural values
with the educational systems of Africa.
Here also may be posed the problem
of the visual arts.
In the European context, after the
age of the great cathedrals, art
certainly became an expression of
individual, identifiable talent. The
artist bore a name and his name was
transmitted down to posterity by
means of a culture based on accumul¬
ated book-learning. In most of Africa,
art has always been functional, deeply
involved in the material, social and
religious needs of the community. But
it is also anonymous.
In North Africa, of the ancient arts
of mosaic, copper beating, marquetry,
and calligraphy, it is the latter only
which has some claim to indi¬
vidualization. In Africa south of the
Sahara the traditional arts are becom¬
ing more and more part of a museum
of folk-arts preserved with some effort
for the benefit of the tourist trade and
the research of the ethnologist.
Oral tradition, also anonymous,
nevertheless survives with much more
vigour, becoming adapted to the
various modern literary forms with
remarkable ease, and thus entering,
as it were, the limelight of an individu¬
ated author.
Again, in North Africa, the romances
of the Arabian Nights and the epic
chronicles of the Hilaliya and the tales
of Antarah have obtained literary
passports to modern respectability
in a variety of literary and dramatic
adaptations, which have lifted them
from the trough of anonymity, but also
cut them off from their social origins.
How many graduates from the edu¬
cational systems in Africa wish to
explore their community and find ways
and means by which they can be
active in enhancing the quality of the
society to which they belong? How ,
many schools or universities for that
matter would happily abandon didac¬
tic for non-didactic methods of ins¬
truction in order to produce a new
generation with an intellectual curiosity
whetted instead of stifled?
One of the causes of the medio¬
crity perpetuated in many African
educational systems is the almost
blind insistence on the transmission of
certitude to wavering consciences.
How can culture, local or universal,
flourish in such a wilderness of
certitudes?
Further questions we might ask are:
What culture? Whose culture?
In the Islamo-Arab North there is a
common language which for historical
and religious reasons subtends a

may be allowed, this is a condition not
to be found easily in other African
languages, with the possible exception
of Swahili in the east and Wollof in the
west. English and French will remain,
for a long time to come, the main
organs of cultural and instructional
transmission in many parts of Africa.
There is something dramatic about
the way in which a civilization of
"orality", based on the perpetuations
of memory, is having to come to terms
with the written word, in English or
French or in the transcription of the
various national languages.
Inevitably, the epic chants and
rhythmic encomia of the "griots" lose
their immediacy when written down or
broadcast on the radio. Anthologies
with introductions by learned anthro¬
pologists are saving oral tradition, but
they are also freezing it in time. Never
has it been more true than now that "an
old man dying is a library going up in
flames", to quote a Malian sociologist
and historian, Amadou Hampâté Bâ
(author of our article on page 12). The
problem of music and the visual arts
is no less dramatic.
In modern Arabic music, before the
revival of the classical heritage, it has
been possible to trace influences as
varied as the rhumbas and tangos of
the 1930s together with the odd bar
here and there from Tchaikovsky or
Beethoven or even Bach. These have
been added, together with such exotic
instruments as the accordion and the
electric guitar, to the classical rhythms
and melodies of traditional Arabic
music without any sense of incompa¬
tibility or strangeness.
And yet Arabic music is not a folk
music in the accepted sense of the
term, nor is it strictly "pop" music.
Its classical repertoire is held as much
in reverence by one hundred million
Arabs as, say, Beethoven's later
quartets are by music-lovers the world
over.
As for the music of Black Africa its
close association of the human voice
with percussion instruments places it
well within that civilization of "orality"
mentioned above. The roots of this
music are in ritual and in folk memory,
and their various attempts to come to
terms with Afro-Cuban, Afro-American
or even plainly Western European
rhythms and instruments have created
what may be regarded as a very
confused mixture of modern dance
music and ritual rhythms.
The integration of the artist into
society cannot be the result of any
special sort of legislation. Artists are
not artificially induced phenomena.
They are often "made", but generally
they are "born", they are there, and
something has to be done about
them.

When Ramses Wissa Wassef, an Egyptian architect, set up a weaving
workshop for teenagers near Cairo, his aim was to integrate art into
everyday life and to improve the status of the craftsman, too often
considered as a manual worker rather than as an artist. (See Unesco
Courier, July-August 1965). Spontaneously and without the help of
preparatory sketches, the young weavers create remarkable tapestries.

artist is often tempted to withdraw
from the traffic of an acquisitive or
an ideology-ridden society. He lays
himself open to the charge of isolation
and sterility, and his work may be
regarded as no more than a creation
of private fancy. This is not a pleasant
situation for the artist, since one of
his main motives is to communicate
and to be appreciated.
The educational systems have to
ascertain, first of all, the ultimate des¬
tination of the artist in African society
before they can be expected to plan
the manner of his training. Almost
inevitably, the artist is to become a
public servant, a teacher or a state-
supported artist.
Perhaps that is why most of the
African educational systems concen¬
trate on the technical training of
schoolchildren in the rudiments of
draughtsmanship, mechanical drawing
and those crayon or water-colour
sketches of themes which inculcate
national pride at an early age and
which grace the walls of so many
exhibitions of schoolchildren's art all
over the world.
Naturally this remark may be re¬
garded as unfairly sarcastic, but the
fact remains nevertheless that these
various practices do not properly
constitute an initiation into the world
of art. They are more in the nature
of tedious exercises akin to the
drawing of maps by young children.
In Egypt, the late Ramses Wissa
Wassef had to face this problem when
he started the weaving centre at Har-
rania outside Cairo, where he en¬
couraged young peasant children to
develop their own artistic gifts. His
first inspiration came from reflection
on the question of the artist and the
craftsman. (See "Unesco Courier"
article, July-August 1965.)
"By defining one as a creator, and
the other as a manual worker", he has
written, "our civilization, with its
conventional classifications, routines
and ill-considered generalizations, has
sundered art and craftsmanship, and
is threatening to strangle both of
them" (1).
The great interest of Ramses Wissa
Wassef's educational experiment is
that it is applicable with slight modi¬
fications anywhere in Africa. Highly
successful and, one might add, ex¬
tremely lucrative for the young wea¬
vers' co-operative, it is also an impor¬
tant contribution to modern philoso¬
phies of artistic education. Easily inte¬
grated into the environment, whether
rural or urban, this experiment pro¬
vides the key for combining the vir-

tues of teaching and play without any
artificiality or concession to outside
influences.
This integration of the arts into what
can loosely be called "life", is very
much part of the general philosophy
of the arts which has flourished in,
Egypt over the last thirty years or so.
Hassan Fathy's world-famous experi¬
ment in building the village of Gourna
in Upper Egypt is another illustration
of the desire to return to the roots
of a culture without sinking into the
pitfalls of folklore.
Here the problem is not strictly the
teaching of an art of self-expression,
but rather the teaching of a craft which
is essential for the welfare of a rural
community the craft of building. Let
me be allowed to describe the problem,
in the author's own words:
"If a village is to be built by its own
future inhabitants, then we must give
them the necessary skills. However
much enthusiasm the co-operative
system may engender, it will do little
good if the people don't know how
to lay bricks. . . We need a method
of teaching the peasant the elements
of practical building so that he can
contribute usefully to the building of
his village, but we don't want to turn
him from a productive farmer into a
skilled but unemployable mason . . .

WHO BUILT
THEIR
OWN VILLAGE
An Egyptian architect, Hassan Fathy, has shown how a community can affirm and
enrich its cultural identity by using ancient skills and materials and adapting them
to modern uses and needs. He did so by teaching the villagers of Gourna in
Upper Egypt to build the houses they badly needed, using mud bricks, a cheap,
locally available material. Using designs which in some cases were inspired by
traditional Egyptian architecture, the villagers were able to construct a beautiful
village whose cool, hygienic and comfortable dwellings combine modernity with
real character. Opposite page, facades of farmers' houses in one of thevillagestreets.

first as the core of the village, we
can make use of the architects and
máster-craftsmen engaged by the
building authority, and they can pass
on their skills to the people. Then,
even if the authority cannot afford to
build many private houses, the skills
will have been implanted, the vil¬
lage centre will be there, and the
inhabitants will be able to go on
for themselves. . . The maturing of
skill is an experience of considerable
spiritual value to the craftsman,
and a man who acquires the solid
mastery of any skill grows in self-
respect and moral stature. In fact
the transformation brought about in
the personalities of the peasants when

greater value than the transformation
in their material condition" (1).
Both Hassan Fathy and the late
Ramses Wissa Wassef had to come to
terms with the problem of integrating
the arts and crafts into a society where
the pressures of sheer survival might
have monopolized the attention of most
people.
This Integration is second nature,
however, In such ritualistic societies
as that of the Mambila on the high
plateau in the province of Sarduana in
Northern Nigeria. For the Mambila
there has never been relief from a
subsistence economy and yet the
arts are lively because of their in¬
tegration into the tribal initiations
which constitute the spontaneous
education of the Mambilas.
The men learn to work on jron,
wood, bamboo and cotton fabrics,
while the women specialize In the most
elaborate basketwork from childhood.

kHairdressing, sculpture and painting
^become so many media for expressing
highly emotional "language" ritualis-
tically.
The techniques and materials of art
are determined by the uses to which
their products will be destined.
There is no pottery or sculpture
among the Peuls of the southern
Sahara, for example, because their
nomadic lives do not permit of such
luxuries, but the rich ornamentation
of their dress makes up for this, pro¬
viding an avenue for extremely com¬
plex artistic inventiveness.
Different environments and social
customs have emphasized certain
purely functional or ritualistic forms
of art, such as mask-painting among
the Chokwes of Angola, and tattooing
in countless hunting communities all
over Africa. Carving In wood or other
materials is also tied up with the ritual
significance of the work of art.
The initiation of the tribal artist is
generally undertaken by the black¬
smith of the village, whose position
is regarded as something between
teacher, technocrat and maker of tools
which he will then use himself in
carving. This Is the case among the
Bambara of Mali, the Baoule of the
Ivory Coast and the Kongo of Zaire.
In the Musée de l'Homme in Paris
there is a great statue of the god
Gu, god of war and patron of all
blacksmiths, which was brought over
from Dahomey during the latter half
of the 19th century. Made of bits of
scrap iron, chain and railway girders
from Europe, it is none the less an
African representation of a dominant
god, whose province is both destruc¬
tion and the making of llfe-perpetu-
ating works of art.
It Is from this foundation of absolute
social integration without any pretence
of exhibitionistic Individualization or
academic drawing, that education
in the arts must begin if it is not to
contribute to a pale parody of western
European art.
Basically, the problem in Africa is
one of coming to terms with the
outside world. It is no use pretending
that nationalism Is enough, or that
cultural resistance can find a modus
vivendi with technological progress.
Nationhood ¡s a fact, not an angry
argument, and the so-called African
"personality" is nothing if it is not the
aggregate of millions of individually
unique personalities.
The true challenge lies, therefore,
In the response to that very simple,
that poignantly simple, Article 1 of
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights: "All human beings are born
free and equal in dignity and rights.

THE CHILDREN
OF THE WHALE
Extraordinary legends
make up the oral traditions
of Siberia's far north
by Yuri Rytkheou
WHY is It that research on oral
traditions, especially those
of the peoples of the North, has
concentrated mainly on tales of fantasy
or on heroic epics divorced from
everyday life? What has become of
all the realistic stories and historical
legends, many of which are sufficiently
precise and authentic to take the place
of written sources?
Could It be that this type of story
represented a mass culture which has
been gradually vanishing like an out-
YURI RYTKHEOU is a Soviet writer whose
work is rooted in the oral folk tradition of his
people, the Chukchi of far eastern Siberia. His
books on the Chukchi have been translated
Into many languages. Among his published
works are The Chukot Saga (1956), The Melting
of the Snows (in Russian, 1958) and A Dream
in Gathering Mists (1959). He has also produced
a collection of Chukchi tales, published In
French with Unesco assistance as Contes de
la Tchoukotka (Les Publications Orientalistes,
Paris, 1974). The complete version of the
present text has just appeared in Unesco's
international quarterly "Cultures" (Volume II,
No. 4, 1975).
dated fashion? I do not believe this
is the case.
I think It would be wrong to consider
the vast store of folklore which has
not been published in collections of
tales and legends as the mass culture
of the era before such stories were
recorded In writing.
We should remember that there was
an unwritten law, a kind of tacit
censorship Imposed by the rules of
society which restricted the diffusion
of these stories. The Chukchi people
of northeastern Siberia, near the
Bering Strait, for instance, have a
proverb about the power of the spoken
word. "A word can kill a man", they
say.
I heard Chukchi tales and legends
from the lips of my grandparents, who
brought me up. As I lay under the
cover of the reindeer-skin rug, my
heart would skip a beat when a passing
guest, come to seek the warmth of our
hearth, began to recount some tale^
unknown to me. "

<![CDATA[
The folk tales of the Chukchi, unlike
modern written literature, contained a
wealth of circumstantial detail about
place and time of year, though the
hero of the tale was seldom named,
only his tribe and the language he
spoke.
How then were books reconciled
with this ancient and familiar art of
story-telling in the traditional setting
of the yaranga, the Chukchi tent of
seal or reindeer skins? When I was
a child, the Chukchi had already
ceased to look on books as an
unfathomable miracle. Some would
speak with a condescending smile of
the time when these solid slabs of
pages were mistaken for the well-
tanned skins of some mysterious
beast, and reading was likened to the
familiar process of nosing out tracks,
with the sole difference that ¡n this
case it was human speech that was
being "nosed out".
But in my childhood books were
already familiar objects; only their
contents were regarded as miraculous.
In the beginning, books naturally
ousted oral folk literature which, along
with the yaranga, skin boats and fur
thigh-boots, was regarded as a relic
of the past, a sign of backwardness.
At the same time we could not
discard folk literature completely.
In my own experience, oral literature
was a constant, familiar element in
our lives, and one which we accepted
as natural. Even at the time when
I was studying at the university and
helping to compile textbooks for
Chukchi schools and anthologies and
collections of stories, for me oral folk
literature was a reality, something
existing and developing Independently.
But it was only when I began my
career as a writer that I was led to
reflect about the role of the oral
tradition.
AD I not studied the history of
I B world literature and attended
lectures on folklore, aesthetics and
other academic subjects, I" might per¬
haps never have pondered on the
sources which were to provide the
roots for my literary work. These roots
went straight back to the oral folk
tradition of my own people.
But there was one thing that made '
me pause: contemporary literature is
so totally different from unwritten lore
and especially the tales, legends and
myths and moral stories of the Chuk¬
chi people. Who would listen to me
recounting these tales, however new
they might be, even if I wrote them
down? And what could I hope to
discern with the help of the artistic
vision of my forbears? Would I not
be like someone attempting to make
new discoveries in astronomy while
using a telescope as . rudimentary as
Galileo's?
At the time when I was writing my
first stories there already existed, in
both Soviet and world literature, a
quantity of works describing the
mysterious life of the land of the
midnight sun, the people of the Arctic
wastes, the realm of ice and snow.
A few books had been written by
captains of whaling vessels who had
observed the life of the shore encamp¬
ments through their binoculars and,
on the basis of what they saw, had
tried to describe the life and character
of the Arctic peoples. Most of the
other accounts of the Chukchi and
Eskimos expressed sympathy with their
struggle for existence, combined with
astonishment and admiration for their
achievements. These books credited
my people with all kinds of real virtues,
now half forgotten, such as their out¬
standing honesty and capacity for
self-sacrifice, their warm hospitality,
their readiness to help the traveller,
qualities described as now rare among
the peoples of so-called civilized
societies.
But surprising as It may seem, my
own feeling when reading these
stories was one of profound and
growing irritation. I could almost see
the well-meaning author making as
though to pat me condescendingly on
the head and with a pitying smile on
his face, offer me a crumb from his
table. It never occurred to him to
invite me to sit by his side, or even
simply to shake me by the hand. His
attitude was one of pity and sympathy
for his younger brother, whom he was
trying, perhaps even sincerely, to help
and please.
There were of course also some
works, European, American and Soviet,
full of genuinely humane feeling. But
all viewed the subject as It were from
outside, and while being enraptured
by It, the authors were no less en¬
raptured by their own nobility.
About the middle of the 1950s
I decided to write a story about a
contemporary of mine, a man who had
discovered modern culture through a
series of astonishing and often dis¬
tressing adventures. I wanted to find
out what happened when a man who
had his roots in an ancient culture
came into contact with a great modern
civilization with all its diversities and
uneven values. So I wrote the book
that was subsequently entitled The
Melting of the Snows.
I delved back into the memories of
my own childhood, to those moments
of vision when I suddenly seemed to
see things with extraordinary clarity.
I found it impossible, of course, to
convey the atmosphere of my child¬
hood days without recapturing my
attitudes and those of the people
amongst whom I lived. And it was
then that I saw how our whole way of
life had been coloured by the oral folk
traditions which formed the back¬
ground of our everyday philosophy.
The whole of The Melting of the
Snows was permeated by the tales
and legends of my childhood days.
And I realized that in a book of this
kind, I could not do without them.
Had I tried to eliminate all the folk
elements, there would simply have
been nothing left. And as time went
on, I found It more difficult to do
without the resources of folklore.
A few years ago, I set to work
on the novel A Dream in the
Gathering Mist. This is the story of a
Canadian man who is to spend all his
life amongst the Chukchi people. Its
principal theme is the brotherhood of
men regardless of their origins, the
colour of their skin and the stage they
have reached on the road to social
progress. j
I had to find a way of enabling the
Chukchi to convey to the Canadian
their ideas about the brotherhood of
man, so I made one of the heroes of
the novel, Toko the hunter, who had
given the Canadian shelter, recount
the ancient legend of the origin of the
seafaring folk, the hunters of the sea.
"...old men say that on these
shores, In days long ago, there lived
a young maiden. And so beautiful
was she that even the mighty sun,
gazing at her in wonderment, remained
always in the sky, and the stars
came out in daylight to behold her.
Wherever she trod, flowers sprang up,
and fountains of water spurted forth.
"The fair maiden went often down,
to the shores of the sea, for she loved
to watch the movement of the waves
and listen to their rippling. The
whisper of the wind and the waves
would sometimes lull her to sleep, and
then the beasts of the sea would
gather on the shore to gaze upon her.
The walruses would come up on to the
shingle, and the seals stared at the
maiden with their unblinking eyes.
"Then one day, an enormous
Greenland whale came swimming past.
His curiosity aroused, by the cluster
of beasts on shore, he came closer
in, perceived the maiden and was so
entranced by her beauty that he
forgot whither he was going, and on
what errand bent.
"And when the sun, exhausted, had
sunk down on the horizon to rest
awhile, the whale swam inshore again,
touched the shingle with his snout,
and turned into a comely youth. The
maiden, seeing him, cast down her
eyes. So the youth took the maiden
by the hand and led her into the
tundra, into the soft gras.';, and lay
with her on a carpet of flowers. And
so It was that, every time the sun sank

down on to the horizon to rest, the
whale swam inshore, turned into a man
and lay with the fair maiden.
"Time went by, and she knew that
she was with child. So the whaleman
built a large yaranga where he took
up his abode with the maiden, and
never again swam out to sea.
"Whale-babies were born, and their
father put them in a small lagoon.
Whenever they swam up to the shore
in search of food, their mother would
,go down to meet them. They grew
¡apace, and soon there was no longer
room for them in the lagoon, and they
began to yearn for the freedom of the
open sea.
"Their mother grieved to see them
go, but all to no avail, for whales are
beasts of the deep. So the whale-
children swam away out to sea; and
their mother conceived once more, but
, this time she bore not whales but
human children. The whale-children
never forgot their parents, and often
swam Inshore to gambol in their sight.
"Time passed. The children grew
up and the parents grew old. The
father went out hunting no more and
his sons procured the food. The first
time they set out to sea, the father
called them to him, and pronounced
these parting words:
" 'For the bold and the strong, the
sea will provide. But remember one
thing: your brothers also live in the
sea as well as your distant cousins the
dolphins and the finback whales.
Never raise your hand against them.'
"Soon after this the father died: and
the mother grew too old to accompany
her sons out to sea. The sons took
wives, and many children were born
to them. They needed more and more
food. So the whale children became
seafaring people Chukchi and Eski¬
mos living by trapping and hunting
the beasts of the sea.
"Then came a year when there was
little game to be caught offshore. The
walruses no longer followed the path
to the village, the seals swam off to
distant parts, and the hunters were
forced to ßo far out to sea where they
perished, some on the Ice-fields, some
in the ocean depths.
"Only the whales were always there,
gamboling merrily off the shore. Then
one day, one of the hunters said:
" 'Why do we not kill the whales?
Just think of all that meat and blubberl
Why, one carcass would suffice for us
all, both us and our dogs, the winter
through.'
" "But have you forgotten, then, that
the whales are our brothers?' the
others objected.
" 'How can they be our brothers?',
scoffed the one who had spoken first.
'They live not on land but in the water,
they have long, ungainly bodies and
they know not a word of human
language.'
" 'But legend says ..." protested
the others.
" 'A fine lot of old wives' tales . . .
the first hunter cut them short, and
went off to prepare his boat, taking
all the most skilled and stalwart
oarsmen along with him.
"Catching a whale presented no
problem, for they all swam up to the
boat, as they always did when they
saw their brothers putting out to sea.
But this time their trust spelled death
to one of their number.
"Once harpooned, It was a long
struggle, to drag the whale to shore,
and all the folk of the village, including
even the women and children, were
summoned to help.
"The man who had caught the whale
entered the yaranga to tell his mother
of the prey he had captured for the
people. But she already knew and
was dying of grief.
" 'I have killed a whale', he said as
he came in, "a solid mass of meat and
blubber."
" 'It Is your brother you have killed',
his mother replied, 'and if today you
are ready to kill your brother just
because he looks different from
you, what will you be ready to do
tomorrow?'
" "And so saying, she breathed her
last."
B;I Y using this ancient fable in my
novel, I was able to convey my
meaning without boring my readers
with a long didactic exposition.
There is of course nothing novel
about my discovery that works of oral
tradition may often be the only means
of reaching the modern reader, and
indeed increasing numbers of Soviet
writers are adopting this device.
It is impossible, for instance, to
conceive of Chlnghiz Aitmatov's tale,
The White Steamer, stripped of the
poetic legend of the Horned Deer
Mother, the ancestress of the Kirghiz
people.
Aitmatov has, I think, succeeded in
making the best possible use of the
ancient myths of his people, and he
has found the ideal solution to the
problem of the modern writer and oral
folk tradition.
The writing of the other newly
literate peoples of the Soviet Arctic
has developed along roughly the same
lines. Many of their writers are my
contemporaries, personal friends of
mine, and most of them studied with
me in Leningrad. But for all their
similarities, they differ widely from
one another both in the character of
their work and in their attitude to our
oral folk traditions.
Vladimir Sanghi, who Is of Nivkh
nationality, was born on the Island of
Sakhalin, in the easternmost part of
the Soviet Union. He was steeped
from earliest childhood in the en¬
chanted atmosphere of Nivkh oral
poetry with which are blended elements
of the culture of the North Pacific
Ocean, the transitional zone between
the warm tropical waters and the
frozen Arctic seas.
Sanghi, after completing his studies,
returned to Sakhalin and began to
make a collection of the island folklore.
He started his literary career by
publishing folktales in Russian and his
native language, and in this way he
discovered his vocation as a writer.
THE Mansi poet Yuvan Shestalov
belongs to a people of hunters
and reindeer breeders living in the
Arctic foothills of the Urals. The
Mansi, like the neighbouring Khanty
people, belong to the Finno-Ugrian
linguistic group. As a poet, Shestalov
draws deeply on the treasures of his
native folklore. Some of his poems
and song-cycles are based wholly on
subjects taken from oral poetic tra¬
dition, while others are simply a
transposition of folk legends.
So it Is clear that oral folk tradition
plays a considerable part in the
modern literature of the newly literate
peoples, even though writers rarely
draw on this material when dealing
with present-day society on the
grounds that it provides no solutions
for the urgent problems of our time.
And yet contemporary literature offers
many examples of the use of mytho¬
logical themes for the solution of vital
artistic problems.
But the question still remains as to
how to use this invaluable material
for the enrichment of contemporary
culture, how to find a place for it not
only in books, archives and recordings,
but also as a source for literary
creation. And this is a question to
which I can see no simple answer.
Indeed, there probably can be none,
for every modern writer evolves his
own individual attitude to the rich oral
heritage of his own people.
Yet a return to one's origins, to the
unsullied sources of folk art nearly
always leads to new artistic dis¬
coveries. No works of man breathe
such joy and optimism, such faith in
the triumph of good over evil, such
subtle humour and such sensitive
understanding of social harmony and
justice as we find in oral folklore.
These, I believe, are the qualities
that for countless centuries have
enabled oral folk traditions to shape
the attitudes of each new generation.

THREE IN ONE
Latin America's originality as a continent
of Indian, African and Iberian
racial and cultural mixture
THE vast ensemble of land,
history and peoples which we
call (inappropriately to say the least)
Latin America has a great variety of
distinctive characteristics. Racial inter¬
mixture (mestizaje) is its most typical
and striking feature.
This word, discredited because of
the derogatory connotations given to

in reality implies much more than a
simple question of mixed blood.
It Is true that there has been a
considerable and significant inter¬
mingling of peoples in Latin America
during the past five centuries of its
history. The Spaniards Interbred
with the Indians. In fact the first
direct contact between Indian and
European was probably that of rape
and from the earliest days there were
countless mestizos born throughout
the length and breadth of the Spanish
Empire in the Americas.
The rise of new institutions and
political structures in the centres of
power In Lima, in Mexico City and
in Santo Domingo was contemporary
with the appearance of a large mestizo
population. But Spaniards and Indians
were not alone In this Intermingling
of peoples. Soon black slaves
appeared on the continent, forming
the principal If not the sole labour
force on the plantations, in cattle-
raising and in domestic service.
This intermixing of races, practised
to varying degrees depending on the
period or the region, was both wide¬
spread and significant. More import¬
ant than Its social effects, however,
was a much less visible and far more
profound process the meeting, con¬
frontation and fusion of living cultural
heritages.
The dominant and characteristic
heritage was brought in the 16th and

17th centuries by the Spaniards, in
the form and image of a closed
hierarchical society with its seigneurial
order, its Catholic faith, a disposition
for belligerence and mysticism, and a
scorn for work and manual occupations.
The second heritage was that of the
great indigenous civilizations, static
and marked by a concept of work,
order and values that was un-
assimilable in the new social context.
Finally appeared the heritage of the
Negroes from the west coast of Africa.
They were wrenched from a variety of
cultures and ethnic groups, thrust
forth from the holds of slave ships,
with their languages, beliefs, songs,
dances and traditions, and brought
face to face with two other cultures
in an unknown environment.
These three cultural heritages met
in confrontation and intermingled to
form an amalgam which was not
confined to particular areas but spread
in varying degrees throughout the
entire continent, forming the sub¬
stratum of its social and cultural life.
The encounter of these three
historical forces on this vast new
geographical stage wrought great
changes In each of them, and In time
forged the dominant characteristics of
the new society.
The Spaniard who had come to the
Indies was subjected to far-reaching
changes which affected almost every¬
thing he did. He soon ceased to
resemble those who had remained
behind in his native peninsula. His
language, his food, the rhythm of his
life, his relationships in work and his
place in the hierarchy all changed.
More often than not he had to learn
to live in a tropical climate, or in the
shadow of the all-pervading forest or
at heights where it was difficult for
him to breathe. The absence, at first,
of cows, oxen and beasts of burden
made his adaptation to the new
circumstances a traumatic experience.
Instead of wheat and beef he had to
eat new foodstuffs, Including hitherto
unknown South American produce
such as the potato, the yucca, the
tomato and maize.
The chroniclers of that time echo
the astonishment of the Spaniard faced
with this new experience. They tell
of the need to eat "roots" and they
seek Ingenuous metaphors to describe
and name new fruits such as the
guava, the avocado pear, the annona,
the coconut and the pineapple.
New objects brought with them
strange names. The Spanish language
became host to South American neo¬
logisms which not only designated new
things but also described new relation¬
ships. Words such as cannibal, hurri¬
cane, canoe, hammock and cacique
were destined to pass into all the
European languages. When the
Spaniard who had lived in South
America returned to Europe he was
considered a foreigner and given the
name "Indiano".
No less fundamental was the
change experienced by the Indians and
the Negroes. They were subject to
the working relationships of Europe
and to forms of servitude which they
had not known in the past. They saw
new types of -buildings arise" incor¬
porating Spanish and African features.
They became acquainted with articles
of furniture they had never seen
before, such as the bed, objects such
as the saddle, strange drinks, a new
language, new ways of behaviour, a
radically different form of worship and
an unaccustomed mode of dress.
Those who were born in the 'new
environment created by the mingling
of the three races were subject to the
continual interaction of the three
cultures. A child such as Garcilaso
de la Vega, called "El Inca" (1539-
1616) who was to be one of the
greatest chroniclers in Spanish of his
time, was born and brought up in a
house in Cuzco (Peru) that was typical
of this mixing of cultures.
In one wing his father, Captain Se¬
bastian Garcilaso de la Vega discussed
with his comrades in arms, his friars
and his counsellors the affairs "of
Castile and Almería from the view¬
point of an expatriate Castilian. In
another, his mother, the Inca Princess
Isabel Chlmpu Ocllo with her relatives,
members of the last Inca royal family,
would converse In the Quechua
language, recalling the annals and past
grandeurs of the Incas. .
A difficult and constant process of
interpénétration of these two contrary

The clothes worn by the Indians of Tarabuco In Bolivia are an
example of the assimilation and transformation of various aspects
of Hispanic culture in Latin America. As well as his cloak, the
traditional "poncho", this Indian wears a hat whose shape recalls
the helmets of the conquistadors. The instrument he is holding,
a charango, resembles the small Spanish guitar known as the
bandurria, although it is higher-pitched and has fewer strings. At
festival time, the Indians of Tarabuco wear spurs, possibly another
reminder of the conquistadors, to beat out their dance-rhythms.
visions of the world went on in the
child's mind, shaping a mentality and
a sensibility that could never be
completely either that of an Indian
or that of a Spaniard. It was this
particular sensibility and vision which
later enabled him to write his "Royal
Commentaries of the Incas", the first
great original testimony of the New
World as it faced Europe, and the first
expression of an awareness of what
it meant to be a Hispano-Amerlcan.
Two and a half centuries later, in
a house in Caracas (Venezuela), a boy
named Simon Bolivar was to inherit
the combined legacy of the three
races, by now mingled and modified.
His governess during the deeply
formative years of his childhood was
one of his family's slaves, a Negress
called Hipólita. Many subconscious
traces of the songs and fables that the
slave retained from her remote African
heritage must have remained in the
mind and sensibility of the future
Liberator of Latin America.
Years later, returning from his
extraordinary liberation campaigns
which had carried him as far as the
high-plateaux of Bolivia and Peru,
Bolivar was making a triumphal entry
into Caracas when he noticed Hipólita
among the crowds pressing round to
acclaim him. He immediately dis¬
mounted from his horse and went and
hugged her to the astonishment of all
around him.
This process of mingling and trans¬
formation extended to all aspects of
life.- Nothing could be adapted
and transplanted without undergoing
changes and modifications arising
from the interaction of the three
cultural heritages and the geographical
environment.
The mixture of influences was not
identical in all Its social aspects nor
in all countries. In music the presence
of the Spaniard and the Negro was
more predominant than that of the
Indian. The Spanish guitar and the
African drum began a long counter¬
point which has still not drawn to an
end and which has created original
rhythms and songs that have spread
across the entire world.
In architecture and decoration, how¬
ever, the influence of the Indian was.
more apparent than that of the Negro.

.The great blossoming of architectural
forms which has been called the
"baroque of the Indies" is one fruitful
instance and proof of this. All over
Latin America,. from the high-plateaux
of the Andean cordillera to the
Mexican meseta, admirable examples
exist of this new sensibility. The
baroque facade was endowed with a
fresh gracefulness and a wealth of
decoration wrought by local craftsmen.
Buildings such as the Church of
La Compañía in Quito (Ecuador) or
the Sanctuary of Ocotlan in Mexico
could never have seen the light of
day In Spain. The ruins which stand
in the forests on the sites of former
Jesuit missions in Paraguay are the
result of this remote and far reaching
encounter which took place throughout
South America.
The meeting of these cultures led
to their separation from their original
sources at a historic period in their
evolution. This too was part of the
great process of transplantation and
confrontation. Thereafter, Negroes
and Indians were cut off from any
further developments in the cultures
from which they had sprung.
This was true also for the Spaniards.
Spanish culture in Latin America
tended to become outmoded and to
lag behind the later changes that
occurred in Spain. In some cases
communication between the two conti¬
nents was inexistent and in others it
was slow and incomplete.
The Spain of the 17th century lasted
much longer in Latin America than it
did in the Iberian peninsula. The
changes introduced by the Bourbons
not only concerning customs and
values but also language reached
Latin America late and incomplete. A
Hispano-American of the 18th century
spoke a Spanish which was dated and
retained customs and tastes which in
Spain had almost disappeared.
Cultural intermixture and a different,
slowed-down historical "tempo" have
since been fundamental and lasting
characteristics of the whole of Latin
America.
This is not, however, a passive
originality created by contrasting
factors or a fortuitous mingling of
foreign elements. «It is an originality
that comes from a positive awareness
and acceptance of enrichment from
other sources which Is exemplified in
all the great epochs of Latin American
cultural creation, be It the "baroque of
the Indies" or modernism In literature.
Modernism flourished in Latin
.American letters between 1880 and
1914 and produced personalities as
outstanding as the poet and author
Ruben Dario. Here we have a man
born in the shadow of the volcanoes
of Central America, in a remote
corner of Nicaragua where cultures
mingled, who not only managed to
produce a miraculous symbiosis of
the most traditional and the most
modern in European letters but was
Photo © Vautier-Decool, Paris
also responsible for the greatest and
most fertile upheaval ever experienced
in the literatures of Spain and Latin
America.
Neither Spain nor any other Euro¬
pean country could have given birth
to a man like Dario. His native
cultural environment taught him to
receive and combine ancient and
modern, Spanish culture and Indian
culture, tradition and innovation,
standing apart from schools and
periods, with none of the historical
limitations of Europe.
The break for which Dario was
responsible was not the result of
dissension between various "schools"
but sprang from a free acceptance of
the whole varied, and even contradic
tory, cultural universe which was his
as a Latin American. He was able to
draw on what belonged to yesterday
and what belonged to today from the
heritages of the Chorotega Indians and
the Castilians of the past to the French
Influence of his own time, without feel¬
ing that he was breaking any bounds
or infringing any temporal standard.
This accretion of sources and this
mingling of periods and styles can be
found in all the major creations of
Hispano-American art. What in recent
years has been called the Latin Am¬
erican "literary boom" is nothing more
nor less than a somewhat belated
discovery, in the work of certain major
writers, of this mingling which, bowing
to European standards, some have

CARNIVAL IN ORURO (BOLIVIA)
The fusion of different cultures which has accompanied ethnic intermixture in Latin
America is one of the continent's most distinctive characteristics a unique, creative
process still going on today. The builders of the Church of Santa Prisca in Taxco near
Mexico City (opposite page) were influenced by and incorporated Spanish architectural
features in the building. But they transformed the baroque of the Iberian peninsula
into a rich, exuberant style that is characteristically Latin American. Above, carnival
scene at Oruro (Bolivia). The black-painted faces of the dancers and the shape of the
drums they beat recall the presence of the African Negro in Bolivia and his influence on its
life and culture. From the 18th century African Negroes settled in Bolivia's yungas
(tropical valleys) to escape the harsh climate of the high Andes and the arduous working
conditions of silver and tin mines situated at altitudes of up to 4,000 metres.
called "baroquism". In this particular
case, rather than "baroquism" it
should be called Hispano-Americanism.
In my opinion this is the great
contribution of the veritable creative
originality of Latin America to western
civilization. Western civilization is
the offspring of a wider and more
complex mingling which has gone on
for fifteen centuries between the
most contradictory of heritages and
influences.
The incredible and, at times, almost
Irreconcilable mixture of the Latin and
the Germanic, the Christian and the
pagan, created new cultural forms and
new languages. Into the melting pot
were cast German traditional law and
Roman Law, primitive beliefs and
Christianity, the poetic genealogy of
Barbarian deities and Jewish prophecy,
along with Greek philosophy, the
aesthetic norms of the classical world
and the concepts of a vast mosaic
of nomad tribes and primitive peoples.
From this amalgam sprang Roman¬
esque and Gothic and from It came
the languages of today. From this
source, too, came the fundamental
characteristics of the first civilization
which was to spread throughout the
entire world.
This process came to an end in
Europe many centuries ago. We could
perhaps say that it ended with the
Reformation and the Renaissance
which to a certain extent stabilized
and guided the future of Europe. But
today the only great ensemble of lands
and peoples where this process
continues with full creative force is
Latin America.
From Mexico to Argentina this
vast formative process Is still going
on with an intensity that varies from
region to region, characterizing the
identity and vocation of this entire
family of peoples. The great cultural
currents of the original three sources
and the others that joined them In the
making of the New World are today
developing, in fruitful and unexpected
associations, their capacity to produce
new possibilities of existence and
expression. '

nor a "Far West" but a metamorphosis
'of what is Western on a stage open to
the influence of all that is non-
Western. This has never happened
elsewhere during any of the great
periods of the global expansion of
western culture.
Throughout most of Asia and Africa
the European presence had a marked
impact but it remained superimposed
and separate, as a kind of historical
exile which reproduced European life
and forms on top of the unasslmilated
and even segregated cultures of the
African and Asian peoples. In Asia
and Africa the original culture and
peoples were submerged under the
superimposed imported structures of
the countries and societies of Europe.
Only in Latin America do we find
a living process of cultural Intermin¬
gling similar to that which produced
the culture of the Western world.
And this is not only its principal origi¬
nality but also its most important
contribution to the cultural future of
the world society of tomorrow. In no
other part of the globe is there a
comparable example of the creative
interaction of different cultures.
The capital importance of this
process has been underlined by many
illustrious Latin Americans. Bolivar,
in the days of his struggle for the
political freedom of the South
American continent, spoke of this
characteristic and its consequences.
He even declared that Latin America
constituted a sort of "microcosm of
mankind", "neither Indian nor Spanish"
and that its full flowering on the scene
of history constituted "the hope of
the universe".
This ¡s a trait of major importance
for a vast family of peoples at a time
when the world is. advancing toward
the broadest forms of co-operation
and integration which have ever been
envisaged.
Today we talk of continental
integration and global systems of
International co-operation, and yet
constantly come up against the diffi¬
cult obstacles which history has
placed between peoples of the same
continent.
Europe and Asia are complicated
mosaics of languages and sub-cultures,
of religious differences and old
quarrels of identity which are a major
hindrance to the process of integration.
None of these conflicts exists in
Latin America. Shared by two sister
languages Spanish and Portuguese
which are practically identical means
of communication, Latin America has
one dominant creed and a similar
cultural past. Today it constitutes
the largest family of peoples united
by a community of language, culture,
religion, history and territory. Its
present population of almost 300
million will rise to 500 or 600 million
by the year 2000. The most elemen¬
tary sense of unity and collaboration
should transform their continent into
one of the most significant theatres of
future world history.
From the Tropic of Cancer to the
Antarctic, from the summits of the
Andes to the coasts of the Pacific
and the Atlantic, with every kind of
climate and type of soil, with all the
natural resources, land and water
necessary for immense development,
Latin America is today the world's
greatest reservoir of geographical inte¬
gration and united peoples. Moreover,
Its tradition of racial intermixture
enables it to draw close to and freely
communicate with all the cultures of
the modern world.

crippled cosmos, than of our actual
islands. I am not saying we should
reject such a literature, or that papalagi
should not write about us, and vice
versa. But the imagination must
explore with love, honesty, wisdom
and compassion.
Writers must write with aroha, aloha,
alofa, loloma (1), respecting the people
they are writing about, people who
may view the void differently and who,
like all other human beings, live
through the pores of their flesh and
mind and bone, who suffer, laugh, cry,
copulate, and die.
In the last few years what can be
called a South Pacific literature has
started to blossom. In New Zealand,
Alistair Campbell, of Cook Island
descent, is acknowledged as a major
poet; three Maori writers Hone
Tuwhare (poet), Witi Ihimaera (novel¬
ist), and Patricia Grace (short stories)
have become extremely well known.
In Australia, the aboriginal poets
Kathy Walker and Jack Davis continue
to plot the suffering of their people.
In Papua New Guinea, "The Crocodile"

to be published has already become
a minor classic. Also in that country
poets such as John Kasaipwalova,
Kumalau Tawali, Alan Natachee, and
Apisai Enos, and playwrights like
Arthur Jawodlmbari are publishing
some powerful work.
Papua New Guinea has established
a very forward-looking Creative Arts
Centre, which is acting as a catalyst
in the expressive arts movement, a
travelling theatre, and an Institute of
Papua New Guinea Studies. Kovave
Magazine, put out by a group of Papua
New Guinea writers, is already a
respected literary journal.
Mana Magazine and Mana Publi¬
cations, established by the South
Pacific Creative Arts Society, have
been a major catalyst in stimulating
the growth of this new literature,
especially In countries outside Papua
New Guinea. Already numerous
young poets, prose writers and
playwrights have emerged. Some of
them, we hope, will develop into major
writers.
Our ties transcend barriers of
culture, race, petty nationalism, and
politics. Our writing is expressing a
revolt against the hypocritical and
exploitative aspects of our traditional,
commercial and religious hierarchies,
colonialism and neo-colonialism, and
the degrading values being imposed
from outside and by some elements
In our societies.
In the traditional visual arts there
has been a tremendous revival. That
revival Is also finding contemporary
expression in the work of Maori artists
such as Selwyn Muru, Ralph Hotere,
Para Matchltt and Buck Nin; in the
work of Alol Pilioko of the Wallis and
Futuna Islands, Akis and Kauage of
Papua New Guinea, Aleki Prescott of
Tonga, Sven Orquist of Western
Samoa, Kuai of the Solomons, and
many others.
The same is true in music and
dance. The National Dance Theatres
of Fiji and the Cook Islands are
already well known throughout the
world.
This artistic renaissance is enriching
our cultures further, relnforcinq our
identities, self-respect, and pride, and
taking us through a genuine de¬
colonization; it is also acting as a
unifying force In our region. In their
individual journeys Into the void, these
artists, through their work, are ex¬
plaining us to ourselves and creating
a new Oceania.

Cultural policies in Africa
A Unesco-sponsored Intergovernmental
Conference on Cultural Policies In Africa,
meeting recently In Accra (Ghana) studied
a wide range of subjects ranging from the
role of African languages and the mass
media to the relations between culture and
development, education, technology and the
environment Speaking of education in
Africa today, Unesco's Director-General,
Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, told the con¬
ference: "Any educational system must en¬
sure the preservation and the transmission
of the values of a given society. Thus
Unesco encourages its Member States to
define educational policies which corres¬
pond with their own realities and to the
needs of their economic, social and cultural
development. Modern education cannot
therefore ignore African languages and
should require knowledge and mas¬
tery of them".
Elm tree disease:
an ecological disaster
Millions of elm trees in Europe and
North America died In 1975 of a new strain
of Dutch elm disease. In this ecological
disaster nearly 2 million elms died in south-
em England last summer alone. Dutch elm
disease, so named because it was first
identified and studied In the Netherlands
50 years ago, Is caused by a beetle which
Implants a poisonous fungus under an elm's
bark. The tree fights back by producing
a gummy antibody which clogs its sap
passages, starving it of water and nutrient
so that it chokes Itself to death. No cure
or preventative is known, and scientists
are currently seeking disease-resistant elm
varieties.
Sharing works of art
A 13th century carved ivory comb, current¬
ly delighting visitors to New York's Metro¬
politan Museum of Art, will travel to Paris.
In 1978 for a five-year stay at the Louvre
Museum. The comb, which will alternate
visits to each city, was bought Jointly by
the two museums in 1972. Such "co-
ownership to expedite art exchanges bet¬
ween countries " Is urged in a Unesco
proposal to be studied by specialists from
different countries at a forthcoming Paris
meeting.
Mediterranean pollution
Ninety per cent' of the sewage of the
Mediterranean basin is piped or dumped
into the sea untreated, reports Paul E. Ress
in "Unesco Features". Other pollution
comes from dangerous heavy metals and
chemicals dumped by industrial plants. The
mercury level In some species of fish, for
example, Is close to or above the safety
level recommended by the World Health
Organization.
Engineers
and the environment
The effects of engineers' and technicians'
work on the environment will be a major
theme of a Unesco-organlzed international
conference on the education and training
of engineers and technicians, to be held
in New Delhi (India) from 20 to 26 April
1976. The meeting will also discuss how
to adapt technology to local needs in the
developing world, the need for revising
training programmes, and how to promote
closer co-operation between education and
Industry.
Old arts
via new media
Unesco is supporting research Into ways
of adapting old arts to new media. During
1976 a workshop will be held in Salzburg
(Austria) to look Into the problems of con¬
verting stage plays for television. It Is being
organized jointly with the International Ins¬
titute for Music, Dance and Theatre in the
Audio-Visual Media. In India, the Theatre
Institute of the University of Chandigarh
is to adapt ancient legends to modern thea¬
trical presentation, calling on artists from
neighbouring Asian countries as well as
India.

THE UNITED NATIONS
AND WORLD PEACE
Sir,
Your November 1975 Issue reminded
us, in your usual graphic and moving
way, of the awfulness of the 1939-45
war, of the U.N.'s contribution to the
peace, and of the relentless preparations
being made for the eventuality of yet
another world war.
I believe that we are unlikely to get
much disarmament except reciprocally
with a general growth in international
co-operation and in the mutual trust
which this should engender. The dis¬
tressing thing is that while the U.N. has
headed up an impressive growth in
international co-operation, extending
from purely technical matters such as
telecommunications to huge undertak¬
ings like a global strategy for attaining
a new economic order, this co-operation
is not producing a fully reciprocal in¬
crease in mutual trust. The reason for
this is simply the phenomenon of the
arms race itself.
Any natural increase in trust which
should accrue from co-operation is stul¬
tified: between the super powers by the
determination of one or the other to hold
the advantage; and between all other
countries by the economic and political
temptations to sell and buy more and
more weaponry, including potentially
dangerous nuclear reactors.
Surely the General Assembly must
soon become deeply alarmed at the
dreadful dangers into which the human
race is drifting. This Is now our main
hope, since the various alliances and
the parties to strategic balances have
had their chance and have failed to
arrest this drift. It is also a reasonable
hope, for the General Assembly has
recently shown it has the patience, skill
and responsibility to arrive at a global
consensus on the outlines of a new
international economic order. If it can
do that, might it not be able to nego¬
tiate a consensus for survival?
The General Assembly might take an
initiative on each of the three main
elements in the overall danger.
First, the arms race between the su¬
per powers. This is leading to the
invention of ever more horrific weapons
of destruction. It has led to the distor¬
tion of the entire economies of the super
powers and to the waste of vast human
and material resources which are ur¬
gently needed to redeem half the
world's poverty.
The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
seem to be getting nowhere because
one side or another insists on superio¬
rity. Could not the General Assembly
set up an Arms Monitoring Board to
collate and publicize all the information
available from such bodies as SIPRI
(Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute) and the various national and
University Institutes of Strategic Studies
on actions which disturb the strategic
balance and give a new thrust to the
spiral of the arms race?
Second, the arms trade in weapons.
Most industrialized countries have got
themselves into a situation where many
of their biggest firms depend for viabi¬
lity and much of their labour force de-
OPEN LETTER FROM 50 SCHOOLCHILDREN
The text reproduced here in facsimile is an open letter presented to
Mr. Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General of Unesco, by children of
the primary school at Etterbeek near Brussels (Belgium) when Mr. M'Bow
visited the school in November 1975.

"50 CHILDREN... ARE DETERMINED.
TO FOLLOW WORLD EVENTS... AND
WANT TO STAY OPTIMISTIC
Brussels 1975
Whether you are left-wing . or right-
wing, whether you are believers or
atheists, Europeans, Africans or Asians-
members of one community or another,
civilians or military, whether you are
supporters or opponents of . . .
Whoever you may be. . . please tell
us. . .
. . .why there are so many wars, con¬
flicts, wrongs
. . .why the noblest ideals are so often
contested, suppressed or misused
. . .why you teach us splendid ideas
which you yourselves then fail to
follow.
Tell us the name of the person who
won't dismiss our letter with a shrug of
the shoulders. . . and he or she will be
our friend.
A group of 12-year-old children"
pends for employment, on arms sales.
And many non-industrialized countries
are avid buyers because of local inter¬
national tensions, or because of do¬
mestic insecurity or a need for prestige.
A U.N. Arms Monitoring Board would
help here too by objectively exposing
the facts of the traffic. But a far greater
contribution would be for the General
Assembly to negotiate a general accep¬
tance that the new international econo¬
mic order must include provision for
progressive steps in the registering,
control and reduction of arms sales if
it is to make sense at all.
Third, the sale of nuclear reactors
which produce near-weapons-grade
wastes is breaking down such safe¬
guards as were obtained by the Non-
Proliferation Treaty, so that we feel our¬
selves returning to a situation like that
of the 1930s when any nation deciding
to go beserk could do so, but this time
armed with the bomb:
The one difference now is that the
General Assembly has recently moved
towards a single vision of interdepen¬
dence and has had significant successes
In harmonizing the will of member states,
whereas in the 1930s the Assembly of
the League of Nations was falling into
disarray. It is to the General Assembly,
therefore, that we must look again, this
time to negotiate at an early date the
acceptance by all states of control of
all nuclear wastes by the International
Atomic Energy Agency.
I cannot believe that the U.N. Gener¬
al Assembly, which showed such indus¬
try, patience, skill and determination to
arrive at a consensus on a new interna¬
tional order for the world, will now fail
to protect that emerging order from
self-destruction. There is no one else
to do so.

NEW STATUS FOR WOMEN
Sir,
On the occasion of International
Women's Year 1975, it is understand¬
able that the "Unesco Courier" should
have given much space to this theme
and possible consequences of accord¬
ing a new status to women. But since
you had dealt adequately with the
subject in your March 1975 issue, I was
disappointed to find the entire August-
September number also devoted to this
question.
It is not that I lack interest in the
problems of women's status throughout
the world. But in my view the whole
presentation of International Women's
Year has been too much like a
publicity campaign. What good it will
do and who will benefit from it is
difficult to say. Most women who have
been questioned about the impact of
International Women's Year say that
their lives are no different now from
what they were in 1974. Consideration
of women's status must inevitably
involve that of men too. So why not
look at the human condition as a
whole?

ACCIDENTS AT WORK
Sir,
By 1974 the number of serious
accidents at work had risen to a world
figure over 1,700,000 yearly. What steps
have been taken at the international
level to prevent accidents at work?
In view of the alarming world figures,
would it not be worthwhile to consider
devoting some space to the subject of
preventing accidents at work?
