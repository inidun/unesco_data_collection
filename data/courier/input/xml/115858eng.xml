Text by Nedim Gürsel**

I s t a n bul is present in most of my books.
One of my novels begins with these
wo r d s :“ For a long time I rose early. I t
was there, on the Asian shores of the Bos-
phorus, in my beloved city, which has fol-
lowed me everywhere and whose memory
is branded in my mind forever.”What new
can I find to say about Istanbu l , as a Tu r k i s h
w riter who has lived in Pa ris for twe n t y - five
years, except by evoking the piercing nos-
talgia I feel for the city from afar. My fore-
head bent over white pages, I imagine the
city and invent it through writing.
Slowly it comes into focus in the lam-
plight.Its famous skyline of slender mina-
r e t s , lead domes, castle keeps, r a m p a rt s ,
t owe rs and office buildings slowly emerges.
I see the peeling walls and the pigeons. I feel
the cool air of a café near the courtyard of
a mosque. I picture myself in a taxi. The
d e e p, dark blue wat e rs of the Bosphorus are
flowing just alongside.As the road narr ow s ,
the trees become more abundant. Cruise
ships as big as cities speed past pursued by
seagulls, leaving foamy whirlpools in their
wa k e . Long row b o ats and cormorants fend
the dazzlingly white foam as they glide
through the wat e r. Wooden houses and
*Selim Günes, who was born in Turkey in 1961,
is a widely-travelled photographer whose work was
shown at the “Istanbul-Istanbul”exhibition at the
city’s Taksim gallery in November 1998.
** Nedim Gürsel is a Turkish author who writes 
in Turkish and French.He was born in 1951 and has
published some twenty novels, short stories,
travelogues and essays that have been translated into
ten or so languages. Notable among his works are “A
Long Summer in Istanbul”,
“The Death of the Seagull”and an anthology of
Turkish women’s literature entitled Paroles dévoilées
(Arcantère-UNESCO Publishing,1993).His novel “The
First Woman”won the Ipekçi Prize, awarded by a
Greek-Turkish foundation,
for its contribution to understanding between 
the two peoples. Gürsel has also written 
the screenplay for a motion picture which is currently
being filmed and will probably 
be called Istanbul My Love.

most unexpected moment, t u rning a corn e r

I know that it is here, in one of these dilapi-
d ated tombs, t h at one day I shall be laid to

thank God. So I picture myself on Karaköy

A hand
outstretched 
to Europe
6 The UNESCO Courier - May 1999
P E O P L E  A N D  P L A C E S
Located on the European shore of the Bos-
phorus Straits, Istanbul is at the crossroads
of land and sea routes, Asia and Europe, the
Black Sea and the Mediterranean.It is Turkey’s
main manufacturing centre, commercial hub
and port.With a population of 12 million, the city
and its surrounding suburbs are the country’s
fastest-growing urban area.
Founded by the Greeks as Byzantium
around 658 B. C . , Istanbul became the capital of
the Eastern Roman Empire in 330 A.D. under
Emperor Constantine, whose name it bore until
the fall of the Byzantine Empire. C o n s t a n t i n o p l e
was taken by the Crusaders in 1204, r e c o n-
quered by the Greeks in 1261 and captured by
the Ottomans on May 29, 1 4 5 3 . Mehmed II,
the Conqueror, made it the capital of the
Ottoman Empire in 1458,changing the name to
I s t a n b u l . It was not until 1923 that the city lost
its status as capital to A n k a r a . The famous
bridge spanning the Bosphorus was inaugu-
rated in March 1973.
“An old,ring-covered hand stretching out
towards Europe”is how the French poet Jean
Cocteau described Istanbul, whose historic
a r e a s, where many Byzantine and Ottoman
landmarks stand side-by-side, were added to
UN E S C O’s World Heritage List in 1985.The famous
Hagia Sophia church,built between 532 and 537
by order of Emperor Justinian II; the Mosque of
Süleyman,named after Süleyman the Magnifi-
cent and inaugurated in 1556; the Blue Mosque,
Topkapi palace and the great bazaar bear wit-
ness to a history spanning well over a thousand
years. n

swe at and uri n e . I look away from Karaköy
Square, turning my gaze left to the other
bank of the Golden Horn . Suddenly the
spectacle changes. The stage seems to
w i d e n . I see clouds briskly scudding past in
the southern wind. Straight ahead, B aye z i t
Tower gradually gr ows fainter in the ashen
light. In the distance, I can make out the
spiky minarets of the Mosque of Süleyman,
its heavy domes overwhelming the old
h o u s e s , and stacked crates forming a wall in
front of the covered market.The pigeons of
the New Mosque—little black spots—stand
out against the sky. Taking off from the
m o s q u e ’s court ya r d , they land on the blac-
kened walls and canopies of the Egyptian
b a z a a r. O d d l y, the opposite bank seems
more peaceful. But the fish market makes a
deafening racket. In the shimmeri n g
colours, fishing boats moored at the quay
bob up and down on the filthy water.The
Golden Horn is strewn with shreds of oily
rags and dead seagulls.
A tide of passengers pours out of the
Eyüp ferry which has drawn up alongside
G a l ata Bri d g e .Thick smoke belches out of
the funnel. Soot rains down on bunches of
grapes and polished apples in the stalls, o n
the old civil servants sitting in the bridge’s
c a f é s , smoking hookahs as they finger their
p r ayer beads. Police motorboat s , t a rt a n s
and pot-bellied barges glide past. So does
the boat owned by the fisherman who sells
his catch near the landing pier.The seve r e d
fish heads make me feel sick. So I get up and
head for a quieter neighbourhood.
Back in the streets, strolling past wo o d e n
houses with iron gat e s , I feel I am living
through a dream.As if I am outside the city
in an unknow n , inaccessible place, facing a
t h e atre set beyond which it is impossible to
g o. Sometimes cars pass by, and street pedd-
l e rs. “Rags! Second-hand goods!,” s h o u t s
one of them.Another yells that he sells wat e r-
melons or, d r a g ging out the “ o ” ,s ays “ t o o-
m at o e s ” instead of “ t o m at o e s ” . And “ Pe p-
p e rs! Eggplant! Chicory! Lettuce! Okra!”
They are the cries of another age, of an
I s t a n bul I have never forgotten.They come
from an unreal wo r l d . A world I can no
longer reach even if I go there.Ye s , I am in
Pa ris and, like the gr e at Turkish poet Orhan
Ve l i , who died there at the age of 35, “ I
listen to Istanbul with my eyes closed.”A n d
the lines of another Istanbul poet, w h o s e
name still bu rns my lips and who endured
more than his share of separations and nos-
t a l gic longi n g s , come to mind:“ Two things
are forgotten only in death / The face of our
mother and the face of our city.” n

Science reigns tri u m p h a n t . N e ver has it been so powerful and influ e n t i a l . It has
conquered diseases which have decimated whole populat i o n s. It has abolished exhaus-
ting physical labour and wearisome repetitive tasks. It has vanquished distance and
pushed back the frontiers of our knowledge of the infinitely large and the infinitely small,
in both the inanimate and the living world.
In short, it has acquired the ability to shape our lives, to change life itself. But it has
also increased its capacity to destroy life.The strength of an army can rest on the number
and determ i n ation of its combatants but it is also, and chiefly, based on the technologi c a l
sophistication of their weaponry.The bombing of Iraq,and now of Serbia, are the latest
examples.
Yet science is wave ri n g . For the first time since the Enlightenment, the way science can
be used is being challenged.The link between scientific progress and social progress is we a-
kening and signs of obscurantism are appeari n g . Hiroshima sounded the alarm .Then the
c risis of the env i r o n m e n t ,t riggered by the dominant mode of deve l o p m e n t ,t u rned ques-
tioning of science into a worldwide issue.This form of development is inseparable from
a frantic and indiscriminate quest for technological innovation.Finally, advances in bio-
technology, which harbour many grave dangers for human dignity, are often too closely
bound up with the selfish interests of their promoters.
No one blames science for not knowing eve ry t h i n g . No one criticizes it because it has
not yet found a vaccine against AIDS or reached a conclusion about the theory of the Big
B a n g . It has never been claimed of science, as it has of history, t h at it has come to an end.
It must keep on tirelessly probing the enduring mysteries of life.
But science can no longer avoid—and nor can we—the basic question of what and who
it is for. In other wo r d s , are the we l fare and interests of the public being served by the pri o-
rities of researchers , the thrust of their wo r k , the ways in which they are organized, the fun-
ding they receive , and the circulation of their findings? Or are scientists looking mainly in
the direction of high-spending consumers at the expense of long-term basic research?
Because of the gr owing “ p ri vat i z at i o n ” of research, are we not tending to overlook essen-
tial and universal human needs which cannot immediately be met?
Those who are excluded from this new “ s c i e n t i fic powe r ” must make their voices heard.
For example, the inhabitants of the 600,000 villages which have no electricity or the wo r l d ’s
two billion people without access to drinking water have the right to ask science to find
solutions adapted to their ve ry meagre resources. Humanity also has the right to ask science
to gi ve pri o rity to research into processes of global disruption and ways of coping with them.
W h at ’s more, all citizens have the right to ask science to further our understanding of the
mechanisms of inequality and exclusion which are gradually undermining peace and demo-
cracy.
To move towards such a new contract between science and society, UNESCO and the
I n t e rn ational Council for Science (IC S U) are inviting scientists, p ri vate firm s ,g ove rn m e n t s
and other stakeholders to attend a conference which will be held in Budapest at the end
of June. One major purpose of this meeting will be to see that the benefits of science go
p ri m a rily to all those who have hitherto been unreached. Their conditions will only
improve if they have access to the mighty power of science. n

Who owns Antarctica?
The Antarctic is unique in that it is
owned by no one country and has been
governed for almost 40 years by an inter-
national treaty (see box).Because of this it
cannot be controlled or policed as areas of
n ational sovereignty can.To make changes
in the rules, the 27 Antarctic Treaty (AT)
countries all have to agree.
Do people need to get a visa to go there?
If you are a citizen of an AT country, t h e n
these days you have to get a permit to meet the
requirements of the environmental protocol.
Since these countries represent 70 per cent of
the wo r l d ’s populat i o n , there is a strong pre-
sumption that most people who will be going
to the Antarctic will be getting perm i t s. I f
they are touri s t s ,t r avel agents will get a perm i t
for them.C o u n t ries which are not party to the
t r e aty do not have to provide perm i t s.
A n t a r c t i c a ’s t a i n t e d
horizons 
The A n t a rctic was designated ‘a continent for peace and
science’ in an international treaty signed 38 years ago. In the
last decade a wide-ranging Protocol has been added to this to
p rovide the continent with better environmental pro t e c t i o n .
But today dark shadows of pollution are looming over this
remote continent with a unique international status. On the
eve of a meeting of A n t a rctic Treaty nations to be held in May
1999 in Lima, Pe r u , D r. David Walton of the British A n t a rc t i c
Survey explains why conservation of what is still ‘the world’s
cleanest place’ is important for all of us.

P L A N E T
Is there much tourism?
To u rists attracted by the continent’s
remoteness, wildlife and stunning scenery
first came by ship in the 1960s,and in the
past two decades their numbers have
climbed steadily.Air tourism has also deve-
loped over the past decade. Last year there
were over 10,000 tourists in Antarctica—
more people than were concerned with all
the scientific stations and their logistic sup-
p o rt . Some 60 or so sites are regularly used
for tourist visits.
Do tourists bring pollution?
M a ny tourists are already well inform e d
about environmental issues and know that
uncontrolled tourism can damage the fea-
tures that make the area special. As ye t
there is no unequivocal scientific evidence
of damage but there must be a limit to the
number of visitors that sites can sustain
before the vegetation or wildlife are tram-
pled out of existence.
How can numbers be controlled?
There appears to be no legal way at
present to do this for visitors to an inter-
n ational area. G ove rnments can help
manage tourism by limiting permits to com-
panies with good environmental records,bu t
my view is that the tour companies them-
s e l ves must accept the responsibility to limit
impacts by policing their customers.
Worryingly, the passenger capacity of
c ruise ships is ri s i n g, with ships carrying up
to 1,700 passengers proposing to transit
the Antarctic whilst others intend to land up
to 800 passengers at individual sites. My
p e rsonal experience of tour ships has so
far been good, with guides working hard to
inform passengers as well as keep them to
a strict environmental code whilst on shore.
They do not leave litter, the ships do not
deposit waste overboard in Antarctic wat e rs
and for the most part visitors do not appear
to seriously disturb wildlife.
Why is it so important to preserve the
Antarctic environment?
The Antarctic is special because it has
less pollution than anywhere else in the
world—it doesn’t have any smokestack
industry, agricultural activity or perma-
nent human population. We can use it as
the baseline against which pollution levels
in other parts of the world can be measu-
red, to tell us whether or not the situation
is getting worse. From this point of view,
the Antarctic will only remain scientifical-
ly valuable if it is properly managed today.
Sampling snow cores in Antarctica has
gi ven us a range of pollution ya r d s t i c k s.We
can see in the snow the increasing levels of
lead we have been putting into the atmos-
phere since the Industrial Revo l u t i o n ,w i t h
the most rapid increase when lead wa s
added to fuel for cars. The snow also
contains a signature of the worldwide pol-
lution caused by the atomic bomb tests of
the 1950s and 1960s. Most recently we
h ave been able to detect carbon part i c l e s
in the air produced by forest fires in the tro-
pics.
What can be done to combat these
environmental threats?
You have to distinguish between glo-
bal and local threats. Let’s look at the
local problems first. Until the mid-1950s
there was very little scientific activity in
the Antarctic and the only industry in the
area was whaling. At that time the oceans
were seen as suitable repositories for
waste, and dumping waste in uninhabited
areas was acceptable. When I first began
work in the Antarctic in 1967, recycling
was not even considered in many research
stations and dumping waste in remote
areas of the Antarctic was a common
practice.Unfortunately, in the low tempe-
r atures characteristic of the A n t a r c t i c,
there is virtually no bacterial decay, so the
wastes associated with scientific stations
and with this laissez-faire attitude of ear-
lier days are still with us. In fact it was this
problem of waste disposal that raised the
alarm among AT countries and led to the
signature in 1991 of the Protocol for the
Protection of the Antarctic Environment.
This protocol,which came into legal force
in January 1998 but had been followed by
most countries since 1991, introduced
rigorous environmental regulations and
forced countries to clean up the mess they
had created.
Is the protocol working?
The rules comprise the most stri n g e n t
c o n s e rvation and management rules so fa r
agreed upon anywhere in the world.They
c over all human activities in A n t a r c t i c a ,
and include stipulations for rigorous control
of waste disposal and contingency plans to
combat marine pollution and protect flora
and fauna. No mining or exploration for
minerals or hydrocarbons will be allowed in
the Antarctic for the next 50 ye a rs.The AT
nations have taken their role as managers
ve ry seriously and made enormous amounts
of investment in changes of practice. I t
costs a lot of money to be environmentally
c l e a n . When the U. S . a greed to the pro-
tocol they immediately produced $30 mil-
lion for clean-up operations around the
American scientific stations.
In other words, the Antarctic Treaty and the
Protocol to prevent pollution are
functioning well within the Antarctic itself
but pollution is coming in from outside.

P L A N E T
T h at ’s ri g h t . Most of the Antarctic pol-
lutants come from industrial and agri c u l-
tural activity in the nort h e rn hemisphere.
We can measure them in the air, the snow
and in the plants and animals. Fo r
e x a m p l e , there is one especially unpleasant
group of chemicals called persistent orga-
nic pollutants (POPs) which compri s e s
i n s e c t i c i d e s , herbicides and other env i r o n-
mentally damaging substances. T h e s e
compounds do not exist nat u r a l l y, b r e a k
d own only ve ry slowly in marine and ter-
r e s t rial ecosystems and accumulate with
t oxic effects. None of them are made or
used in the Antarctic and they are now
banned from use both there and in many
other parts of the wo r l d .They mainly ori-
gi n ate from the nort h e rn hemisphere, p r o-
duced by agri c u l t u r e , i n d u s t rial processes
and from waste breakdow n . M e a s u ri n g
their presence in Antarctic penguins and
seals indicates the baseline pollution leve l
for these compounds throughout the
wo r l d . The increasing range and concen-
t r ation of many POPs in Antarctica is a
s o b e ring reminder of how far these dama-
ging compounds can spread outside our
control and how little we can do about it.
Industrial countries of the North contribute
up to 80 per cent of the greenhouse gas
emissions that cause global warming and
endanger fragile areas like the A n t a rc t i c. Ye t
these countries are also parties to the
e n v i ronmental protocol to preserve the
A n t a rctic enviro n m e n t . Isn’t there a
c o n t radiction here ?
T h at is quite corr e c t . It is surp ri s i n g, t o
say the least, that states which have shown
e x t r a o r d i n a ry co-operation in preserv i n g
the Antarctic environment are not doing
enough to control the pollution in their
own parts of the world.
The Antarctic Tr e aty is a bit like the Inter-
n ational Law of the Sea, where eve ry b o d y
a grees on what should happen on the high
seas and then does something different in
their own wat e rs.There seems to be a contrast
b e t ween what countries can do co-operat i ve l y
in an area that is not owned by them and is
not being industrially developed by them
and has no indigenous populat i o n ,and what
they do in their own terri t o ry where there is
a populat i o n ,i n d u s t ry and expectations for a
different way of life.
What can be done?
Nothing can be done to prevent this
long-range pollution in the Antarctic which
is due to industrial activities in other parts
of the wo r l d . Antarctic pollution will
continue as long as pollution continues
elsewhere in the world.What we can do is
to attempt to keep our own Antarctic house
in order by ensuring that the activities that
take place down there are first of all subject
to environmental impact assessment and
then that we use technologies and metho-
d o l o gies that minimize damage or pollution.
Would you say that environmental
protection is easier in the Antarctic than in
the Arctic?
One major reason why the AT nat i o n s
h ave been able to introduce such stri n g e n t
e nvironmental regulations is that there is no
indigenous population seeking to fulfil its
a s p i r ations at the cost of the env i r o n m e n t .I n
the Arctic region on the other hand, w h e r e
there is a sizeable population and countri e s
h ave sovereign terri t o ry, there are ve ry consi-
derable areas of mineral development and
hydrocarbon and gas extraction. In Siberi a ,
for example, there are enormous oil spills
from fractured pipelines and heavy metal
pollution problems from smelters that simply
do not occur in the A n t a r c t i c.
Who is liable for environmental damage in
the Antarctic? Environmentalists say the
Treaty is not clear about this.
T h at is tru e . No agreement has been rea-
ched as ye t .This question is on the agenda for
the treaty meeting in Lima in May.
Why do countries not agree about this?
There are a number of difficult pro-
blems. First of all you have to get 27 coun-
t ries with 27 different legal systems and 27
different cultural expectations to agree on
what liability means.
Ta k e , for example, the idea of a protected
area in a national park. In the U. S . , a nat i o n a l
park is a protected area owned by the Fe d e r a l
g ove rnment and is run as a park for conser-
vation purp o s e s.A national park in the UK is
not owned by the gove rnment but by lots of
s e p a r ate land-ow n e rs. It isn’t run mainly for
c o n s e rvation purp o s e s. It contains industry,
housing and all sorts of other activities. I t
d o e s n ’t bear any resemblance what s o e ver to
the A m e ri c a n ,G e rman and French ve rs i o n s.
The same term in law means lots of different
A continent for p e a c e and s c i e n c e
Internationally co-ordinated work in the A n t a r c t i c
began with the scientific initiative called the
International Geophysical Year in 1957.The results
were so impressive,both scientifically and politically,
that in 1959 the participating countries signed the
Antarctic Treaty (AT ) , which came into force in
1 9 6 1 . The Tr e a t y, which runs indefinitely, d e s i-
gnates the continent as an area for peace and
s c i e n c e, freezes all territorial claims, forbids military
activity and nuclear waste disposal,and encourages
international collaboration in science and logistics.
The Treaty was initially signed by A r g e n t i n a ,A u s-
t r a l i a , C h i l e, Fr a n c e, New Zealand, N o r wa y, t h e
United Kingdom, B e l g i u m , Ja p a n , South A f r i c a ,t h e
former Soviet Union and the United States. S i n c e
1961 a wide variety of extra legislation has been
agreed at the regular meetings of the AT nations,
who now comprise 27 countries with active scien-
t i fic programmes covering areas of science ranging
from the outer atmosphere to the rocks beneath the
ice sheet, from the bacteria in ice cores to the
origin of the Southern Hemisphere continents.
Many of the projects are now so large (e. g . ,e s t i-
mating whether the whole ice sheet is growing or
melting) that they can only be accomplished by big
international teams working over several years.A
further 16 countries have acceded to the Treaty but
do not undertake research.AT countries represent
around 70 per cent of the world’s population.
In 1991,the AT nations signed the Environ-
mental Protocol to the Antarctic Tr e a t y, w h i c h
bans mining for 50 years and provides for a fully
comprehensive regime of environmental protec-
tion. n

things in different countri e s.T h at is one of the
major problems we face in the case of liability.
Do any states parties to the Antarctic Treaty
still have territorial claims over the
Antarctic?
The Antarctic treaty freezes all territo-
rial claims that were there in 1961 and
these cannot be improved on or added to in
any way.Taking away this major source of
i n t e rn ational disagreement has allowed the
parties to continually adjust the treaty to
meet changing public and political needs
over the past 38 ye a rs. Of particular impor-
tance throughout that period has been the
scientific advice on the best methods for
management that has been supplied by the
i n t e rn ational science community. T h at
makes the AT a slightly unusual treaty. By
including scientists right from the start it has
been able to tap into the scientific com-
munity and get sound scientific advice.
What kind of scientific research is being
done in the Antarctic?
The special environmental characteri s t i c s
of the continent make it possible to carry out
scientific inve s t i g ations and experi m e n t s
which are not possible anywhere else in the
wo r l d .We are looking at animals and plants
t h at can surv i ve in the ve ry low tempera-
tures and ve ry dry atmosphere which are
c h a r a c t e ristic of the A n t a r c t i c.We are using
the Antarctic as an experimental area to test
out theories about whether life can surv i ve on
M a rs. And we are managing one of the lar-
gest fis h e ries in the southern hemisphere.
Because of the characteristics of the ear-
t h ’s magnetic fie l d , the Antarctic has some
unique features enabling us to inve s t i g at e
the causes of solar storm s.These occur when
a solar flare on the sun produces a storm of
charged particles which hurtle towards the
e a rth and affect its upper at m o s p h e r e ,w h e r e
hundreds of communicat i o n s ,n av i g at i o n a l
and television satellites have been positioned.
In the Antarctic we are working on measuri n g
solar storms and developing a model which
will wa rn us about their likely effects so that
we can protect satellites by moving them to
a safer orbit or by switching them off.
Damage can affect a lot of people.
For instance, a solar storm produced a
tremendous amount of induced current in a
p ower system in North A m e rica a few ye a rs
ago causing the whole of Quebec’s electri c a l
system to collapse. If we can develop a model
which tells us what the strength of the storm
will be and when it will strike and so on we
can take precautions to stop that sort of
thing happening. In addition to measuri n g
pollution leve l s , research is also being carri e d
out into many aspects of global wa rm i n g,
melting ice sheets and rising sea leve l s.
There have been reports that ice shelves
in the Antarctic are disintegrating and
drifting away. Is this so?
We know that some of the smaller flo at i n g
ice shelves on the Antarctic peninsula have
d i s i n t e gr ated over the last 40 ye a rs. T h e y
d o n ’t make any difference to the sea leve l
because they were already flo ating but they
do show that significant regional wa rming is
o c c u rring in this area. W h at we still don’t
k n ow yet is whether the total ice sheet is in
b a l a n c e .We are developing a model but it will
take many more ye a rs yet before we can be
c e rtain if and when the ice sheets could melt.
What is the present situation of ozone
depletion above the Antarctic?
It was the discove ry of the hole in the
ozone layer over the Antarctic in 1985 by the
B ritish Antarctic Survey that drew at t e n t i o n
to the depletion by industrial processes,
notably chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases,
of the ozone layer that stops harmful solar
r a d i ation from penetrating through to the ear-
t h ’s surfa c e .Last spring saw the lowest ozone
l e vel in the Antarctic ever recorded.
We will not see the ozone level climb
back up to normal protective levels until we
h ave got rid of all the chemicals which are
causing ozone destruction in the upper
at m o s p h e r e . Since CFCs are still around it
is unlikely that there is going to be a sudden
r e c ove ry of the ozone layer in the next few
d e c a d e s.As of now there is a black market in
CFCs to get round the restrictions on trading
and manufa c t u r e .
There are so many CFCs around—in
deep freeze and air conditioning plants—
t h at it is not going to be possible to get rid of
them quickly.We are going to be faced with
ozone depletion for a considerable time.
Depletion is already happening in the A r c t i c,
and ozone levels above Europe have declined
in the past few ye a rs. It is happening all ove r
the wo r l d .The most frightening thing is just
h ow difficult it is to gain any real control
over such serious global damage to conserve
the world for future generat i o n s. n

Antarctica and its ice shelves cover about 14
million square kilometres, 10 per cent of the
e a r t h ’s land area. Less than 1% is free of per-
manent ice and snow.The highest continent (esti-
mated average altitude 2,300 m), it is perpe-
tually hidden beneath the planet’s largest ice
c a p, built up over 400,000 years of compacted
snow fall and now almost 5 km deep in places.
The ice cap contains over 32 million km3 of ice
(about 90% of the world’s ice and almost 70% of
its fresh wa t e r ) , but with an average precipitation
of only 5 cm per year, Antarctica is the driest
place on earth.
Antarctica is also the world’s coldest place
(annual mean temperature -160C ) . The coldest
temperature ever recorded on earth was -89.60C
at Russia’s Vostok research station in July 1983.
Strong winds, sometimes up to 320 km per hour,
blow throughout the year.Recorded annual mean
wind speed average is about 67 km per hour,
making it the planet’s windiest place. n

Schools  F rom pollution to over- p o p u l a t i o n , education has 
a key role to play in helping learners realize early on
how they can influence the future—for the better
n
Gone are the days when env i r o n m e n t a l
e d u c ation was simply about nat u r e
outings in pri m a ry school to discover the
local flora and fa u n a , or projects to unders-
tand a regi o n ’s landscapes, economic activi-
ties and traditions.To d ay,the accent is on no
less than giving students the right set of tools
and values to become eco-citizens—respon-
sible consumers , p r o d u c e rs and decision-
m a k e rs , able to  measure the implications of
their actions, not only on their own surr o u n-
d i n g s , but at a more global leve l .
In an environmentally literate society,
e c o n o m i s t s , for example, will have a basic
u n d e rstanding of what a balanced ecosystem
is while biologists will be in a position to
grasp such notions as economic effic i e n cy.
“Just as with literacy, it is through educat i o n
t h at we can train citizens to integr ate env i-
ronmental dimensions into their decision-
making processes,”argues Canadian biologi s t
and author Claude V i l l e n e u ve1. “The objec-
t i ve is to change behaviour in order to dimi-
nish the impact of human activity on the
b i o s p h e r e .As such, it is an education geared
t owards action.An ecologically literate pers o n
should be able to understand and act in spe-
c i fic ways in his or her daily life.”
The new 3Rs–
Reduce, Reuse,Recycle
At the community college where he
teaches in Quebec, V i l l e n e u ve and his col-
leagues put this credo into practice throu-
ghout the science fa c u l t y. Whether in bio-
l o g y, c h e m i s t ry or physics experi m e n t s ,
students are asked to show systemat i c a l l y
t h at they have chosen the least dangerous
option for the env i r o n m e n t ,b y, for example,
minimizing waste or foreseeing special recy-
cling containers. In studying a physical phe-
nomenon like the meanders left by water on
an inclined plain, students will observe what
happens when those naturally traced by ri ve rs
are tampered with, leading to erosion, d e f o-
r e s t ation and a rise in water leve l s.“The aim
is to make students aware of sound env i r o n-
mental practices at the end of their studies by
setting down objectives that are common to
all disciplines,” explains V i l l e n e u ve .
With their often centralized and ri gi d
s t ru c t u r e s , e d u c ation systems appear ill-
equipped to break down the wat e rtight wa l l s
b e t ween disciplines and integr ate env i r o n-
mental concerns across the board. Ye t , t h e
process towards a more holistic approach is
u n d e r way at all leve l s ,s p u rred by the present
c risis and an emergi n g,more interdependent
vision of the future.
From the 1972 United Nations Confe-
rence on Human Environment in Stockholm
to the highly publicized 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio, d e velopment and environment have
gone from being radically opposed to each
other to standing on parallel tracks.The rea-
lities of population gr ow t h , depleting nat u r a l
r e s o u r c e s , rising pollution and widening dis-
p a rities between North and South—to men-
tion just a few causes for gr ave concern —
tell us that the present course is untenable for
both human beings and the biosphere itself.

  for e c o- c i t i z e n s Cynthia Guttman*
the notion of “sustainable deve l o p m e n t ” .
Although it has been interpreted in more
than one way, the most commonly held defi-
nition was put forward in 1987 by the Wo r l d
Commission on Environment and Deve l o p-
m e n t , presided by Gro Harlem Bru n d t l a n d ,
as “ d e velopment that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs.”
In working towards this endeavo u r , t h e
p i votal role of education has been stressed
time and time again on the intern at i o n a l
s t a g e , from the 1990 conference in Jomtien on
E d u c ation for A l l , to other world gat h e ri n g s
on populat i o n , wo m e n , social deve l o p m e n t
and cities. The transform at i ve potential of
e d u c ation is often highlighted by the simple
fact that educated mothers are more likely to
adopt desirable health and nutritional prac-
t i c e s ,h ave fewer children and send their ow n
d a u g h t e rs to school.
In educating for sustainable deve l o p-
m e n t , the connections between people,
r e s o u r c e s , health and quality of life are
e m p h a s i z e d . “The objective is to deve l o p
responsible behav i o u r , to be able to make the
p e rtinent and right decisions, and act res-
ponsibly at an individual and collective leve l
t owards env i r o n m e n t a l ,p o p u l ation and deve-
lopment issues,” s ays Nathalie Barboza from
UN E S C O’s office in Dakar (Senegal).O ver the
past decade, a majority of countries in the
South have integr ated these concerns into
f o rmal and non-formal curri c u l a .
The motto of the environmental move-
ment—“act local, think global”—has lost
none of its hold.“ C o u n t ries generally find the
contents of programmes in the local reality,”
explains Barboza.“A teacher will, for example,
s t a rt off the geogr a p hy lesson by showing his
or her students a field of scorched eart h ,a n d
from there, discuss resource management
and the consequences of deforestat i o n .M o s t
t e a c h e rs feel directly concerned by these
questions and are aware that the key thing is
to develop responsible attitudes to preserve the
e nv i r o n m e n t .”R e flecting the interdependent
n ature of issues, the ministries of health,
yo u t h , social affa i rs and the environment are
often invited to work in tandem with educa-
tion authori t i e s.
In revising curri c u l a , disciplines often
take on a much more pertinent beat . I n
M e x i c o, for example, the recently revised
n atural science curriculum for pri m a ry schools
broaches topics such as the importance of
water for life, types of pollution and their
s o u r c e s , p o p u l ation gr ow t h , i n d u s t ri a l i z e d
and natural foods and how technologies affect
e c o s y s t e m s.The intention is to help children
view the environment as a “common good,
which requires different consumption pat-
t e rns for progress to be compatible with the
use of natural resources,” s t ates Edgar Gon-
z a l e z - G a u d i a n o, from Mexico’s Ministry of
the Env i r o n m e n t . “As of third gr a d e , t e x t-
books teach the rule of the 3Rs—Reduce,

R e u s e , R e cycle—with special emphasis on
the firs t , to show the students the import a n c e
of looking after our natural resources, i rr e s-
p e c t i ve of how ‘ a bu n d a n t ’ they may be.”
One way to encourage transdisciplinari t y
is to make teachers feel they are part i c i p at i n g
in a common educational pr o j e c t ,s t resses V i l-
l e n e u ve .The notion of density in mat h e m a-
t i c s , for example, can be just as easily
explained in terms of dots on a page as by
trees in a forest. A teacher will likely choose
the second option if he or she looks at learn i n g
through an environmental lens. Making lear-
ning such a “future and action-ori e n t e d ”
project requires, in the best of wo r l d s , the par-
t i c i p ation of the society at large.
Learning to think globally
To r o n t o, one of the wo r l d ’s most multi-
ethnic cities, is a case in point.When the Board
of Education embarked on a school reform ,t h e
process was not locked in academic circles.I n s-
t e a d , some 7,000 individuals, from parents
and staff to business leaders ,NGOs and repre-
s e n t at i ves of the arts world turned up for full-
d ay consultations on how education should be
responding to the demands of a changi n g
wo r l d .W h at ,p a rticipants were asked, s h o u l d
students know,do and value by the time they
gr a d u ate from school? Rather than a narr ow set
of goals geared towards the wo r k p l a c e ,p a rt i-
cipants stressed concepts like responsible citi-
z e n s h i p, c ritical thinking, p e rsonal life skills,
values and actions.
According to Charles Hopkins, one of the
c o - o r d i n at o rs of the project,“if you were to read
all the answe rs that came in with sustainable
d e velopment eyeglasses and highlight eve ry
reference to the env i r o n m e n t , economic and
human deve l o p m e n t , the pages would have
leapt into colour.”As the curriculum guidelines
s t at e ,“ l e a rning must help students to conduct
their lives in ways that foster healthy social
and natural systems, both locally and glo-
b a l l y.”The environment is a theme ru n n i n g
across disciplines, from social studies to the
n atural sciences.Around such key concepts as
p owe r , time and change, students ascend from
the personal and the local to the global as they
come to grips with the multi-layered dimension
of issues and draw connections between them.
But bri n ging about changes in at t i t u d e s
A summer camp with a m e s s a g e
“Down there in the village, life is hard,the-
r e ’s drought, animals are dying. Th e r e ’s
no work, the village is cut off, there’s a lack of
basic services and lots of other problems. So I
came to the city,” Modou tells his friend.But life
there does not turn out to be much better: M o d o u
doesn’t find work, and discovers the reality of
prostitution,slums and urban violence. Some six
months later, he runs into a friend from home and
finds out that villagers have formed an organi-
zation to improve their lot by taking initiatives in
a number of fie l d s, from agriculture to drilling
w e l l s. Upon hearing the news, he willingly sets off
back to his village.
Rural exodus was just one of the themes
broached in the dialogues, comic strips, poems,
short stories and games written by youth bet-
ween 12 and 25 during a summer camp held in
August 1998 in Senegal,in the coastal village of
Pa l m a r i n . Organized by UN E S C O and the NGO
Groupe pour l’Etude et l’Enseignement de la
Population (GEEP), it aimed to increase youth’s
awareness of a number of issues related to sus-
tainable development.
Participants had a set goal to work towa r d s :t h e
production of a manual that would serve as a
valuable tool for other teenagers engaged in com-
munity mobilization and awa r e n e s s - r a i s i n g .
Printed in 2,000 copies and now distributed in
Senegalese schools—notably those running pro-
grammes on environment, population and deve-
lopment (EPD), the manual1 provides a lively
approach to understanding and tackling deve-
lopment challenges.
Two units of the book are comprised of a dia-
logue followed by questions in which participants
are asked to identify and analyse EPD themes,
from the consequences of uncontrolled urbaniza-
tion or coastal erosion to early marriage.Th e n ,s o l u-
tions have to identified and explained. During the
w e e k , participants’ talents at getting messages
across was put to the test. While the mornings
were set aside for working on the manual, t h e
afternoons were devoted to field activities in
several villages. One group worked on a tree-
planting project, another painted a series of murals
on EPD themes, while a third organized meetings
with villagers to raise awareness of issues. Th e
camp also enabled youth from rural and urban
areas to work hand in hand, bridging the gap
between these two worlds,and together becoming
educators for a more viable future. n

“ W h at ’s good for science is good for humanity.”
Until the end of the Cold Wa r , few people
dared challenge this dictum originating in the
p h i l o s o p hy of the Enlightenment and gi ven gr e at e r
force after the Second World Wa r. Despite the threat
of the nuclear holocaust which it had made possible,
science was widely seen as a beneficial force. I n
both East and West, it was invested with a sacred
mission—to guarantee the security and prosperity
of nations.
In the United Stat e s , the we a l t hy leader of the
“free wo r l d ” , the idea took root after 1945 that
people should trust the state and the scientists, a n d
t h at spending on basic (and military) research should
be unlimited. It was argued that pure science wo u l d
inevitably have applications that would contri bute to
p r o gress and social we l fa r e .U n i ve rsities and major
sources of funding, such as the National Science
Fo u n d ation and the va rious branches of the arm e d
f o r c e s , were left to decide on research pri o ri t i e s.

For many years, the political leaders and scientists of the
g reat powers called the shots in science. “Leave it to
u s,” they said to citizens. “ We ’ re working on your behalf,
for your security and your pro s p e r i t y.”
This tacit contract between science and society has
had its day. On the world economic battlefie l d , re s e a rc h
is increasingly geared to the market and technological
i n n o v a t i o n . The fro n t i e rs are becoming blurred between
l a b o ra t o r i e s, both public and private, and corpora t e
m a r keting services. In a situation in which science is
i n c reasingly re g a rded as a commercial re s o u rc e, how can
it yield benefits for all?

In France, people were also expected to trust the
a u t h o ri t i e s , which opted for a more diri gi s t e
a p p r o a c h .The state decided policy and chose stra-
tegic areas, and then administered and funded on
an ad hoc basis executing agencies such as the
N ational Centre for Scientific Research and the
Atomic Energy Commission.
These two models, which had the advantage
of leaving scientists with a degree of independen-
ce, were widely followed elsewhere in the world.
They boosted basic research, which produces
new knowledge with a wide range of applications.
But they also served to rubber-stamp massive
public spending for military and civil purposes.
And in this tacit agreement between scientists
and society there was a geographic and democra-
tic deficit, in the sense that science developed lar-
gely in a few urban centres as part of a national
f r a m e wo r k , and ordinary citizens were neve r
consulted. The direction of research was largely
decided by political and scientific elites and the
“ m i l i t a ry - i n d u s t rial complexe s ” of a few big
powers.
But the last 20 years have seen major changes
in the world of research. The state has lost its
capacity for initiative. Belief in progress is giving
rise to doubts and controversies. The prestige of
science,like that of state technocracies, has faded.
Its main preoccupations increasingly take
account of  private-sector interests, which these
days fund and carry out two-thirds of all research
in some industrialized countries.
This new situation has several causes. In the
1 9 7 0 s , the benefits of science and technology began
to be challenged, mainly by the env i r o n m e n t a l
movement and in the developing world. After the
Cold War ended, the strategic interests which had
accounted for huge gove rnment expenditures
changed and military spending dropped sharply.
G l o s s a r y
Applied re s e a rc h . Research aimed at developing practical
applications to basic research.
Basic re s e a rc h . Experimental or theoretical investigation
u n d e r t a ken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the
underlying foundations of phenomena and observa b l e
facts, without any particular application or use in view.
I n n o v a t i o n . The introduction of a new technique, p r o-
duct or production process. I n n o vation can take two forms.
The first, referred to as incremental innovation, aims to
improve a product or launch a new one by making slight
a d a p t a t i o n s. The second, more radical and much rarer,
enables the development of a new sector, like biotechno-
logies.

for a limited period of time.
R & D. Research work carried out by a company or group to
conceive and develop new products.
Te c h n o l o g y. The practice of any or all of the applied
sciences which have practical value and/or industrial use.
The employment of tools, m a c h i n e s, materials and pro-
cesses to do work, produce goods, perform services or
carry out other useful activities.
Transfer of technology. Process of transmitting and
adapting technology to a different productive apparatus,
generally through its export from a developed to a less-
developed country.
Venture capital. Companies that finance innovations by
taking a stake in firms that don’t have enough capital or suf-
ficient guarantees to obtain long- term loans for such
e n d e a v o u r s. Such capital is lost if the enterprise goes ban-
krupt.

Then the United States noticed with alarm that
Japan,where research was dominated by industry,
was scoring in advanced sectors such as inform at i o n
technology, electronics and new materials. As eco-
nomic interests came to the fore, the idea that bu s i-
ness was much more effective in ensuring people’s
we l fare than the political and scientific establishment
became widespread. In this struggle for competiti-
v i t y, science lost its supremacy to technologi c a l
“innovation”(pages 20-24).The main goal was to
come up with new products and innovatory pro-
duction methods.
The power of a nation now depends on its eco-
nomic performance—and therefore its capacity to
innovate.All stakeholders, including the state and
the unive rs i t i e s , are supposed to strengthen this
capacity. Research facilities have been rejigged to
t u rn out new products more quickly and more
cheaply (page 27). Scientists are valued less for
their disinterestedness than for their feel for market
e f fic i e n cy. B a rri e rs between public and pri vate sec-
tors have become blurred.Bridges have been built
b e t ween the two which scientists cross in increasing
n u m b e rs (page 20).The difference has also become
fuzzy between basic and applied research, which
now interact continually (page 23).The synergy is
especially close in high-tech companies, w h i c h
account for 40 per cent of private sector industrial
R&D in the rich countries.
These trends, which have developed with the
g l o b a l i z ation of world trade, h ave strengthened the
grip of the big three—the United Stat e s , Europe and
Japan—on research (pages 28-29). Some A s i a n
countries, such as China (page 32), are boosting
their capacity for innovat i o n , but whole regions are
being left out.Science outside the big three coun-
t ries registered significant advances at the begi n n i n g
of the century—in medicine, agriculture, natural
sciences and economics—and then grew strongly in
new independent stat e s. In the past few ye a rs ,
research activity has diminished in some Lat i n
American countries. It has collapsed in the former
Soviet bloc countries and is subject to “desertifi-
cation” in black Africa.
Meanwhile,research is being partly globalized
itself as international co-operation grows (again,
mainly between the big three and between Asian
c o u n t ri e s ) , if only because gove rnment spending on
research has been cut in each country (page 30).
The upheavals which have affected the world’s
4.5 million or so scientists and engi n e e rs have set off
lively debate. By trying to make science serve the
m a r k e t , is there not a risk of depriving most of
humanity of its benefits? By forcing unive rs i t i e s
and state-funded laborat o ries to increase their pro-
fit a b i l i t y, might we not kill off basic research, w h e r e
the public sector plays a key role? How can we
fight abuses of pat e n t i n g, which is no longer limited
to protecting the applications of research but now
extends to “privatizing”certain discoveries?
H ow can we fight the emergence of a culture of
s e c r e cy which threatens the free flow of know l e d g e
(pages 25-26)? How can we prevent whole areas of
research from being neglected, with only a few
“ t e c h n o l o gical pat h way s ” being explored, w h e n
more and more firms are trying to establish mono-
polies by imposing their standards? In the era of
genetics and the virtual, how can we build ethical
safeguards and reconcile the precautionary pri n c i p l e
with that of maximum profitability?
All these questions should spur intern at i o n a l
d e c i s i o n - m a k e rs to once more promote truly unive rs a l
s c i e n t i fic activity (see box above ) .They should also
d r aw public opinion into a debate that must be held
about the funding and aims of research (pages 35-36).
But before that can happen, people need to know
w h at ’s really happening. n

B u d a p e s t,
world science capital
Despite its astonishing progress and social and economic impact, science is currently facing
a crisis of confidence and investment,as well as a debate about its ethics. UNESCO and
the International Council for Science (IC S U) are organizing a conference in Budapest from June
26 to July 1,1999,to discuss these and other issues. The gathering,called “Science for the
21st Century:a New Commitment”, will turn the city into the temporary world capital of science.
According to UN E S C O’s Director- G e n e r a l , Federico Mayor, the meeting, the first at this level
for 20 years, will enable “scientists, decision-makers and other stake-holders to address the
major issues at the interface between science and society together and negotiate a new social
contract.”
Bodies like the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OE C D) , the Euro-
pean Laboratory for Particle Physics (CE R N) and the World Bank, along with N a t u r e m a g a z i n e
and experts from all scientific fie l d s, will have six days of discussions culminating in the adop-
tion of two documents: a Declaration on Science, which will stress a political commitment to
s c i e n t i fic progress, and a Science A g e n d a — Framework for A c t i o n , which will encourage scien-
tific organizations to promote development and environmental improvement.
IC S U’s Executive Director, J e a n - François Stuyck-Ta i l l a n d i e r, says that the most ground-brea-
king feature of the Budapest meeting is that scientists will come face to face with public and
p r i vate sector decision-make r s. “ We want to improve the public’s perception of science, s h o w
that much has been done, and that much remains to be done, but that we can’t do everything
because there are ethical issues to be considered.” n

Regina Reszka started out working in East Germany’s re s e a rc h
l a b o ra t o r i e s.After the Berlin wall came down, she took a crash course 
in capitalism

Although conventional wisdom still sees basic science 
as distinct from industrial re s e a rc h , it is actually very hard to draw 
the line between the two
The science-tech c o n v e rg e n c e
n
For Regina Reszka of Berlin, the hardest part
is juggling two careers: research and business.
“There’s an abyss between the worlds of com-
merce and science,” says the 46-year-old chemist,
who founded a biotechnology company called
GOT in 1995. She embodies a new breed of
scientist,found around the world, who are increa-
singly at home with balance-sheets as well as test-
tubes. Reszka has never stopped working in the
lab and says she is still a researcher deep down.
But these days, scientific results are not the only
thing she is after. She must also come up with
funding.
GOT works on cancer-fighting substances
based on liposomes, which are tiny drops of fat.
The main gene-therapy technique the company is
developing helps enhance them with bits of DNA
capable of limiting the spread of cancer cells. It
could be used in cases where chemo- or radiation
therapy fails.
Reszka was not trained to win markets and fin d
sponsors. She studied chemistry in Leipzig before
s t a rting her career on the eastern side of the Berlin
wa l l , at the cancer research institute that was a part
of East Germany’s powerful Academy of Sciences.
After reunification in 1990, she joined the Max
Delbrück centre of molecular medicine (MDC), a
major national research institution.But Reszka no
longer found her work fulfilling.Tired of writing
scientific articles and speaking at congresses, she
wanted to help alleviate the suffering of cancer
p atients in a direct way. So she founded a company
for what she calls “ethical” reasons.
Reszka and her five colleagues started GOT with
nothing but their savings (450,000 Deutschmarks, o r
$ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 ) . But they had good reason to think that the
e x p e rience was wo rth try i n g . In the 1990s, m a ny
r e s e a r c h e rs in the former German Democratic Repu-
blic caught the business bu g .M a ny had lost their jobs
when laborat o ries closed down and research insti-
tutions were restructured in 1992. S e veral form e r
A c a d e my of Sciences institutes shut dow n , l e av i n g
14,000 scientists unemploye d .The result: the crea-
tion of a slew of small companies.
n
Industrial managers are being asked today to
s o l ve two seemingly contradictory problems: o n
the one hand, to produce more innovat i ve pro-
ducts based on the latest science, and on the other,
to drastically cut costs and reduce the time it takes
to get these products to the market.
The first task requires access to the best unive rs i t y
s c i e n c e , the capability to perform imagi n at i ve research,
and a creat i ve environment in which to innovat e .T h e
second requires focus on near-term product sche-
d u l e s , disciplined use of resources, and limitat i o n s
on technical ri s k s.These requirements,which may pull
in opposing directions, h ave always been with us. B u t
in less competitive , less technically sophisticated times
they were accomplished in sequence.A scientific dis-
c ove ry was followed by applied research to build a
prototype of a commercial product. Only then wo u l d
a company put its engi n e e rs to wo r k ,d e veloping the
processes to produce it.
This sequential approach can take a long time.To
take one example of the process of finding a com-
mercial use for a scientific discove ry, scientists have
been trying for a decade to make mat e rials that exhibit
superconductivity at near room temperat u r e . So fa r
they have had little success,but if they do succeed,e l e c-
t ricity would flow without resistance, making pos-
sible a new world of more efficient electrical devices.
But early applications of the most radical disco-
ve ries are seldom successful.So innovat o rs today are
focusing their energy on concurrent pursuit of both the
science and the commercial idea. Science is no longer
a stranger to technology; i n d e e d ,product and process
ideas come together with science through basic
r e s e a r c h , leading to eve r - i m p r oving technology.

Lewis M. Branscomb
*Journalist in Berlin,Germany
The German gove rnment has encouraged
biotechnology development for several years. In
1996, the research ministry granted GOT a 1.4-
million-Deutschmark (approximately $800,000)
subsidy. In November 1998, the Länder of Berlin
and Brandenburg awarded the company their
Innovation Prize. Its team works at the Max
Delbrück centre, which groups together hospi-
tals, public institutions and laboratories rented
out to private companies. One of GOT’s star pro-
cesses has been patented as part of an MDC-
managed project.
Reszka says the company’s priority is to begin
the second stage of tests on this process. She
needs “a partner with strong nerves” because the
o p e r ation will cost 10 million Deutschmarks
(approximately $5.5 million). She met several
other recently-founded biotechnology firms and
venture capital companies at the Bio-Europe
Pa rt n e ring conference held in Berlin in
December 1998. Venture-capital firms invest in
innovative projects, making big profits if major
companies purchase their innovations and put
them into mass production.
American companies were out in force at the
conference. With biotechnology innovation pro-
gressing at a snail’s pace in North America since
1997, they are increasingly interested in Europe.
“I was amazed to hear Americans making me
offers to set up a joint-venture right away,” says
Reszka. “We’re negotiating with two major lipo-
some-manufacturers based in the United States.”
Reszka is out to win the West—unless the opposi-
te happens. n
The merging of scientific research and com-
mercial innovation has been made possible by the
total transform ation of science and engi n e e ri n g
since the Second World Wa r. Before 1940 most
technical knowledge was based on empirical obser-
vat i o n .The power of scientific prediction based on
m at h e m atical theory was we a k ; new ideas could
only be va l i d ated by building prototypes and testing
t h e m .S c i e n c e , since the Wa r , has made such extra-
ordinary progress that all this has changed.
Take the case of IBM’s largest computers, in
which the design of the product and the technology
from which it is constructed must be deve l o p e d
concurrently. Faster circuits require a new archi-
tecture for the computer. But you cannot test that
architecture in a prototype without the new cir-
cuits in hand. Product cycle times can be cut in half
by computer simulation of both the circuits and the
m a c h i n e . When the first machine comes off the
production line no working prototype has ever been
built,except in cyberspace.

E ven the most complicated molecules and mat e-
rials can now be designed to meet specific com-
mercial needs. Computer codes and va l i d ated law s
of nature can also be used to create molecules and
m at e rials that never existed in nat u r e .P h a rm a c e u-
tical companies that build designer molecules to
h ave predictable therapeutic properties must wo r k
very close to the limits of chemical and biological
k n ow l e d g e .The margin between basic science and
applied technology is hard to find.
Technology roadmaps to guide
corporate strategy
Basic science plays another essential role in
high-technology innovation by making possible
i n f o rmed choices between altern at i ve technologi e s.
Robert Galvin, the imaginative former Chief Exe-
c u t i ve Officer of Motorola Corp o r at i o n1, p l a c e s
gr e at importance on the preparation of “ t e c h n o l o g y
r o a d m a p s ” to guide corp o r ate technology strat e g y.
These roadmaps describe what future improve-
ments in technology our scientific knowledge allow s.
Using them, it is possible to pick the technology with
the greatest promise for future improvement.
In a situation where further improvements in a
c u rrent technology are increasingly difficult to make,
the timing of a decision to shift to an altern at i ve
with a more extendable future may be a life-and-deat h
decision for the firm . Ralph Gomory, when director
of research for IBM in the 1970s and early 1980s,
organized teams of researchers to acquire the scien-
t i fic knowledge that allows wise choices among tech-
n o l o gi e s.Analysis made on the basis of this approach
g ove rned IBM’s decision to abandon the pursuit of
superconducting Josephson junctions, a radical alter-
n at i ve to the use of semiconductors in integr at e d
c i r c u i t s , as a replacement for more conve n t i o n a l
silicon-based semiconductors. S i m i l a r l y, IBM found
the technology roadmap for silicon-gate semicon-
ductor memory chips leading to many ye a rs of impro-
ve m e n t , while the roadmap for the metal-gate tech-
nology IBM was then using appeared to be
d e a d - e n d e d ,e ven though it was cheaper at the time.
E ven the institutional setting for innovation is
c h a n gi n g,c h a l l e n ging our conventional thinking about
basic science as something distinct from industri a l
r e s e a r c h .The central corp o r ate laborat o ry is still the
site for the basic research performed by the most
technically aggr e s s i ve , science-based firm s. But these
l a b o r at o ries are smaller, and more focused in that
common ground of motivated scientific and techno-
l o gical research that I have descri b e d .And the role of
technical innovator is shifting to the smaller, highly spe-
cialized firm s.
These small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
are more technically specialized firms that can move
faster and with more imagination than their much
bigger customers.They are often part of their cus-
t o m e rs ’ i n n ovation system, s h a ri n g, over the
I n t e rn e t , a computer design system that allows the
SME to become a member of the larger firm ’s
design team.The result is a boost to productivity and
innovation in the economy as a whole. It accounts
for much of the sustained economic growth in the
U.S. recently and represents a challenge to those
societies with weak high-tech SME sectors.
‘Jeffersonian science’
H ow should we describe the kind of research in
which science and technology are merged and which
is motivated by visions of new possibilities? The lat e
Donald E. S t o k e s , of Princeton Unive rs i t y, c a l l e d
such research “ Pa s t e u r ’s Quadrant”, contrasting Louis
Pa s t e u r ’s “use-inspired basic research” with what
Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr called “pure basic
r e s e a r c h ” .H a rva r d ’s Gerald Holton reminds us that
in the early 19th century President Thomas Je f f e rs o n
commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the
Pa c i fic Nort h west to collect ve ry basic scientific infor-
m ation about ecology and Nat i ve A m e rican languages,
but for a ve ry clear and important applied purp o s e .
“ Je f f e rsonian science” m ay have the practical
goals we associate with technology,but it must be per-
f o rmed in the creat i ve , intellectually competitive
e nvironment we associate with basic science. S o m e
might think that “basic technology research” is a
contradiction in term s. I see it as characteristic of
much industrial science.Once there is general accep-
tance of the idea that science and high technology
h ave merged and must be pursued concurr e n t l y,we
can simply call the combination “ r e s e a r c h ” .
Of cours e , there is no way even the largest firm can
be self-sufficient in scientific know l e d g e . E ven the
best corp o r ate research laborat o ry can only be a
w i n d ow on the world of technical know l e d g e .Since the
i n n ovat i ve SMEs have relat i vely short - t e rm hori z o n s ,
and the big companies have cut back on corp o r at e
research as they rely more on the SMEs, the bu r d e n
for keeping the knowledge base expanding falls on uni-
ve rsities and national research institutions.
Most governments are trying to increase their
i nvestments in this knowledge infrastru c t u r e . I n
order to keep the work in touch with the world of
i n d u s t rial research, i n c e n t i ves are offered for colla-
b o r ation between unive rsities and industry.Thus the
i n n ovation system is becoming a process carried out
by a network of institutions, in which academic
science, large company research, and SME inno-
vation are linked.This is the direction in which all
advanced economies are headed. n

Little in life fits into neat boxes dividing one
set of objectives from another. And science is
far from an exception. I have in mind the pre-
mise that pure research, m o t i vated exclusively by
the search for knowledge for its own sake, has suf-
fered from the rise in technological or applied
r e s e a r c h . As industry increasingly invests in and
c o l l a b o r ates with the academic wo r l d , some people
assume that scientists have strayed from the goal of
“ a d vancing know l e d g e ” to “ c r e ating we a l t h ” .
There is no denying the trend towards indus-
t rial funding of unive rsity research which began in
the 1970s and has since intensifie d . In the United
S t ates for example, i n d u s t ry ’s share of academic
R&D support rose from 2.6 percent in 1970 to
almost seven per cent in 1995, an almost eight-fold
increase in absolute R&D purchasing powe r. B u t
a g gr e g ate data do not suggest that a rise in applied
research means a cut in pure (also referred to as
“ f u n d a m e n t a l ” or “basic”) scientific research.
There are several reasons. F i rs t , i n d u s t rial money
is just too small a fraction of unive rs i t i e s ’ t o t a l
research budgets to have such an effect.
More import a n t l y, in most areas of scientific
e n d e avo u r , the goals are a mix of pure and applied
r e s e a r c h . In the past few decades, pure research
has led  to highly profitable and socially va l u a b l e
products or know l e d g e . At the same time, p r o fit -
m o t i vated inventions and new technologi e s — t h at
is to say, applied science—have provided new tools
for breakthroughs in pure research.
Einstein and the laser
Consider the example of nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). This was a “pure” research
discovery made in 1946 on the ways in which cer-
tain nuclei act as tiny magnets. Scientists then
could scarcely have imagined the practical appli-
cations which would lead to today’s multi-billion
dollar industry in magnetic resonance medical
imaging (MRI),which doctors use to scan the tis-
sues and bones of patients in diagnosing cance-
rous tumours or hair-line fractures. But the origi-
nal discovery only provided the opportunity for
the applications. To realize these required a great
deal of additional sophisticated engi n e e ri n g,
applied science and commercial development.
Likewise, the notion of pure research being
separate from applied science fails us in tracing
the  development of fibre-optic communications,
in which glass or plastic fibres transfer light waves
generated from lasers, whose amplitude is then
modulated to carry information for telephone
conversations or TV programmes. In 1905 Albert
Einstein first predicted the idea of stimulated
emission of electromagnetic radiation, a pure
research principle  underpinning lasers. But it
wa s n ’t until 1960 that T. H . M a i m a n , a n
American scientist, built the first laser. Yet, to
actually use lasers for communications applica-
tions required scientists to learn to make fine
glass optical fibres of unheard of purity. To achie-
ve that end, scientists needed to do fundamental
research on the nature of defects and impurities
in materials—but with a very well-defined practi-
cal objective (i.e., communications). In addition,
fibre-optic communications required a good deal
of engineering. Thus, the journey from the pure
scientific research of Einstein to the development
of fibre-optic communications involved a com-
plex interplay of pure research and application-
motivated fundamental research.
These examples demonstrate that the notion
of pure and applied science waning and waxing at
the expense of each other just doesn’t hold water.
There are just a few fields—like particle physics,
cosmology and some areas of pure mathematics
—in which the research agenda can be determi-
ned exclusively by the conceptual structure of the
subject without regard for possible societal or
business applicat i o n s. But generally speaking,
pure science discoveries open up unsuspected
opportunities of application, while at the same
time the search for technological applications
often invites us into new areas of fundamental
research. n
F i b re optics and medical scanners are among the many offshoots of the give-and-take
between applied and pure science

How does the giant chemical and biotechno-
logy company Monsanto manage to keep
control of its herbicide Roundup, e ve n
though other companies now have the right to
make it? The answer to this simple question
r e veals the power of pri vate sector research.
Under the pressure of competition, firms have
developed formidable capacities to innovate and
to market their discoveries.
Monsanto, with a turnover of more than $8
billion in 1998, is an excellent example of such a
firm. Several of its discoveries have helped far-
mers and consumers. It developed the biodegra-
dable herbicide Roundup in the early 1970s.
Farmers who use it are relieved of the long and
tiresome job of weeding. They just have to take
care not to damage their crops as they apply the
herbicide, which can increase yields by an estima-
ted 30-50 per cent and bring more land into cul-
tivation.
A big 
money-spinner
Roundup, which can be used on about 100
crops, is a big money-spinner for Monsanto,
though its exact contribution to the firm’s profits
is not known. In the early 1990s, the herbicide’s
patent expired in several European countries and
the product was copied by rival firms. Monsanto
did not lose control of it however.
Monsanto’s research teams are in close and
constant communication with the firm’s sales
force, who monitor changes in the market, and
with its strategic planners, who work out what
kind of future a product has. So when Roundup
was no longer legally protected, Monsanto was
ready. Since 1989, the firm has come up with
many by-products of the herbicide.These can be
sold at a higher price than the basic product,
whose manufacturing costs fell by around 20 per
cent between 1990 and 1998.
The economic goal of Monsanto’s researchers
is to encourage work which is part of its industrial
s t r ategy and drop work which is outside it.
Products arising from such research are also
quickly put on the market. Monsanto, like most
other chemical and pharmaceutical companies,
spends four to five times more on advertising and
marketing than it does on research in the strict
sense.
To stay ahead of the pack, the firm asks its
researchers to anticipate changes in the market.
In 1972, a biochemist in its agricultural division,
Ernest Jawarsky, went back to university to study
cell growth. Seven years later, he set up the firm’s
Molecular Biology Group (MBG), which in 1982
succeeded in genetically altering a plant’s cells.
The American firm Monsanto’s flagship pro d u c t , R o u n d u p, highlights a strongpoint 
of private-sector re s e a rch—its capacity to create and market new pro d u c t s
Staying a h e a d of the pack Pascal Byé*
The MBG has ties with consultants trained at
many prestigious institutions, such as Berlin’s
Max Planck Institute. In this way, it taps into the
findings of state-funded research on the genome
of plants to further its goal of extending the life of
Roundup.
In 1988, Monsanto announced it had develo-
ped genetically-modified plants that were immu-
ne to Roundup. If farmers used them, they would
no longer have to take precautions to prevent the
herbicide from damaging their crops.The compa-
ny is creating new outlets. Cotton, for example,
requires a lot of herbicides but is damaged by
some of them. By developing a cotton seed resis-
tant to Roundup, Monsanto opened up a new
market—one for new seeds—and at the same
time expanded the market for its own herbicide,
which can now be used by cotton growers.
Industrial research often seems more valuable
and less suspect than publicly funded research,
which is sometimes accused of going off in expen-
sive directions. There is a downside, however. To
ensure profitability, Monsanto has dropped entire
areas of research. Its new products are also
increasingly seen as a threat to the environment
by those who oppose genetically-modified orga-
nisms (GMO). They are also condemned by
those who think plant seeds should remain part of
the common heritage of humanity. n

“In practice,the distinction between invention
and discovery in areas such as genetics and infor-
mation technology is becoming increasingly mea-
ningless and irrelevant,” says patent lawyer Simon
Cohen of the London-based company Tay l o r
Johnson Garrett.
This interpretation is increasingly accepted by
the court s. In a number of landmark cases, f o r
e x a m p l e , both U. S . and European courts have
upheld the claim that the knowledge of the sequence
of chemical bases that makes up a human or animal
gene—whose undisputed status as a major “disco-
ve ry ” is endorsed by its announcement in the pages
of prestigious journals such as N at u r e and S c i e n c e—
can be patented.
The only caveat is that this knowledge must be
s h own to have some potential commercial va l u e .B u t
t h at is seldom difficult to demonstrat e , for example
by using knowledge of, s ay, a gene discovered to be
i nvo l ved in breast cancer to design a test to seek out
mutations in the gene that indicate increased sus-
ceptibility to the disease. The courts have gi ve n
similar endorsement to the patenting of mat h e m a-
tical algorithms.
At the same time, h owe ve r , this trend—and par-
ticularly the patenting of scientific discove ries on
living processes such as animal cell lines or genetically
e n gineered animals—has become increasingly the
target of critics such as environmentalists and animal
rights support e rs concerned at the potential implica-
tions on control of access to scientific knowledge that
it represents.
Three criticisms in particular are being widely
heard.The first,primarily from the scientific com-
munity, is that the growing ability to patent scien-
tific “ d i s c ove ri e s ” is encouraging researchers to
construct a wall of secrecy around their work that
directly challenges the traditions of open commu-
n i c ation on which modern science has depended for
its vitality and success.
Up to now, science has thri ved on the sharing of
e x p e rimental results, often ve ry preliminary,b e t we e n
c o l l e a g u e s. Much of science develops through debat e s

In pra c t i c e, the distinction 
between invention and discovery 
in areas such as genetics 
and information technology 
is becoming incre a s i n g l y
meaningless and irre l e v a n t
* British journalist
David Dickson* As a result of hothouse pre s s u re to patent scientific discoveries,
the debate and sharing of experimental results that tra d i t i o n a l l y
stimulated re s e a rch are giving way to a culture of secre c y
O p e n house or closed s h o p ?
n
There was a time when basic scientific know-
ledge was considered primarily to be a public
good.The argument was that since most of it
was produced through public funding—namely the
g ove rn m e n t ’s support of unive rsities—and intended
to benefit society as a whole, no one should be able
to control access to it by others.
Today, however, all that has changed.The key
role of science at the heart of the modern “know-
ledge economy” means that what was previously
seen as a public good is being transformed into a pri-
vate commodity.
Two industries in particular have been respon-
sible for this shift. One is the biotechnology industry,
where information about the detailed structure of
living cells and individual genes, previously of
interest primarily to the laboratory biologist, now
offers the possibility of being rapidly transformed
into profitable pharmaceutical products or medical
screening technologies.
The second is the inform ation technology industry.
Up to now, m at h e m atical formulae were considered
to be too abstract—and,by implicat i o n ,too accessible
to anyone with the appropri ate intellectual skills—to
be considered pri vate propert y.But the reliance of high-
p owered computing on sophisticated mat h e m at i c a l
a l g o rithms has led to a gr owing acceptance that eve n
m at h e m atical formulae can in certain circumstances
be treated as pri vate propert y.
A controversial
trend
Under challenge in both cases is an important
distinction that,previously, was used to define the
limit of what could be patented.This is the dis-
tinction between a scientific “ d i s c ove ry ” ( w h i c h
could not be patented) and a technical “ i nve n t i o n ”
(which can).
To d ay, h owe ve r , the speed with which scientific
discoveries can be turned into technical products
and the large commercial profits that can be gene-
r ated by this process means that , in practice, the dis-
tinction between discove ry and invention has
become blurred.As a result, the moral distinction
b e t ween what should and what should not be
p atented has once again become highly conten-
tious.
I n d u s t ry ’s argument is straightforwa r d . If it has
“paid” for a certain useful scientific discovery by
s u p p o rting the scientists—either in its own labora-
t o ri e s , or even in a unive rsity—who made it, then it
has a right to seek a return on its investment by char-
ging others for using this discove ry (or even keeping
it for its own exclusive use).
“ I n ventions cannot, i n
n at u re, be a subject of
p ro p e r t y.”

But scientists are now being wa rned that , i f
they discuss their results openly prior to publishing
them in a scientific journ a l , they run two ri s k s. O n e
is that, if someone reports these discussions—for
example, in the proceedings of a conference—this
can be taken as a form of “ p u b l i c at i o n ”t h at can jeo-
pardize their chance of being awarded a patent.
This is because, at least in Europe,a patent appli-
c ation must be made before an invention or discove ry
is made public (the rules in the United States are
more fle x i b l e ,a l l owing a scientist a “ grace peri o d ”o f
12 months after publication of a new discove ry
d u ring which a patent application can be fil e d ) .
The second risk is that an unscrupulous col-
league, overhearing an original idea from another
r e s e a r c h e r ,m ay hastily incorp o r ate it into his or her
own patent applicat i o n , without divulging where the
idea originated from.
In order to avoid either situation ari s i n g, s c i e n-
tists are now being advised—for example, by pat e n t
lawyers—not to divulge their results to colleagues
until it has been completed and full patent protec-
tion has been applied for.
Secrecy
on the campus
The result is a growing “culture of secrecy” in
u n i ve rsities where even researchers working in
n e i g h b o u ring laborat o ries are reported to be increa-
singly reluctant to discuss their fin d i n g s ,e ven though
failure to do so may slow down the scientific dis-
covery process.
The issue of gr owing secrecy on unive rsity cam-
puses was highlighted at a recent meeting sponsored
jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Te c h n o l o g y
and the A m e rican A s s o c i ation for the A d va n c e m e n t
of Science.
“ Pa rt of the failure lies with academics who think
‘by God, I’m going to be ri c h ,”Alan Goldhammer of
the Biotechnology Industry Organization told the
m e e t i n g . John Deutch, f o rmer dean of science at
M I T, d e s c ribed secrecy as “a major threat to science
and . . . antithetical to the purpose of unive rs i t i e s.”
A second cri t i c i s m , coming mainly from cri t i c s
of genetic engi n e e ri n g, is that permitting patents on
biomedical discove ries—such as new genes, or eve n
parts of genes—is inherently immoral, as humans
h ave no moral basis for claiming commercial ri g h t s
over living matter.
The third question addresses the issue of Nort h -
South equity in a world where both scientific know l e d g e
and economic power are unequally divided. Here the
argument is that those countries that are already the most
economically powerful are being allowed to increase their
dominance by exploiting the fact that they also control
access to the scientific knowledge that increasingly prov i d e s
the basis of this powe r.
The battle is far from ove r. M a ny scientists, f o r
e x a m p l e , are now insisting that inform ation deri ve d
from their efforts be placed in the public domain.T h o s e
attending an intern ational meeting in Bermuda in
Fe b ru a ry 1996, for example, designed to establish a
common framework for human genome sequencing—
d e c i p h e ring the precise sequence of the amino-acid
bases that make up a single strand of human DNA—
urged that all sequence data produced by centres funded
for large-scale sequencing should be placed in the public
d o m a i n .
Most of those engaged in these debates accept that
the distinction between discovery and invention is no
l o n g e r , in itself, a valid basis for determining the boun-
dary line between public and private knowledge.The
challenge ahead is to rewrite the rules of the game in a
socially equitable and morally acceptable way. n
The argument is that those countries
that are already the most
economically powerful are being
allowed to increase their dominance
by exploiting the fact that they also
c o n t rol access to the scientific
knowledge that incre a s i n g l y

directed towards industrial applicat i o n s , at the
expense of basic research.To d ay, they are shifting the
balance of their strat e g y. In Europe, the United
Kingdom was the first country to encourage the ri s e
of industrial research. Even France, which places
very strong emphasis on basic research, is going
down that road.
Might this change in focus not be harmful in the
long run?
Nowadays,a country’s economic performance
depends more than ever on its capacity to innovat e .
Research is adapting to this world trend and is
being harnessed to the economy. But gove rn m e n t s ,
especially in North America, have become aware
t h at they cannot neglect basic research. In the short
term, applied research undoubtedly leads to tech-
nological innovation.But in the long run,without
the reservoir of knowledge produced by basic
r e s e a r c h ,i n n ovation breaks dow n .E ven corp o r at i o n s
h ave made a commitment to basic research, w h i c h
until now was conducted in public-sector labora-
t o ries funded by the stat e .To create new products,
they need scientists capable of understanding what
is going on in the public sector, building relations
with that sector and drawing on its results.
Today, the problem no longer lies in deciding
whether basic or applied research should be the
p ri o ri t y, but in striking a balance between them, d i s-
tributing tasks and organizing exchanges between
universities and the corporate world. Many coun-
t ries are experimenting with these issues and looking
for solutions. France encourages gr a d u ate students
to work with corp o r ations and public-sector resear-
c h e rs to set up their own bu s i n e s s e s. Japan is urgi n g
academics to patent their breakthroughs in order to
profit from them and to co-operate more closely
with pri vate industry, which used to be considered
as a comedown. n
Interview by Sophie Boukhari
UNESCO’s World Science Report describes 
three main models for conducting and funding
scientific research. What’s your thinking 
about this?
There certainly are three major models. By and
l a r g e , Japan invests ve ry little in defence, a n d
industry still dominates research. Europe empha-
sizes basic civil research and the United States puts
more stress on military research. But the three
models are converging.
How did these “models” develop and why are they
converging?
As far back as the late 19th century, Japan
focused on applied science to catch up with the
West. After the Second World War, all the major
i n d u s t rialized countries made massive inve s t-
ments in basic research, which they considered
the driving force behind progress. Japan couldn’t
afford such a luxury at that time. But once it
became a world power, it realized that it could
produce itself the knowledge that gives rise to
t e c h n o l o gical innovat i o n . In the 1970s, t h e
government began investing more in research,
almost 80 per cent of which was financed by the
private sector. In 1995, it earmarked some $140
billion for research over a five-year period (1995-
2000). The primary goal is to strengthen public
institutions and basic research.
Europe and the United States have moved in
the opposite direction. After the Second World
War, they went for pure research. Their econo-
mies were flourishing. The prevailing ideology
suggested that science would bring economic and
social progress. In the 1970s, those countries
became aware that basic research, which is very
expensive, was not always profitable in the short
term.And Japan’s example showed that economic
growth was not necessarily linked to investment
in pure research.
After the Cold War, the United States curbed
their military budget and went all-out on research * Observatory of Sciences and Technology, France

The top twenty
The table at right ranks countries in terms of their
share of world scientific output as measured by the
production of articles that appear in scientific publi-
c at i o n s1.There is remarkable continuity between the
t wo periods considered, with the same 20 countri e s
a p p e a ring on both lists.The United States accounts
for the lion’s share of scientific activity, p r o d u c i n g
more than one-third of all publications recorded by the
SCI dat a b a s e .There is howe ve r , strong competition
for the runner-up position.Although this is still held
by the UK, Japan inched up its share by 1.3% and Ger-
m a ny by 1.2%. In the lat t e r ’s case, u n i fic ation playe d

of total output.
Taken as an entity, the European Union has
i m p r oved its position and has gained a competitive
e d g e : it succeeded in ove rtaking the U. S . ,with 35.9%
of all papers signed by an author with a European
address between 1990 and 1995, against 35.1% by
a U. S .a u t h o r. I n d i a ’s decrease is cause for concern
and could reflect an unfort u n ate draining of scientists

based on the Scientific Citation Index (SCI) database
established for bibliographic purposes by the Institute for
Scientific Information (ISI) in Philadelphia, USA.
Regarded as one of the most accurate reflections of where
countries stand in terms of research activity, the SCI
measures scientific output by the number of articles
published in scientific journals.The database provides
systematic coverage of the articles from the 2,500 most
cited scientific journals. It should also be stressed that data
tend to focus on basic rather than applied research or
technology. These data are used by other institutions,such
as the European Commission, which produces the
European Report on Science and Technology Indicators.

International collaboration
Figure at left shows the instances of co-
authorship between the three major producers of
scientific articles, namely the United States, the
European Union and Japan. It is worth noting
that output is practically equal in the U.S.and the
EU. Japan more often co-operates with the U.S.,
although other data indicate an increase in co-
authorships with the EU. Less than 20% of
papers in the U.S. and Japan are internationally
co-authored,a figure that reaches between 30 and
40% in the EU because of the links between
scientists from different European countries.
Data can also provide a more detailed insight
into how international collaboration evolves over
time. In one analysis, links between 14 countries2
were studied between 1985 and 1995 using the
Salton measure, which distinguishes we a k ,
medium and strong links. The change is striking:
whereas in 1985, only 7 countries, all developed

which were weak, in 1995, the picture was signi-
ficantly different.All 14 countries had internatio-
nal co-operation links with one or more coun-

Although weak, the two developing countries in

ged links over this period.
I n t e rn ational co-authorship reflects more than
c o l l a b o r ation between individual scientists. I t
points to emerging part n e rships between the insti-

g ove rnment and industry. In developed countri e s ,
these are becoming the norm . In less deve l o p e d

science is often extemely weak or non-existent,

this is counterbalanced by the stat e , when public
science is recognized as an important engine of
economic progress in the global economy. n

As well as measuring scientific activity in terms of the number of articles published, data also
enable us to draw up different publication profiles, pointing to relative specializations that
are specific to different parts of the world. Four main models can be distinguished:
The “Western model” characterizes publication patterns in the developed Western countries,
where clinical medicine and biomedical research are the leading fields of specialization;
The  model specific to the former countries of the Soviet bloc,along with China,where the
emphasis has traditionally been on chemistry and physics;
The bioenvironmental model is more specific to Australia and to developing countries, w h e r e
efforts are concentrated in the fields of biology, earth and space sciences;
The Japanese model,now also characteristic of other developed Asian economies, is predo-
minantly focused on the engineering sciences and chemistry. n
The North-South g a p
Why does so much scientific research—and more
and more—originate from the the United States, t h e
European Union and Japan? Their share of it, as measured
by the number of scientific publications, increased from
73.3% in 1990 to 74.8% in 1995.1
John Rumble, chairman of the International Council
for Science’s committee on data for science and techno-
logy (CODATA ) , believes that the answer lies in the close
correlation between research capacity and economic
p o w e r.“ The percentages of government funds devoted to
research are approximately the same, regardless of the
c o u n t r i e s,” he says, at least among large and medium ran-
king countries.
Just as national budgets vary widely, so there are huge
differences in research budgets from country to country.
And since inequalities of wealth persist, the interna-
tional scientific hierarchy is not about to change. Th e
growing role of privately-funded research will not alter the
situation either, says Rumble, since the strength of a
c o u n t r y ’s business sector is also proportional to national
wealth.
The rise of the Internet has confirmed the trend.
“Many new research activities have been generated by
the Web,” says Rumble.The richer a country is, the more
it uses the Internet.And the cost of “admission”to the
club of world scientific powers is increasingly high. B e f o r e
a country can take off, it has to create a “critical mass”
of R&D resources. But the investment required for this is
beyond the means of many developing countries, espe-
cially the 48 of them at the foot of the ladder.
Some people blame these inequalities on human
factors. South African scientist Fanie de Beer says the
importance of scientific knowledge is often played down
in the countries of the South in order to resist “a blatant
imperialistic promotion of science and technology in the
Western sense”. He also points to the deadlocks that have
resulted from attempts to impose rich country models on
the nations of the South without taking into account
local conditions. Special formulas must be “ i n v e n t e d ,” h e
s a y s, which are based on “a productive integration of dif-
ferent forms of knowledge,” including “ n o n - We s t e r n
and non-scientific forms”.
Many scientists who cannot find in their own country
the basic material conditions in which to live decently and
do their job continue to leave for exile abroad.This brain
drain weakens the weak and strengthens the strong. I t ’s
a vicious circle. n

c o u n t ries to support an ambitious intern at i o n a l
research project on the tropical oceans.The synergy
b e t ween researchers around the globe made it possible
to envisage a bigger project than any one country
was willing to fin a n c e .
B o rn in 1985, the 18-nation Tropical Ocean and
Global Atmosphere Program (TOGA) started a
decade of observations that helped to minimize the
impact of the 1997/8 El Niño. Its long-term aim wa s
to establish an observation network to predict cli-
m at e . By the end of the project, in 1995, an arr ay of
about 70 bu oys—the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean
A rr ay (TAO ) — was in place, straddling the equat o ri a l
Pa c i fic.These continue to send real-time measures of
sea surface temperat u r e , s u r face wind and salinity
via sat e l l i t e s , to research centres that use the data to test
and fine-tune climate models. Ships are assigned full
time to placing and servicing the bu oy s. It is a costly
t a s k , but the annual $18 million that the U. S .a l o n e
i nvested was a small price compared to the estimat e d
$2 billion they lost in the 1982/83 El Niño.
Measuring sea level by satellite
Unlike the at m o s p h e r e , the scale of some ocean
phenomena can be relat i vely small—10 to 100 km
across—so many more data points are needed. F u r-
t h e rm o r e ,c l i m ate modelling and forecasting require an
u n i n t e rrupted series of dat a .When TOGA start e d ,a few
s atellites were making observations of the sea surfa c e ,
but cloud cover frequently obscured their view.With the
1992 launching of the Franco-U. S . To p e x / Po s e i d o n
s atellite equipped with two radar altimeters that could
see through cloud, it became possible to measure sea
l e vel to within a few centimetres.Scientists invo l ved with
TOGA were able to conve rt this inform ation into
t e m p e r ature dat a .
When TOGA ended in 1995, the scientists
r e grouped under a new $100 million per year pro-
gr a m m e — C l i m ate Va riability and Predictability
( C L I VAR)—continuing for 15 ye a rs. Using the same
bu oy s , these scientists first detected an unusual rise in
t e m p e r ature below the surface in the tropical Pa c i fic
early in 1997—first signs of an El Niño.Combining the
bu oy data with satellite images, they were able to track
its onset almost daily. When it was clearly bu i l d i n g
u p, the U. S . National Cl i m ate Centre broadcast dat a
on the Intern e t . El Niño watch centres established in
some of the vulnerable countries like Pe ru were able to
take action while others like Kenya , which did not
h ave such fa c i l i t i e s , were ill-prepared when floods and
drought hit.
The success of TOGA and CLIVAR in predicting
the 1997/98 El  Niño has confirmed that the inve s t-
ment was wo rt h w h i l e .N ow,s c i e n t i s t s ’ main aim is to
make their forecasting models even more reliable,b y
combining a supply of data from the bu oys with
images from new Jason sat e l l i t e s.The longer ahead
El Niño is detected, the gr e ater the opportunity vul-
nerable nations have of taking action. n
n
Pe ruvian fis h e rmen have known about El Niño for
hundreds of ye a rs , but until now they have neve r
been able to predict when it would stri k e .In 1982/83,
this recurring we ather pat t e rn caused an estimated $8 to
$13 billion in damages.T h e n ,e ven the wo r l d ’s leading cli-
m ate experts were not much wiser than local fis h e rm e n .
But when the 1997/98 El Niño appeared—the strongest
on record—a vast intern ational monitoring network wa s
in place.With a few months wa rn i n g, fa rm e rs in Brazil
and Australia were able to switch to crops that would not
be hit by the coming drought,while some other countri e s ,
expecting flo o d s ,d e l ayed construction projects and bu i l t
b a rri e rs.
El Niño happens when there is a reversal in the
usual wind and surface temperature pat t e rns in the tro-
pical Pacific. Scientists knew that the world’s oceans
play an important role in determining climate by sto-
ring and transporting large quantities of heat energy,
but they knew little about how oceans interact with the
atmosphere. By the early 1980s, a new generation of
s u p e r c o m p u t e rs had appeared able to run complex cli-
mate models.What was missing were the data from a
very wide area.
In 1979, the U. S . N ational Oceanic and A t m o s-
p h e ric A d m i n i s t r ation (NOAA) had a research project in
the equat o rial Pa c i fic, m e a s u ring ocean current in real

When Alexei Perchuk joined Moscow’s presti-
gious Institute of Geology, Mineralogy, Petro-
chemistry and Geochemistry in 1987, he was
looking forward to a glittering career in the best tra-
dition of Soviet science. The son of an eminent
university professor and,like him, a petrochemist,
the 24-year-old graduate was fulfilling a dream of
many fellow students at that time, for whom a job
as a researcher was still a great honour.
Today only Academicians still have real status.
Rank and file researchers like Perchuk no longer
do. A 1996 public opinion poll by Moscow’s
Centre for Science Research and Statistics sho-
wed that the three most prestigious professions in
Russia were business, banking and politics. The
three least respected groups were researchers, the
military and engineers. Very low pay—Perchuk
earns about 800 rubles ($30) a month—has com-
pletely devalued the work of scientists and engi-
neers.
To escape poverty, Russian scientists have
three choices—go into industry and earn about
$100 a month, become a “businessman” and
hope to earn millions, or go abroad. A dozen of
Perchuk’s friends have already made up their
minds—half of them have gone into business and
the rest have left the country.
Perchuk himself hasn’t decided yet. His affec-
tion for his country and his work still overrides his
money problems. Financially speaking, the insti-
tute where he works belongs to the privileged few
that have been given priority status by the govern-
ment. As a result, its scientists work in good
conditions and none of them has yet left for
abroad. But while there have been no departures,
no one new has been hired for the past 10 years.
This means that after 12 years, Perchuk is still
one of the Institute’s youngest researchers.
At national level, the situation is catastrophic.
UN E S C O’s 1998 Wo rld Science Report s ays Russia
had about 900,000 scientists involved in research
and development (R&D) when the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991. Four ye a rs later there were only
half a million.The figures are similar in other form e r
S oviet republics, especially in A rm e n i a , where R&D
scientists fell from 15,000 to only 3,000 over the
same period.
EU initiatives
Since 1993, the European Union has become
the main partner of Russia and the other former
m e m b e rs of the Soviet Union grouped as the Com-
munity of Independent States (CIS).1 It has stepped
up its aid in the hope of giving new life to its own
research and helping the ex-Soviet scientists. C o m-
mitments so far total about $155 million.
The Intern ational A s s o c i ation for the Promotion
of Co-operation with Scientists from the Newly
Independent States of the Former Soviet Union
( I N TAS) has so far backed more than 1,200 projects
to the tune of $69 million.The Intern ational Science
and Technology Centre (ISTC), founded in
M o s c ow in 1994, has sunk more than $120 million
into projects mainly to do with conve rsion from mili-
tary research.
In Fe b ru a ry 1999, the European Union and
the Russian Fe d e r ation reached agreement on a
project for scientific and technological co-operat i o n .
A p a rt from cash, the accord enables the signat o ri e s
to take part in each other’s research programmes,
except in nuclear mat t e rs.The main fields are space
r e s e a r c h , t e l e c o m m u n i c at i o n s , e nvironment and
transport.
The five main co-operation programmes with
Western countries (the European Union,Sweden,
N o r way, I c e l a n d , S w i t z e r l a n d , I s r a e l , the United
S t ates and Canada) add up to about $320 million.
Will this be enough to halt the brain drain? If this
money was used to pay the CIS’s 750,000 resear-
chers a monthly salary of $1,000,it would only be
enough to pay half of them, for one month. n

Chinese science has lagged for centuries. But economic reforms have given science in the
w o r l d ’s most populous nation a new life
C H I N A:a m a r ket-minded c o n t e n d e r
Ted Plafker*
n
C e n t u ries before Europe emerged from the
Middle A g e s , C h i n a ’s scientists began wo r-
king in advanced mat h e m atics and astronomy,
and had already claimed credit for inventing paper,
g u n p ow d e r , the compass, and the mechanical clock.
These great and early scientific achievements are
t o d ay well known to virtually eve ry Chinese school-
child. But these same schoolchildren know just as
clearly that China now lags behind in science and
technology.
Chinese offic i a l s , of cours e , k n ow it too. B u t
they also understand many of the reasons and they
h ave launched numerous initiat i ves to revitalize Chi-
nese science.The strategy centres on prodding scien-
tists to commercialize their research.While it may be
too early to yet call China a force in intern at i o n a l
s c i e n c e , the country has clearly become a playe r.
The impediments to scientific progress have
been both ancient and modern.With people and
their labour being more abundant than any other
r e s o u r c e , i n c e n t i ves for labour-saving scientific
innovations have traditionally been scarce.
More recently China has heaped other bu r d e n s
on its science establishment. One was the admi-
nistrative structure it adopted in the early 1950s
from the Soviet Union. By placing nearly all scien-
tific institutions under the military, the gove rn-
ment, or the central Academy of Sciences, China
replicated one of the Soviet system’s main flaws: a
structure that left impenetrable institutional walls
b e t ween those who created good science and those
who could apply it.
In the late 1950s, Mao Zedong launched 20
ye a rs of political mayhem and Chinese science
came to a virtual standstill.
Commercializing research
When the dust settled in 1978, Deng Xiaoping
was in charge and eager to re-open to the world.
Since then, China has done much to break down
walls between researchers and producers. Rather
than directly funding research from state coffers,
China has encouraged scientists to commercialize
their own results and generate their own funding for
further research.
Addressing China’s parliament in March 1999,
Premier Zhu Rongji spoke again of “the problem of
most scientific and technical personnel being
divorced from enterprises and markets”.
One of the main ways in which the gove rn m e n t
tries to encourage commercialization of scientific
research is the 11-year-old Torch Programme which

Until now, more than 80 per cent of Latin
American science has been funded by the
public sector. But until now, s t ates have
actually done little more to encourage the growth
of the scientific community than handing out
occasional scholarships or backing unive rs i t y
courses on the grounds that this is “good” for the
country. But there is no sign of real national
science policies.
So the development of science has been anar-
chic, shaped by the intellectual interests and incli-
nations of a scientific community whose members
are more interested in working in advanced fields
than in those directly related to society’s basic
needs.
The regi o n ’s economic capacity is a major obs-
tacle to investment in science.Scientific and tech-
nological infrastructure is poorly developed, with
R&D budgets less than 0.5 per cent of GDP. It is
s i g n i ficant that no Latin A m e rican countries feat u r e
among the wo r l d ’s top 20 nations in terms of indus-
t rial and technological pat e n t s. H owe ver a few
c o u n t ri e s , including A r g e n t i n a , Brazil and Mexico,
have excellent records in research and innovation.
For the past 15 years, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank have played a
big part in encouraging gove rnments to push applied
research and build bridges between research and
i n d u s t ry. But links with national centres of pro-
duction are still in their infancy, mainly because
industrial sectors are weak and small and generate
little demand for local research.The result is that the
s c i e n t i fic community hesitates to change its pri o ri-
ties or set more practical goals attuned to the market.
W h at ’s more, the most advanced sectors of
n ational production are subsidiaries of foreign firm s.
These have access to the parent company ’s labora-
t o ries and to exchange agreements with foreign
u n i ve rs i t i e s. In recent ye a rs , such firms have realized
that Latin America has excellent human resources
and labs and are starting to use them.This could gi ve
a new boost to scientific research.
Science and technology in Latin A m e rica are in
a transitional phase, in which the scientific com-
munity is having to rethink its role and learn how to
co-operate with other sectors. At the same time,
governments will have to adapt their policies on
science and technology to local conditions and
m e d i ate between unive rs i t i e s , labs and industry.
Governments are less and less likely to be able to
subsidize academic research and ambitious tech-
n o l o gical programmes which cannot be put to edu-
cational,economic or social use. n

Scientific Studies at the

“technology development zones” that offer firms
favourable conditions and tax incentive s. In addition,
the central government has promised to make it
easier for high-tech firms to be listed on the coun-
try’s stock exchanges.
But Chinese corp o r ate investment in science
and technology development is low, accounting for
only 0.39 per cent of sales vo l u m e .E ven for high-tech
e n t e rp ri s e s , the figure reaches only 0.6 per cent,or one
tenth the level of spending in developed countri e s.
Although the government encourages greater
p ri vate investment in science, gr owth has been slow.
O f ficials estimate that overall pri vate inve s t m e n t
increased only 2.9 per cent last year. Government
spending howe ver continues to ri s e . The 1999
budget calls for a 9.5 per cent increase in the cen-
tral allocations for science and technology. T h i s
brings total state and enterprise spending to more
than $14 billion, e q u i valent to roughly 1.5 per cent
of gross domestic product.
S t i l l , China is emerging as a contender. Fo r e i g n
scientists and foreign firms are increasingly eager to
co-operate with Chinese colleagues. More foreign
f i rms (including the likes of IBM) are basing
research facilities in China.The country frequently
launches communications satellites for other
n at i o n s. And China is engaging in increasingly
ambitious projects,like a $60 million scheme with
Germany to launch a one-tonne solar space teles-
cope in 2003.
More telling still is the fact that China’s own
b rightest scientists are showing more interest in
working in their own country. Since 1978, China has
sent 300,000 students abroad, the vast majori t y
for science or technology training.More than two
thirds have stayed abroad,however,and this brain
drain has cost China some of its best talent. But
according to the Ministry of Educat i o n , the number
or returning students is rising rapidly, and there are
now more students returning than leaving. n

Yet both sides have much to gain from this kind
of collaborat i o n . PUC Prof.Antonio José Junqueira
Botelho says firms “most of all want access to stu-
dents and researchers familiar with Brazil who can
help them ‘ t r o p i c a l i z e ’ their markets.The unive rs i-
ties get direct income—because the companies pay
t a xes or rents—and also equipment, since the firm s
install supercomputers , the latest software and
other sophisticated facilities which can be used by
local researchers.”
The Brazilian government is considering new
legislation which would oblige firms granted ope-
r ating licences in gas, oil or telecommunications to
invest in local R&D.The head of the PUC’s centre
for the development of science and technology,
P r o f. José Antonio Pimenta-Bueno, s ays pri vat e

i n i t i at i ves motivated by goodwill or the hope of
p r o fit rather than a genuine desire to advance basic
research. n

Although Brazil is one of the wo r l d ’s ten biggest
economies,it invests very little in R&D.World
Bank figures show that in 1995, the South A m e-
rican giant earmarked only 0.6 per cent of its GDP
for these activities.T h r e e - q u a rt e rs of this went to the
public sector, and the present gove rnment wants to
cut the figure to half by the year 2002.

Africa has always been on the sidelines of modern science. It produces less
than one per cent of the world’s scientific publications, according to
UNESCO. In a continent where the private sector plays a negligible role in
research,government-funded laboratories, often poorly equipped and offe-
ring low salaries, cannot keep researchers, who move to jobs abroad.
The situation has deteriorated in the last few years. Research is stagna-
ting in North Africa and is even on the decline in Egypt,which ranks second
after South Africa in the publication of scientific papers.The situation is only
improving in Morocco and Tunisia,which are fourth and fifth in the publica-
tions ranking and have almost doubled their output of papers since 1991.
At the other end of the continent, South A f r i c a , which has provided
A f r i c a ’s only Nobel laureate for science1, is slipping backwa r d s,with only 1,398
articles published in 1997,down from 2,130 in 1991.
Between the two extremes,basic research structures resemble a landscape
“turning into a desert,” says Roland Wa a s t , who is looking into A f r i c a n
science for France’s Scientific Institute for Development in Co-operation.In
recent years, he says, government-funded research institutes have “ c o l-
l a p s e d ” in several countries, such as Nigeria (even though it holds third
place in the publication rankings).Spending on research has been sharply
reduced as part of public spending cutbacks and structural adjustment poli-
cies.
“NGOs and various bilateral and international aid organizations have
t a ken over,” says Wa a s t .B u t , he notes, they are mainly funding research related
to the priorities of the rich countries, such as environmental protection and
birth control. Many researchers turn away from basic research because it isn’t
profitable. They prefer to do studies for foreigners—private firms, United
Nations agencies and NGOs. The result is that sub-Saharan Africa is losing
ground in the scientific fields which directly concern it, such as tropical
medicine and agricultural science. n

The time has come to negotiate a new social contract between science and society.
At its heart: the notion of science as a public good, especially in countries of the South.

H i r o s h i m a , C h e rn o b y l , the Bhopal chemical
plant disaster . . . the twentieth century bears
many tragic scars to remind us that the pro-
gr e s s i ve and emancipat o ry role of science and tech-
nology cannot be taken for granted.
Such terrible eve n t s , together with loss of life due
to disasters in mines, fa c t o ries and transport systems
h ave triggered public disenchantment with science
and technology. I n d i c at o rs of these anxieties are the
rise of anti-nuclear and environmental move m e n t s
in the West and the growing influence of people’s
science movements (PSMs). In India, for example,
PSMs such as the Kerala Shastra Sahitya Pa ri s h a d
(KSSP) are struggling to inculcate such scientific
values as sceptical questioning, to improve peo-
ple’s scientific literacy and to relate the results of
science and technology to the basic needs of people.
For many, this disenchantment is fuelled by
other trends.The problems are particularly acute in
the developing countri e s ,which account for less than
10 per cent of world expenditure in science and
technology research.
As part of the globalization process, the concep-
tion of science as a “market good” has spread to
these countries as a result of policies based on eco-
nomic liberalization and pri vat i z at i o n . This new
conception of science, in which market-based cri-
t e ria are applied to eva l u ate and regulate research,h a s
challenged the prevailing mode of science as a public
g o o d , and there are clear signs that research serv i n g
the ideal of “science as a public good” is stagnating or
being cut back.This is a serious problem in deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ries like India where over 80 per cent of research
and development is funded from public sources.
In these countries,science academics and pro-
fessional societies have a major social responsibility
to safeguard science from commercial interests
d ri ven by the logic of knowledge as pri vate propert y.
The state should sustain science as a public good
until these societies are able to absorb the shocks
generated by market forces.
Some advances in science and technology chal-
lenge widely held ethical values. The information
r e volution has impinged on personal pri va cy, and the
possibilities unleashed by the biological revo l u t i o n
interfere with the uniqueness and natural processes
of human beings.
There are also signs that some scientific and
t e c h n o l o gical innovations have a disturbing capacity
for harm . In agriculture chemical pesticides and her-
bicides bearing long-term risks to human beings are
used on a mass scale. Violent experiments are
conducted on animals to test safety devices and
chemical hazards. As the Indian scholar and envi-
ronmentalist Kamla Chow d h ry has observe d ,“ t h e
kind of technologies that the major nations of the
world have been developing in the military, agri-
culture and consumer industries have led to ‘vio-
l e n c e ’ , accompanied by loss of values such as com-
passion,helpfulness, reverence and spirituality.”
Closely associated with the violent and hege-
monistic aspects of modern science and technology
are questions of equity and sustainable consump-
t i o n .The idea of sustainable development cannot be
d i vorced from the structure of consumption pat t e rn s
in modern societies.The crucial issue here is whe-
ther developed countries are ready to cut down the
consumption levels which are draining non-rene-
wable resources.
All these issues lead to a single question: what
can be done to ensure that science and technology
meet the basic needs of society today, particularly
in low- and medium-income countri e s. I believe that
a new social contract needs to be made between
science and society through the democratic process.
There are four key ingredients in this process.
D e c i s i o n - m a k i n g. This should not be monopolized
by a scientific and political elite, often joined by pri-
vate corporate interests. Decision-making systems
should be enlarged to include representatives of a
wide range of interest gr o u p s , p e o p l e ’s science
groups and other social stakeholders.
Since the welfare of the majority and the equi-
table distribution of resources are fundamental to
d e m o c r a cy, the democrat i z ation of technical change
and the establishment of priorities in science and
technology call for new forms of part i c i p at o ry
decision-making and the creation of institutional

36 The UNESCO Courier - May 1999
A H i p p o c ratic oath for scientists?
Wh a t ’s the best way to make scientists think about unfo-
reseen consequences of their discoveries? Under the
auspices of UN E S C O, some 30 scientific , cultural and political
figures from many countries, led by South African judge
Richard Goldstone, have drafted a “declaration of human
duties and responsibilities” for the Valencia Foundation for the
Third Millennium.Article 12 of the declaration includes the fol-
lowing statements:
“ The research and scientific communities have a duty
to act with full respect for the life and welfare of every
human being and to take all necessary measures, i n c l u d i n g
the adoption of a code of ethics, to prevent the results of
s c i e n t i fic and technological research being used for the pur-
pose of threatening peace and security, or in a manner
which infringes upon human rights and fundamental free-
doms. Individual researchers and scientists have a duty at
all times to conduct their research in accordance with
strict ethical practices and to inform the public of any une-
thical or potentially dangerous research of which they
become aware.”
A French member of the group, the philosopher Michel
S e r r e s, has suggested adding an oath, l i ke the Hippocratic
oath doctors take, which would be sworn voluntarily by all
young students embarking on scientific research. Serres has
proposed the following form of words:
“I swear that,in whatever falls within my responsibi-
lity, I will never use my knowledge, my inventions and the
applications that I might find for them,to promote des-
truction or death, to increase poverty and ignorance, to
enslave people or to promote inequality, but instead to dedi-
cate them to achieving equality between people, to help
them live, to enhance their lives and make them more
free.”
The idea of the oath, says Serres,arose from the diffic u l t y
of drawing up a universal code of conduct amid so many dif-
ferent cultures. “A Japanese Shintoist and a Canadian Pro-
testant just don’t look in the same way at life,d e a t h ,h u m a n
destiny and the human person,”he says. H e n c e,according to
S e r r e s, the need to go back to the private individual and his
or her responsibilities.
The draft declaration of duties and responsibilities,
intended to complement the 1948 Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, has been submitted to UN E S C O D i r e c t o r-
General Federico Mayor. The proposed oath will be put
before the international scientific community at a later
date. n
“safety nets”. For example, i s o l ated tribal commu-
nities in the developing world should be repre-
sented on official regulatory commissions on sub-
jects such as biodiversity and biotechnology. The
relevance of international regimes like those pro-
posed by the United Nations Conference on Env i-
ronment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992 and the Convention on Biodive rsity should
be re-examined from the perspective of such com-
munities. In developing countries, where a major
p r o p o rtion of the research effort favo u rs the
demands and needs of privileged sections of their
societies, governments should foster participatory
decision-making systems. G ove rnments should also
increase research expenditure related to safety by
both the public and the private sector.
Social contro l . In order to control the adva n c i n g
forces of technological determinism more should
be done to educate people about the impact science
and technology will have on their live s. Science acti-
vist groups like those which have gr own up in India
h ave an important role to play in this process and
g ove rnment support should be gi ven to their activi-
t i e s.
The “neighbourhood effect”. In the deve l o p i n g
c o u n t ri e s , there should be questioning of the process
whereby academic research is dominated by themes
t h at are prevalent in the We s t .M a ny of these themes,
though important for advances in scientific know-
l e d g e , h ave no immediate relevance to the real pro-
blems of developing countri e s. M e a n w h i l e ,only resi-
dual attention is gi ven by science laborat o ries and
u n i ve rsities to problems confronted by people in their
i m m e d i ate neighbourhood, such as malnutri t i o n ,
p ove rt y,p o l l u t i o n , and industrial hazards.To enhance
their “neighbourhood effect”, science laborat o ri e s
and unive rsities should allocate part of their research
e f f o rt to solving these problems,when necessary in col-
l a b o r ation with social scientists. R e p r e s e n t at i ves from
local neighbourhoods could well become invo l ved in
such part i c i p at o ry research in formal institutions.
D e m o c racy and the scientific spirit. There is a close
link between the values of science and democracy.
If societies are to benefit from democracy their
m e m b e rs must develop the “ s c i e n t i fic temper”, i . e .
qualities such as scepticism and doubt,respect for
facts and dat a , and the questioning of assumptions
in their approach to public issues. n

250 million child worke rs in the world
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) says 250 million children between the ages of five and
14 are working—61% of them in Asia,32% in Africa,7% in Latin America and a small number in
rich countries (two million in the European Union).One in three children in Africa works, one in four
in Asia and one in five in Latin America.
On top of that,15-20% of children in developing countries work for no pay, often as domestics or
f a r m w o r ke r s.Two-thirds of child workers live in the countryside:20% of them are between 5 and 9 years
old,compared with only 5% in this same age bracket in towns and cities.
About 120 million children work full time.This means they can neither go to school or learn a trade
and have little time to play. n
strongly against boycotts of goods they
make for export , which are produced by
only 5 per cent of all child workers, accor-
ding to the UN. They want the UN to
“make a distinction between exploitation of
children and other forms of work which
help their development.”
In fact the ILO conventions are beco-
ming more fle x i b l e . The first one, w h i c h
dates from 1919, set the minimum age for
factory work at 14. But the main interna-
tional legal instrument is Convention 138,
signed in 1973. This fixes the minimum
age at 15 (or at the end of compulsory edu-
cation) and makes many exceptions.
Punishable crimes
But most developing countries think
this is too strict and only about 20 of
them have rat i fied it. A more widely
accepted version is currently being nego-
tiated in the ILO and is due to be adop-
ted in June 1999 in Geneva.This one will
deal only with the most inhuman and
dangerous categories of labour, like slave-
ry, prostitution, drug trafficking and work
harmful to health.
For the Nats, these activities should
not be regarded as work but as punishable
crimes. Their existence, they say, should
not be an excuse to throw the baby (a
child’s right to work) out with the bath
water (the inhuman tasks they are some-
times forced to do).What’s more, accor-
ding to Michel Bonnet, a former ILO offi-
cial who has written a book called Le
Travail des enfants:ter rain des luttes (“Child
Labour: A Battleground”)1 only 10 per
cent of Nats live in intolerable conditions,
mostly in Asia.
At big conferences, complains Dibou
Faye, a 14-year-old maid from Senegal,
“adults speak for us. They say that if chil-
dren work, they’re no longer children.
When I was seven,I would’ve preferred to
go to school. But as my parents didn’t
have the money to send me, I decided to
work instead.” Since the maids in Dakar
have organized themselves, and march in
the annual May Day procession alongside
trade unionists, their working conditions
have slightly improved.
“When one of them is beaten or wron-
gly accused of something, she can count
on the support of others and can lodge a
complaint. Before, the police wouldn’t
e ven listen,” s ays Hamidou Coly, o f
ENDA, an NGO that supports Nats in
West Africa. ENDA provides the children
with an education geared to their situa-
tion (in the evenings and with the content
worked out with the students), legal aid
and help in negotiating cheaper medicine
and hospital care.
“In Africa,” says Coly, “the minimum
legal age for starting work is usually 15.
Education is compulsory and supposedly
free up to the age of 12. But even if they
go to school until then, what are kids
going to do between 12 and 15?”
N ats are being helped by organizations like
E N DA in A f ri c a , MANTHOC in Pe ru and
C o n c e rned for Working Children in India.
This does not rule out “the risk of being
m a n i p u l at e d ” , s ays Bonnet, who nonethe-
less welcomes the emergence of the Nat s.
“They want to be respected, get a
decent wa g e , h ave work breaks, a n d
access to education and health care.What
they don’t want is to wake up and find in
their district some ill-thought-out project
from a rich country which is going to lose
them their job.”
Duncan Green, a British worker with
the Catholic Aid A g e n cy, who spent seve-
ral months last year with the Nats in Lat i n
A m e ri c a , laments that “most [We s t e rn ]
adults think child wo r k e rs in the T h i r d
World are the equivalents of the little boy s
used as forced labour in British fa c t o ries in
V i c t o rian times.” Not so, he say s.“ Wo r k i n g
gi ves them self-confid e n c e , k n ow - h ow and
money to feed themselve s.”
UNICEF and the ILO have been for-
ced to recognize this. “The lesson of 1994
has been digested,” Leroy says.That year,
the owners of textile mills in Bangladesh
sacked 50,000 child workers after a bill
was put before the U.S. Congress to ban
the import of clothing made by child wor-
kers. Some of the children thrown out of
work were forced to go begging or beco-
me prostitutes.
Accepting that working in a factory is
better than being on the street, UN agen-
cies set up a programme enabling some of
the children to be rehired and also have
access to education and health care on the
job. Brutal solutions should be avoided,
says Saintgeorge, “but we can’t legalize
child labour. If we do, we’ll have no way
of controlling it in many countries.”
Minimum standards
The UN recognizes it is unrealistic
and dangerous to want to abolish child
labour. Developing countries, often for-
ced to cut social spending, do not have
the resources to provide education for all
and social security coverage for poor chil-
dren. But the UN continues to campaign
for abolition. UNICEF “is strongly
urging the World Trade Organisation to
adopt a ‘social clause’,” which wo u l d
require minimum standards from compa-
nies, including a ban on child labour.
This ambiguous position illustrat e s
the complexity of the problem. “Whether
they work or not,poor children are at risk.
You just have to know which risks are the
worst,” says Bonnet. n

E T H I C S
Young Peruvians set up a
pioneering movement for
working children and
t e e n a g e rs
nThey’re called “Nats”, the acronym of
Niños y Adolescentes Trabajadores—Child
and Teenage Wo r k e rs. The term mainly
r e f e rs to needy children in towns and cities,
although there are more child wo r k e rs in the
countryside. Poverty, unemployment and
family problems, including violence, have
pushed them onto the streets. Often it isn’t
possible—or even desirable—for them to
r e t u rn home to their parents. They fre-
quently work in very harsh conditions and
are exploited and mistreated.
The Intern ational Labour Organisat i o n
reckons there are 17.5 million child wo r k e rs
in Latin A m e ri c a , but some NGOs say there
are between 25 and 30 million, including
1.5 to 2 million in Pe ru .The United Nat i o n s
has criticized Pe ru for being the only
country in Latin America to legally allow
children to work from the age of 12, i n s t e a d
of 14 as elsewhere.
The Nats in Lima, Peru’s capital, were
the first children in the world to organize
t h e m s e l ves in a social move m e n t . In the
early 1970s, m e m b e rs of the Christian Wo r-
kers Youth Movement opened centres for
street children in the city’s poorest neigh-
b o u r h o o d s. Most of the centres looked after
children who earned a living doing odd
jobs in open-air markets.
A national charter
But when Lima city council threat e n e d
in 1976 to sell the land on which the street
c h i l d r e n ’s centres stood, there was an outcry.
In the southern part of the city, the children,
their parents, grandparents and others got
together to defend the centres. They also
demanded that the centres be connected to
water,electricity and sewage services.The
children and teenagers called for access to
school places and health care.
The protests brought the children’s
centres together into a loose netwo r k , a n d
gradually the movement took shape. Its sup-
p o rt e rs developed the idea of “ p r o t a g o-
n i s m ” ,i .e.considering children as respon-
sible people, defending their right to wo r k ,
and believing in their ability to act for them-
s e l ve s , organize and generally improve their
own situation.
The Movement of Working Children of
Christian Workers (MANTHOC) was set
up in Lima in 1978.“Our aim was to streng-
then a movement established by and for
children and geared to their specific needs,”
s ays Nelly To rr e s , the founder of MAN-
THOC. “We wanted them to share their
e x p e riences with the majority of street chil-
dren, who weren’t organized.”The move-
ment slowly spread to other tow n s , e ve n
though it still only invo l ved a ve ry small
number of Nats.
TodayTorres runs the National Move-
ment of Peruvian Young Workers’ Organi-
z ations (MNNAT S O P ) , a federation set
up in 1996 representing nearly 10,000 chil-
dren between 7 and 14 living in 18 towns all
over the country. It has drawn up a nat i o n a l
charter for the rights of Nats. Its members
point out that because the school dropout
r ate is ve ry high, children are better off
working rather than hanging about the
streets all day long. A job can even help
keep their families together by providing
extra income.
M N N ATSOP believes that the essential
thing is for the Nats to earn respect, and
encourages them to associate in produc-
tion workshops to demand better working
c o n d i t i o n s. A credit system has been set
up to enable the most vulnerable Nats to
reduce their working hours so they can
study or enjoy themselves.
MNNATSOP considers it very impor-
tant to develop good relations with the
a u t h o ri t i e s. Last ye a r , it scored a success by
signing an agreement with the Lima city
g ove rn m e n t , which promised to create 600
jobs for Nats over the next two ye a rs. N e g o-
t i ations to win social security rights are also
going on, though so far without success.
However,a number of ad hoc agreements
h ave been signed with hospitals and clinics
which have agreed to provide child wo r-
kers with free medical care.
More progress seems to have been made
on the educational front, thanks to efforts by
NGOs and by the gove rn m e n t . M A N-
THOC opened the first school for Nats in
1986 in a south Lima neighbourhood. It wa s
geared to child wo r k e rs ’h o u rs and interests.
In 1996,the ministry of education started
special programmes for Nats in 9 of the
capital’s primary schools.
M N N ATSOP also has a scheme to pro-
tect young wo r k e rs called Colibri , which is
run by the national police force. “ We try to
protect street children from delinquents,
but also from abuse by city officials who
m i g h t , for example, seize the wares of unau-
t h o rized child ve n d o rs ,” s ays Col. Luis Her-
mosa Ortega.
“I ran away from home because my
dad’s new wife beat me,” says Pablo Ortiz
V i c u ñ a , a 12-year-old being looked after
by Colibri offic i a l s.“ N ow I live at the house
of a friend who washes cars like me. S o m e-
times I go begging but only when I don’t
have anything to eat.” n

The 144 employees of the T i m buktu air-
p o rt wrote to complain about their wo r k
c o n d i t i o n s.They were not receiving their
s a l a ries on time, back pay was due and paid
va c ations were going uncompensat e d .T h e y
d i d n ’t have the funds necessary to travel along
d e s e rt and mountain roads down to the capital,
B a m a k o, in order to present their complaint in
the fle s h .N o n e t h e l e s s ,M a l i ’s minister of jus-
t i c e ,D i a b até Hamidou, duly read their letter.
Cheick Coulibaly,a former sergeant in the
Malian army, raised a gri e vance dating back
to 1968, 8 ye a rs after the West A f rican country
gained independence from France.M r.C o u-
libaly wanted financial restitution for the five
ye a rs he spent doing hard labour during the
p e riod when he was politically at loggerheads
with the gove rn m e n t .Dressed in a traditional
long gown called a bu bu , with a white hat ,h e
read his letter directly to the gove rn m e n t .
M r. Coulibaly and the airp o rt employe e s
were among the 40 individuals and groups to
avail themselves in December 1998 of the
annual EID, Espace d’Interp e l l ation Démo-
c r atique (Democratic Question T i m e ) , a five -
year old institution that forms a bridge bet-
ween tradition and modern - d ay need for
finding direct solutions to problems that stat e
institutions have n ’t resolved conclusive l y.
D u ring turbulent times, A f rican chiefs
would often gather tribe members to talk
about problems, and thus hopefully preve n t
u n r e s t . In practice though, these gat h e ri n g s
were often tense and could erupt into vio-
l e n c e .When President Alpha Oumar Konaré
assumed power in 1992, he picked up the
tradition of consulting with his subjects by
holding open house on Fri d ays when people
could come to set forth their problems to the
g ove rn m e n t . It is thought that EID was the
n atural offspring of these meetings, w h i c h ,i n
contrast with the tribal gat h e rings of ye s t e rye a r ,
were always peaceful and  sometimes helped
the new president shape his gove rn m e n t a l
p o l i cy.
To d ay, once a year all Malian citizens are
i nvited to present their complaints before
p rime minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and
his entire cabinet. For ordinary Malians, i t ’s
their one big chance to make sure their vo i c e s
are heard.
Because only one out of eve ry five adult
Malians can read, a d ve rtisements for the EID
are not only run in newspapers but also on
radio and T V.Ads are in all 13 of the country ’s
o f ficial languages and in 1998 269 people
sent letters with their complaints.The relat i-
vely low letter response may be due in part to
the fact that a trip to Bamako is too expensive
for any but the richest Malian to contem-
p l at e .Another factor hindering part i c i p at i o n
a p p e a rs to be that many ve ry poor, i l l i t e r at e
Malians have no access to letter-wri t e rs.
M o r e ove r , despite new roads,more electri c i t y
and other positive signs since the change in
g ove rnment early this decade, m a ny poorer
p a rts of the country have hardly been touched
by Konaré’s administration and thus may be
sceptical as to whether any contact at all with
the gove rnment might be of use.
A 15-hour session
The complaints at the most recent EID ran
a gamut of problems, from birth control to
rights for the elderly. A young man had
endured deplorable prison conditions;a fat h e r
of four couldn’t afford the U.S.$15 per child
required for school enrollment; a medical stu-
d e n t ,while on a scholarship in Prague,was for-
gotten by his country and left to fight for his
life with skinheads;victims of traffic accidents
wondered if the roads would ever be safe; a
man was fired due to a sexual harassment
charge filed by a visiting A m e ri c a n ; h a n d i-
capped persons hoped that bu i l d e rs wo u l d
one day take their needs into account; firs t
w i ves spoke about rights granted to others
(up to four wives are allowed in this mainly
Muslim country ) . Almost eve ry sector of
g ove rnment was addressed.
Although complaints are limited to five
minutes each,e ve ry year EID goes on long into
the night and is broadcast live on ORT M ,
the country ’s only television stat i o n .The 1998
EID lasted 15 hours.R i n ging mobile phones,
o u t bu rsts of cheers and jeers and interm i s s i o n s
with songs and skits help keep spectat o rs
awa k e . Most interventions are voiced in
F r e n c h ,but because the option to speak in any
of the 13 languages is offered,some of the most
emotional pleas are voiced in the country ’s
most widespread language, B a m b a r a .
After all complaints were heard,g ove rn-
ment officials filed to the front of the Chines e -
built Hall of Congress to present their res-
p o n s e s.Unlike the many citizens who came in
colourful bu bu s , and were often barefoot,
Once a year all Malians get

most male ministers stuck to European-style
u n i f o rms of grey suits and ties.The two female
m i n i s t e rs (in the domains of communicat i o n
and the family) turned up in traditional
colourful dresses. One by one the ministers
responded to the complaints addressed to
their sector of gove rn m e n t .The gove rn m e n t
promised former Sergeant Coulibaly that it
would look into the request for compensat i o n
for his period of forced labour.
Each minister had received a copy of the
l e t t e rs addressing their sector well before the
EID began, and their responses frequently
sounded perfunctory.Often laws were invo k e d
and details cited that only a legal expert could
f o l l ow.But responses were officially recorded
and it is possible to review them in the year fol-
l owing the EID.
After reviewing the promises made by
the ministers at the 1997 EID and at the pro-
gress made in handling them six months
l at e r , last ye a r ’s honorary jury felt sat i s fied that
o f ficials were paying more than lip service to
E I D. The 1997 jury had made 12 recom-
m e n d at i o n s , including changes to inheri t a n c e
l aws to benefit wo m e n .EID seems to have had
at least an indirect impact on effecting change
in several instances. For example, the gove rn-
ment has committed itself to legal and other
steps aimed at doing away with excision, o n
the heels of complaints at previous EIDs
about female genital mutilat i o n . At a more
p e rsonal leve l , m a ny individuals who com-
plained about lack of electricity have had
their demands met. At an even more basic
l e ve l , a man who complained earlier that his
radio had been stolen had the object return e d
to him.

to attend the EID which they joke stands for

plaints are invited to Bamako and that most
m i n i s t e rial promises are not kept.This often
happens because of lack of money—Mali is
one of the wo r l d ’s poorest countri e s. For the
o p p o s i t io n , the EID is an expensive public
r e l ations ploy used to hide alleged gove rn-
mental corruption and attract outside approva l
to the gove rnment (foreign assistance accounts
for 20 per cent of Mali’s national bu d g e t . )
The letter from the 144 T i m buktu airp o rt

EID with the same complaint.

n
In the early 17th century, a Po rt u g u e s e
Catholic missionary, Father Mariano,
made strenuous efforts to convert the
people of the small kingdom of Sahadia, o n
the west coast of Madagascar, n o rth of
modern-day Morondava. Despite lengthy
expeditions to the area, h owe ve r , he did
not succeed.
One of the main reasons for his fa i l u r e ,
he noted in a letter, was the kingdom’s poli-
tical system.“If the king at least had some
a u t h o ri t y,” he wrote,“ we could have hoped
for some success. But the king only controls
the area around his home town,he is poor
and not feared,and his subjects do as they
please without his daring to complain. In
fa c t , the people form a kind of republic.
Whenever a big local issue comes up, eve-
ryone gathers to discuss it in a council.”
Father Mariano was talking about the
fo k o n o l o n a, an ancient tradition which has to
some extent surv i ved in Madagascar to this
d ay (see the UN E S C O C o u ri e r, March 1999).
But it is also found elsewhere in A f ri c a ,
where it is known as the palaver.
A key socio-political institution of pre-
colonial Africa, the palaver is an assembly
where a variety of issues are freely debated
and important decisions concerning the
community are taken. Its purpose is to
r e s o l ve latent and ove rt conflicts in cert a i n
highly specific situations.The participants
usually gather under a “ p a l aver tree” w h e r e
e ve ryone has the right to speak and air their
gri e vances or those of their gr o u p. A
complainant may opt to be represented by
The palaver is a traditional African institution 
of debate and consensus whose democratic potential 
has been overshadowed by modern political systems
a griot (a poet, storyteller and traditional
singer), or some other spokesman.
The status of women in these assem-
b l i e s , where the elders try to reach a
c o n s e n s u s , va ries from region to regi o n .
Among some peoples, women actively take
p a rt in the decision-making.Among others ,
they settle for advising their menfolk outside
the assemblies.
One form of the palaver is the
Ethiopian d e b o, a mutual aid system
where the men of the community get
together to help a neighbour (the aba
debo, “father of the debo”) carry out a
major task. The group chooses a leader,
who in turn designates a walle to do the
talking. He has to be eloquent and have a
good voice because his job is to lead the
singing while the work is being done and
provide words of encouragement in parti-
cularly arduous moments. He also
defends the interests of the workers befo-
re the aba debo and reports back to them.
Wider participation
by women
Pa l ave rs operate in va rious way s ,e . g .t o
d e l i b e r ate about a marriage or a sale, s e t t l e
a dispute, look at the circumstances of a
c rime and then decide how to find and
punish the culpri t . But the underlying pri n-
ciple does not change. This is one of the
d e m o c r atic institutions of traditional A f ri c a n
societies which many African intellectuals
feel could be used in the transition to a
m o d e rn political system, as long as it opens
itself up more to women.
In his autobiogr a p hy, Long Walk to
Freedom, South African President Nelson
Mandela stresses the part these assemblies
p l ayed in his political career. “My lat e r
notions of leaders h i p,” he wri t e s , “ we r e
profoundly influenced by observing the
regent and his court . I watched and learn e d
from the tribal meetings that were regularly
held at the Great Place.. . . Everyone who
wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in
its purest form .There may have been a hie-
rarchy of importance among the speakers,
but everyone was heard. . . . As a leader, I
have always followed the principles I first
s aw demonstrated by the regent at the Great
Place.”
However, such institutions are usually
dismissed by A f rican politicians as old-
fa s h i o n e d .A f rican leaders “tend to distru s t
the palaver and prefer a superficial legal
s t ructure imported directly from the We s t ,”
s ays Cameroonian philosopher Je a n - G o d e-
froy Bidima.
Since political independence in the
1 9 6 0 s , young A f rican elites trained in
“ w h i t e ”We s t e rn ways have encouraged the
adoption of We s t e rn models, including legal
codes which are largely unsuited to A f ri c a n
conditions. Even today, rural Africans find
it ve ry hard to accept that a “ c u s t o m ”f r o m
outside can override sacred customs inhe-
rited from their ancestors.
“This is why bush people don’t bring
their grievances to the courts (which only
exist in the capital) and prefer to settle their
differences using traditional stru c t u r e s ,”
s ays Ethiopian scholar Béseat Kiflé
S é l a s s i é1. “So-called modern institutions
in Africa are like make-up on an old lady’s
face: it only beautifies the surface.It’s like
t rying to modernize a building by cleaning
up the façade and doing nothing to renovat e
the inside.”
And so in Africa where, as the Malian
scholar Hampaté Bâ once said,“different
worlds, different mentalities and different
eras are superimposed on each other,” the
p a l aver is “a kind of parallel authori t y.”
Mali is the only A f rican country where it has
been integrated into the modern political
system. n

Soaps with

C O N N E X I O N S
n
D u ring Ramadan last Ja n u a ry, s o m e
of the mosques in Abidjan decided to
b ring forward prayer time. T h i s
thoughtful gesture saved thousands of the
faithful from a painful dilemma—whether
to do their religious duty or miss the latest
episode of Marimar, a Mexican TV melo-
drama which has turned the whole country
into addicts of t e l e n ove l a s, soap operas made
in Latin America.
“At 7.30 sharp in the eve n i n g, w h e n
M a ri m a r comes on, e ve rything stops in
Côte d’Ivo i r e ,” the evening newspaper
I vo i r ’ S o i r noted a few months ago. T h e
p r o gr a m m e , which has attracted more local
fans than the 1998 World Cup, arrived in
A f rica after being a similar hit in Indonesia
and the Philippines. In 1997, its female star
was received in Manila like a foreign head
of state.
M e a n w h i l e , on the other side of the
p l a n e t , hundreds of thousands of Yu g o s l av s
hold their breath so as not to miss the tiniest
detail of the Venezuelan soap opera Kas-
s a n d ra. “ We know Kassandra’s innocent
and we want her trial stopped,” the towns-
people of Kucevo, in southeastern Serbia,
wrote to the Venezuelan government, with
a copy to Serbian President Slobodan Milo-
sevic.This is just one of many examples of
h ow fiction can invade real life and how
far people come to identify with it.
M a ri m a r and K a s s a n d ra are classics
among the thousands of soap operas Latin
America has turned out over the past 40
years at the rate of about 100 a year.They
are love stories which have plenty of sub-
plots and move along at a brisk pace.T h e i r
c h a r a c t e rs overcome countless obstacles—
social class, family ties, c o n flicts of interest
and so on—to finally win through despite all
the ambushes of fat e . In all of them, m o r a-
lity and goodness triumph and the bad guys
get punished in a happy ending where eve-
ryone is reconciled. In this respect they are
ve ry different from Anglo-Saxon soap
Actress Patricia Pillar, heroine of the Brazilian
soap opera Rei do Gado (“The Cattle King”).
C h a rged with suspense and fantasy, Latin American soap operas are pouring 
off the production lines into living rooms all over the world

operas,in which conflicts get solved in the
c o u rse of a few virtually self-contained epi-
sodes, which means they can be broadcast
in any order.
The plot of a Latin American telenovela
includes a strong dose of suspense. Each
episode has a dramatic ending to make sure
v i e we rs watch the next one.This tactic pro-
duced a new way of making some pocket
money when Kassandra was shown in the
B a l k a n s. People in Bulgari a ,where the soap
was running 10 episodes ahead of Yu g o-
slavTV, would tell their neighbours across
the border what was coming up next—in
exchange for 10 dinars ($2).
The worldwide success of these soaps
suggests they might be something more
than just a carefully-engineered collection
of dirty deeds and superficial emotions.
Their hackneyed themes don’t often
amount to anything of great artistic value,
but the scripts aren’t always puerile and
the dialogue and characters are less pre-
dictable than one might expect. Telenovelas
have accumulated 40 years of experience
and professionalism and turned into an
i n d u s t ry which can buy the best actors ,
s c ri p t w ri t e rs and directors in Latin A m e ri c a .
Urban violence and political
corruption
Since the 1970s, p r o d u c e rs have also
tried to go beyond classic melodrama and
h ave adapted the works of wri t e rs like Mari o
B e n e d e t t i , M a rio Vargas Llosa and Jo r g e
Amado. In recent years,authors,directors
and scri p t w ri t e rs in the Latin A m e ri c a n
film industry have brought new life to the
genre by broadening its range of subjects
and bri n ging it closer to real life. T h e s e
“ n e w - wave ” t e l e n ove l a s dig straight into
issues like police corru p t i o n , i n f l u e n c e -
p e d d l i n g, urban violence, impunity and the
role of mafia money,as in last ye a r ’s Colom-
bian production La Mujer del presidente
(“The President’s Wife”) and, the ye a r
b e f o r e , Nada pers o n a l (“Nothing Pe rs o n a l ” ) ,
which was made in Mexico.
Soaps like this have sparked off social
d e velopments which in the past would have
been unthinkable.Ve n e z u e l a ’s Por estas calles
(“Through These Streets”), screened in
1 9 9 2 , was about the decline of a corrupt and
p owerful ru l e r , who reminded many vie-
we rs of President Carlos Andrés Pérez, t h e
c o u n t ry ’s president at the time. A n d r é s
Pérez was caught up in a corruption scandal
which drove him from office two ye a rs lat e r
“because of this soap among other rea-
sons,” says its producer,Alberto Giarroco.
In Brazil, O Salvador da Pat ri a ( “ S aviour of
the Fat h e r l a n d ” ; 1989) was accused, o n
the other hand, of favouring the presiden-
tial campaign of Inácio Lula Da Silva ,s i n c e
it closely mirrored his life story as a half-lite-
r ate peasant who rose to be a powerful trade
union leader and presidential candidat e .
“Lula”,however, was not elected.
A multi-million-dollar 
industry
This new trend, which is very popular
with Latin American audiences,shows the
vitality of the soap tradition, which can
affect politicians and adapt to curr e n t
e ve n t s. The t e l e n ove l a, s ays Colombian
s c ri p t w riter Fe rnando Gaitán, has become
“the continent’s main channel of commu-
n i c at i o n ,d r awing larger audiences than the
cinema, novels or the theatre.” But as well
as being a firmly-established regional craze
which has now spread all over the world,it
is also a multi-million-dollar industry.The
biggest production companies—in Brazil,
Mexico and Venezuela—present their wo r k
A world m a r ke t
“Although selling telenovelas on the inter-
national market is a major cultural
i n d u s t r y, its economics are less important than its
cultural impact,” says researcher Daniel Mato,
of Ve n e z u e l a ’s Central University. “ They’re pri-
marily produced for the home marke t , where it is
hoped returns will recoup production costs.”
Mato found that advertising during soaps was the
main source of income for TV stations, while ear-
nings from foreign sales were only a tiny per-
centage of the income from advertising in the
home market (8 per cent in the case of Radio
Caracas Televisión and Ve n e v i s i ó n , in Ve n e z u e l a ,
5 per cent for Televisa de México and 2.5 per
cent for Brazil’s TV Globo).
Income from foreign sales per episode is much
less than the cost of production, which runs at
between $15,000 and $100,000, and only comes
in after the soap has become a success at home and
sometimes only many years later. A l s o, the sale
price varies from country to country, according to
the number of TV sets per head, p e o p l e ’s purcha-
sing power and especially the amount spent on
a d v e r t i s i n g . Last year, says Mato, the price of soap
operas sold abroad ranged from $7,000 to $9,000
per hour of air time in Spain, $2,550 to $5,000 for
Hispanic stations in the U. S. and between $1,200
and $1,500 in Hong Ko n g .This compares with the
U. S. soap D y n a s t y,which sells for $20,000 an epi-
sode to British stations, $1,500 to Norwegian ones
and for only $50 to Zambian and Syrian televi-
s i o n .
Mato admits that despite being economi-
cally just icing on the cake, “the soaps that Tele-
visa de México sold abroad in 1997, for example,
earned about $100 million,” only a little less than
the BBC earned from selling its own programmes,
and a respectable figure next to the $500 million
earned from such sales by each of the transna-
tional TV giants Warner Brothers, Paramount and
Universal.
The advance of globalization has boosted
worldwide distribution of soaps and opened up
new markets in Asia and the Middle East. T V
Globo says the economic crisis in Asia has gene-
rally increased demand there because imported
goods are cheaper than home-made productions.
But the field is increasingly competitive. C o u n-
tries which until now were just importers, l i ke
S p a i n , G r e e c e, Tu r key and the Philippines, a r e
starting to turn out their own soaps and challen-
ging Latin A m e r i c a ’s hold on the marke t . To hang
on to their position, the Latin American firms are
looking for new partners. Currently in the works,
for example, is a co-production by China and
Brazil about a young Chinese man who falls in
love with a Brazilian girl and goes to Brazil to woo
h e r.And so begins another episode in the history

at international television trade fairs and

which distribute their products over two-
thirds of the globe (see box).
Prime time 
productions
Brazil’s TV Globo is perhaps the most
typical of these firms and has sold teleno-
velas to 123 countries, according to its
i n t e rn ational sales director, O r l a n d o
Marques. The TV Globo telenovelas are
screened from six in the evening on and
their 160 or so episodes cost between
$50,000 and $60,000 each to make. The
local viewing audience is around 80 mil-
lion people. A 30-second pri m e - t i m e
advertising spot when the soaps are on
the air costs $60,000 or so.TV Globo has
four recording studios and a script-wri-
ting staff of about 1,500.While the soap is
showing, polls and discussion groups are
held in several cities to gather viewers’
opinions and suggestions. Telenovelas were
responsible for almost $1.6 billion in
billings for 1996, 60 per cent of Brazilian
TV’s ad billings. “Without telenovelas, TV
Globo might not exist,” says Jorge Adib,
the company’s former international sales
director. This is true of Latin American
television overall.The soap opera industry
has helped train professionals and highly
specialized technicians, while also encou-
raging the emergence of a Latin American
star system.
L atin A m e rican soaps really took off
worldwide in the 1980s when, after conque-
ring the European market, they began to
interest A r a b ,A f rican and Asian countri e s.
N ow they are as much a symbol of Lat i n
A m e rica as salsa and football. Some are tre-
mendous hits, like the Brazilian soap E s c l ava
I s a u ra in countries as different as China
(where it was shown for the first time in
1980 in Mandari n , and again in 1983),
Poland and Cuba. O t h e rs , like Ve n e z u e l a ’s
C ri s t a l, which has been shown seven times in
S p a i n ,n e ver seem to lose their populari t y. L o s
Ricos También Llora n (“The Rich Cry To o ” ) ,
a Mexican production, p r oved a real tear-
jerker in Russia, where two-thirds of Mos-
c ow ’s impove rished inhabitants saw that
money doesn’t always buy happiness.To p a c i o
( “ To p a z ” ) , from Ve n e z u e l a , has been sold
to 45 countri e s.
What’s the secret of their success? Do
gr owing demand and low production costs
explain their extraordinarily wide distri bu-
tion? Or is it, as some believe ,t h at Latin exo-
ticism and emotional exuberance draw the
viewers? “It’s a fact that stories with lots of
local colour, showing typical Latin Ame-
rican scenes and people,are most popular
in the rest of the wo r l d ,” s ays researcher
Daniel Mato.

TV soaps are popular “because they

with these tales. They prefer them to the
French ones which they find too intellec-

you trace your political awakening

a first-class education.

Allen goes on. “When the two get to
London, the IQ there doubles overnight.”
Smaller round of applause. “I thought we
agreed that you’re supposed to be able to
laugh at yourself.”
This catches the audience completely
u n aware of their own bigotry. T h at ’s the
eye of the outsider.
Your brand of stand-up comedy seems to
mean getting up on a soap box to
denounce wrong-doing. Why?
My tour manager always used to say,
“ I t ’s in the genes, m at e .”You see my dad wa s
a lay preacher and my gr e at gr a n d fat h e r
was a Baptist preacher which I think is
funny. I’ll start to worry about it if my son
decides to be a stand-up.
Seriously, do you have to focus on political
issues in your work?
Every single thing that anyone says on
stage belies their world view. It’s a political
decision to believe that people just want a
good night out without having to think.
The person on stage who tells jokes por-
t r aying women in a certain way has made a
political decision to reinforce stereotypes
instead of challenging people to think other-
wise.That performer is saying,“I want the
easiest ride possible. I want mass adula-
tion on the back of you (the audience) not
having to think.” The difference is that I
want mass adulation on the back of people
having to think.
How do you design a TV comedy show to
make people think?
We look at the series as our own “state
of the nation”broadcast.It’s our interpre-
t ation of where Britain is and where we are
in relationship to the world.
We try to get in a position where we
can ask questions that will illuminate the
n ature of power in that situat i o n .With Sel-
l a field nuclear processing plant, the firs t
thing we did was to prove contamination

plant’s nuclear waste? Or is there a wider
problem? Is the site irr a d i at e d ? ”The autho-
rities wo n ’t answe r. This is a bri l l i a n t
s i t u ation in which we really get undern e at h
the mask of public relations.The officials’
silence actually says that they’re fri g h t e n e d
of the answer.
In the last three years, you’ve evolved from
merry prankster to political satirist and
now you’re an information junky. What
happened? 
In the begi n n i n g, the show was about us
taking ri s k s — t u rning up at a cabinet minis-
t e r ’s home at a quarter to seven in the mor-
ning in a tank asking if he could help us
e x p o rt it to Iraq. Or turning up in Yo r k-
shire during a drought with a tanker filled
with water as a “ gift from the people of
E t h i o p i a ” after Britain pri vatized the wat e r
wo r k s.We were drawing out the stupidity of
the situation.
But the next year, we wanted to refine
the show.There were bits which I was very
proud of but it wasn’t mature or rigorous
e n o u g h .There wa s n ’t enough inform at i o n .
So in the second year, we really wanted to
be factually accurat e .N ow in this last ye a r ,
we wanted to go a step further and do sto-
ries that people have n ’t heard about
elsewhere. So we’ve ended up being acci-
dental journ a l i s t s.We didn’t intend for this
to happen. But now that it has, we quite like
i t . Do bad for good—that ’s basically the
ethos of the show.
Nine times out of ten,I think the most
i m p o rtant thing is to actually ask the ques-
tion and get it into the public domain.
Noam Chomsky, A m e rican linguist and
a c t i v i s t ,d e s c ribed it ve ry succinctly when he
said that the media reflect the dominant
interests in the political climate. . . . Who
owns the media? What are their interests?
W h at are the interests of the ruling elite
t h at they’re working with? How are they
setting the political agenda? Look at any
television programme that deals with sup-
posedly serious political news and yo u ’ l l
find interviews with gove rnment spokesmen
or women on an initiat i ve or piece of legi s-
l ation that they’ve creat e d . M aybe they’ll
address an issue the gove rnment is being
attacked about. But nearly all the interv i e w s
will be done with politicians, in studios with
r e p o rt e rs who have to come back to those
same officials the next week for more news.
If they decide to actually question the
relationships of power instead of focusing
just on the intricacies of elite policy, then
t h e y ’re quite often going to run into trouble.
But in staging the event, aren’t you
sacrificing objective and balanced
reporting?
If you take the ideas of objectivity,
balance and impartiality to their logical
May 1999 - The UNESCO Courier 47
“It’s like brain surgery with a hammer,” a
producer once said when describing Mark
Thomas’ television show, a mix of filmed
stunts and improvisation before a studio
audience. Recent highlights include:
m Menwith Hill Military Base
This sprawling complex of what looks like
giant golf-balls has been reported by British
broadsheet newspapers as the world’s largest
electronic monitoring station.It is owned by
the British defence ministry but reportedly
operated by the U.S. National Security Agency.
Since 1996,members of parliament and
concerned citizens have raised questions about
activities at the base. Officials, citing security
reasons, have been tight-lipped.Access to the
base is limited to officials with the highest
security clearance. But Thomas discovers that
the air over the base is not restricted.So he
takes a tour in a hot-air balloon and later
invites 500 or so fans for guided visits
scheduled to lift off this July 4th.
m British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL)
Local residents call Thomas when they find
trains used to transport radioactive waste from
the nearby Sellafield nuclear processing plant
(owned by BNFL) parked too close to home for
comfort. Thomas decides to investigate.
As a conductor leaves the train to open a
gate at a level crossing, Thomas and 40
camouflaged friends pull up in armoured cars
and a helicopter as “the People’s Nuclear Train
Militia”pledging to protect the train from
terrorist attack.
Next,the team don white suites to collect
samples of earth along the tracks surrounding
Sellafield which are analysed by a scientist at
the University of Manchester who finds traces
of radioactive materials. BNFL officials refuse
to meet with Thomas, who they maintain has
“trivialized”a serious subject. Thomas
launches a “telephonathon”,with journalists
and members of parliament barraging BNFL
with questions, essentially asking if the alleged
contamination is due to leaky containers in the
trains or wider problems with the nuclear
plant.In a letter, BNFL maintains that all
operations are carried out in strict accordance
with UK and international standards.
m Defendory International
Thomas and team set up a stand at this major
arms fair held in Greece under the guise of a
public relations firm with the theme: “Are you
ready when Amnesty International comes
knocking on your door?”As various high-
ranking officials visit the stand, Thomas
videotapes their discussions to offer an
unusual look at the men behind the arms
trade. A man who identifies himself on tape as

The making of a TV t ro u b l e - m a ke r
48 The UNESCO Courier - May 1999
T A L K I N G  T O …
conclusion, then I believe you should
have the right to reply to every single
advertisement. Every time an advert by
petroleum companies like Shell or Esso
comes on television, then one and a half
minutes should be reserved for someone
from the public to say what they think
about those companies and their environ-
mental records.
The idea of objectivity doesn’t exist in
media—just the veneer of it. One of the
gr e atest quotes came from the British fil m -
maker Ken Loach over a film he did about
union bosses and how often they betray
the wo r k e rs.There was a big row about this
film, with critics saying “You’ve got to be
i m p a rt i a l ” and the union bosses say i n g,
“ We demand the right to reply.” Ken Loach
turned and said,“I am the right to reply.”
In most of the media, impartiality just
means not being too critical of the preva l e n t
ruling class perspective.
So your priority lies in being factually
correct.Impartiality is not a concern? 
We are the balance. I don’t know many
people who have done television pro-
grammes about the pri vat i z ation of the
national healthcare system aside from iso-
lated reports. On the case of the American
n Even the briefest sketch of Mark Thomas would
not be complete without a parenthetical guide
for those readers unfamiliar with the linguistic
subtleties of south London.
In short, Thomas discovers his first love—
stand-up comedy—at the age of 12 and begins to
produce and star in his own school productions.B u t
j o ke-telling veers towards trouble-making as
Thomas assumes the role of the herbert (slang for
a rebel without a cause, prone to drinking) when
he wins a scholarship as part of the “ d e s e r v i n g
p o o r ” to study at an elite school in Sussex.The snub
of upper class students is partially offset by the
wisdom of a drama teacher who helps to transform
t h e herbert into half a r t y - b o y (drama student
convinced of his god-given talent) by exposing
him to the works of Bertolt Brecht.
At Bretton Hall drama college,Thomas takes an
extracurricular course in political realism with the
miners’ strike of 1984-85. L i ke many of his genera-
t i o n , he is shocked into activism by the violence
and emotion of the strike, dividing his time bet-
ween picket lines and benefit shows for the Labour
m o v e m e n t .
After completing his studies, he works with
his father as a painter in London while building
a reputation as a stand-up comedian in clubs
before breaking into radio and television. Th r e e
years ago, he launches his own programme,“ Th e
Mark Thomas Comedy Product”, on Britain’s
Channel 4, a public TV station whose remit
requires it to cater for minority interests unde-
represented by other TV companies. He claims the
title of meeja hor (media whore) meaning
“someone who will do anything to be on the
t e l l y ” . The title is like an ironic wink to the
a u d i e n c e, alluding to the comic’s unease with his
role as “Channel Fo u r ’s pet rebel”.The station has
won a slew of awards for innovative program-
m i n g , b u t , says Th o m a s, the chase for ratings
has also brought a steady flow of imported sit-
c o m s. So when the critics howl, executives point
to Th o m a s.
With rising fame and salary,Thomas has moved
back to his old south London neighbourhood of Cla-
pham with his wife and young son.At the age of
3 5 ,t h e h e r b e r t has found a mission: “do bad for
g o o d ” . n
example, is recorded saying he gets “better at
lying every year”while another man who
identifies himself as the Deputy Commander of
the Kenyan Army says that “wife-beating is a
way of expressing love.”
In a mock workshop on “winning the war
of words” (dealing with the media), Thomas
videotapes a man who identifies himself as an
Indonesian general who admits to the use of
torture. The general was apparently so
impressed by the workshop that he later sent
a colonel from Jakarta to London to meet with
Thomas (incognito) and discuss the possibility
of offering a six-week media training course in
Indonesia. Both officials later deny statements
concerning torture and the use of UK military
equipment to violently quash civilian protests.
m Lie of the land
Under the UK’s Conditionally Exempt Land and
Building Scheme, owners of historic homes are
exempted from paying capital taxes if they offer
public access to their estates. But as Th o m a s
points out, i t ’s impossible to find out where
these homes are because all information
concerning an individual’s tax affairs is
c o n fid e n t i a l . So he launches an investigation in
Oxfordshire to uncover “ p u b l i c ”e s t a t e s, a n d
then traipses through with a bus full of visitors.
On March 3, 1 9 9 9 , the National Audit Offic e
recommended a review of the monitoring
arrangements for exempt estates.
m Do-it-yourself referendum
In the battle to save local hospitals from
closure under a government privatization
scheme, Thomas unearths an obscure parish
council law which obligates local authorities to
pay for and run a referendum on any issue. The
referendum is not binding but, says Thomas,
represents a powerful tool for local
communities to make their voices heard.After
explaining the details of this law on his TV
show, Thomas reports receiving 5,000 calls
within five days from people interested in
organizing their own referenda. The first has
taken place in Wakefield,a town in northern
England where local hospitals face the threat
of privatization.Over 80 per cent of those
people voting flatly rejected all privatization
schemes. The local organizers are now
launching plans for a national movement. n

spy base at Menwith Hill (see box), there
was absolutely no public accountability—
hardly anyone knows that it’s there. We
want the authorities to reply. I t ’s not a ques-
tion of the programme having balance but
the programme having balance in relation
to all the other stuff going around—the PR
c a m p a i g n s ,a d ve rt i s i n g, g ove rnment links to
bu s i n e s s , media collusion and so on.
B e s i d e s , when yo u ’re doing a show on
human rights abuse, for example, I really
don’t see how you can give a torturer the
right to reply.
But maybe the lack of information 
isn’t so much linked to a conspiracy but
simply a consequence of commercializing
news and treating information like
a commodity?
N e w s , especially on television, is a com-
modity packaged into the agenda of those
people (business and political elites) and
their interests. But it shouldn’t be. Infor-
m ation or “ n e w s ” is really about things that
touch your life, t h at shape what you do and
h ave in the wo r l d . You have the right to
improve yourself through access to infor-
m ation—this isn’t an affordable right ava i-
lable to some people but not others.This is
about people’s natural ye a rning to aspire to
a better life and to educate themselve s. A s k
kids what they want to do when they grow
up and they say “Astronaut!”No one says,
“I want to work in a toilet.”
To treat this inform ation as a commodity
is to turn democracy into a joke. If demo-
c r a cy is only about putting a cross on a
ballot paper once eve ry five ye a rs , then it’s
a joke. D e m o c r a cy is not this rigmarole in
which a politician puts on a public relat i o n s
vision on how much you need this person to
be elected. It is not about giving someone
t h at you don’t know a mandate to do what
they wa n t . D e m o c r a cy is about being
i nvo l ved in your community and having the
i n f o rm ation to decide “this is what we wa n t
and this is how we want to get it.”
Some people criticize this view and say
that if you take it to the final degree, you’ll
h ave committees on how to run your street.
I do not have a problem with that.
In your shows, there is always a very clearly
defined “bad guy” or “evil empire.” When
will you turn the spotlight on the
audiences’ own contradictions? The British
government is now recognizing that there
is institutionalized racism in the police
force, for example. Yet people continue to
insist,“We’re not racist.This isn’t our
problem.”
Yo u ’re ve ry right to say that . It is without
a doubt that a majority of people in Bri t a i n ,
at some leve l , are racist. But as a white
man, do I then say, “Right, I’m going to
challenge my own preconceptions on stage.”
I don’t see it as my role as a comedian
to dredge my psyche to bring these things
to the fore. Also if you have a culture of
racism, the lead has to be taken primarily
from the top to stop it. The relat i o n s h i p
b e t ween racism and power is immensely
i m p o rt a n t . So instead of doing a show
a s k i n g, “is my next door neighbour racist?”,
it would be more important to focus on
those people who pretend to be accoun-
table, but aren’t fully accountable.
What do you think of the criticism that the
show attacks the status quo but fails to
offer an alternative?
At the end of about half the show s , we
offer a way of joining in the protest.W h e n
we did the show on the referendum to save
t wo hospitals from pri vat i z ation (see box ) ,
we ended with an offer to help people in
other communities by giving them the
i n f o rm ation to organize their own refe-
r e n d a . F i ve days lat e r , we received 5,000
c a l l s. This isn’t just about challengi n g
a u t h o rity because we have the budget to do
s o — w h i c h , by the way, is ve ry small in
t e rms of television. I t ’s about giving people
i n f o rm at i o n .T h at ’s the starting point for
c h a n g e . As far as I’m concern e d , i t ’s a

‘ D e m o c racy is not this rigmarole in which a politician puts on 
a public relations vision on how much you need this person 
to be elected. It is not about giving someone that you don’t
know a mandate to do what they want. D e m o c racy is about
being involved in your community and having the information to
decide “this is what we want and this is how we want to get it”

major achievement to get people to unders-
tand something like the export credit gua-
rantee scheme* in which the gove rn m e n t
w rites off the debt of va rious regimes to keep
the profitability up of British companies dea-
ling in arm s. People care about issues like
a rms deals, nuclear pollution or A m e rican lis-
tening bases.They want change.
We ’re also say i n g, n e ver get nicked,
n e ver get arr e s t e d . So when we produce a
s h ow, e ve rything is done legally. If I get
a rr e s t e d , I’m a TV mart y r. I ’ ve got Channel
4 (see box) law ye rs backing me up to the
h i l t . But if someone is arr e s t e d , t h e y ’re in
t r o u b l e .T h at ’s not what this show is about.
We are not saying that to get invo l ved yo u
h ave to be “ s p e c i a l ” . For example, we ’r e
going to have between 500 and 1,000
people coming on July 4th for a balloon
tour of the Menwith Hill base. And it’s all
l e g a l .The idea is to get people to join in and
take this protest as far as we can.
Doesn’t this work bring a new set of
responsibilities?
Aaahah! May b e . A lot of people write in
a s k i n g,“can you help?”You think,“Hell! My
heart bleeds but there’s nothing I can do.”
Someone wrote in asking for help to get
t r a f fic lights installed in the neighbourhood.
It’s an absurd world when people have to
w rite to a comic for help. But I think the res-
ponsibilities are to the team and to myself
to keep our integrity.
Do you find yourself becoming self-
righteous?
I’m very aware that I now get paid really
we l l . I’m a perform e r , so I’ve got an ego the
size of London. But the programme is not
just about my gr at i fic at i o n .I t ’s about doing
something of worth. To avoid getting too
self-righteous, we kind of undermine the
p r o gr a m m e ’s wo rth by laughing.We ’re not
hard-nosed journalists. But somewhere in
our wo r k , there is truth or part of the tru t h
or a truth.And that’s important to us. But
at the end of the day, we ’re TV monkeys get-
ting paid.
I don’t think we take ours e l ves too
s e riously but we do get obsessed by the
wo r k .When we did the show about Colonel
Halim Nawi [an Indonesian military at t a c h é
who came to London to consult T h o m a s
who was posing as a PR specialist, see box ] ,
I was absolutely obsessed with all the details
in the sting. After the interv i e w, my wife
asked “ W h at did he admit to?” It was incre-
d i b l e , I said—he admitted to using UK mili-
t a ry equipment, to tort u r e , to the death of
ten students and so on. My wife just sat
there and said,“Those poor fa m i l i e s.”At that
m o m e n t , I realized that in all the details I’d
lost sight of what was really at stake.
How do you get people to care about
issues that may not touch them directly?
Human rights groups invest in major
campaigns with giant posters of maimed
and starving children. But rather than
engage people, this often makes them turn
away.
It has to relate to people’s live s. Fo r
e x a m p l e , we went to the arms fair in Greece
disguised as a public relations firm (see
b ox) not to just bring back general fa c t s
about the numbers of weapons sold. We
went to bring home inform ation say i n g,
“these guys are tort u r e rs and they’re using
UK equipment.” We are licensing arm s
abroad which are used for murder, r a p e ,
genocide and torture and yo u, the tax-
p aye r , h ave paid for it.Yo u h ave a choice
h e r e .
A lot of the human rights groups don’t
take this approach of making people res-
p o n s i b l e . Unless you engage people at their
l e vel without being pat r o n i z i n g, you’ll neve r
be ve ry effective . Instead you’ll have a lot of
h a n d - w ri n gi n g .And there’s enough of that
already.
Yo u ’ re like a plague politicians try to
a v o i d . But if the show’s success continues,
a politician with a bit of public re l a t i o n s
savvy could start to ask: “why hasn’t
Mark Thomas come and interviewed me
y e t ? ”
When that time comes,my wife has firm ins-
t ructions on how to use the handgun.

Women speak up against war. This
book supports their voices.
Photographs from all corners 
of the world and short comments
by key spokespersons of the 
peace movement illustrate women’s
rejection of war and violence.
In Women Say No to War
the camera is used to catch the
impact of war on women, 
to observe their courageous
resistance and, above all, their
desire to live in peace.
Preface: 
Federico Mayor
Introduction: 
Ingeborg Breines and 
Breda Pavlic
Conception and 
iconographical research:
Dominique Roger
