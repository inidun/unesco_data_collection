Bronze defiance in Venice
Dominating the great portal of St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, these colossal gilded
bronze horses have snorted defiance through nearly 24 centuries. Attributed to the
famous 4th century B.C. Greek sculptor Lysippus, they graced the Trajan Forum in
Rome until the Emperor Constantine moved them to Constantinople in the 4th century
A.D. In 1204, the Doge Enrico Dándolo had them shipped to Venice, where they stood
over the portal of St. Mark's till 1797 when Napoleon Bonaparte took them to Paris, to
adorn the triumphal arch of the Petit Carrousel. Finally, in 1815, they were returned
to St. Mark's. Today the preservation of Venice, threatened not only by the ravages
of time but also by flooding, pollution and industrialization, is the object of an inter¬
national campaign launched by Unesco in 1966. In 1973 the Italian Parliament endorsed
Unesco's initiative by voting 450 millions dollars for the protection of the city.

Few periods in man's history can boast the existence of one of those
rare intellectual giants whose genius not only embraces the knowledge
of his time but reaches out to uncharted, unknown frontiers. Such a
man was al-Biruni, born a thousand years ago, who ranks among the
greatest scholars of the Islamic world: Astronomer, mathematician,
physicist, geographer, historian, linguist, ethnologist, pharmacologist
as well as poet, novelist and philosopher al-Biruni's contribution to
human learning was unique. Despite the political upheavals which
interrupted his work, his sheer output was prodigious. He had a
scientific spirit in the full sense of the term and displayed a spirit of
understanding and respect for other cultures remarkable for his time.
His contribution was such that many scholars put him on a par with
or even higher than the great Avicenna. Yet unlike Avicenna, al-Biruni
is virtually unknown except to the rare specialist. The Unesco Courier
hopes that this special number will provide a small insight into the
extraordinary genius of this universal scholar and man of science.

ibn Ahmad al-Biruni, the great Central
Asian scholar, is one of those
intellectual giants whose stature
continues to grow as we become more
fully acquainted with their legacy.
One hundred years ago, when al-
Biruni's Chronology of Ancient Nations
was published in Russian, only one
facet of his many talents was apparent,
that of an outstanding medieval his¬
torian. But as more of his works were
discovered treatises on mathematics,
geography and astronomy and the
more deeply they were studied, the
higher al-Biruni stood out above the
mass of his contemporaries.
Al-Biruni was so far ahead of his
time that his most brilliant discoveries
seemed incomprehensible to most of
the scholars of his day. He was the
first to arrive at an amazingly simple
formula for measuring the earth's

Al-Biruni is claimed as a

circumference. He thought It possible
that the earth revolved around the sun.
He developed the idea that geological
eras succeed one another in cycles.
"With the passing of time, the sea
becomes dry land, and dry land the
sea," he wrote, and on this brilliant
hypothesis he based his theory of the
earth's geological history.
What enabled al-Biruni to move so
far ahead of his contemporaries and to
create works that made his name
known in the East as a symbol of
learning of the 11th century?
Khwarizm, in Central Asia, where
al-Biruni was born and grew up, had
long been famed for its advanced
culture. Its cities had magnificent
palaces, mosques and madrasahs
(religious colleges), and in this pros¬
perous, ancient state the sciences were
esteemed and highly developed.
The 10th and 11th centuries saw
the decline of the Arab caliphate in
Baghdad. New states arose on its
ruins, and a pleiad of illustrious Central
Asian scholars appeared, including
Abu-Nasr al-Farabi and ibn-Sina (Avi¬
cenna).
It was during this period that al-
Biruni was born near Kath, the capital
of Khwarizm, on 4 September, in the
year 973. "In truth, I am not certain
of my genealogy, for I do not really
know who my grandfather was. And
how could I know who my grandfather
was, when I do not even know who
was my father?" he wrote in a poem
which appears in one of his treatises.
In his early youth, fortune brought
him in contact with an educated Greek
who was to become his first teacher.
At the Greek's request, the young
al-Biruni collected plants, seeds and
fruit and this kindled his interest in the
natural sciences.
Al-Biruni's foster father was Abu-
Nasr Mansur ibn-Ali ibn Iraq, or simply
Mansur, a member of the Khwarizmian
royal family and a distinguished math¬
ematician and astronomer. He intro¬
duced al-Biruni to Euclidean geometry
and Ptolemaean astronomy, which
equipped the young scholar to study
astronomy.
"Most of my days were blessed by
gifts and privileges which were in¬
creasingly bestowed on me," wrote
al-Biruni, describing this period of his
life. "The Iraq family nourished me
with their milk and their Mansur took
it upon himself to rear me."
Al-Biruni studied the stars and
minerals, probed the secrets of the
heavens and the earth and read
thousands of books in order to fathom
the meaning of history. He constructed
a globe of the earth the first in
Central Asia and was equally gifted

AL-BIRUNI (Continued)
as a poet. He lived through the
feverish final years of the powerful
Samanid dynasty and witnessed the
rise and fall of two early feudal
empires the Karakhanid and the
Ghaznavid.
Social conflicts, feudal wars and
barbarian invasions left their imprint
on his manuscripts, since science does
not exist in a vacuum, least of all the
science of history. It might well have
been the violent social upheavals in
Khwarizm that suggested the theme of
his first major work, in which he
turned to the past for an understanding
of how society was evolving.
Al-Biruni completed his Chronology
of Ancient Nations at the age of 27,
just before the 11th century was born.
"My aim in this book," he explained,
"was to establish as accurately as poss¬
ible the time span of various eras."
His study begins at the dawn of the
human race, moves on to the period
of the great flood, and covers every
thing then known about the times of
Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the
Great.
The book explains various calendar
systems such as the Arabian, Greek
and Persian. The history of rulers,
heroes and political events is inter¬
woven with the history of culture,
customs and morals. The Chronology
of Ancient Nations should not be
considered as a purely historical work,
but as a partly historical and partly
ethnographic study that retains its full
significance to this day.
Soviet scholars of the 1930s referred
to the Chronology again and again in
their research on ancient Central Asia.
Only in al-Biruni's work could they find
an account of the Soghdian calendar,
essential to their study of early
8th century Soghdian documents; only
here could they find information about
pre-Muslim Khwarizm, which archae¬
ologists were just beginning to study.
Al-Biruni was no ivory tower scholar.
He met and came to know people in
many different walks of life and
maintained close contacts with his
fellow scholars. We know from letters
written by al-Biruni in Khwarizm, in the
year 997, to the 17 year-old Avicenna
in Bokhara, that these young scholars
discussed Aristotle's Physics and On
the Heavens, as well as the structure
of the universe, the physical laws
covering a free-falling object and in¬
divisible particles (atoms). Al-Biruni
devoted his work, Questions and Ans¬
wers to these exchanges (see article
page 27).
Al-Biruni's letters reveal a deep
respect for the ancient Greek philos¬
ophers and show him to be already a
mature man of science, despite his
youth. In the year 1010, he was ad¬
mitted to the Academy of al-Mamun,
which embraced a group of famous
scholars, including the philosopher and
natural scientist Avicenna, the historian
and philosopher ¡bn-Maskawayh and
the mathematician abu-Nasr Arrah.

Al-Biruni was born near the town of Kath, north-east of the ancient city of Khiva. Kath has vanished from the
map, but Khiva (today in Uzbekistan) still boasts palaces, religious colleges, mosques and burial monuments
that testify to the talent of its medieval architects and craftsmen. Shown here are two buildings in Khiva
today: the Baths of Anusha-khan (opposite) and the mausoleum of Pahlawan Mahmud (above) whose great
dome covered with blue tiles dominates the city.
Whereas European natural science
was in a state of stagnation at that
time, scholars in Khwarizm were
vigorously advancing along the path
traced by scientists of antiquity.
Khwarizm's economic growth during
the early feudal period had set the
stage for a golden age of science in
the early 11th century.
Commerce with northern peoples
the Khazars and Bulgars, the ancient
Russians, and the tribes of the Urals
and Western Siberia also influenced
scientific advancement. Learning
flourished in this fertile soil, with its
traditions of a thousand year-old
independent culture, combining the
"wisdom of neighbouring India with the
perfect lucidity of far-off Hellas."
Al-Biruni's frequent references to
Greek philosophy and scientific thought
demonstrate the encyclopedic scope of
his interests. He was familiar with
Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and had
studied Plato's treatises, Laws and
Phaedo. He was well acquainted with
the works of Aristotle, Archimedes and
Democritus, and extolled what he con¬
sidered the best of Greek philosophy.
The 11th century was a time of great
turmoil. The armed hosts of Mahmud
of Ghazna overran Khwarizm, in 1017,
taking thousands of prisoners, in¬
cluding al-Biruni. The decade which
followed was to be the most difficult
period in the scholar's life, but at the
same time his most productive. He
studied astronomy, collected materials
for a mathematics treatise, sought to
comprehend the influence of the moon
on the tides, and conceived his major
work on India, which represents the
zenith of his scientific thinking.
Arabic and Persian literature prior
to al-Biruni's time had depicted India
as a land of wonders. The Indians
were knowledgeable in astronomy and
arithmetic; they were said to have
invented chess, which in al-Biruni's
time was already considered an
intellectual game; they were ac¬
complished sculptors and poets; their
doctors were highly reputed, and it
was even affirmed that the science of
philosophy had originated In India.
In Ghazna, al-Biruni became ac¬
quainted with Indian scholars who, like
him, were exiled from their homeland.
His meetings and conversations with
them sparked his Interest in their
remarkable country. For a period of
12 years, up to the year 1030, al-Biruni
was totally absorbed in India.
Many people before al-Biruni had
travelled to India, especially to Sind
and its southern coast, and some
books that could serve historians as
a guide to studying the country had
been written. Al-Biruni's monumental
work on India, however, clearly
demonstrated a scientific, that is, ob¬
jective, approach to the subject. At
the age of 45, he began learning Sans¬
krit. He visited India several times,
walked on its soil, breathed its air,
compared and marvelled.

AL-BIRUNI (Continued)
A true scientist, al-Biruni strove to
share knowledge as well as to obtain
it. He translated Euclid's Elements
and his own treatise on astronomy into
Sanskrit. He also began a translation
of the Panchatantra into Arabic, as he
considered the existing translation of
this immortal literary classic to be in¬
adequate.
Al-Biruni's India became the major
source for studying 11th century India.
It covered the caste system, philos¬
ophy, the exact sciences, religion, laws,
customs, superstitions, legends, the
system of weights and measures, the
written language and geography. In
writing it, al-Biruni quoted 24 works by

portant cities and areas of

lifetime of al-Biruni. Right,

and India.
14 Greek writers and used 40 Sanskrit
sources. He was an objective re¬
searcher, free of racial bias, with a
deep respect for the advanced culture
of another people.
During the reign of Mas'ud, who
succeeded his father, Mahmud, as
Ghaznavid ruler, al-Biruni's situation
improved. The new king was an
enlightened man who encouraged the
sciences. Al-Biruni dedicated his
major work on astronomy, The Mas'udic
Canon, to him. In the opinion of al-
Biruni's contemporaries and suc¬
cessors, he surpassed his ancient
mentor, Ptolemy, in this work.

scholar an elephant loaded with pure
silver, al-Biruni replied: "This gift
would seduce me from science. Wise
men know that silver is soon spent but
science lives on. I would never
exchange the perennial wealth of
scientific knowledge for the short-lived
tawdry glitter of silver."
Al-Biruni's main interests were math¬
ematics, astronomy, geography, physics
and geodesy but in his last work, the
Pharmacology, he classified the physi¬
cal features of plants, animals and
minerals, and compiled an alphabetical
list of medicinal herbs and their uses.
Besides Arabic names, al-Biruni
listed about 900 Persian, 700 Greek,
400 Syrian and 350 Indian names in
the Pharmacology. He referred to
Aristotle's works on biology, and also
to the writings of Dioscorides and
Galen, physicians and pharmacologists
of the 1st and 2nd centuries. Un¬
fortunately, the Pharmacology was not
completed, but even in the form it has
come down to us its values is self-
evident.
Al-Biruni's contemporaries spoke of
him thus: "Except for two festive
days each year, his hand never stopped
writing, his eyes observing, his mind
contemplating." When he died in 1048,
at the age of 75, more than 150 works
had flowed from his pen. They
include 70 on astronomy, 20 on math¬
ematics and 18 on literature, including
translations, and bibliographies. He
was famed as a cartographer, meteor¬
ologist, physicist, philosopher, historian
and ethnographer.
Only 27 of his works have come
down to us. Whether the rest were
destroyed or simply have not been
found is not known. Abu'l Faraj, the
Syrian historian and physician, wrote
of al-Biruni, the man he regarded as
his mentor: "His works gre numerous,
exhaustive and completely reliable.
There was no one, neither among his
colleagues, nor to this day, so well
versed in astronomy, from its main
principles down to the smallest
details."
Al-Biruni had a vast impact on
science in the East. Many countries
claim him as their own, but this son
of Khwarizm, one of Central Asia's
most brilliant civilizations, belongs to
all nations and to all time.

Chess was first played in
Asia and many authorities
agree that it originated in
India. In al-Biruni's day it
was already a popular game
in Central Asia, and he may
himself have handled pieces
like the ones shown here of
carved ivory (4 cm. high),
dating from the time when he
lived. They were unearthed
near the village of Kurban-
Sheid, in Tajikstan, in a region

THE LONG
ODYSSEY
by Jacques Boilot
In the footsteps of a Muslim scholar
through a world in ferment
10
FATHER JACQUES BOILOT, distinguished
French orientalist, has devoted many years
to the study of al-Biruni. His 'L'suvre
d'al-Biruni : Essai Bibliographique" is regarded
as the standard bibliographical work on the
subject. He is a member of the Dominican
Institute of Oriental Studies (formerly the
French Institute of Oriental Archaeology) in
Cairo. His article is abridged from a study
on al-Biruni published in the Dominican
Institute's review, "Mélanges" (No 11,1972).

Miniatures on these pages are from two different manuscripts of
al-Biruni's Chronology of Ancient Nations. Opposite, copied and
illustrated in Cairo in the 17th century, a miniature portraying the
Sassanian king Feroz addressing his court (1). The four miniatures
above are from a manuscript probably made at Tabriz, Iran, dated
1307. They show the celebration of the autumnal equinox by the
Hindus (5); a barbecue with roast fowl and game (4); a discussion
between a sage and a peasant (2); and the birth of Caesar (3),
an early pictorial representations of the surgical operation which
bears his name. Al-Biruni himself used the term "Caesarian".
kL-BIRUNI is one of the
greatest scholars of medieval Islam
and probably the most original and
profound of all. His Eastern contem¬
poraries called him al-Ostadh (The
Master).
How did his fame spread to the West
in the Middle Ages? 'His major works
were apparently not translated into
Latin, with the possible exception of a
few peripheral chapters dealing with
natural magic, judicial astrology, talis-
manic art . . . The extraordinary features
of his life as recounted by his Eastern
biographers perhaps added to his
reputation. Early French texts that
speak of a "Maître Aliboron" are
almost certainly alluding to "Master
al-Biruni", scientist, doctor and man of
deep wisdom.
While al-Biruni's work is of great
value in itself and deserves serious
study by historians of science, religion
and philosophy, it is the Master's
mental outlook and the nature of his
intellectual interests that scholars
today find stimulating.
Fifteen years ago we wrote: "Appar¬
ently not much given to making
generalized syntheses by systemized
deduction, or metaphysical speculation
in the strict sense of the term, but
constantly on the look-out for positive
facts carefully and critically observed,
trained to think mathematically, In¬
terested in everything concretely
related to human life, he appears at
the beginning of the eleventh century
like a champion of the scientific spirit
as it is understood today.
"He showed great religious tolerance
and doctrinal objectivity. Above all,
he wanted to learn and understand.
He was relatively unprejudiced but
prepared to take a courageous stand
in defence of truth. He was one of
the first Muslims to study the phil¬
osophy and science of India sympath¬
etically, and in exchange he taught
those of Greece."
So it Is al-Biruni the man we wish to
discover, by piecing together such
facts as will help us to place him in
his setting and his time.
This puts us in the latter part of the
tenth century In Khwarizm, a central
Asian country situated south of the
Aral Sea, along the Amu-Dar'ya river,
the Oxus of the ancients (1).
The sultanate of Khwarizm had en¬
joyed relative independence throughout
its history but successive wars and
changes in the course of the Amu-
Dar'ya river brought about the de¬
struction of one medieval city after
another. As a result, It Is difficult to
determine the exact site of Kath, the
city where al-Biruni was born in
973 A.D., beyond the fact that it was
probably situated on the right bank
of the Amu-Dar'ya river north-east of
the modern town of Khiva.
The second largest city in Khwarizm
was Jurjaniyya on the opposite bank
and to the north of Khiva. Today it
is known as Urgench. On the right
bank across from Urgench, a new town
has risen not very far perhaps from
ancient Kath, and its name, "Biruni",
commemorates the scientist's birth¬
place.
(1) Now part of the Soviet Socialist
Republic of Uzbekistan, this region is in¬
habited by Turkmenlan and Mongolian
peoples, the Karakalpaks, whose lands form
the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic.

THE LONG ODYSSEY (Continued)
Al-Biruni very early began scientific
studies and at the age of 17 he used
a ring graduated in halves of a degree
to observe the height of the sun at
the Kath meridian and thus calculate
the latitude of the city. Four years
later he made plans for a series of
observations and measurements, and
had prepared an astronomical ring
15 cubits (8 metres) in diameter along
with other equipment.
At this time, civil war broke out in
Khwarizm and al-Biruni, who was
now 22, went into hiding and soon had
to flee the country.
In order to understand al-Biruni's
long career from then on, we must take
into account the political situation in
the countries where he was to live. In
addition to what is now Uzbekistan,
they comprised the northern part of
present-day Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan
and northern India. Al-Biruni in the
course of his life was directly involved
with six princely dynasties.
Who was the prince that al-Biruni
fled to for protection in 9957 We do
not know with certainty. It may have
been then that he went to the town of
Ray, near present-day Teheran. In his
Chronology of Ancient Nations he
quotes a poem on the tribulations of
poverty, and recounts that when he
was living in Ray without royal
patronage and destitute, a local
astrologer scoffed at his views on
some technical matter simply because
he was poor. Later, when his situation
improved, the same man became
friendly.
At that time, the flourishing Bowayhid
dynasty, which had originated in the
mountains south of the Caspian Sea,
extended its domain south towards the
Persian Gulf and west to Mesopotamia.
At the request of the Bowayhid
prince, Fakhr al-Dawla, the astronomer
al-Khojandi had built a large mural
sextant on a mountain above the town
of Ray. He used this "Fakhri Sextant"
so named after the prince to
observe the sun's transits throughout
the year 994.
Al-Biruni wrote a treatise describing
this sextant and giving a detailed
account of the observations made,
based on information given to him by
al-Khojandi in person. As the astron¬
omer died about the year 1000, his
scientific discussions with the young
al-Biruni in Ray, must have dated from
shortly after the observations carried
out in 994.
There is reason to believe that al-
Biruni was also in the province of
Gilan, along the south-west corner of
the Caspian Sea about this time. One of
his books Is dedicated to the Ispahbad
("ruler" or "commander") of Jilan. In
the Chronology of Ancient Nations
which was finished by the year 1000,
he speaks of having been in the
presence of the Ispahbad of Jilan
perhaps the same official who pro¬
tected Firdausi, the epic poet of Persia,
from the wrath of Sultan Mahmud.
In any event, al-Biruni was certainly
back in Kath by 997. On 24 May in
that year, he observed an eclipse of
the moon in Kath, after arranging to
have the great Muslim mathematician,
Abu' l-Wafa, observe the same
phenomenon in Baghdad. The time
difference between the respective
observations enabled the two scientists
to calculate the difference in longitude
between the two points.
HE short reign of the Sa-
manid Mansur II began the same year,
997, and it was also about that time
that al-Biruni visited his court at the.
capital city of Bokhara. The Samanid
dynasty, a royal house of Zoroastrian
origin, but early converted to Islam,
ruled an area comprising all of modern
Afghanistan, Transoxiana and Iran.
Meanwhile, 0aDUS, the Ziyarid ruler
of Gurgan, a city at the south-east
corner of the Caspian Sea, had been
driven from his lands, and was trying
to obtain support from Bokhara in an
effort to return to power. He suc
ceeded in reinstating himself in Gurgan
and al-Biruni followed him there.
The Chronology, al-Biruni's first
major work, seems to have been
written at the Gurgan court. This
book, which treats of calendars and
eras, and fundamental problems in
mathematics, astronomy, meteorology,
was dedicated to 0aDUS about the year
390 of the Islamic calendar (1000 A.D.).
In it al-Biruni refers to seven other
books that he had already completed,
dealing with decimal numbers, the
astrolabe, astronomical observations,
astrology and history.
During this period al-Biruni was
carrying on an acrimonious correspon¬
dence with a young prodigy, the
brilliant philosopher and physician of
Bokhara, Ibn Sina, known in the Latin
countries as Avicenna, who was seven
years his junior (see article page 27).
Among the subjects on which they
exchanged views were the nature and
transmission of heat and light. Al-
Biruni was not yet 30 years old at the
time and Avicenna was in his early
twenties.
In his book on geodesy, after de¬
scribing the measurement of a degree
along a terrestrial meridian, made at
the direction of the Caliph Ma'mun, al-
Biruni describes his own failure to
repeat the operation. A suitable tract
of land had been chosen between Gur¬
gan and the land of the Oghuz Turks
(on the deserts east of the Caspian)
but the patron, presumably Oabus, lost
interest.

THE TOWER OF QABUS
Al-Biruni lived at a time of great ferment in learning and
the arts. About 1 000 A.D., he was living at Gurgan, in
north-east Iran, at the court of Qabus, to whom he dedicated
his first known major work, the Chronology of Ancient
Nations. Left, the famous tower of Qabus. It was long
believed to be the ruler's tomb, but recent investigation
has revealed no trace of a burial chamber. Al-Biruni may
have watched the tower being built, since elegantly carved
Arabic inscriptions at its summit and base record that
Qabus ordered its construction in 1006 A.D. when al-Biruni
was 33 years old. The region had been reputed since the
9th century for its pottery. Below, platter and bowl shaped
by Samanid potters who worked in Transoxiana and in
Khorassan, countries in which al-Biruni sojourned for several
years. Kufic Arabic inscriptions adorn platter (left); glazed
bowl (right) bears a stylized bird motif.

The end of al-Biruni's stay at the
Ziyarid court can be precisely estab¬
lished, for in 1003 he observed two
lunar eclipses from Gurgan, one on
19 February and the other on 14 Au¬
gust. The following year he observed
a third lunar eclipse, but this time
from Jurjaniyya, on 4 June. Thus in
the interim, he had returned to his
homeland, high in favour with the
reigning Khwarizmshah.
Thanks to the Khwarizmshah's liber¬
ality, al-Biruni was able to construct
in Jurjaniyya an astronomical instru¬
ment which in gratitude he called the
"Shah's Circle". In all probability it
was a large ring fixed on the plane of
the meridian.
Al-Biruni speaks in several places
in the Tahdid, his book on geodesy,
and in his Canon on astronomy, of
15 observations of the sun's transit
over the meridian in Jurjaniyya, the
first one at the summer solstice on
7 June 1016, and the last one on
7 December of the same year. It was
probably during this period of pros¬
perity and royal favour that he had a
hemisphere ten cubits (5.4 metres) in
diameter built to help solve geodesic
problems graphically.
Meantime the political atmosphere
in the sultanate of Khwarizm was
becoming more and more tense. In the
Tahdid al-Biruni writes: "I had enjoyed
only a few years of peace when the
Lord of Time (God) allowed me to
return to my own country; but there
I was forced to take part in public
affairs, which caused fools to envy me
and wise men to pity me."
Ma'mun, the Khwarizmshah, confided
several difficult political missions to
al-Biruni, who carried them out skil¬
fully "with tongue of silver and of
gold". But Ma'mun was assassinated
by some of his troops in revolt and
this gave the Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud
an opportunity to march against
Khwarizm with a large army. From
its base In east-central Afghanistan the
kingdom of the Ghaznavids was swiftly
expanding. By 1020, Sultan Mahmud
had carved out a realm extending a
thousand miles north and south and
twice as far east and west.
»L-BIRUNI was among those
deported by the conqueror to Ghazna
in Sijistan (Afghanistan), partly no
doubt to enhance the sultan's court
with his presence, but also In order to
get rid of an active supporter of the
Khwarizmian pretenders. He was then
44 years old.
The following year we find him in
a village south of Kabul, downcast and
livinq in misery, but working hard on
the Tahdid. On 14 October 1018 he
wanted to measure the height of the
sun but had no instrument to hand.
So he was obliged to draw a calibrated
arc on the back of a reckoning board
and use it.with the aid of a plumb line,
as a makeshift quadrant
On the basis of the measurements
made with this crude device he calcu¬
lated the latitude of the locality. On
8 April, 1019, he observed an eclipse
of the sun at Lamghan, a town to the
north-east of Kabul.
Al-Biruni's relations with Sultan
Mahmud were never cordial. It is
evident, none the less, that he was
given official support for his work. In
his Canon he relates that he determin¬
ed the latitude of Ghazna by a series
of observations made between 1018
and 1020 with an instrument which he
calls the "Yamini Ring". Yamin al-
Dawla (Right Hand of the State) was
one of the titles conferred on Mahmud
by the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad, and
the monumental instrument was named,
according to custom, after the royal
patron.
It is also evident that al-Biruni's
interests in Sanscrit and the civilization
of India were due to his forced resi¬
dence in an empire that now extended
well into the Indian subcontinent. In
1021 the conquering sultan subjugated
the Ganges Valley almost as far as
Benares, and in 1026, by a daring raid
south starting from Ghazna, he reached
the Indian Ocean.
Al-Biruni took advantage of these
events to visit various parts of India
and stayed there more or less volun¬
tarily. We know that he journeyed to
the Punjab and Kashmir regions,
though no dates can be given for his
visits. He determined the latitudes of
a number of towns, and reports that

Seven years ago the existence of the mosque of Nouh-Goumbed
with its nine domes, one of the early examples of Islamic archi¬
tecture in Central Asia, was unknown to modern scholars. Its
imposing ruins, hidden away in the remoteness of north-west
Afghanistan on the site of the ancient city of Balkh, were studied
and described by archeologists only in 1967. In this region
al-Biruni set the scene of one of his romances, The Two
Idols of Bamian (see page 30). Up to the 7th century, Balkh
was an important seat of Buddhist learning. After its conquest
by the Arabs in 663, its fame as an intellectual and artistic centre
spread even wider and its splendours were recounted by Arab
and Chinese travellers and historians. The nine domes of this
almost square mosque were once supported on pointed arches
resting on six central columns. The domes have fallen in, but even
in its present state the mosque gives an impression of beauty
and strength. This is in part due to the size of the six columns
1.56 metres in diameter (above) and to the manner in which the
baked bricks are separated by small decorated interstices 4 to
5 cm. wide. The exterior (above left) is ravaged by time, but
the interior decoration is well preserved (see ornamental detail
below left). The floral and geometrical motifs are found on the
stucco carvings which cover the entire surface above the columns
in an infinite profusion of designs, none of which is repeated,
except on the capitals. The decorative features and form of
construction enabled archaeologists to place the mosque in the
9th century and as "an architectural achievement without precedent".

THE LONG ODYSSEY (Continued from page 13)
16
while he was living at Fort Nandana,
he used a nearby mountain to calculate
the diameter of the earth. Nandana
had been taken by Mahmud in 1014.
It controlled the route by which he, the
Moghuls after him, and Alexander the
Great long before penetrated the Indus
Valley.
Al-Biruni spent a long time in Ghazna
itself and made many astronomical
observations there, including transits
of the sun across the meridian at the
time of the summer solstice in 1019,
an eclipse of the moon on 16 Septem¬
ber 1019, and equinoxes and solstices
up to the winter solstice in 1021. It
was then that he completed his treatise
Shadows.
In 1024, the ruler of the Turks along
the Volga sent an embassy to Ghazna.
The Turks had trade relations with the
inhabitants of the polar regions, and
al-Biruni was able to add to his know¬
ledge of those countries by question¬
ing the envoys. One of them stated
in the sultan's presence that some¬
times in the far north the sun did not
set for days. Mahmud at first con¬
sidered this as heresy and was enrag¬
ed, but al-Biruni convinced him that
It was perfectly plausible.
In 1027, the year that the treatise
Chords was finished, a Chinese and
Uighur Turkish legation came to
Ghazna. From this mission, al-Biruni
obtained geographical information
about the Far East which he later
included In his Canon.
Sultan Mahmud died in 1030, and
soon afterwards al-Biruni completed
his encyclopaedic book, India, but he
did not dedicate it to any particular
patron. Within the year (1030) the
sultan's eldest son, Mas'ud succeeded
to the crown and then the situation of
his most famous scientist changed
completely.
Al-Biruni put the final touches to his
third major work, the Canon of Astro¬
nomy, and dedicated it to the new
sovereign in florid terms.
In this book he takes issue with
Ptolemy's system on several points.
He holds, for example, that the sun's
apogee is not fixed, and while he
accepts the geocentric theory, he
shows that the astronomical facts can
also be explained by assuming that the
earth revolves round the sun.
According to one chronicler, Mas'ud
offered the Master an elephant-load of
silver coins for this work, but al-Biruni
declined the gift. Nevertheless he
was provided with the means to con¬
tinue his scientific and literary studies
as long as he lived.
It may have been because of this
change of regime that he was able to
re-visit his native country. He made
at least one trip back, for in his
Bibliography he writes that for over
forty years he had sought a certain
Manichaean work, a copy of which he
finally procured in Khwarizm.
Al-Biruni recounts that after the age
of 50 he suffered from a number of
serious ailments. In his distress, he-
questioned several astrologers about;
how much time he had left to live.;
Their replies were at total variance
with one another and some were
obviously absurd. In point of fact,,
towards the end of his 61st year
(possibly his 61st lunar year) his
health began to improve.
One night he dreamt that lie was
observing the new moon and when its
crescent disappeared he heard a voice
predicting that he would be able to
gaze upon it 170 times more. As It
turned out, he lived longer than
170 more lunations (14 lunar years).
It was during the reign of Mawdud,
son of Sultan Mas'ud, (1040-1048) that
al-Biruni wrote Gems, his book on
precious and semi-precious stones
and on metals. Following this period,
even though his sight and hearing were
failing, as he himself tells us in his
last book, he carried on his research
assiduously with the aid of a Greek
assistant.
His final work was the Pharmacology
which ¡s a tribute to his prodigious
erudition. Al-Biruni tells us that he
was over eighty years old (lunar
years?) when he was still working on
this compilation, which brings us down
to the year 1050 or later. The date
of his death, as given by Ghadanfar.
December 1048 Is therefore
inexact. Ultimately, he survived his
third Ghaznavid patron and lived
longer than the time predicted in his
dream.
Al-Biruni was Persian by birth. He
was brought up In the Khwarizm dialect
and later used Neo-Persian as his
spoken tongue, but out of choice he
preferred the Arabic language as an
instrument of thought and a means of
expression in his intellectual life, both
for his scientific treatises and his
purely literary works.
Thus his writings constitute a monu¬
ment in the history of ideas and doc¬
trines within the Arab world before
forming part of the general history of
human thought, as a contribution from
the Arabic-speaking world where they
came into being and first acquired their
fame.
In point of fact, al-Biruni, personally
and well ahead of his time, was a
promoter of mutual understanding and
fruitful cultural exchange between the
East and the West though he may
not have thought of himself as such
through the active mediation of the
Arabic language and the profoundly
humanistic values Inherent in it.
By virtue of his scientific method,
which makes him a model for the
Eastern world even today and ensures
him the gratitude of Western science,
he was a forerunner; and in his apti¬
tude for inter-cultural understanding,
he formed a connecting link between
East and West, just as his work is a
manifestation of their underlying unity
and fraternity.

»FTER the dismemberment
of the Empire of Charlemagne, the
Christian West was at a low ebb. The
tenth century was a sombre period
when conditions favoured neither the
growth of great political empire-building
movements nor the dissemination of
philosophical ideas.
In the Muslim East, however, the
tenth century was a time of brilliant
intellectual progress. The empires of
the East, linked by a vigorous faith,
attracted to themselves a great number
of scholars who made a unique contri¬
bution to the cultural heritage of
mankind.
In the empire of the Samanids (819-
1005), with its capital in Bokhara, the
talents of poets such as Rudaki and
Daqiqi and of scholars such as Rhazes
and Avicenna, flourished, while Ghazna,
the capital of the empire of the Ghaz-
navids (977-1186), which stretched
from western India as far as Khwarizm,
was the home of many poets and
scholars such as 'Unsuri and Firdausi,
the author of the Book of Kings, epic
masterpiece of Persian literature.
Al-Biruni was one of the many
scholars and philosophers who were
drawn to the court of Sultan Mahmud
(998-1030) in Ghazna, where he was
employed as the court astronomer.
This mixture of astrology and astron¬
omy was not, however, enough to
satisfy the thirst for knowledge of a
man with such an enquiring mind.
Al-Biruni's works, both before and
after his arrival In Ghazna, show him
to have been a man of many and varied
interests. He carried out research in
almost all the subjects known at that
time. Among the pure sciences,
astronomy was naturally the pivotal
point around which all his other
interests revolved.
The extent of his knowledge, particu¬
larly in astronomy, may be judged from
two main works: the Mas'udic Canon
and the Kitab al-Tafhim (a book of in¬
structions on the elements of the
science of astrology).
The Mas'udic Canon is an almost
complete encyclopedia of astronomy
and of the related sciences. It consists
of 11 volumes dealing simultaneously
with cosmology, chronology, geography
and mathematics as well as astronomy.
Avicenna's Canon of Medicine is justly
famous, but the sheer scale and the
intrinsic value of the Mas'udic Canon
place it in the same category.
In compiling the works of his pre¬
decessors, al-Biruni corrected many of
their mistakes, both theoretical and
experimental. He never made a formal
break with the geocentric system which
was universally accepted In the Middle
Ages. He was, however, aware of the
existence of the heliocentric system
from the works of Greek astronomers
like Asistarchus of Samos, and also
from the teachings of certain sages
whom he had met in India.
Al-Biruni hesitated for many years
between the two systems and in fact
remained undecided until his death; it
is important to stress, however, that

SCIENTIFIC OBSERVATION (Continued)
he always maintained that there was
absolutely no contradiction between the
heliocentric hypothesis and the laws
of astronomy. As he himself said:
" I have seen the astrolabe called
Zuraqi invented by Abu Sa'id Sijzi.
I liked it very much and praised him
a great deal, as it is based on the idea
entertained by some to the effect that
the motion we see is due to the Earth's
movement and not to that of the sky.
By my life, it is a problem difficult of
solution and refutation . . . For it is the
same whether you take it that the Earth
is in motion or the sky. For, In both
cases, it does not affect the Astronomi¬
cal Science. It is just for the physicist
to see if it is possible to refute it."
Al-Biruni was throughly familiar with
the astronomical works of Ptolemy and
other Greek astronomers. In geometry,
his work Is based on that of Euclid and
of Archimedes and Theon (4th cen¬
tury A.D.), but he was also acquainted
with the work of the great Indian
astronomer Brahmagupta (6th to
7th centuries A.D.) and the astronomi¬
cal works of the Indian, Tabahafara
(7th century A.D.).
In his book on India, al-Biruni quotes
a passage from Brahmagupta's book
concerning the rotation of the earth:
"The followers of Aryabhata maintain
that the earth is moving and heaven
resting. People have tried to refute
them by saying that, if such were the
case, stones and trees would fall from
the earth. "
But, says al-Biruni:
"Brahmagupta does not agree with
them, and says that that would not
necessarily follow from their theory,
apparently because he thought that all
heavy things are attracted towards the
centre of the earth . . .
"Besides, the rotation of the earth
does in no way impair the value of
astronomy, as all appearances of an
astronomic character can quite as well
be explained according to this theory
as to the other. There are, however,
other reasons which make it imposs¬
ible. This question is most difficult
to solve. The most prominent of both
modem and ancient astronomers have
deeply studied the question of the
moving of the earth, and tried to refute
it. We, too, have composed a book
on the subject called Miftah-ilm-alhai'a
(Key to Astronomy), in which we think
we have surpassed our predecessors,
if not in the words, at all events In the
matter."
In his measurements of the circum¬
ference of the earth, he was only
110 km. out by comparison with modern
measurements. He studied the sun
during the eclipse and ways of measur¬
ing the illuminated parts of the moon.
He described the various phases of the
dawn and the dusk and carried out
observations of the new moon. He
studied the astronomy of the stars.
He classified the celestial bodies
(planets and fixed stars) by order of
magnitude (in fact by their luminosity.)
He noted stars' positions and observed
their apparent motion around the poles.
His list included 1,029 stars.
He learned about trigonometry from
India, and was the first to establish it
as a science distinct from that of
astronomy.
He was the first geometrician to use
the radius of the circle as unity, an
idea which immenseley simplified
calculations. He wrote the best
medieval account of the arithmetical
systems used in India and on methods
of extracting the cube root.
Al-Biruni compiled a table of the
latitudes and longitudes of the 600 most
important towns and localities in the
Islamic world; this enabled him to
determine with scientific accuracy the
direction of Mecca, to which Muslims
turn to pray. When constructing
mosques, builders could thus place the
mihrabs (semicircular niches In the
wall indicating the direction of Mecca)
correctly.
For the purposes of cartography, he
invented a special system of stereo-
graphic projection, remarkably simple
to use, whereby the part of the globe
to be represented is projected on the
great circle of which the point of vision
is the pole.
Al-Biruni was severely critical of
astrologers and their unscientific
approach to their work. Thus it was
that he came to write a treatise which
he called A Warning Against the Art of
False Predictions by the Stars. In the
Mas'udic Canon, he denounced the
alleged "secrets" of astrologers' pre¬
dictions, pointing out that, although
they were supposed to be dictated by
the influence of the celestial bodies on
human lives, one prediction often
contradicted another.
He was also a geologist and ob¬
served the stratified structure of the
rocks, noting that:
"We have to rely upon the records
of the rocks and vestiges of the past
to infer that all these changes should
have taken place very long ago and
under unknown conditions of cold and
heat: for even now it takes a long time
for water and wind to do their work.
And changes have been going on and
observed and noticed within historical
times."

MINIATURE ANTHOLOGY
Selections from works by al-Biruni
including many translated
into English for the first time
Al-Biruni is believed to have written at least 150 works (180 according to some
authorities) by the time of his death about 1050 A.D. The actual number is uncer¬
tain since roughly four-fifths of his writings have vanished. Al-Biruni himself
recorded 113 titles in a bibliography he prepared in 1036 when he was 63 years
of age. In this special supplement, the "Unesco Courier" presents passages from
the writings of al-Biruni, including many translated into English for the first
time. Those we present here have been chosen not only to show the originality
and encyclopaedic scope of his thinking, but in particular his narrative talents and
the scientific approach he made to every subject. Highly technical and scientific
material has naturally been excluded. The passages published are taken from:
Alberuni's India (translated by Edward C. Sachau, 2 volumes, London, 1888);
The Chronology of Ancient Nations (translated by Edward C. Sachau, London,
1879); Al-Biruni's Book on Pharmacy and Materia Medica (translated by Hakim
Mohammed Said, Karachi, 1973); The Determination of the Co-ordinates of
Cities (Geodesy); The Mas'udic Canon on Astronomy; Gems, and Bibliography
of the Works ofal-Razi.

INTELLIGENCE
AND REASONING
Some believe that science is of recent
origin, others that it is as old as the
world. The former affirm that its tech¬
niques were taught by "initiation" and
go so far as to maintain that every
technique was revealed and implanted
by a particular prophet. But there are
others who think that man discovers
techniques with the help of Intelligence
and that it is reasoning which enables
the mind to acquire understanding . . .
When one discovers, by reasoning, a
law or principle, one must proceed from
the general to the particular. At the
same time, experiment and reflection
allow us to compare one thing with
another and so obtain knowledge in
detail...
Time is limitless and successive
generations traverse only stages. Each
passes on its heritage to the next,
which develops and enriches it. That
is the true metempsychosis, not the
soul, which simply passes from one
body to another.

ANTIQUITY'S
SUEZ CANAL
When the Persian kings conquered
Egypt they tried to cut a canal through
the isthmus to link the two seas [the
Red Sea and the Mediterranean]. Sea¬
going vessels would thus have been
able to sail direct from west to east.
The first king to dream of such a canal
was Sesostris, whose idea was taken
up by Darius. A waterway of consider¬

that its waters would engulf that river.

SCUBA DIVING
IN 1000 A.D.
Someone from Bagdad has told me
that pearl divers have recently discover¬
ed a method for overcoming the problem
of breathing under water. They are thus
able to dive from morning till evening,
for as long as they like... The device is
a leather sac<< which the diver passes
over his head and which extends to
just below his chest. He attaches it
very firmly just beneath the lower ribs
then he dives and breathes the air
contained in the bag. But a heavy
weight is needed to draw the diver,
with his air supply, towards the bottom
and to keep him down. It would be
more advantageous to fix to the upper
part of the device a leather tube shaped
like a sleeve, the seams of which are
hermetically sealed by wax and tar.
The length of the tube should corres¬
pond to the depth of water in which
the diver has to work. The upper end
of the tube should be fixed into a large
vessel through an opening pierced in
the bottom. One or more bladders
attached to the vessel would keep It
afloat. Breathing air in and out through
the tube, the diver could then stay
under water as long as he wished, even
through the entire day.

THE NATURE OF GOD
. . . Some Hindu scholar calls God
a point, meaning to say thereby that
the qualities of bodies do not apply
to him. Now some uneducated man
reads this and imagines that God
is as small as a point, and he does not
find out what the word point in this
sentence was really intended to express.
He will not even stop with this offensive
comparison, but will describe God as
much larger, and will say "He is twelve
fingers long and ten fingers broad."
Praise be to God, who is far above
measure and numberl Further, if an
uneducated man hears what we have
mentioned, that God comprehends the
universe so that nothing is concealed
from him, he will at once imagine that
this comprehending is effected by means
of eyesight; that eyesight is only
possible by means of an eye, and that
two eyes are better than only one; and
in consequence he will describe God as
having a thousand eyes, meaning to
describe his omniscience.

the cold in those places, though severe,
is not so extreme.
Furthermore, there are among these
folk fishermen and hunters who put far
out to sea during the summer days and,
following the Azimuth of the North Pole,
reach places where the Sun at the
summer solstice never descends below
the horizon; observing this with their
own eyes, they then boast among their
kindred that they have been In places
where there is no night at all.
As concerns the impossibility of the
inhabited regions continuing uninter¬
ruptedly to east and west, there Is no
excess of heat or cold to prevent this,
but habitability comes to an end because
the dry land emerged from the oneness
of the waters by the will of God as
well as from natural causes. The dry
land must therefore be a separate part
without continuation and it must be
bounded by the encompassing waters.
Hence it must have boundaries both to
the east and to the west.
The sea which lies to the south of
the dry land I assume to be a sea leading
out of the encircling sea to the East of
China, stretching along the Equator
parallel tb China, then to India and to
Persia, and then to the land of the
Arabs, and ending in a gulf of the Sea
of Kulzum [Red Sea]. In every place
it is called by the name of the country
off whose shores it passes.
Similarly, the sea which runs out
of the Encircling Sea to the west of
ZinJ by the headland known as Rasun
(2), stretches southward from the Equa¬
tor parallel to the land of the Negroes
and the Sofala of the Zinj (3).
Both these regions are located
beneath the zenith of the Sun, Moon and
Stars, for which reason their climate is
mild and their waters are easily navi¬
gable.
As concerns the Encircling Ocean to
the West [Atlantic Ocean], it Is an
enormous mass of water, but there are
many shoals and shallows in it where
the water becomes viscous, like a mud
spring, so that navigation Is difficult
and its paths are unknown. It was for
this reason that the great Hercules set
his signs and pillars opposite Andalus,
so that sailors might be deterred from
the ambition of sailing beyond them.
The place where they were set up was
then probably dry land which has since
been covered by the waters.
A worthy traveller recounts in a mes¬
sage to Khamza ibn al-Hasan al-lsfa-
hani (4) the wonders which he saw In
the West. He recalls having sailed
through a narrow strait, the strait [Straits
of Gibraltar] connecting the Syrian Sea
[Mediterranean] with the Encircling Sea
The shores were visible both on the
side of Andalus and on the side of
Tangier and Further Sus (5). He looked
Into the waters of the Strait and saw
In Its depths a mighty bridge of rock,
and one of those present affirmed that
It had been built by Alexander. But
the Andalusians exclaimed: "The devil
take your Alexanderl Could he have
taken the land of the Andalusians to
build this? This was built of old by
Hercules I "
I believe that "Hercules' crossing"
mentioned in Ptolemy's "Geography" is
nothing other than this bridge. It was
undoubtedly once above water, but the
water then rose up and covered it.
As concerns the Encircling Sea to
the East [Pacific Ocean] it is often
shrouded in darkness and is a place
of frequent calms, where navigation is
most dangerous.
It is believed that these two seas, the
one to the West and the one to the
East of the dry land [the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans] are not Joined together.
But those who have sailed these seas
and have suffered shipwrecks because
of the storms recount things which lead
us to believe that they may be joined.
Recent evidence has furthermore
strengthened these suppositions and
indeed given them the character of truth.
Ship's timbers have been found bound
together In the Encircling Sea near its
confluence with the Syrian Sea. But
it is only In the Indian Sea that timbers
are lashed together In this way (because
of the many magnetic stones which are
there and are a danger to shipping) and
not in the Western Sea, where the
ships' timbers are not lashed together
but fastened with Iron nails. The pre¬
sence of these timbers in the Western
Sea is proof that they arrived there by
(1) Slavs who settled on the shores of
the Baltic the Pomeranians and the
Novgorodian Slovenes.

some waterway connecting it to the
Indian Sea. This could not have happen¬
ed by way of the Sea of Kulzum for
between it and the Syrian Sea there
lies an isthmus.
Nor is it easy to envisage a junction
between the two by way of the sea
which lies to the north. In such a case,
the timbers, after being broken up in
the Indian Sea, would have had to drift
out of it through an eastern strait linking
the seas (6) and would then have had
to drift around those parts lying to the
north beneath the zenith of the Polar
Star or through the other northern
quarters of the Earth lying opposite the
dry land.
This cannot be what happened. Espe¬
cially when it is considered that those
who speak of the joining of the seas
point out that the level of the eastern
waters is higher than that of the western
waters, just as it was discovered when
the land was being surveyed that the
waters of the Sea of Kulzum are higher
than those which run into the Syrian
Sea. The conclusion must be that the
seas are linked to the south of the dry
land.

POWER OF MOONLIGHT
That the moon has certain effects on
moist substances, that they are appar¬
ently subject to her influences, that,
for instance, increase and decrease in
ebb and flow develop periodically and
parallel with the moon's phases, all this
is well .known to the inhabitants of
seashores and seafaring people.
Likewise physicians are well aware
that she affects the humores of sick
people, and that the fever-days revolve
parallel with the moon's course. Phy¬
sical scholars know that the life of
animals and plants depends upon the
moon, and experimentalists know that
she influences marrow and brain, eggs
and the sediments of wine in casks
and jugs, that she excites the minds
of people who sleep in full moonlight,
and that moonlight affects linen clothes
which are exposed to it.
Peasants know how the moon acts
upon fields of cucumbers, melons,
cotton, etc., and even make the times
for the various kinds of sowing, planting,
and grafting, and for the covering of the
cattle depend upon the course of the
moon. Lastly, astronomers know that
météorologie occurrences depend upon
the various phases through which the
moon passes in her revolutions.

DIAMONDS AND THE EAGLE
Al-Biruni related the story of
the eagle which collected dia¬
monds. Many similar legends
describing how precious gems
were obtained in this way
flourished in the East. A num¬
ber were recorded In the
"Thousand and One Nights", and
so reached the West, where
they inspired engravings such
as this, which appeared in
"Hortus Sanitatis", published at
Mainz, Germany, In 1491.
Many strange and unlikely tales are
told about diamond mines and the way
these precious stones are obtained. It
is said for example that the diamond is
called the eagle's stone. . The origin
of this name is that diamond prospec¬
tors are said to cover the nest in which
eaglets are lying with a piece of glass.
The eagle can see its young but, unable
to reach them, it goes in search of
diamonds, which it places on top of the
glass. When a goodly number have
been deposited, the prospectors purloin
them, then remove the glass, so deceiv¬
ing the eagle into believing that it
has regained its young thanks to fetch¬
ing the diamonds. The glass is then
replaced, and the eagle flies off in
search of more gems.

THE GREAT ART
OF THE HINDUS
In every place to which some particu¬
lar holiness is ascribed, - the Hindus
construct ponds intended for the ab¬
lutions. In this they have attained to
a very high degree of art, so that our
people (the Muslims), when they see
them, wonder at them, and are unable
to describe them, much less to construct
anything like them. The Hindus build
them of great stones of an enormous
bulk, joined to each other by sharp and
strong cramp-irons, in the form of steps
(or terraces) like so many ledges; and
these terraces run all around the pond,
reaching to a height of more than a
man's stature. On the surface of the
stones between two terraces they con¬
struct staircases rising like pinnacles.
Thus the first steps or terraces are like
roads (leading round the pond) and the
pinnacles are steps (leading up and
down). If ever so many people descend
to the pond whilst others ascend, they
do not meet each other, and the road
is never blocked up, because there are
so many terraces, and the ascending
person can always turn aside to another
terrace than that on which the descend¬
ing people go. By this arrangement all
troublesome thronging is avoided.

THE PROPERTIES
OF CHINESE TEA
It is said that chah is a Chinese
word and Is meant for a herb which
grows at high altitudes there. It also
grows in Katha and Nepal. Several
varieties of it are distinguished on the
basis of its colour: some are white,
while the others are green, violet, grey
and black.
White tea is the most excellent variety
of the herb; its leaf is slender and
fragrant, and exerts its effect on the
body comparatively more swiftly than
all the other varieties. It is rare and
not easily available, followed with regard
to availability by the green, violet, grey
and black varieties.
The people (of China and Tibet) cook
it, and preserve it In a cube-shaped
vessel after desiccating it. Tea has the
characteristics of water but is especially
benefical in overcoming the influence
of tippling. For this reason it is taken
to Tibet where people habitually quaff
considerable quantities of wine, and
there Is no better médecine for negating
the effect of liquor than this herb.
Those who transport it to Tibet accept
nothing in barter but musk.

In the book, Akhbar al-Sln it has
been stated that thirty bags of tea cost
a dirham, and its taste is sweet coupled
with sourness. On boiling, however,
the sourness disappears.
The people (of China and Tibet) drink
it. It is said that they drink it with
hot water and believe it to be a chola-
gogue [promoting the flow of bile] and
blood purifier. A person who travelled
to the place of its occurrence in China
has stated that the king of that country
resides in the city of Yanju. A big
river like the Tigris traverses this city.
Both sides of the river are studded
with wine sellers' tenements, kilns and
shops. People flock there to drink tea,
and do not take Indian cannabis clan¬
destinely. The king of the place receives
the capitation tax, and the public cannot
transact the sale of tea, since both
tea and wine are in the possession of
the king. He who transacts business
in salt and tea without the king being
aware of it is awarded the punishment
due to a thief.
Profits from such places go to the
coffers of the king and such profits
equal those accruing from gold and
silver mines. Some physicians have
mentioned in their pharmacopoeia that
tea Is the plant produced in China. The
people of that country make tablets
from it and take them to foreign lands.
These pharmacopoeia also describe
the origin of tea. A Chinese king became
displeased with one of his courtiers
whom he exiled from the city in the
direction of the mountains. The cour¬
tier was seized by a fever, and one
day he trudged, in a desperate state,
towards the mountain valleys. He was
being gnawed by hunger, and he saw
only tea plants, whose leaves he ate.
After a few days, his fever began to
abate. He continued eating tea leaves
till he recovered completely.
Another courtier happened to pass
that way. He saw the courtier who
had made this remarkable recovery,
and informed the king about it. The
king was surprised and he recalled
the exiled courtier and enquired from
him the reason for his recovery. The
courtier then narrated the remarkable
medicinal properties of tea.
The king thereupon ordered that tea
should be tested, and his physicians
enumerated its advantages to him. They
also began to incorporate tea in
medicines.

THE LODESTONE
Like amber, the lodestone has the
property of attraction. But It renders
greater service, because it can draw
a blade from a wound, the point of a
lancet from a vein or a metal ring
swallowed and lying In the stomach.
According to Dioscorides, the best lode-
stones are the colour of lapis lazuli.
When burnt, the lodestone becomes red
Ironstone. Yet, we have never seen
this stone and no one has described it
to us. In an anonymous work, it is said
that the best lodestone Is a reddish
black, followed by lodestone the colour
of fire. Some say that the most sought
after lodestone Is more plentiful in the
Zabtara region, on the eastern confines
of the Roman Empire, than anywhere
else on earth.
It is said also that the hulls of ships
built for crossing the Arabian Gulf are
bound with palm fibres threaded through
holes drilled in the planks, while the
boards of ships sailing on the Medi¬
terranean are secured with iron nails.
The avoidance of nails in the former
case is explained by the presence of
hidden lodestone reefs in the Gulf,
which could constitute a grave danger
for ships built with iron fixings. This
is a far-fetched argument, however,
because the ships that cross the Ara¬
bian Gulf cannot dispense with anchors
and are always laden with Iron imple¬
ments, notably weapon blades from
India.

WHY THE EARTH IS ROUND
As concerns the curvature of the
Earth in the directions between longi¬
tude and latitude, it may be ascertain¬
ed by means of the longest days in
the towns we have mentioned. Let us
consider, for instance, the town of Bul-
gar, in the far north, and the town
of Aden, lying far to the south of it.
In and around Aden, the length of the
longest day is little more than twelve
hours, whilst in Bulgar it is little less
than seventeen hours. There is a dif¬
ference of two hours between the hours
of sunrise and sunset in those two
towns. Consequently, at the time of
sunrise over Aden, the Sun has already
risen to a height of two hours' travel
in the sky over Bulgar.
Thus, In summer, an observer in Bul¬
gar looking In the direction of the sun¬
rise or sunset sees a part of the sky
corresponding to that magnitude, whilst
the same part of the sky is not visible
in Aden, being situated In a circle be¬
neath the very Pole. Similarly, a part
of the sky of similar magnitude is visi¬
ble at sunrise and sunset In winter, when
it is not visible in Bulgar.
This being the case, we may assert
that a line traced on the Earth in the
direction of latitude, that is to say a
meridian, must of necessity be either
straight, or a concave or convex curve.
As regards the probability of its being
a straight line... the facts themselves
refute such a hypothesis, so that the
surface of the Earth cannot be flat in
this direction. As to the meridian being
concave, if It were, the height of the
Pole, that is to say the number of
stars permanently visible in the far
south, would diminish as the obser¬
ver moved northwards, becoming fewer
and fewer the further north he went.
In fact, the opposite occurs, the number
of such stars becoming greater, which
implies the convexity of the meridian
and hence the curvature of the Earth.
Thus the Earth is round in this direc¬
tion too, and if the same is true both
in the directions of latitude and longi¬
tude, then the Earth's surface must be
spherical.
Moreover, mountains, however high
they may be, do not alter this shape,
since they are small In comparison with
the whole and are mere wrinkles which
detract from the smoothness of its sur¬
face but not from the roundness of
the whole.
If the observer still harbours certain
doubts and thinks that this curvature
is characteristic only of the inhabited
parts of the Earth but not Its other
parts... let us turn for confirmation to
another argument, the Earth's shadow...
If an object Is round, its shadow Is
round, if it Is triangular its shadow
is triangular, if square then square, if
oblong oblong, and so forth with other
shapes.
When we observe an object casting
a shadow upon the Moon, we see that
its edges are rounded, especially near
the fullest point of the eclipse when
we may see most of the circumference
of the object casting the shadow and
the roundness of the object, thus con¬
cluding that the Intersection of the part
of the Earth illuminated by the Sun and
the part casting the shadow ¡s a cir¬
cle... Since such intersections are nu¬
merous, corresponding in number to the
number of observations and since they
concern different parts of the Earth,
yet all have this in common, that they
all throw a rounded shadow upon the
Moon, there can be no doubt as to
the shape of the Earth, which is Indeed
confirmed to be rounded on all sides.

THE CAPRICIOUS
TURQUOISE
We have ceased to prize the turquoise
since it changes rapidly with changes
In the skies, as they clear or are cover¬

of the wind. Further, perfumes diminish
the brillance of the turquoise, toilet water
attacks its lustre and unguents dull it
completely. For these reasons the tur¬
quoise does not rank as a precious
stone. It Is thought to come from a
"mud which has petrified". It may be

INDIA WAS ONCE A SEA
... If you have seen the soil of India
with your own eyes and meditate on
its nature if you consider the rounded
stones found in the earth however
deeply you dig, stones that are huge
near the mountains and where the
rivers have a violent current; stones
that are of smaller size at greater
distance from the mountains, and where
the streams flow more slowly; stones
that appear pulverized in the form of
sand where the streams begin to stag¬
nate near their mouths and near the
sea if you consider all this, you can
scarcely help thinking that India has
once been a sea which by degrees has
been filled up by the alluvium of the

WITCHCRAFT AND SCIENCE
We understand by witchcraft, making
by some kind of delusion a thing appear
to the senses as something different
from what it is in reality. Taken in
this sense, it is far spread among peo¬
ple. Understood, however, as common
people understand it, as the producing
of something which is impossible, it Is
a thing which does not lie within the
limits of reality. For as that which Is
impossible cannot be produced, the
whole affair is nothing but a gross
deception. Therefore witchcraft In this
sense has nothing whatever to do with
science.
One of the species of witchcraft is
alchemy, though it is generally not called
by this name. But if a man takes a
bit of cotton and makes It appear as
a bit of gold, what would you call this
but a piece of witchcraft? It is quite
the same as if he were to take a bit
of silver and make It appear as gold,
only with this difference, that the latter
is a generally-known process, I. e. the
gilding of silver, the former Is not.
The Hindus do not pay particular
attention to alchemy, but no nation is
entirely free from it, and one nation has
more bias for it than another, which
must not be construed as proving
intelligence or ignorance; for we find
that many Intelligent people are entirely
given to alchemy, whilst ignorant people
ridicule the art and its adepts. Those
intelligent people, though boisterously
exulting over their make-believe science,
are not to be blamed for occupying
themselves with alchemy, for their
motive is simply excessive eagerness
for acquiring fortune and for avoiding
misfortune.

25 WAYS TO FREEDOM
According to the Hindu philosophers,
liberation is common to all castes and
to the whole human race, if their inten¬
tion of obtaining it is perfect. This view

twenty-five elements of existence)
thoroughly. Then you may follow
whatever religion you like; you will no

THE GEOMETRY OF FLOWERS
Among the peculiarities of the flowers
there is one really astonishing fact, viz.
the number of their petals, the tops of
which form a circle when they begin
to open, is in most cases conformable
to the laws of geometry. In most cases
they agree with the chords that have
been found by the laws of geometry,
not with conic sections.
You scarcely ever find a flower of
7 or 9 petals, for you cannot construct
them according to the laws of geometry
in a circle as isosceles (triangles). The
number of their petals, is always 3 or 4
or 5 or 6 or 18. This is a matter of
frequent occurrence. Possibly one may
find one day some species of flowers
with 7 or 9 petals, or one may find
among the species hitherto known such
a number of petals; but, on the whole,
one must say nature preserves Its
genera and species such as they are.
For If you would, for example, count
the number of seeds of one of the
(many) pomegranates of a tree, you
would find that all the other pomegra¬
nates contain the same number of
seeds as that one the seeds of which
you have counted first. So, too, nature
proceeds in all other matters.
Frequently, however, you find in the
functions (actions) of nature which it is
her office to fulfil, some fault (some
irregularity) ... I, however, do not call
them "faults of nature", but rather a
superfluity of material beyond the due

AN AGE OF IMITATORS
The most important requirement of
medicine is that the man of medicine
should examine the terms of reference
as regards natural science and should
be fully acquainted with the natural
laws. When he comes to the resolution
of the ingredients of a drug every medi¬
cinal ingredient is arrayed in a different
aspect before him and each one has
properties that argue differently. This
is what the art of pharmacy should
achieve, but alasl ours is an age of

In his treatise on precious
stones, al-Biruni wrote, "I used
to have a disc of onyx, on
which wavy lines formed the
perfect figure of a duck, the
legs being invisible as if it was
swimming or sitting on its eggs;
the representation was faultless,
as if done by a skilful artist"
This figured onyx shows not a
duck but a fish. It Is part of
the private collection of the
writer Roger Caillois, of the
Académie Française.
LAWS OF NATURE
. . . The bees kill those of their kind
who only eat, but do not work in their
beehive.
Nature proceeds in a similar way;
however, It does not distinguish, for its
action is under all circumstances one
and the same. It allows the leaves and
fruit of the trees to perish, thus pre¬
venting them from realizing that result
which they are intended to produce in
%&$&
the economy of nature. It removes
them so as make room for others.
If thus the earth is ruined, or is near
to be ruined, by having too many
inhabitants, its ruler for it has a ruler,
and his all-embracing care is apparent
in every single particle of it sends it
a messenger for the purpose of reducing
the too great number and of cutting
away all that is evil.

THE NATURE OF TIME
Some people maintain that time
consists of cycles, at the end of which
all created beings perish, whilst they
grow at their beginning; that each such
cycle has a special Adam and Eve of
its own, and that the chronology of this
cycle depends upon them. Other people,
again, maintain that in each cycle a
special Adam and Eve exist for each
country in particular, and that hence the
difference of human structure, nature,
and language is to be derived.
Other people, besides, hold this
foolish persuasion, viz that time has no
terminus a quo at all.
Now, personal observation alone, and
conclusions inferred therefrom, do not
prove a long duration of the human life,
and the huge size of human bodies, and
what else has been related to be beyond
the limits of possibility. For similar
matters appear in the course of time
in manifold shapes. There are certain
things which are bound to certain times,
within which they turn round In a certain
order, and which undergo transfor¬
mations as long as there is a possibility
of their existing. If they, now, are not
observed as long as they are in
existence, people think them to be im¬
probable, and hasten to reject them as
altogether impossible.
This applies to all cyclical occurrences,
such as the mutual impregnation of
animals and trees, and the forthcoming
of the seeds and their fruits. For, if it
were possible that men did not know
these occurrences, and then were led
to a tree, stripped of its leaves, and
were told what occurs to the tree of
getting green, of producing blossoms
and fruits, etc., they would certainly
think it improbable, till they saw it with
their own eyes. It Is for the same
reason that people, who come from
northern countries, are filled with ad¬
miration when they see palm-trees,
olive-trees, and myrtle-trees, and others
standing in full-bloom at wintertime,
since they never saw anything like It in
their own country.
Further, there are other things
occurring at times In which no cyclical
order Is apparent, and which seem to
happen at random. If, then, the time
In which the thing occurred has gone
by, nothing remains of it except the
report about it. And if you find In such
a report all the conditions of authenticity,
and if the thing might have already
occurred before that time, you must
accept it, though you have no Idea of the
nature nor of the cause of the matter
in question.

PARABLE OF THE
FOUR PUPILS
A man Is travelling together with his
pupils for some business or other
towards the end of the night. There
appears something standing erect before
them on the road, the nature of which
it is impossible to recognize on account
of the darkness of night. The man
turns towards his pupils, and asks them,
one after the other, what it is. The
first says: "I do not know what it is." The
second says: "I do not know, and I have
no means of learning what it is." The
third says "It is useless to examine
what it is, for the rising of the day will
reveal it. If it is something terrible,
it will disappear at daybreak; if it is
something else, the nature of the thing
will anyhow be clear to us." Now, none
of them had attained to knowledge, the
first, because he was ignorant; the
second, because he was incapable, and
had no means of knowing; the third,
because he was indolent and acquiesced
in his ignorance.
The fourth pupil, howeyer, did not
give an answer. He stood still, and
then he went on In the direction of the
object. On coming near, he found that
it was pumpkins on which there lay a
tangled mass of something. Now he
knew that a living man, endowed with
free will, does not stand still In his
place until such a tangled mass Is
formed on his head, and he recognized
at once that It was a lifeless object
standing erect. Further, he could not
be sure if it was not a hidden place
for some dunghill. So he went quite
close to It, struck against it with his
foot till it fell to the ground. Thus all
doubt having been removed, he returned
to his master and gave him the exact
account.

SOLAR AND LUNAR YEARS
... People distinguish two kinds of
years the Solar year and the Lunar
year. They have not used other stars
for the purpose of deriving years from
them, because their motions are compar¬
atively hidden, and can hardly ever be
found out by eyesight; but only by astro¬
nomical observations and experiments...
The Solar Year. According to the
statement of Theon (1), In his Canon,
the people of Constantinople, and of
Alexandria, and the other Greeks, the
Syrians and Chaldaeans, the Egyptians
of our time... all use the solar year,
which consists of nearly 365 i days.
They reckon their year as 365 days, and
add the quarters of a day in every fourth
year as one complete day... This year

they call an intercalary year, because
the quarters are intercalated therein.
The ancient Egyptians followed the same
practice, but with this difference, that
they neglected the quarters of a day
till they had summed up to the number
of days of one complete year, which
took place in 1,460 years; then they
Intercalated one year.
The Persians followed the same rule
as long as their empire lasted; but they.,
treated it differently. For they reckoned
their year as 365 days, and neglected
the following fractions until the day-
quarters had summed up in the course
of 120 years to the number of days of
one complete month and until the fifth
parts of an hour, which, according to
their opinion, follow the fourth parts of
a day (i.e. they give the solar year the
length of 365 i days and 1/5 hour), had
summed up to one day; then they added
the complete month to the year in each
116th year.
The Luni-Solar Year. The Hebrews,
Jews, and all the Israelites, the Sâbians,
and Harrânians, used an intermediate
system. They derived their year from
the revolution of the sun, and its months
from the revolution of the moon with
this view, that their feast and fast days
might be regulated by lunar computation,
and at the same time keep their places
within the year. Therefore they inter¬
calated 7 months In 19 lunar years.

ON HINDU RELIGIONS
Everything which exists on this subject
[the religions of the Hindus] in our
literature is second-hand information
which one has copied from the other,
a farrago of materials never sifted by
the sieve of critical examination.
...I have written this book on the
doctrines of the Hindus, never making
any unfounded imputations against
those, our religious antagonists, and
at the same time not considering it
inconsistent with my duties as a Muslim
to quote their own words at full length
when I thought they would contribute to
elucidate a subject. If the contents of
these quotations happen to be utterly
heathenish, and the followers of the
truth, I. e. the Muslims, find them
objectionable, we can only say that such
is the belief of the Hindus, and that they
themselves are best qualified to
defend it.

THE WEAK FOUNDATIONS
OF ASTROLOGY
The art of astrology in general is
built upon weak foundations and its
deductions are Insubstantial. Its calcul¬
ations are confused and it is mostly
supposition rather than reliable know¬
ledge. The subject matter of astrology
consists of the various configurations
of heavenly bodies which are themselves
contingent on the chosen points on
the heavenly sphere itself or on a certain
relationship between that and the hori¬
zon. Astrology therefore can never
produce positive results since its very
basis is unreliable.
How indeed could it be reliable, when
the exact location of the object for
which the calculations are made and for
which the future is foretold by means
of horoscopes of "conjunctions" and
"oppositions" is unknown and when the
actual positions of these configurations
conflict with those which are used I

THE PERFUMER'S ART
Dari was a port in the old days where
scents and perfumes were unloaded
and therefrom perfumers went from
one city to another selling them, or
bought by the people of the Quraysh
tribe. The Quraysh possessed a
masterly expertise in this art. It Is
because of this that the Arabs call
apothecaries Dari. In the hadith the
Holy Prophet (peace be on Him) said:
"The example of a noble and sincere
person is like that of a Dari whose
perfumes, even if he does not give any
of them to you, will all the same have
their pleasant smell; and a bad com¬
panion is like an ironsmith who, even
though he may not singe you with the
sparks of his furnace will at least
harass you with its smoke."

THE DESALTING
OF WATER
People say that on the 6th [of January]
there is an hour during which all salt
water of the earth becomes sweet. All
the qualities occurring in the water
depend exclusively upon the nature of
that soil by which the water is enclosed,
if it be standing, or over which the water
flows, if it be running. Those qualities
are of a stable nature, not to be altered
except by a process of transformation
from degree to degree by means of
certain media. Therefore this statement
of the waters becoming sweet in this
one hour is entirely unfounded.
Continual and leisurely experimen¬
tation will show to any one the futility
of this assertion. For if the water were
sweet It would remain sweet for some
space of time. Nay, if you would
place in this hour or any other in a
well of salt water some pounds of pure
dry wax, possibly the saltiness of the
water would diminish. This has been
mentioned by the experimenters, who go
so far as to maintain that if you make
a thin vase of wax and place it ¡n sea
water, so that the mouth of the vase
emerges above the water, those drops
of water which splash over into the
vase become sweet.
If all salt water were mixed with so
much sweet water as would overpower
its nature, in that case their theory
would be realized (i.e. all salt waters
would become sweet). An example of
this process is afforded by the lake of
Tlnnis, the water of which is sweet in
autumn and winter in consequence of
the great admixture of the water of the
Nile, whilst at the other seasons it is
salt, because there is very little ad¬
mixture of Nile water.

QUALITIES OF ARABIC
All the arts of the world have been
transferred to the Arabic language; it
has penetrated deep into our hearts,
and its charms have crossed into
the innermost reaches of our being,
although to every people their own
language appears to be sweet, since
they use it day in, day out.
When I observe my language, I find
that if any art is rendered Into it, it
would look de trop and odd. On the
other hand, if the same art is rendered
Into Arabic, it would look natural and
good, even though Arabic does not
happen to be my mother tongue.

THE RUSE OF
ALEXANDER THE GREAT
Some say that the diamond was
brought by the Bicornutus (Alexander
the Great) from the valley of the dia¬
monds, a valley teeming with snakes.
Whoever set eyes on these reptiles
would instantly perish. The Bicornutus
advanced on the snakes with a mirror
carried by men who were hidden behind
it. When the snakes saw their reflec¬
tions, they died on the spot. Yet these
snakes had looked upon each other
without dying and the sight of the real
thing should have been more deadly
than the mere reflection.

AL-BIRUNI vs. AVICENNA
IN THE BOUT
OF THE CENTURY
Two geniuses aged 24 and 17
debate the nature of the universe
by
Seyyed Hossein Nasr
SEYYED HOSSEIN NASR, rector of Arya-
mehr University, in Teheran, is the author
of a remarkable study on al-Biruni, published
in his "An Introduction to Islamic Cosmo-
logical Doctrines" (Harvard University Press,
1964), in which he dealt with al-Biruni, Avi¬
cenna and Ikwan al-Safa. Professor of the
History of Science and Philosophy at Arya-
mehr University, he has devoted another
book to great Islamic scholars, "Three Mus¬
lim Sages" (Avicenna, Suhrawardi and Ibn
'Arabi) published by Harvard University Press.
Last year his "Al-Biruni end Ibn Sina - Ques¬
tions and Answers" was published by the
High Council of Culture and Art in Teheran.
Our text is abridged from the English
introduction to this work.
I|N the rich tradition of
Islamic intellectual history there are
several instances in which leading
thinkers have left in writing the
exchanges of ideas and debates which
they have carried out with each other
on the highest Intellectual level.
One of the most important is the
series of Questions and Answers
exchanged between al-Blruni and
Avicenna (Ibn Sina) in which Avicenna's
student Ma'sumi, also took part. This
series of exchanges stands as a peak
of Islamic intellectual history and a key
to the understanding of an aspect of
al-Biruni's thought not discussed
extensively in his other writings.
The Questions and Answers, include
ten questions pertaining to Aristotle's
De Cáelo (On the Heavens) and eight
other questions posed by al-Biruni
himself. These are answered by
Avicenna one by one. Then al-Blruni
once again responds to Avicenna's
answers, discussing eight of the first
ten and seven of the last eight
questions. Finally Ma'sumi answers
al-Biruni once again on behalf of
Avicenna.
There are then altogether two sets
of exchanges on some of the most
fundamental points of "natural phil¬
osophy" between al-Blruni, the "in¬
dependent" scientist and thinker, and
Avicenna the most eminent represen¬
tative of the Islamic Peripatetic (ma-

shsha'i) school, and one of his fore¬
most pupils, Abu Sa'id ibn Ali al-
Ma'sumi.
In one question al-Biruni criticizes
the reasons given in Aristotelian
natural philosophy for denying that the
celestial spheres have gravity or levity.
Al-Biruni does not reject the view of
Aristotle but criticizes the reasons
given to sustain such a view.
Moreover, he attacks the Aristotelian
thesis that circular motion is innate
to heavenly bodies, asserting that
although the heavenly bodies do move
in circular motion, such a motion could
be "forced" and accidental while the
motion natural to these bodies could
be straight.
Avicenna replies to these objections
along the lines of argument presented
in standard works of Aristotelian
natural philosophy.
In another question al-Biruni criticizes
Aristotle's over-reliance on the views
of the ancients and his oredecessors
concerning the conditions of the
heavens without relying upon his
own observation. Al-Biruni gives an
example of the Hindu description of
mountains which he says cannot be
relied upon because If one observes
them today one sees that they have
altered.
Avicenna reminds al-Biruni of the
difference between mountains which
undergo generation and corruption and
the celestial bodies which do not do so.
Furthermore, he accuses al-Biruni of
having learned this argument from
either John Philoponus, who was
opposed to Aristotle because he
himself was a Christian, or Mohammed
ibn Zakariyya' al-Razi, who according
to Avicenna should have remained
content with medicine and not meddled
in metaphysics, in which he had no
competence.
kL-BIRUNI criticizes the
Aristotelian denial of the possibility
of the existence of another world
completely different from the one we
know, and unknown to us because
it is completely veiled to our senses.
He cites as illustration the fact that
it is impossible for the person who
is born blind to conceive of vision.
In the same way there might be other
worlds for the perception of which
man does not have the necessary
faculties. Avicenna accepts the exist¬
ence of other worlds which differ from
this world but defends the Aristotelian
view that there cannot be another
world such as this with the same ele¬
ments and nature.
After these questions which are
related to Aristotle's De Cáelo, al-
Biruni poses eight other questions
himself related to natural philosophy.
Al-Biruni, for example, asks how
vision is possible. Why can we see
beneath water whereas water is an
opaque body which should reflect the
rays of light at its surface? Avicenna
states that according to Aristotle
vision results from the eye becoming
affected by the "qualities" of visible
colours contained in the air that is in
contact with it. According to this
theory the problem mentioned by al-
Biruni does not arise since both water
and air are transparent bodies that
can transmit the colours to the sense
of sight, thus making vision possible.
If there is no vacuum either inside
or outside this world, al-Biruni asks,
why is it that if the air within a flask
is sucked out water rises up in it?
Avicenna answers that this is not due
to a vacuum. Rather, a certain amount
of the air remaining in the flask
contracts as a result of the coldness
of the water causing the water to rise
within the flask.
If things expand through heating and
contract through cooling then why, al-
Biruni asks, does a flask full of water
break when the water within it freezes?
Avicenna believes that it is the air
which upon being cooled contracts,
almost causing a vacuum to be created
in the flask, and since that is not
possible, causing the flask to break.
Finally, al-Biruni queries, why does
ice float on water while its earthy parts
are more than water and it is therefore
heavier than water? Avicenna replies
that upon freezing ice preserves in its
internal spaces and lattices airy parts
which prevent it from sinking in water.
An examination of the questions
posed by al-Biruni reveals their vital
significance for the history of science.
In Islamic civilization the main school
of natural philosophy which served as
the immediate philosophical back¬
ground for most Muslim scientists was
the Peripatetic, itself a synthesis of
the views of Aristotle, his Alexandrian
commentators and certain elements of
later Neoplatonism. Avicenna in his
Peripatetic writings represents this
main current in its most mature form.
But there was also an anti-Aristo¬
telian current which is of much
importance for an understanding of
Islamic science, to which the questions
of al-Biruni belong. Some of the anti-
Aristotelian elements derived from
schools related to the Pythagorean-
Hermetic heritage of Antiquity such as
the writings of Jabir ibn Hayyan and
the Ikhwan al-Safa' while others issued
from the logical criticism of individual
philosophers and scientists such as
Mohammed ibn Zakariyya' al-Ra^i and
al-Biruni.
Al-Biruni's criticism of Peripatetic
natural philosophy is one of the
sharpest attacks on this dominant
school. It touches upon the most
difficult and thorny problems of Aristo¬
telian physics and for that reason
resembles some of the arguments
against this form of physics by
Renaissance and 17th century scientists
in the West, although the point of view QJ
of al-Biruni is ven' different from that Lm
of the Western critics of Aristotle.

LOST HORIZONS
IN THE
LAND OF POETRY
The vanished works
of a scientist
turned man of letters
by
Zabihollah Safa
I|T is sometimes difficult
to make a distinction between the
"scholar" and the "man of letters" of
Islamic civilization. In both the Arab
and the Persian worlds, the two
cornerstones of Islamic literature, it
frequently happens that great scholars
in the fields of philosophy, medicine,
natural history or mathematics are also
poets and men of letters.
In some cases they even put aside
their scientific preoccupations and set
about recounting or writing tales or
anecdotes. Philosophers and thinkers
such as Avicenna and al-Blruni, in the
11th century, and Suhrawardl In the
12th, have thus left behind them novels
and stories written in Arabic or In
Arabic and Persian.
Avicenna wrote two well-known
philosophical novels In Arabic, which
foreshadowed certain later Persian
works.
Islamic scholars found a welcome
source of diversion in writing poetry,
and there are very few Iranian scholars
who did not at some time or another
apply themselves to verse in Arabic
or Persian. One of the earliest among
them Is al-Farabl, some of whose
quatrains in Persian are still extant.
At a later date when scholars
versified to their heart's content, Avi¬
cenna became a prolific writer of verse
30
ZABIHOLLAH SAFA is the author of a book
on the life and works of al-Biruni. He is
president of the Iranian National Commission
for Unesco and professor of literature at the
University of Teheran. He has written several
works on Avicenna, and is now compiling
for Unesco an annotated bibliography in
Arabic and Persian on the writings of al-
Biruni. He also prepared, for Unesco's
Collection of Representative Works, the
"Anthologie de la Poésie Persane", published
by Editions Gallimard, Paris, in 1964.
in Arabic as well as Persian. Al-
Biruni, an author of serious scientific
works, also wrote poetry in Arabic,
and others, such as the great 12th cen¬
tury mathematician, philosopher and
doctor, Omar Khayyam, became so
well known for their literary work that
their names have been handed down
to posterity as poets rather than as
scholars.
These are but a few of the many
examples we could quote, for Arabic
and Persian literary history is rich in
such many-sided talents. At that
time the language of science was
Arabic, and the approach to any
scientific discipline necessarily invol¬
ved learning Arabic. In Irano-Arablc
schools the teaching of Arabic lan¬
guage and literature preceded all
other subjects; Arabic prose and
poetry were used as a means to enable
pupils to benefit from text books
written in Arabic, and students learned
by heart works of prose and verse
by leading writers and poets.
This meant that the student began
Islamic schooling with an introduction
to Arabic, which he continued to study
throughout his life, and which often
led him to an interest in literature, even
when his main preoccupation was the
rational study of a specific field of
science. So it is hardly surprising that
the great scientist-scholar al-Biruni
became interested In literature and
composed verses for his own pleasure.
Yaqut of Hama examined some of
al-Biruni's literary works in the library
at Marw (or Merv) shortly before the
Mongol invasion of Khorassan in the
13th century. The vestiges of Merv,
former capital of Khorassan, can still
be seen near the modern city of Mary
in the Soviet Turkmenistan Republic.
Yaqut's bibiography of al-Biruni
shows that the latter wrote a consi¬
derable number of literary and critical
works: among many others, an Arabic
etymology, commentaries on the poems
of the great Arabic poet Abi Tamman,
and even an anthology entitled " Selec¬
tion of Verse and Literary Works".
One of his most important works,
of a literary rather than a scientific
stamp, deals with his native region of
Khwarizm. Although this book was
widely known during the 11th and
12th centuries, it has since disap¬
peared. Fortunately, part of It is quoted
by the 11th century Persian writer-
historian Balaghl, and the fragment
which has reached us demonstrates
al-Biruni's scrupulous and Impartial
research into historical events, their
causes and their consequences.
The value of al-Biruni's work lies
in the vast scope of his knowledge,
which, particularly in respect to pre-
Islamic nations, was not shared by
his contemporaries. This is largely
due to his command of languages
Iranian, Arabic, Syriac and Sanskrit
were as familiar to him as Soghdian,
the language of his native Khwarizm.
He was also able to use Arabic
translations of works written In Greek
and Syriac.
Al-Biruni was of both a serious and
lighthearted turn of mind; perhaps his
penchant for humour and jokes was
a counterweight to the scientific rigour
of his studies. In his personal rela¬
tionships and in his conversation, as
his biographers have noted, he reveals
a pleasant open nature and a spirited
wit. Occasionally, he surprises his
readers by the use of earthy terms in
his poems.
It may have been this trait that led
him to translate or write a number of

Al-Biruni wrote several novels which unfortunately have not come down to us.
One of these, entitled The Two Idols of Bamian, is about two Buddhist statues,
of a man and a woman, carved from the face of a huge cliff of Bamian in
northwest Afghanistan. The now famous cliff is honeycombed with caves,
which provide a dramatic setting for numerous carvings and paintings. The
two colossal stone Buddhas, stand majestically in the shelter of the rock,
dominating the entire valley. Above, the smaller of the two (35 metres high).
The larger statue stands 53 metres high. The sculptures date from the 4th-5th

popular or folk romances while en¬
gaged In exacting scientific work. In
the inventory of his writings, which he
made when he was 65 years old, he
lists six novels, which have all unfor¬
tunately been lost. Works by other
authors and poets, however, record
passages from these novels, but it Is
not known whether they were written
in Arabic or in Persian.
The adventure of "Vamegh and
Azra", an ancient legend of Greek
origin which found its way Into Pahlavi
literature, is a love story. Onsori, a
poet of the time, seems to have used
this as a source of inspiration for his
own poetic work, "Vamegh and Azra";
it was at a much later date that several
other poets put this tale Into verse.
It Is worth noting here that the story
also entered Persian literature through
pseudo-Callisthenes' novel on Alexan¬
der the Great
Qassim al-sorur wa'ayn al-hayat is
another tale put into verse by Onsori.
It has never been clearly established
whether the original was written by
Onsori or by al-Biruni, but neither
version exists today.
"Urmasdyar and Mehryar" is an old
story adapted by al-Biruni; the names
indicate that it is certainly of Iranian
origin.
"The Two Idols of Bamian", a folk
tale adapted by al-Biruni, Is about two
Buddhist statues, a man and a woman,
carved in the rock of a mountainside
at Bamian, near Balkh in northern
Afghanistan. The statues still exist
and the local people, believing that
they were two lovers who were turned
to stone, still recount their adventures
and the reason for their metamor¬
phosis. The story was also put Into
verse by Onsori, under the title "The
Red Idol and the White Idol". This
story, like that of "Dadmeh and Gera-
midokht", has also disappeared. "Ni-
nufar" (water Illy), the last of these
works appears to have been a tale of
Hindu origin.
The six titles clearly demonstrate al-
Biruni's interest in legend;, it is unfor¬
tunate that they should have been
lost, for they would have provided
excellent material for analysis. From
the narrative skill and descriptive
power al-Biruni displays in his various
works, especially when dealing with

LOST HORIZONS (Continued)
history which in Islamic civilization is
a part of literature.
It is interesting to note that both
Arabic, the scientific language of Islam,
and Persian, were greatly enriched by
the contributions of the major scholars
of Iranian origin and of the Islamic
civilization within the Iranian cultural
sphere living at the beginning of this
civilization (between the late 8th cen¬
tury and the end of the 12th century).
This was brought about firstly by the
addition of many words, phrases,
explanations and expressions from
Greek, Syriac, Pahlavi and Hindu, with
a few minor changes In pronunciation;
secondly, by the translation of scien¬
tific expressions and terminology; and
finally, by the invention of turns of
phrase or expressions using the rules
and the flexibility of Arabic and Persian
grammar.
The debating skill of such scholars
as al-Biruni, Avicenna, Suhrawadi,
among others, contributed greatly to
the elucidation of many concepts in the
field of philosophy and disputation in
the Arabic and Persian languages.
Al-Biruni was one of the master-
artisans of this enrichment.
What differentiates him especially is
his knowledge of Sanskrit and Syriac,
Greek texts and ancient* Iranian sour¬
ces, by virtue of which he introduced
a considerable number of words,
expressions and turns of phrase Into
the Arabic and Persian languages.
His Pharmacology gives ample evi¬
dence of this. In this work each
drug is named ¡n Persian (Pahlavi),
Arabic, Greek, Syriac and Sanskrit,
and sometimes even in local dialects
of the Iranian plateau, together with
directions for its use. Its composition
and cases where its use would be
harmful, written in Arabic. This book
alone would suffice to establish al-
Biruni's contribution to the enrichment
of Arabic (see following article).
The same considerations apply to
the only book of his which is written
in Persian and which is still extant,
namely the Astrology, where his
terminology shows extensive use of
Sanskrit and Pahlavi sources.
Al-Biruni's literary work adds a
particularly engaging aspect to his
complex genius. It presents an In¬
exhaustible field of linguistic research,
which Iranologists have now begun to
investigate.
At the start of the present century
Carra de Vaux, the French orientalist,
wrote in his basic study "Thinkers of
Islam": "Like other great thinkers of
the more recent past, a Leonardo da
Vinci or a Leibniz, al-Biruni combines
the most varied talents. Philosopher,
historian, traveller, linguist, scholar and
poet, mathematician, astronomer and
geographer, he has left his mark in all
these spheres . . . spanning the gap of
time, he is a figure whose youthfulness
strikes us today; it is as though he
stands out and breaks away from his
own era and comes to meet us."
Zabihollah Safa
'FATHER' OF
ARABIC PHARMACY
IN MEDIEVAL
ISLAM
by Hakim Mohammed Said
I ORE than nine hundred
years have passed since al-Biruni
wrote his Book on Pharmacy (the Kitab
al-Saydanah, or Saydalah), a work that
has rightly earned him the title of
Father of Arabic Pharmacy in medieval
Islam.
Today the science of medicine Is
characterized by disciplines unknown
in al-Biruni's age. A proper appraisal
of al-Biruni's work can, therefore, only
be made by referring to his age and
its standards.
Lest It be understood that al-Biruni's
book is concerned with the aetiology
of diseases and their treatment, it must
be made clear that this is by no
means the case. In fact, it is a
treatise on materia medica, patterned
somewhat on the Ist century A.D.
treatise of the Greek physician Dios-
corides, which lists 600 medicinal
plants.
But al-Biruni sets forth five times
as many medicinal plants as Diosco-
rides, although he makes the latter the
main source on which to base his
discussion of the drugs. It has,
however, been said that the description
of the drugs, given by Dioscorides, is
so vague as to make most of them,
with the exception of about a hundred
drugs, unidentifiable today. It is rather
HAKIM MOHAMMED SAID, a medical doctor
of Pakistan, is president of the Hamdard
National Foundation, Karachi. This founda¬
tion, devoted to scientific and medical
research, has ¡ust published "Al-Biruni's Book
on Pharmacy and Materia Medica" (two
volumes, Karachi, 1973), the first translation
into English of the complete text of al-Blruni's-
Pharmacology". Dr. Said was the organizer
of the AI-Birunl International Congress, held
in Karachi, last November.
interesting to see how al-Blruni over¬
came the problem.
One of the advantages that al-Biruni
enjoyed was his command over both
Persian and Arabic and his own
Khwarizmian dialect. He lived on the
fringe of the Iranian mainland, and had
an intimate knowledge of Persian
customs and traditions, and, since most
of his extant works are in Arabic, felt
even more at home with the Arab
background, although he never visited
the Arab part of the world.
The procedure that he commonly
adopts with regard to the description
of a drug is that he first discusses it
under its Arabic name, and then
examines its equivalents in other
languages, finally establishing its iden¬
tity. For example, if a drug is known
as hum al-majus in Arabic and arzad
maghushi in Syriac, the probability is
that it is the same drug, that is, the
Magian plant, which is today known
by the botanical name of Ephedra
pachyclada from which the alkaloid,
ephedrin, is extracted.
Primarily a geodesist, geographer,
mathematician and historian, during the
course of his sojourn in Afghanistan
and north India, he studied the customs
of different people at close quarters.
In short, he was a polymath who aimed
at what is known in Arabic as takhrij
(extraction of the essence). One
cannot say that he was as much of
a rationalist in science as the Egyptian
scientist Ibn al-Haytham (he was not);
nevertheless, he knows how to sift the
grain and separate it from the chaff.
One may smile today on reading
that, after the hatching of the eggs
of the timsah (skink lizard), the off¬
spring either make their way to the
river and become crocodiles, or remain
on land and become skink lizards.

Al-Biruni has rightly
been called the Father
of Arab Pharmacy in
medieval Islam. In his
"Book on Pharmacy
and Materia Medica",
he laid down the credo
that pharmacy was an
independent entity from
medicine and "the first
step in the hierarchy

ARABIC PHARMACY (Continued)
But al-Biruni who had never been to
Egypt, to which the skink lizard Is
indigenous, describes what he has
been told by the earlier masters, and,
after describing this, he comes to the
ecology of the skink lizard, how it is
obtained, its medicinal usages,, and
substitutes.
There are also priceless gems of
information scattered throughout the
text of the Kitab al-Saydanah. Al-
Biruni's is among the first detailed
descriptions of tea, telling us that tea
was taxed in China (see Anthology
page 22). His is the first description
of the plant, faghirah (Zanthoxyllum
species) which he describes as coming
from Sufalah, the present-day Sangla
Hill in Pakistan. This shows how the
horizon of the Arabic materia medica
was widening to embrace new drugs
from the Indo-Paklstan Subcontinent,
Iran, Afghanistan, and other regions.
It amply shows, too, that what he was
writing was not merely a piece of
compilation but bears the stamp of an
original mind.
Let us give a concrete example of
his approach. The winter truffle is
known in Arabic as urjun qabal, and
faswat al-dab. While describing this
variety of the mushroom, al-Blruni says:
"When tender, fresh, and lush, It is
cooked for food as any other edible
mushroom. But when it dries, the top
scatters away leaving what looks like
the Ceylon cornet tree which gives
the mushroom its name ... It shoots
out of the ground In a rectangular
shape, like a white stick with a top . . ."
Maimonides, the famous Jewish
philosopher and rabbi, wrote his
Exegesis of Drugs much later than
al-Biruni. He holds Usan al-kalb (the
hound's tongue) to be lisan al-hamal
(Plantago major), belonging to the
Plantaginaceae family. Al-Biruni, on
the other hand, holds It to be a
Cynoglossum species, and he is
correct, for the name given by him is

of a work by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century A.D.) on the healing
qualities of plants. The Persian text of this bilingual (Arabic-Persian) manuscript
is richly illustrated with drawings of animals and plants, rendered with a grace and
in colours typical of Persian art, though sometimes scientific accuracy gives way
to poetic fancy. Above stylized drawings of two medicinal plants: the bitter-sweet
nightshade (top) a climbing plant with red berries; the highly poisonous henbane

emollient for earaches and, with vinegar and rose oil, relieves toothache. Similarly,
its seeds and root, cooked in vinegar or oil, act as analgesics for the pains descri¬
bed above. ..Excessive eating of its leaves results in the loss of senses..." According
to Avicenna, "those who eat henbane begin to bray like a donkey and whinny like
ahorse." Left, from the same 15th century Persian manuscript, a treatment for

a direct translation of the Greek word.
Although he did not know Latin for
he always equates Rome with the
Byzantine Empire and Greek, al-
Biruni's transcription of Greek names
is generally scrupulously correct.
Al-Biruni's book of pharmacy offers
a view of several new tendencies which
were crystallizing during the 10th-
11th century Muslim world:
The vague notion of the binomial
notation which is at the very heart of
the Linnaean system. For example, in
the Linnaean notation a species is
described by means of its genus and
its specific characteristic, after the
name of the discoverer, or its location,
e.g., Rosa damascena (that is, the
damask rose of Damascus). In a
similar manner, al-Biruni describes the
maiden-hair fern as sh'ar al-juyad (the
hair of the giant). The description of
sh'ar al-juyad is followed by that of
sha'ar al-ghul, also a fern and known
as Onychlum japonicum in botanical
parlance. This tendency is rather
vague in al-Blruni, but he resorts to it
wherever possible.
The ethnography of plants. AI
Biruni describes different plants and
their occurrence In relation, wherever
possible, to the folklore associated
with them. When he calls a certain
drug Roman or Persian, he does not
mean that the drug is only In use In
those countries but that It has
originated there.
Drug substitution. In this field
al-Biruni has been very liberal In
providing the names of substitute
drugs in case the drug described Is
not available. He had little leeway,
however, for originality here since the
workings and active principles of drugs
as we understand them today were
not known in his day, and even the
application of some rule of thumb
would not have been possible.
A critical appraisal of al-Biruni's
materia medica would also demand an
examination of the shortcomings of the
treatise. Al-Biruni rarely describes
the Galenic properties of drugs and
even when he discusses poly-pharma¬
ceuticals he hardly ever describes how
they are prepared.
Most of such descriptions are copied
from earlier texts. Sometimes he
simply indulges in etymological exer¬
cises as In his descriptions of the
excreta of different animals. For
example, an Interesting account of the
dolphin is given but not its medicinal
relevance. At times he is so irrelevant
that he makes one laugh. To quote
one such example, he says that the
excrement of the dog is ironically
called dawa-l-kabir (i.e. panacea) in
Persian!
All the same, al-Blruni's materia
medica provides us with a picture of
the expanding materia medica of the
time; of the Muslim approach In general
to science; how the Muslim Weltan-

ARABIC PHARMACY (Continued)
schauung was embracing an enlarging
world-picture supported by a Greek
base which was being gradually dug
out and replaced by a new one; and
as a bridgehead to modern science.
Perhaps the finest materia medica
of all times, ¡ami Mufradat al-Adwiyah
wa'l Aghdhiyah (A Definitive Treatise
on Medicinal and Nutritional Simples)
was written two hundred years after
al-Biruni's death by Diya al-Din Ibn
Baytar Mulaghi, one of the Hispano-
Arabs, who quotes al-Biruni as one of
his sources while elucidating the occur¬
rence and properties of the drugs.
Since al-Biruni wrote or rather
dictated the book during the ebb-time
of his life, identical drugs are described
in different parts of the work. Also,
while citing authorities, he does not
generally specify the works from which
the passages are taken. He seems to
have been a man of strong dislikes:
Avicenna (Ibn Sina) is not mentioned
at alll He also holds Abu Bakr Zaka-
riya al-Razi generally conceded to be
one of the greatest clinicians of all
times in scant respect, although he
draws upon him with recurring fre¬
quency. Succeeding generations have
noted this fact, and one famous
historian, Ibn abi 'Usaybi'ah, the Syrian
chronicler, has particularly written on
this aspect of al-Biruni.
On the other hand, al-Biruni held the
Greeks in the highest respect, although
his acquaintance was greater with the
Jatter-day masters. He mentions the
philosopher Theophrastus only oc¬
casionally and Aristotle mostly when
referring to the pseudo-Aristotelian
treatise on the magical and talismanic
properties of certain stones. Galen is
mentioned comparatively less frequent¬
ly, as he was more a physician than
an exponent of the materia medica.
Occasionally al-Blruni commits real,
howlers: thus ambrosia (ambrosiya) Is
held to be a plant)
But, as I have stated earlier, al-
Biruni was not a physician; at best he
could be called a dilettante in so far
as medicine was concerned. And yet,
when he describes the mandrake plant,
the marking nut, balsam, the poppy,
the Iris, the aloes, he writes with the
ease of a master. Very rarely in a
book of materia medica have minerals
been described in such delightful
detail, and here he is at both his worst
and best. For he does his best to
extricate himself from the prison of
traditionalism and one can well see
that he goes more to the Greek sources
here than to the oriental ones, tradition-
fraught as the latter were.
Among the animal drugs, his des¬
criptions of the civef cat and the
beaver are among the best. One also
gets the impression that, even while
traversing the beaten path, al-Biruni
would like to ferret out something new,
something not known to the ordinary
man in the street. ;
Thus the impression that this book
leaves, along with his other pieces like
the Qanun al-Mas'udi (his great work
on astronomy), the Kitab al-Hind (his
book on India), and Athar al-Baqiyah
(The Chronology of Ancient Nations) is
that of a man writing at breakneck
speed to communicate his own learning
to his contemporaries and posterity,
a fantastically industrious being, rather
vain, egotistical, but self-effacing, ever
keen to gain more and more know¬
ledge, ready to scrutinize the different
hypotheses without bias and arrive at
his own opinion; of a man eager to
forswear narrow interests (he discards
Persian and accepts Arabic), not prone
to glossing over the foibles of his own
people he makes a devastating attack
on Dayfi Nam (Ten Names), the Persian
source book for medicinal synonyms
and holds it to be far inferior to the
Syriac Christian, Yashaq Samahi or
Chahar Nam (Four Names); of a man
determined to leave not a, single
moment of his life go to waste.
It should also be noted, that his age
was one of' disquisitions, argumen¬
tation, and internecine quarrels not
only between orthodoxy and hetero¬
doxy but between the four orthodox
Muslim schools of jurisprudence. Al-
Biruni seems to have been a liberal
orthodox Muslim who did not find it
necessary to condemn the other
schools of thought. A greater exponent
of live-and-let-live is rare to find. This
alone should be sufficient to place him
among the ranks of the really great.

MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN. "Two forms appear,
if it is cloven in the middle, and these are the male and
female human shapes." This is part of a long descrip¬
tion which al-Biruni gives of the mandrake root in his
treatise on pharmacy. Photo left, a striking example of
this strange root which might be taken for the statue
of a man, his hands clasped. The soporofic properties
of the mandrake have been known since ancient times.
It "brings about sleep after three to four hours",
observes al-Biruni. Above, Muslim doctors examining a
mandrake. Dioscorides, surgeon to Nero, used the man¬
drake as an anaesthetic in the 1st century A.D. The
Persian translation of his treatise contains an illustration
of the leaves and flowers of the plant (opposite page)
which corresponds exactly with the description that "the
flower resembles an actor's mask with a tongue protrud¬
ing from the open mouth". In the Middle Ages, the
mandrake was the subject of countless legends: it
was supposed to grow under the gallows, to shriek
when uprooted, and to be effective for all manner of
beneficent or evil purposes. A lively and profitable
trade in imitation mandrake roots flourished for cen¬
turies, with any sort of root carved in a human shape
being passed off as a mandrake. In fact the mandrake
is a close relative to the inoffensive and humble potato.

See biographical
Therefore the title of "philosopher"
(al-faylasuf) is usually reserved for
those who are masters of the doctrines
of one of these "philosophical"
schools. Considered in this light al-
Biruni has never been classified by
classical authors as a "philosopher",
nor associated with one of the well-
known schools of traditional Islamic
philosophy.
But If we understand philosophy in
its more general sense as logical and
rational discourse upon the nature of
things, then al-Blruni must certainly be
considered as a philosopher of note to
be studied for his significance In the
general context of Islamic Intellectual
history and also for the innate value
of his Intellectual vision.
Al-Biruni was a scientist, scholar,
compiler and philosopher for whom
the quest for knowledge was held as
the supreme goal of human life. He
respected knowledge in all its forms
and hence sought It wherever and In
whatever form possible. He saw In
knowledge an almost divine quality
very much in conformity with the fun¬
damental tenets of Islam.
Hence, al-Blrunl, with the universal
vision and the remarkable intellectual
qualities which he possessed, turned to
Greek as well as to Persian and Indian
sciences, to both the religious Islamic

sciences and the Intellectual ones. He
holds the rather unusual distinction of
being at once one of the greatest ma¬
thematicians and historians of hu¬
manity. And he wrote in nearly every
field, from astronomy to pharmacology.
But strangely enough, unlike his con¬
temporary scientist Ibn al-Haytham, al-
Biruni has not left behind independent
philosophical works of a systematic
nature. The only exception among his
extant works is the Questions and
Answers exchanged with Avicenna (Ibn
Sina), which deal with cosmological,
physical and philosophical problems
(see article page 27).
As for his lost works, he apparently
wrote several philosophical narratives,
including Qasim al-surur wa ayn al
haya and Ur-muzdvar wa Mihryar
which if found would be very signifi¬
cant, considering the importance of
this kind of philosophical narrative
romance in the writings of Avicenna,
Suhrawardi and many other Islamic
philosophers.
IIN order to understand al-
Biruni's philosophical thought, it is
therefore necessary to turn to his other
writings dealing with history, geography
or even astronomy, for in nearly all of
these works, one will find elements
dealing with philosophy, cosmology
and metaphysics interspersed within
the main scientific or historical discus¬
sion at hand.
In his encyclopaedic work, India, not
only does al-Biruni describe Indian
doctrines, but often comments upon
them and offers his own metaphysical
and philosophical Ideas and interpre¬
tations. In his Chronology of Ancient
Nations profound observations are
made about the nature of time and
the cycles of human history as well
as the origin of the order observed
In nature. In The Determination of the
Co-ordinates of Cities, the origin of
science and its classification are dis¬
cussed as are themes related to the
question of the origin and creation
of the universe.
One could go on In the same vein
with his other writings. Moreover, the
very fact that he chose to translate
into Arabic a work on Indian yoga such
as the Patanjali Yoga shows his intense
interest in metaphysical and spiritual
matters.
When all of these sources are ex¬
tracted and studied it becomes clear
that al-Biruni was neither a follower,
nor a member of any of the established
philosophical schools of his time.
The well known schools of "Islamic
philosophy" included the Peripatetic
(mashsha'i) (1), the Illuminationist (ish-
raqi) (2), and also that of theology
(kalam).
The most noteworthy aspect of al-
Biruni's philosophical views is his
strong and often original criticism of
Aristotelian philosophy, which is re¬
flected in the questions and answers
he exchanged with Avicenna and his
student Abdallah al-Ma'sumi.
Al-Biruni thus belongs to a series
of independent anti-Peripatetic thinkers
of the early period of Islamic history
who were also scientists, such men as
Mohammed Ibn Zakariyya'al - Razi,
whom al-Biruni both admired and cri¬
ticized.
Al-Biruni did not oppose all of the
teachings of Peripatetic philosophy en
bloc. Rather, basing himself on firm
religious faith in Islam on the one hand
and the tool of logic, rational analysis
and observation on the other, he refut¬
ed many of the theses of Peripatetic
philosophy, such as the eternity of the
world and the possibility of indefinite
division of matter.
What is important for an understand¬
ing of Islamic intellectual history is
that such a strong and rigorous criti¬
cism of Peripatetic thought did not
come from a rationalist, as was to
happen from the end of the Middle
Ages to the 17th century in the West,
but that it came from a man like al-Bi¬
runi who was deeply immersed in both
the life of faith and metaphysical and
cosmological doctrines of Islam and
other traditions.
It is of great significance for an
understanding of the reason for the
different paths that Islamic and Chris¬
tian civilization were to take at the end
of the Middle Ages that one of the
foremost critics of the Aristotelian
world view in Islam should also be the
person who introduced the Patanjali
Yoga to the Islamic world and one of
the Muslim figures really well-versed
In the Hindu Vedanta philosophy.
In questions of cosmogony and
creation, al-Biruni rejected violently the
Idea of the "eternity" of the world.
Like the Islamic theologians, he held
that to believe in the eternity of the
world is to negate the need for a
cause for the world and therefore to
negate indirectly Divine Unity, which
was the principle most dear to him.
In fact the whole of al-Biruni's works
can be interpreted as a quest for the
realization of unity in various forms of
knowledge and planes of existence. It
was most of all with the aim of preserv-
(1) Muslim school of philosophy influenced
by the philosophy of Aristotle.
(2) A philosophy with origins in Ancient
Persia, postulating inward spiritual enlighten¬
ment and mystical experience, and contrast¬
ing with the philosophy of Aristotle based
on reasoning and logical argument.
ing the inviolability of the doctrine of
unity that he criticized the Peripatetic
view of the eternity of the world In the
second of the questions he posed to
Avicenna.
The debate between al-Biruni and
Avicenna as well as al-Ma'sumi on this
subject concerns one of the most
important questions of Islamic philoso¬
phy, namely the condition under which
something needs a cause. Al-Biruni
identified the idea of the eternity of the
world with its not being created. For
him, in contrast to Avicenna, the "new¬
ness" of the universe implied its being
created and the denial of this "new¬
ness", or an acceptance that the world
does not have an origin in time, des¬
troyed the conception of creation and
ultimately the unity of the Creator and
his power. Hence In other works such
as The Determination of the Co-ordi¬
nates of Cities he affirmed his belief
in the created nature of the world and
tried to provide both scientific and
theological reasons for it.
As a result of his vast and varied
study of nature, history and various
traditional doctrines of time and of the
world, al-Biruni became clearly aware
of the qualitative nature of time, of the
fact that it is not uniformly stretched
out like a mathematical co-ordinate. He
also strongly denied the idea of uni-
formitarianism so dear to modern geo¬
logy and paleontology and provided
both scientific and philosophical argu¬
ments to disprove it.
B^ OR al-Biruni time has a
cyclic nature, but not in the sense of
returning to the same point again,
which is a metaphysical absurdity and
a modern caricature of the real tradi¬
tional teachings. Rather, by " cyclic "
al-Biruni understands qualitative chan¬
ges and correspondences between
various elements of time within each
cycle.
Without doubt his profound study
and intimate knowledge not only of the
Koranic conception of time, which is
based on cycles of prophecy, but also
of the teachings of the Puranas, the
18 Hindu epics, and of many other
traditions on the meaning of time and
history, helped al-Biruni develop per¬
haps more profoundly than any other
Islamic philosopher and scientist the
meaning of qualified and cyclic time
and Its implications for the study of
nature and of man.
A basic aspect of al-Biruni's thought,
which is closely related to his
treatment of time, concerns the dev¬
elopment and becoming of things, OQ
which many have by mistake identified ***»

of the traditional doctrine of grad¬
ation (3).
Al-Blruni was fully aware of the long
history of the earth, of the cataclysms
which changed mountains Into seas
and oceans into continents, of the
fact that certain species preceded
others on earth and that each species
has its own life cycle.
Pondering over the vast panorama
of nature In both time and space and
the teachings of various sacred writ¬
ings on the creation and subsequent
history of the Universe, al-Biruni
became aware of the basic principle
that the development and becoming of
things in this world is the gradual
unfolding and actualization of all the
possibilities that are inherent within
each being.
Nothing evolves from one form into
another as a result of external addi¬
tions or accretions; rather whatever
transformation does take place is no
more than the manifestations of pos¬
sibilities already present in that being.
In the same way, what becomes mani-

posed of an infinite series of forms ranging
in order from the barest type of existence
to ultimate perfection.
fested at a particular period of history
is no more than the unfolding of possi¬
bilities inherent 'in that particular cycle
of time.
This principle, which is one of the
cornerstones of al-Biruni's thought and
is a crystallization of well-known tradi¬
tional doctrines, is applied by al-Blruni
to his study of various domains of
nature, both animate and inanimate, as
well as to history and man.
Being an outstanding physicist, al-
Biruni was deeply interested in the
general principles of natural philoso¬
phy, in such questions as motion, time
and matter, as is again seen in his
criticism of Aristotelian natural philoso¬
phy presented in the series of ques¬
tions and answers exchanged with Avi¬
cenna.
As far as the nature of matter is
concerned, he sided with the Islamic
theologians.
It is somewhat strange that a scien¬
tist such as al-Biruni should support
the view of the theologians concerning
the structure of matter, for usually the
Muslim scientists believed in the conti¬
nuity of matter.
Of paramount importance for an
understanding of al-Biruni's philosophi-

cal ideas is his view of knowledge and
the methods used for Its attainment.
Al-Biruni held a view of knowledge
which was at once dynamic and static,
that Is, he believed clearly in the
gradual development of particular
forms of knowledge and at the same
time in the immutability of principial
knowledge derived from revelation.
In addition to being the founder of
the discipline of comparative religion
or the history of religion he must also
be considered as one of the founders
of the history of science. Yet, he
never lost sight of immutable know¬
ledge, which for him is always the
revealed Scriptures and which provides
the matrix for all the human sciences
which change and develop.
Moreover, al-Biruni was the great
champion of pure knowledge and its
value for the perfection of man. In
Islam there has never been the idea
of "science for science's sake" as is
found in the West. But within the
context of Islamic civilization al-Biruni
emphasized the importance of pure
knowledge and the pursuit of know¬
ledge for the sake of the perfection
of man as against those who stressed
the importance of its utility.

THE FIRST
MUSLIM
TO MAKE
A DEEP STUDY
OF HINDU
PHILOSOPHY
Left, 14th century Persian manuscript illus¬
tration shows Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna
crossing the Ganges, the sacred river to which
Indians go on pilgrimage (above), to pray
and meditate on its banks (opposite page).
Al-Biruni studied India at first hand during
his journeys in that country with Sultan
Mahmud. This permitted him to write his
monumental book on India. The breadth of
vision and depth of understanding he revealed
in this work were unprecedented in the
Muslim world of his day. It remains a model
of exact observation and objective analysis.
As George Sarton writes in his "Introduction
to the History of Science" "He was the first
Muslim to make a deep study of Hindu philo¬
sophy and became the most important link
between two great provinces of mankind,
India and Islam."

Of course, inasmuch as al-Biruni
spoke within the context of the tradi¬
tional world view, his defence of pure
knowledge and the view of those who
emphasized its utility met at the
highest level. For what can be more
"useful" to man than the knowledge
which is an adornment for his soul
and the means for Its attainment of
perfection?
Al-Biruni himself was aware of these
two poles and attitudes involved and
in his own writings combined the
pleasure aspect associated with the
attainment of knowledge with its aspect
of utility. For him the two were not
completely divorced from each other
but were complementary in the deep¬
est sense.
Al-Blruni never became the slave of
a particular method nor accepted that
kind of tyranny of methodology charac¬
teristic of so much of modern science.
He used different methods in different
sciences in conformity with the nature
of the science in question. Where it
was necessary he used induction, or
observation, or experimentation, or
deduction or had recourse to intellec¬
tual Intuition.
He was the most exact of scientists
without ever being fooled into believing
that the methods of experimental
science could he applied to the domain
of religion or the sciences of man. That
is why In al-Biruni, who in a sense
summarizes the whole history of Isla¬
mic science, there is no single method,
but methods for acquiring various
forms of knowledge in conformity with
the innate nature of the sciences in
question.
The basic significance of al-Blruni
for the modern world, and especially
the contemporary Islamic world, in fact,
is not only in that he was the father
of geodesy or that he weighed several
precious stones and metals carefully
or even that he criticized Aristotelian
natural philosophy profoundly. It is
above all in his success in being an
outstanding scientist, in being scienti¬
fic without being scientlstic. It is in
being logical without losing sight of the
spiritual empyrean, the knowledge of
which is not irrational nor illogical but
unattainable through logic and reason
alone.
It is also in his remarkable sense of
discernment which was able to give
each form of knowledge its due, to
assign to each element the place to
which it belonged by nature, so that
he could practise mathematics with
the rigour of the greatest of mathema¬
ticians and at the same time write of
human affairs with a vision that is
much more profound than the view
of those in the modern world who try
to ape the methods of the exact scien¬
ces in the field of the humanities and
who do not possess a fraction of
al-Biruni's scientific knowledge.
Al-Biruni stands as the model of the
thinker who was able to harmonize
within his own intellectual vision
various forms of knowledge, from the
sciences of nature to religion and phi¬
losophy.
He also stands as proof that it is
possible within a traditional world-
view to develop and even found
various branches of the sciences
without becoming enslaved by them
and without falling under the deadly
influence of belief in the unilateral and
tyrannizing power of science so preva¬
lent today, a belief whose end cannot
but be the stifling of the human spirit
and the destruction of the natural envi¬
ronment which itself serves as support
for man's terrestrial journey.

THE FORTRESS
OF NANDANA
In the Fortress of Nandana,
left, al-Biruni computed the
radius and circumference of
the earth in the year 1018.
The fortress stands in hilly
country about 100 kilometres
from Islamabad, capital of
modern Pakistan. Al-Biruni
explained his method In the
Mas'udic Canon. First he
calculated the height of a
neighbouring peak, possibly
the one seen here behind
the fortress, then he
measured the angle from
the summit to the earth's
horizon. His results were
amazingly accurate. H e
made the earth's radius
6,338.80 kilometres, com¬
pared with today's mean
figure of 6,370.98 kilometres
or 6,353.41 kilometres at the
latitude of Nandana, a dif¬
ference of barely 15 km.
Pioneer of scientific observation (continue* »om page w
42
He wrote of the great geological
changes which had occurred in the
remote past, long before the creation
of man, and also during human exis¬
tence, and some of his observations
are of great Interest. His discovery of
fossils of marine animals led him to
the conclusion that:
"Sea has turned into land and land
into sea; which changes, if they happen
before the existence of man, are not
known, and if they took place later they
are not remembered because with the
length of time the record of events
breaks, especially if this happens
gradually. This only a few can realize.
"This steppe of Arabia was at one
time sea, then was upturned so that
the traces are still visible when wells
or ponds are dug, for they begin with
layers of dust, sand and pebbles, then
there are found in the soii shells, glass
and bones which cannot possibly be
said to have been buried there on
purpose. Nay, even stones are
brought up In which are embedded
shells, cowries and what Is called
'fish-ears', sometimes well-preserved,
or the hollows are there of their shape
while the animal has decayed."
His interest next turned to the deter¬
mination of specific gravities, to vacuum
theory, the propagation of heat, the
dilatation of bodies and the reflection
and refraction of light. He even
attempted to establish a tentative
comparison between the speeds of
light and sound.
In a totally different field, we find
references in his works to the con
struction of a canal linking the Medi¬
terranean and the Red Sea, to the
desalination of sea water and even to
the atomistic theories of Democritus
Furthermore, and it is in this respect
that he really emerges as a precursor
of the great geniuses of the Renais¬
sance and the Enlightenment, he also
turned his attention to the human
sciences, in which his achievement is
quite extraordinary for someone living
in an age which was certainly not
noted for its tolerance.
By virtue. of his official post at the
court of Sultan Mahmud, al-Biruni was
required to take part in the Sultan's
campaigns. This did not prevent him
realizing his greatest wish, which was
to make contact with Indian thought.
The long periods which he spent in
India left an indelible impression upon
him, resulting in some of his most
remarkable works, in particular his
great work on India.
He went to India in the train of a
military conqueror, but it was in the
guise of a simple student that he
introduced himself to his Indian
masters. He learned Sanskrit in order
to study Indian sacred writings and
scientific texts. He was soon to be
regarded as the equal of his masters,
both for his learning and for his
desire to spread the knowledge he
possessed. His erstwhile teachers
thus became his pupils and he taught
them the elements of Islamic, Mani-
chean, Christian, Mazdaist and Hebrew
thought with such success that they
gave him the affectionate sobriquet
"Boundless Ocean".
Al-Biruni's profound study of the
Hindu religion enabled him to under¬
take a comparative study of the major
religions of his day, examining for the
first time the ties which bind the Greek,
Christian, Manichean, Jewish and Hindu
faiths. He particularly stressed the
Hindu belief in the transmigration of
souls.
His work on India is not, however,
concerned solely with religion, but also
contains chapters of the greatest value
on the Hindu social system and Indian
geography, mathematics and medicine.
It is greatly to his credit that, unlike
so many of his contemporaries, he saw
India as something more than merely
a place where rich booty was to be
had. His work is thus an objective
and complete record of Hindu civi¬
lization and a source-book for his
fellow-Muslims who had until then been
ignorant of Hindu culture.
Al-Biruni's work thus presents us
with an outstanding example of an
encyclopaedic mind ranging over both
the exact sciences and the human
sciences, and a model of respect for
other people's manners, beliefs and
customs in short, for other people's
cultures. He teaches us tolerance
through understanding of other nations,
and for this reason we respect al-Biruni
as he respected others. As he him¬
self said:
"If you are to learn to like other
peoples, learn their language and show
respect for their way of life for
their customs, their thought and their
religion."

Ancient splendours of Ghazna
Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) was one of Asia's
most splendid cities in the 10th century. It was the
capital and cradle of the Ghaznavid dynasty which ruled
from the frontiers of Mesopotamia to the Ganges river.
Al-Biruni, the great Muslim scientist and philosopher,
lived at Ghazna most of the time from 1017 until his
death about 1048 A.D. Here he wrote some of his most
famous works, including his encyclopaedic study on
India. The Mongol invasion of 1221 destroyed most of
Ghazna, sparing only two minarets and a palace, today
in ruins. This star-shaped tower of burnt brick, 43 metres
high and decorated with Arabic inscriptions, is the base
of one of the minarets; it was once topped by a cylindrical
upper tower (see also page 18).
