UNESCO COURIER-Page 2 DECEMBER 1951
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS
by H. E. Luis Padilla Nervo
Permanent Mexican Representative to the United Nations
H. E. Ambassador Luis Padilla Nert"o has made
a special sta ! eTMnt for this Human Rights issue
of the Courier, which we publish below. Ambas-
sador Padilla Nervo was elected President of tht
United Nations General Assembly in Paris on NOL'-
ember 6, 1951.
THE Universal Declaration of Human Rights.adopted by the General Asse bly of the
United Nations during its Third Session in
Paris in 1948, has brought a ray of hope to all
peoples. At a time in history when we all follow
with anxiety the international debates on whose
outcome the very issue of peace or war may
well depend, the Declaration exalts the best
traits and characteristics of the human person.
In this hospitable land of France, where.
brought forth by a revolution, the Rights of Man
were first proclaimed for all. the old and the
new Declarations of Rights stand side by side,
in Paris, the city where the Member States of
the United Nations unanimously agreed to pro-
claim their firm belief in man's dignity and in
the urgent need to guarantee the enjoyment of
those rights to all mankind.
The Declaration of the Rights of Man born of
the French Revolution inspired many peoples to
incorporate in their legislation those principles
whereby human beings have been protected in
many respects over the last century. The United
Nations also adopted several of those principles
of the French Declaration of Rights into their own
Universal Declaration.
Moved by a generous spirit of human under-
standing, the United Nations took into account
the suggestions made by the representatives of
their Member States and discussed at length the
minimum guarantees that were to be given the
human person as far as the enjoyment of rights
was concerned. The result of this painstaking
work was the Declaration of 1948, that stands
as one of the most constructive achievements of
the World Organization.
The Declaration is not a vague promise. Nor
is it a document deprived of effective force. It
is backed by a moral conviction which springs
from the general aspirations of all men ; it is
also proof of the will to live in peace, within a
spirit of social justice, that is common to all
peoples.
By affirming the rights of the individual and
appealing to governments and individuals alike
to respect the principles contained therein, the
Declaration emphasises the reality of the words
of Benito Jaurez, the great Mexican patriot, when
he said :"Peace is the respect in which one
holds other people's rights". By the effective
application of human rights peace will indeed
become stable and certain : history shows us
repeatedly that wars are the result of the abuse
of the weak by the strong, of the powerless by
the powerfuL
The right of a person to protection against any
violation of his individual guarantees is undoub-
tedly one of the most outstanding features of
the Declaration without such recourse against
any possible abuse of authority, the exercise of
human rights would have little or no foundations.
The principle of no discrimination, that makes
the Declaration really universal and applicable
in sovereign statee and non-seli-goveming tern-
tories alike, is also worthy of unreserved
backing. Discrimination not only degrades those
who are its victims, but dishonours those who
practice it. By guaranteeing privacy, freedom to
work, social security and education to all indi-
viduals, without distinction of race. sex, nation-
ality or political or religious belief (living them
at the same time access to a resource which pro-
tects them against any violation of individual
guarantees) the Paris Declaration fulfils the role
of guardian over the essential rights of men
everywhere.
The transcendent vitality of the Declaration has
already been proved by the incorporation of
some of its principles into the national legislation
of several countries which in these last years
have become politically autonomous. Such
examples are proof that the Declaration, though
not juridically bindinc : r for the Member States of
the United Nations, has already a moral
influence that, with time. can only strengthen the
respect of the human person as a foundation of
all socit. : orders. Good relations betwen gov-
ernments and peoples and the establishment
of a fair peace in which men can work to build
a free world, can also be strengthened only by
enforcing the principles of the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
PERIODS of international ten-
sion do not lend themselves
to the advancement of the
freedoms and rights of
mankind. On the one hand,
rearmament and the security
measures taken in the different
countries inevitably lead to a
restriction of liberty and act as a
drag on social and educational
progress. On the other hand, on
an internatlonal level, the repre-
sentatives of the various govern-
ments are less inclined to assume
new obligations for their countries
and to allow international organiz-
ations any greater.'right of in-
spection"in matters so far regard-
ed as purely national.
It is therefore hardly surprising
that in 1951, six years after the
signature of the United Nations
Charter and three years after the
adoption of the Universal Declar-
ation of'human Rights, the
labours devoted by the Commiss-
ion on Human Rights to the
Covenant and the methods of
implementing it have not yet led
to results that can be submitted
for the approval of the General
Assembly of the United Nations,
now in session in Paris.
The general public is justifiably
uneasy at this long delay. The
contrast between hopes and facts
- too often harsh-is all the more
keenly felt because, thanks to the
United Nations information servi-
ces and to the laudable efforts of
Unesco, the Non-Governmental
Organizations and a large number
of educationists, the public has
become familiar with the terms of
the Universal Declaration, and now
awaits the completion of the other
two panels of the triptych pro-
mised to the peoples of the world.
But what the public does not
know-and here it is our duty to
enlighten it-is the immediate, the
outstanding difficulties with which
those working on the Covenant
have met. In this connection,
there are, as I see it, four fund-
amental questions.
What form of covenant 1
1"he nrst relates to the content ofthe future Covenant. Would it
be better to have (as the British
and the Americans, supported by
India, suggest) a number of se-
parate pacts, ratified independently
of each other, each covering one
group of related freedoms and
rights (individual, civil and public
freedoms ; economic, social and
cultural rights ; family rights ;
political rights, etc.) ; or, as ass-
erted by the Slav countries and
certain European, Latin American
, by René Cassin,
Vice-Chairman of the U. N. Commission on Human Rights.
and Asiatic States, to adopt a
single Covenant, in conformity
with a Declaration inspired by the
unity of mankind, and thus, at one
stroke, convert most of the rights
and freedoms proclaimed in that
Declaration into binding legal
obligations ?
The 1950 Assembly, in giving its
instructions to the Commission on
Human Rights, opted for the
second of these ideas. And in the
spring of 1951 the Commission pre-
pared a draft in conformity with
this ruling, taking account of a
French suggestion that allowance
should be made for differences in
the wording of the pledges given
by the various States, which should
correspond to the differences in
character between options of free-
doms (calling for legislation in-
volving no very great expense) and
individual rights requiring State
aid (such as social reforms and
long-term plans backed by large-
scale resources).
Both groups-the advocates of
the multiple and those of the
single form of Covenant-intend
to raise the question again, for the
purpose of wresting from the 1951
Assembly a hard-and-fast ruling
in conformity with their views. We
ourselves hope that the General
Assembly will reject both of these
extreme solutions, for the adoption
of either would considerably delay
the date at which our work could
be brought to fruition.
Supervision of progress
The second difficulty is to decidewhich international organiza-
tions shall be entrusted with super-
vising the progress made by each
State in the field of human rights,
and with considering any com-
plaints that may be made against
one State or another on the ground
that it has violated the Covenant.
Here we are faced with two
ideas that are not easy to recon-
cile. The first is that the general
safeguarding of human rights is a
matter for the United Nations-
more particularly for their Com-
mission on Human Rights, which
was set up in accordance with the
Charter-and, in regard to certain, oaf these rights, for the Specialized
Agencies, like the International
Labour Organization, Unesco,
WHO, etc. But according to the
second idea-that of equality and
reciprocity between States-those
signing and ratifying the Covenant
would be authorized to reject all
interference or supervision at the
hands of countries that refused to
accept the obligations of the
Covenant as binding upon them-
selves. Care must be taken not to
alienate the most co-operative
among the States by giving them
reason to fear that they may be-
come the guinea-pigs of a world-
wide experiment, the continual
butts of the rest.
Here again a constructive basis
is offered by the draft Covenant.
It vests the right of general and
periodical supervision of the pro-
gress achieved in the signatory
States, and even in those bound
only by the Charter, in the Com-
mission on Human Rights, whose
authority would be linked and co-
ordinated, if need be, with that of
ILO, Unesco, etc. The right to
deal with complaints made against
a signatory State would be vested
in a new body, made up of inde-
pendent persons of distinction,
who would be selected by the
International Court of Justice
from nominees proposed only by
the signatory States.
Much, it is true, still remains to
be done. The question arises, for
instance, whether this future Com-
mittee is to be maintained at the
expense of the United Nations as a
whole, or only of the signatories to
the Covenant. But the right path
seems to have been found ; as the
adherents to the Covenant in-
crease in number, the difficulties
will progressively diminish.
Appeals against violations
T* he third crucial difficulty con-sists in deciding who is to be
entitled to appeal to the new
Human Rights Committee in the
event of any violation of human
rights in a given country. Should
the appeal be made only by
another signatory State, as desired
by those governments which dis-
like innovations ? Or should the
right of petition be extended also
to individuals (even against their
own government) and to non-
governmental organizations, such
as those which have already been
granted consultative status (A. or
B.) by the United Nations ? The
importance of the point at issue
can be easily perceived : either out-
dated procedures must be main-
tained, or else there must be a
juridical revolution, enabling a
private individual to appeal to an
international body against any
administrative measure, verdict or
law of his own country which, in
his view, violates the Covenant on
Human Rights.
A certain number of States have
already signified their willingness
to sign a separate Protocol, grant-
ing the right of petition against
themselves on a basis of recipro-
city, and in accordance with a form
of procedure that differs apprec-
iably from the European Pact on
Human Rights. But Uruguay has
put forward another idea, which
it suggests should be incorporated
in the Covenant itself-that the
right of appeal to the Human
Rights Committee, independently
of any particular State, should be
granted to a United Nations At-
torney-General, representing the
international community. Some
people consider that a transitional
measure such as this would enable
progress to be made, and provide
an escape from the dilemma,
without crossing the Rubicon at
one stride !
Sacrifice of sovereignty
T* he fourth question consists indeciding how the Covenant is
to be applied within a Federal
State or Union of States which in-
cludes federated States, provinces
and colonies enjoying a certain
mesasure of legislative autonomy.

UNESCO JOINS IN UNITED NATIONS'
EFFORTS TO MAKE HUMAN RIGHT.
DECLARATION A LIVING REALITY
by M. Jaime Torres Bodet
Director-General of Unesco
mental education campaign, of which it regards the universal
extension of primary education as an indispensable prolong-
ation. and it has provided for the support of this campaign a
whole series of economic, civic, and trade union measures.
Thus the battle against ignorance is to be waged on all front.
with ever-increasing forces.
In the field of science and culture, Unesco's many activities
are directed towards the double aim of increasing the world's
inheritance of creations of the mind and sharing it out between
all human beings. Research becomes a service to humanity
when we so facilitate and guide if that it is brought to bear
upon problems of world interest, like the development of the the
Arid Zone, or the tensions created by the rapid introduction
of modern technical processes into countries of ancient culture.
It is important to safeguard the eeqom and rights of
creative artists, and we hope that our patient work in this
direction will soon be croWned by potion of a Universal
Copyright Convention. But We should be failing in our duty
if we did not try to open the horizon of a liberating culture to
the ever increasing multitudes. To spread among the public
at large a knowledge of the scientific discoveries that are
changing the face of the world, to equip libraries and
museums so that they shall become centres of intellectual and
artistic initiation, to disseminate reproductions of masterpieces
pi painting throughout the world, to help musicians and spread
a knowledge of their work - such tasks as these, upon which
we are now engaged, illustrate what is the keynote of our
programme.
THIS is the place to mention planning of the futureCovenant of Human Rights. It would be of outstanding
significance if this legal instrument were to cover, not
only civic and political freedom. but the rights to education
and a share in cultural liie and the benefits of scientific
advancement. States ratifying the Covenant would be under-
taking clear obligations, and the difficult process oi applying
these rights, which Unesco has already begun but with
inadequate resources, would thereby be immensely facilitate.
It is our hope that the provisions dealing with these rights,
which in accordance with our suggestions were accepted by
the Human Rights Commission at its recent meeting, will figure
in the draft Covenant when this appears upon the final agenda
of the United Nations General Assembly.
The implementation of Human Rights is inseparable from
access to information, which has become so essential in modem
life in connexion with the spreading of knowledge and with
effective freedom of expression. But information can only be
spread freely and universally if all sections of humanity have
the necessary material resources at their command. This
emphasizes the whole gravity of the newsprint shortage
which is today hampering the production of newspapers and
books, and imparts urgency to the appeal launched by Unesco
for immediate international action to increase the production
of newsprint and distribute what exists more equitably between
the various countries.
This is a threat of reaction which must be dispelled before
it is possible to envisage fresh progress. In a distracted
world which is apt to let its energies be diverted from work in
the service of peace and humanity. circumstances all too often
compel us, in many field. to mark time. But our faith is not
shaken. History will, in the end, vindicate men of goodwill,
provided they persevere in their efforts and never lose that
thirst for justice and magnanimity, which is another way of
saying that they never lose their power to believe, dare and
achieve.
THE extension of free and compulsory primary educationto all children of the world still encounters too many
obstacles arising from the unequal distribution of wealth
between the peoples. Here, too, international co-operation
must intervene decisively. The XIVth Conference on Public
Education, which met this year at Geneva under the joint
consonant with the immense needs it has to meet. The estab
has invited governments to draw up national plans for a
steady increase in school attendance, and it goes without
saying that such plans will receive our full support.
For its part, the Inter-American Cultural Council has already
decided, at its inaugural meeting recently held in Mexico, in
which Unesco took part to undertake a literacy and funda-
THREE years ago. on 10 December 1948. the General
assembly of the United Nations adopted the first
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the history
of the world. The anniversary of this historic event will cer-
tainly be celebrated with even more mark than in previous
years. Not only on this day. however. but on an days.
Unesco's campaign makes itself felt through books, the press.
the radio, the film, exhibitions, and teaching in schools, for the
purpose of disseminating the Declaration as widely as possible
and making its scope and meaning knOwn throughout the
world. This year, one of the major themes has been the
denunciation of racial prejudice, based on a thorough and
critical study of the facts.
By seeking thus to mobilize the opinion of the world, Unesco
shows that it is faithfully carrying out its obligations. With
all its resources, and an increased effectiveness due to the
dynamic concentration of its activities, our Organization is
joining in the work of the United Nations to establish Human
Rights in men's minds. as in their everyday lives.
The objectives aimed at by the Declaration are at the very
centre of the mission which our Constitution has assigned to
us. The world which we are trying to build through educa-
tion, science and culture perceives its features in this bold
outline of a community of free men. men enabled to perform
in full their services to humanity. But I would like to
rapid survey of the rights with which Unesco is more esp -
cially concerned and. in so doing, to underline the increasingly
universal nature of our work. In making it universal we are,
surely, practising enlightened realism, for it is by giving all
human beings a worthier and fairer share in life that we shall
bring about that true peace lor which the world yearns -
peace based on solidarity between the peoples.
In that vast column of humanity which is on the march in
search of knowledge, can we reconcile ourselves to seeing the
advance guard taking giant strides while half the world lags
behind in a cloud of ignorance and is thus condemned to a
miserable existence ? This initial inequality, with all the
dangers it implies, points to our most urgent duty, which is to
give these masses of the people minimum of technical and
civic knowledge wherewith to secure their emancipation.
This as I have said more than once, is the purpose of the
international enterprise in fundamental education which
Unesco has launched this year, on largest scale that its
limited resources permit, bearing in mind that it may later
receive help which will enable it to make the project more
consonant with the immense needs it has to meet. The estab-
lishment of a centre for Latin America has opened the way
to the creation, without further delay, of a world network of
schools where, within the space of a few years, training will
be imparted to thousands of teachers who will then be called
upon, in their turn, to train future leaders in their own countries.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 04
NOT AN AGE OF ATOMS BUT OF WELFARE
FOR ALL
by
Arnold J. Toynbee
Today we consider with pride the
progress made by Man in his march
from prehistoric times to the present
age, and teach our children to respect
the achievements of science and
technology which have gradually
transformed the traditional ways of
human life. This is how we regard
the past, but how 300 years hence
will our own age be judged ? What
will our descendants consider the
outstanding development of this cen-
tury ?
Arnold Toynbee, the noted British
historian, has made some significant
predictions on these questions in
an article he wrote recently, and from
which we reprint extracts by permis-
sion of the New York Times Maga-
zine, in which the article appeared.
IN the contemporary world-inwhatever age or century one
happens to be living-religious
and political differences between
various sections of the living
generation are apt to seem absolute
and ultimate. For instance, our
seventeenth century ancestors in
Western Christendom could not
conceive of any greater gulf than
that which seemed in their day to
be fixed between the Catholic and
Protestant varieties of Western
Christianity. By contrast, we their
descendants, looking back on them
and their conflicts III the perspec-
tive of three centuries of history,
are far more conscious of the gulf
between our own age and the world
of the seventeenth century than we
are of the domestic divisions
within that seventeenth century
world. To our eyes, those Pro-
testants and Catholics are all alike,
seventeenth-century-minded people
first and foremost ; and it needs
some effort of discrimination on
our part to appreciate the nice
distinction between the warring
religious camps.
In the light of this historical
precedent-and there are countless
others that would have served
equally well to illustrate our point- We may be sure that, 300 years
from today, our own descendants
will be much more alive to the
common features of the twentieth
century world-and especially
those common features that seem
to them distinctive-than they
will he to the current differences
DECEMBER 1951
''Today we have tapped a wholly new kind of material resource in discovering how to harness mechanical power to
technology, thus bringing the benefits of civilization within the horizon of every man's hopes". No longer, for example,
need farmers fear the ravages of insect pests on their harvests when aircraft can be called on to protectively spray
vast areas.
that mean so much at the moment
to all members of the living genera-
tion, in whatever continent or camp
we may happen to have been born.
Can we guess what the out-
standing feature of our twentieth
century will appear to be ir. the
perspective of 300 years ? No doubt
we shall not all guess alike. Some
of us will guess that the present
age will be looked back upon as the
age of scientific discovery. Others
will expect to see it branded as the
age in which Fascist and Commun-
ist apostates from a Christian
will-so I should guess-come
to look both less important and
less interesting than will be easily
credible to anyone alive today. In
the easy wisdom that comes after
the event, our successors will,
perhaps, be able to pronounce that
this or that policy for achieving a
common twentieth century ideal
was more suitable than the rival
policy was to the social conditions
of this or that region in that
antique and still unstandardized
twentieth century world.
They may even judge one
ARTICLE 25. Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate
for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,
clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and
the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,
widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyondhis controt.
civilization harnessed science to
the service of a neo-barbarism. My
own guess is that our age will be
remembered chiefly neither for its
horrifying crimes nor for its
astonishing inventions, but for its
having been the first age since the
dawn of civilization, some five or
six thousand years back, in which
people dared to think it practicable
to make the benefits of civilization
available for the whole human race.
By comparison with the signifi-
cance of this common twentieth
century new ideal, the differences
between the conflicting ideologies
''The new ideal and objective of extending the benefits of civilization to the
common man will in future times tower above other features of our century."
One practical application of this ideal is the Expanded Technical Assistance
Programme of the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies under which
experts are advising the peoples of under-developed countries how to make
the best use of their natural resources.
twentieth century ideology was
better or worse than another in
some absolute moral sense. But
the common features of our
century will, I fancy, be the
features standing out the most
prominently in perspective ; and,
among these, the new ideal and
objective of extending the benefits
of civilization to the common man
will in future centuries tower
above the rest.
Perhaps there are two points
here that are worth underlining :
This vision of a good life for all IS
a new one, and-whatever our
success or our failure may be in
the attempt to translate this vision
into reality-this new social
objective has probably come to
stay. That the ideal of welfare for
all is new is surely true ; for, as
far as I can see, it is no older than
the seventeenth century West
European settlements on the east
coast of North America that have
grown into the United States. And
it has surely come to stay with us
as long, at any rate, as our new
invention of applying mechanical
power to technology ; for this
sudden vast enhancement of man's
ahilitv to make non-human nature
produce what man requires from
her has, for the first time in
history, made the ideal of welfare
for all a practical objective instead
of a mere utopian dream.
So long as this aim continues to
he practical politics, mankind is
certain, however many times we
may fail, to go on making one
attempt after another to reach the
oal. When once the odious in-
equality that has hitherto been a
distinguishing mark of civilization
has ceased to be taken for granted
as something inevitable, it becomes
inhuman to go on putting up with
it-and still more inhuman to
try to perpetuate this inequality
deliberately.
If the new material resources
required in order to make practical
politics of the new ideal of welfare
for all had been confined forever
to new agricultural resources, the
dream would soon have faded away
again. After the conquest of North
America by the plough, the only
remaining'virgin soil in the
Temperate Zone was Manchuria ;
and after the plough's conquest of
Manchuria in the early twentieth
century, the future of mankind, as
a whole, so far from being anything
like.'welfare for all", would have
been something like the present as
it can be seen in China or India.
The reason why.''\velfare for all"
is still practical politics in the
world at large today is because we
have tapped a wholly new kind of
material resource in discovering
how to harness mechanical power
to technology. Mankind's hope of
better things lies in a permanent
industrial revolution.
The outlook of the twentieth
century world at large is governed,
as I see it, by two facts. The first
fact is that three-quarters of
mankind are to-day still living the
traditional life of an agricultural
civilization in which there is no
reserve of virgin soil and therefore
no possibility of providing more
than a tiny minority of the popula-
tion with anything better than bare
subsistence out of agricultural
production.
But, in this wold-fashioned starve-
ling agrarian world, the Industrial
Revolution has brought with it a
hope for all mankind, from the
prosperous American technician
and farmer to the most miserable
Chinese or Indian coolie, of break-
ing right through the iron limits to
which the extension of the benefits
of civilization has normally been
subject in an agricultural society.
This hope is now rapidly dawning
in the hearts of the depressed and
ignorant peasantry that to-day still
constitutes three-quarters of the
living generation of mankind. They
have begun to ask themselves how
they are to attain those benefits of
civilization which a mechanized
technology has at last brought
within the horizon of every man's
hones.
How is this depressed three-
quarters of mankind going to set
about the stupendously difficult
task of gaining the benefits of
civilization ? Now that the hun-
dreds of millions of peasants are
aware of the relative well-being of
the Western peoples, nothing : is
goin to stop them from setting out
to reach a goal which the West
seems to them to have attained
already. And no doubt only trial
and error are goin to make them
aware of the difficulties in their
path which are glaringly manifest
to Western eyes..
For us westerners it is easy to
see that the mass of mankind to-day
does not command those assets and
advantages which have enabled a
Western minority within the last
two centuries to make some
progress toward a wider distribu-
tion of the benefits of civilization
inside the narrow circle of our
Western society.
.., The sunreme need of the hour
is, I would suggest, an immense
patience and mutual toleration.
A revolutionary improvement in
means of communication has
suddenly brought peoples with
sharplv diverse traditions or civi-
lizations into close physical contact
with one another. If, in spite of our
diversity, we find ourselves all
alike, pursuing what is ultimately
a common ideal, this IS something
to be thankful for.

"CULTURE MUST
BE ONE OF THE
FOUNDATIONS
FOR WORLD
UNDERSTANDING"
by
PROFESSOR
ALBERT EINSTEIN
IN order to grasp the fullsignificance of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,
it is well to be fully aware of the
world situation that gave birth to the
United Nations and to Unesco.
The devastation wrought by the wars
of the last half century had brought
home the fact to everybody that,
with the present-day level of technical
achievement, the security of nations
could be based only on supra-
national institutions and rules of
conduct. It understood that, in the
long run, an all-destroying conflict
can be avoided only by the setting
up of a world federation of nations.
So-as a modest beginning of
international order-the United
Nations was founded. This organiz-
ation, however, is but a meeting
ground for delegates of national
governments and not for the peoples'
representatives acting independently
on the basis of their own personal
convictions. Furthermore, U. N.
decisions do not have binding force
on any national government ; nor
do any concrete means exist by
which the decisions can be enforced.
The effectiveness of the United
Nations is still further reduced by
the fact that membership has been
refused to certain nations, whose
exclusion seriously affects the supra-
character of the organization. Yet,
in itself, the fact that international
problems are brought up and dis-
cussed in the broad light of day fa-
vours the peaceful solution of con-
flicts. The existence of a supra-
national platform of discussion is apt
to accustom the peoples gradually
to the idea that national interests
must be safeguarded by negotiation
and not by brute force.
This psychological or educa-
tional effect I regard as the United
Nations'most valuable feature. A
world federation presupposes a new
kind of loyalty on the part of man,
a sense of responsibility that does
not stop short at the national bound-
aries. To be truly effective, such
loyalty must embrace more than
purely political issues. Understand-
ing among different cultural groups,
mutual economic and cultural aid
are the necessary additions.
Only by such endeavour will the

ism and power politics. No effective
institution for the collective security
of nations is possible without
understanding and a measure of
reciprocal confidence.
To the U. N. was added Unesco,
the agency whose function it is to
pursue these cultural tasks. It has
in a greater measure than U. N.
been able to avoid the paralyzing
influence of power politics.
Realizing that healthy international
relations can be created only among
populations made up of individuals
who themselves are healthy and
enjoy a measure of independence,
the United Nations elaborated a
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, which was adopted by the
U. N. General Assembly on 10
December, 1948.
The Declaration establishes a
number of universally comprehen-
sible standards that are designed to
protect the individual, to prevent
his being exploited economically,
and to safeguard his development
and the free pursuit of his activities
within the social framework.
To spread these standards among
all U. N. Member States is rightly
regarded and aimed at as an impor-
tant objective. Unesco has accord-
ingly instituted this third celebration
for the purpose of drawing attention
far and wide to these fundamental
aspirations as a basis on which to
restore the political health of the
peoples.
It was scarcely to be avoided that
the Declaration should take the
form of a legalistic document, which
in its rigidity may lead to endless
discussion. It is impossible for such
a text to take the great diversity of
conditions of life in the different
countries fully into account ; in ad-
dition, it is unavoidable that such a
text admits various interpretations of
detail. The general tendency of the
Declaration, however, is unmistak-
able and provides a suitable,
generally acceptable basis for judg-
mend and action.
To give formal recognition to
standards and to adopt them as the
guiding lines of action in the teeth
of all the adversities of a changing
situation are two very different
things-as the impartial observer may
see particularly in the history of
religious institutions. Then and only
then will the Declaration exert
effective influence, when the United
Nations itself shows by its decisions
and actions that it does embody, de
facto, the spirit of this, its own
Declaration.

EDUCATION AND HUMAN RIGHTS
IT is only a little while, againstthe scale of recorded history,
since any who claimed the
right to education for everybody
would have been thought mad.
He would probably have been
thought dangerous also. Yet on
December 10th, three years ago,
the Governments of the Member
States of the United Nations
solemnly declared that every one
did have the right to education.
This solemn assurance did not,
it is true, have the force of law,
for it was not made in a Treaty
or Covenant. But this Article 26
of the Universal Declaration does
set a standard, so that if any one
anywhere in the world claims that
his right to education is not being
given in practice he knows that
he is asking for something that
the governments of the world have
said should be his.
There are many who could make
such a protest at the present time.
More than half of the adult men
and women in the world cannot
even read or write. We do not
know exactly how many of the
children of the world between the
ages of six and twelve are not in
regular attendance at school, but
it can hardly be a much smaller
proportion.
We know that access to educ-
ation is not always given without
discrimination of"race, colour, sex,
language, religion, political or
other opinion, national or social
origin, property, birth or other
status", as the Declaration says it
should be.
Prejudice and poverty
THIS is not due only to preju-1 dice, though there is a great
deal of prejudice in the world still.
It is due also to the difficulties in
which nations find themselves,
though they accept the principle,
in turning it into practice, that is
b say in building the new schools
requ m ending and p"ying tho
teachers to man them, and in
raising their general standard of
life so that they can support such
financial burdens. For very many
countries there is little chance of
doing these things without inter-
national aid.
That is where Unesco comes in,
both through its own activities
and through its partnership in the
United Nations programme of
Technical Assistance to raise the
economic level of life in under-
developed countries.
by üonel Elvin
(Director. Department of Education, Unesco)
Unesco plays its part in three
ways. It is concerned, in an advi-
sory capacity, with the attempt
now being made to supplement the
Declaration by a Covenant. It is
concerned with international edu-
cational assistance to those coun-
tries that request it for turning
this principle into fact. And it is
concerned with getting the idea of
Human Rights understood in the
schools so that our boys and girls
will be fitted to become responsible
citizens of the world of to-morrow.
The Commission on Human
Rights, at its Seventh Session in
April and May of this year,
discussed the right to education, in
common with other rights, when it
was drawing up a draft Covenant
to submit to the Economic and
Social Council. Unesco, through
the Director-General and members
of the Secretariat, took part in
If this were done the advance in
the life of the peoples of the world
would be incalculable.
Now the Economic and Social
Council, when it received this draft
Covenant from the Commission,
raised the question whether social
rights of this kind ought to be in
one Covenant with political and
civic rights ; and it has referred
that question to the General
Assembly which is now meeting in
Paris. The Executive Board of
Unesco believes there should be a
single Covenant so as to link eco-
nomic, social and cultural rights
with civil and political liberties,
and it has asked the Director-
General to emphasise this at the
General Assembly. It has also in-
vited him to continue discussions
with the Member States of Unesco
to ascertain their views as to the
substance of the draft clauses on
ARTICLE 26 : 1. Everyone has the right to education. Education
shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Ele-
mentary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional
education shall be made generally available and higher education shall
be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.
2. Education shall be directed to the full development of the human
personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and
friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further
the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.
3. Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that
shall be given to their children. <.
these meetings. Two Articles in
the draft Covenant dealt with
education.
The first of these has several
clauses. It re-asserts the right
of everybody to education, says
that primary education shall
compulsory and avi1a. l>le free
to all, tH./ihat secondary education
shall be generally available and
made progressively free, and that
fundamental education (for those
who have not received proper
primary education) shall be encou-
raged : and there are other impor-
tant clauses.
The second of these articles is
particularly interesting, for it binds
every Member State that signs the
Covenant, and that does not yet
have free and compulsory primary
education, to draw up (within two
years) a plan for achieving It
within a reasonable period of time.
education rights.
Many countries are in fact
pressing on with schooling, and
Unesco has been putting into effect
its first measures for assisting
them
An international conference on
the subject was held last summer
in Geneva, under the joint auspi-
ces of Unesco and the Interna-
tional Bureau of Education ; and
this will be followed by regional
conferences to work things out in
more local detail (the first being
for the countries of southern Asia
and the South Pacinc, in 1952).
For this purpose studies will be
made (six have already been) on
the problem as it affects particular
countries, until a study has been
made for every country in the
world. Expert advisers will be sent
by Unesco on the request of Mem-
ber States, to help them by bring-
ing international experience to
their aid.
The third way in which Unesco
links education and Human Rights
is broader : it concerns the under-
standing in our schools and uni-
versities of the concept of Human
Rights as a whole.
"human Rights"is of course not
a subject that can be taught, like
history or geography or mathema-
tics ; though much teaching, espe-
cially in history, will involve study
of them and of the struggle to win
them. In the same way the
consciousness of what their own
country stands for is in part taught
to boys and girls and young people
through their school subjects.
Lesson in living
BUT it goes further than that :it is conveyed through school
activities and school ceremonies
and through the way the school
conducts itself and feels itself
as part of the community. In the
same way an international society
in which human rights are really
respected can be felt through the
schools as a growing reality, over
and above what is formally taught
in class.
To think out how to do these
things is not easy. Unesco is
calling a seminar of teachers in the
summer of 1952 to discuss the best
methods in the school. In con-
nexion with this it is preparing a
handbook of hints for teachers,
and a book of basic documents,
with scholarly commentaries,
illustrating the struggle for human
rights in the past and the present.
It is asking Member States, this
year and every year, to observe
Human Rights Day in their schools.
These things can all help to make
a better world, for the schoolchil-
dren of today when they are grown
men and women.
But to do this, they must be
taken up with vigour and with
imagination everywhere. How
many of our schools are satisfied
that they do now treat their own
children without discrimination of
sex, or colour, or politics or religion,
or give a view of other people that
recognises their equal rights too ?
If every teacher, schoolboy or
schoolgirl who reads this article
could think of one thing in his own
school where this was not yet done,
and would set out to make practice
there accord with the principles of
the Declaration before December
10th, 1952, this would be a truly
significant year in the history of
human rights.
Although many nations accept the principle of free access to education for
all, they lack the means to provide schools and train teaching staffs for
them. Where teachers are available, however, improvised classrooms can
be organized, like the'one shown above, held in an Indonesian village.

DECEMBER 1951 Page 7-UNESCO COURIER
Millions of
women have
still to win
equality
By Georges FRADIER
discussed much less than it was fifty years ago, and because it is rarely
mentioned there is a tendency to consider the problem as solved-or
nearly so. Facts demonstrate the contrary, for while in many countries
women have the right to go to law and,
Women are still deprived of these rights.
It is not possible,  even in  1951, to speak in general of "the rights of
women in the modern world", and in any case, even the phrase "the
modem world " is illusory, used in this connexion. The English woman
or the Swede, for example, may with good reason point to the successful
evolution of her legal status, but she should not forget that millions of
other women are still no letter off in this respect than their female
ancestors of the Middle Ages, or even of the Stone Age, for that matter.
A clear distinction must be drawn between the two main problems
which concern the status of women. Firstly, in many countries women
have still to gain their political rights and, even in those countries which
have officially recognized and proclaimed them, their full application
still meets with many obstacles, In this connexion, therefore, the fight
which has long been waged must be continued with even greater effort.
Secondly, inequality expressed through attitudes and customs is most
deeply entrenched in human minds, and it is here that it must be rooted
out and destroyed. The leading place which women have filled in the
field of education gives them an effective weapon for this fight.
"""
Today, too, women have a means of bringing about international
action through the work of the Commission on the Status of Women in
the United Nations Economic and Social Council which can co-ordinate
the individual efforts of women in all countries.
This need for personal action was stressed recently by a member of
the Commission, who said :"It is up to all women to make equamity &alpha; a
reality."
ANY discussion on the subject of women's rights atmost invariablyresults in comparisons being drawn between the most favourable
of present day conditions and those of between fifty and one
hundred years ago. The resuits of such contrasts are usually
encouraging, for there is no doubt that in many countries women have
fought for and achieved their emancipation. Legislation in their favour
has been responsible for widespread changes and the idea, of equality
between the sexes meets with almost unanimous agreement. Yet how
justified is this satisfaction with the apparent progress that has been
made ?
To judge the real measure of what has been achieved one might do
better to compare even the most satisfactory of present-day conditions
with the text of a document that expresses on this subject the widest
and noblest aspirations of our time : The Universel Declaration of Human of Human
Rights. In this  Declaration, the United Nations laid down a common
standard of achievement to be aimed for by all peoples and all nations
at this midpoint in the 20th century. Its texts are not Utopian in concept.
They provide a precise definition of the legislation which should govern
all peoples in the light of present knowledge, technical progress and
economic conditions, taking into account social and juridical progress
already achieved.
Perhaps the spirit of their universality of purpose and application is
best framed in the solemn words of the Preamble which declares"the
peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith...
in the equal rights of men and women".
Yet, in all honesty, one must admit that this "faith" in equal rights
too often remains a theoretical one that the rights named in the
Declaration are only partially applied, and that the status of women
remains far below the level defined by international legislators.
Nowadays, the social and political emancipation of women is

All over the world women are taking an increasingly active part in fundamental educa-
tion campaigns. Here, an entire Indian village turns out to greet the women members
of a mobile educational mission. In India, where once few women enjoyed political
rights, the present Constitution gives all women the right to vote and hold public office.
THROUGHOUT the ages those women
who led the fight for the emancip-
ation of their sex understood
clearly that the first right to be won
was the right to knowledge.
One of these was Christine de Pisan,
daughter of the physician-astrologer to
Charles V of France.
This woman, a widow at 25, defying ridi-
cule and scandal, accomplished in 1390.
the extraordinary feat of living on her
own by her pen."Ladies'Treasure"and
"A City for Ladies"were the first works
showing that Woman was really the equal
of Man. She wrote :"If it were the cus-
tom to send girls to school and teach
them as boys are taught, women would
understand the subtleties of art and
science, as well as men do. Jþ
Her successors-the Englishwoman,
Mary Astell, in the 17th century and the
followers of the French thinkers in the
18th-revolted in like manner against the
unjust prejudice which made them out to
be infcrio : r to men.
There was another conntry where
women gave no thought to the question
of"rights", absorbed as they were in
carrying out what they regarded as their
duty. That country was America. The
wife of the New England settler was ac-
customed to stand by her husband's side
and fire a musket when it came to de-
fending their farm and their children
against bands of marauders. She helped
to clear the land, to build, to organize.
Right through the War of Independence
she remained the tireless helpmate, feed-
ing, tending and supporting.
When, with the Declaration of Indepen-
dence proclaiming that"all men are
created equal", the Federal Constitution
was drawn up in 1787, the American
women, not unnaturally, might have ex-
pected to be given the vote. But, instead,
their menfolk refused to give constitu-
tional recognition to their rights as
"citizens".
After the first French Revolution,
Olympe de Gouges laid before the Con-
vention her"Declaration of the Rights of
Woman". This urged that women, who
"must take part in the making of laws',
should be granted the same"public pri-
vileges, appointments and offices as those
open to citizens"."Women", she argued,
"have the right to mount the scaffold ;
they should also have the right to mount
the rostrum". When, on 3 November 1793,
Olympe de Gouges bravely ascended the
steps of the guillotine, neither she, nor
any other woman, had yet climbed those
of the tribune.
Nevertheless, other women, in other
countries, continued to hope for emancipa-
tion, thanks to the great liberating
movement started in France.
In England, Mary Wollstonecraft pub-
lished in 1792 her"Vindication of the

"Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance", states
Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. During the last hundred
years, social legislation has helped to improve the living conditions of the less favour-
ed classes, but much more will have to be done if mothers and their children are
to be spared such conditions as those shown above.
Rights of Woman". Women, she said,
must be rescued from the depths of ignor-
ance to which they have been consigned ;
they must be educated. In this way, the
mind of Woman having reached an equal-
ity with the mind of Man, she will be
able to become his equal in married, pro-
fessional and political life.
The"Vindication of the Rights of
Woman"produced an outcry in England.
Women were frightened by the audacity
of this dangerous"hyena in petticoats",
so immoral and shameless as to advocate
co-education !
In America women gradually obtained
equality of civil rights.
Frenchwomen, on the other hand, had
been placed under tutelage by the Napo-
leonic Civil Code. They were now to wit-
ness the Revolution of 1848. Their hopes
stimulated again by this new revolution,
they formed associations, opened clubs,
started newspapers, organized lectures in
order to obtain educational equality, revi-
sion of the Civil Code, protection of
working women, and civic rights. Public
opinion was either scornful or indignant.
In 1849, the French were called upon to
elect a National Assembly. Jeanne De-
roin, in defiance of the Constitution, put
forward her name, and sought the backing
of the Social Democrats, saying :"You
stand. for the abolition of the exploitation
of men and women by men ; for the com-
plete and radical abolition of all privi-
leges of sex, race, birth, rank and for-
tune". And for the first time, a political
party admitted a woman among its can-
didates.
In England, in the middle of the XIXth
century, the boldest fighters were among
women in easy circumstances, and their
best propagandist was a man : John
stuart Mill, author of"Women's Ser-
vitude".
In 1867, when a bill for Electoral Re-
form was under discussion, J. S. Mill de-
manded that women should participate in
the right to vote. He submitted to Par-
liament a petition with 1499 signatures
attached (he had asked for 100), obtain-
ed by Mrs. Fawcett, who had recently'
founded in London the Society for
Women's Suffrage.
Mill's proposal was rejected, but the
drafters of the Reform bill, forgetting the
term"male persons", returned to the use
of the word"men". In that case, cried 
the women,"men"being a general term,'
the bill applies to us ! Eight thousand of
them demanded to have their names plac-
ed upon the electoral registers. Some suc-
ceeded in their demand ; but Parliament
had no intention of accepting such an
interpretation.
The Faculty of Medicine tenaciously re-
sisted all assaults. Elizabeth Garrett,
fired with enthusiasm by the lectures of
her compatriot, Elizabeth Blackwell, who,
having gained her degree in America, was
now the first woman doctor, had decided
in 1862 to become a doctor also. Debarred
from following the regular medical course,
she entered Saint Bartholomew's Hospital
as a nurse ; spent her nights studying, and,
followed the doctors on their rounds. In
1865, her brilIiant work earned for her the
first English medical degree conferred
upon a woman.
Having obtained municipal suffrage for
unmarried women, the National Union for
Women's Suffrage went on with its cam-
paign for the parliamentary vote. But'
Parliament, in spite of petitions and pro-
jects, turned a deaf ear. In 1897, cham-
pions of the female vote became more
numerous in Parliament and seemed on
the point of obtaining this right. Anti-
feminist speakers, however, engaged in an
interminable discussion of two bills ; one
for the combatting of parasites, the other
for the building of sewers. It was then
time for the House to rise. Thus,"for a
flea and a sewer", Englishwomen failed to
get the vote.

her appearance,"What part should

Liberal newspaper. Louise Otto, then 25,
replied :"Their participation is not a'

a mission to perform ; to wield the sword
of Justice and Truth in the halls of the

condition of working women, she also

first"General Association of German
Women"in 1865, and Augusta Schmidt
and H. Lange, who formed them in 1890
into the"General Association of Gover-
nesses", they were to fight to obtain the
same education, the same degrees and the
same posts as men. As for the right to
vote, they won it in 1919, under the Wei-
mar Constitution.
In Sweden the leader was Frederika
Bremer, who came across the Feminist
Movement while on a visit to America.
Returning to Sweden, she published
"Herta"in 1856, This novel was to be
the starting point of the whole Feminist
Movement in Sweden.
Frederika Bremer got 25 recognized as
the age at which women attained their
majority. Her discipleost of whom
were married women of the leisured class
- rapidly obtained equality in education.
From 1870 onwards, all the universities
were thrown open to women, who flocked
to them enthusiastically.
With obstinate determination the Swe-
dish women's"League for the right to
vote"campaigned until it met with suc-
cess in 1903.
The Norwegian woman was able to take
advantage of the ideas of equality current
in her democratic country. From the be-
ginning of the XIXth century, she began
to obtain equality in regard to education,
conditions of work and civil rights.
Women no longer had anything to agi-
tate for save political rights, when, in
1885, Gina Krog founded, in Christiania
(today, Oslo), the first association for
women's suffrage. In 1899, 12, 000 women
signed a petition demanding the vote.
Every member of the Storthing found a
copy of it on his desk and they gave the
matter their careful attention. First suc-
cess was registered in 1901, in the muni-
cipal field, when Norwegian women secur-
ed the election of 90 of their sex. In
1907 the doors of Parliament were opened
to them.
In Finland, under Russian domination,
the hour of national awakening had
struck, and the poet Z. Topelius wrote :
"Without women's help it will be impos-
sible to inspire our future generations
with noble ideas".
But the women of Finland were pro-
foundly ignorant, and the whole system
of education needed revising. Sarah
Wacklin, the Finnish woman writer,
founded girls'boarding-schools in Helsin-
ki and elsewhere. Frederika Runeberg
voiced Feminist demands : improvement
in education, in the position of married
women, in conditions of work. F. Bre-
mer's book, by rousing public opinion and
the Press, brought about the first public
debate on Feminism.
At the end of the century the women
took their stand by the men to organize
resistance and, in 1905, they stood by
them to compel Russia to re-open the
Diet, in which they were to take their
seats in 1907,
Bursting like a bombshell in the midst
of peaceful Danish families, the'Letters
of Clara Raphael"written by a girl of
19, split Denmark into two hostile camps.
Although published in 1849, her"Letters"
do not appear to bear the marks of any
foreign influence. Time passed ; the con-
flagration died down, and nothing more
happened until around 1870, Then, sud-
denly, under the instigation of Frederick
Bajer, the Feminist Movement came into
being, organized itself with astonishing
rapidity and straightway demanded the
right to vote. Its adherents immediately
undertook the social and political educa-
tion of women of the working class. In
less than 40 years, Danish women had
obtained the vote (1908) and the right to
stand (1909) in municipal elections. Six
years later, they became eligible for all
political assemblies.
Dutchwomen allowed the middle of the
XIXth century to pass without demons-
tration of any kind. In 1880, a Liberal
minister opened to them the University of
Groningen and, as a natural consequence,
all the other universities. They could

enter any of the professions. But they
still came under the famous Napoleonic
Code, their first Feminists pressed for
civil rights. Aletta Jacobs, the first
Dutch woman student, launched a peti-
tion for the legislative vote in 1883, The
first big campaign organized by the"As-
sociation for Women's Suffrage", on the
occasion of a bill for constitutional
reform, took place in 1905, Dutchwomen
became eligible for election in 1917, and
voters in 1919,
The year 1848-the date of the Con-
vention of Seneca Falls-was a landmark
in the history of Feminism in America.
This Convention was the direct result of
the Anti-slavery Congress held in London.
In the early'thirties, Lucretia Nott had
launched her antislavery campaign, and
neither insults nor threats of death pre-
vented her from speaking.
When, in 1840, an International Con-
gress for the Abolition of Slavery met in
London, L. Nott went there with Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and Elizabeth Pease. But
they were stopped from entering the hall,
and only tolerated as listeners in the gal-
lery,"Very well !" exclaimed Elizabeth
Cady Stanton,"as soon as we get back to
America we will call a meeting to discuss
Woman's slavery". And, indeed, immed-
iately after their return, henceforth
convinced that the abolition of political
incapacity was the key to the abolition of
all other disabilities, they set to work.
The movement now relied on the sup-
port of societies founded in the different
States. In 1848, the delegates assembled
at Seneca Falls voted in favour of a
Convention : since the Government only
exists to safeguard the inalienable rights
of men and women,"if it fails in this
essential duty, the governed may legi-
timately withdraw their allegiance". The
following year, the"National Convention
for Electoral Suffrage"was founded.
After the Civil War, Negrc slavery was
abolished. But women were not include

leader of the Movement, considered the
right should be claimed in the federal
sphere.
In 1872, she took part with fourteen
other women in the federal elections at
Rochester. She was arrested and brought
before the magistrate. Her offence was
to have voted without having the lcol
right to do so. She was sentenced to pay
a fine of 100 dollars, but refused to pay.
Some years later, the"National Asso-
ciation for Women's Suffrage"had be-
come the heart of a solid and powerful
organization. Each year, a Congress
brought together delegates from all over
the Union. At the Congress held in
Washington in 1888, the idea of an Inter-
national Women's Association was put
forward. Five years later, at Chicago, the
"International Women's Council"was
formed, to which all countries gradually
became affiliated.

triple cradle of Feminism, were the
countries in which the struggle for the
vote was to be the longest and the most
arduous.
In Manchester, England, in 1905, Sir
Edward Grey, who was presiding over an
important electoral meeting, had just
finished his speech."When do you
intend giving the vote to Englishwomen ?"
shouted a woman. For the first time, the
"Women's Political and Social Union"
had made its voice heard. At the head
of it was Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst who,
tired of false promises by the Govern-
ment, had decided to go into action with
her adherents. Thenceforward,"suffra-
gettes"were to use direct methods of
agitation ; causing uproar at political
meetings, demonstrating outside Parlia-
ment, badgering ministers even at the
theatre and in drawing-rooms, organizing
mass parades.
From 1912 onwards, exasperated by
persistent obstruction in Parliament, their
action became more violent. But when
war came, their one thought was to work
for victory, following which they were
given the right to vote.
In 1917, in order to obtain the vote, the
little group of American"Militants"went
Into ö"Lion On 10 January, 12 women,
carrying banners H--ibed with their
claims, took up their stand, and

then released. They immediately return-
ed to take up their watch. This time
they were sent to prison, for they refused
to pay the fine.
Courageous as these women were, it
was, nevertheless, not their spectacular
efforts but persistent and often obscure
work on the part of the mass of American
Feminists-of which the"Militants"
formed only a small fraction-which
finally gave American women their rights
of citizenship.
Ever since 1780, the public monuments
of France have been inscribed with the
words : Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. But
though the Chamber of Deputies was pre-
pared, from 1925 onwards, to give real
liberty to women and to place them on an
equality, the Senate fiercely opposed any
change. The year 1944 however, saw the
liberation of France and the granting of
the vote to Frenchwomen.
What a long way we have come espe-
cially, since the beginning of the century !
Women have proved their worth in every
field.
Yet, in spite of an equality accepted in
principle, custom, prejudices and material
conditions still prevail which tend to re-
establish a measure of inequality. This
must be fought against."We now have
to proclaim", as M. Jaime Torres Bodet
has urged,"that mankind needs-and
needs urgently-the active intervention of
women, who have at last attained their
majority. It is the recognition of a right,
of a hard-won dignity, to give women the
means of complete self-development and
self-determination ; it is also the response
to a vital need of to-day".

UNESCO COURIER-Page 10 DECEMBER 1951
FRENCH PRESIDENT PAY ST RIB UTE
TO U. N. SPECIALIZED AGENCIES
OPENING the Sixth Session of theUnited Nations General Assembly, in
Paris last month, M. Vincent Auriol,
President of the French Repmbuc, paid a
tribute to the work of the United Nations
Specialized Agencies, each of which, he said,
was"a positive centre of peace and co-
operation."
In his speech, M. Auriol declared :
"When, six years ago, at the end of an
appalling war and when its lessons were
still in everyone's mind, the Charter was
signed unanimously, it appeared that the
struggle for peace and for collective secur-
ity was inseparable from the struggle
against ignorance, disease and poverty, and
that by working for economic, social, legal
and intellectual progress in every form and
on a world-wide scale we would thereby
eliminate the causes of conflict and create
conditions favourable for the political solu-
tion of the problems of peace.
"Since then a great volume of work has
been done by the Councils of the United
Nations and by Specialized Agencies, the
activities and number of which show a
gratifying tendency to increase, and whose
work in all too many cases is practically
unknown to the public. I have had
occasion in the past to stress this fact before
those non-governmental organizations
which have made themselves responsible
for spreading knowledge of the United
Nations and providing them with the es-
sential backing of the peoples'will. We
must use all the modern media of infor-
mation to make more and more people
aware of the reality of the United Nations
and all its work. Thus we shall convince
the sceptical, the hesitant and the luke-
warm and those who regard the interna-
tional community as a remote utopia devoid
of any immediate or practical significance.
"It is fitting to mention the work done
by the Specialized Agencies in the field of
labour, agricultural development and public
health. People must no longer, for
example, be unaware of the millions of
children who have been saved and the mil-
lions of children immunized against tuber-
culosis thanks to the gigantic campaign
undertaken by the Children's Emergency
Fund and the International Children's
Centre. People must be made aware of the
fact that the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization-
Unesco- ! has not only reduced illiteracy
by mutiplying centres of basic education but
has prepared the way for universal and
wholehearted co-operation by co-ordinating
the work of international associations of
specialists and by promoting the free
movement of persons and scientific mate-'
rial for educational and cultural purposes.
"Each of those organizations is a positive
centre of peace and co-operation together
with the Councils directly dependent upon
the United Nations itself ; they are the
effective instruments of the fine and ex-
panding programme of technical assistance
for economic development, social welfare
and public administration. Each day they
add more reality to the Universal Decla-
ration of Human Rights which was
approved unanimously by your Assembly
in 1948 and the simultaneous supervised
and sincere application of which by all the
signatory countries would suffice to provide
the world with an era of peace and secu-
rity and prosperity without precedence in
history."
THE PRECOGNITION OF MAN'S
ECONOM) C RtGHTS
by Gunnar Myrdal
Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe
IN modern legal and sociolog-
. ical doctrine, it is generally
acknowledged that declar-
ations of those rights which,
following on habeas corpus, were
evolved by the revolutionary
thinking of the eighteenth cen-
tury, are not in themselves enough
to secure respect for the liberties
of the individual ; if they are to
have any real meaning, the
proclamation of constitutional
liberties must be backed by
recognition of the economic rights
which it is the duty of any
society to guarantee to its citizens.
No one would seriously ques-
tion today, for example, that
freedom in law and freedoms
from governmental or administ-
rative tyranny cannot be regarded
as man's greatest good if the vast
majority of citizens, while having
such freedom, are allowed to die
from starvation.
Today we believe that constitu-
tional and legal liberties should
be combined with the right of
every citizen to look to the society
of which he is a member for the
satisfaction, through its economic
and social organization, of his
vital needs in the cultural,
economic and social spheres.
The development of theory in
this respect has had a profound
effect on practice. The most
recent constitutions containing a
declaration of human rights
include, in addition to the classic
freedoms, a number of clauses
setting forth the right of the
individual to a decent standard
of living, to work and to social
security.
FAITH PLUS ACTION
THE Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, proclaimed
by the General Assembly
of the United Nations, follows
the same course. Its Articles
22 to 25 give international re-
cognition to a series of prin-
ciples providing a basis for
the"realization, through national
effort and international cooper-
ation, and in accordance with the
organization and resources of
each State, of the economic,
social and cultural rights in-
dispensable for the dignity (of
every individual as a member of
society) and the free development
of his personality." (Article 22.)
It may be wondered whether
the list of economic rights on
which the attainment of these
aims depends, given in the above-
mentioned Articles of the Uni-
versal Declaration, should not be
fuller. In any case, it must be
admitted that the very fact of
including economic rights in the
Declaration contributes to the
credit of the United Nations in
their unstinted endeavours in this
field.
But these efforts must go
further. It is not enough to
proclaim the common faith of
the Members of the United
Nations in the validity of the
rights. set forth in the. necJrti : :.'n ;
all governments must take steps,
in the words of the Preamble to
the Declaration, to secure their
universal and effective recogni-
tion and observance, both among
their own peoples and among
those of territories under their
jurisdiction.
The importance of this question
of the effective observance of
Human Rights has been fully
recognized by the United Nations.
But, while observance of the
succeed
in their
efforts to
bring
about
such im-
provements
in organi-
zation and
the use of
resour-
c e s will
determine their ability to enforce
observance of the principles they
have acknowledged in those Ar-
ticles of the Universal Declara-
tion which refer to the economic
rights of men and women.
All the efforts of the subsidiary
bodies of the United Nations in
economic and social affairs are
more or less directly connected
with the pursuit of this long-
term aim-the recognition and
observance of man's economic
rights. This is the purpose of
the work the International Labour
Organization has been doing for
the past thirty years to promote
social legislation in the different
countries of the world and to
ARTICLE 22. Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social
security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and inter-
national co-operation and in accordance with the organization and
resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights
indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.
traditionally conceived civic
liberties can be secured by evolv-
ing a procedure for international
supervision of the way in which
each of the Member countries
is carrying out the principles
embodied in the Universal
Declaration, far more construc-
tive action has to be taken if we
are to bring about the effective
recognition of economic rights.
When the United Nations
specified, in Article 22 of the
Declaration, that the realization
of economic rights should be
achieved in accordance with the
organization and resources of
each country, they were not
simply stating a truism ; they
were indicating clearly that, if
the proclamation of those rights
in the Declaration is to have any
force, it is essential to perfect
the organization and develop
the economic resources of the
Member States. The extent to
which the United Nations
bring these laws into line with
one another. The Economic and
Social Council has the same end
in view when it seeks for
practical measures to secure full
employment or when, in consult-
ation with the various Specialized
Agencies, it studies ways of
financing economic and social
progress in under-developed
areas. And, lastly, the regional
economic commissions, jointly
or individually, are likewise
pursuing the same aim in seeking,
in agreement with Member
Governments, means to increase
production in each of the coun-
tries concerned, to expand con-
sumption, and to organize in-
ternational trade between them.
These various undertakings
are not all at the same stage of
development. Some of them, like
those of the International Labour
Organization, already have a long
list of achievements to their
credit. Others, such as those of
the regional Economic Com-
missions, though still in their
early stages, are likely, because
of the daily contacts that are
possible between the Commis-
sions and the governments con-
cerned, to produce tangible results
in the near future.
ECONOMIC CHARTER
OUR efforts to bring about theeconomic and social reha-
bilitation of the under-
developed countries, which are
planned on a wider scale and
faced with far more serious
practical difficulties, will certain-
ly take much longer. But the
results it is possible to achieve
in this sphere, thanks to the
readiness of governments to co-
operate, will have even greater
meaning for the future of the
world.
There is, however, this in
common between all the efforts I
have described : when practical
difficulties are encountered, or if
some governments decline to
play their part in international
economic co-operation, it is now
possible, since the adoption of
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights by the General
Assembly, to remind them that
effective co-operation in the effort
to find ways of raising the
standard of the world's economy
follows naturally from the prin-
ciples set forth in Articles 22 to
25 of the Declaration.
The Declaration may therefore
be regarded as a real charter of
international co-operation in
economic matters or, at all
events, as an invitation to the
governments which are Members
of the United Nations to take
effective action to implement the
principles they have formally
approved. This is surely a feature
to which attention may well be
drawn on this third anniversary
of the Universal Declaration.

FOUR SUPREME
HUMAN FREEDOMS
By
Sir Robert Watson Watt, F. R. S.
THE Universal Declaration of
Human Rights necessarily cov-
JL ers a range of rights nd free-
doms so vast, so very universal.
that if they are not to merge into an
impressive but remote-seeming nebula.
each must be picked out for selective
examination by someone specially
concerned. Everyone is interested in
and affected by every Article of the
Declaration. But each of us can find
at least one Article bearing with
peculiar directness on his own fears,
hopes and faiths.
I trust that I shall not be calling
down on my head the opprobrious
epithet"intellectual"if I declare that
for me the majority of the Articles of
the Universal Declaration primarily
delineate a solid foundation of bodily
and material securities on which must
rest the supreme freedoms of Articles
18, 19, 26 and 27.
The foundation is indispensable, for
even the most freely soaring mind,
spirit or soul must, within the mea-
sure of those Articles, be ground-
based. But if the material securities
are to be truly secure, if they are to
become universal-they are still
lamentably circumscribed even in the
liberal parts of our broadly liberal
world of today-they will do so only
by the exercise of the intellectual
rights.
It is no empty paradox to say that
though the growth of the intellectual
freedoms cannot be assure save on a
minimal foundation of material seca-
rities, yet these material securities are
continuously dependent on the full
enjoyment of the intellectual free-
doms It is not merely that man
cannot live by bread alone ; it is that
the bread itself is menaced by res-
traint on the freedoms of the mind.
In the interests of that de-nebuli-
sation which I think important to
effective application of the Declara-
tion, I go so far as to select even
from within those Articles which I
regard as the keystones of its arch.
Article 18 declares that"Everyone has
the right to freedom of tho''e ; ht-
to change his belief-to manifest his
belief in teaching, practice-."Arti-
cle 19 declares that"Everyone has the
right to freedom of opinion and ex-
pression-to hold opinions without
interference-to seek, receive and
impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of fron-
tiers."
Right to
Be'Wrong'
THE rights thus claimed include
that highest of human rights,
the right to be"wrong", to
adhere to those heresies through
which minorities, often oppressed, ini-
tially almost always minorities of one,
have changed the face of the world,
physical and spiritual. They include
the right to exercise the ill-appreciated
courage of the"turncoat", which is
only another name for a convert, and
the right to preach"false"and.. sUb-
versive"doctrines. There are sadly
few communities sufficiently adult
fully to cede these rights within their
own frontiers-regardless of the
frontiers of others.
This is the unfamiliar and never
wholly welcome face of the medal. The
other face is familiar, welcome, but it
too is more especially welcome in its
application to the other side of the
frontier. It is the transcendently
important one of unrestricted access
to basic knowledge and ideas, access
to every channel of ephemeral publi-
cation, to books, to meetings, confe-
rences and debates, to cinema films, to
radio broadcasting, all"regardless of
frontiers".
To the scientific worker this used to
be almost a platitude. He never
doubted that science could only
advance healthily as a wholly interna-
tional enterprise. He never, save as a
minor and gratifying diversion, cata-
logued the nationalities of those who
contributed to the ever-growing stock
of sure scientific knowledge and to
the fertilising accessions of hypothe-
sis, reasoned speculation, and critical
appreciation.
He was humanly happy when some-
one in another country provided evid-
ence in support of his hypothesis ;
he was inspired to higher flights by
evidence which failed to fit. The
greatest blow that has been struck
against the growth of science is the
restriction, whether on political, mili-
tary or economic grounds, which has
in recent years been imposed on the
international interchange of basic
scientific thought.
A Radical
Antidote
ARTICLE 26 declares that"Every-
one has the right to education-
directed to the fill development
of the human personality and to the
strengthening of respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms-to
promote understanding, tolerance and
friendship".
"Article 27-freely to participate
in the cultural life of the community,
to enjoy the arts and to share in
scientific advancement and its bene-
fits."
Article 26 is, in fact, the radical
antidote to this disease of restrictive
practices in international science. A
liberal education, in the true sense of
encouraging and feeding a wide, well-
balanced appreciation of the greatest
triumphs of the human spirit in every
field of endeavour, is the only real
cure for the disease of intellectual
isolationism, with its inevitable sequel
of intellectual sterility. It is not a
lightning cure, but it is worth persist-
ing with the treatment for a couple
of centuries or so-then we shall
really see worthwhile results.
Meanwhile Article 27 prescribes a
sustaining diet which will help the
patient to live a reasonably full and
useful life. And these four articles
together provide a goal for intellectual
and spiritual advances that would on
the one hand be a superb harvest
from the earthy fields which are safe-
gilarded by the other articles, and on
the other world enrich these same
fields to a still higher level of human
satisfaction and legitimate human
pride.
Formerly, the scientific worker never doubted that sciences could only advance healthily as a wholly
International enterprise. In recent years, however, science has suffered through the restriction, on
various grounds, of the international exchange of basic scientific thought.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION
(Continued from page 2)
The exchange of knowledge between peoples began early in history and developed concurrently
with the growth of travel. One example, shown above in an 18th century engraving, was the setting
up of an observatory in Pekin, by the Jesuit Fathers. Today, the right to seek, receive and impart
information and ideas regardless of frontiers remains an indispensable condition of human progress.
To grant these States the right
to a special system, wherein the
obligations would be less strict
than in the case of affiliated
States, would be a breach of the
equality and reciprocity which are
the corner-stones of international
relations. To refuse to grant such
a right, however, would bring
about a very long delay in the
ratification of the Covenant by
such States, and in its extension
throughout the world. Hence the
need for a fresh solution, which
has not so far been found.
In point of fact, all the diffi-
culties I have described can be
summed up more or less as
follows. To what extent will
"sovereign"States consent to
waive their"sovereignty"in the
interests of the world-wide advan-
cement of human rights ? Their
present position rather resembles
that of the fathers of families in
ancient times, who had power of
life and death over the other
members of the tribe or the
domus, and who lost the more
menacing features of their pa-
ternal authority only gradually,
through the influence of custom,
as they were integrated into the
larger social group of the city or
State.
We cannot and must not hope
that all the attributes of State
authority will be transferred to an
organized human community ; and
such a hope would be illusory.
But the international protection of
human rights, which at the be-
ginning of the nineteenth century
took the form of a systematic
campaign against the slave-
traders, can surely not fail to show
equal vigour under the auspices of
the United Nations Charter, whose
purpose is to prevent the reap-
pearence of some new Hitler.
Merely to put the question is to
answer it. If human rights are
gravely injured in any one part of
the world, nothing can prevent the
united race of Mankind from feel-
ing the smart. Implementation of
those rights is, therefore, simply a
matter of time and of the deter-
mination of the different peoples,
which must be upheld by the tech-
nical procedure of the law.
But, speaking of technical pro-
cedure, we should surely rely at
least as much on constructive co-
operation as on abstract super-
vision, censure, or coercion.
For there are many States that
are not even in a position to
implement, by their own unaided
efforts, human rights so univers-
ally accepted nowadays as the
right of every child or adult to be
taught to read and write and
receive fundamental education. It
is not by inveighing against these
States that we can fill the gaps in
their educational organization ; it
is by helping them without hurting
their feelings or interfering with
their independence-by means of
international intellectual, tech-
nical and financial co-operation.
The Commission on Human Rights
has understood this, and its
Covenant, especially those clauses
dealing with the right to education
and to the benefits of culture, is
pervaded by that positive spirit
which informs Unesco's plans and
must take precedence over the
negative spirit of stricture or
censure.
The struggle for human rights
has been going on for centuries.
The setbacks which have only too
often occurred were perhaps due
to a lack of unity among the
various social or national groups,
and to insufficient pressure by
public opinion.
To conclude : the future imple-
mentation of human rights will go
hand in hand with the peaceful
and resolute extension of co-
operation between individuals and
groups, within the vast framework
of the international institutions.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 12 DECEMBER 1951
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION-A COLLECTIVE RIGHT
by Fernand Terrou
Legal Adviser
to the French Cabinet
FREEDOM of expression is among the foremost 0"human rights. It is the continuation and practical
application of per. sonal freedom of thought. The
manner in which it is envisaged is therefore a funda-
mental element of any system of social organization.
Hence, the principle of such freedom must necessarily
be set forth more or less explicitly in any social covenant,
whatever its form-whether it be derived from custom or
determined by a written constitution.
It is thus that, at the present time, these various written
constitutions, irrespective of the system of administration
that they establish, all make mention-either in their texts
or in the legal preambles which precede them-of freedom
of expression, though the terminology employed is variable.
And when the administration is founded on common law,
freedom of expression is among those essential principles
of government which general practice, the attitude of the
authorities and the vigilance of the courts apply with as
much exactitude as, and in an even more concrete form
than if they had been enshrined in a written constitution.
The principle of freedom of expression, thus stated or
emerging, and the concept therein set forth, must as a
matter of course determine the legal system to be applied
to the various vehicles of expression, the mass media of
information. While freedom of thought is a personal
freedom, freedom of expression is a collective freedom,
whose character in this respect becomes more and more
pronouncea as tne great tecnnlcal
methods of diffusion multiply and
improve.
In the case of individual liberties,
such as freedom of thought or security
of the person, the legal system need
do no more than guard against any
attempt to interfere with the behaviour
of the individual, other than those
controls necessary to social order.
Collective freedoms involve a more
extensive and complex treatment, in
so far as they require the use of
considerable material resources. The
legal system must then determine the
use to be made of these resources, the
collective instruments and organiza-
tions required by such use, the
guarantees which must be furnished
for the protection of individual rights
within the framework of such
organizations and, if need be, the
policy to be pursued by these latter in
the public interest.
"Everyone has the right... to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of fron-
tiers,"While with the press, the film and the radio (above) there has been an increase in the means of propagating
ideas, the means of controlling and checking this propagation have today also become much more refined.
nor under the same conditions in the
field of radio or even, sometimes, in
that of the cinema, as it is in the
field of the press. The constitutional
expression of the principle of freedom
of expression is the first evidence of
this.
Certain constitutional provisions,
and especially the most recent, are,
however, wider in their scope ; such,
for instance, is that contained in the
Constitution of the Saar, which
guarantees freedom of expression
whether oral, written, pictorial, or of
any other nature... Yet another
formula has recently arisen and
gained a footing, at any rate on
the international plane ; it is that
enshrined in them, they generally men-
tion only those elements which affect
the actual extent of the right of public
utterance, leaving out all those which
concern the material resources required
for that purpose. Now, freedom of the
press or freedom of information, is a
collective freedom, a group freedom.
Its exercise involves, in the ordinary
way, recourse to collective organiza-
tions and Instruments.
It is true that the magnitude of
the material resources needed for the
exercise of freedom of expression
through the press, and the consequent
scale of the collective organizations
and instruments, did not become fully
evident until the end of the nine-
Three Terms-One Idea
THE concept of freedom of expres-sion regarded as a principle is
merged with the concept of the
use that may be made of the resources
and technical methods essential to the
practical expression of this freedom.
This appears from the very termino-
logy employed. While certain consti-
tutional provisions guarantee freedom
of expression, others in the same
context, mention only the freedom of
the press, which strictly speaking, is
the oldest-established of the great
media of diffusion.
The advent of new technical methods
of information (radio and cinema)
has not, however, affected these for-
mulae, because-and this simple
examination of constitutional ter-
minology brings us straight to the
dominant fact of our whole theme-
generally speaking, freedom of ex-
pression is not guaranteed so fully,
ARTICLE 19. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expres-
sion ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any

of freedom of information, which
primarily applies to freedom of expres-
sion in every form, and more especially
in those forms which correspond to
the three great technical media of
diffusion. In any case the terms
freedom of expression, freedom of the
press and freedom of information all
express one and the same primary
idea.
A Group Freedom
EXAMINING these constitutionalprovisions on the tech ical pla e,
however, we discover, that even
when they specify the constituent
elements of the notion of freedom
The invention of printing in the fifteenth century placed a formidable weapon in the hands of innovators and
reformers, whose resources increased with the spread of pamphlets and later, periodical, Today, great
newspapers are more vulnerable than were the slim pamphlets of the past, and the policing of frontiers has
everywhere become more effective. True democracy, however, can only exist where free availability of informationand the freedom of the press are assured.
teenth century. Whence it might be
deduced that constitutional instru-
ments, which in many cases date from
an earlier period, could not apply to
them. But since then, at least under
certain systems, nothing has been
done to complete them in this respect.
Yet the press has developed con-
siderably ; it has become both a trade
and an industry, requiring costly
materials-all the more costly
since progress and improvements are
constant. Alongside the strictly
political factor involved in the defini-
tion and regulation of collective
freedom of expression, and which
results simply in laying down the
boundaries of the field left open to
Iree inmauve, leaving
individuals and groups
free to select the ideas
or news-items that
they may wish to cir-
culate, there now ap-
pears the economic
factor, which affects
the very organization
of the material resour-
ces now required for
the use of that right,

functions and activi-
ties it involves.
A first glance leads
one to the conclusion
that the manner in
which these resources
are, or may be, made
use of is an element
almost as important
as regards the extent
of freedom of expres-
sion as is the political
factor. The distinc-
tion between these two
elements dominates
the whole of the legis-
lation regarding the
press and information
services.
Free Enterprise
THROUGH, precis) yin those constitu-
tional provisions
the economic factor is
not mentioned save as
an exception, this is
not due to an oversight.
It is because, as vie
have seen, the systems
set up by those provi-
sions do not admit the
existence of an econo-
mic factor peculiar to
the press, of such nature as to call for
the separate treatment of newspaper
enterprises, and thus to add special
provisions concerning the rights of
expression.
These constitutional systems are
founded on the principle of freedom
of trade and industry. It is true that
they provide for the regulation of that
liberty-regulation which, in certain
sectors, goes so far as to annul it.
But they always provide a fairly
broad sector of economic activity
where the regulations are as few and
as elastic as possible, to avoid hamper-
ing initiative and the spirit of private
enterprise.
To
Uneasy Speculation
HE sector of free enterprise is thevery exp ession, one might say 
embodiment, of the economic po-
licy which characterizes the systems
mentioned. And the very essence of
that concept of freedom of the press
and of information, upon which these
systems are based, is the assumption
that press undertakings belong to the
sector of free enterprise.
There was therefore no need to
include any special provision for this
in those passages of the constitutions
which define freedom of expression ;
the general principle was sufficient,
since it applies to the newspaper
industry as to all others.
Nevertheless this principle is relaxed
or even dropped in respect of radio
and cinema, where constitutional
provisions carry little weight. As
regards newspaper undertakings them-
selves, uneasy speculation has been
aroused, even in those countries most
attached to the principle of free enter-
prise, concerning the possible reper-
cussions of this economic factor upon
freedom of expression. And, in any
case, every system has some special
provisions relating to newspaper
enterprises.
These systems are based on the
principle of free expression that we
have already described, on the in-
dependence of the press from the
political authorities and, in principle,
on free enterprise. The special
provisions applicable to newspaper
undertakings which they include, or
which may arise out of the concepts
embodied in them, in no way tend, at
any rate in the reasons or explana-
tions given for them, to ensure or
promote the subordination of the press
to the political authority to entrust
the supervision or guidance of public
opinion to that authority, or to place
the enterprise under its control. Their
main effect is or would be to ensure
either the economic independence
of newspaper undertakings, or the
practical application of those res-
ponsibilities which go hand in hand
with true freedom. And those which
are found to be the most usually
accepted or recommended are or would
be aimed at giving full effect to
freedom of expression and information.
Freedom of information has a
double aspect. In the first place, it
implies the liberty to issue and to
disseminate ideas and news, without
unjustified restriction. In the second
place, it implies the right of every
individual to be fully informed. The
liberty to be informed is the necessary
corollary of the liberty to supply
information.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 14 DECEMBER 1951
THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNIVERSAL
DECLARATION
Delegates to the United Nations General Assembly met in the main hall of
the Palais de Chaillot, Paris on the night of December 10, to vote the adoption
of the ! Universal Declaration of Human Rights. M. Emile St. Lot of Haiti,
Rapporteur of the Third Committee, who presented the Declaration to the
Assembly, described it as"the greatest effort of humanity to find new moral
and juridical bases founded on liberty, equality and fraternity."
ON 10 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nationsadopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights'''was a common standard of achievement for all peoples and
all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society,
keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and
education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by pro-
gressive measures, national and international, to secure theist-universal
and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of
Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under
their jurisdiction".
It was approaching midnight when the vote was taken. The repre-
sentatives of fifty-six Governments were seated in the main Assembly
hall of the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. After two years of laborious
study and discussion, after countless meetings of drafting groups, com-
mittees, and commissions, after seemingly endless hearings and debates,
after hundreds of amendments and a thousand statements, a single final
document had emerged bearing the symbol number A/777. It was the
draft text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One after
another the representatives rose to present the viewpoint of their govern-
ments on this proclamation of human rights. Although opinions varied
as to its substance and form, the Declaration was adopted without a dis-
senting vote by the supreme organ of the international community (1).
One representative after another affirmed that what was being done
was of immense historical significance, destined to have far-reaching
effects on the lives of men and of nations. This was not only the view-
point of individual representatives. It was the sense of the Assembly
itself in formally resolving that"the adoption of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights is an historic act, destined to consolidate
world peace through the contribution of the United Nations towards the
liberation of individuals from the unjustified oppression and constraint
to which they are too often subjected".
Within the short time since its proclamation the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights has had a marked impact on the thought and action
of individuals and organizations, on teaching and education, and on
progressive measures, both national and international to promote a more
effective recognition and observance of the rights and freedoms proclaim-
ed therein. These are the developments the Secretary-General of the
United Nations had in mind when he said in October 1950 that'''it 1s
becoming increasingly evident that the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights is destined to become one of the great documents or. history".
rights, racial persecution will be end-
ed". A series of pronouncements-in
the Atlantic Charter, 1941, in the
United Nations Declaration of 1943,
and at the Dumbarton Oaks Confer-
ence, 1944-gave expression to the
aspirations of the Allied nations that
in the postwar world the promotion
and protection of human rights should
be an accepted aim of national and
international conduct.
The Charter not only affirmed faith
in human rights-it required the
United Nations to promote them. It
imposed a legal obligation on all its
Members to take joint and separate
action in co-operation with the United
Nations Organization for the achieve-
ment of this purpose. It established
machinery to perform the functions of
promoting human rights. The Charter
of the United Nations, in fact, laid the
foundations of a plan of human rights,
conceived, drawn up and put into
effect as a part of the most widespread
attempt at international co-operation
of all time. The first part of this
plan, and so far the most important,
was the drafting and adoption of the
Universal Declaration or, Human
Rights.
The Aroused
Conscience of mankind
IN the Charter, the Economic andSocial ouncil was required to set
up a commission for the promotion
of human rights. This was done early
in 1946. After its establishment the
Commission on Human Rights began
its monumental task of incorporating
the aims and aspirations of the peoples
of the world into an international bill
of rights. It was the first time such a
task had been contemplated or at
thorized by the organized who. ;
community. It was agreed that t1iè
bill of rights would consist of a
universal declaration of human rights,
a covenant on human rights and
measures of implementation.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights in the opening words of its
Preamble reflects the actual conditions
from which it emerged. It speaks of
the fact that"recognition of the
inherent dignity and of the equal and
inalienable rights of all members of
the human family is the foundation of
freedom, justice and peace in the
world". It then goes on to recall how.. ard and contempt for human
rights have resulted in barbarous acts
which have outraged the conscience of
mankind", and how"the advent of a
world in which human beings shall
enjoy freedom of peech and belief and
freedom from fear and want has been
proclaimed as the highest aspiration of
the common people". These passages
- the last taken from the Atlantic
Charter-provide the first reason for
the unique authority of the Declara-
tion : it was born out of a life and
death struggle of the peoples of the
world against tyranny and oppression.
It represented the highest aspirations
of the common people.
Rights Without
Discrimination'
BUT a second element contributed toits unique authority. Its applica-
tion is universal. The rights pro-
claimed are rights to which everyone is
entitled,"without distinction of any
kind, such as race, sex, language, reli-
gion, political or other opinion, na-
tional or social origin, property, birth
or other status". This is a list of
things that cannot or should not inter-
fere with your rights. It is taken
from Article 2 of the Universal
Declaration. The Article prescribes
full equality. Everyone is entitled to
all the rights and freedoms set forth
in this Declaration without distinction
of any kind. The list that follows
enumerates the grounds or pretexts on
the basis of which enjoyment of rights
at one time or other, in some place or
other, has been denied. It is not an
exhaustive list. It merely enumerates
the most frequent cases of discrimina-
tion.
The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights stands firmly against all types
of discrimination and proclaims rights
and freedoms for all. It may be noted
that special reference is made to one
(1) The Declaration was adopted by forty-eight VO"te8 in against and
eight abstention.
THE struggle for human rights has1 gone on fr m the beginning
of recorded time. History has
marked the efforts of the seers and
prophets, the philosophers, the saw-
givers, the statesmen and the martyrs
in voicing demands for a larger
freedom. But the nerve centre or. the
struggle for human rights is to be
found in the people themselves, tn the
attempts of ordinary men and women
to establish their claim to a decent,
unmolested life in the face of des-
potism and bigotry, of ignorance and
intolerance, of superstition and
tyranny. Sometimes the struggle has
been hard-fought and the casualties
have been high. Sometimes it has
surged forward on the irresistible tide
of a free and responsible democracy.
The establishment of the United
Nations was a high point in the age-
long battle for human rights. For in
its Charter the representatives of all
the signatory States pledged their
governments"to promote universal
respect for and observance of human
rights and fundamental freedoms for
all without distinction as to race, sex,
language or religion".
The rise of Fascism and Nazism had
been a ruthless challenge to the
advance in the democratic process
which assured the individual of an
"'-broadMftbg'1llâ for the exercise
of his rights at a free person. In
Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, and
the countries brought under their
domination, the individual was stripped
of his civil rights, subjected to police
tyranny and condemned to brutal
oppression on grounds of race and
religion. During the Second World
War, a campaign of systematic
extermination was directed against
members of the Jewish community in
Germany, a savage campaign for
which human history can provide
few parallels. Political freedom dis-
appeared ; the power of the State
became absolute.
As the war progressed and war
objectives began to form, the leaders
of the Allied nations, reflecting the
aroused conscience of their peoples,
Insisted that the foundations of peace
must be built on a respect for human
rights. President Franklin D. Roose-
velt expressed such an objective in his
Four Freedoms message to Congress in
1941-"freedom of speech, freedom of
worship, freedom from want and fear,
everywhere in the world". The Pre-
sident's statement was matched by
that of Winston Churchill, Britain's
war-time Prfme Minister, who prom-
ised that"when this struggle ends
with the enthronement of human
very common type of discrimination-
discrimination practised against groups
of people who belong to a territory
which is not fully autonomous. The
Declaration states in Article 2 that
"no discrimination shall be made on
the basis of the political, jurisdictional
or international status of the country
or territory to which a person belongs,
whether this territory be an in-
dependent, Trust, Non-Self-Governing
Territory, or under any other limita-
tion of sovereignty".
New Rights and Old
A THIRD feature of the UniversalDeclaration which adds to its
intrinsic authority is the broad
range of the rights and freedoms it
proclaims. For the first time in history
a comprehensive system of human
rights is given international recogni-
tion. The Declaration not only incor-
porates the great victories of the past- victories in the field of free thought
and opinion, victories which won for
the common man the right to free
assembly and association, to freedom
from arbitrary arrest and the right to
a fair trial. These great traditional
rights had already been proclaimed in
the historic declarations of human
rights and were, of course, Included in
the Universal Declaration. But the
Universal Declaration points beyond
these traditional rights to the more
recently defined and recognized social,
cultural and economic rights-the
right to work, the right to l sec-
urity, to education, to healthy. and an
adequate standard of living, to full
parttciJ) ation in the cultural life of the
community.,
Many national constitutions drawn
up in this century offer guarantees of
employment, unemployment insurance,
old-age and sickness benefits, and free
education. Moreover, in recent legisla-
tion is. many countries, increasing
stress has been laid on these gua-
rantees. But the economic, cultural
and social rights set forth in articles
22-27 of the Declaration have not yetbeen fully realized. The Declaration
defines with clarity and with authority
those rights which have, in a sense,
been created by the very complexity
and change of social and economic
conditions of the twer. tieth century. It
attempts to match newly recognized
needs with norms of conduct arising
out of the awakened social conscience
of mankind. The articles in the Dec-
laration setting forth these rights
mark an evolution in social and juri-
dical thinking and at the same time
define a goal,"a standard of achieve-
ment", by which mankind may judge
its progress.
There is a fourth reason for the
unique authority of the Universal Dec-
laration, and perhaps it is the most
significant of all. At the time of the
adoption of the Dec1aration, the Pre-
sident of the General Assembly, Her-
bert Vere Evatt of Australia, said :
"It is the first occasion on which the
organized community of nations has
made a declaration of human rights
and fundamental freedoms, and it has
the authority of the body of opinion
of the United Nations as a whole, and
millions of men, women and children
all over the world, many miles from
Paris and New York, will turn for
help, guidance and inspiration to this
document".
Herein lies the greatest significance
of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights : it is a Declaration, not of one
person or group of persons, not of one
nation or of one people, but of the
organized community of nations and
of all the peoples throughout the
world.
The General Assembly in the open-
ing paragraph of the Declaration itself
set as the goal of this new inter-
national action"that every individual
and every organ of society, keeping
this Declaration constantly in mind
shall strive by teaching and education
to promote respect for these rights
and freedoms and by progressive
measures, national and international,
to secure their universal and effective
recognition and observance".

DOCUMENTS OF FREEDOM
Behind the origin of the human rights affirmed in the Universal Declaration,is every country's story of the long struggle by its people for various
kinds of freedom. These stories vary from country to country, but for
centuries people everywhere have fought for what they considered their
inalienable rights. Their victories are commemorated in such documents
as the Magna Carta, the Habeas Corpus Act, the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen, the Declaration of Independence, and, in our own
time, the Charter of the United Nations. On this page we publish photographs
of some of these"Documents of Freedom", each of which has contributed
its share to the principles proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of 1948.

Knowledge and understanding of the principles ofthe Universal Dec-laration of Human Rights and their practical application must begin
during childhood. Efforts to make known the rights and duties they
imply will never be fully effective unless schools in all countries make
teaching about the Declaration a regular part of the curriculum. One of
the countries where such action has been taken is the Republic of the
Philippines whose Education Department has prepared a simplified
