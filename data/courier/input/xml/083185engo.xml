TO OUR READERS
Jince the Unesco Courier was launched over forty years ago profound transformations
have taken place in the scope and limits of human knowledge, in forms of creativity,
in the power of communications, and in ways of teaching and learning. Everywherein
the North as in the South, in the West as in the Eastthe pace of life and work is acceler¬
ating. People belong to an increasingly close network of reciprocal influences and in¬
tellectual exchange. They may seek different forms of fulfilment, see the world in different
terms and have unequal chances of success and failure, but they feel more and more strongly
that they share a common destiny.
It is part of Unesco's mission to foster this awareness by encouraging a spirit of mutual
respect and solidarity. The Unesco Courier was created to be a mainspring of this process.
Over the years it has been produced in conditions which have sometimes been favour¬
able, sometimes less so. There have been occasions when, in the face of international
tensions, much perseverance has been required to keep the magazine firmly targeted
on its course as an instrument of hope and understanding.
Now a new chapter in the history of the Courier is about to open, at a time when
the prospects for world co-operation and especially for intellectual and cultural co-operation
are steadily improving, when there is a growing determination everywhere to break down
barriers of exclusion and distrust, to increase contacts and exchanges on the basis of a
common respect for fundamental human rights. The Unesco Courier is responding to
this challenge by adopting a new editorial formula which will enable its contributors
to express their differing viewpoints and its readers to appreciate each month the
diversity of the world.
It hardly needs to be said that these innovations, which will be described in detail
in the next issue, will follow the guidelines which have for so long earned the Courier
the loyalty of hundreds of thousands of readers worldwide. At the same time it is hoped
that expanded coverage and wider perspectives will attract hundreds of thousands more.
Tomorrow, as in the past, the Unesco Courier will seek above all to create, in homes
and schools, universities and offices, arts and leisure centres, a bond of solidarity which
transcends frontiers and combats prejudice, in order to build the defences of peace in
the minds of men, through education, science and culture.

Intercontinental travel by rail, sea and air is today
readily available to anyone with the means to pay for it.
Accurate detailed maps, charts and guidebooks help
travellers choose their route, decide where to stop off, tell
them what kind of weather to expect and describe every
place they could possibly wish to visit.
It is not easy nowadays to imagine what a
fragmentary and fantastic picture of the world our
ancestors once had. A glance at the maps produced as
late as the fourteenth century in Europe, Asia or the
Arab world is enough to show the incompleteness of
geographical knowledge and the extent of the mystery
which then veiled the contours of the Earth.
A radical change in outlook took place in the
fifteenth century when Portuguese navigators began to
explore the coasts ofAfrica; when Bartolomeu Dias
rounded the southern extremity of the continent in 1487;
and when Vasco da Gama opened up the sea route from
Europe to the East in 1498. These men, who crossed
with astonishment "seas no man had ever sailed before",
were plunged into a host of unexpected encounters
between the languages, values and customs ofpeoples
meeting for the first time.
The present issue seeks to give a glimpse of this key
period when human history assumed global dimensions.
An intellectual, aesthetic and technological revolution
had prepared the ground for a process which led
eventually to a truly global perception of the world.
Centuries later the enterprise of discovery would justly
be described by the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa as a
"civilization-creating act ".
We have not attempted to tell the full story of this
complex act of creation. We have chosen instead to
describe some major events and those who played an
important role in them, including the Portuguese poet
who splendidly immortalized the voyages of discovery in
his epic poem The Lusiads, Luis de Camôes.
Without glossing over the difficulties,
misunderstandings and conflicts which marked this great
human adventure, we have sought above all to define its
essential contribution to history: the irreversible
discovery of human diversity.

<![CDATA[
BY LUIS FILIPE BARRETO
AT the end of the fourteenth cen¬
tury, the extent of the known
world was, at most, equivalent to
barely one quarter of its true area. Islam¬
ic civilization was the repository of this
knowledge. When, during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, gaps in geo¬
graphical knowledge were gradually
filled, it was on the initiative of Christian
Europe.
As a result of the great maritime ex¬
peditions of this period Portugal became
largely responsible for bringing Europe
closer to Africa, Asia, the Americas and
Oceania. The significance of the Portuguese
discoveries in the history of civilizations is
that they made an extraordinary contribu¬
tion to the opening up of the planet. As
a result of Portuguese endeavours, Euro¬
peans sailed round the Capes of Tarfaya
and Bojador, the traditional limits of navi¬
gation along the west coast of Africa,
which had only seldom been passed.
They went on to reach equatorial regions
and the southern hemisphere and gave the
lie to the traditional European idea that
these regions were uninhabitable. These
discoveries established for the first time
that there was a link between the Atlan¬
tic and Indian Oceansthe so-called
"route to India"thus refuting the
widely-held traditional view that the
Indian Ocean was landlocked.
A new world-picture
As a result of this revolution in com¬
munication and knowledge, a relatively
accurate picture of the planet began to
emerge for the first time. The tropics and
the southern hemisphere were not inferi¬
or to the northern hemisphere but differ¬
ent, possessing a wider variety of
minerals, and plant and animal life. The

sentinel at the mouth of the Tagus since the
early 16th century, when it was built to

here sailed ships bound for India, the
Americas, Africa, China and Japan.
revolution also made a decisive contribu¬
tion, in both theory and practice, to the
discovery that humankind, one and the
same, existed all over the world.
The new awareness of life on a plan¬
etary scale, which came into being with
the discoveries of the fifteenth and six¬
teenth centuries, began to stimulate a
world economy based on the unequal
terms of trade which the Europeans im¬
posed in their dealings with other socie¬
ties. A mercantile economy centred on
cities such as Lisbon and Seville came into
being, with central and northern Europe
and the Italian cities providing the main
outlets and sources of finance.
The first signs of a world culture also
began to emerge. Books, letters, reports
and maps were published and circulated
in southern Europe but also in Goa,
Macao and Nagasaki. The Portuguese dis¬
coveries thus made a fundamental contri¬
bution to the transition from an age of
tightly-knit societies to a wider, more
open world.
Portuguese navigators settled in
Madeira and the Azores in the 1420s and
1430s and then advanced through the At¬
lantic and along the west coast of Africa.
Gil Eanes rounded Cape Bojador in 1434.
Between 1440 and 1460 further progress
was made along the coast of Guinea and
the Cape Verde islands were discovered.
The islands of Fernando Po, Sao Tomé,
Príncipe and Annobón were discovered
in 1470. In 1483, Diogo Cào reached the
River Congo and then, in 1487-1488,
Bartolomeu Dias established the existence
of a link between the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans by sailing round the Cape of
Good Hope, which he called the Cape of
Storms. Vasco da Gama's great voyage of
1497-1499 opened the sea route between
Europe and Asia.
In the sixteenth century, the drive for
expansion took the Portuguese into the
interior of Africa, with the exploration
of the Monomotapa empire (present-day
Zimbabwe) in 1514, and to the Americas,
with the arrival in 1500 of Pedro Alvares
Cabrai in Brazil and of the Corto Real
brothers in Newfoundland. Joäo Rod¬
rigues Cabrilho played a decisive role in
the exploration of Florida in 1539 and of
California in 1542-1543. The Portuguese
also went on to Asia and Oceania, reach¬
ing Malacca and the East Indies in
1509-1511, China in 1513 and Japan in
1542-1543.
Other European peoples spread out
into the wider world later than the Por¬
tuguese, who can be said to have ushered

new data collected by European navigators with the time-honoured canons of Ptolemaic
geography. The regions of the East and Far East seem to be joined to the lands discovered in the
West by Portuguese and Spanish explorers.

in a new era of knowledge and human
history in the 1420s and 1430s. The first
significant date in Spanish expansion was
1492, when Christopher Columbus
(1451-1506), who had been enlisted in the
service of the Catholic monarchs Ferdi¬
nand and Isabella, reached the West
Indies. French and British expansion only
began in the 1530s. Portugal's geograph¬
ic discoveries were not only ahead of
those of other European countries, but
the Portuguese were also the first to reach
all the continents (Africa, Asia, the
Americas and Oceania) and the major
oceans (the Atlantic, the Indian and the
Pacific).
As a result of this vast enterprise, Por¬
tugal became the repository of a data
bank on a planetary scale. For the first
time, a worldwide system of material and
intellectual exchanges took shape. Never
before had such a mass of information in
so many fieldsfrom the determination
of latitudes, watersheds, and magnetic
declinations to botany, zoology,
mineralogybeen compiled and classi¬
fied. The first attempts were also made
towards the systematic application of in¬
formation gathered from different oceans,
continents and societies.
An age of expansion
There were two main stages in the
Portuguese discoveries, separated by a
period of recession between 1460 and
1469, as a result of the death of Prince
Henry the Navigator and of hesitations
in the geostrategical policy of King
Afonso V (1438-1481).
The first stage began in 1415, with the
conquest of Ceuta in Morocco, and end¬
ed in 1460 with the arrival of the Por¬
tuguese in Sierra Leone. This period
corresponded to the emergence of a so¬
cial, technical and ideological structure
geared to the expansion of Portuguese
power in the Atlantic and Africa. The
thrust of this expansion was directed
towards three main objectives: settlement
in North Africa, a determination to sail
further south than Cape Bojador, and the

organization of an area of production in
Madeira and the Azores.
The first stage was dominated by
Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460),
a great figure who strove to coordinate
the activities of the nobles and merchants,
who coveted wealth from agriculture and
trade and aspired to control the trade
routes, and to reconcile these activities
with the imperatives of nationhood and
Christian Europe (as dictated by the
Papacy and the Order of Christ, a reli-
Joäo de Castro (1500-1548), a Portuguese
scholar and explorer who served for a time as
viceroy to India, made a major contribution
to the science of navigation with his

gious order of which Henry was made
grand master in 1420).
The second stage lasted from 1469,
when King Afonso V made a contract
with Fernào Gomes for the exploration
of the African seaboard, to 1498, when
Vasco da Gama arrived in Calicut (in the
present-day Indian state of Kerala), and
opened the way for the establishment of
a maritime link between Europe and
Asia. King Joäo II (1455-1495) was the
main figure behind the organization of
this move to conquer the south Atlantic
and to link the Atlantic and Indian
Oceans. As a result of his policies, Por¬
tuguese expansion was largely state-
controlled and mercantile. The spheres of
influence of the Portuguese crown under
its new policy were laid down in the
Treaty of Tordesillas concluded with
Spain in 1494, which defined the limits
to the area of Spanish and Portuguese
conquest in the Americas. However, the
prime goal of Portuguese policy was the
Orient, as witnessed by the overland jour¬
neys of Pêro da Covilhä, with the empha¬
sis being placed on navigational
technology and science.
Strategic locations
All through the sixteenth century, the
Portuguese strove to develop communi¬
cations within their Estado da India
("State of India") and to create a new so¬
ciety in Brazil. The "State of India" con-

sisted of a vast network of relations
between different civilizations stretching
from the Cape of Good Hope to Japan.
It was a system in which Portuguese
seafarers, explorers and merchants were
at their most mobile, ranging far and wide
from East Africa to the Orient in an in¬
tensive effort of dissemination and change
based on a minimum of linguistic, reli¬
gious and political unity. The "State of
India" was organized on the basis of a
small number of territorial possessions
covering the widest possible geographi¬
cal range. Portugal's maritime trading net¬
work drew its inspiration from the
example set by Islamic "thalassocracy"
(mastery of the seas).
In order to hold sway over the largest
possible area with a small number of ter¬
ritorial possessions, it was necessary to en¬
sure control over the high seas from a
number of strategic locations, such as
Hormuz, Goa and Malacca, and it was
this plan that Afonso de Albuquerque put
into effect between 1509 and 1515. In the
meantime, from 1502 onwards, this mar¬
itime hegemony, which was instrumen¬
tal in securing partial control of the seas
and the circulation of goods, became a
reality, as the Portuguese came to impose
the cartaze or safe-conduct system on
navigation by non-Christian vessels in the
Indian Ocean.
The basic features of the "State of
India" were its maritime activity, its mer¬
cantile economy and its urban demo¬
graphic structure. The key social unit was
the individual committed to the state and
the Church and spurred on by personal
initiative. The economic basis of the
"State of India's" prosperity was mercan¬
tile, its end-purpose being to foster trade
both between different regions of Asia
and between Asia and Europe. The main
commodities involved in this internation¬
al traffic were pepper and ginger from
Malabar and from Indonesia and Malay¬
sia; mace and nutmeg from the Banda Is¬
lands in the East Indies; cinnamon from
Ceylon; cloves from Ternate; horses from
Persia and Arabia; gold, silk and porcelain
from China; and gold from south-eastern
Africa (the Monomotapa empire) and
Sumatra.
The social system of Brazil, unlike
that of the "State of India", was based on
the landowning colonial families. Society
was based on the aristocratic and slave-
owning model and wealth took the form
of agricultural holdings and slave labour,
with stockraising and the monoculture of
sugarcane.
The Portuguese of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries thus practised on a
large scale the intermingling of cultures
and peoples. They established links be¬
tween the Christian, Jewish and Islamic
civilizations, purveyed commodities and
syncretized religions and customs.
At the time of the great discoveries,
the Portuguese language came to be the
main vernacular of maritime and mercan¬
tile communication, especially along the
coasts of Africa and the Orient. The fact
that Portuguese today has more words of
Asian, African and Amerindian origin
than any other European language is one
result of this far-reaching dialogue be¬
tween civilizations.
LUIS FILIPE BARRETO, Portuguese historian of
Angolan origin, is professor of history at the Clas¬
sical University of Lisbon and author of a number
of works on the Portuguese discoveries, including
a tri-lingual (Portuguese/French/English) publica¬
tion entitled Portugal: A Pioneer ofthe North/South
Dialogue (Imprensa Nacional, Lisbon, 1988).

Prince Henry the Navigator
and King Joâo II
Prince Henry (1394-1460), son of
King Joäo I, ¡s known as "the
Navigator" because he inspired,
financed and organized the early
Portuguese voyages of discovery. He
epitomized Portugal's drive for
religious, political and economic
expansion, which was given further
impetus in the second half of the
15th century by his great-nephew
King Joâo II (1455-1495), who
continued exploration of the African
coast and the quest for the route to
India. Above, detail of a panel from
the polyptych for Säo Vicente, by
Nuno Gonçalves, shows Henry with
the future Joäo II at his side. (See also

household, to explore the west coast"
of Africa. The first European to set
foot on African soil south of the
Equator, he established friendly
relations with local rulers in the Congo,
Angola and Namibia. During his first
voyage, in 1482, he explored the coast
between Cape Catarina and Cape
Lopez (in present-day Gabon). On a
second voyage he passed Pointe-Noire
and sailed upriver to explore the
interior of the Congo and Angola.
Like other Portuguese navigators, he
set up engraved stone pillars (padröes)
in the places he visited, as a result of
which it has been possible to retrace
his steps. The padrao shown here is in
the possession of the Lisbon
Geographical Society.
Bartolomeu Dias
Aknight of the royal household,
Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500), is
famed for the voyage (1487-1488) in
which he rounded the southernmost
point of Africa, the Cape of Good
Hope, which he named the Cape of
Storms. He thus confirmed King Joäo
ll's hypothesis that it was possible to
reach India by sea. Ten years later a
fleet commanded by Vasco da Gama
set sail from the Tagus estuary in
search of the legendary eastern land
of spices and gold. Dias carried out
further expeditions and died when his
ship went down not far from the
cape he had discovered. The map,
below, was produced by the German
cartographer Henricus Martellus
around 1489 and shows the
immediate impact of Dias' voyage on
European cartography.

Vasco da Gama
Vasco da Gama (c. 1468-1524), the
most celebrated of the Portuguese
navigators, carried out several missions
for King Joäo II before being
appointed admiral of the fleet which
sailed around the Cape of Good Hope
and opened the sea route from
Western Europe to India in 1498, a
major achievement for the Portuguese.
(Six years before, Christopher
Columbus, sailing under the Spanish
flag, had tried to find a western sea
route to Asia, but instead reached
America, the existence of which had
not been suspected by Europeans.) Da
Gama's fleet sailed from Lisbon on
8 July 1497 and arrived at Calicut, on
the south-west coast of India, in May
the following year. He met the
Zamorin (ruler) of Calicut and gave him
a letter from King Joäo's successor,
Manuel I, proposing an alliance and a
commercial treaty. After his return to
Lisbon, Da Gama was made
Portuguese viceroy to India. His great
voyage of discovery inspired Luís de
Camôes' epic poem The Lusiads.
Fernäo de Magalhäes
(Ferdinand Magellan)
Magellan (c. 1480-1521)
commanded the first expedition
to sail round the world (1519-1522).
While ¡n the East as a soldier in the
service of the Portuguese crown, he
learned much that proved useful
during his great voyage. At that time
many Portuguese navigators were
offered large sums by foreign rulers to
command maritime expeditions, and
Magellan entered the service of the
Emperor Charles V, who was also
King of Spain. The major commercial
rivals of the Portuguese, the Spaniards
were seeking a western sea route
which would take them around the
Americas to Asia. Magellan's proposal
to sail westwards to the Spice Islands
or the Moluccas received royal assent.
On 21 October 1520 his ships
rounded the southern tip of South
America via what would later be
known as the Strait of Magellan and
entered the ocean which he called the
"Pacific". The great navigator did not
live to see the conclusion of his
project. He was killed in a skirmish in
the Philippines and the voyage was
completed by the Spaniard
Juan Sebastián Elcano. This portrait of
Magellan is in the Naval Museum,
Madrid.
Pedro Alvares Cabrai
After Vasco da Gama's discovery
of the sea route to India, Pedro
Alvares Cabrai (c. 1467-1520) was
appointed captain of the second
Portuguese fleet bound for Calicut. His
orders were to establish commercial
and political relations with the port,
which was then the centre of the
spice trade. The fleet, which left
Lisbon harbour in 1 500, drifted off
course and headed west,- finally
reaching the Brazilian coast at a point
which Cabrai named Vera Cruz. In
spite of the belief that Brazil was
discovered by chance, there are
several indications that King Manuel I
of Portugal had ordered Cabrai to find
a route to the "West Indies", as the
Americas were known. Both the
Portuguese and the Spanish were
exploring these regions, and the
two nations had drawn up the Treaty
of Tordesillas in 1494 in order to
define the limits of their respective
spheres of influence in the New
World. Above, statue of Cabrai in a

.
THE scientific and technical de¬
velopments which took place in
sixteenth-century Portugal had
their roots in the Atlantic navigation of
the previous century or, to be more pre¬
cise, in the conditions created by ocean
navigation and the new possibilities it
opened up.
Around the middle of the fifteenth
century, navigators began to study sea
currents and wind directions as a first step
towards understanding the geography of
the great oceans. Improvements were also
made in shipbuilding techniques, and in
the accuracy of navigational instruments.
The art of cartography developed in Por¬
tugal during the early years of the centu¬
ry, initially inspired by Mediterranean
(Italian and Majorcan) models, but even¬
tually acquiring an originality of its own
and gaining acceptance in other countries,
especially France and Japan. Ptolemy's
geographical theories, which enjoyed a
revival of popularity from the second
decade of the century, were soon being
revised in the light of new information.
Sailing the high seas
The study of currents and winds and
their variations began when Portuguese
merchant and exploratory ships ventured
ever further south along the west coast
of Africa. The outward voyage was not
particularly difficult, but the winds and
currents encountered on the return jour¬
ney frequently slowed down the ships or
brought them to a complete halt. The ef¬
forts made to overcome these obstacles
had three important consequences. Initial¬
ly, a technique was evolved for dealing
with a head or beam wind by going about
or tacking, then a lighter vessel better
suited to this type of navigation was
designedthe caravel. Eventually, return¬
ing sailors realized that they would reach
their destination more quickly by head¬
ing out into the open sea to avoid the
problem zones. This manoeuvre, which
no doubt accounted for the frequent stops
in the Azores, is referred to by modern
historians as "the return by the open sea",
whereas in the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬
turies it was called the "Guinea return"
or the "Mina return". (On the way back
from Sao Jorge de Mina, the Portuguese
trading-post on the Gold Coast, now
Ghana, ships would change course and
head northwest until they reached the
approximate latitude of Lisbon.)
These navigational tactics, which ob¬
liged ships for the first time to take to the
open sea, were bound to confront pilots
with unexpected problems. Even when
Mediterranean ships sailed beyond the
Strait of Gibraltar to the Channel or
North Sea ports, they hugged the coast¬
line and could check their position vir¬
tually every day by reference to a point
on land. On the other hand, the return
voyage by the high seas from Guinea, and
later from the Gold Coast, to Lagos (in
Portugal) or Lisbon, involved sailing
"blind" for anything from three weeks
to two months. The best moment to
change course and head eastwards
towards the Portuguese coast could be in¬
dicated by the winds, the currents, the
colour of the water, or the sea-birds, but
this kind of "natural" indication could
be extremely unreliable. A means had,
therefore, to be found to check the ship's
position every day in the absence of any
landmark.
Meridians and magnetism
At first pilots calculated the meridian
altitudes of the stars (the Pole Star and
certain others, and also the sun). Then,
at some point in the ocean, with the aid
of sextant or astrolabe (later replaced by
the quadrant), they compared these celes¬
tial observations with the altitudes of the
same stars at their meridian transit above
Lisbon or some other fixed point of
reference.
Initially this procedure was nothing
more than an adaptation of a method
which John of Hollywood had recom¬
mended in his thirteenth-century treatise
Sphaera tnundi, for measuring the length
of one degree of a meridian.

almost daily on board ship. However,
early-sixteenth-century navigators still
lacked a means of determining longitude,
which would have made it possible to fix
the ship's exact position. If some of them
came up with the wrong solutions in
their experiments, others would point
out their errors, thus enabling different
problems to be solved.
Even erroneous calculations were put
to immediate use. Convinced that longi¬
tude was in direct linear relation to the
Earth's magnetic declination, the Por¬
tuguese navigators of the sixteenth cen¬
tury noted all the values of this
declination (which they would later use
as "sightings" or indicators of their posi¬
tion). These accumulated data would
prove useful to the English pioneer
researcher, into magnetism, William
Gilbert, and the Flemish mathematician
Simon Stevin, when, towards the end of
the century, they were studying
phenomena connected with the Earth's
magnetism, theories regarding which
were still at a rudimentary stage.
Portolan charts
The art of navigation had made rapid
strides in the second half of the fifteenth
century. Pilots had quickly learned to de¬
termine latitude from the altitude of stars,
or from that of the sun using daily decli¬
nation tables (showing the distance of the
sun's zenith north or south of the Equa¬
tor on any given day). Apart from these
basic data, they possessed readings of the
number of leagues covered by different
wind-zones (from one compass point to
another) and by one degree of latitude,
as well as timetables of tides at various
points along the coast. The earlier naviga¬
tional techniques, improved and adapted
to the new methods, were also still in use.
All this information was recorded in
the navigation manuals and charts known
as portolans. The first two of these
anonymous guides were published at Lis¬
bon in 1509 and 1516, with some differ¬
ences between the two editions. Based on
sailing experience, they contained the
data already mentioned, together with the
latitudes of the places most frequented by
navigators and an occasionally inaccurate
translation ofJohn of Hollywood's trea¬
tise, in which pilots learned the rudiments
of cosmography.
One of the oldest maps depicting Portuguese
voyages of discovery. It was produced in
1485 by the Portuguese cartographer Pedro
Reinel and shows for the first time the
African coastline as far as the point reached
by Diogo Cäo.
Despite some inconsistencies, these in¬
novative works, the oldest of their kind,
gained widespread acceptance and were
wholly or partially imitated until the six¬
teenth century. Some extracts from them
were even translated into French, En¬
glish, Italian and German.
Caravels, carracks and galleons
Fifteenth- and sixteenth-century navi¬
gation had an equally strong impact on
shipbuilding. When the first forays took
place beyond Cape Bojador, there was as
yet no typical vessel, as different designs
were being experimented with. But once
voyages of coastal reconnaissance, or the
exploration of river estuaries, became
more frequent, the caravel (or rather
caravels, as there was never a standard
model) became the type of vessel
preferred by explorers, because it was fast
and lightqualities which shipwrights
were determined to maximize.
Caravels still formed part of the first
fleets to reach India in the early sixteenth
century, but they were gradually replaced
by the larger, heavier carracks and
galleons which could transport more car¬
go. However, caravels continued to be
built in the Portuguese shipyards, not
only for the reconnaissance missions be¬
gun in the Atlantic in the fifteenth cen¬
tury, but also, owing to their lightness,
to provide fast connections between the
forts scattered along the route to India.
Around this time also, ships began to be
equipped with a superstructure which
enabled cannon to be mounted in them.
The oldest treatises on shipbuilding
that have come down to us, by Fernan¬
do Oliveira, Joâo Baptista Lavanha and
Manuel Fernandes, are documents of in¬
estimable value for the history of naval
architecture.
Progress in cartography
Two significant events sum up the
contribution that the transoceanic
voyages made to scientific geography.
Firstly, about a year after Bartolomeu
Dias completed the voyage which virtu¬
ally proved that the Atlantic and Indian
oceans were connected, the German car¬
tographer Henricus Martellus drew a map
of the African coast as far as the Rio
Infante (not far from the Cape of Good
Hope, which Dias had named the Cape
of Storms), based upon the data collect¬
ed by Dias and his predecessors. For the
areas beyondthe Gulf, the Red Sea and
Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka)
Germanus relied on the Ptolemaic model.
Equally important was the publication
in the fifteenth century of a Latin trans¬
lation of Ptolemy's Guide to Geography,
which had been forgotten throughout
most of the Middle Ages. Reprinted in
1475, the Geography reached its seventh

edition in 1490. It reappeared in 1507, and
the eleventh edition, published in Stras¬
bourg in 1513, included new maps, the
tabulae novae, which showed the config¬
uration of all the lands and inhabited
islands which had been recorded by navi¬
gators up to that time.
A planisphere included in the Stras¬
bourg edition is modelled on the anony¬
mous Portuguese map of the world, the
so-called Cantino map (after Alberto
Camino, the Italian who purchased it in
Lisbon). Although not dated, it was prob¬
ably made in the early autumn of 1502.
The Equator and the two Tropics are
represented for the first time on this map
(see centre colour pages). Later, on a map
of the Atlantic which has been dated at
1504, Pedro Reinel incorporated a scale
of latitudesthe first in the history of car¬
tography.
Portuguese sixteenth-century cartog¬
raphy won wide recognition, not because
of its revolutionary nature, but because
it showed with some degree of accuracy
many parts of the world which were
previously unknown, or little known, in
Europe. Portuguese cartographers were
also to be found at this period in Spain
(Jorge Reinel and Diogo Ribeiro), France
(Lopo Hörnern and Bartolomeu Velho)
and England (Diogo Hörnern), where
their work was generally very well paid.
Dutch engraved cartography of the late
sixteenth century also made occasional
use of the services of Portuguese car¬
tographers such as Luis Teixeira, found¬
er of a dynasty of map-makers which
flourished until the end of the seven¬
teenth century.
The discoveries recorded in guide¬
books and travelogues
The achievements of the Portuguese
voyages of exploration were to culminate
in the discovery of Brazil, the opening of
a complex network of maritime routes in
the Indian Ocean, the occupation of
Malacca and the penetration of the
western Pacific, followed by the Por¬
tuguese arrival in China and the Moluc¬
ca Islands and finally in Japan. Many
men, driven by the pursuit of wealth and
profit, no doubt, but also curious and
observant, travelled through previously
unknown lands and cities, cast anchor in
faraway ports, mixed with peoples who
differed from them in language and cus¬
toms, and discovered many kinds of fau¬
na and flora. All these discoveries were
passed on in works that are remarkable
for the accuracy of their information and
the understanding and respect they show
for people's myths and beliefs.
Around 1513, for example, A Suma
Oriental by Tomé Pires, an apothecary
who died in China, provided not only bo¬
tanical observations but a veritable com¬
mercial guide to the Orient. Duarte
Barbosa produced a similar work in 1518,
and Francisco Alvares wrote a mono¬
graph on Abyssinia which was published
in 1540. In 1587, Gabriel Soâres de Sousa
completed a wide-ranging treatise on the
Indians of the Brazilian coast, the scien¬
tific rigour of which would do credit to
a modern ethnologist. Father Gaspar da
Cruz wrote about China and Hormuz,
an anonymous author left a description
of the Moluccas, and Garcia da Orta and
Cristóvao da Costa produced excellent
studies of the medicinal plants of the East.
If we add to this list, which is far from
exhaustive, the texts on the art of navi¬
gation which were written in the same
period, if we think of the role played by
the portolans, travelogues and, especial¬
ly, the innumerable marine charts, and if
we point out that some of these works,
in translation, found their way into the
priceless collections of the Italian
geographer Giovanbattista Ramusio and
of other scholars, we gain at least some
idea of how a small country, with a
population of less than two million,
participated in the birth of the modern
era and in the irresistible European
expansion that was destined to last for
four centuries. The Portuguese and their
cultural and geographical neighbours thus
contributed to the construction of the
world in which we live.

JAPAN IN EARLY
PORTUGUESE MAPS BY ALFREDO PINHEIRO MARQUES
m
This 16th-century Japanese screen showing the arrival of the Portuguese in the Land of the Rising Sun is a typical example of Japanese nanban
art in which European ships, figures and goods were depicted.
LATE medieval Europe possessed only sketchy knowledge
ofJapan, and such fantastic and muddled information as
existed was largely culled from a single source, The Book
ofMarco Polo. Although the Venetian traveller never reached
the Japanese archipelago, he wrote about a mythical land,
Cipango, which Christopher Columbus was hoping to find on
his first voyage in 1492.
The Portuguese were the first to discover the sea route to
India and the Far East, and sometime in the early 1540s a group
of adventurers which included the famous Fernào Mendes Pinto
(author of an exciting travelogue, Peregrinaçao) became the first
Westerners to set foot on Japanese soil. Their arrival marked
the start of an exemplary cultural exchange which was to last
for almost a hundred years, and which was a source of mutual
enrichment to Japanese and Portuguese alike.
Cartography was one field in which this encounter between
cultures found expression. The Portuguese were at that time
the European masters of navigation and of mapmaking tech¬
niques. As they became more familiar with the Japanese ar¬
chipelago, they included it on their charts and maps and

thus helped to make Japan known in
Europe, where these maps were much
sought after.
A Portuguese, Tomé Pires, was also
the first Western author to use the name
Japan ffampon) in a non-cartographical
work, A Suma Oriental (1512-1515). Ac¬
cording to Professor Armando Cortesâo,
the first accurate depiction of Japan in
European cartography after the coun¬
try had been visited by Westerners is
on an anonymous Portuguese map
(c. 1550) preserved in the Vallicelliana
Library in Italy. This is also the first
European map on which the name
Japan appears.
Japan had previously been depicted
conjecturally on a number of Europe¬
an maps, notably the Insularium illus-
tratum by the German cartographer
Henricus Martellus (c. 1490) and in the
work of a number of Portuguese car¬
tographers such as Francisco Rodrigues
(1515), Pedro Reinel (c. 1517) and Lopo
Homem-Reinéis (c. 1519), based on secondhand information
gathered in the Orient, in Malacca and in Indochina.
In the 1550s and 1560s, the Italian cartographers Paolo
Forlani and Giacomo Gastaldi drew maps which were based,
not on Marco Polo's reports but on information from the writ¬
ings of St. Francis Xavier, the Spanish missionary who preached
Christianity in Portugal's Asian possessions. But these maps
had no great following, unlike those of the Portuguese, which
were widely copied and became the model for the representa¬
tion of the Japanese archipelago in Western cartography. At
this time the influence of two Portuguese mapmakers, the
brothers Lopo and Diogo Hörnern, was widely felt. Between
1560 and 1580 another Portuguese, Bartolomeu Velho, produced
a series of maps in which the orientation and configuration of
the Japanese islands were depicted with increasing accuracy. In
1569 the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator combined
Gastaldi's map with the anonymous map of the 1550s. In 1570
Abraham Ortelius of Antwerp followed Bartolomeu Velho's
model when including Japan in his world atlas.
Meanwhile, another type of map of Japan was being
produced by Portuguese cartographers, showing the archipela¬
go in the form of four crescent moons with their extremities
turned towards the south. This model appears for the first time
in the anonymous Portuguese atlas which accompanies the
Livro de Marinharia (Book of Seamanship) de Joâo de Lisboa,
published around 1560. Although less accurate than Bartolomeu
Velho's map, this model came to predominate and was widely
accepted in Europe, where it was diffused by Fernab Vaz
Dourado (a Portuguese cartographer born in Goa of an Indian
mother) in the many atlases he produced between 1560 and
1570, and thus is often known as the "Vaz Dourado type".
Towards the end of the sixteenth century, more accurate maps
were being produced by the Portuguese cartographer Luis Teixeira,
and these were further refined by his son, Joäo Teixeira Albernaz,
during the first half of the seventeenth century.
The Portuguese were responsible for making known the im¬
age of Japan in Europe, but this was not a one-way process. On
the contrary, it is thought that Japanese maps were used as sources
by the Portuguese, especially in the earliest period and notably in
the work of Lopo Hörnern, in which the influence of Japanese

maps of the "Gyogi" type can clearly
be seen.
Moreover, as Professor Kazutaka
Unno of the University of Osaka has
shown, the development of modern
Japanese terrestrial and marine cartog¬
raphy was based on Portuguese naviga¬
tional maps rather than on those of the
Dutch, as had formerly been thought.
This influence became apparent in the
sixteenth century and continued to
bear fruit for 200 years, even after Por¬
tuguese relations with Japan had come
to an end.
This mutual influence in cartogra¬
phy is surely one of the most interest¬
ing aspects of the cultural exchange
between two nations, so different and
yet so close, which set an example of peaceful and fruitful
dialogue between civilizations of Orient and Occident in the
sixteenth century.

BY VASCO GRAÇA MOURALUIS DE CAMOES
The eventful life and times of Portugal's great epic poet
Possibly the most faithful of the few surviving portraits of Camôes is this copy of a work, now
lost, by his contemporary Fernäo Gomes.
THE little that is known about the
life of Luis de Camôes can be
summed up in a few lines. He was
probably born in Lisbon in 1525, but
even this is not known for certain. Noth¬
ing is known about what he studied or
where (possibly in Coimbra) and next to
nothing about his life until he set sail for
the Orient, where he spent seventeen
equally obscure years. A few biographi¬
cal hints can be gleaned from his writings.
It seems, for example, that he had a rather
hectic love-life, and it was perhaps be¬
cause of his way of life that he was
banished from the court as a young man.
He is known to have served as a soldier
in Ceuta, Morocco, around 1547-1548
and to have lost his right eye there.
In 1552, he spent several months in
prison in Lisbon for taking part in a
brawl and after his release in the spring
of 1553 embarked for India on three
years' service, as was the rule at the time.
While in India, he took part in a number
of military expeditions. Sometime be¬
tween 1556 and 1558, he set out for the
Far East, perhaps as a junior official
responsible for taking care of the effects
of people who died on the voyage. It is
not known with certainty whether it was
on the outward or return voyage that he
was shipwrecked in the Mekong estuary,
swimming ashore carrying nothing but
his manuscript.
When he returned to Goa, he was
again thrown into prison. After his
release he lived on the island of Mozam¬
bique between 1567 and 1569, returning
to Portugal in 1570 in a state of dire
poverty. By then, however, the text of
his epic poem was virtually ready for
publication.
He published Os Lustadas (The Lusiads)
in Lisbon in 1572, and then two short
poems in 1576. In 1572, the king granted
him a small pension, but Camôes later
had to submit a claim for arrears of
payment.
Nothing more is known about his life
in Portugal after 1570. He appears to have
been the butt of epigrams composed by
authors who were in favour at court,
which may suggest tha.. he was envied
either on account of the stature of his
work or because of his pension. He may
then have gone through a mystical,
"penitential" phase if, as is supposed,
his magnificent verse commentary on
Psalm 137 ("By the waters of Babylon")
was written after The Lusiads. In 1574,
a short but enthusiastic critique of his
work was published, in which the author,
Pero de Magalhäes Gândavo, wrote:
"Look at the work of our celebrated poet
Luis de Camôes, whose fame will outlast
time.
We know neither the precise date of
his death (sometime between 1579 and
1580) nor the location of his tomb in the
Santa Ana church, which was destroyed
in the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Not a
single manuscript in his own hand has
survived, and even the portraits of him
are disputed.
In the sixteenth century, The Lusiads
was twice translated into Spanish, and
there appeared a collection of his unpub¬
lished writings, editions of his lyric
poetry (1595 and 1598) and two more edi¬
tions of The Lusiads, one (severely muti¬
lated) in 1584 and the other in 1597.
From then on a strong and still continu¬
ing interest began to be taken in Camôes'
life and work and attempts began to be
made to decipher the mysteries in which
they were veiled.
Camôes lived during the last phase of
Portuguese expansion, at a time when his
country was on the verge of decline and

political collapse. His death one or two
years after the defeat of Alcazarquivir
(1578) more or less coincided with Por¬
tugal's loss of independence to Spain, a
situation which was to last until 1640.
Yet, at the same time, Camôes lived
through a period of intellectual activity
which has a remarkable place in the so¬
cial, cultural, economic and political his¬
tory of Portugal, Europe, and the world.
The values enshrined in the classical
humanism of the Renaissance, which be¬
gan to spread through Europe from Italy
at the end of the fifteenth century, came
to be blended with echoes from the teach¬
ings of the Dutch humanist Erasmus and
with the multifarious debates and con¬
flicts sparked off by the Reformation and
by the growing theoretical and practical
consolidation of centralized power. The
geographical discoveries brought in their
wake a mass of new information about
the extent and true appearance of the
world. They led to encounters with many
other peoples, and brought into contact
a profusion of different cultures and civili¬
zations. Much-coveted produce and new
sources of wealth arrived daily in the
ports of Europe. The secrets of the planet
were gradually being discovered. The cir¬
culation of printed information was in¬
creasing.
These upheavals brought with them
a growing sense of unease which was
reflected in the arts by a transition from
classicism to mannerism, in politics by in¬
creasingly authoritarian forms of govern¬
ment, and in civil and intellectual life by
censorship, the repression exercised by
the Inquisition, the concealment of un¬
orthodox thinking, and fear. But they
also led to rapid changes in customs, at¬
titudes and social structures, greed, the
discovery of new ways of making easy
money, changes in patterns of consump¬
tion, and the depopulation of inland areas
due to the attraction exercised by com¬
mercial life in the capital and overseas.
Science in turn began to concern it¬
self with the quantifiable aspects of the
world and with the criticism of empiri-
The voyages of discovery opened up
new and often contradictory ways of
thinking, and new and sometimes
startling horizons beckoned to those with
a taste for adventure and enterprise, will¬
power and daring, speculation and
wealth, travel and danger, freedom of ac¬
tion and fatalism. The times incited men
to live dramatic lives in an age in which
the most clear-sighted of them saw the
Portuguese venture as a form of Euro¬
pean expansion whose common denomi¬
nator was the propagation of the
Christian faith, even though, like
Camôes, they criticized the divisions
among the Christians and claimed for
Portugal the role of prime agent of
Catholicism outside Europe. Camôes was
undeniably the poet of a system of values
proper to the European culture and civili¬
zation of his age.
The dominant ideology took full
measure of the universal impact of the
Portuguese discoveries, compared them
and found them superior to the legendary
exploits of the heroes of classical Anti¬
quity, and wished to hear them celebrat¬
ed in the classical form of the epic poem.

the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, four
years before that of Columbus, revolu¬
tionized geographical concepts and
marked the threshold of a new era. Ten
years later, the voyage of Vasco da Gama
made an even more radical contribution
to the transformation of European civili¬
zation and world history. In the ensuing
decades there were many other Por¬
tuguese voyages of major importance. But
there was no creative work of art to extol
the feats responsible for these sweeping
changes.
A poet of his time
It was against this background that
Camôes lived and wrote his epic and lyri¬
cal work, in which so many contradicto¬
ry elements coexist: tradition and
innovation; Platonism and Aristotelian-
ism; erudition and raw experience;
mythology and Christianity; piety and
cruelty; feudal nostalgia and the concept
of the modern state; a sense of order and
disorder; joy and anguish; the Renaissance
and Mannerism. In Camôes, there is a
tension between the concept of man as
a "mean creature of clay" and the gran¬
deur of his accomplishments on a global
scale, between the frail microcosm who
can overcome obstacles when aided by
heaven or by valour and daring, and all
the harm that can befall him if he be¬
comes the mere plaything of the occult
forces of Nature, fortune or destiny.
At sea by such rough storms and griefs
forespent!
So many a moment when Death stands
alert!
Ashore such strife and treacherous intent,
Where horrible necessity can hurt!
How can weak man escape the harsh event,
And how misfortunefrom brieflife avert,
Where calm Skies range not nor take arms
alway
Against so mean a creature of the clay?
The Lusiads,* I, 106
However, a similar tension also exists
between Camôes' national pride and his
harsh and biting criticism of the very hu¬
man reality whose praises he is singing:
Alas! my Muse, alas! because my lyre
Is wholly out oftune and my voice hoarse,
Not from my song, but knowing I must
quire
Alwaysfor a people who are deafand coarse.
The favour which sets genius all on fire
My land grants not to song, but runs
perforce
After its envious lusts and brutishness,
Sunken in harsh, depraved, and gross
distress.
The Lusiads, X, 145
These antagonistic ideas are repeated
again and again throughout the complex
structure of a poem in which the symbol¬
ic linking of different levels of meaning
represents a striking and innovative feat

literary forms imported from Italy and
the renewal of the literary language, and
the historical events of his time, especial¬
ly the information accumulated about the
great ocean voyages.
Camôes made use of the epic form in
a new way, so that actual geographical
regions and mythical regions, real or con¬
temporary time and mythical or absolute
time, historical events and cosmic desti¬
ny, were all welded together and "con¬
taminated" one another. Even the hero,
who, in the grand tradition of the classi¬
cal epic, personifies an entire people, is
here not so much Vasco da Gama alone
as a host of figures represented by the
"illustrious Lusitanian breast, to which
Neptune and Mars bowed down in obe¬
dience". With those figures are connect¬
ed a series of events, facts, individual and
collective deeds indissociable from the
course of Portuguese history.
Camôes witnessed the world-shaking
events of his time with classical eyes in
both life and literature, blending the mag¬
ic of paganism with the tenets of the
Christian faith and indeedin a daring
and brilliant stroketransporting the
mainsprings of his plot to the plane of ac¬
tion of the pagan gods who symbolized
the forces of Nature, some favourable and
some hostile to the Portuguese venture.
At the same time, however, he wit¬
nessed the planetary revolution of his
time with a modern outlook that enabled
him to reject earlier models and to strike
a new balance between what his genius
could extract from them and what the age
required him to introduce and treat in an
original and concrete manner. His aim
was to set the literal truth of recent histor¬
ical events and exploits against the legen
dary character of the ancient epics and,
in so doing, to underscore the role which
the Portuguese had played in the discov¬
ery of the world ("... and if there are
other worlds, they will reach them ...").
He clearly saw the revolution of his
time in terms of the then geocentric view
of the structure of the universe, and this
enabled him to construct one of the most
moving episodes in the poem, that in

For human wit cannot so far extend.

An encyclopaedic work
	 24 	
Since Camôes was singing of real
things rather than of "vain and fantastic
exploits that are false and deceitful", he
attached the highest importance to histor¬
ical narratives and authentic eyewitness
accounts of voyages by Vasco da Gama
and other navigators, to details of navi¬
gation, technology, the calendar, wind
systems, climates, natural phenomena,
peoples and their customs, and to the ac¬
curacy of other aspects of Portuguese
history.
Thus, apart from its inestimable liter¬
ary and aesthetic merits, The Lusiads is a
kind of encyclopaedia or compendium of
much of the theoretical and practical
knowledge available in its author's life¬
time. It contains information on history
and geography, anthropology, technolo¬
gy and scienceranging from flora and
fauna to astronomyand especially on
the data gathered as a result of the ocean
voyages and discoveries. Even when he
refers to such natural phenomena as
waterspouts and St. Elmo's fire, it can be
assumed that he does so because they
were recorded by Joäo de Castro
(1500-1548), a Portuguese naval officer
who made important contributions to the
science of navigation.
Almost every time he describes peoples,
landscape, geography, the exotic features of
Africa or the Orient, or incidents during
Vasco da Gama's voyage, he bases his ac¬
count on a chronicle, travelogue or some
other document in an attempt to achieve
strict accuracy combined with the mytho¬
logical transpositions mentioned above.

Two Africans from the Cape of Good Hope. This illustration and those on pages 30 and 33 are

Africa and the Orient with whom the Portuguese came into contact during their voyages. The
manuscript is preserved in the Casanatense Library, Rome.
As the poet of the discoveries and of
the epic of modern man, Camôes did not
lose sight of the two main driving forces
behind maritime expansion. The first of
these was the propagation of the faith,
which was not to be construed exclusive¬
ly as a crusading ideal dictated by the
Ottoman threat to the eastern approaches
to Europe, but also as the starting-point
for the dissemination of a European cul¬
ture. The second was the organization of
trade on a worldwide scale for the benefit
of all peoples. Camôes was a European
poet in the temporal sense, in that he en¬
hanced, used and re-created a cultural
heritage many centuries old. In a spatial,
geo-political and economic sense, he was
also a European poet who singled out
Europe as a region with specific ties of
solidarity and interests.
This is why Camôes saw the voyage
of Vasco da Gama not only as an expedi¬
tion "to the greater glory of God" but
also as a commercial venture, at the out¬
come of which the navigator presented
the ruler of Calicut with proposals for en¬
gaging in peaceful trade to the mutual
benefit of the King of Portugal and
himself:
And ifthou wilt with treaty and with pact
Ofpeace and friendship, open and divine,
Trade out of superfluity enact
Between his country's merchandise and
thine,
Thus greater gain and plenty to attract
(For which in toil and sweat men chiefly
pine);
Unto thy realms, then there will surely be
For him great glory, and great wealth for
thee.
The Lusiads, VII, 62
This epitomizes the idea of trade be¬
tween distant peoples as a source of
wealth and abundance, of profit and
glory. Here again, Camôes' viewpoint is
highly topical, in that he extols the skills
and dignity of enrichment through trade
based on the principle of reciprocity
(while also seeking to impose moral con¬
straints on such trade). Vasco da Gama
showed determination and discipline in
executing the orders given by the king,
who became one of the world's leading
traders when the era of major trading net¬
works began.
Camôes lived a full life. For seventeen
years, he knew the fluctuating fortunes
of a voyage to India, went to war,
travelled to the Far East and experienced
exile, adversity, disgrace, suffering and
despair. In short, he paid a personal toll
for the great discoveries.
Traces of his experience can be found
in a number of main themes of The Lu¬
siads. Equally skilled with the sword and
the pen, he bitterly laments the oblivion
or injustice of which he is the victim. He
mentions the shipwreck he survived. He
refers to the crises of his love affairs,
which he personifies in the pathetic figure
of the giant Adamastor and in the perse¬
cution of the nymphs on the Island of
Love by the soldier Leonardo Ribeiro.
He asserts his awareness of his genius and
abilities and his readiness to continue
singing to the present and future glory of
his native land.
The entire corpus of Camôes' work,
with its hundreds of lyric poems, its let¬
ters and plays, highlights the contradic¬
tions inherent in a man who was torn
between nostalgia for a supreme harmo¬
ny and an acute sense of the absurdity and
confusion of the world, between an af¬
firmation of the values enshrined in hu¬
man liberty and a sense of outrage at
being nothing more than a puppet in the
hands of fate, and between the inescapa¬
ble and everlasting presence of unhappi-
ness and the all too fleeting moments of
life and human happiness. The ultimate
contrast is that between the evil of the
present and the good of the past, which
inspires some of the most poignant fea¬
tures of Camôes' work.

The Lusiads FROM NATIONAL EPIC
TO UNIVERSAL MYTH
"fe'**¿3Ea
£&*U
Imaginary portrait of Camôes is taken from a French edition of The Lusiads published in Paris in
1817 with illustrations by European artists.
THE Western maritime discoveries
of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen¬
turies, in which Portugal played
a leading role, were the culmination of
an odyssey which had begun in ancient
times. They extended the bounds of the
adventure embarked on long before by
the Phoenicians and the Greeks to all the
seas of the world. The cycle of modern
discoveries was symbolically closed in
1520 by Ferdinand Magellan, a Por¬
tuguese navigator who sailed for the King
of Spain. After him there began an era of
methodical, scientific exploration of what
the twentieth-century poet Fernando
Pessoa called the "endless sea", the mare
nostrum of the Romans enlarged to
global dimensions.
If this image exaggerates the real mar¬
itime area traversed by the navigators of
Portugal, Italy, Spain and other European
nations between the beginning of the
fifteenth century and Magellan's voyage,
it epitomizes the difference between the
voyages of the Ancients and those of the
modern era. In the first decade of the six¬
teenth century, Westerners acquired firm
evidence that the Earth is round, and
knew from "knowledge which owes
everything to experience"to quote a
BY EDUARDO LOURENÇO
line of The Lusiadsof a sea that extend¬
ed from Europe to Japan and from
Greenland to Tierra del Fuego.
This knowledge was acquired the hard
way, after more than a century of sporad¬
ic but methodical exploration whose
modest beginnings led to the reconnais¬
sance of the south Atlantic and the entire
west coast of Africa. Underlying this
exploration was the dream of sailing
round a continent which was still little
known to Europeans, in order to reach
the Indies. The most amazing feature of
this enterprise was that it should have
been pursued for so long by a single coun¬
try, Portugal, which often employed
foreigners (Genoese, Catalans, even
Castillans) in its service, while ether,
much richer and more powerful nations,
which also possessed a maritime tradition,
made no attempt to follow suit. The main
reason for this was that most of the
Portuguese voyages were not private un¬
dertakings like those of the great
Genoese, Catalan and Venetian shipown¬
ers of the same period, or of the later
French and English navigators, but a kind
of state enterprise, even though their
initiator was a prince, Henry the Navi¬
gator, and not the king.
The Portuguese maritime adventure
was modern both in its means and in its
results, but paradoxically it was
"medieval" in character. By this we mean
that it was simultaneously technical, mer¬
cantile and religious in character! When
Camôes wrote his epic a century and a
half after the beginnings of maritime
exploration, in a context that was already
fully modern, this medievalism still domi¬
nated his vision of the world.
The aim pursued by the Portuguese
navigators was tantamount to a crusade.
The Christian cross emblazoned on the
sails of their caravels was more than
merely symbolic. At that period, from a
really "modern", bourgeois standpoint
like that of the Genoese or the Venetians,
such an emblem would have been seen as
an obstacle to communication with peo¬
ples of other cultures and religions. But
the Portuguese voyages of exploration in
the fifteenth century were undertaken on
the initiative of an institution that was
both religious and military, not to say
militant. Later the enterprise became
"royal" and therefore more "secular"if
such a word had any meaning in the Por-

tugal of that time. But the religious aspect
of the discoveries was always present.
This is what made them an extremely
complex episode in the history of
Western culture.
No one understood this complexity
better than Camôes. He celebrated the
discoveries both as an extraordinary ad¬
venture of the human spirit, a fantastic
acceleration in our knowledge of the
universe and its mysteriesin other
words, a challenge assumed by men
against the godsand as a crusade by
Christian man, bearer of a faith that had
recently been assaulted in other parts of
Europe.
A unique poem in European as well as
Portuguese culture, The Lusiads has always
provoked perplexity as well as admiration
among figures as various as Cervantes and
Ezra Pound. It was written at a turning
point in history. Its context is the end of
the Renaissancea twilight era full of
energy and sensualitybut also the dawn
of the baroque age, with its ambiguous
interplay between day and night. Camôes
combines glorification of the daring
modernity of his countrymen's maritime
exploits with a fascination for ancient cul¬
tural models. Yet this attraction is far
from passive. Indeed, it contains an ele¬
ment of challenge. Literally and figurati¬
vely, The Lusiads stands at a crossroads in
history when the West, and especially the
Iberian peninsula, was hesitating between
exposure to a new historical situation, of
which the discoveries were themselves
the signal, and withdrawal into ethical
and religious certainties which had been
shaken by the material and conceptual
upheavals of the Renaissance.
Camôes emphasizes above all the chi¬
valrous aspects of the Portuguese disco¬
veries. But this chivalry, unlike that
evoked by the Italian poet Ariosto
(1472-1533), is realistic rather than dream¬
like. He rejects the moral disorder which
conquering expansion brought in its
wakethe unbridled ambition, the cor¬
ruption, the abuse of power, whose devas¬
tating effects he saw for himself in the
East.
Above alland this is where the poem
elevates a national epic to the dignity of
a universal mythhe was not content to
transpose the Portuguese voyages into a
heroic episode in the history of planetary
discovery. He transmuted them into a
kind of noble hymn to Eros, a naturalis¬
tic but also neo-Platonic version of the
great Italian poet Petrarch's "Triumph of
Universal Love", in which the Portu¬
guese in a sense play the role of Argo¬
nauts. Petrarch's celebrated theme, still an
colours of a new alliance between
peoples.
Of course, the poem is marked by cer¬
tain Western prejudices. It belongs to an
era in which religious militancy was par¬
ticularly fierce since Westerners felt that
their faith was threatened. Despite this
inevitable eurocentrism, and thanks to its
universalist impulse, its ethical force, and
its treatment of the whole range of
human physical and spiritual experience,
The Lusiads is far from being a mere
eulogy of the Portuguese discoveries as an
episode in the history of a people. Even
more than a great hymn to a glorious
moment in the destiny of Portugal, it is
the epic of the European movement to
new shores, to infinite possibilities in
space and time.
abstract vision, becomes in the hands of
Camôes fully dionysiac, a link and a place
of harmony not only between Heaven
and Earth but between humanity
hitherto divided by space, race and pre¬
judice. All Nature participates in the feast

Gama's sailors. In the "Island of Love"
episode, what begins as a hymn of natio¬
nal rejoicing becomes an epic of love, in
which spirit and senses mingle. The

CAMOES AND BRAZIL
BY JOSUÉ DE SOUZA MONTELLO

Portuguese colonization of
Brazil began after the arrival of
Pedro Alvares Cabrai in 1500.
In the 16th century settlement
was limited to the coastal plain.
Penetration into the hinterland
in the 17th and 18th centuries
was largely carried out by
groups of adventurers known as
bandeirantes, who went far
beyond the limits which the
Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) had established to
divide Portuguese and Spanish spheres of influence
in the Americas. "A country the size of a
continent" thus came into being, with almost
half the area and half the population of South
America. At the beginning of the 19th century the
new state obtained independence virtually without
conflict, and Dom Pedro, son of the king of
Portugal, was proclaimed emperor.
Despite the violence inherent in any form of
conquest, in the 15th and 16th centuries the
Portuguese gave priority to sea-borne trade as
opposed to military occupation. In the 17th century
they began to consider the region as a second

homeland rather than simply as an overseas
colonial market. According to the Brazilian social
anthropologist Gilberto Freyre, this process of
integration is due to the fact that at the outset of
her age of global expansion Portugal had been
enriched by cultural and ethnic interchange between
Europe and Africa.
The writings ofLuis de Camôes play an
important role in the fraternity of Portuguese and
Brazilian cultures. In the view of Brazilian writers
such as Manuel Bandeira and Josué de Souza
Montello, Camôes' work is a familiar landmark in
the cultures ofall the Portuguese-speaking peoples
and a bond between them.

BRAZIL does not figure largely in
the corpus of Camôes' writings,
yet the great Portuguese poet has
had a profound and highly significant in¬
fluence on Brazilian literature, both
directly and through the numerous
studies that have been made of his work.
The imprint of Camôes is evident in
the clarity of the heroic, eight-line stan¬
zas of Prosopopeia, an epic poem inspired
by the impressions evoked by a new
land and new people, by Bento Teixeira,
one of our earliest poets and considered
by some as the father of Brazilian liter¬
ature. In his Historia Concisa da Liter¬
atura Brasileira, in the introduction to
a chapter on the most important
authors of the colonial period, Alfredo
Bosi, one of the most knowledgeable
specialists in this field, writes: "There is
constant imitation of Camôes' Lusiads,
including the use of the same textual
structure, mythological allusions and
even specific turns of phrase."
The greatness of a poet lies not only in his own writings but
also in the works he inspires and in his acceptance as a model-
as though his contemporaries and successors want to revolve wi¬
thin his orbit. Permeating the different literary trends, from ba¬
roque to romanticism, from realism to symbolism, and even to
modernism, the undisputed influence of Camôes has affected
poet, essayist and critic.
Joachim Maria Machado de Assis (1839-1908), as great a poet
as he was a writer of prose, did not hesitate to admit Camôes'
influence. Nor did Alberto de Oliveira (1857-1937) who, by vir¬
tue of his masterly handling of the strict formalism of Parnassi¬
an verse, his vision, the breadth of his poetic work and the
technical competence with which it is executed, has become ac¬
cepted as the leading Brazilian of this school, in any way dis¬
count the ascendancy of Camôes.
The following anecdote illustrates the great devotion to
Camôes of the author of Cançôes Románticas (1878). One day,
while at the Brazilian Academy of Letters, Oliveira was stricken
with a sudden respiratory problem. His doctor, Professor Aloysio
de Castro, immediately came to his aid, but, instead of proffer¬
ing him the usual medicaments, he quoted a line from The Lu¬
siads and then asked from which stanza it came. Whereupon,
Alberto de Oliveira, who by then was an old man, recited in
a low and quavering voice the entire section of The Lusiads from
which the line came. Then, suddenly, with a smile on his lips,
he informed the doctor that his malaise had disappeared.
At the time of the rise of Modernism, Manuel Bandeira
(1886-1968), originally a poet of the Symbolist school, wrote the
following sonnet, inspired by Camôes' poetry, while in a sanato¬
rium in Switzerland in which he found himself in the company
of the French poet Paul Eluard.
When the nostalgic humours of your race
With heavy doom clouds do the soul downweigh,
Seek still the glory time cannot efface
In the heroic beauty of your lay.
Genius through misfortune brought to grace
Warrior poet, Nature's non-pareil,
Love of the homeland, Portugal, blessed place,
In you there burns with fire as bright as day.
wmxww*
Motifs inspired by the Americas, including representations of Brazilian Indians, appear in
Portuguese art from the 16th century onwards. Above, allegory of the Americas on painted and
glazed tiles (azulejos) is in the Municipal Museum at Viana do Castelo, Portugal.
While yet ring through our minds the fiery lays
Of that proud stock who dangers did defy
On every continent the cross to raise.
For want of soldiers, poets, shall not die
The tongue in which you boldly sang in praise
Of mighty deeds of arms and blazons high.
In my opinion, this short poem is the most beautiful tribute
rendered to the work of Camôes by Brazilian literature, through
the medium of one of its greatest contemporary poets.
What are the essential merits of Camôes' work? In the first
place, its rich variety of forms of expression, brilliantly adapt¬
ed to the poet's own feelings and to the sensibility of the peo¬
ple to which he belonged, at a time when Portugal was
consolidating its expansion. At times, the care Camôes devotes
to poetic expression and his continual concern for innovative
techniques make him seem surprisingly modern.
Having scoured the literature written in Portuguese in search
of a refinement comparable to that of Camôes, I can only con¬
firm that Portuguese poetry from medieval times to the present
day has been extraordinarily enriched by that clarity which is
one of the essential characteristics of Camôes work.
Finally, here is another revealing anecdote. In his book Vida
e Morte do Bandeirante ("Life and Death of the Bandeirante"),
which is a compilation, based on a variety of legal documents,
of the major episodes in the conquest of the hinterland of Brazil
in which Portuguese, Spaniards and Brazilians took part,
Antonio Castilho de Alcántara Machado (1901-1935) refers to
the literary works mentioned in these documents, whether in
wills or in inventories. There he found the works of Camôes
alongside those of Quevedo; the epic, lyric poet beside the Span¬
ish master satirist. And one bandeirante did in fact write his
will on the back of a page of The Lusiads.
JOSUE DE SOUZA MONTELLO, Brazilian writer, has published many
novels, plays and social and political studies which have earned him literary
prizes both in Brazil and abroad. A member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters,
the Portuguese Academy of History and the International Academy of Portu¬
guese Culture, he is currently serving as his country's Ambassador to Unesco.

BY IBN IYASRIVALRY IN THE RED SEA
Portugal's impact on the fortunes ofMamluk Egypt
¿r\
^¡Jrfk^~,t
"Arab merchants inhabiting the strait of Mecca, on the side of Arabia", the inscription on this illustration from a Portuguese codex is testimony to
the Portuguese presence in the Red Sea in the 16th century (see caption page 25).
Ibn Iyas, born in 1448 in Cairo, was the author of
a 6-volume history of Egypt, totalling over 3,000
pages. The chronicle opens, as was the custom at that
time, with the creation of the world and closes in
1522, shortly before its author's death.
During the last period recorded by Ibn Iyas,
Mamluk Egypt was experiencing her final days of
glory. The Egyptians were faced with a dual
challenge. To the north-east, Ottoman Turkey was
exerting growing pressure as a prelude to her
domination of the entire Islamic world. To the
north-west, Portugal, whose ships had rounded
Africa, thus gaining access to the trade routes of the
Indian Ocean, was threatening to destroy the
commercial lifeline which linked Egypt and the
Arab world with southern Asia.
In 1498, three ships under the command of Vasco
da Gama had dropped anchor at Calicut,
on the south-west coast of India.
The first European ships to reach India, they were
followed by fleet after fleet of Portuguese
merchantmen. In 1500, an Egyptian fleet lying
off Calicut was bombarded by the Portuguese,
and Portuguese vessels were stationed at the outlet
of the Red Sea to bar the way to Egyptian and
Arab ships bound for the Indian trade routes.
Egypt was to concede defeat on both counts. She
lost control of the seas at around the same time as
she relinquished her political independence to
Constantinople. For four long centuries, Egypt
would be shown on the maps of the Ottoman
empire as a mere administrative division.
We publish below an extract from Ibn Iyas'
lively and detailed account of this
dramatic turnabout in the history of Egypt,
in which he concentrates on the effect that the
Portuguese were having on Arab trade and on
Egyptian life.

RABÍ II 9II* (September 1505): The sultan formed an
expeditionary force to resist European incursions along
the coast of India. A large number of soldiers were
mobilized and the preparation of equipment was actively
pursued.
Djoumada II (November): This force included reservists
and Mamluks of the sultan's guard, most of whom were
Maghrebians, black archers and Turkomans. The sultan added
masons, carpenters and labourers to their number to build for¬
tified towers and a wall to surround the city of Jeddah. On Mon¬
day 6 (4 November) the army corps which had been assembled
for the Indian expedition left Cairo, to the cheers of a great
crowd. Husayn Mouchrif commanded the Mamluks, the Tur¬
komans and the Blacks, and the Maghrebians were under the
orders of Nour al-din Maslati. These troops, who had to travel
to Jeddah by sea, left Cairo to embark at Suez. By order of
the sultan, they were accompanied by a number of vessels load¬
ed with provisions and weapons.
Safar 912 (July 1506): News was received of the detachment
on its way to India to resist the European incursions. As soon
as he arrived at Jeddah, the commander-in-chief Husayn had
begun to construct towers along the coast, with the collabora¬
tion of Sonqour, the armourer, and Maslati, the Maghrebian.
This was the wisest thing to do, and the constructions were
very fine. The same army seized the port of Suakin unopposed,
the spices stored there were confiscated and the population
deported. The sultan greatly rejoiced at these successes.
Dhoul-Hidjdja (April-May 1507): The courier of the pil¬
grimage came back to report that the Egyptian army had
entered Mecca and had made the Pious Halt at Arafat. He added
that the Europeans were still making forays along the Indian
coast; that Husayn, the commander in chief of the army bound
for India, had begun the construction of towers on the shore
near Jeddah as well as round the city itself; and that ships were
ready to leave for Aden. The sultan appeared pleased with this
news. Later, the audacity of the Europeans knew no bounds:
over twenty of their ships dared to enter the Red Sea, attack¬
ing the Indian merchant vessels, lying in ambush to intercept
the convoys, and seizing cargoes, with the result that the impor¬
tation of many goods was interrupted. Because of this it was
very difficult to procure turbans and muslin veils in Egypt.
It was said that the Europeans had succeeded in breaching
the sea wall built by Alexander the Macedonian, son of Philip.
This breach had been made in a stretch of land separating the
sea route to China from the Mediterranean. For years the
Europeans had been desperately trying to widen this opening
to allow their vessels to enter the Red Sea. Such had been the
beginnings of this commercial, war.
Cha'ban 914 (December 1508): It was learned that the army
sent to India under the command of Amir Husayn had won
a victory over the Europeans who were overrunning the Indian
Ocean. A great quantity of booty had been taken. On the orders
of the sultan, who was overjoyed with this news, the sound
of drums resounded for three days together. Husayn asked for
reinforcements to bring the European troops to their knees.
11 Moharram 915 (1 May 1509): The chamberlain, Ala ad-
din, left for Tor to oversee the construction of vessels inten¬
ded for the Indian expedition.
Safar 915 (June 1509): It was learned that the army in India,
commanded by Husayn Mouchrif, had suffered a crushing
defeat. The Europeans had wiped it out and had plundered all
its ships. The sultan appeared extremely dismayed by this news.
Safar 916 (May 1510): An envoy from the Prince of
Cambay, Mahmoud Shah, together with other Indian nobles,
brought missives in which these princes insisted that troops
should be sent to the Indian coast, which was overrun with
European pirates. The audacity of the Europeans knew no
bounds and, following their victory over Husayn, the
commander of the Egyptian expeditionary force, they were
contemplating settling in the country.
Thursday, 30 Ramadan 918 (9 December 1512): This day
saw the return, after an absence of almost seven years and three
months, of Amir Husayn, the same who had led the Indian
expedition. In the course of his campaign he had fought
engagements with the Europeans and had thus been faced with
many tribulations and untold dangers. It will be recalled that
he had been responsible for the construction of the surroun¬
ding wall and towers at Jeddah and that these were fine pieces
of workmanship. At that time he had taken on the role of gover¬
nor of Jeddah and had shown himself to be arbitrary and
conceited. A tax of ten per cent had been imposed on merchants,
and the people, who had greatly suffered under his injustices,
had found him intolerable. He had established friendly rela¬
tions with certain Indian princes and, on his return to Egypt,
he brought back an envoy from King Mozaffar Shah ibn Mah¬
moud, Prince of Cambay, whose father had recently died. This
diplomat had come to ask the caliph to accord diplomatic cre¬
dentials to Mozaffar Shah. The sultan issued courtly robes to
Amir Husayn and to this envoy, and they left the Citadel in
solemn procession.
Year 920 (1514): No cargo was delivered at the port of Jed¬
dah because of the European corsairs sailing in the Indian
Ocean. It had been at least six years since merchandise had been
unloaded in the port of Jeddah.

by the Portuguese in the 16th century as part of their trading network
around the Indian Ocean, was a centre of Portuguese and Arab rivalry
for over a century.
Thursday, 13 Djoumada 1 920 (6 July 1514): A detachment
was assembled to go to India with the aim of resisting the Eu¬
ropean attacks, which we had heard were again on the increase.
Thursday, 20 Djoumada I 920 (13 July 1514): The gover¬
nor of Jeddah made it known that the Europeans were con¬
tinuing their attacks on the Yemen coast and that they had just
taken Kamaran, the trading-post for Indian merchandise in the
Red Sea. General Husayn begged the sultan to send reinforce¬
ments before the Europeans occupied the entire Yemen coast.
Moreover he feared that there would be an attack on Jeddah.
Monday, 12 Djoumada I 921 (24 June 1515): The sultan
took up quarters at the Hippodrome to review the fifth regi¬
ment. More than 600 of these soldiers were conscripted to go
to India; among their number were young recruits, Mamluks
of the sultan's guard, veterans and reservists. Having been told
of the ravages that the Europeans were constantly perpetrat¬
ing in the Indian Ocean, which was overrun with European
ships, the sultan decided to have some twenty ships built at Suez,
and to load them with weapons, guns, and cannons, as well as
with other engines of war. Salman the Ottoman was appoint¬
ed admiral of this fleet, with many seamen under his command,
both Ottoman and Maghrebian, in all 2,000 men, perhaps more.
Having picked the soldiers, the sultan asked them to leave as
soon as possible.
The month of Cha'ban 923 (August 1517): This month
saw the return of the Ottoman admiral, Salman, who had ac¬
companied the flotilla sent to India by Sultan Ghauri. It was
then learned that this admiral had had Husayn, the governor
of Jeddah, thrown into the sea. This was the outcome of an
old quarrel, going back to the reign of Ghauri. After the lat-
ter's death, Salman, now the more powerful of the two, had
killed Husayn: such at any rate was the rumour. Salman brought
back a certain number of Europeans captured in the Indian
Ocean, where they were engaged in a trade war and were in¬
tercepting merchant ships traversing those waters. Admiral
Salman, together with Husayn, had conquered several Indian
towns, which had brought them untold riches.
The month of Djoumada II 924 (June 1518): According
to sources in Mecca, European corsairs were sailing in the Red
Sea and intercepting merchant ships. The sharif had sent a report
to the prince of the amirs, governor of Egypt, requesting him
to send an expeditionary force as soon as possible, because fears
were mounting of a surprise attack on the port of Jeddah, and
the Muslims could not prevent the city's defeat.
Ramadan 925 (September 1519): It was learned from Mecca
that the presence of around forty European vessels had been
reported in the Red Sea, in the vicinity of Jeddah, which were
attacking and intercepting merchant ships. In the light of this
information, the prince of amirs, governor of Egypt, after a
review of Circassian Mamluks and other troops, designated
some 300 soldiers, both Mamluks and volunteer horsemen, to
escort the pilgrims and to establish a garrison at Jeddah in order
to resist the Europeans in the event of a surprise attack.
Thursday 28 Ramadan 925 (23 September 1519): This was
the day of departure for the corps bound for the port of Jed¬
dah. The contingent which started its march this day was made
up of Circassian Mamluks and Turkomans, in all some 300 men
who had been taken from these two regiments. The comman¬
der was an Ottoman named Husayn, commander of the light
cavalry. They went to Suez, from whence they embarked on
the Red Sea for Jeddah. The destructive raids of the Europeans,
who were sailing in the vicinity of the port ofJeddah and were
terrorizing merchants, were much spoken of at this time.

'CHRISTIANS AND SPICES'
The Portuguese in India BY JOHN CORREIA AFONSO
CAMOES masterpiece The Lusiads, Portugal's national
epic, tells the story of a small nation which in the space
of a little over a century carried its flag and its faith
far across the seas to Africa, to Brazil and as far away as Japan.
Singing of "heroes who, leaving their native Portugal behind
them, opened the way to Ceylon and beyond, across seas no
man had ever sailed before", it reminds us that Portugal played
an important part in unrolling "the Great Map of Mankind"
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, beginning with Vasco
da Gama's great voyage to India in 1497-1498.
We do not deal here with the impulses behind the Age of
Discovery. Suffice it to mention that, according to British
historian Charles Boxer, the four main motives which inspired
the Portuguese were, in chronological order: crusading zeal;
desire for Guinea gold; the quest for Préster John*; and the
search for spices.
Whatever their motives, the Portuguese, by their discover¬
ies, not only extended the limits of the world known to Europe,
but contributed greatly to its more accurate representation. At
the end of the fifteenth century, a revolutionary cartographi¬
cal innovation was made with the introduction of a scale of
latitudes, and subsequently, following the great discoveries,
Portugal became the European centre for geographical and car¬
tographical knowledge. Alberto Cantino's famous planisphere
(1502) is the earliest dated map to delineate the Portuguese dis¬
covery of India (see centre colour pages).
However, the Portuguese did more than sail and chart the
seas. They also traded, and conquered and settled lands. The
domination of the Portuguese on the coasts and seas of Africa
and Asia is essentially and peculiarly connected with the be¬
ginnings of that maritime expansion of Europe and Christen¬
dom, which, above all else, marks off the modern from the
medieval world.
Here indeed was the beginning of a New Age, for before
the Iberian discoveries the most striking feature of the history
of civilization was the dispersion and isolation of the different
branches of mankind.
As Boxer points out, "it was the Portuguese pioneers and
the Castilian conquistadores from the western rim of Christen¬
dom, who brought together, for better or for worse, the wide¬
ly sundered branches of the great human family. They thus first
made humanity conscious, however dimly, of its essential
unity."
This unity was given new meaning by the bonds of trade.
Not only were the two hemispheres brought closer to each
other, but the European merchants engaged in coastal trade also
helped to bring parts of Asia closer to one another, linking In¬
dia, South-East Asia, China and Japan.
The Portuguese also showed Europe how to trade profita¬
bly in areas of advanced civilization, and although they were
not devoid of cruelty in their relations with native princes and
their peoples, their relations with native rulers were generally
speaking based on mutual respect and even "cousinly"
friendship.
Contrary to popular belief, the Portuguese were more con¬
cerned with trade than with conquest. In the sixteenth centu¬
ry, there were probably no more than 10,000 able-bodied
Portuguese in all Portugual's overseas territories. It would have

been foolish of them to believe that
India could be conquered and held by
such small numbers. And so the high-
sounding term Estado da India ("State
of India") in fact designated basically
a series of trading posts along commer¬
cial sea routes controlled by Portugal
in varying degrees.
If desire for commercial gain rather
than military or political motives was
the driving force behind Portuguese
expansion, this was allied to evangeli¬
cal and missionary zeal. The reported
answer of Vasco da Gama's men when
questioned at Calicut about the reason
for their long journey is well known:
"Christians and spices", they alleged¬
ly replied. This close association
between God and Mammon was the
hall-mark of the empire founded by the
Portuguese in the East, and, for that
matter, in Africa and in South America.
Catholicism of a rather autocratic
nature, and the fact that in territories
under Portuguese control no effort was
made to adapt Western Christianity to the culture and outlook
of the Indian people, has led many historians to regard Por¬
tuguese evangelism as a phase in and a tool of European expan¬
sion. Others maintain that the missionaries did to some degree
seek to divorce themselves from the political and economic am¬
bitions of their fellow-countrymen.
It is often claimed that there was.no colour-bar or racial
discrimination in the Portuguese colonies. This is an exaggera¬
tion. It is true that the Portuguese were usually more liberal
in this respect than the Dutch, the English or the French
colonizers. On the whole the Portuguese rulers took the line
that religion and not colour should be the criterion for full
Portuguese citizenship, and that all Asian converts to Chris¬
tianity should be treated as the equals of their Portuguese co¬
religionists. Yet for a very long time the religious orders in the
Portuguese possessions would not admit non-whites to their
ranks and, in India, among the Portuguese themselves, odious
distinctions were made between the Reinois (those born in
Portugal itself) and the Indiaticos (those born in Asia of
Portuguese parents). In India, the Portuguese kings usually
favoured the policy of inter-racial marriages initiated by Afonso
de Albuquerque, the conqueror of Goa.
Another reason for the greater permanence of Portuguese
influence in Asia was the wide acceptance of their language,
which became a commercial linguafranca in the East. Even the
Dutch, who defeated the Portuguese at sea, found that it was
futile to take drastic measures against the use of Portuguese,
which was "an easy language to speak and easy to learn".
Vasco da Gama sighted India on 18 May 1498, and two days
later dropped anchor a few kilometres north of Calicut, at the
port of Capocate. It was not till the end of the month that he
was received by the Zamorin (ruler) of Calicut who was far
from impressed by the gifts da Gama brought, although appar¬
ently pleased with the contents of the letters of which he was
the bearer.
A second Portuguese fleet, under Pedro Alvares Cabrai,
arrived in 1501. Cabrai became embroiled in a quarrel with the
Zamorin, and, learning that the ruler of the rival port of Cochin
hated the Zamorin and was eager to trade with the Portuguese,

he called at Cochin, established friendly relations there, and
loaded a cargo of pepper. Next he made friends with the Rajah
of Cannanore.
However, the most important event in the establishment of
the Portuguese Estado da India was the capture of Goa from the
forces of the Sultan of Bijapur in November 1510. Goa provided
the Portuguese with an excellent natural harbour and was better
situated than Cochin as a naval base. This conquest also convinced
the Indian rulers that the Portuguese meant to stay. Moving north¬
wards along the west coast of India, the Portuguese also acquired
the ports of Bassein, Bombay, Daman (Damào) and Diu.
The Portuguese were the first Europeans to establish them¬
selves in India, and the last to leave. Four and a half centuries
were to pass between the conquest of Goa and the lowering
of the Portuguese flag in that territory in 1961. During that
time they put down deeper roots than did the Dutch, the
English and the French elsewhere in India. One has only to
travel along the west coast of India to see the stamp of the
Portuguese presence. Religion, language, architecture, music,
cuisinethese are some of the areas in which we recognize
Lusitanian traits.
As the Portuguese chronicler Joäo de Barros wrote in 1540:
"The Portuguese arms and pillars placed in Africa and in Asia,
and in countless isles beyond the bounds of three continents,
are material things, and time may destroy them. But time will
not destroy the religion, customs and language which the Por¬
tuguese have implanted in these lands." Pretentious as this
prophecy may sound, it has, in fact, been substantially borne
out for four and a half centuries.

The voyages of discovery strongly influenced the Late Gothic form of Portuguese architectural ornamentation known as the "Manueline" style, in
which marine and nautical motifs are prominent. Above, pillars and vaulting of the Jerónimos monastery in Lisbon, one of the most typical

PORTUGUESE ART
IN THE MARITIME ERA
BY RAFAEL DE FARIA D. MOREIRA
DURING Portugal's Golden Age
of Discoveryfrom the conquest
of Ceuta, Morocco, in 1415, to
the death of Prince Henry the Navigator
in 1460 Portuguese art was predominant¬
ly Gothic, then the common aesthetic
standard throughout the Western world.
Yet this was not the exuberant, florid
Gothic of the great French cathedrals, but
a simpler, more down-to-earth, less eru¬
dite and intellectual version, closer
perhaps to the vernacular and to the less
ornamental architecture of the mendicant
religious orders and of the Cistercians. In
modest buildings such as the still essen¬
tially Romanesque Hermitage of Our
Lady of Guadaloupe, near Sagres, and
constructions built to a serene, rigorous¬
ly geometric design (such as the lesser
cloisters of the monasteries of Batalha and
Tomar) it is possible to detect the per¬
sonal tastes of Henry the Navigator. His
was a classical ideal of beauty which
found its full expression in the canvases
of the court painter Nuno Gonçalves
whose paintings exude a powerful mystic
force and a sentiment of respect for the
value of the individual (see pages 2 and 8).
It would, however, be a mistake to
take this Franciscan humility as a sign of
weakness. According to Reynaldo dos
Santos, the polyptych for Säo Vicente, six
panels painted by Nuno Gonçalves for
the See of Lisbon between 1460 and 1465,
as the city's tribute to the leader of the
conquest of Morocco, "reflects a new vi¬
sion of Nature and of man". As redolent
of Mediterranean humanism as it is of
nordic realism, this work is one of the
masterpieces of European painting.
Moreover, the buildings in English Late
Gothic style (such as those built by the
French architect Huguet between 1402
and 1438 at the monastery of Batalha), the
Tuscan-style paintings that Prince Henry
seems to have admired so much (proba¬
bly the work of Joâo Gonçalves who in
1432 painted the fine Renaissance frescoes

in the Abbey of Florença) as well as the
Moorish style of the Royal Palace at
Sintra where King Joäo I (1385-1433)
received foreign envoys and visitors
(among them the great Flemish painter
Jan van Eyck) in exotic surroundings
suited to his status as "Lord of Ceuta",
are all contemporary aesthetic manifesta¬
tions whose cosmopolitan nature is an
expression of human diversity and
receptivity.
Once feudal dominion over the
Maghreb had been established, the sea¬
borne thrust towards India became
Portugal's national goal. Old legends
were revived, fuelled by medieval
accounts of fantastic voyages, of the
conquests of Alexander the Great and
tales of Troy which pictured Asia as a
region of fabulous wealth inhabited
mainly by Christians. To the subjects of
King Joäo II (1455-1495), an alliance with
Préster John was not only a possibility
but a necessity in the context of expan¬
sionist ambitions in which greed for gold
became inextricably mixed up with the
goal of recapturing Jerusalem and spread¬
ing the Christian message.
This ideal undoubtedly had a strong
influence on the arts and on the collec¬
tive "cultural imagination". Even before
the "discovery" of the sea route to India
(which was not achieved until Vasco da
Gama landed at Calicut in 1498, although
after 1486 it was considered only a mat¬
ter of time), the mere expectation of such
a great feat was enough to provoke a
heightened tension in the final phase of
the Gothic in Portugal. The situation in
the arts at the end of the fifteenth centu¬
ry, with its experiments in the incorpo¬
ration of the exotic (through such hybrid
forms as Afro-Portuguese ivory art) and
the lavish ornamentation favoured by the
artists at court, could be seen as a prepa¬
ration for Vasco da Gama's "encounter
with history".
There has been much discussion about
oriental influences on the development of
the distinctively Portuguese style, known
as Manueline art as a tribute to King
Manuel I (1469-1521) who gave it the
standing of official style of the kingdom.
It has rightly been pointed out that direct
contact with Indian art would only have
occurred after the process of conquest
was well advanced. It was, however, an
"imagined India" rather than any direct
influence from the subcontinent that
proved suck an irresistible fount of im¬
pressions and experiences.
Whatever its source, Manueline art
was first and foremost a royal, Christian
art, strongly linked to the medieval tra-

dition and to a system of mythical values
of which this style claimed to be the
definitive statement. It was a "modern"
art form in the sense that it adopted con¬
temporary thought as a strident and eu¬
phoric affirmation of faith in history.
Nothing could be more instructive than
to observe the way in which the king had
himself portrayed in these worksas a
man, kneeling in the divine presence as
a humble donor; as a king, in the regalia
of one of the Three Kings or as King
David, that is to say, as one who leads the
way to an era of greatness.
Let us take as examples of this com¬
plex symbolic framework reflecting the
Manueline notion of modernity two
related monuments (both recently in¬
scribed by Unesco on the World Heritage
List) in which the intervention of King
Manuel can be seen. Along the River
Tagus on the outskirts of Lisbon, at
Réstelo, the point of departure of succes¬
sive fleets on their voyages of discovery,
the huge Jerónimos monastery houses the
tombs of the king and his family, guard¬
ed by a small extravagantly decorated
fort. There, at the gateway to the ocean,
at the most westerly point of Europe, the
monastery (begun in 1501) and the Tower
of Belém (1514) are monuments to the
wealth and invincible power of the king
who ordered their construction.
Further north, at Tomar in central
Portugal, stands the Monastery of Christ,
built by the military Order of Christ,
which played an important role in the
voyages of discovery. In 1510, the origi¬
nal rotunda of the church was extended
by the addition of a huge nave, the
proportions of which were identical with
those of the Sistine Chapel in the Vati¬
can and which was intended, like the Sis-
tine Chapel, as a setting for great and
solemn ceremonies. The famous window
in the upper part of the west façade is an
epitome of the aesthetic message of
Manueline art, a piece of religious and
political rhetoric transposed into stone.
However, the Golden Age announced
by the ideologists of the Portuguese court
and visually expressed by the artists of the
time was to lose its attractionand the
Manueline style was to lose its topicality
with the turning of the page marked by the
end of the great discoveries (without any
of the millenarian prophecies being ful¬
filled) and with the bloody consolidation
of Portuguese power in the East.
Lord of the trade routes from Brazil
to Japan, first maritime power of the
modern era and one of the greatest of all
time, Portugal alone could be compared
to the Roman empire. Was Manueline art
to serve as a model for a new form of ar¬
tistic expression of the might of Christen¬
dom? Just as Portuguese power declined
throughout the sixteenth century, so too
did Manueline optimism wane; it was to
be the post-medieval spirit of the Italian
Renaissance that would satisfy the need for
a new form of artistic expression.

is a lecturer in the history of art at the New Uni¬
versity of Lisbon. He is the author of a monograph

FERNANDO PESSOA AND THE
SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY
BY JOSE AUGUSTO SEABRA
THE Portuguese voyages of disco¬
very left behind them a broad,
indelible wake on the surface of
modern history and culture. In literature,
not only did they inspire the sixteenth-
century epics of Camôes, they also pro¬
foundly marked the works of his spiri¬
tual successor, Fernando Pessoa,
Portugal's great modern poet. In Pessoa's
writings, however, the voyages of disco¬
very are treated not simply as a tribute
to a glorious past, but as a prophetic pro¬
jection of that past into the future. In the
first poem of his Mensagem ("Message"),
a collection of verse published in 1934,
Pessoa writes of the "future of the past",
and throughout the book he develops the
visionary, messianic theme of the "Fifth
Empire"1 and of the "Portuguese Sea"
symbolically spreading out to become the
"universal mother".
Two of Portugal's greatest poets, Luís de
Camôes and Fernando Pessoa, as portrayed by
the Portuguese artist José Almada Negreiros.
Pessoa, the poet of many hetero¬
nyms,2 made no attempt to duplicate
The Lusiads, the national epic that
recounts Vasco da Gama's voyage of dis¬
covery against the background of the his¬
tory of Portugal. Instead he transforms
his country's history into an initiatory
voyage with other ships and other sea¬
farers, symbolic figures on a spiritual
quest for the occult, like the quest for the
Holy Grail, under the banner of the
Rosicrucians. Dom Sebastian, the
"Longed-for, Hidden King" of the Por¬
tuguese, is the mythical embodiment of
that quest and his return, like that of
Ulysses, is awaited with endless patience.
Returning to the homeric sources and tra¬
cing through Greek, Roman, Christian
and European tradition, Pessoa announ¬
ces the advent of a "New Renaissance"
that Portugal would bring to the world

and whose minstrel would be a "Super-
Camôes".
This prophecy had already figured in
the first major writings to appear under
Pessoa's signature on his return to
Lisbon, fired with patriotism that had
religious and universalist overtones, fol¬
lowing his childhood and adolescence in
South Africa. These writings were pub¬
lished in the magazine A Aguia ("The
Eagle") of Oporto, the organ of the "Por¬
tuguese Renaissance" movement. In the
Republic then established in Portugal,
this movement preached the values of
"Lusitanian civilization", invoking
saudade1 in the sense of nostalgia for the
past, but also for the future.
Drawing inspiration from the move¬
ment's charismatic poet, Joaquim
Teixeira de Pascàoes (1877-1952), Pessoa
attempted to define the trends of the
"new Portuguese poetry", under the pre¬
text of carrying out a sociological and
psychological analysis, so as to draw from
it the elements of a poetic form of a sta¬
ture to match his exalted vision of new
caravels setting out to discover a "New
India", not an earthly geographical and
historical place but a transcendent land
of dream. "And its true, supreme destiny,
of which the deeds of the navigators were
but an obscure and flesh-bound dress
rehearsal, will achieve divine fulfilment"
he concludes, in an outburst of messia¬
nic zeal.
It can be sensed that, in his mysterious
pronouncements, the poet, who surrep¬
titiously equates himself with the "Super-
Camöes", takes as his starting point the
concept of "discovery", to which he
attaches more importance than to the
actual discoveries themselves, giving it a
new meaning which, like King Sebastian,
remains for ever hidden. He goes from
the exoteric to the esoteric; the more one
discovers about things external to oneself,
the more deeply is the truth hidden; error
piles upon error and deviation upon
deviation. The initiatory voyage is, in
fact, always an interior voyage. As he
wrote in another poem from Mensagem:
Far from ourselves we go in search
Of who we really are.
And in the same poem he talks of the
impossibility of return, since "God allows
us no departure".
In his writings Pessoa constantly harks
back to the Portuguese discoverers, whom
he sees as the creators of the "modern
world". But their discoveries were, above
all, a cultural, a "civilization-creating act".
This is why the founding of a colonial
empire never was and never would be of
importance to Portugal. "Colonies are not

depiction dating from the late 16th century.
necessary for what I imagine to be the des¬
tiny of Portugal", he wrote in 1934. For
Pessoa dreamed of a Portugal which he
conceived of as a "cultural empire" and a
"spiritual force". For the "ridiculous old-
fashioned imperialism" of the "generals"
and the "politicians" he substituted "the
imperialism of the grammarians" and "the
imperialism of the poets".
As the poet of a language become
homeland, a universal homeland, neverthe¬
less, with multiple tongues and many iden¬
tities, the Super-Camöes would be the poet
par excellence of this new imperialism. The
same Pessoa who wrote "my country is the
Portuguese language", also affirmed, faith¬
ful to his religious, Rosicrucian ecumenism,
that "God speaks every language".
This God who, in the spirit of Pessoa's
"neo-paganism", encompasses all other
gods, is not the God of Camôes. Nor are
the gods of the Mensagem the same as those
from pagan mythology who throng the
pages of The Lusiads, superimposing them¬
selves upon the Christian God. Pessoa's
gnostic brand of Christianity, like that of
the Templars, proclaims another kind of
"Holy War", the struggle for peace and
fraternity made possible by the Portuguese
discoveries which brought into contact the
beliefs and civilizations of East and West,
of North and South:
For God desired that all the world be one,
And that the sea unite and not divide.
This is the divine plan traced out in the
poem dedicated to Prince Henry the Navi¬
gator, the opening poem of the Portuguese
Sea, the second part of Pessoa's anthology.
And in The Ascension of Vasco da Gama,
after the "Gods of the Tempest", symbo¬
lized in myth as "The Monster", we see
"the heavens open up to receive the soul
of the Argonaut", the "Last Captain" who,
following the route traced and marked
with stone pillars by Diogo Cäo and
Bartolomeu Dias, finally rounded the Cape
of Good Hope and opened up the long-
dreamed-of route to India.
The "New India" has now become an
India where berth caravels built of "such
stuff as dreams are made on", where the
symbolic and the imaginary dissolve into
a new reality of which the myths of
"Sebastianism" and the "Fifth Empire" are
the poetic expression.
It is to this new spirit of discovery and
voyaging that Pessoa invites the Portuguese
of today: "We must begin by intoxicating
ourselves with this dream, absorbing it into
ourselves and embodying it... Then, in the
very soul of the Nation, will occur that un¬
foreseeable alchemy from which will spring
New Discoveries and the Creation of a
New World ..."
1. A reference to a myth which relates that King
Sebastian of Portugal, who died at the battle of
Alcazarquivir (1578), will one day return to found a
"Fifth Empire" of universal peace.
2. Pessoa created a series of alter egos ("heteronyms")
whom he endowed with their own life-stories and
whose poems he wrote for them. (See Unesco Courier,
November 1988).
3. A feeling of intense nostalgia and of being torn
between the call of the sea and attachment to the
homeland. Editor
