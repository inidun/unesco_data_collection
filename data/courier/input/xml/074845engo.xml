Aban, bearer
of cornstalks
This young woman bear¬
ing a bunch of cornstalks
in her left hand lived some
1,800 years ago in Qa-
taban, an ancient king¬
dom of southern Arabia,
lying northeast of pres¬
ent-day Aden. Her por¬
trait, sculpted in polished
limestone (detail shown
here) embellishes her
tomb on which her name
"Aban, of the clan of
Mahdar" is inscribed in
the Semitic language of
Qataban. The top of her
head, as is usual in pre-
Islamic South Arabian
portrait busts, is cut off
above the forehead, per¬
haps to carry some ad¬
junct to represent hair or
a head-dress. Aban's por¬
trait is 32 cm. high by
25 cm. wide.

In the province of Mithila, in northern India, only the women are
artists according to an ancient custom. Cover reproduces in colour a
Mithila painting entitled "Gopis" (see also page 34 and 4 pages of
colour). At a time when women are waging a global campaign against
male domination and anti-feminist prejudices, the works of Mithila's
women painters refute the outmoded idea that women are not artists.
In a previous issue devoted to International Women's Year (March 1975)

Africa and Latin America (the myth of "machismo") and the problems
of girls and women in schools, universities and jobs.

On the occasion of International
Women's Year, the "Unesco Cou¬
rier" devotes this double number
(a follow-up to its March 1975
issue) to different aspects of the
status of women today and to the
global struggle to eliminate the
discrimination of which women
are still the victims. From this
struggle there emerges the image
of a new woman who rejects the
taboos and outdated and humilia¬
ting stereotypes so long applied
to her sex. Thrusting aside
constraints, she intends hence¬
forth to play her full part in social,
cultural and political life. The
World Conference of International
Women's Year, which has just
taken place in Mexico City (see
article page 67) has demonstrat¬
ed the vigour and spirit of the
world-wide movement for wom¬
en's liberation.
Shy at being "taped", but smiling happily, a
woman from Upper Volta talks about her
life, her ideas and her experiences.

'I DIDN'T CHOOSE
MY HUSBAND
MY FATHER
GAVE ME TO
An inquiry by a Brazilian sociologist
on changing and unchanging conditions
of African village women in Upper Volta
by Claudia Fonseca
Debates on the status of women abound, but seldom does one have a chance to hear
directly from a "typical" village woman (if such a person actually exists). Often
illiterate, living beyond the reach of radio or television, she probably knows nothing
of abstract discussions on women's rights.
Yet, as I recently found during several months of interviews and field study in Africa,
the rural dweller, faced with simple but direct questions on the subject, has very
definite opinions.
The six persons five women and one man introduced below belong to the Kassena
people and live in the Pô region of Upper Volta, 150 km south of its capital,
Ouagadougou. The Kassena, numbering around 70,000, occupy an area of wooded
savannah on both sides of the Ghana-Upper Volta border.
A long dry season and mediocre soil severely limit farming in this region, although
over 90 per cent of the population are farmers who eke out a near subsistence level
existence on four kinds of millet and a few vegetables. For the most part, they are
scattered in villages of two to three hundred inhabitants, each composed of several
polygamous households organized on the basis of male descent and inheritance.
Except for a few recently converted Christians and Muslims, the Kassena observe
their traditional religion a mixture of animism, and cults of land and ancestors.
Modern commodities such as electricity and running water exist only in the district
capital, in the homes of a few officials.
None of the people interviewed has ever had such comforts. They are part of the
illiterate and often overlooked rural world that accounts for a large majority of the
country's population.
l/AUrr Kawe, about 35 years old, is the third wife of
IXrlilL Aliru, a small farmer. Her travels have never
carried her beyond this village of 500 inhabitants and her
birthplace, 40 kilometres away. We find her seated on the
patjo in front of her mud and straw hut, bathing her two-
month-old daughter.
How does a girl get a husband?
I didn't choose my husband. My father gave me to
CLAUDIA FONSECA, Brazilian social anthropologist, spent several
months in Upper Volta as adviser to Unesco's experimental project to
promote equal access to education for women and girls In that
country. She has also carried out considerable on-the-spot research
on the role of women in national development in Taiwan, Micronesia and
more recently in Brazil, where she is studying problems of the adaptation
of secondary schooling to rural areas.
him. I'm so old, I can't even remember how long ago
it was. I was very young and only knew that my older
"sister" (1) who was married to Aliru wanted me to come
and live here and help her cook and fetch water. I didn't
know I was to be her co-wife.
Then, when I became a woman, I went home to my
father's house for the excision ceremony. It was only
then that they said I must return and stay always with
Aliru because he was my husband. My sister decided the ^
marriage. I had no choice. Perhaps if I wanted to leave V

k now, I could, but why should I? My children are here,
and my peanut field.
Why do people divorce ?
If a woman does not like her husband, does not make
his dinner, and is cold towards him, the husband may
send her back to her family. A husband may beat his
wife if she refuses to do the things he tells her. But
a woman had better not hit her husband if she does,
she'll get the worst of it. I cannot even insult Aliru. If
I did, his grown children would take his side against me.
If a woman feels her husband does not want her, if he
doesn't come to her house even to drink water, or eat,
then she may leave him. He must go to her father's house
to get her back. If he doesn't... well... it's like losing
a chicken. If it goes to a neighbour's house, you must go
and get it back. Otherwise it'll belong to the neighbour.
But if a man has already made the ceremonial visits and
paid the bride-price to his wife's parents, he's sure to
insist that she return to him. Besides, the girl's father
wouldn't want to keep her with him, where she might set
a bad example for his own wives.
Who work harder, men or women ?
Ha! Women of course. The men have only their field
of millet to worry about. We must help the men in their
fields and plant our own fields of peanuts, corn, and
condiments too. It's hard to get everything done, especially
in the planting season. And then there .are meals to

Top left, a familiar scene in rural Africa : balancing
calabashes on their heads, women villagers fetch
water from the well for their families a traditional
woman's job. Left, an all-male meeting of villagers
grouped around their chief. But in Africa's develop¬
ing countries today, long-established
ideas about women's role and responsibilities are
changing. Above, an Upper Volta schoolgirl lifts a
questioning finger. She belongs to a generation
in search of new ideas and eager for knowledge.
prepare, flour to grind, and the house to clean, not to
mention looking after the babies. How often do you see
a woman wasting her time drinking in the dolo hut (a bar
selling millet beer) like the husbands? Why do you think
I'm so skinny? I eat plenty, but I have too many worries.
Do you have any money of your own ?
I don't have a very big peanut field, just enough for the
family, so I don't have much to sell. Last week, though,
I had some spare time so I made some shea-butter and
got a good price for it. Normally I might spend the money
on food, maybe onions or tomatoes, or some hot peppers.
But this time, my husband took the money. He needed
it because another wife, the young one, had just had a baby
at the dispensary, and besides the medicine, they made him
buy sheets and some clothes for the baby.
Who decides which children, boys
or girls, will go to school?
None of our children are in school, so I can't really say.
To enroll a child, you need a birth certificate, and only the
men know how to get that, so I guess they would decide.
The children really belong to my husband's family, so the
important thing is what the family wants.
I don't think any of the girls in our village have ever been
to school. It's too far away, and people are afraid the
girls will elope and not come home. I think it is better
perhaps to send a boy to school. After all, the boys will
bring their money back to their parents. A girl keeps
hers for her husband.
What responsibilities do you give
your sons and daughters ?
It's the mother's job to educate a daughter. She teaches
her to crush millet, to make millet cake, and fetch water
from the well. When she is nearly a woman, a daughter
may follow her mother and help her in the fields, or even
have her own field.
A son's education is the father's job. Young boys look
for termites for the chicks, and get water for the animals.
Later, they help their fathers in the fields. A boy obeys
his father more than his mother. If the mother sends her
son on an errand he doesn't want to do, the father may
say, "He's not a girl, so why send him on your business?"
Girls obey their mothers.
PAIII INF Pauline, 25, is her husband's only wife. She
rnULIIIL ¡s a Catholic and goes regularly to mass.
In addition to the traditional tasks of mother, housekeeper,
and farmer, she is a successful market trader.
Who work harder, men or women ?
I suppose men do, but really we each do our part.
Women take care of the home and children, but men do
the harder work in the fields. They clear all the land,
for our crops and theirs, and then they must cultivate the
big fields of millet far out in the bush. We only help
in the planting and, during the harvest, by winnowing
the grain and carrying it home. We only cultivate our
own small fields of condiments, closer to the house, and
even then, a lucky woman will have a few sons-in-law
to help her. So you see men and women both work hard.
Do you have any money of your own ?
Yes! I go to the markets, maybe every three or four
days, if I'm not sick or working in the bush. I sell millet
for my husband, and my own sumbara cheese or shea-
butter. But what brings in the most money is the millet
beer I make and sell on market day here in town. I make
good beer and good talk so I have lots of customers.
The money I get for the millet goes to the chief (her
husband's older brother). I keep some of the beer earnings
to buy condiments for our food, though most of that goes
to the chief too. But I keep all the money I make from ^

my butter and cheese. With it, I can afford fine gifts for
the funerals and feasts in my parents' house. I also buy
all my own kitchen equipmentenameled pots and pans,
earthenware jars, some spoons, and even a painted table.
My husband is ignorant of this sort of thing, so I take
care of it all myself.
The chief helps to buy clothes for me and my children.
But when I see something I like, I want to buy it right away,
without asking anyone. Sometimes, when I don't have
enough money, I go to the chief. He may complain that
I spend too much don't all men? but he'll help me get
what I want. The chief pays all our taxes and buys us
medicine when we need it.
What responsibilities do you give
your sons and daughters ?
In general, boys and girls do pretty much the same
work. I have only sons, so they often help me at home.
They never cook millet cake, but they often fetch water
for me, or sweep the house. If they disobey me without
good reason, their father punishes them. Like other boys,
they go hunting for termites and drive the cows home
at night. But in other families there are many girls who
watch the animals, especially when there are no sons.
Al/IIVAM Avuyan is the young, robust chief of a village
Hi U I nil 0f 1400 inhabitants. He has recently taken
a second wife with whom he spends much of his free time.
Although as a teenager he worked in Ghana's plantation
areas, and now is often busy with village responsibilities,
like most men he is basically a farmer. At dusk, we find
him relaxing after a day in the fields, holding his two-year-
old son in his lap.
How does a girl get a husband?
Her father chooses a husband for her but not without
asking his wife. If the wife has a good reason for refusing
the choice, she may do so. Of course, they also ask the
girl what she thinks, but if both parents agree and the
daughter refuses, they will be very upset. When they
see that a girl is growing breasts and that young men are
showing an interest in her, then it's time to find her
a husband. It's not a good idea to promise a girl in
marriage too early, because that gives her several years
to think about her husband and she may decide she doesn't
want him. Then it's a problem to return the dowry and
placate the husband. But, if a woman is already mature
when she is promised to a man, she may have a baby
soon after she marries and then she won't be able to
leave her husband so easily.
Why do people divorce ?
If a man asks his wife to do something for him and she
refuses, he will begin to wonder what's wrong maybe
thinking she has found another man. If she still refuses
the third time he asks her, they will fight, and she will
probably return to her family or go to another man.
If a husband makes his wife do hard work that is not
meant for women, she may protest, but she'll do it. If the
next day, he asks her again, and she's too tired, she may
then go back to her parents who will tell her she has
done right to leave him.
If a man beats his wife a lot, the parents will try to find
out who is in the wrong. If it's the man, the wife will be
taken back by her family. If it's the wife, she will be made
to stay with her husband and be scolded by her own family.
is spending. If there is plenty of millet, she simply says,
"Why do you ask me to sell millet every day? Are you
going to buy something new?" So he tells her, and she
says "fine". If there is not enough millet, she will say,
"How can you sell all this millet to buy a radio (or a
plough)? We won't have enough left to eat at the end
of the year."
Can women have their own money?
A woman who earns money at the market will either keep
it herself or give part of it to her husband for some big
expense. She cannot give it to her parents. But the
husband cannot force her to share it with him unless he
helped to finance her market deals. A rich woman may
buy animals and give them to her sons, but rarely owns
animals herself. If she does, sooner or later she will tend
to lose respect for her husband because she can do
everything he can.
Who decides which children, boys
or girls, will go to school?
Normally the father knows all about these things and
the wife knows nothing. But he will not enroll a child
without telling the mother. If she has a good reason for
not sending the child, she will say so. This year, I took
five children to the school in the district centre. One girl
was too old, but the other four, two girls and two boys,
were accepted. It is good to educate girls because they'll
either become government employees or else they'll marry
one. Either way the girl's family will profit because she
or her husband will be able to bring fine gifts and sometimes
money to her parents.
I/AOOA All* Kassaana, the only wife of a much older
rvnOOnrllln man_ ¡s about 50 years old. She is in her
kitchen hut shelling néré seeds. Her husband is sitting
on the terrace sewing some skins. He listens throughout
the interview but only adds a word here and there.
How does a girl get a husband?
How do they get husbands in your country? It's probably
the same way. My husband had already married twice,
but both wives were gone when I arrived. You can choose
a girl's husband for her if you like, but who's to say that
she'll stay and be happy?
Take my daughter. Didn't you see her dancing last
month at the feast? Well, after that, she left with a
"sister" who's married and living in the next district. That
girl told her she was lonely. She said they would have
more fun if they returned together to her husband's village.
Now we've heard our daughter is living with a younger
brother in the house. My husband sent three times for
her to come home, but she won't. She just called in once
to say she wanted to stay there for a while yet. We can't
order her to come home since she chose herself to go
to this man.
On the other hand, my son, who is older than his sisters,
is looking everywhere for a wife. He has already asked
two girls, but they just laughed at him. I hope it will be
How do you and your wives decide
about big expenses ?
The husband and wife will probably discuss together a big
purchase such as a radio or a plough. The wife always
knows when her husband is planning to buy something,
since she sells his millet and knows how much money he

This young woman lives in Pô, the Upper Volta
village 150 km south of Ouagadougou, the capital,
where the interviews with African women published
here took place. Like all the women of her village
she does the housework (top) brushing the floor
of her hut and polishing the calabashes and kitchen
utensils which hang on the wall. Below, standing on
her doorstep she rolls up a strip of matting before
storing it away. Looking after the home is a woman's
work, and one woman interviewed explains that
if she sends her son on an errand he does not wish to
do, her husband may scold her saying, "He's not a girl,
so why send him on your business?"
easier when his sisters marry. Then, we will receive many
animals we can use to buy a wife for our son.
Why do people divorce ?
How can I say? My husband has never mistreated me
and I've never wanted to leave him. How could I leave
him now he is blind and weak? He wasn't like that when
I came to him. Just as a husband would care for his sick
wife, she must care for him.
And what about your daughter?
She's not married yet. The man she's living with hasn't
come to make the traditional salutations, and we don't
mind waiting. Because once he comes, and we accept
his gifts, the girl will no longer be so free to leave him.
As things are now, she can leave whenever she likes,
with no problems.
Is it good to be your husband's
only wife ?
It is not for me to say. Some women think that to be
alone means hard work. But I'm lucky because I have
my "sisters" here and we help each other like co-wives.
We take turns at cooking and we eat together. Sometimes
I eat with my husband, but not when his friends visit him.
They would not be at ease and eat their fill if I were there.
When a man has many wives, he never eats with them.
I think I am happy to be with my husband.
Who work harder, men or women ?
We are old, my husband and me, so neither of us works
so hard any more. To keep busy, he makes ropes or
pretends to sew, washes his clothes or potters about in
my peanut fields close to the house. But mostly he just
stays around here and chats with our friends.
When he was younger, though, he worked very hard, .
and following traditional habit, he didn't want me to work
much in the fields. Some men don't want their wives to
work at all. Why, Avuyan's new wife doesn't even know
how to use a daba (short-handled hoe).
I always insisted on helping. When you see your
husband working so hard to feed his family, how can you
not go too? But there are other activities that women
cannot do, because they are really too weak like making
a lettuce patch or growing tomatoes. For that, you must
dig a well, and water the garden every day. It's the same
for cotton too much work for one woman alone.
Who decides which children, boys or
girls, will go to school?
My children didn't go to school. When they were the
right age to begin, we'd hardly even heard about such
things. But now my husband says it would be fine if
I learned how to read and write just so long as I stayed
at home and took care of him as I always do.
IfAVI DA Kayira, aged about 65, lives in her brother's
IVniirtrt household. While chatting with several older
women visitors, she sews together a sarro (straw mat)
with an iron needle and leather strips. The younger
women show interest in our questions, but maintain a
respectful silence while she answers.
How does a girl get a husband?
My father found me my husband. I was married first
with a man who courted me in a way that wins young girls,
but he was very poor. After I bore him a son, he was
unable to pay my father the bride price, and even his
brothers couldn't help him, so my father took me back.
Later I married again, but my parents kept my son.
My second husband was a good man and I stayed witiV

'TIME-BUDGETS' OF AFRICAN
AND EUROPEAN WOMEN
The strip cartoons at right show how an African woman
(above) and a European woman (below) spend their day,
from getting up in the morning until putting their children
to bed, late in the evening. A comparison of the way
people spend their time (a "time-budget") may reveal more
about their lives than a study of the way they spend their
money. Not every kind of human activity is reflected
in income or expenditure, but everyone has exactly
24 hours or 1440 minutes a day at his or her disposal, and
how he or she uses it can be measured. Drawing on a study,
published by the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa ("Women of Africa, today and tomorrow," 1975),
cartoonist Alain Roussel has drawn these cartoons specially
for the "Unesco Courier".

k his only wife. But now that he is old, he can no longer
farm the land. We have no sons and no sons-in-law
to help us. We had nothing to eat, so I returned to live
here with my father.
Who decides which children, boys
or girls, will go to school?
The husband. It's natural that a woman should follow
her husband in all matters, get his food when he needs it,
bring him water, and always obey him.
Girls don't go to school. They must stay with their
mothers to help prepare the meals and fetch water. Then
they will become wives and mothers. When would they
have time for school? It is much more important that a girl
stay with her children. She's the one who suffers for them
in childbirth, who cleans them, and cares for them when
they are ill. The husband knows nothing of these things.
CATA Sata, about 40, is busy grilling millet. She has
Onln two sons and a daughter, all grown. She has
been to the nation's capital three times, twice with her
husband, and once to visit her brother who is a nurse
there. They are all Muslims.
How does a girl get a husband?
My father chose mine, but it is my husband's sister
Azanga who tells my daughters what to do. It is because
she became a rich merchant in Ghana and could afford
to give many horses and fine clothes to her brothers. She
has no children of her own so she claims all her rightc
in the family.
She took my daughter away when she was just a girl.
That frequently happens here but it's not like getting
married. It just becomes the older "sister's" responsibility
to find the girl a husband later on.
Why do people divorce ?
I have been with my husband since we married many
years ago. But once I went back to my father's house
to stay for a long while during all the growing season.
I was much younger. My husband took a new wife which
is only right, but then he gave her millet to sell for him
in the market the millet I had helped to plant and harvest.
The older women here came to whisper in my ear that
it was unjust, but I couldn't complain, so I simply took my
new-born child and went back to my father's house. My
husband apologised correctly, sending friends with presents
for me and my father. I came back, but you can be sure,
I waited until all the work had been finished for that
season, so that my new co-wife would know what it was
to work hard and alone.
Who decides which children will
go to school?
The man decides. The wife takes no decisions where
the children are concerned. It is easier to send boys to
school than girls because for girls you have to get the
permission of the aunts as well as that of the father. Also,
you can't count on a girl to finish school because as soon

as she marries, her husband makes her stop. He knows
an educated woman would not accept to stay with a simple
farmer husband.
CONCLUSION To draw a coherent conclusion from the
ideas of these six people we should
keep two things in mind. Firstly, rural life is based on
traditions that change; and secondly, due to the influence
of traditional ideals, there is often a discrepancy between
what people say happens and what actually occurs.
Kayira gives us a fair picture of the ideas and values
concerning women fifty years ago. A girl first of all
obeyed her father (she married, divorced, and even relin¬
quished her child according to his orders), and then her
husband whom she "followed in all matters". Girls did
not look after animals or have "important" family responsi¬
bilities, nor did they go to school.
Bit by bit, we see these ideas changing: in Kawe who
recognizes that her daughter will probably choose her
own husband, in Pauline who thinks boys and girls do more
or less the same work, and in Avuyan who believes it is
just as good to educate girls as boys.
But if change seems to be working in favour of women
in certain areas, it may not be so positive in terms of
workloads. As Kassaana tells us, women traditionally did
relatively light work in the fields. Recently, however, it
has become accepted for wives to take on more of the
heavy duties in their husbands' fields and some are even
starting their own millet and cotton crops.
Hence, they do all the traditional jobs cooking, fetching
firewood and water, cleaning, caring for the children and
take an increasing part in farming responsibilities. The
traditional masculine realm of duties has not widened in
a corresponding manner.
No woman, not even of the new generation, would ever
say that anyone but her father chose her husband, nor,
in most cases, that she'd been married more than once.
Yet according to our informants, such things happen not
infrequently.
Other traditional values such as "business is for men,"
"girls don't go to school", and "boys don't help their
mothers" are also challenged by particular cases. Yet
most women still believe that men work harder than women,
because that is the accepted theory.
An explanation of these seeming contradictions is that
the interviews encompass not only traditional ideals, but
also the wider spectrum of tacitly accepted behaviour.
The differences between the people interviewed here
point out the difficulty one has in trying to generalize about
any society. The Kassena are only one of nearly a
hundred separate ethnic groups in Upper Volta, each of
which has its own traditions concerning women. Just
where a person fits in on this elastic scale of behaviour
depends very much on individual character and circum¬
stances. So in order to gain some insight about the life
of rural African women, one needs to maintain a completely
open mind, and take into account many different viewpoints.

"I'm afraid to go shopping," proclaims one of these spoon-shaped picket-signs brandished

Japanese women
raise the rice spoon
of revolt
by Michiko Inukai
WHEN in 1948 a Japanese
woman senator, Mumeo Oku,
chose a flat wooden rice spoon called
a Shamoji as the emblem of her newly
organized Union of Women (Shu-Fu-
Ren), few Japanese were surprised at
her choice. For most people it clearly
indicated what she wanted to achieve.
Ever since then huge picket signs
bearing the Shamoji emblem have
become a familiar sight to the Japa¬
nese public at demonstrations against
political corruption, price-fixing by big
business, or other economic scandals.
Throughout our history of some
2,000 years, the Shamoji has been
inseparably associated with something
of vital importance to all Japanese
rice. Rice not only formed the basic
diet of the people; until the end of the
19th century it was also a substitute
for money, playing a central role in
finance as gold does today. This
explains why in Japan rice-growers
were always esteemed more highly
than merchants or artisans.
Rice was also the finest of all
offerings one could make to the gods
who watched over Mizu-Ho-No-Kuni
MICHIKO INUKAI, Japanese author, has
twice won Japan's "Fu/in-Koron" literary prize.
A member of the Japanese Writers' Association,
she was the first woman to join the Prime
Minister of Japan's "Think Tank" (1965-1970).
(Land of Abundant Rice the ancient
name of Japan). It was the supreme
means of reconciling individuals and
classes: eating rice cooked in the
same pot meant sharing a single
offering, a single prayer, a single
source of life and in this way sym¬
bolized one brotherhood.
The Shamoji was the only utensil
which could be used to handle rice.
It became a symbol of participation
in the nation's economic and political
life, as well as representing the idea
of reconciliation and peace in Japa¬
nese society. And women had a pri¬
vileged role as keepers of the
Shamoji.
By choosing the Shamoji as its em¬
blem, Madame Oku's Union of Women
thus proclaimed that it was aiming to
reaffirm and strengthen the traditional
role of Japanese women in response
to the needs of the modern world.
The traveller who walks out of the
Yosuya Railway Station in Tokyo
cannot fail to notice a greyish six-
storey building on the opposite side
of the station square. From its summit
hangs an enormous sign bearing the
words Shu-Fu-Kaikan (Headquarters of
the Union of Women) in Japanese
characters. Since it was built in 1956
with donations from about one million
women from all over Japan, this modest
building has been a source of conster¬
nation to big business monopolies and
a place where popular causes have
always found a hearing.
In the entrance hall hangs a huge
placard bearing the union's declar¬
ation: "This is the headquarters of the
associated union of all the women
and of various women's organizations
whose aims are: 1) to enable every
woman to develop her talents and
interests to the full; 2) to establish
real and lasting peace and equality
in society through a fair distribution
of goods; 3) to promote better eco¬
nomic and political development In
society through the use of reason,
not power".
All this may seem rather idealistic,
but in fact the. union's activities are
very much down-to-earth. Every day
the headquarters receives telephone
calls and letters from hundreds of the
union's million members, who unfail¬
ingly report any new developments
social, political or economic which
may be against the public interest.
One member may notify head¬
quarters of a sudden rise in the price
of soja sauce' (an indispensable item
in Japanese cooking). Another may
report that a factory manufacturing
dangerous chemicals is to be built
near a kindergarten. Information of
this kind is first of all sorted out at
headquarters and then if the union
considers that it is sufficiently impor¬
tant for action, it forms an emergency
committee to investigate the matter
and fight if necessary.
For these women with their spoons
are fighters to be reckoned with. Once
they set out to get to the bottom of
a question, the investigation com¬
mittees never let up until they have
got a satisfactory answer.
Three years ago, for example, after
a long inquiry and a fierce tussle with
one of Japan's biggest industries, the
union won a 30 per cent price cut in
colour television sets, to universal
applause.
One of the union's strongpoints is
that its members include women
specialists in many different fields,
whose expertise the union can call on
at any time.
The union's big fight in 1975 is being'^

f1 waged against a powerful chemical
company whose cosmetics, the union
believes, contain too many dangerous
chemicals, as well as being overpriced.
To the company's horror, the union
has ordered a general boycott of its
products.
The union also has its own labora¬
tory for chemical analysis, again
thanks to permanent collaboration by
its own chemists, doctors and other
scientific experts, where new synthetic
products and foods are tested to find
out whether or not they contravene
current laws or regulations on such
products.
The union has long waged an anti¬
pollution campaign. True Shamoji
holders cannot ignore this modern
enemy of peace and health. Last
year, groups were formed to examine
the "quality of the air" in various areas
of Tokyo. The results of their investi¬
gations were sent to the Ministry of
Health, with a strongly-worded demand
that anti-pollution policy should be
stepped up.
Many Shamoji members have seats
In the Japanese Parliament or in local
assemblies. Some members who are
economists sit on Japan's National
Price Control Committee, and are thus
always available to make a political
issue out of rising prices. Whenever
they think it necessary, the union's
executive members ask for a half-hour
(or even an hour) interview with the
Prime Minister or the Finance Minister
on a nation-wide television network.
To turn down such a request would be
to guarantee a mass demonstration of
women with their spoons.
The Shamoji women may be comba¬
tive, but they do not simply fight for
fighting's sake. They keep themselves
fully Informed on all the economic,
political and social problems of Japan
today, and when they fight it is with
the idea of achieving better solutions
to these problems.
Since 1949 a summer university
session has been organized at union
headquarters to give non-specialist
members a better understanding
of current events through lectures
by leading Japanese educators and
specialists.
The union's interests are not limited
to Japan's domestic problems. It has
an international relations office where
current reports from overseas on such
questions as the status of women,
environment policy, the problems of
world hunger, etc., are assembled. Last
year the international relations section
sent a group of its members to the
People's Republic of China to study
the conditions of women workers.
The union also has its own hotel for
members and visitors, its own monthly
paper, its own adult education centre
and its own nation-wide chain-store
network. In most parts of Japan,
these are called "honest shops",
chosen, supported and sponsored by
the union. These shops, conspicuous
for the huge signs hanging on
their doors reading " Shu-Fu-No-Mise"
(authorized by the Shu-Fu-Ren) sell
a wide variety of reasonably priced,
good-quality products.
The remarkable thing about the Shu-
Fu-Ren is that though it defends the
cause of women, its horizons stretch
beyond feminism: it believes that one
cannot promote the welfare of women
without doing the same for men. This
is a viewpoint long rooted in the tra¬
ditions of Japan.
No discrimination between the sexes
existed in Japan until the end of the
11th century. Previously, women of
the wealthier classes were allowed by
law to possess "their own piece of
land" (usually rice-fields). Each
woman land-owner had to pay taxes.
Married or not, she had to make her
own income tax declaration bearing
her seal and signature.
In Japan, as in other agricultural
countries, women worked long and
hard on the land. Since they did half
the work in the rice-fields and fishing,
they were paid the same wages as men.
Until the 11th century, Japan had a
prosperous, stable society, as Japanese
literature testifies. The earliest Ja¬
panese poem to have survived was
written in the middle of the 4th century
and its author was a woman.
The 8th century saw the compilation
of the anthology of poems known as
Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand
Leaves). Among the works in this
classic anthology, which still holds a
powerful appeal for young Japanese
today, are a long poem by a girl
farmer, a lyric by a poor soldier's wife,
a passionate song by a princess, an
epic by a fisherwoman, a love poem
by an empress.
After these poems, Japanese roman¬
tic literature reached its apogee,
crowned by the immortal figure of Lady
Murasaki (978-1016), whose multi-
volume "Tale of Genji" has appeared
in Unesco's Literature Translation
series. (See "Unesco Courier", June
1957.)
But Japanese society was radically
transformed with the spectacular rise
of the Samurai (the warrior class),
whose struggle for power plunged
Japan into a turmoil which lasted until
the end of the 15th century.
The Samurai wanted to fight and
conquer and this was an affair of men,
not women. Inevitably the position
GOOD-BYE
TO THE
HOMEBODY
IMAGE
The traditional image
of Japanese women as
little homebodies is
fading fast. Modern
Japan has a steadily
rising number of work¬
ing wives and mothers,
although many big em¬
ployers consider mar¬
riage incompatible
with real commitment
to a job. Japan's Labour
Law carefully defines
the status of women
workers, governing
their hours of work
and holidays and pro¬
hibiting their employ¬
ment in dangerous or
harmful jobs. Here

mothers carry their
babies piggyback as

a provincial town.
formerly enjoyed by women began to
deteriorate, and it was not long before
they lost their right to own land and
their equal status in the eyes of the law.
During the dominance of the Sa¬
murai, only one thing counted: the
power of one man over another. The
feudal Samurai lord commanding 1,000
men wanted to lord it over 2,000; a
Samurai with one son wanted two.
And so women of the Samurai class
soon came to be regarded simply as
a means of "providing more men".
Yet in place of what they had lost,
women of the Samurai class gained
a new status as mothers, provided they
were lucky enough to give birth to
sons. Motherhood and all the rights
that came with it gave these women
authority not only over their sons but
over the entire household.
For the lower classes, however,
things were somewhat different.
The harsh demands of daily life
meant that anyone, man or woman,
who worked hard and well was highly
esteemed as a person in his or her
own right. Chronicles of various
Japanese villages reveal that women,
in fact, were often the family bread-

winners and thus had an influential
say in local community decisions.
In the 17th century, Japan's long era
of internal strife finally ended and
a rich merchant class began to emerge.
In flourishing centres of commerce
such as Osaka and Sakai, many
remarkable women rose to prominence
in business. In these towns even
today the tradition of giving able
women an opportunity to run busi¬
nesses is still maintained.
It is a myth that Japanese women
only achieved emancipation after World
War II. Long before 1945 they were
active in every field of Japanese life
in social work, teaching, literature,
economics, politics and the law.
The way was opened to them in
1869 by a law setting up Japan's
modern education system. Over
53,000 elementary schools and 256
secondary schools were set up; by
1872 half of the country's school¬
children were girls and Japan's illiter¬
acy rate had dropped to less than
5 per cent.
Although women were not able to
study at state universities until after
World War II, private universities were
opened to them at the beginning of
the 20th century, enabling a large
number of women to train for the
professions.
Japanese women also became active
in the fight for social justice. In 1886
girl textile workers launched Japan's
first strike in support of improved
working conditions. And it was a
group of women workers in northern
Japan who in 1918 organized the first
demonstration against current govern¬
ment price policies.
Between 1900 and 1920 many
Japanese women writers whose works
are now considered as classics were
associated with the movement against
Fascism and militarism. They were
not afraid to risk persecution and
torture at the hands of the police,
believing that "the pen is mightier than
the sword" and that it was their duty
to work for national and international
peace.
The appearance of many women's
magazines is another aspect of
women's literary achievement in 20th-
century Japan. The most outstanding
of these publications was "Fujin-
Koron" (Central Review for Women),
first published in 1915, which became
the standard-bearer of freedom, eman¬
cipation, equality and peace for all.
Its small group of regular women
contributors, led by Madame Raicho
Hiratsuka, a member of the famous
Sei-to-sha (Blue stocking women)
group exerted a remarkable influence
on Japanese thought at that time. One
of these talented writers was a young
woman named Mumeo Oku, the future
founder of Shu-Fu-Ren, the union of
the spoons.

AFTER
THE TRAGEDY
OF MINAMATA
Blind and dumb from birth, Tomoko Uemura (above) is a tragic victim of Minamata Disease,
which struck the inhabitants of a fishing village on Japan's Minamata Bay (below)
in the late 1950s. The disease, which killed 100 persons and poisoned hundreds more,
was caused by eating fish contaminated by mercury waste from the Chisso Corporation's
plant, which had polluted the waters of the bay. Women's organizations have been in
the forefront of campaigns that have won compensation for the victims. Below right, the
acting president of the Chisso Corporation expresses his regrets in the home of

The crusade
of Japan's women
against the ravages
of pollution

MATSUI YAYORI, Japanese writer and jour¬
nalist, ¡s a leading figure in Japan's women's
liberation movement. She currently writes for
the Tokyo daily "Asahi Shimbun." specializing
in the question of women's rights as well as
problems of the environment, social welfare
and the consumer movement. Her article is
adapted from a special study published In
"Japan Quarterly" magazine (January-March
1975).
TO most foreigners, the prevailing
image of the Japanese woman
must be that of a subservient wife and
protective mother, shy and gentle,
wearing her kimono elegantly, and
gracefully enjoying the arts of the tea
ceremony and of flower arrangement.
The role of the Japanese woman has
traditionally been fixed as that of a
housekeeper.
So it is remarkable that an increasing
number of Japanese women have begun
to make efforts to break out of their
traditional life-style of subjugation.
In fact, recent years have witnessed
a powerful explosion of Japanese
women's long pent-up energies, which
has shaken some aspects of Japanese
society. Those newly awakened ener¬
gies have been chiefly directed into
movements either opposing environ¬
mental pollution or supporting the
protection of consumers' rights.
One tragic occurrence, symbolic of
Japan's worsening environmental pol¬
lution, was the outbreak of Minamata
Disease, which claimed a hundred lives
and inflicted organic mercury poisoning
on several hundred (see "Unesco
Courier", July 1971).
The tragedy occurred in a small
fishing village in Minamata Bay,
towards the end of the 1950s.
Japanese scientists discovered that
Minamata Disease was caused by
waste from the Chisso Corporation's
plant, located in Minamata City, which
had polluted not only the coastal
waters but also fish and shellfish.
Women who had eaten the polluted
fish and shellfish gave birth to babies
who were paralyzed or blind and dumb.
Victims of this terrible disease were
poverty-stricken fishermen in no pos¬
ition to press claims against the huge
industrial enterprise that dominated the
Minamata district.
But there was one woman visitor to
this fishing village who called at the
homes of these pitiful victims. She
was Ishimure Michiko, a poet and
housewife. She kept records of all
she saw and heard during her visits.
In a spirit of profound sympathy and
understanding, Ishimure Michiko wrote
a documentary account, entitled "Our
Minamata Disease", in 1969.
This book brought home vividly to
the Japanese people the effects of
industrialization and sparked off an
enormous reaction. The book frankly
and convincingly questioned the "pro¬
ductivity and profit-first" attitude of
industrialized Japan.
Ishimure Michiko herself organized
a civic group to assist victims of
Minamata Disease and launched a
movement to secure adequate com¬
pensation for them from the Chisso
Corporation.
The Kumamoto District Court ruled
in the spring of 1973 that the Chisso
Corporation should pay compensation
to the victims and their families.
In 1964, a disease called the Second
Minamata Disease broke out among
more than 200 persons living along the
banks of the Agano River in Niigata
Prefecture on Honshu, Japan's largest
island. Ten persons died. The dis¬
ease was caused by the waste water
from the Shôwa Denkô K. K. chemical
plant.
But the chemical firm rejected any
responsibility for the organic mercury
poisoning, and so the victims filed a
lawsuit against the firm. The court
finally ruled that Shôwa Denkô K. K.
was responsible for the waste water
which had polluted the river and .
caused the disease.

k The
voiced
first accusations had been
by three young women em¬
ployees of Shôwa Denkô, who attacked
their company's irresponsible attitude
toward environmental pollution. At
that time, trade unionists were un¬
critical of the firm's policy and
continued to take what they called
a "neutral" stand in respect of this
Second Minamata Disease.
It had become taboo for company
employees to discuss the problem of
pollution, and the workers pretended
to know nothing about the disease and
its victims. Infuriated by such an
attitude of indifference, three young
girls planned to stage a demonstration
for the victims in front of the firm's
head office.
Finally some ten women workers
carried out their plan. "Don't shut
your eyes to environmental pollution.
Workers and victims should be united",
they declared. Three women who
took part in the demonstration had
their rights as trade unionists sus¬
pended for alleged violation of union
regulations.
They went to Niigata to see the
victims and to find out the truth for
themselves. They returned determined
to win the fight. They reproduced and
distributed pamphlets to inform people
about the pitiful plight of the victims
and to reveal the truth.
It required much courage and deter¬
mination to make such a bold appeal
at that time. The accusation of the
three young women made a strong
impression upon public opinion in
Japan, where employees have seldom
criticized their employers' business
policies.
Since 1972, the emphasis within
movements against environmental pol¬
lution has shifted from efforts to secure
adequate compensation for damage or
injury to campaigns to halt the building
of factories and power plants that could
cause pollution. In this new type of
movement, Japanese women have
played a leading role.
They have also been active in the
consumer movement, with women from
the cities taking the lead. Japanese
women have also taken a significant
part in bringing about changes in Ja¬
pan's politics and society. The popu¬
lar movements led by women are
motivating and directing a new demo¬
cratic trend in Japan.
Japanese women are slowly but
steadily changing, and we may soon
expect that the country will rid itself
of its reputation as a society in which
women are treated as inferior to men.

OF THE LAW - HUBBY

Since March 8, 1975, a law
adopted in Cuba obliges husbands
to help their wives with housework

Women have played a major part in Cuba's nation-wide campaigns to improve literacy, education
and health, while also making an important contribution to the country's economic development.
Many of their rights are now clearly established in Cuba's Family Code which, in reappraising
responsibilities in the home, requires men to share in housework and care of the children.
A church council meeting in
Rome in the 16th century came
to the conclusion that the Indians
encountered by Columbus in the New
World did, after all, have souls. About
the same time in France, Montaigne
recounted that the nuns in a certain
convent had one day made the start¬
ling discovery that a peasant was a
man.
Today Latin Americans are becoming
aware of the fact that women are
human beings (though when one thinks
of the favoured treatment given to
animals in some places, one might
well ask what real benefits this has
brought them).
In Cuba, which is from many points
of view an exception on the map of the
Americas, women are treated like
human beings.
But whatever Cuban women have
won thus far has not come to them on
a plate, as a gift from the powers-
that-be. History gave them no time
to engage in theoretical discussions
JORGE ENRIQUE ADOUM, Ecuadorian poet and writer, was formerly
National Director of Culture In Ecuador. For several years he collaborated
in Unesco's studies on Latin American cultures. He has made
many visits to Cuba and was there most recently early in 1975
as a member of the jury of the annual literary competition held by the
House of the Americas, in Havana. An anthology of his poems, "Informe
personnal sobre la situación" (Personal report on the situation) has just
been published in Havana. He is now a member of the editorial staff
of the "Unesco Courier."
about equality. On the contrary, they
became aware of their rights day by
day as they fought to change their
society, in a struggle culminating in
the victory of January 1, 1959, a
struggle in which many of them be¬
came heroines and martyrs.
Of the 270,000 volunteers in the
great Literacy Corps which reduced
illiteracy in Cuba from 23 per cent
to 3.7 per cent in one year, some
60 per cent were women. Similarly,
women have helped to retrain dom¬
estic servants for productive work, to
establish nursery schools, to carry out
vaccination campaigns and other public
health measures.
They have also co-operated in the
elimination of prostitution, not by
repressive measures but through
education and by making available jobs^

towns, to prevent the past from being
an obstacle to the incorporation of
these women in the new society.
Today in Cuba women are "in
transition" on the road to equality. By
1970, girls accounted for 49 per cent
of children In elementary schools,
55 per cent of those in secondary
schools, and 40.6 per cent of students
in higher education.
Prior to 1959 Cuba's 194,000 women
workers 70,000 of them domestic
servants represented only 9 per cent
of the country's total labour force. By
1974 the figure had reached 590,000,
or more than 25 per cent of all
workers, thereby freeing a large seg¬
ment of manpower for other occu¬
pations, such as sugar-cane harvesting.
Cuban women considered they had
won a victory when a provision stating
that every business enterprise should
reserve a certain number of posts "for
women" was removed from the Labour
Code. Today women are even work¬
ing in the docks and on building sites,
doing jobs which were traditionally
men's.
Whereas scarcely 20 per cent of
Cuban women could afford hospital
and clinical services before 1959,
today 95 per cent benefit from them.
This has reduced the death-rates of
babies and deaths in childbirth in
Cuba to the lowest levels in Latin
America. Death-rates of babies in
other Latin American countries are
sometimes as high as 150 or 200 per
1,000, but in Cuba only 26 babies died
for every 1,000 births in 1973 and
fewer than six mothers out of every
10,000 died in childbirth.
Nevertheless, just as everywhere
else in the world, Cuban women have
been, as it were, an occupied terri¬
tory, and liberation has not brought
instant emancipation from the colon¬
ized mentality, and still less from the
occupying power, the male.
At the closing session of the Second
Congress of the Federation of Cuban
Women, in November 1974, Prime
Minister Fidel Castro referred to the
fact that "(after more than fifteen years
of revolution)... there are still objective
and subjective factors that result in
discrimination against women."
Fidel Castro explained what struc¬
tural changes would be made by the
State in Cuba's next five-year plan to
attack various forms of discrimination.
Such measures include the construc¬
tion of 400 nursery schools (in addition
to those being built by volunteer
groups) with facilities for 150,000 chil¬
dren (three times the present number);
400 dey-boarding schools, which will
increase the present number of pupils
by 120,000; no fewer than 1,000
secondary schools, with places for
more than half a million rural students
who are now receiving scholarships;
special schools with 4,000 places for
children with learning problems; 49 new
hospitals, 110 polyclinics, 19 clinics,
51 homes for old people and 16 homes
for the disabled.
Referring to the need for a funda¬
mental change in attitude, he added:
"We still have to ask ourselves when
will we eradicate the age-old ways of
thinking, when will we overcome all
those prejudices?" And he declared,
"...when the objective of national
liberation is finally attained, women
will still need to continue the fight for
their own liberation in human society."
Following the proclamation of Inter¬
national Women's Year, and even
before, some of women's claims to
equality were immediately and uni¬
versally acknowledged (almost as
though no thought had been given to
the sweeping economic and social
reforms they imply).
But no matter how reasonable such
legal or political changes may be, they
can never be fully effective if they are
considered in isolation from the
general context of a country. This is
proved by the vigorous struggle that
usually has to be waged before a
principle, such as "equal pay for equal
work" or "men and women are equal
before the law", is actually put Into
practice.
It is open to question, for example,
whether the mere exercise of the right
to vote, which Ecuadorian women have
enjoyed since 1929, has brought them
a more favourable social situation than
that of Paraguayan women who have
only been voting since 1961. Or
whether Uruguayan women, who can
divorce without having to prove any¬
thing whereas their husbands must
establish grounds for divorce are
better off than women in Argentina
where there is no divorce.
Cuba has made it clear that "the
struggle for the equality of women is
not only the task of women but of
society as a whole," in other words,
that an out-and-out battle must be
waged against the ideology of the
occupying male.
This ideology finds its ultimate
expression in the reaction of the
Indian woman whose husband was
striking her. When someone inter¬
vened and tried to defend her, she
turned on her would-be rescuer and
cried: "But he's my husband, so he
may beat mel"
A century ago, Engels claimed that
monogamie marriage is a repro¬
duction in miniature of relations in
society, the husband corresponding to
the oppressor and the wife to the
oppressed class.
Since then, however, changes have
taken place in some societies. (In
some marriages as well: "There was
a man who beat his wife when he was
drunk and who was beaten by her the
rest of the time" is not only the
beginning of a short story but the
epitome of a situation which, though
infrequent, is none the less true to
life.)
Male supremacy in its extreme form
is known as "machismo" and is
attributed to Latin Americans as if it
were, an exclusive legacy from
ancient times, or something inherited
from Hispanic tradition. Its remote
origins are surely to be found In the
economic dependence that has always
been woman's lot, first under her
father (who at least considers it a
moral and legal duty to provide for
her), and subsequently under her
husband (who often hands her money
as if he were giving alms, disdain¬
fully like a millionaire or grudgingly
like a poor man).
But when women are economically
independent, as they are in Cuba, the
-die-hards who still defend the old
way of life turn to biological argu¬
ments, such as the weakness and
timidity of women (even though they
serve as soldiers and paratroopers),
or to historical arguments, such as
their supposedly greater aptitude for
housework than for creative activities
(though it now appears that both
sexes are equally capable of both
types of work), or even to some
distant justification taken from the
bible to the effect that woman was
created to be man's companion (in
which case man should automatically
become woman's companion).
Cuban men, like all other men, have
been accustomed to make a distinction
between Woman, as idealized in life
and literature, and woman spelt with a
small "w". Woman with a capital "W"
is the archetype of tenderness and
moral perfection if she is a mother,
and if she is a fiancée she is the
archetype of beauty as well. On the
other hand, woman, the wife, is stripped
of her capital "W", along with all the
qualities once extolled in her, all her
rights, and even her family name.
Latin Americans have been carica-
turized as sex overlords, and what is
worse we have accepted this image,
which portrays us as keeping our sub-r
A young mother anxiously waits for her

in Latin America, motherhood and the
raising of children bring problems whose
harsh reality contrasts sharply with
the idealized image of a mother

missive little wives huddled and trem¬
bling in a corner, preferably in the
kitchen, waiting for us to come home.
Yet paradoxically we break into
tears in our love songs, be they from
Mexico, Cuba, Argentina or Brazil,
over the Woman who has jilted us
heartlessly or because unkind fate has
willed it. When we squarely face the
fact that she left us for another man,
we insult her, but since we were not
yet married to her, we do so in verse
and to music.
As for woman with a small "w", she
only rarely finds a place in our songs,
such as the one that runs: "Victory,
victory I am in paradise, My wife has
gone." On the other hand, she is the
favourite target, along with mothers-
in-law, alcoholics, the mentally sick,
etc., of jokes and stories that women
themselves sometimes repeat blithely
and at others listen to with a sad
smile of resignation.
Such an. attitude is still prevalent in
Cuba, though the radio and television,
as well as cartoonists, are now being
encouraged to desist from this often
vicious type of humour which is either
an import or a throwback to the past.
The survival of this feeling of superi¬
ority in men coincides with an un¬
conscious acceptance of that superi¬
ority by women. In Cuba, in the
province of Matanzas, the number of
women candidates standing for elec¬
tion to the Poderes Populares (the
bodies through which government is
decentralized and which function at
the level of the city block, the neigh¬
bourhood, town, city and province)
was only 7.6 per cent of the total, and
a mere 3 per cent were elected, even
though women make up half the
population of the province.
Prime Minister Fidel Castro, in
stressing the fact that these figures
should be of concern to all Cubans,
added: "The day will have to come
when we have a Party of men and
women, a Leadership of men and
women, a State of men and women,
and a Government of men and women."
On the other hand, some men raised
objections to Cuba's Family Code in
the discussions that took place in the
various organizations of workers,
farmers, women and students through¬
out the country. This legal document,
which was promulgated on March 8,
1975, is perhaps the fairest and most
human legislation in the world govern¬
ing relations in the home.
The article that aroused the most
heated discussions was the one which
lays down that the husband and wife
must contribute to meeting the needs
of the family. . . each one according to
his abilities and his economic capacity.
Nevertheless, if one of the spouses
only contributes to that subsistence
through housework and care of the
children, the other should contribute
[financially] ... by himself alone, but
without being exempted from sharing
in the housework and care of the
children.
In her book La Mujer Cubana Ahora
("Cuban Women Now"), published in
Havana by the Instituto Cubano del
Libro in 1975, Margaret Randall, a
North American writer who lives in
Cuba, examines the interviews that
she carried out over a three-year
period. She makes a fair analysis of
the current situation, after which she
recounts some of the arguments she
heard presented when the bill was
being discussed at all levels of the
population before being passed.
"During a lively debate in which
both sexes took part, one woman
stood up and shouted: 'If they are
going to incorporate us in the labour
force, they will have to incorporate
themselves in the home, and there is
no more to be said!' " She was given
a standing ovation.
Other women stated that they did
not really expect the older men to
change. "One woman said: The
women around here drafted this law
before the Government even thought
of it . . . and there is nothing for the
young men to do now but accept itl' "
Such a re-appraisal of housework
and insistence on its being shared
frees woman from her status as head
servant in the home or as someone
supported by her husband. Formerly if
a young man earning a good salary
married a teacher or a nurse, for
example, he thought it unnecessary for
her to work, and thus the country lost
the services of a teacher or nurse.
Young men also used to object to
their fiancee's being involved in
political activities "because it was
obvious that such participation re¬
leased women from the direct control
which society had taught men to want
and to demand" (M. Randall).
These prejudices have been neutral¬
ized by Article 28 of the Code which
stipulates: "Both spouses shall have
the right to practise their professions
or trades and shall have an obligation
to show consideration and be helpful
to one another in that respect, and
also as regards studies or the improve¬
ment of their knowledge. . .". And it
adds, with a true sense of realism:
". . . but they shall in any case strive
to organize life in the home in such a
way that these activities are co¬
ordinated with the fulfilment of the
obligations that this Code lays upon
them."
Divorce no longer depends upon
the usual grounds required in other
Latin American countries, such as
"adultery" which in most of them is
only deemed a transgression when
committed by the woman or "mental
cruelty" or "abandonment of the
home".
Indeed, in some countries divorce
for adultery requires the testimony of
eye-witnesses, which, for obvious
reasons, is almost impossible to
obtain. The Code allows other more
human reasons, such as "mutual
consent", and grounds that are more
just, such as "causes as a result of
which the marriage has lost its meaning
for the spouses and for the children,
and hence for society as well."
In a society that thus establishes
the bases of human dignity (in which
women have achieved economic
equality with men; children receive an
education that combines study and
work so that by the end of their
secondary schooling they have a good
grounding in a freely chosen occu¬
pation; a society in which money has
ceased to be a fetish and has once
again become the medium of exchange
that it originally was; and in which the
State provides medical care and
medicines and guarantees a serene old
age) the many dreary arguments that
are usually put forward in Latin
America as reasons for marriage all
fall by the wayside.
The sole valid motive that remains
the Cuban Code does not say as much
but it is obvious is love itself, or the
closest thing to it, even if it is
occasionally only a mirage.
Equality, Cuba's Prime Minister has
said, is not to be confused with a lack
of consideration. And he adds: "If
there are to be any privileges in human
society, if there are to be any in¬
equalities in human society, then these
must be small privileges and small
inequalities in favour of women"...
"because women have tasks and
functions and human responsibilities
that the man does not have."
This applies with even more rel¬
evance to those Latin American
societies which are so full of privileges
and inequalities that have never been
in women's favour.
We may know or we may search
for the reasons for this situation and
we may even be aware where the
responsibilities lie. But one thing is
certain: since it is impossible to
conceive of man's happiness indepen¬
dently of woman's, the tragic and
shameful practice of discrimination is
a game in which all of us are losers.

. But for centuries it has remained silent
on the subject of its women.
Today, as we embark on the conquest
of space, the pioneers of Muslim
feminism are boldly demanding the
right to venture outside the confines
of their homes and look at last upon
their fellow beings before lifting their
eyes to the stars. Men have already
travelled to the moon but to this day
most of the houses lining the traditional
Arab streets are windowless; in order
that women shall remain invisible, they
are still deprived of sight.
, But one cannot attempt to define the
Muslim woman without first defining
the Muslim man.
Is the Muslim the same today in
Morocco as he is in Pakistan, for
example? Let us be quite clear that
in speaking of the Muslim man, we
do not necessarily mean the devout
believer who, as he turns towards the
Kaaba in Mecca for the set prayers
five times a day, sheds his historical
and geographical heritage and is at
once immersed in the source of his
faith in the far off year 622, the date
of the Hegira; the devout Muslim,
whether in Constantine or Ispahan,
renounces the present and embraces
the eternal he bestrides the centuries
and exists beyond time.
But the Muslim who is simply
satisfied to be a passive member of
the Islamic community is open to the
full impact of political events and
developments: grandeur followed in
turn by decadence, lethargy, sub¬
jection and lastly the bloody and
chaotic upheavals of the slow awaken¬
ing. Af the end of such a road what
does a Muslim living in Mesopotamia
have in common with another in the
south of Hoggar?
Everywhere he is called with a
truth that transcends this fashionable
expression and journalistic tag a
"Man of the Third World". The
characteristics of this new community
are by now all too familiar: indepen¬
dence newly wrested from European
(and Christian?) colonialism dating
back to the last century or earlier;
an underlying economic paralysis and
social inflexibility (due to the partial
or total disappearance of the old
tribal society, the suffocation or
erosion of traditional village life);
the pre-eminence of politics eagerly
embraced as a community objective
and seen as a crucible of future
aspirations; and finally, a situation
which, in many cases, is a revolution¬
ary one or potentially so, because
ideas and attitudes which have served
for centuries are today unable to with¬
stand the shock of confrontation with
technological and industrial society.
Moreover, for young people who are
aware of and feel consciously involved
in the process of historical change
throughout the world, religion is losing
ground as a collective fact of life. The
faith of Islam, conceived in the sands
of Arabia as a pure entity embracing
the whole of life (encompassing prob¬
lems of hygiene, politics and diet as
well as metaphysics and woven into
a dense arabesque-like pattern) sud¬
denly seems to be enfeebled by this
narrowing of its scope.
Debilitation or reform, retreat or
renewal such is the dilemma which
Islam must resolve if it is to return
to its essence as a faith dwelling in
the individual consciousness, as an
evolving system of thought, as an
affirmation rather than a negation, as a
critical appraisal of time-honoured
habits.
The Muslim who is forced to come
to terms with concrete problems (the
brotherhood of the real New World
of the 20th century with its hordes
of beggars, its illiterate peasants, its
culturally uprooted intellectuals, its
military politicians and its political
militants the problems, in fact, of this
modern community which extends far
beyond the confines of the Islamic
crescent) whether he is overwhelmed
or inspired with new life, nevertheless

feels himself to be alone. He is iso¬
lated perhaps because he can no longer
regard his religion as an umbilical cord.
As his ties with tradition gradually
crumble away he feels that he is losing
for ever the innumerable small ways
in which he once asserted his identity.
Amid these shifting sands, there is
one reassuring point of stability, one
element which gives him inner coher¬
ence: his image of woman.
Every Muslim more or less con¬
sciously views the woman of his
dreams whether as sister, wife or
loved one in one particular guise,
that of the "Umm", the "Mamma" of
Mediterranean countries. She, unlike
the Father too often bereft of his
former prestige by collective defeat
has retained an unchallenged authority
in the eyes of the westernized intel¬
lectual, the traditionally minded, but
nowadays ill-at-ease, middle-class
citizen, or the countryman newly
transplanted to the city.
The Tribe is no more than a memory,
the earth no longer feeds the members
of the patrilineal family; the old woman,
with her apparent serenity, a vigorous
archetypal mother figure, thus stands
like a living image of the past to which
every masculine consciousness clings,
and increasingly so as this conscious¬
ness is undermined by ever new
aggressions.
Should one see the role which the
man of Islam assigns to women as
being a result of the strict prohibition
imposed by Islamic law on the inter¬
marriage of women with non-Muslims?
Throughout the period when the
Muslim world was under Western
colonial domination (in the East, the
Middle East, the Maghreb and else¬
where in Africa) no racially mixed
civilization emerged.
Admittedly, a mingling of races,
which in all ages has been a source
of human progress, took place
within the crescent itself: between
Berbers, Persians, Arabs, Turks,
Spanish Muslims and others. Never¬
theless, although a foreigner in Islam
is entitled, as a guest, to every mark
of hospitality, he may choose a wife
only on one condition: that he
renounce his original faïTîi. Once he
has embraced the faith of Islam all
roads become open to him and he is
free to marry.
But no historical or sociological
explanations can now prevent the
woman of Islam from thinking of herself
as an individual in her own right.
Having for so long been secluded,
apparently more on account of the
anguish of fathers, brothers and hus¬
bands than as an act of high-handed
and arbitrary masculine authority, she
nevertheless feels more and more that
she has been unjustly "consigned to
the shadows". Now, suddenly, she
finds herself in the spotlight, and the
ancestral ¡mage crumbles; the picture
loses its definition before the sharp
outlines of reality emerge.
The image of woman which is
preached, as a cautionary ¡deal, by
intellectuals, politicians and moralists
in the Muslim world now carries little
weight. The proletarian woman, worn
out by continual childbearing, who for
centuries has always borne the brunt
of the exploitation of labour, is assailed
by the modern world; new economic
needs are increasingly thrusting towns-
women, widows or divorced women in
the cities and ardent intellectuals into
occupations outside the home.
Political strife and bloody wars like
the recent struggle in Algeria or the
continuing conflict in Palestine, have
not merely thrust into the limelight
countless heroines, celebrated or
anonymous; they have given millions
of women the opportunity to shoulder
everyday material responsibilities either
as individuals or within the now un¬
settled traditional family.
Certain countries such as Tunisia
have made changes in their laws to
demonstrate that the Coranic law is
not immutable and absolute but that
it Implies in the first place, an effort
("ijtihad") to reach a new spirit of
liberal interpretation.
Today, more than ever before, the
continued existence of two separate
worlds In Islam seems an anachronism:
according to the traditional ethic, the
two parallel planes masculine and
feminine, external and internal each
had its own momentum and the re¬
lationship between the two was
governed by codes of rules which
remained unchallenged by either side:
with the wisdom of hindsight one may
debate whether this equilibrium was
necessary, but it remained an Inescap¬
able fact.
The causes of tensions and conflicts
lay elsewhere: in confrontations be¬
tween different social classes, national¬
ities or regions, or between those who
held power.
The world of women, overshadowed
both socially and politically, was
affected indirectly by all that went
on although, alas, no written testi¬
mony of this has survived; women's
role reasserted itself (and, in a sense,
took its revenge) in the sphere of the
growing consciousness, education,
sensibility, the "quality of life" here
it was in advance of the masculine
world.

The veil drops
in Afghanistan
She has come far, this young Afghan professor of history,
lecturing at the University of Kabul to a respectful and
attentive class of students (below right). For until recently,
motherhood, domestic chores or work on the land were
almost the only occupations of Afghanistan's women. But
this university professor belongs to today's avant-garde of
women for whom educational and job opportunities have
opened up : the 160,000 of the country's eight million women
who, in the cities, and unveiled, attend co-educational uni¬
versity classes, study to be doctors or do skilled jobs in
public services or private firms. These women can also
press their claims for equal rights through the Democratic
Organization of Afghan Women, led by its energetic president
(photo right). A move for women's emancipation in Afgha¬
nistan was made about 1930 by King Amanullah when he
abolished the "chadri", the traditional heavy veil. In 1959
members of the royal family and the government appeared
at a public ceremony accompanied by their unveiled wives
and daughters. Many women, however, still wear the
"chadri", although wives of farmers at their unending labour
in the fields discard it. Ninety per cent of Afghanistan's
15 million people are villagers, most of whom live in the
mountains, like this woman in the province of Nuristan
(left) carrying heavy goatskin sacks of corn, or the
Hazajarat family (below left) whose one-room home is
lit by a single ray of sunlight coming from a hole in the ceiling.
During the winter, the women and children are cloistered in
the silent villages while the menfolk are away working in
the towns. How many of these women are aware that only
a few hundred kilometres away, in Kabul,others are campaign¬
ing for reforms that would help to ease their lives?

. So much for the past. Today in
other words in the course of at least
the past fifty years two generations
of women have discovered that,
although the ferment of social conflict
denotes an awakening, and thus a kind
of progress, women can no longer be
content to play a subsidiary role (as
wives, mothers or sisters never
being considered as individuals in
their own right) and to be swept along
by the headlong advance of society.
The modern family with its new
structures the restricted family of
father, mother and children is the
seat of new conflicts: women in
general not all of whom are femin¬
ists are conscious of the fact that
the Muslim man, however revolution¬
ary he may be within his own union
or party or in discharging his civic
responsibilities, all too often clings in
his domestic life to the old ways.
When a modern Muslim couple is
alone (whether the partners are
intellectuals, 'an industrial worker and
his wife, a fellah and his wife who
labours with him in the fields, or an
unemployed townsman and his wife
who works both in and outside the
home) the woman is still expected to
submit passively to the weakened and
ineffective authoritarianism of the hus¬
band: a passivity concealed in such
imposed social stereotypes as women's
"goodness", "meekness", "modesty"
or "femininity".
Indeed, Muslim women are all too
often silent, and they appear to be so
all the time. The assumption, some¬
times overstated, that they exercise
a measure of authority behind the
scenes is small consolation and one
which is generally offered to oppressed
minorities.
Women themselves, their children
and the entire community would benefit
if women spoke out plainly on this
issue and came to terms with it but
centuries of traditional feminine reti¬
cence are against them. Any cour¬
ageous attempt by women to criticize
meets with a prompt response by
Muslim men who, unlike those in
Western bourgeois societies, are un¬
willing to mitigate the force of future
women's demands by adopting an
attitude of male reformism and pa¬
ternalism, such as one finds in Europe
today.
For the Muslim woman, therefore,
the outlook is all the more constricted
because of the lingering memory of
the Arab horizons of bygone days the
freedom of the desert, the intoxication
of warlike fantasias, the refinement of
the Andalusian courts of love.
All the tensions and frictions which
have succeeded each other during the
past hundred years in Europe as the
situation of women gradually improved
are to be found simultaneously within
the typical urban Muslim family today.
The Muslim family is becoming a
sort of kaleidoscope in which each
woman represents a stage of evolution:
the grandmother, or sometimes the
mother, has lived or still lives a
completely cloistered life; under the
same roof lives the teen-age girl, keen
on sport or politically committed, full
of youthful confidence as she pre¬
pares to embark on a life in which
she will accept and exercise personal
responsibilities.
Between these two extremes there
are sisters, aunts and cousins who, at
the stage of puberty or a little later,
were "shut in" and "veiled" as though
they were somehow incapacitated
and for whom this remains a painful
memory. Some of them are clearly
aware that they have paid the price
of the petty middle-class fears and
cowardice of fathers or elder brothers.
Any dialogue between the sexes is
therefore bound to be rendered more
difficult, as elsewhere in the world, by
feelings of bitterness and even rancour
on the part of women. Any expression
of optimism often seems little more
than rhetorical.
But what of the situation among
women themselves? In Islam, one
factor which makes a useful, tangible
contribution to any determined move¬
ment for their advancement is the
solidarity which exists among women
precisely because women exemplifying
different stages of emancipation live
in close proximity.
The grandmother, mindful of tra¬
ditional proprieties, may sometimes
disapprove of what she regards as her
grand-daughters' boldness, but this is
of small importance.
On the other hand, all women, at the
crucial stages of life education,
marriage, choice of job feel that they
are joining a long line of sacrificial
victims whose fate must inevitably
lead to the liberation of their suc¬
cessors.
It Is as though the young women
of Islam, in their inexorable advance,
feel themselves to be vicariously
reliving all the wasted lives of former
days.
This is the new harem, an almost
instinctive alliance welded together by
a singleness of purpose; when the
struggle to overcome material in¬
security and the exploitation by the
unemployed father or the working
brother harden the resolve of the
daughter in school or the sister in her
office job, the impetus of feminism
will be strengthened by a truly prolet¬
arian vigour.
What can be said of the future while
only insignificant and intermittent
progress is apparently being made but
when at the same time, an upsurge of
hope has already taken shape and is
seeking to make itself heard?
The future of Muslim society rests
on a new form of energy lying beneath
the surface: I am not making an
ironical reference to oil I am referring
to a real, even if sporadic awakening
of ideas among women. A new ethic
must be in the making if there is to
be any possibility of a modern Muslim
community. Assia D/ebar

The new feminist
explosion in the U.S.A,
SINCE the mid-1960s, a formidable
conglomeration of organizations,
programmes and manifestoes known
as the Women's Liberation Movement
has erupted in the United States with
extraordinary force. Dedicated to the
assertion of equal rights in all fields
work, education, law the movement
has grown at an astonishing rate, and
by now hundreds of thousands of
women have participated in at least
one of its groups or activities.
There have been mass demon¬
strations and energetic campaigns
directed at opening up a wider range
of life alternatives for women, and an
ardent struggle for the enactment of
the Equal Rights Amendment ("Equality
of rights under the law shall not be
denied or abridged by the United
States or. by any State on account of
sex.")
Finally passed by Congress in 1972,
after being introduced and ignored by
the federal legislature each year since
1923, this constitutional amendment is
still short by four states of the 38 re¬
quired to ratify it, but its progress to
this point represents a considerable
success by the liberationists.
In addition, there has been a flood
of books dealing with women's position
in society, and several new feminist
magazines have been launched. Most
prominent of these is Ms, which has
a circulation of 400,000 and covers the
political, cultural and personal concerns
of women.
The title is pronounced miz, a new
"liberated" form of address which
avoids identifying women on the basis
of their marital status (1). A more
recent entry Into the journalistic com¬
petition is womanSports, published by
tennis star Billie Jean King and her
husband.
The new movement has wielded
enormous political strength it has
intimidated male legislators, changed ^

iW laws, enjoyed increasing access to the
media. But impressive though its
impact has been, it is not really a new
phenomenon in American life.
Despite the feeling of many of its
participants that they are engaged in
a radical contemporary cause, the
feminist movement actually goes far
back in American history, to the early
19th century, when the "woman issue"
was extensively debated in the national
press, in political gatherings and from
church pulpits.
This early wave of feminism also
sprouted in a period of ferment
geographic expansion, industrial devel¬
opment and social reform. Its Initial
efforts were aimed at expanding
women's educational opportunities, and
in 1833 Oberlin (Ohio) became the
first college to open Its doors to both
men and women.
But it was in the abolitionist move¬
ment of the 1830s that the women's
rights movement as such had its
political origins. When women began
working in earnest for the abolition
of slavery, they learned that they could
not function as equals with their
male friends. They were barred from
membership in some organizations and
often forbidden to speak in public.
One hears the stark accents of
today's feminists in the sentiments
voiced by abolitionist Sarah Grimke
in 1837:
"All history attests that man has sub¬
jugated woman to his will as means
to promote his selfish gratification, to
minister to his sensual pleasures, to be
instrumental in promoting his comfort;
but never has he desired to elevate
her to the ranks she was created to
fill. He has done all he could to
debase and enslave her mind; and now
he looks triumphantly on the ruin he
has wrought and says the being he has
thus deeply injured is his inferior."
But while the battle for abolition
succeeded in emancipating the Negro
slaves, the concomitant demand for
women's rights did not have an equal
triumph. Feminist groups remained
active and sometimes militant in the
period following the American Civil
War of 1861-65, but it was not until
1920 that they won the fight for
women's suffrage. With that victory,
the feelings of injury abated, and femin¬
ism lay dormant for some 40 years.
What is it that has just this past
decade brought the vocal minority to
such a crescendo of protest? This is,
after all, the period when women in the
U.S.A. have come to make up more
than 40 per cent of the university
population, when liberalized divorce
laws, varied birth control methods,
and technological improvements have
guaranteed them tremendous personal
freedom, when women on their own
merit have achieved distinction in
politics as members of Congress,
mayors of cities, state legislators, and
when the important New England state
of Connecticut now has a woman
governor.
So why, when women as a whole
exert unprecedented influence both on
family and public policy, have modern
feminists been moved to characterize
the female role in society as being an
outrageously subservient one?
For one thing, they point to what
they see as glaring inequities in the
work world. Of the 35 million women
employed in the United States a third
are secretaries or clerks, and over a
fifth are service workers, such as
waitresses or domestics. They are
poorly represented in the professions
and in management.
The average yearly income of full-
time female workers is less than two-
thirds of the male average. (Of
course, this differentiation is to some
extent one of circumstance rather than
of discrimination: women tend to leave
jobs, for family reasons, before they
reach the highest salary level, and
men in blue-collar jobs tend to belong
to unions that have won high wage
rates.)
Further, when men and women do
equal work, women often get lesser
titles and lower pay. Women who
are full professors earn an average of
ten per cent less than men, and the
disparities are even greater in other
fields.
The women's movement cited ad¬
ditional grievances. Some states still
discriminated against women in in¬
heritance rights and in the control
of their own property in marriage.
Some universities still denied women
equal access to professional schools
or to scholarships. And some state
laws still treated women more harshly
than men for certain types of crimes.
There is no doubt that these are
legitimate areas in which to demand
reforms, but there were also larger
cultural and social forces which ac¬
counted for the urgency and energy
of the Women's Liberation Movement.
In this view, modern woman is at the
mercy, not so much of men, as of rapid
social change urbanization, science
and technology.
In the predominantly rural society
that America was up to around 1900,
a wife and mother was often employed
from early morning until late at night,
baking bread, preparing meals, wash¬
ing, sewing, knitting, and fetching water
from the well. But today small mobile
families have made the home less
central and stable than it once was;
and electric refrigerators, washing
machines and frozen foods have
relegated the female to the most minor
chores of homemaking.
No wonder that she needs to recover
her lost value and self-respect by
seeking new roles in the outside world.
Possessing leisure and often a college
education, caught up in our current
passion for questioning all traditional
values and institutions, she has become
a recruit for the revolution of rising
expectations.
Yet all of these grievances simmered
below the surface until the mid-1960s.
There were hints of restiveness
directly after World War II when
thousands of women who had worked
in defence industries relinquished their
jobs to demobilized veterans, and dis¬
covered that full-time homemaking was
an anticlimax after the status and
excitement of going to work.
ln_ 1952, an English translation of
The "Second Sex, by the French phil¬
osopher Simone de Beauvoir, stoked
the fires of intellectual rebellion. But
despite these provocations, the rumble
of feminism was hardly audible in the
1950s, partly because most women
were deeply relieved to have their men
home from the battlefields.
What brought all these dormant dis¬
satisfactions to consciousness was the
publication in 1963 of Betty Friedan's
The Feminine Mystique. Based mainly
on interviews with her classmates
15 years after graduation from a
women's college, her book formulated
what the author called "the problem
that has no name," an unspoken
discontent that prevailed among thou¬
sands of educated women.
Many of them had eagerly embarked
upon marriage and domesticity in an
effort to compensate for the loneliness
of the war years, yet a decade later
she found them tired and unfulfilled,
victims of "the feminine mystique", the
view which educators, the media and
business conspired to impose: that
motherhood and housekeeping were
the most rewarding occupations for
women.
Against this notion Mrs. Friedan
argued vehemently: "The only way
for a woman, as for a man, to find
herself, to know herself as a person,
is by creative work of her own." The
impact of her book was enormous it
sold one and a half million copies and
the women's liberation movement as it
now exists in America must date itself
from its publication.
In 1966, Betty Friedan formally
launched the National Organization of
Women (NOW), a moderate group that
acted, for the first time in the United
States, as a lobby to press for equality
of women in all spheres. Its member¬
ship was composed mainly of pro¬
fessional women and middle-class
housewives, its language was sober,
and its goals were largely political and
economic.
NOW's strong support was in good
part responsible for the rapid passage
by the U.S. Congress of the Equal

Rights Amendment and its subsequent
approval by 34 state legislatures; and
for removing specification as to sex
from the "help wanted" section of
newspapers. It also worked for
vigorous enforcement of the Equal Pay
Act of 1963, and by 1974 more than
$50 million in back wages had been
awarded to over 100,000 female em¬
ployees.
But if it was relatively militant in
terms of practical reforms, NOW did
not seem to meet the emotional re¬
quirements of younger or lower-class
women, who were in search of some
more primary confrontation with men.
A number of splinter groups and new
organizations were formed, many of
them calling for a total revaluation of
male-female relations.
Some questioned such traditional
her widely discussed book, Sexual
Politics, argues that ever since the
establishment of patriarchal society,
the status accorded women has been
a demeaning one, that of chattel and
homemaker.
A very different perspective is pro¬
vided by anthropologist George Mur-
dock who found that even in pre-
patriarchal times, in 224 primitive
societies, war-making has been exclus¬
ively a male function and child-rearing
exclusively female; and that it was
always males who performed the
strenuous, risky tasks, while women
took on the more sedentary, nurturant
ones. In this view, the sexual division
of roles was simply an efficient tech¬
nique for survival, rather than a delib¬
erate male conspiracy.
Another question that has touched

graving of the first
women's rights con¬
vention in the U.S.,
held at Seneca Falls,
New York State, in
1848. Led by Eliza¬
beth Cady Stanton,

suffrage in the U.S..
as well as calling for

political, social and
domestic status.
institutions as the "nuclear family"
(consisting of only parents and chil¬
dren); others even argued that marriage
must be abolished because "it has the
same effect the institution of slavery
had." (The passionate rhetoric and
often disruptive tactics of these radical
groups were clearly borrowed from the
civil rights movement which reached
its peak of activism and success in
the mid-1960s.)
In my opinion, most American women
still look for emotional security and
gratification in their own families, and
are not aware of any far-reaching
exploitation by men. Indeed a number
of women might admit, if they are
honest, that they themselves are often
In the role of exploiter. And they
might willingly accept the anthropo¬
logical view that the family was created
precisely for the protection of women
and children during the periods of
their helplessness.
Nevertheless, the feminist movement
has acted as an intellectual spur. It
has ensured public debate on a number
of fundamental questions that have not,
until now, received lively consideration.
The question that has aroused most
controversy is: what roles have women
played throughout civilization and
why? Militant feminist Kate Millet, in
off a lively and still ongoing debate is:
how much of the differences between
men and women are biological and
how much cultural? Clearly, men are
generally taller, stronger and more
muscular; while women have their own
special genetic and hormonal makeup,
which is rooted in their capacity for
motherhood.
But do these differences explain
the differences in social attitude and
behaviour e.g., dress and demeanour,
personal adornment, sexual initiative
of male and female? The evidence
so far is inconclusive because it is
hard to isolate specific behaviour from
the larger cultural context. But
some of the traditional notions about
women's inferiority in abstract intel¬
lectual work or in administrative ability
have been placed in doubt as women
have moved in larger numbers into
these fields.
The Women's Liberation Movement
has clearly done an important service
in bringing feminine discontents and
desire for self-improvement into the
arena of public discussion. By doing
so it has changed the emotional ambi¬
ence of male-female relationships and
made them in some ways more resilient
and elastic. The movement can also
take credit for the rapid opening up
of educational and career opportunities
for women. To cite only two examples:
between 1965 and 1973 female enroll¬
ment in medical schools nearly doubled
and in law schools more than tripled.
Many inequalities, of course, still
exist. Women still earn considerably
less than men in all major occupations
at a time when more and more U.S.
families are headed by women, many
without incomes other than their
salaries. While inequities are nar¬
rowing in education, women are not
yet even near parity with men at the
postgraduate level or in professional
schools. Labour unions have been
accused of resisting the admission of
women to full equality in job-training
and apprenticeship programmes.
In the effort to eliminate such griev¬
ances, the Women's Liberation Move¬
ment has been successful in gaining
support from an increasing number of
working-class women, as well as from
a surprisingly large proportion of men
who, in public opinion polls, show a
greater approval of the movement's
goals than women.
Without doubt, the next decade will
see a growing movement of women
into all occupations and areas of
American life: in the professions, in
politics, and in the academic world.
Even today, despite remnants of
discrimination, a woman can choose
how she wishes to order her life. She
can devote herself to marriage, or
pursue a career, or opt for both and
derive considerable satisfaction from
managing the practical difficulties this
may present. She may decide on a
part-time career and deliberately give
precedence to home and motherhood.
Women are not homogeneous. Some
are eager to make their way in the
outside world, and some prefer not to
compete with men. Perhaps for the
first time in history, the variety of
choices open to them will correspond
to the variety of their impulses.

$65 million :
one company's penalty
for sexist discrimination
The consequences of an anti-discrimination law
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1964
by Lynn Payer
LYNN PAYER, American medical journalist
now working In Paris, was directly concerned
with the problems of equal working opportunities
for women when she served on the employment
committee of the National Organization of
Women (NOW) in New York.
AN aluminium company in the
United States was recently
ordered to pay $190,000 in back
wages and court costs to 276 women
who alleged that the company had
maintained sex-segregated job classi- .
fications by changing jobs formerly
classified "male" and "female" to
"heavy" and "light".
A U.S. finance corporation paid
more than $125,000 to white-collar
female employees who charged that
they were denied- promotion because
of their sex.
These are just two examples of
what has been made possible by the
Civil Rights Act which was passed by
the United States Congress in 1964.
Although most Americans recognized
that the law would have far-reaching
consequences for Negro rights, few
were aware at the time that it con¬
tained a clause that would provide
much of the muscle behind equal em¬
ployment opportunity for women.
For among the many amendments
to the original act, a Southern Con¬
gressman, anxious to defeat the bill,
slipped the word "sex" into Title VII,

Even through a magnifying glass you will find it hard to pick out a single woman
among these assembled white collar workers, left, at a U.S. automobile plant.
On the other hand numerous men supporters have joined in the New York
Women's Lib demonstration above. In its fight to assert equality of rights for
women in all fields, the Women's Liberation movement in the USA has made a
special target of the job discrimination so often practised against women. Under
the Civil Rights Act, many women victims of this discrimination have
successfully taken legal action against offending companies.
pertaining to equal employment oppor¬
tunity. Title VII, as it was finally
voted, therefore, prohibited discrimi¬
nation because of race, colour, religion,
sex, or national origin, in any term,
condition or privilege of employment.
Thus while the U.S. courts have not
consistently interpreted the U.S. Cons¬
titution to mean that U.S. women, as
well as U.S. men, enjoy equal protec¬
tion under the law, and while the Equal
Rights Amendment has not yet been
ratified by a sufficient number of sta¬
tes, women have been given the legal
basis for equal rights in one important
area, that of employment.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is
administered by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and is inter¬
preted by the U.S. courts. Both have
tended to broaden their view of what
constitutes discrimination. When the
equal employment laws were first
enacted, it was generally believed that
discrimination took place primarily
through conscious, overt actions
against individuals. Now, the view is
that discrimination also takes place
through seemingly neutral employment
practices.
The commission and the courts
thus decided that the proof of discri
mination, or lack of it, must lie in the
result. If all executive positions, or
most of them, are filled by men and
all or most secretarial positions are
filled by women, this constitutes strong
evidence that sex-discrimination is
consciously or unconsciously practised
by the company.
The law works this way: If a woman
thinks that she has been discriminated
against in advertising, recruitment,
hiring, firing, salary, promotions, etc.,
she files a complaint with the commis¬
sion or with other agencies at the
local, state, or federal level. (For
example, if the company receives fed¬
eral contracts, she may file her com¬
plaint with the Office of Federal Con¬
tract Compliance).
The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or the other agency con¬
cerned then sends investigators into
the named company. These investi¬
gators have the right to question em¬
ployees, including top executives, and'
also have access to company records.
If they find that the proportion of
women in a given job category differs
from the proportion of women in the
labour pool, discrimination is assumed,
unless the company proves otherwise.
Thus, if they find that all telephone

WOMEN PAINTERS
OF NORTHERN INDIA
The paintings reproduced on the following colour pages have been produced
by village women of Mithila, a province in Bihar State, in northeast India.
The women create these masterpieces in their spare time from the daily
routine of cooking, caring for children and working in the fields.
Mithila's women conjure up vivid colours by skilful mixing of minerals and
vegetables: blue from the leaves of the Indigo plant, yellow from orpiment
(a natural mineral form of arsenic), red from logwood or sandalwood.
Mixtures of these colours give them green and orange hues. Their paintings,
full of grace and elegance, portray scenes from the lives of the gods Krishna
with his flute, Shiva with his wives, some gentle, some fearsome to behold,
as well as episodes from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, depicting exploits
of men and animals who are none other than gods in disguise. Delicately
executed with brushes improvised from bamboo splinters to which wads
of wild cotton are attached, the paintings are executed on the occasion of
various ceremonies and celebrations. They adorn the walls of marriage
chambers, embellish the wrapping paper for ritual gifts, and also decorate
the letters, known as "kohabars" in which Mithila's girls traditionally ask
for a husband's hand. Using rice-water and dung, Mithila's women trace
out remarkable images on courtyard floors, to mark the altars, or "Arlpanas",
where household rituals are performed.
In these many ways the women of Mithila apply their creative talents to
various aspects of everyday life, while adding colour and lustre to festivals
or prayer. Long unknown outside their province, their exquisite work is
today much sought after by art collectors and museum curators, and,
recognizing their talents, the government of Bihar now provides these women
with paper for their work.
Their art has now been revealed to the Western world through collections
brought back from Mithila a small province which 1,500 years ago was
one of India's first kingdoms by a French writer and teacher, Yves Véquaud.
Exhibitions have been held in Paris at the Musée de l'Homme (in 1973), and
at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (early in 1975). They have shown how
Mithila's ancient traditional art, created entirely by the skill and talents of
women artists, has been preserved and enriched.

Just carried out by Unesco National
Commissions in Argentina, Ivory Coast,
Lebanon, Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka
for Unesco and ILO
A UNESCO INQUIRY
ON WOMEN'S STATUS
IN FIVE COUNTRIES
Aj o i n t Unesco - International
Labour Organization inquiry
into the status of women in five coun¬
tries Argentina, the Ivory Coast, Leb¬
anon, Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka
was completed on the eve of Interna¬
tional Women's Year.
Carried out during 1974 by the
Unesco National Commissions, of the
five countries, the studies focussed on
the opportunities open to women in
education, training and employment.
They revealed that in all these
countries, which differ widely geo¬
graphically and culturally, women still
do not enjoy in practice the equal status
with men to which the law entitles
them. They have not yet achieved
equality in education (fewer women
than men are studying in schools and
universities); in earnings (most of them
have poorly paid jobs); or in job
opportunities and responsibility (few
women occupy top posts) (1).

"Women, Education, Equality: a decade of
experiment" describing three projects to
promote equal educational opportunities for
women in Upper Volta, Nepal and Chile.

ANTONY BROCK, British writer and journalist
specializing in educational questions, is English
language editor In Unesco's Press Division.
Take the case of the
Lebanon, which stands
at the crossroads of East and West.
The Lebanese woman is equal before
the law and enjoys the same rights
and duties under the Constitution as
men.
But although women are full citizens
with the right to vote at 21, not one
woman representative was in parlia¬
ment at the time of the inquiry.
Legally speaking, as a minor a woman
is subject to her father who may
betrothe her to a man of his choice
once she is nine years old, as long
as she consents and the marriage does
not take place before she reaches
puberty.
At 18 she may marry without parental
consent but once she is married the
Family Code requires her to obey her
husband in everything "which is not
forbidden by law". This means that
she needs his authorization to choose
a profession or carry on a trade and
she has no right to any allowance
from the husband if she continues
working without his consent, although
she may be obliged to pay an
allowance to her husband from her
income if it is he who is in need.
A poll carried out with a small
sample of Lebanese men and women
showed that it was age and tradition
which most influenced the attitude of
men towards women being educated
and taking jobs, with the 50-65 year-
old group showing the most opposition.
The attitude of Lebanese women,
however, varied according to the
degree of education they themselves
had received; those with only primary
and secondary education gave priority
to the roles of wife and mother and
thought that for this reason a girl's
education should differ from a boy's;
those with university education saw
no reason for making a difference and
believed that women ought to be able
to take the same posts as men, urging
the establishment of child-care centres
to help working mothers.
Despite some recent break-throughs
into traditional "men's jobs" (in the
police, serving in restaurants, working
in precision engineering factories), the
major obstacle to women's progress
in the Lebanon is still the idea of
"men's work" and "women's work",
women's work being generally associ¬
ated with housekeeping, minimum ^

qualifications and minimum wages.
State-run training institutions make
no distinction between boys and girls
but provide residential accommodation
only for boys. So few girls go to
these centres.
A poll of girl students showed that
teaching was the first choice of
profession (31 per cent) with medicine
and nursing second although some
way behind, with 12 per cent. This
order of priorities showed the same
basic idea of what constitutes
"women's work", as in other countries.
SRI LANKA
In Sri Lanka, for
example, women make
up the largest proportion of unqualified
teachers and the vast majority of the
nursing profession both traditionally
women's jobs. However, women
doctors, forming only 5 per cent of the
medical profession some ten years
ago, now total 33 per cent, as women
move into the decision-taking area of
medicine.
This progress of women into the
ranks of the professionally qualified
not in itself surprising in Sri Lanka,
where a woman became Prime Minister
back in 1960 is in line with a trend
for girls to receive more education:
more of them are enrolled than boys
in secondary schools, while the number
of women entering university has risen
sharply during the last decade to the
point where they outnumber boys on
one campus.
The Sri Lanka study shows that
women make up a quarter of the
labour force and those who work are
protected by a number of legal pro¬
visions governing employment. Equal
pay is the rule in State jobs which,
like those in a number of the better
private firms, provide for maternity
leave with pay.
But this does not mean that women
in Sri Lanka can count their battle won.
Despite their equal access to edu¬
cation, less than a third of the women
in the working age group are employ¬
ed. Half of those who work are in
farming an occupation where skills
and pay are low.
In Sri Lanka women are regarded
as the weaker sex, who need pro¬
tection and whose primary function is
that of homemaker. Many employers
share this view, the study shows, and
regard employment outside the home
as a secondary need to supplement
family resources. And since the
country has a high level of unemploy¬
ment they tend to give preference to
men for employment and promotion.
As the report notes: "The instability
characteristic of women's employment
in some areas was considered a
good reason by some employers for
not providing training facilities" thus
extending the vicious circle whereby
women are regarded as not useful
because they are untrained and are
left untrained because they are not
useful.
But the employer's attitude is
matched by an ambivalent attitude of
women themselves. Although a job
is now regarded as a long-term pro¬
position if not always a vocation, some
unmarried women workers "still regard
employment as a temporary expedient
to spend their time profitably between
school and marriage" and so fail to
take advantage of training if offered.
Sri Lankan girls are also dis¬
advantaged in a vocational education
system which fails to meet the needs
of a large-enough proportion of school
leavers and puts them even farther
behind in the competition for jobs,
while the schools tend to reserve
woodwork and metalwork classes for
boys and home science and needle¬
work for girls, "thereby creating an
artificial division between the sexes."
SIERRA LEONE Although Sierra
Leone, in Africa,
has a different economy, tradition,
history and culture, the conclusions
of its study show some striking
similarities with those from Lebanon,
Sri Lanka and the other countries
co-operating in the investigation.
In Sierra Leone women have the
same constitutional rights as men and
the law bars any discrimination in
education. While successful pro¬
fessional women are no rarity and
while for the educated woman the
opportunity of developing her capa¬
bilities to the full exists, real equality
has still not been assured.
Women in Sierra Leone may opt for
a Christian or monogamous union when
they marry or may marry under Muslim
or Customary Law, in which case they
may have to share their husband and
conform to a system of seniority in
which the husband decides who Is to
be head wife. With the spread of
education, many women are choosing
monogamous unions whatever their
religion.
Economic independence for women
was not generally approved of in
Sierra Leone. Over 66 per cent of
men and 48 per cent of women inter¬
viewed felt that a wife would then
"want to leave her husband on the
slightest excuse", while a slightly
lower percentage (65 per cent men
and 46.5 per cent women) believed
that the economically independent
wife would not give her husband his
due respect.

The Unesco National Commissions of
Argentina, the Ivory Coast, Lebanon,
Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka recently
carried out studies into the
opportunities open to women in
education, training and employment
as part of a joint Unesco-International
Labour Organization inquiry. The
investigations, carried out by means
of polls, statistical research and
interviews with teachers, employers,
workers and the general public showed
the extent to which women still
suffer from the effects of
discrimination and inequality.
of labour into men's work and women's
work: male nurses, secretaries and
social workers outnumber women in
these fields.
However, as elsewhere, fewer girls
than boys are in school at all levels,
there is no possibility ' for them to
become apprentices, and educational
institutions reserved for boys out¬
number those for girls by more than
four to one. The introduction of cash
crops has meant that women are less
and less willing to provide free labour
on the land, and the growth of edu
cation has brought with it the idea of
sex equality, leading some girls to
refuse to marry illiterate husbands.
ADPrilTlUA Some of the features
AlfUtnllNA of women's life in
Argentina, fifth country in the study,
also serve as a warning against too-
easy generalizations and particularly
against seeking to equate access to
education with access to work which
is personally or financially rewarding.
Although education is uniform for
both sexes, girls seem to have the
edge over boys. There is general
approval of girls studying seriously
and regularly: fewer girls than boys
fail to enter school, they attend more
regularly and more of them complete
their primary education. Even in
higher education, Where until recently
men outnumbered women by two to
one, the proportion of women is now
rising rapidly.
At this level, if the results of an
investigation at one university are
typical, women tend to qualify more
quickly than men. Moreover women ,.

L engineering and agricultural courses.
At the University of Buenos Aires,
women have recently been out¬
numbering men in natural sciences,
biochemistry and pharmacy courses.
There is little declared opposition to
women working outside the home but
the Argentinian study notes that
"despite all the favourable declar¬
ations. . .when one comes to medium
or higher level posts men are preferred
to women." This situation may now
be evolving rapidly but one of the
striking features noted is that "pro¬
gress in education is not being
followed by a proportional increase of
integration into paid work."
The national average of women
employed in industry in Argentina is
below 20 per cent and unemployed
women waiting for their first job out¬
number men by nearly two to one in
several big cities.
Three classes of obstacles in the
way of full integration of women into
the productive system are picked out
by the report. They are:
social: family structure continues
to dominate ideas, the woman being
allotted a secondary role and her
work regarded as a complementary
source of family income;
cultural: one aspect of Latin
American "machismo" (see article
page 18) is the scorn of some men
for the affective side of life compared
with the productive side, with women
being regarded as unsuited to pro¬
duction work. Such prejudices also
bar women from executive posts "since
men will not accept decisions taken
by women outside the family circle";
economic: unemployment affects
more women than men, and women
unable to meet the demands of
technological development for higher
professional qualifications are thus
excluded from considerable areas of
employment.
If unemployment problems are solv¬
ed, the study notes, women will be
more favoured in the future. But this
alone will not speed the promotion of
women in employment; to do this "an
aggressive policy of cultural change"
is required not only for women but
also for employers and trades unions
in order that joint action can gradually
wear away the prejudices against
women in productive life.
This applies to all five countries
covered by the Unesco-ILO investi¬
gation. Any real progress in improv¬
ing the status of women will involve
not sb much a change in present
structures as a change in the mentality
which finds these structures tolerable.

Elena Gianini Belotti
ELENA GIANINI BELOTTI is director of the
Montessori Birth Centre in Rome, which gives
psychological and practical training on the role of
parents to expectant mothers and future fathers.
She is the author of a study on the influence of
social conditioning in developing the feminine
role during the first years of life ("Dalla parte
délie bambine L'influenza dei condizionamenti
sociall nella formazione del ruolo femminile nei
primi annl dl vita") published by Feltrinelli,
Milan in 1973.
IT is obvious that biological differ¬
ences between male and female
exist and are essential to procreation.
But it is not obvious that these biologi¬
cal differences are responsible for
psychological and intellectual differ¬
ences.
It is even less justifiable that bio¬
logical dissimilarities should be trans¬
lated into social differences implying
that men .are superior to women. Such
differences could equally well be seen
as feminine superiority and masculine
inferiority.
A female mammal normally cares for
and protects her young only when they
need her, and not throughout her life,
as does a woman the human female
mammal. On the contrary, the female
animal behaves exactly like the male
of the same species, with the same
independence and aggressivity, except
during the strictly limited period of her
motherhood.
It is clear that women are conditioned
from infancy for their future role^

This baby girl chortles happily as she splashes around
in the kitchen sink. Will she still smile in a few
years time when her mother says "Do the washing
up" while her brothers are outside doing more
adventurous things ? But perhaps by then the
traditional idea that only girls should help
with housework will be a thing of the past.
Was mothers and that all aspects of
their lives are marked by this condition¬
ing, even though they may never have
children. Motherhood has thus been
made an Instrument for woman's social
and cultural subjection, through man's
control of her sexual and reproductive
functions.
In other words, the patriarchal
system, a social structure linked to
property and the possession of women,
has made women second class citi¬
zens, with well-defined duties and func¬
tions that are more limited than men's.
But the cultural and social subordi¬
nation of women is only one aspect
though a major one of the "values"
that Western culture fosters in order to
preserve itself. Others are the
"superiority" of the white man, of
capital over labour, of adults over
children and old people, of the healthy
over the sick, of the "normal" over
those who are "different".
Western culture considers efficiency,
competitiveness, success, money and
productivity as desirable and valuable
assets, even if they are detrimental to
the social fabric, to personal fulfilment,
to social solidarity and conviviality.
Education that conditions people to
accept things as they are is typical
' of Western society. It does not wel¬
come those who criticize and disturb it.
It wants consenting individuals who
accept its rules, its values, and its
demands. And the consent of women
to this state of affairs is essential,
since they provide a vast number of
free "services".
Women who rebel against being
a marginal and exploited caste are
a threat to the masculine role and all
its privileges. That is why there is
a widespread effort to contain feminine
revolt.
The preservation of patriarchal
society and of capitalism requires not
only that they should be accepted
by women but also that women should
transmit their values to" oncoming
generations through the early training
that is almost always in women's
hands. So what happens is that
young boys get one kind of education
and young girls another.
An understanding of how this train¬
ing operates calls for a patient and
systematic examination of the relations
between adults and between adults and
children as we see them in everyday
life.
We need to examine the significance
of small actions and apparently trivial
remarks that, having been used so
often, have become mechanical, auto¬
matic reactions which we accept
without analysing their significance
and purpose.
We need to look at disputes,
hardships and sufferings of which we
women are victims when we fail to
conform to majority behaviour; to
examine ideologies that we accept as
absolute and eternal though times
have changed and experience has
shown how many other ideologies have
proved to be neither absolute nor
eternal; and to re-appraise usages and
customs and rigid codes that we dare
not infringe.
This conditioning and these values
are transmitted virtually unchanged
from one generation to the next, at an
age when we accept fully and un¬
critically everything we are taught.
Sometimes as adults we realize
that we have been victims of real
oppression and of manifest injustice.
But the task of regaining our own
proper identity is a daunting one
because it means open contestation
with the consenting majority.
Conditioning starts with parental and
social expectations about the birth of
a child. Attitudes differ for a boy or a
girl, precisely because different social
values are given to the two sexes.
The birth of a boy is clearly preferred;
naturally so in a patriarchal culture.
Opinion polls and cartoons show
that the ideal family consists of two
children, of whom the elder is a boy.
|
.wr -
This pattern is repeated in the vast
majority of children's books.
The masculine-feminine roles are
already established when children are
infants. Girls are passive and in¬
active; they play mainly with dolls and
help their mothers with household
tasks. Boys are active; they study,
they play adventurous games and never
do housework unless there is some
prestige attached to it and a certain
freedom to make independent de¬
cisions.
Parents too are presented as
stereotypes in children's books, as
part of an established hierarchy with
father as the figure of authority at
home and the breadwinner outside,
and mother at home, responsible for
the housework.
If parents expecting the birth of a
child are asked their preferences,
fathers-to-be almost always say they
hope a first-born child will be a boy.
This bears out perfectly what is
expected of a man, who will naturally
want a boy who will perpetuate him
and his privileges.
Women are less . explicit, either
because they are expected to have
less definite opinions, or because their
views are genuinely ambivalent, or
because of idealization of the maternal

role (which is another aspect of the
oppression of women) according to
which a mother should have no pref¬
erences but ought to want and love
all her children equally well.
If we analyse these preferences we-
find that the expectations that go with
them are profoundly different for the
two sexes. A boy is wanted because
it is hoped he will succeed in life,
make his mark professionally, acquire
prestige and authority, and "honour"
the family name which he alone will
pass on. A boy therefore is wanted
and awaited for what he will be.
On the other hand, a girl will be
expected to provide "services" that
right from the start will mark her status
as Inferior. What will be expected
from her is gratitude, company,
domestic help, affection, support,
good manners, a pleasing appearance
and psychological dependence on the
family. The girl therefore is wanted
for what she will give.
Clearly, the desire to have children
of different sexes and the marked
preference for boys would lose much
of their importance if parents believed
that both sexes had identical possi¬
bilities of succeeding in life that is,
if they were considered socially equal
and therefore treated as such.
The result is that even before they
are born, girls are prepared for a future
of intellectual and social underdevel¬
opment.
The different training given to
children according to their sex is quite
simply outrageous. Girls are forced
to suppress their innate impulse to
prove themselves as individuals (an
impulse as strong in girls as in boys),
so as to conform to a stereotyped
second-class model, below their poten¬
tialities.
Strong psychological dependence
on the authority of the male is induced
in a girl through education or through
having to model herself on her own
mother, who herself is dependent on
the male figure.
Later this psychological dependence
on a father figure will be extended to
all the men that the girl will meet as
a woman. Her energies will be placed
at the disposal of men, so as to give
them the material support and affection
they need for their own personal
achievement.
Thus the little girl becomes an indi¬
vidual programmed to be at the ser¬
vice of others, and is satisfied to be
so, or is made to feel guilty if she is
dissatisfied.
From infancy little girls learn that
motherhood is their only way to self-
fulfilment. A girl is taught from her
earliest years to regard work which
would give her economic freedom (but
not necessarily psychological freedom
also) as merely a way of filling in the
time before she meets her man and
prepares to play her role as wife-
mother-housekeeper.
So the type of work towards which
a woman's choice is canalized is defi¬
nitely subordinate, with little prestige
or remuneration. Often the job will
be part-time, in order to allow her to
fulfil her principal role in the home.
Careful analysis of the day-to-day
behaviour of parents towards a child
from the time it is born, reveals some
interesting facts especially in the
case of the mother. Though the
mother is the most important person
in the child's life for a long time, she
is not free to act independently. She
reacts to what the cultural and social
environment requires of her; and she
is profoundly influenced, in bringing
up the child, by the authority of the
father.
Even if a man has little to do with
the daily needs of a child still being
breastfed, he is and remains the
authoritarian figure within the family.
The woman depends on him and p

The trio of budding mannequins

womanhood. Already in children's
games the barriers between the sexes
are clearly marked out.
jV complies with his wishes and expec¬
tations. After all she has been brought
up to consent to and accept masculine
values.
Daily relations between mother and
child are marked by a series of
repeated rituals: meals, washing, bath¬
ing, hygiene, sleep, bowel movements,
all of which help to "structure" the
child psychologically and can be
carried out in different ways.
A closer look at these seemingly
banal rituals reveals an emotional
atmosphere that differs with each
mother and therefore for each child.
In it the sex of the child plays a
crucial role.
By and large a mother creates a
more tolerant and indulgent atmos¬
phere if the child is a boy, while for
a girl the atmosphere is more rigid
and disciplined, though it is also more
affectionate.
Girls are led towards an early
autonomy in little matters (eating by
themselves, keeping, clean, playing
alone, tidying up after play, etc.), but
all within the restricted family orbit.
Only small choices are allowed to
them, never those that imply a real
psychological autonomy.
A girl's aggressivity is constantly
suppressed, and so is her need to
move about, to explore, to learn. There
is a tendency to make her into an
inactive little creature who has no
other choice than to foster certain
abilities that are typical of sedentary
people, such as manual dexterity.
(Prisoners, deprived of liberty and
movement, also tend to develop
manual skills to compensate for their
lack of freedom.)
Little boys, however, are required
to display a more genuine kind of
independence that leads to wider
choices. They are allowed more time
to play, and more time to be idle.
A recent inquiry into the toys parents
buy for their children showed that
they not only spend more on boys but
buy them a wider range of toys than
they give to girls, who are usually
limited to gifts of dolls, miniature
kitchens and such like.
The restrictions imposed on little
girls are shown more clearly if the girls
are "hypertonic" that is, lively, in¬
quisitive, active and enterprising
qualities that are considered typically
masculine.
"Hypotonic" girls those who are
quiet, passive and sedentary are the
perfect stereotype and correspond to
their parents' expectations. Because
it is easy to see them as "objects",
they are caressed, protected and
indulged; but this helps to accen-

tuate their dependence and passivity.
The hypertonic boy also cor¬
responds to a stereotype, and is
accepted as such, while the boy who
is naturally hypotonic is pushed and
stimulated towards action and aggres-
sivity. In this way his natural tem¬
perament too is violated.
Conformity to masculine and femi¬
nine cultural models is not simply
obtained through training, whether
this comes from the family or from the
school. The child himself contributes
In two ways that are natural to very
young children: by imitation and by
identification.
Impelled by the need to identify
with an adult of the same sex, the
child finds such a model and adapts
to it, naturally with personal variations
due to his particular temperament. It
follows that a child will come to
accept a conventional model of men
and women. The little girl will accept
the inferiority of her sex, and the boy
the superiority and the privileges that
go with being a man.
If only the two parents resembled
each other more, filled the same social
roles and had the same level of
education and intellectual develop¬
ment; if they enjoyed the same esteem,
social dignity and economic equality,
then the children's identification
with either father or mother would not
produce such profound differences.
We would reach the point where male
and female roles were obliterated and
individuals would be valued as such
and not, a priori, as belonging to one
sex rather than to the other.
So we should not aim to train little
girls to behave like boys. The mascu¬
line model as it has been seen through
the centuries should be rejected
outright.
If we consider how much masculine
affectivity has been repressed and.
distorted by our Western kind of edu¬
cation, and to what extent competi¬
tiveness has been exalted, together
with aggressivity, hostility towards
others, lack of co-operation and of
social solidarity, and what the results
have been, then it becomes clear that
the objective is much more revolution¬
ary than that of achieving parity be¬
tween the sexes.
Children must be educated as
individuals who have the right to the
same freedom, autonomy and self-
realization irrespective of their sex.
But the values we teach them must
all be re-examined. They must be
taught sociability, co-operation, convi¬
viality; in other words, values that
teach them to live side by side, not
in confrontation.

TEXTBOOKS, STEREOTYPES
AND ANTI-FEMININE PREJUDICES
Conclusions of an inquiry in France
applicable to many other countries
by Renée Miot
FRENCH primary school textbooks
perpetuate stereotyped images
of women and anti-feminine prejudices.
This was revealed by a recent survey
commissioned by Madame Françoise
Giroud, French Secretary of State with
special responsibility for the status of
women, to investigate "questionable
stereotypes which might give an out¬
dated or disparaging image of women
and domestic life."
Impressions and ideas picked up in
childhood can strongly Influence adult
outlook, and textbooks used in primary
schools play no small part in this
process in France and in many other
countries.
French teachers are nowadays urged
to make less use of textbooks, but
there is one subject the French
language, or at least learning to
read where there is no getting away
from them. The French study of the
image of women therefore concen¬
trated primarily on reading, vocabulary
and grammar books.
The study showed that the same
themes and the same texts recur in
various sets of reading and vocabulary
books, at both the "elementary" (six to
eight years) and "intermediate" (nine
to eleven years) levels. The books
highlight some aspects of women's
R E N Ë E M I OT, French teacher andpsychologist,

the Institut National de la Recherche et de la
Documentation Pédagogique, in Paris. She has
devoted many years to the study of learning
problems experienced by teen-agers and students
for the University Statistics Office, in Paris.
status, but leave many others in
obscurity without giving any expla¬
nations.
Women characters figure frequently
in books for six-to-eight-year-olds, but
with wide variations from one set of
textbooks to another. In books for
nine-to-eleven-year-olds, male charac¬
ters predominate. Adults gradually
fade out and their place is taken by
a teen-age society in which young
people act out the roles of adults.
Girls hardly ever figure in these
groups, and when they do they behave
like women, either imitating them in
their games or actually replacing them
(as when the mother of a family is ill,
for example).
Women are described insuch a way
as to show them as always weaker
than men. Little girls are fragile and
sickly. In innumerable fairy stories,
older girls need a fairy's magic wand
or the arrival of a man (prince or
shepherd) to make their dreams come
true.
In a modern setting, women are
shown as being incapable of mastering
mechanical devices, and more than
one textbook makes fun of women
drivers who cause traffic jams and
are accident-prone. Women turn to
men for support and assistance,
without which they would be quite
defenceless.
The few examples of equality be¬
tween the sexes are found only among
children or in teen-age games. In one
instance, a calm, sensible, kindly girl
gives new heart to a boy who has been
left alone to fend for himself.
Women appear in a position of
superiority to children only when they
are depicted as teachers: a firm, com¬
petent schoolmistress, for example,
manages to bring a difficult boy under
her control.
Another point worth noting is that,
with the exception of Marie Curie, very
few famous women are held up as
models for children in the nine to
eleven age group.
Some passages in school textbooks,
mostly taken from nineteenth-century
literature, do however show women
who appear to be impelled by some
inner force which contrasts sharply
with their physical weakness and
vulnerability.
Women in these cases are shown
living in dreadful conditions, beset by
illness and poverty. By hard work,
endless devotion and self-sacrifice
they manage to overcome their
adversities, thus offering an example
to be admired and emulated. In one
case a poor widow wears her fingers
to the bone in order to feed and
clothe her children and in another,
a mother dies to save her daughter.
This moral force enables them to do
unaided what most women are shown
as being able to do only with the help
of men. It is noteworthy, however,
that all these outstanding women are
mothers.
Indeed, in school textbooks women
are above all shown as mothers, and
among humans and animals alike, the
mother is essentially the one who
feeds the young and gives them their
basic education. ^

STEREOTYPES
IN SCHOOLBOOKS
Traditional stereotypes which perpetuate the idea of a
rigid distinction between the roles of men and women
in daily life are still found in the texts and images
of school textbooks and continue to influence the
ideas of children from an early age, reports an inquiry
into this question carried out in France. On these
pages we present a few examples of illustrations taken
from schoolbooks in France (1). Turkey (2), USSR (3)
and the German Democratic Republic (4). Women are
almost always shown in their role of mother; daughters
are seen using a vacuum cleaner, serving at table
or helping mother. Boys apparently never do such jobs.
W The ¡mage of the mother feeding her
young comes up again and again,
though rather less often in books for
nine to eleven year-olds: "Mummy
helps baby to eat, takes his plate, cuts
the pieces that are too big, breaks up
the bread..." Even in stories about
shipwrecks, it is still the mother who
sees to the feeding of the family.
Mother animals also teach their
young: "Come along, says Mummy
bear, come and learn to climb the
tree..." and gradually she teaches the
young bear to overcome bigger and
bigger obstacles. Generally speaking,
the mothers portrayed are good at
teaching their children, but they teach
only practical skills and techniques
such as sewing and ironing. They
have difficulty in imposing their auth¬
ority: "Mummy used to tell us off for
misbehaving and often threatened to
tell father what we had done wrong."
Grandmothers are presented in the
same way as mothers; they do the
family cooking, teach their grand
children to read or do the everyday
jobs about the farm. If a mother is
away or has died the eldest daughter
mothers the other children in her place.
Sometimes, particularly when the
mother is a widow, she has to feed
and bring up her children under the
most trying conditions. In such cases,
she is admired and loved even more
by her children.
It is mainly in the older reading
books that children give expression
to their love and gratitude, rather than
in the more recent vocabulary books,
as if this were a literary genre which
is now outdated. In more recent
books, children show their affection on
Mother's Day by offering presents and
flowers.
In nearly all the textbooks, particu¬
larly the more recent ones, the mother's
image is associated in text, illustrations
and exercises with flowers: she buys
them, gives or is given them, grows
them and arranges them. This picture
of the mother surrounded with flowers
has replaced the long-suffering figure
of the older reading books.
But the most significant ideas are
conveyed in an insidious way through
words and pictures. Their impact is
reinforced by the manner in which
teachers use these texts for written
and oral work.
Texts are chosen in accordance
with the interests of children in the
age group concerned, but their setting
is not that of everyday life. Some of
them are stories specially written for
children, some are legends and others
are basically true or realistic, but are
deprived of their realism by being
situated either in the distant past or
a remote country. All of them per¬
petuate the myths which underlie the
status of women.
These myths are transposed into
a world remote from the world of
adults, a kind of wonderland where
they become "disembodied" and thus
readily assimilable by children. Simi¬
larly, the pictures and short texts used
as the basis for exercises of grammar,
vocabulary or oral expression reintro¬
duce these myths into everyday life
when children are required to describe
holidays and various other real life
events.
It is interesting to compare what
appears in the textbooks with the
generally accepted criteria for measur¬
ing the status of women, such as
marriage, family, social facilities, edu¬
cation, employment, social life and
leisure.
All textbooks
passage about
have at least one
marriage. It thus
comes to take a very important place
in children's minds. In reading books,
marriage is placed in the non-realistic
context of animal stories and fairy
tales, and thus becomes a kind of
sacrosanct and universal myth.

The study of many examples reveals
a simple pattern: marriage is a kind
of two-way arrangement in which
males are on the lookout for beauty
and youth, and offer in exchange
strength, skill, riches or royalty. The
female is after security and wants to
be provided for, and will accept only
the best, the handsomest, the richest
or the strongest, in any case the one
who will look after her; In exchange,
she offers her beauty and her youth,
which she endeavours to show off to
advantage by means of her finery.
Feelings are not shown as entering
into the choice of partner.
A clear distinction is made between
the rôles of husband and wife. The
most widely used reading system
shows the father and mother engaged
in stereotyped activities, arbitrarily
presented as universal: "In all the
countries of the world, among the
Eskimos and in Japan, in Africa and
India, mother prepares the food and
cares for the children, while father
goes hunting or builds the house."
The same general pattern emerges
from passages by modern authors.
The many illustrations and vocabulary
exercises where the mother is shown
knitting while the father reads and the
children play drive home the point that
a woman's place is in the home, and
that it is men who go out to work and
do the most difficult jobs or those
which have most prestige.
The family, as depicted in French
textbooks, is usually quite a large one.
In school reading books, grandparents
are usually shown as living a long
way away, but in the more recent
vocabulary books they share in the life
of their children and grandchildren.
The overall Impression is one of
a large, united, happy but inward-
looking family with relatives but no
friends.
The whole family gets together for
holiday celebrations, which in France
include New Year's Day, and Cand¬
lemas (February 2) In addition to
Christmas. The success of the fes¬
tivities depends on the womenfolk
mothers and grandmothers who make
splendid meals for these occasions.
Illustrations in more recent textbooks
show comfortably, even richly, ap¬
pointed homes filled with household
appliances such as vacuum cleaners,
refrigerators, washing machines, etc.,
and modern kitchens straight out of
glossy magazines. What we see,
particularly in vocabulary books, is the
¡mage of an urban middle-class society
in which the housewife is surrounded
by every material comfort.
Women are rarely shown doing
professional work, and in one set of
textbooks only 27 women's jobs are
mentioned as against 59 for men.
Women are most often seen working
as schoolteachers, saleswomen or
nurses although all the books contain
a few outstanding examples of women
horse riders or journalists.
An obvious effort is made, however,
to show boys a wide range of
occupations which have a certain
appeal for children, though perhaps
not for adults.
Women are never shown producing
anything. Strangely enough, there
are no women doctors in the more
recent books, even those whose
illustrations show school medical in¬
spections, which are in fact usually
carried out by women doctors.
Women's social life seems to be
restricted to shopping. They are
shown as indefatigable shoppers and
every single vocabulary and grammar
book has at least one section on going
to market and another on shopping in
the big stores.
As for leisure activities, illustrations
show women watching television and
knitting (with their women friends or
in the family circle) while men read the
newspapers or do odd jobs.
On holiday or on weekend excur¬
sions, picnicking or camping, women
still do the cooking, while men go off
hunting and fishing, climbing and
skiing. Women only appear to relax
at the seaside, where they are depicted
in bathing costumes lying on the beach.
In the modern world, whose values
tend to be economic ones, the text¬
book image of woman is one of well-
fed contentment; she receives gifts,
buys clothes and fills shopping bags,
but nowhere is she seen doing
anything productive.
It seems obvious that from an early
age children are being conditioned by
school textbooks to regard people as
falling into two categories: strong and ^

weak (men and women) with unequal
status and functions. The former
exercise authority and make decisions,
while the latter are dependent and
submissive, even though their inferi¬
ority is concealed behind the facade
of an affluent consumer society.
This division creates one more ob¬
stacle to the advancement of women,
since- it is unlikely that an adult will
shake off this biased, oversimplified
view of things which has been so
strongly impressed on him in child¬
hood.
The solution can only lie in the
hands of teachers. They need to have
a new and broader concept of their
role, and perhaps all that this new
approach requires is a new way of
using textbooks.
They should use the material in text¬
books, drawn from the literature of the
past, in a free and imaginative way, as
the starting point for a genuine give-
and-take of ideas.
In this way, without any drastic
break with past traditions, there might
be some hope of developing young
people's critical faculties and thereby
an awareness of the reality of human
life in all its diversity and complexity.

The
unrewarded
housewife
by Kirsten Ording Haarr
KIRSTEN ORDING HAARR of Norway is a
leading figure in the Norwegian Housewives'
Association and was a member of its board in
1974-1975. She has published numerous
articles on social questions and is the author of
"Parents as Partners In Schools' a bookpublished
in Oslo in 1971. She has been particularly
active in promoting parent participation in
schools and from 1969 to 1971 served on a
committee set up by the Ministry of Education
to develop shared responsibilities in Norway's
state school system.
IN the eyes of the law, we
Norwegian women have equal
rights with men. But we have still not
answered two vital questions: What
part do we intend to play in our
country's economic, social and cultural
life? To what set of values should
we commit ourselves?
In Norway 579,000 women regard
work in the home and caring for their
children as their main occupation
(although many also do up to 20 hours
a week paid work outside the home).
But only 45,000 of them have joined the
Norwegian Housewives' Association.
Very few of these 579,000 women
are present when economic, social and
human questions are discussed and
when priorities are established and
resources are allocated. The few
women who are present seldom dare,
or even wish, to stand up against the
men who dominate these discussions.
Should we then conclude that
women have no influence on the
development of our modern society?
Not at all. As I see it, women live
according to a set of values which do
not figure on the politician's priority
list. On that list there are only things
that can be measured in quantity or in
terms of money.
And yet society as a whole and
each of its individual members are
dependent for their survival upon
women's values being maintained by
women themselves, of course, but
preferably by men and women working
together.
Mothers of small children have a
24-hour working day (a 168-hour
working week). They get no pay, have
no fixed working hours, no spare time
to call their own, and no holidays
with or without pay. They get no sick
pay and are not insured against
accidents while working at home.
Very few of them have their own
names on the front door or in the
telephone book.
These women are told over and
over again that they have no occu¬
pation and do no real work. For in
our modern society, to work is to do
things, no matter how harmful or
useless, which you are paid for.
A man said recently that a woman
working in the home today is as
obsolete as the horse that once
worked on the farm. In other words,
labour-saving devices have taken over
the housewife's jobs, just as tractors
have taken over from the horse.
His way of thinking seems to me
bereft of logic. As I see it, just as
tractors have made farm hands super¬
fluous, thus rendering the farmer
himself indispensable, instant food
products and modern household equip¬
ment have pushed all other human
hands out of the home, making the
housewife indispensable.
Payment is a poor criterion of
"work". What. happens every time
another woman steps into a house¬
wife's shoes to do part of her work
for parr of the day? The answer is
that everyone regards her as the most
important, hardworking, competent
and indispensable person in the
house, for the simple reason that she
receives money and social benefits
for her work.
A man once asked the Labour
Exchange to send him three home
helps. "Why three?" he was asked.
"My wife is ill and we have small
children so she has to be on duty
24 hours a day as I am away all week.
As each helper works only eight hours,
you must send us three."
From the moment a woman has a
child in our modern society, she is
condemned to a working day which
never ends, and she often finds herself
suddenly isolated with her child from
the rest of society. Our economic
experts and politicians have done ,.
precisely nothing to find out how herr

Mother's 24-hour
working day
in the land
of the Midnight Sun
Mothers of young children who also
do a job outside the home are on call
24 hours a day. They have to look
after their children (right), keep the
home clean and tidy, make and mend
clothes, cook, do the washing, etc.
As for the housewife with no outside
job, she gets no pay and nobody has
ever calculated the value of her ?
household work in monetary terms.
Almost 600,000 women in Norway
(population 4 million), like the young
mother seen here consider working
in the home as their main occupation
(although many also work part-time
outside the home). Opposite page,

working day can be shortened and
made easier.
Furthermore, the only remedy they
can offer for her isolation (which may
eventually lead to a mental break¬
down), is to put her child into a
nursery school for 9 or 10 hours a day,
under exclusively female supervision,
and to offer her an additional job a
poorly paid one at that.
Why is it that children are increas¬
ingly regarded as an expensive and
superfluous burden, as a nuisance and
a problem? Are we not forgetting
that the world's future will be decided
by the chances of growth and devel¬
opment which we give to our children,
and by the values which we foster
in them?
As her children grow up, the mother
working in the home can move around
more freely. But even then she may
still have her hands full, doing things
which are vital to her family and to
the community.
She has time to look after others,
healthy and sick, young and old,
members of her family and others.
(At the end of 1972, we had In Norway
456,712 children under seven years of
age and room for only 19,000 of them
in day nurseries. There were 194,910
Norwegians aged 75 or over, but only
32,000 places in various old-age
institutions.)
She keeps her home, clothes,
furniture and linen in good repair to
avoid having to buy new things before
it is really necessary.
She buys material and wool In order
to make clothes and knitwear.
She obtains or produces food and,
if she lives on a farm, sows and reaps.
She joins study groups to make
herself better qualified.
She does social work in the local
community and persuades the local
authorities to give priority aid to
activities for the benefit of children,
teenagers and old people.
She is in fact, without realizing it,
a practising ecologist.
Women in all parts of the world
have much in common. More than
men, in my view.
For biological reasons we are unable
to escape life's deeper realities. We
are all faced with pregnancy, birth,
nursing, the daily care of children,
parents, friends, the sick and the old.
Attending to primary needs is first
and foremost our business, wherever
we live.
So why do we not protest loudly
when we are told that we are econ¬
omic burdens on our husbands? Why
do we not rise up in anger when people
call us an encumbrance on society,
because what we do adds nothing to
the Gross National Product? And, by
the way, why is it that they do not
increase the GNP?
It is sheer insolence to tell us that
we are not helping to build society nor
taking an active part in the develop¬
ment of our country. On the other
hand, I think we should rejoice when
people say that we are not playing
our part in building today's "brave new
world" of -technology ruled by com¬
puters.
Men in our modern society have
made themselves a gigantic play¬
ground and filled it with machinery,
money and finance, technological
subtleties, weapons, and intellectual
exaggerations.
Some women want nothing better
than to go into the male playground
and work under their orders. Today
our men try to entice all Norwegian
women into the playground because
they need manual helpers. But their
thinking is schizophrenic. They want
the women in their playground, but
they find it impossible to envisage their
homes without the "little woman".
Women who pack chocolates for
eight hours every day are said to be"
finding fulfilment by taking part in the
"inspiring process of production". In
some mysterious fashion, the word
"production" has become synonymous
with "paid work".

It is quite true that many of these
women do find fulfilment but not
through packing chocolates. They do
it by producing vital goods and
services in their own homes after
working hours, at night, on Saturdays
and Sundays and during the summer
holidays.
I can see no valid reason why we
should not calculate this productive
work in the home in terms of money.
All we need is to work out special
rates for pregnancy, child-birth, and
nursing and let's not forget that
human milk is a valuable food and
rates a high price.
We also need special overtime rates
for work over and above an 8-hour
day, as well as holiday pay and decent
wages for inconvenient working hours,
night work and work on Sundays, etc.
The bill would be astronomical.
And at long last our economic experts
would have to admit the reason why
women's work in the home has never
been valued in monetary terms:
although it can be calculated, there is
simply not enough money in the world
to pay for it.
A woman with four children once
told me that she had just passed a
university exam, and in the next breath
she described how she had just
mended 12 pairs of trousers. Her
pride in her mending was obviously
no less intense than her joy in having
passed the exam. To my mind this
woman has a real sense of values.
On the same day that I talked to
her, I read in the paper that computers
worth billions of kroner are thrown on
the scrap heap every year because
new and more advanced models come
on the market.
We know that the "development"
instigated by highly educated men in
the world's industrialized countries
has brought us all to the brink of
disaster. And to our eternal disgrace
we, the women of the world, have done
very little to stop them.
Men squander raw materials which
can never be replaced. They waste
good soil and turn it into sand and
asphalt. They jeopardize the food
supplies in the sea without which the
world's people cannot survive.
They are like drivers who back their
cars towards a precipice while staring
ahead through the windscreen. The
cars have not yet gone over the edge
because women have acted as brakes.
The many vital goods and services
women provide in the home do not
involve a large consumption of natural
resources. It is only «when women
step into the male playground and
accept men's values that they help to
impoverish the earth.
Two different cultural patterns seem
to be developing throughout the world,
one made and used by men and the
other by women. There is a real
conflict between the two, a silent
struggle between one set of values
connected with money, technology
and everything measured in terms of
"living standards" and another based
on meeting the fundamental physical
and mental needs we call the "quality
of life".
We, the women of the world, must
begin to use our heads. Let us start
thinking. Let us talk to our menfolk.
Let us step outside our homes and
make our men step outside their play¬
ground; let us meet as partners and
equals, listen and talk and work
together.
Let us find out together how we can
harmonize the cultural patterns of men
and women and make a common effort
to save the world our children will
inherit.

Where the husband
is head cook
and bottlewasher
by Elsa Rastad Braaten
THE United Nations has solemnly
declared that there shall be
equality between the sexes. But it is
one thing to talk about equality,
another to make it work in reality. For
you certainly can't change the present
position of women without affecting
the status of men. Men have so long
been used to accepting women as a
kind of ground crew, servicing the
male flight towards the upper heights
of society, that they will feel a little
"wing-clipped" if women withdraw their
services.
And what effect will this have on
their personality, their self respect,
and what they conceive as their mas¬
culine image ? Lots of men firmly
believe that masculinity dissolves in
dishwater. They would rather die than
be caught washing the baby's nappies.
ELSA RASTAD BRAATEN, a member of the
Norwegian parliament, has been active in the
Norwegian women's rights movement for
nearly 40 years. She has been an under¬
secretary of state to the Minister of Justice and
a consultant on women's employment to
Norway's Labour Directorate. A formerjournalist,
she was for some time editor of the women's
magazine published by the Norwegian Labour
Party.
Up to now women have been forced
to accept so-called equal opportunity
in working life on men's conditions.
They have had to meet the demands
of employers accustomed to the ser¬
vices of men who are supported by
housewives at home.
Women workers, on the other hand,
usually have the full responsibility of
home, husband and children in addi¬
tion to their paid jobs. Married women
especially with small children thus
take on a double work load when they
accept full-time work outside the home.
That is why many of them prefer part-
time work. So what becomes of equal
opportunity?
And what about the children ? If
both parents are working full time,
small children will certainly be deprived
of some of the affection and care to
which they are entitled. Yet at the
same time, the traditional family with
a mother at home all day and a father
out at work often means too much
mother and too little father.
The Family Council of Norway has
been anxiously following a situation
that seemed to be undermining the
family in modern industrial society. It
searched for a solution that in some
way would strengthen the family
within a framework of equality between
the sexes.
It was not so difficult to find the
answer in theory. If men and women
were to have equal opportunity outside
the home, they must also have the
same responsibility for home and
children. Full time work for both
parents had proved to be no solution
if they had small children. But, if part
time work was acceptable for women,
why not for men ? The idea was
reasonable, but would it work ?
In 1971, the Family Council, together
with the Institute of Sociology of the
University of Oslo, launched a research
experiment called "conjugal work-
sharing families".
The project was in two parts. First
it was necessary to create public
interest and get the support of workers
and employers. Secondly, research
was required to explore the causes
and motives that were leading families
to adopt the new pattern and to find
out what happened when they did.
A preliminary report on this exper¬
iment, published recently, shows that

"It's daddy's turn tonight". And why shouldn't fathers share responsibilities
in the home? In Norway some families have taken part in a "conjugal
work-sharing" experiment, husband and wife each taking part-time jobs
and arranging for one or the other to be always at home to look after
the children, do the housework, cooking, etc. Free of adult prejudices,
children are quite happy to have a father who's good at nursing, cooking,
dusting and other home chores.
conjugal work-sharing is at least a
possible way of life.
The couples taking part could share
their working time as suited them best.
The ortly condition was that neither
the husband nor the wife should work
away from home more than 28 hours
or /ess' than 16 hours a week. They
had to synchronise their work-hours
so that one of them would always be
at home. \
There were of course some diffi¬
culties. At first it was rather hard to
get employers to accept a man part-
time. It didn't seem right to them
that a well educated man should prefer
to stay at home half the time to do
housework and look after children
when he had a wife who in their view
could do it better!
About 25 families agreed to partici¬
pate in the experiment, but only
16 were able to get suitable part-time
work for both parents. In most of the
families, both parents occupied posts
such as teachers, nurses, dentists,
lawyers and so on.
The women usually earned less than
the men, so the family income generally
went down. This is probably one of
the reasons why working class parents
were less interested: they simply
couldn't afford the drop in income.
Surprisingly enough, equality be¬
tween the sexes was not the main
consideration of the majority of those
taking part in the experiment, though,
of course, it did count to some extent.
The parents mostly felt that the
children needed more attention, es¬
pecially from the father.
One of the couples who opened
their home life to public scrutiny was
Aud and Svein Fjelland in Bergen.
Both agree that for them, at least, the
arrangement turned out well. They
have more time together and share
more interests, which has enriched
their married life.
The children love having a father,
as well as a mother, to help with the
school work, someone who is an
expert bun, cake and bread baker,
who knows how to blow on a bruised
knee so it doesn't hurt any more and
a lot of other tricks that usually only
a mother is supposed to know about.
Svein Fjelland says that part-time
employment has forced him to accept
work that is a bit below his qualifi
cations he has a Master's degree
from a business school and that his
career will probably suffer. But he
thinks his wife and children are more
important.
The new way of life also gives him
more time for community activities.
He doesn't feel less respected as a
male, in spite of being accepted as
a member of the local Housewives
Clubl Aud Fjelland perhaps has met
with more disapproval. She has been
accused of selfishness because say
some people she lets her husband's
career suffer to make life more
comfortable for herself. More often,
however, friends say they envy the
couple their courage in trying out
something new.
The report shows that most of the
conjugal work-sharing families had
similar experiences to the Fjellands.
On the one hand they noted a mild
curiosity and envy among their friends,
a little hostility among a few who feel
threatened by a change of the familiar
life-style, and difficulties in finding
suitable jobs; and on the other, better
marital relations and happier children.

Masculine
feminine
or neutral ?
AN extremely important problem
related to the profound changes
which have occurred in Soviet, society
is raised in this letter (on right) which
appeared recently in the Moscow
literary review "Litteraturnaia Gazeta".
The access of women to equality
with men raises a whole series of
problems. For example, having won
equal rights and freedom in what
direction should women develop their
personality?
In her letter, Madame Lvova is in
fact claiming that there should be no
distinctions between women and men
at work, in social life or in the family,
that boys and girls should be brought
up in exactly the same way and that
equality of rights implies identical
behaviour and outlook In men and
women.
But opinion in many countries has
been seriously disturbed in recent
years by an increasing tendency for
men to become "feminized" and for
women to become "masculinized".
The legal equality of the sexes, the
radical changes which have occurred
in the professional, social and family
life of men and women, the growing
tendency to apply the same standards
of morality and conduct to men and
women, and finally a certain "hybrid"
character in the physical appearance
of many persons all create the im¬
pression that the distinction between
the "stronger" and the "weaker" sex
is becoming blurred, a situation which
causes heated controversy and some
alarm.
Where are these changes in our
civilization leading us? Are we, in
fact, witnessing the disappearance of
ARON 1SAAKOVICH BELKIN, an inter¬
nationally-known Soviet scientist, is head of the
psychiatric endocrinology laboratory at the
Moscow Institute of Psychiatry (Ministry of
Public Health of the Russian Federation). He
is the author of over 60 studies on problems of
psychiatric endocrinology.
" If the word ' emancipation ' nowadays elicits a sceptical smile it is
because as a concept it has so many inherent contradictions. What do sta¬
tistics tell us about it in their unemotional language? That in 1969, for
instance, there were 62 times more women with higher and specialized
secondary education in the U.S.S.R. than there were in 1928 : 9,500,000 wo¬
men altogether or 60 per cent of all graduates from those levels of education.
There have been many changes in the status of women, and yet something
is still lacking... I believe that women are psychologically unprepared for
the rights and freedoms which have been heaped on them.
Centuries of oppression have given women a mistaken view of their
own abilities which by the force of inertia still survives in the consciousness
of women today. It is time that women took stock of their new social status.
But how are they to do this?
Education, environment, books and works of art, as we know, play an
important role in the awakening and development of the human mind.
Women must therefore be given, from their early childhood, the kind of
moral training that will prepare them for the immense social changes that
have taken place in our country.
But so far, the education of girls has been characterized by an inertia that
persists with astonishing tenacity. Parents themselves instil in their daugh¬
ters specific attitudes which explain the gap that opens in later life bet¬
ween the basic aspirations of men and women.
Upbringing exerts an enormous influence on a woman's life and I believe
that if girls were guided correctly in developing a proper sense of values
all the arguments about the influence of women's biological characteristics
on their psychological make-up would be shown up as baseless. Polish
sociologists have concluded that feminine psychological characteristics,
to the extent that they actually exist, are more the result of cultural factors
than of inborn, sex-related ones. They result primarily from the way girls
are brought up, and this in turn depends to a large extent on society's concept
of the role of women."
N. Lvova
(Irom a letter to the Moscow "Litteraturnaia Gazeta")
the lines of demarcation between male
and female psychology and behaviour?
Obviously one should first consider
the nature of the psychological differ¬
ences between men and women. Are
they purely biological in origin or are
they caused entirely by social factors?
Would identical upbringing for both
sexes really disprove all the theories
about the influence of the biological
characteristics of women on female
psychology?
In the course of biological evolution,
many species have developed a
division into sexes which presents a
number of important advantages from
the point of view of adaptation to the
environment and of survival. These
advantages are not merely a matter

In 1974, 20 million children in the Soviet Union spent their summer vacations
in nursery schools or holiday camps at the seaside or in the country.
These facilities are a tremendous boon to mothers in a country such as
the U.S.S.R. where 51 per cent of industrial and office workers are women.

( ranee, in behaviour and in "character"
' have become firmly established.
In the case of human beings,
masculine and feminine roles are of
course determined not so much by
biological factors as by social, econ¬
omic and cultural ones. But this does
not mean that today any more than in
the past, the nature of men's and
women's social roles can be changed
at will: they are based upon biological
foundations, and any failure to take
this fundamental truth into account
could have serious consequences.
The shaping of the individual per¬
sonality is closely linked with the un¬
conscious choice of a particular pattern
of conduct, a choice which the child
makes under the influence of those
around him.
To begin with, the child merely
imitates certain of the outward charac¬
teristics of the person whom he has
involuntarily chosen as a "model",
such psychological characteristics as
kindness, gentleness, responsiveness
or determination, courage and firmness.
Stereotypes of behaviour accepted
for the sex of the child are encouraged
and those which are not accepted are
discouraged: boys, for instance, are
shamed out of crying, while girls
are told off for tomboyish behaviour.
It has been shown that parents,
particularly the mother, unconsciously
adopt a different attitude to a baby
boy or girl right from its birth.
Research in the United States has
shown that in the first six months
mothers hold and handle sons con¬
siderably more often than daughters.
But after the period in which baby
boys are frequently fondled, mothers
try to wean them away. A year-old
girl is allowed' to spend much more
time with her mother and comes into
physical contact with her more often
than a boy of the same age.
As this lessening of the contact with
the mother increases the independence
of a child, researchers have concluded
that mothers intuitively try to develop
such Independence in their sons,
encouraging them to explore and
"master" the world around them.
But why does a child choose a
particular model of male or female
conduct? The' answer is that the
child's reactions depend on its bio¬
logical characteristics. A child chooses
the father or the mother as its model
primarily according to whether a
masculine or a feminine role comes
more easily to it.
This "principle of facility" is ex¬
tremely important in the choice by an
individual of a particular social role,
since it demonstrates that the role
in question corresponds with the
individual's natural characteristics. A
boy, for instance, may dream of
becoming a boxer but if by nature
he is highly sensitive to pain he will
soon give up this impossible ambition.
The same thing happens in the
choice of a sexual role. The ease
with which the individual can accept
his role depends on a biological pre¬
disposition, further reinforced by the
influence of the social environment.
The child thus gradually comes to feel
that it belongs to one or other of the
sexes, works out a particular type
of conduct and becomes definitively
aware of its own identity as a man
or woman.
Biologically speaking, human beings
are born either men or women, but
socially speaking they become men
or women through their contacts with
other people and under the influence
of society. Every social role which an
individual takes upon himself burdens
him with a heavy responsibility
towards society, which calls for con¬
siderable effort on his part if he is to
fulfil that role successfully.
It may be that those who vocifer¬
ously demand a single "identity" for
the sexes, or who call for a "sexual
revolution" and for freedom from daily
routine are merely demonstrating a
selfish and irresponsible desire to
escape from the role which nature and
society assign to every individual.
For many centuries the belief has
been firmly held that the psychology
and behaviour of girls and boys
should be different. The fact that this
conviction is now being reappraised
creates serious consequences both
for the individual and for society as
a whole.
Attempts by parents to "transform"
their sons into daughters or to make
little girls out of boys lead to equally
unfortunate results. Research shows
that mothers who have never played
with dolls during childhood often lack
motherly feelings and maternal skills,
while boys who have been pampered
grow up physically weak, cowardly
and dependent. When they reach
adulthood, such children often prove
incapable of fulfilling the role which
society requires of them.
In many modern families, the roles
of man and woman have become so
indistinguishable, the demarcation lines
between them so unclear, that a child
has no possibility of choice between
different models of behaviour. The
¡mages of the strong, brave, strict,
determined father and the tender,
gentle, understanding mother have
become blurred and indistinct. Which
of them should the child imitate?
With whom should it identify? The
problem has become so complex, as
we have personally seen from many
cases, that by no means all children
are able to find an answer.
Another aspect of the difficulties
that boys and girls today have in
establishing their own sexual identity
is the gradual, inexorable disappear¬
ance from the lore of children of
fairytales, nursery rhymes, etc., which
used to help them to build up a mental
ideal of masculine or feminine charac¬
teristics to which they could aspire.
In most modern poems, stories and
songs for children the conduct of
heroes and heroines is often indis¬
tinguishable, and the child's deep need
to set up an ideal of masculinity or
femininity is left unsatisfied.
Differences in psychology and behav¬
iour between men and women are thus
becoming less distinct with every
generation, and there is every reason
to fear that this process will continue.
Modern science has now sufficient
evidence to show beyond doubt that
a feeling of one's own sexual identity
as a man or a woman is an essential
attribute of one's personality and the
person lacking this is incapable of
leading a normal life in society.

Today doctors have unfortunately
to deal more and more frequently with
people who for one reason or another
have to some extent lost this feeling
of identity. The study of such cases
shows quite clearly that any voluntary
or involuntary psychological deviation
from the sense of belonging to one
or the other sex can lead to serious
psychological disturbance, to severe
pathological troubles and ultimately
to tragic consequences.
Loss of this sense of belonging
brings about profound changes in the
whole personality, along with symp¬
toms of "depersonalization". The
individual Is no longer sure of his place
in society. His whole system of
relations with others is disturbed and
he loses his sense of attachment to
friends and relatives, to familiar places,
to his work and to life itself.
The intolerable feeling of "sex-
lessness" expresses itself in anti¬
social behaviour such as alcoholism,
drug-taking and homosexuality. This
in turn creates bitterness and emotion¬
al instability that are sometimes re¬
sponsible for crime and for unhappy,
broken lives that not infrequently end
in suicide.
These misadventures, of course,
threaten above all those who have
suffered a profound disturbance of the
sense of sexual identity. Such cases
are relatively rare, but there are many
others in which similar symptoms are
present In a milder form.
There are of course no simple or
ready-made solutions to the problem.
Many contradictory ideas and preju¬
dices have emerged in the course of
human history concerning the signifi¬
cance of sexual awareness in the
shaping of human character, and many
are the problems that science still has
to solve ¡n this field.
One thing is certain, however:
equality of the sexes should not lead
to the blurring of the psycho¬
logical boundaries between them, to
"asexual" behaviour. The best guaran¬
tee of harmony in sexual relations is
the recognition that the natural roles
of the sexes are distinctive and
different, not identical.
For centuries the need to restrain
the sexual urge was propagated by
society, but no attention was paid to
the significance of sexual awareness
in the development of the human
personality. Today science must
contribute to the urgent task of
investigating the true laws governing
sexual behaviour.

The situation of women
in 12 socialist countries
An international seminar held in Moscow on the eve of International Wo¬
men's Year brought together representatives of women's organizations from
12 socialist countries. The discussions focussed on women's participation
in productive work. The article published below is based on the conclusions
of the seminar.
THE degree of women's eman¬
cipation is a criterion of general
emancipation", wrote the great French
Utopian Charles Fourier (1772-1837).
But long before Fourier phrased this
fundamental principle, others had af¬
firmed that women should have equal
rights with men in every sphere of
human activity, since discrimination
against women retards human pro¬
gress.
i
This is even more true today when
one-third of all the material wealth
essential for human existence is pro¬
duced by women.
Although women's rights are written
into the constitutions of the majority
of countries or stipulated by law, inter¬
national experience shows that the
proclamation of equality does not
necessarily mean its implementation.
Only an active participation of women
in productive work can ensure their
full and genuine equality with men.
This viewpoint was reaffirmed by
representatives of women's organi¬
zations from twelve countries (1) who
took part in a seminar on the parti¬
cipation of women in productive work,
held in Moscow on the eve of Inter¬
national Women's Year.
Speakers at the seminar described
how governments in their respective
countries are working to create condi¬
tions which enable women to take
regular jobs outside the home while
still being able to care for their chil¬
dren and do housework.
This probably explains why nearly
half of all industrial and office workers
in these countries are women : 45 per
cent in Bulgaria and Romania, 46 per
cent in Poland, 48.5 per cent in
Czechoslovakia, 50 per cent in the
Korean People's Democratic Republic
and 51 per cent in the U.S.S.R.
The number of women workers is
increasing in all parts of the world,
but in the twelve socialist countries the
proportion of women holding paid jobs
is particularly high while the number
of women contributing to economic
growth and engaged in studies is espe¬
cially impressive: 84.5 per cent in
the German Democratic Republic,
85.6 per cent in Czechoslovakia and
92.5 per cent in the U.S.S.R.
These figures show that for women
work is not only an economic neces¬
sity it is increasingly becoming a

moral requirement (to be useful to
society). A recent sociological survey
in the U.S.S.R. revealed that 30 per
cent of the women polled gave this
as their primary reason for working
and about 67 per cent had both eco¬
nomic and moral motivations.
This difference of opinion as regards
motivation is explained by the diver¬
sity, in terms of education, profes¬
sional training, jobs and also family
status, of working women. And this
in turn accounts for other problems,
of which perhaps the most serious is
the extent to which women lag behind
men in professional skills.
Women's social role as workers
and mothers indeed reveals a certain
contradiction.
Professional training and skills are
usually acquired between the ages
of 20 and 30. But it is generally
between these ages that women bear
children and raise families and so
have to leave work, which means that
they also begin to lose their pro¬
fessional skills.
So in this context it is especially
important to make the right approach
to the professional orientation of
women. Though they are equals,
socially and economically, men and
women have basic psychological dif¬
ferences, which must be considered
when choosing an occupation.
The Moscow seminar stressed that
professional orientation should aim
not merely to provide equal job op¬
portunities for men and women, that
is, their "equal representation" in
every occupation, but should see to
it that women are given jobs for which
qualifications and pay are the same as
those of men.
Some jobs, though well paid, are
hard and unhealthy and cannot be
done by women for physical and phy¬
siological reasons. The code of female
labour and motherhood in the twelve
socialist countries prohibits the em¬
ployment of women for this kind of
job, although this entails no discri¬
mination in remuneration, and wages
are fixed according to the quantity,
quality and value of work done.
In all 12 countries, it was stressed
at the seminar, measures to exclude
the possibility of discrimination start
with access to general education, in
which the principle of equality is
strictly applied. Girls usually make
up 50 per cent or more of the chil¬
dren enrolled in schools.
Out of every thousand Soviet work¬
ing women 717 have higher, second¬
ary or partial secondary education.
The figure for men is 718 so there is
no gap between the sexes in terms
of the average level of education.
In Poland, 48 per cent of women
have had higher, secondary or partial
secondary education, in Bulgaria 51.6
per cent and in Czechoslovakia,
54.2 per cent.
At the turn of the present century
it was not easy for women to enter
the medical profession. Today from
50 to 85 per cent of medical and
nursing staffs in the twelve socialist
countries are women.
In Mongolia, for instance, all women
were illiterate before 1928. Today
women make up 24.5 per cent of the
country's specialists with higher edu¬
cation, 37.6 per cent of all persons
with a secondary education and 50
per cent of those with technical secon¬
dary education.
The gap between "men's" and
"women's" jobs has narrowed sharply. ^

^ in all socialist countries. In the
U.S.S.R., heavy industry is now staffed
largely by women, while light industry,
traditionally a women's sector, now
ranks just below it. Women today
make up between 65 and 67 per cent
of workers in the machine-engineering
industry and electronics and 77 per
cent of workers on automatic assembly
lines in industrial plants.
Women's work does not interfere
seriously with their being mothers,
thanks to a system of law under which
mothers receive benefits that in some
instances are considerably above
the standards laid down by ILO
conventions.
In Bulgaria, the German Democratic
Republic, Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and the U.S.S.R., periods of mater¬
nity leave range from 3 to 6 months,
and women there are entitled to ad¬
ditional leave In order to care for
their babies.
Thus, in Hungary, in addition to a
20-week maternity leave, a woman is
entitled to additional leave for baby-
care, during which she receives one-
third of her pay for 30 months. In the
Korean People's Democratic Republic
women with more than two children
receive a full day's pay for only six
hours' work.
The participation of women in work¬
ing life, as the Moscow seminar
stressed, promotes their cultural ad¬
vancement, increases their qualifi¬
cations and raises them to a new posi¬
tion in society. More than half a mil¬
lion Soviet women are In charge of
factories or collective farms and wom¬
en occupy 32 per cent of senior posts
as managers and heads of departments
in industrial plants.
Women's professional work is one
criterion of their participation in the
political life of their countries. In
Czechoslovakia, for instance, 24 per
cent of government officials are wom¬
en, in the Democratic Republic of
Vietnam about 30 per cent and in the
U.S.S.R. 31.3 per cent.
Of course it is not statistics alone
which count, although they help to
give a general idea of women's status
in the socialist countries, where their
equality with men, as seminarspeakers
pointed out, enables them to play a
truly active part in society.
But figures do reveal, the particular
nature of social and economic devel¬
opment in these countries, each of
which is distinguished by its own ap¬
proach to the problem of women's
employment.
Speakers at the Moscow seminar
expressed the hope that International
Women's Year will mark the beginning
of concerted efforts to achieve equal¬
ity for women in all countries, to
ensure their participation in economic,
social and cultural development and
to enhance their role in promoting
world peace.

Non-governmental organizations
and the struggle
for women's emancipation

Canadian Cultural Centre, Paris
IN^ its March 1975 issue, the
Tlnesco Courier" published a
brief chronology of milestones in the
emancipation of women, which listed
some of the women's organizations
founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Inspired and led by women whose
names hold an honoured place in the
history of some countries, these organ¬
izations campaigned for wide-ranging
or specific objectives, drawing women
into a global and irreversible movement
whose definitive history has still to be
written.
Women's organizations owe their
existence to a number of special
circumstances. One was the right, only
then recently accorded in some count¬
ries, to form associations. Another
was the extension of education to
women in a widening range of social
classes and occupations.
Industrialization was a third and de¬
cisive factor. Until the 19th century
women's activities were largely confin¬
ed to the family circle; they helped
run the family business or farm, bar¬
tering or selling their produce locally.
Industrialization and the development
of a market economy reduced the
role of women as producers of goods
for local consumption and led them
to seek work outside the restricted
family group, and to earn money to
pay for some of their household needs.
Thus, the demands put forward by
a handful of highly educated women
were gradually taken up step by step
by others grappling with new problems
and social and economic handicaps.
One can say that every new activity
JEANNE HENRIETTE CHATON, of France,
has played a leading part In the work of many
international women's organizations, including
the International Council of Women, the Inter¬
national Federation of Business and Professional
Women and the International Federation of
University Women, of which she was President
from 1953 to 1956. A member of the French
committee for International Women's Year, she
has also represented France on the United
Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
A history teacher, she was a consultant to
Unesco for its programme on the equal access
of girls and women to education between 1949
and 1952.
undertaken by women, howeverlimited,
has demonstrated the need for women's
organizations and the work they do.
The foundation of the League of
Nations after World War I was a land¬
mark in the development of women's
organizations. It encouraged them to
make international contacts and gave
them an opportunity to make known
their views to the League's specialized
committees dealing with women's
questions.
The League also heard proposals
for banning, in any form whatever,
"the sale or trade in women and child¬
ren, either for work or prostitution, or
even marriage" but it failed to approve
the proposals at that time.
Thus, following the foundation of
the League of Nations, international
women's organizations became in¬
creasingly active in the League's var¬
ious social, humanitarian and econ¬
omic committees. Joining forces, their
delegates presented petitions in sup¬
port of peace and disarmament and
made direct appeals to heads of gov¬
ernments.
These activities, at meetings of the
League and of the International Labour
Office in Geneva and of the Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation in Paris,
led to the foundation of still more
international women's organizations.
But World War II disrupted their
work, even though they tried, often
at great risk, to keep their internatio¬
nal links alive and to aid war victims
and refugees.
As soon as the conflict ended,
women's organizations showed their
readiness to play a still more important
role in helping to repair the ravages
of war.
Their eagerness to play a full part
in the post-war world was recognized
at the San Francisco Conference
(1945), which, in drawing up the Char¬
ter of the United Nations, made pro¬
vision for the U.N. Economic and So¬
cial Council to work with non-govern¬
mental organizations on a consultative
basis. Since then, many women's asso-.
dations have been given consultative r

^ status with the U.N. and its agencies,
including Unesco.
International women's organizations
have played a growing part in pro¬
moting international solidarity and un¬
derstanding, and as membership of the
United Nations has increased so has
their influence and importance.
The World Association of Girl Gui¬
des and Girl Scouts, for instance,
today groups 90 national organizations
and 6.5 million members covering
every continent. The International
Alliance of Women has branches in
nine African, eight Latin American,
11 -Asian and 14 European countries
as well as in the United States and
Australia. The Associated Country
Women of the World has 8 million
members in 69 countries. The World
Union of Catholic Women's Organi¬
zations has 125 affiliated associations.
All these women's organizations
are voluntary and non-governmental
bodies. They are financed by members'
dues and occasional gifts or legacies,
but they rarely receive large subsidies.
All have affirmed their determination
to contribute to the maintenance of
peace and world understanding and
to the fundamental freedoms laid down
in the U.N. Charter and the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights.
Some of the women's groups which
are concerned with the overall problem
of women's status in the world have
focussed their activities on education,
job training and family welfare as well
as on economic, civic and political
problems. They have also worked to
improve the conditions of the world's
poorest and most neglected peoples.
One of these, the World Young Wom¬
en's Christian Association (founded
in 1894) operates in many parts of
the world. It provides emergency and
long-term aid to refugees in areas
with acute refugee problems, such as
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Middle East,
Pakistan, Hong Kong and Mauritius.
It also helps immigrants to adjust
to their new surroundings by running
literacy courses in the language of
their host country, provides job train¬
ing, helps to integrate refugees
into the community, regularises the
situations of illegal immigrants and,
when necessary, helps those who wish
to return to their country of origin.
The Associated Country Women of
the World (founded in 1930) tackles
the same problems in rural areas by
training women teachers for widely
scattered farming communities. It has
launched literacy programmes in
Indonesia, Brazil, Trinidad and East
Africa, and it provides basic training in
farming, market gardening and stock-
raising. It shows people how
best to use local resources and how to
combat vitamin deficiencies and also
teaches about sanitation, family plan¬
ning and care of children.
The major goal of the International
Alliance of Women (founded in 1888),
whose motto is "Equal rights, equal
responsibilities", is to show women
what they must do in order to achieve
equality in law and in daily life. Its
special concerns are problems of em¬
ployment, health, family, social welfare,
rural development, living conditions in
cities, and education.
The International Council of Women
(also founded in 1888) operates on
similar lines. In countries such as
Nepal, Pakistan, Cameroon and Peru,
it has helped women group-leaders in
rural areas to carry out literacy cam¬
paigns and community development
and training courses, with the help of
Unesco's Gift Coupon Programme or
through its own project contracts.
Associations of women of the same
religious faith, such as the World
Union of Catholic Women's Organiza¬
tions (founded in 1910) or the Inter¬
national Council of Jewish Women
(founded in 1912 it ceased its activi¬
ties during the two world wars, and
was restarted in 1949) do not re¬
strict their work to persons of their
retraining and helps members who
have emigrated.
The International Federation of Busi¬
ness and Professional Women (found¬
ed in 1930) working with a wide variety
of professional groups also seeks to
improve women's professional qualifi¬
cations. In developing countries car¬
eers are now opening up for women
which call for specialized training
notably in legal and economic fields.
These careers are -related to priority
activities such as family welfare, con¬
servation of the environment and the
development of marketing and trade.
The International Council of Social
Democratic Women (founded in 1955)
promotes contacts between women's
organizations in the social democratic
movement in over 30 countries, sup¬
porting their efforts to achieve equality
between the sexes.
Two clubs working in conjunction
with Unesco have similar aims. They

own faith, although they aim to main¬
tain fundamental religious values.
Their objectives are to protect women
children and young people and to en¬
sure their moral welfare.
The World Union of Catholic Wo¬
men's Organizations is particularly
active in Venezuela, Colombia and
Mexico. Besides promoting literacy
and technological development, Catho¬
lic and Jewish women's groups alike
are engaged in the struggle against
economic and social injustice.
The Women's International Demo¬
cratic Federation (founded in 1945) is
concerned primarily with the problems
of women as mothers, workers, and
citizens. It works to promote peace,
accession to national independence
and better living conditions and also to
combat hunger.
The International Federation of Uni¬
versity Women (founded in 1919) stri¬
ves to bring women greater access
to higher education, more posts in
basic and applied research and jobs of
greater responsibility. In developing
countries it promotes the growth of
education so that women can have
access to the further studies that open
the way to better jobs. It provides
many grants for studies, research and
are the Soroptimist International Asso¬
ciation (founded in 1928) and Zonta
International, whose name is derived
from a Sioux Indian word meaning
"honest and trustworthy".
A number of organizations are in fact
open to both men and women; trade
unions, for instance have large num¬
bers of women members. In the early
days of trade unionism, women were
either rejected outright or only reluc¬
tantly accepted as members, but since
then they have actively participated in
worker's organizations including those
which have consultative status with
Unesco. The same is true for some
professional bodies (teachers, lawyers
and others).
So long as discrimination exists, so
long as world opinion has not con¬
demned and abolished discrimination
both in theory and in practice, the
need for women's associations and
their world-wide action will remain.
The proof that they are needed is
shown by the fact that the United
Nations and its specialized agencies
so frequently call on women's orga¬
nizations to help them carry out their
programmes.

The first
world conference
of women
FROM June 19 to July 2, 1975, the
United Nations-sponsored World
Conference of International Women's
Year took place in Mexico City.
Attended by more than 8,000 women
representing 133 countries and 113
non-governmental organizations, the
immense gathering was an unparalleled
event in the history of the struggle for
women's rights, by the number and
standing of the delegates, the range of
issues they discussed and the keen
controversy revealed by some of the
debates.
An event which drew global attention
(some 1,200 journalists from every
continent were in Mexico City to report
on its deliberations) the conference
naturally gave rise to some criticism
and misgivings, and even drew some
sarcastic comments, but everywhere
it aroused great interest.

general political discussions which took
place in Mexico City?
This first world conference on the
status of women showed, not un¬
surprisingly, that it could not escape,
to some extent, reflecting the tensions
that affect the life of the entire world
community: the problems posed by
racialism and apartheid, by the gap
between poor and rich countries, the
problems of armed conflict, of peace
and disarmament, human rights, the
creation of a new world economic
order, the population explosion, etc.

between men and women, the inte¬
gration of women into development
and the promotion of peace without
also taking into consideration these
major world problems and their conse¬
quences for women?
But something more than social and
political commitment by women is
needed if effective campaigns are to
be waged against the countless forms
of discrimination of which women are
still the victims and against which all
women in the world must be protected.
Drawing
"One difficulty in carrying out a plan of action for women's liberation is
that men occupy all the top posts at the decision-making level."
The Mexico City conference drew up
and adopted a 10-year World Plan of
Action, a Declaration of principles and
34 resolutions which form an un¬
precedented set of guidelines and
targets for action to improve the
status of women, comprising a wide
variety of clearly-defined and practical
measures to be taken in all fields
affecting women, at national, regional,
and international levels.
The Plan vigorously reaffirms that
the objective of International Women's
Year is to build a society in which
women can fully participate in a real
and full sense in economic, social and
political life. It urges governments to
ensure for both women and men
equality before the law, equal access
to education, job training and employ¬
ment as well as the right to equal
conditions of employment, including
pay and adequate social security.
Among other steps towards a more
equitable society, the Plan of Action
stresses the need for the establish¬
ment of a new international economic
order as envisaged in the U.N. General
Assembly's declaration of May 1974.
Many proposals deal with specifi¬
cally feminist demands and problems
of the family. The basic condition of
any real equality between the sexes,
affirms the Plan of Action, is the right
of individuals and couples "to deter¬
mine the number and spacing of their
children and to receive all the infor¬
mation and the means to do so."
In retrospect, the texts, resolutions
and proposals emanating from the
conference on the major problems of
improving women's status will increas¬
ingly be seen as an achievement
whose long-term effects will mark a
turning point in history.
Parallel to the conference itself, an
International Women's Year "Tribune"
was successfully organized in Mexico
City by non-governmental organ¬
izations. Attended by nearly 6,000
women, from every kind of organ¬
ization, it was a forum of wide-ranging
and lively debates and produced a host
of ideas and proposals.
This raises the question of how the
ideas which came out of the unofficial
Tribune can be applied in practice to
help solve the many problems of
women's rights. It is inconceivable
that such vigour and momentum should
fail to produce positive results, even ^

(.though it did not find adequate means
of expression during the conference
and among governments and inter¬
national organizations.
And how, for that matter, will the
Plan of Action be implemented? For
every plan of this kind tends to pose
the same problem: how can govern¬
ments and groups of all kinds be
persuaded to carry out recommen¬
dations drawn up at an international
level which are not legally binding?
A big effort will be needed to ensure
that countries incorporate into their
national policies and programmes the
maximum number of these international
recommendations.
The difficulties involved in im¬
plementing any world plan of action
are even greater when it comes to
improving the status of women owing
to the fact that the top posts at the
decision-making level are usually held
by men.
Another question of fundamental
importance concerns the concept of
the family, its size and its role in
society, and what is nowadays
referred to either as "responsible
parenthood" or "family planning".
Discussions at the conference re¬
vealed many divergencies on this
question, so that final decisions are
still left to the discretion of each
government. This is seen as a defeat;
for a great many women it is a bitter
disappointment and it will be a serious
handicap in the years ahead.
Another world conference for Inter¬
national Women's Year will meet in
East Berlin (German Democratic Re¬
public) from October 20 to 24, 1975,
organized by the Women's International
Democratic Federation. Once again
thousands of women will take part and
it will be interesting to see how they
react to the results obtained and the
problems raised by the Mexico City
conference.
At all events, the Mexico City
conference has been a pioneering
achievement and it can be hoped that
the East Berlin congress, the second
outstanding event of International
Women's Year, will serve to develop
and complete its work.
Marie-Pierre Herzog
$ 65 million penalty for sexist discrimination
operators are women and all telephone
repair staff are men (usually earning
much higher salaries) this is con¬
sidered proof that the telephone com¬
pany practises discrimination. Sex dis¬
crimination is permitted only in those
positions where sex is a bona fide
occupational qualification; and offi¬
cials have suggested that about the
only positions where sex is such a
bona fide qualification are those of
sperm donor and wet nurse.
If a company is found guilty of dis¬
crimination or if it wishes to avoid
such a possibility, or if it is a federal
contractor, it must draw up an "Affir¬
mative Action Program" showing not
only how discrimination will be elimi¬
nated in the future, but how it intends
to correct the results of past discri¬
mination.
This may mean recruitment of women
machinists in a higher proportion
than the general average, or it may
mean company training programmes
for women so that they may be promo¬
ted " to higher company positions,
rarely occupied by women. The action
programme must include goals and
timetables.
Some companies found guilty of
discrimination have been faced with
expensive payments. For example, in
one key action against a telephone
company, approximately $15 million
back pay was given to women and
minority groups considered to have
suffered from discriminatory employ¬
ment practices; and an additional
$50 million in yearly payments for
promotion and wage adjustments to
minority and female employees was
ordered. Recently the same company
was ordered to pay even more for
failing to comply with earlier agree¬
ments to end employment discrimi¬
nation.
Companies and universities receiving
federal contracts may find their govern¬
ment contracts held up until an appro¬
priate action programme is presented.
Women were perhaps extremely
lucky that the word "sex" was slipped
into the Civil Rights Act; but their
benefits from it would have been
minimal had they relied on luck alone.
When people finally realized that
sex discrimination was prohibited by
Title VII, they first tended to regard it
as a joke, and even the Equal Employ¬
ment Opportunity Commission didn't
take women very seriously in the 1960s,
feeling that its main job was to elimin¬
ate discrimination against minority
groups.
Women, however, began to realize
that they could make Title VII work
for them. An investigation by the
commission cannot be started until a
complaint is filed by someone actually
interested in the job in question. The
women's movement thus set out to
help women file their complaints.
Groups such as the National Organ¬
ization of Women trained members to
act as employment counsellors, to
show more women where and how to
file and to give them moral support
during the long process, particularly
if they faced (illegal) harassment.
Moreover, the commission's tremen¬
dous backlog of complaints often
means a delay of two years or more
between filing a complaint and an
investigation. Employment counsellors
have tried to speed up this process in
individual cases, for example by filing
complaints with the state and local
agencies, which have tended to act
more rapidly.
The women's movement has been
active in other ways, such as organ¬
izing demonstrations against some
companies where discrimination was
most blatant; and it made a cause
célèbre of a Southern woman who
filed a complaint because a telephone
company had denied her a job as a
switchwoman.
The movement has also seen to it
that women are included in other
legislation pertaining to equal employ¬
ment opportunity. The commission is
criticized on the one hand for not doing
enough and on the other for doing too
much. In spite of a significant
(Continued from page 33)
strengthening of the commission in
1972, women's groups still say it
is too weak, and that the backlog of
complaints, with the consequent
delays, is so large as to make it
unworkable.
But universities and businesses don't
like to be told whom they can hire, and
they object to the arbitrariness of some
of the quotas they must fill. Further¬
more, if quotas are set for the
hiring of Negroes, Women, Spanish
Americans, Asians, and American
Indians, other minority groups wonder
why they, too, cannot have a quota.
Women's suffrage had many links
with the emancipation of the Negro in
American history, but Negroes, who
once again find themselves bracketed
with women, feel that women are
reaping greater benefits than they are.
White males just entering the job
market feel that they suffer from
reverse discrimination, as companies
try to meet their quotas of women and
minority groups, although the president
of one American company has said
"what the white male is losing is not
opportunity, but the favoured place he's
held over the years in relation to that
opportunity."
While it is still too early to evaluate
the long-term effects of Title VII and
other acts that prohibit sex discrimi¬
nation in employment, it would seem
that, just as today's women's move¬
ment has pushed for enforcement and
expansion of the law, the law has in
turn benefitted women.
The refusal of federal legislation to
recognize "male" and "female" jobs,
has opened new occupations, with
their promotional and pay benefits, to
women, many of whom would have
never applied for such work because
nothing in their experience or education
suggested that a woman could do it.
And the woman who knows what she
wants is no longer totally powerless
when told "We don't hire women for
this job."

International
Fair Play awards
The international Pierre de Coubertln
Fair Play awards for 1974 were presented
to the Swiss karate competitor Claude
Ravonel and to the Romanian discus-
thrower Lia Manoliu at a ceremony in
Unesco House on June 6, 1975. Claude
Ravonel's award was made because he
refused to benefit from a mistake by an
opponent on which he could have demanded
a disqualification penalty. Lia Manoliu was
honoured for the sporting spirit she has
displayed throughout her career. Diplomas
of honour were awarded to the national
football teams of the Federal German
Republic and the German Democratic Re¬
public and to the British pentathlon competi¬
tor Jeremy Fox. Presenting the awards,
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow recalled that Unesco's
Member States are to hold the first
conference of ministers of physical edu¬
cation and sport in March 1976 to examine
the place that should be given to these
subjects in and out of school.
World Environment Day 1975
World Environment Day, June 5, was
created by the U.N. General Assembly in
1972 as a means of focussing world
attention on the state of the global environ¬
ment and the risks posed by man's
activities. The theme for 1975, "Human
Settlements", spotlights problems of the
man-made environment in which some
60 per cent of an estimated world popu¬
lation of 6.5 billion may be living by the
year 2000. With man's habitat under
increasing pressure, the United Nations
has convened a 100-nation conference on
problems of human settlement, "Habitat
"76", for June 1976, in Vancouver, Canada.
Global growth
of educational TV
From a world standpoint, "Westerns" and
"soap operas" are not the staple TV diet,
reports "World Communications' Unesco's
recently published 200-country survey of
press, radio, TV and films (the last edition
was published 10 years ago). Cuba devotes
only 20% of TV viewing time to entertain¬
ment, and in several African countries TV
has been introduced primarily to promote
education, as in the Ivory Coast, where a
nation-wide educational TV system is being
built. India plans to use a communication
satellite to bring education programmes to
5,000 villages. In China, the Peking TV
University broadcasts courses at secondary
and university levels. See Bookshelf.
Indian students win
Unesco architecture prize
The 1975 Unesco Prize for Architecture
has been awarded jointly to two Indian
students, Vidhyadhar Chavda and Alka
Shah, a husband and wife team, for their
project one of over 150 entries from
91 schools of architecture in 36 countries
on the theme "Emergency Habitat". Their
design, a simple but effective system of
housing for disaster victims and the home¬
less generally, consists of folding aluminium
frames with plastic coverings, assembled
to form a block of 10 living units. Easy to
pack, transport and erect it could find wide
uses in many countries.
500 years
of Hebrew printing
A major exhibition of 500 years of Hebrew
printing was a principal feature of the 1975
Jerusalem International Book Fair, held from
April 28 to May 5, 1975. The first printed
books in Hebrew which contained the
name of the printer and the place and date
of publication were issued in two Italian
towns, Reggio di Calabria and Pievo di
Saco, both in 1475. Today Israel has
become the world centre of Hebrew printing,
with close to 2,000 titles produced in 1971-
1972, in addition to 500 periodicals, including
daily newspapers, weeklies, monthlies and
quarterlies.
Flashes...
Student enrollment in universities and
other higher education centres of Latin
America has increased by nearly 500%
(from 550,000 to about 2.5 million) during
the past 75 years.
The U.K. plans to contribute about
$18 million towards the cost of a nitrogen¬
ous fertilizer plant in Bangladesh (35% as
a grant and 65% as a 25-year interest free
loan).
A set of ten coloured postcards, each
showing a site or monument Unesco is
helping to save, is now available from the
Public Liaison Division, Unesco, 7, place
de Fontenoy, 75700 Paris (price 6.50 F).
Grain lost each year in India due to
rodents, pests and poor storage (10 million
tons) is twice the amount imported by
India in 1974 and would have more than
met last year's food deficit of 7.5 million
tons, reports "Action", the U.N. Develop¬
ment Programme publication.

Letters to the Editor
AUSTRALIA, A PIONEER OF
WOMEN'S RIGHTS
Sir,
The chronological table in your March,
1975 issue on International Women's
Year has caused some consternation
in this area. We have had complaints
to the effect that the table omits the
fact that under the Australian Govern¬
ment's Electoral Act of 1902, women
over 21 years were granted the right
to vote and the right to sit in Parliament.
Indeed some of the States making up
the Commonwealth had earlier granted
this right to women e.g. South Aus¬
tralia in 1894, Western Australia in 1899.
Australians are rather proud of their
early recognition of women's political
rights.

FUTURE GLOBETROTTER
Sir,
The February 1975 edition of the
"Unesco Courier" was very delightful
to read. I thought the article "Architec¬
ture without Architects" in Tunisia was
done very well.
The article was very inspiring and
when I get older I hope to go to Africa
and Asia and see Tunisia. I go to
Orchard Road School in Belle Mead,
New Jersey, and we sponsor other kids
from different parts of the world to
stay in our country and go to our
schools. We call this A.F.S. (America
Field Service).
We have one boy from Tunisia. His
name is Hatem ben Salem. He showed
us some slides and told us about his
land. I was greatly interested and I
was even more happy when I saw your
article.

UNFORESEEN DANGERS
OF MINERAL EXTRACTION
Sir,
I greatly enjoyed reading Konstantin I.
Lukashev's article "Our Hidden Mineral
Resources" in your February 1975 issue.
The facts and figures he gave concer¬
ning the minerals in all kinds of rocks
and the colossal amount of gold in sea
water were of particular interest.
However, the author does not answer
the crucial question of whether scientists
will be able to measure the effects of
increased mineral extraction on animal
and plant life.
Let's hope that man acts less rashly
in this field than he has in exploiting
the resources of tropical forests. Some
believe that the unbridled felling of such
forests, which Is still going on today, is
jeopardizing the world's oxygen sup¬
plies, while others are convinced that
It is bound to cause climatic changes.
For me the very fact that scientists
cannot accurately foresee the eventual
consequences of this exploitation Is
sufficient reason for halting it.
Man would be well advised to exploit
new mineral resources with circum¬
spection so as to avoid falling into a
trap of his own making.
Jan Kleinlangevelsloo
Heino, Netherlands
Ed. note: while in a few special cases
extraction of minerals might have
local effects on one or two species of
plants and animals, the greatest damage
is caused by the mineral dérivâtes that
man puts back into the natural cycle in
the form of industrial waste. Wastes
from industrial processes using mercury,
for example, are often released into
rivers or the sea causing unnaturally
high local concentrations which can
have disastrous effects on plant and
animal (including human) life. The ac¬
tual process of extraction can (as in
the case of strip-mining), completely
change the ecology of the region in
which it takes place to the detriment
of both the local plant and animal com¬
munities.
INTERNATIONAL TRAFFIC
IN WOMEN
Sir,
On the occasion of International
Women's Year we would like people
to be reminded of the fact that so far
only 49 countries have signed the U.N.
Convention for the Suppression of the
Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation
of the Prostitution of Others, approved
by the U.N. General Assembly on 2
December 1949.
Between January 1974 and June 1975
our organization ("Teams for Action
against the Traffic in Women and Chil¬
dren") brought 175 cases against pro¬
curers, acting Individually or in orga¬
nized networks, before the French
courts. Laws based on internationally
accepted principles are absolutely ne¬
cessary in order to take action against
procurers who carry on their traffic
regardless of frontiers.

SEVENTH CENTENARY
OF AMIR KHUSRAU
Sir,
This year, celebrations of the 7th
centenary of the great poet, mystic
and musician, Amir Khusrau, are being
organized throughout India.
The tolerant and catholic attitude of
Amir Khusrau... are qualities which are
much needed today and give him a
direct relevance to our times.
The celebrations, which culminate in
October 1975, are aimed at reviving
wide Interest In this popular poet.

WORLD RAINFALL RECORD
Sir,
In your very fine issue on weather
(August-September 1973) you included
a map of world weather records adap
ted from one prepared by our agency.
We were very pleased by the adap¬
tation and honoured by its appearance
in your journal; but we have noticed
an inaccurate place designation which
we would like to bring to your attention.
The world's greatest 42-minute rainfall
occurred in Holt, Missouri not Holt,
Montana.
We are enclosing a copy of our
recently updated map, which contains
a record from Montana as well as the
one from Holt, Missouri. As you can
see, the two states are some distance
apart, and we have used different ab¬
breviations of the state names.

PHILAE REBORN
Sir,
Congratulations on Henri Stierlin's
article "Philae, a masterpiece of archi¬
tecture reborn", (November 1974 issue).
Ever since you published the first of
your articles on these Pharaonic tem¬
ples, I have read everything I could
find about these masterpieces of world
art.
I was profoundly moved to read of
the resurgence of Philae in Henri Stier¬
lin's article, and even more impressed
to learn how various countries have
responded to the appeal launched by
Mr. René Maheu, when he was Unesco's
Director-General, by contributing finan¬
cially to the campaign to save these
temples.

THE HERITAGE OF NEPAL
Sir,
I found your whole issue on the con¬
servation of the cultural heritage of
Nepal (December 1974) extremely fas¬
cinating and encouraging in terms of
the importance of that heritage to the
whole human race. As a restoration
architect, I found the articles very well
presented, particularly In their coverage
of the complex issues involved.

WINDOW ON THE WORLD
OF ART
Sir,
Your round-up of Unesco's 1975-76
programme (February 1975 issue) men¬
tions that a project will study how art
teachers and students can help to pro¬
mote a better public understanding of
art. Next year will be my third year of
teaching art in this tiny (population 175)
Montana community. Often I wish I had
more opportunity to bring Unesco Ideas
into this remote community which is
culturally isolated from the world beyond
Montana for most of its citizens, parti¬
cularly the younger ones. Your wonder¬
ful Window on the World will inspire
me.

Just published
Published on the occasion of International Women's Year,
Women, Education, Equality: a decade of experiment, reviews
and analyses three experimental projects in Unesco's
long-term programme to promote equal educational
opportunities for women.
Carried out in countries with very different cultural traditions
and at various stages of development, the Unesco projects
centered on education for rural women (in Upper Volta),
training for women primary school teachers (in Nepal) and the
access of women to technical careers (in Chile).
Written for the layman as well as the educator, the study offers
guidelines to other countries for integrating women into
development through the channel of education.
