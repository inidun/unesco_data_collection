Stairway of the prophets
Among the sculptors of 18th century Brazil, one name stands out above all others: Antonio
Francisco Lisboa, known affectionately as "O Aleijadinho" (The Little Cripple) because his hands
were made almost useless by a deforming disease. Yet O Aleijadinho, the son of a Negro mother
and a father of Portuguese origin, painfully continued to carve the distinctive baroque sculpture
that still decorates many churches in the province of Minas Gerais in south-central Brazil. Shown
here are four of his 12 more-than-life-sized figures of the prophets on the stairway of the Mato-
sinhos Church at Congonhas do Campo, executed when he was over 60. O Aleijadinho (1730-1814)
is said to have worked with hammer and chisel attached to his crippled hands, and many legends
grew up around him. But his true story is that of an indomitable will that triumphed over adversity
to give Brazil masterpieces of baroque art imbued with a rare power and vitality.

This month's cover is meant to
symbolize the varied faces of
Latin America today and the
richness of its culture derived
from the mixture of different
races and peoples. The cover
is a poster produced by a Peruvian
artist, Ruiz Durand, for a land
reform campaign launched by the
Peruvian Governmerft, and evokes
the image of the great Peruvian
chief, Tupac Amaru, descendant
of the Incas, who in 1780 led
a revolt against the Spanish rule.
This issue of the Unesco Courier
is devoted in its entirety to the
culture of Latin America,
with special emphasis on the
literature and art of the continent.

In the past quarter of a century, profound changes have been
occurring in Latin America which have led certain critics to
remark that Latin America is witnessing a veritable "Cultural
Explosion". Since 1967, Unesco has been carrying out a wide-
ranging study of Latin American cultures, covering literature,
philosophy, architecture, town-planning, the plastic arts, music,
theatre, the cinema, etc. For this ambitious enterprise, Unesco
has secured the collaboration of a large number of Latin
American scholars and specialists. Many of these studies will
be presented in separate volumes under the general title "Latin
America Within its Culture". The first volume, dealing with
literature, is scheduled to appear later this year or early in 1973.
It will first be published in Spanish, probably in collaboration
with a commercial publisher. It is planned that editions in
other languages will follow in due course. Most of the articles
published in this issue will appear in more extensive and
elaborate form in the Unesco series of cultural books on Latin
America. (Other aspects of civilization, science and education
in Latin America were presented in our special issue, "Latin
America, 150 years of Independence", in June 1961).
Latin American coun¬
tries no longer want
to live on the smoke¬
screen prestige of
past history. World
events affect us
directly and dramati¬
cally, and demand an
answer: either the
oppression of the past
or the transformation
of the original forms
of society for a com¬
mon life of dignity
where the sharing of
material wealth is not
opposed to individual
freedom.

LATIN AMERICA'S
CULTURAL EXPLOSION
by
CesarFernandez-Moreno

CESAR FERNANDEZ-MORENO, of Argentina,
is head of the Unesco programme of cultural
studies on Latin America described above.
Essayist, critic and poet, he has founded and
directed various literary magazines, and has
written for radio, television and the cinema
in Latin America. His books on culture
include "Introducción à la Poesía" (1962),
"La Realidad y los Papeles" (Books and Real¬
ity, 1967) and "Argentina" (to appear shortly).
"A
AMERICA is the land of the
future. In years to come one will
point to its historical importance,
perhaps in a direct challenge between
North and South America. . . America
is a land of dreams for all who are
weary of Old Europe, now a museum
of the past. . . Everything that has
taken place in America up until now
has been a mere echo of the Old
World, a reflection of foreign ways.
But as the land of the future, America
is not our concern, since the philo¬
sopher makes no prophecies."
A century and a half have passed
since Hegel made this prediction for
America, while protesting that he was
no prophet. The future of which he
wrote has now become America's
present; the continent of his time has
already passed into history. North
America is now the home of the
world's most powerful nation, and
South America or rather, present-day
Latin America represents one of the
most dynamic cultural concepts in the
modern world.
Latin America commands world
attention for a number of reasons, the
first being its population explosion.
Latin America's growth rate is the
highest of any continent: 2.9 per cent
annually. Its population now numbers
more than 270 million, unevenly dis¬
tributed over 21 million square kilo¬
metres of land.
Occurring in a so-called underdevel¬
oped economy, this population explo¬
sion threatens to spark off a political
explosion, and this chain reaction or
sequence of explosions can be expect¬
ed, in turn, to bring about a cultural
explosion in Latin America.
Yet why is it that countries which
are far from being wholly Latin in
either language or customs have
become known collectively as "Latin
America"? What is Latin America?
And first of all, why "Latin"?
Three of the nations which discover¬
ed, conquered and colonized the new
continent Spain, Portugal and France
spoke Latin languages. So the
broad historical definition "Latin Am¬
erica" has been applied to all the lands
in the new continent which were

peopled by these three European
powers, in contradistinction to the
"Anglo-Saxon" countries of North
America.
But the Mexican writer, José Luis
Martinez, in his recent study on unity
and diversity in Latin America, points
out that Its present make-up "is some¬
what more complicated than the simple
pattern which prevailed up to the mid-
20th century.
"It still comprises the original group
of 21 countries: Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
Puerto Rico, El Salvador, Uruguay and
Venezuela. But Puerto Rico is a self-
governing commonwealth associated
with the United States, and Puerto
Ricans have U.S. citizenship. And
four new countries have been created
since 1960: Jamaica, Barbados, Trini¬
dad and Tobago, and Guiana, mainly
English-speaking, which belong to the
British Commonwealth of Nations."
The Conquest of the 16th century
practically annihilated the great Middle
American and Andean cultures, though
at the same time it infused them with
new life by transfprming them Into the
first vehicles for a process of western¬
ization.
This process also affected the other
peoples of America, who were at that
time in less advanced stages of devel¬
opment the peoples to whom the
name "Indians" was given by European
navigators and explorers, misled by
the monumental geographical error
which led them to believe that they
had reached East Asia.
Within what is now called Latin
America, another world with non-
Latin roots was to emerge: the African
community.
During the 16th and 17th centuries,
slave trading the exploitation of peo¬
ple of one colour by those of another
was carried on in the Caribbean
area and elsewhere. One hundred mil¬
lion Negroes were shipped from Africa
though only a third were to arrive at
their destination in the New World.
Yet this infamous commerce had
some surprising results: the slaves
rewarded their masters by handing on
what they had been able to retain of
their African culture, by teaching them
many things, from singing and dancing
to fighting for freedom.
This African America had a powerful
influence, not only in the Caribbean
area itself, but in the frontier zones
of the north of South America and
the south of North America. These
boundary areas are thus both a barrier
and a channel of communication, and
in any event, a source of enrichment.
The complex network of relation¬
ships in Latin America thus offers prac¬
tically limitless scope for interaction
and reaction, and tempts one to draw
parallels with other similar or compar¬
able situations.
Yet, the more one tries to ordern
the true nature of this huge region,
the more indistinct its image becomes.
The sociologist, Gino Germani, points
to two contradictory viewpoints,
"diametrically opposed, but concurring
to accord a real identity to Latin
America."
The first "emphasizes the Latin or
Graeco-Roman, Christian, Spanish or
Iberian character of the American sub¬
continent." In the second, "Latin
America is seen as a unit, not merely
in cultural and social terms, but also

CENTURY
OF THE PEOPLE?
A thumbnail sketch of our
historyacross the centuries
would give this outline:
the 16th century was the
century of the conquis¬
tadors, when the Spanish
people, under their great
captains, brought a whole
continent of hope under
the spread of a single flag;
the 17th century was that
of our forefathers and the
birth of a new people to
rejoice in this land; the
18th century was that of
the forerunners andheralds
of liberty; the 19th century
was the century of the
"Liberators" who separat¬
ed America from Spain and
demonstrated the might of
the masses who served
under their flags. . .Will the
20th century be the cen¬
tury of the people ?

and especially in political terms. . .
The unifying factor is an external one,
antagonistic and menacing."
In the first of these approaches the
key to the enigma seems to be cultural,
and In the. second, political. But both,
we should note, are qualified by still
another factor geography: in the first
case, the reference to the "American
sub-continent", and in the second, to
an "external" factor.
Such special reasoning is almost
inevitable in any attempt to clarify the
image of Latin America. A merely
ethnic criterion, contrasting Latin with
Anglo-Saxon stocks, would meet the
case no better; not only because of
the Indians, Africans and various later
immigrants, but also because of the
ethnic intermingling which can be
found on many of the West Indian
islands, where a mixture of Indian,
Spanish and African blood is given
the all-embracing label of "Latin". A
striking example Is Haiti, a French-
speaking country with a mainly Negro
population.
A more recent development to be
taken into account is the now evident
racial and social penetration of the
southern part of the United States by
Latin peoples. Latin America is infil¬
trating North America from below, by
a sort of demographic capillary attrac¬
tion running up through Puerto Rico,
Mexico and Cuba. The invasion might
be said, in one sense, to compensate
the Latin American people for the
territories they lost when their nations
were in course of formation.
Nor would a purely linguistic
approach be acceptable, taking Latin
America to consist of those countries
which speak Spanish or Portuguese.
Of the 254 million people who made
up the population of Latin America
in 1968, over 164 million (64.5 per
cent) spoke Spanish; and over 85 mil¬
lion were Portuguese-speaking Brazi¬
lians (33.4 per cent). The remaining
2.1 per cent spoke French or English
or (in Curaçao and Surinam) Dutch.
Yet this mixture of Western langua¬
ges is not the only obstacle to a simple
definition of Latin America in linguistic
terms. Pre-Columbian tongues survive
and are widely used in some countries
(as in bilingual Paraguay where Span¬
ish and the Guarani Indian language
are spoken). For similar reasons, a
comparison that contrasts the Catholi¬
cism of Latin America with the Protes
tantism of North America is Irrele¬
vant, since about one-quarter of the
population of the United States are
Catholics.
In spite of this confused tangle of
concepts, the modern world is begin¬
ning to see in a new light and to attri¬
bute a real meaning to the complex
ensemble which persists in calling
itself "Latin America".
If we delve deeper to find the roots
of this apparent unity, history provides
the first clue: it lies in the dependence
of the whole sub-continent to a suc¬
cession of foreign powers. Latin Amer¬
ica was first subject to Iberian domi¬
nation; after this crumbled, the British
and then the North Americans built up
new empires in Latin America, not this
time in the political but in the economic
sphere.
If this stigma of dependence is the
first point to be considered in defining
the elusive concept of Latin America,
the second Is its involvement in the
Great Divide of current history the
widening gulf between rich and poor
countries. This contrast is strikingly
illustrated by the two Americas, where
the North is the rich man and the
South the poor relation.

LAT. AM. CULTURAL EXPLOSION (Continued)
Melting-pot of races and peoples
8
These two criteria are complement¬
ed and confirmed by a third more ele¬
mentary factor: geography. Latin
America comprises all of the continent
which lies south of the Rio Grande,
or Rio Bravo (marking the frontier bet¬
ween the United States and Mexico).
This explains the familiar exoression
"South of the Rio Grande": south of
the river there is a certain cultural,
political, racial, linguistic and religious
uniformity.
Three motives for the colonization
of America have often been attributed
to the Spaniards: the warlike drive
acquired in reconquering part of
Spain's territory from the Arabs;
Catholic missionary zeal; and lastly,
cupidity (for gold, slaves and women).
Each historian and writer is apt to
stress the motive which appeals to him
most strongly; but in practice it was
no doubt a combination of the three
given above that led to the integration
of the Old World with its other half.
Christopher Colombus was to some
extent a mystic, but this did not pre¬
vent him from adopting an elaborate
strategy to dazzle the Reyes Católicos,
Ferdinand and Isabella, with the gold
of the continent he wished to "sell"
them.
"Gold is the greatest good", he
wrote, "gold becomes treasure, and
whoever possesses it can obtain all
he desires in this world; it can even
lead souls to Heaven." From gold to
Heaven; here was Colombus' career
in a nutshell.
What also Influenced the Spaniards
was the astonishment that filled the
hearts and minds of the explorers and
conquistadors. The awe felt by Colum¬
bus, face to face with America, often
bordered on delirium: when he ap¬
proached the mouth of the Orinoco,
he thought he had discovered one of
the rivers flowing from Paradise.
I H E same amazement
gripped every Spaniard who came
after him. Indians who smoke, for
example, are described by the con¬
quistadors as "men and women who
walk about fumigating themselves
with a burning firebrand." An atmo¬
sphere of knightly adventure illuminat¬
ed the conquest of Mexico. The
great Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, wrote
the conquistador and chronicler, Diaz
del Castillo, "recalls the enchantments
related in the book of Amadis de
Gaula."
Cortes himself discovered farther
north the coastline which he named
California from an early 16th century
tale of adventure and daring. None of
the Europeans could believe what he
saw with his own eyes: none felt that
he was the master of his fate.
The Indians, on their side, were
puzzled by the sight of a man on
horseback, which they assumed to be
some sort of centaur; and they were
dumbfounded when a rider dismounted
from his steed: one creature dividing
into twol The Incas supposed that
horses ate metal because of the bit
held In the animal's mouth; when the
Spaniards asked for fodder for their
mounts, they were offered goldl
Out of this mutual astonishment was
to grow the whole Latin American
culture, with all its creative art. Art
is very often nothing more than an
expression of amazement, which gener¬
ates in the artist an impulse to share
his extraordinary vision with others.
In America, this impulse turned the
conquistadors themselves, and humble,
semi-illiterate soldiers, into unsuspect¬
ed authors: in simple but wonderfully
vivid words they recounted the surpris¬
ing things they had seen or imagined
they saw.
The great pre-Columbian civilizations
were rich in architecture, sculpture and
music (music that has been handed
down almost intact to the present day).
The chief European contributions were
language, religion and various forms
of technology unknown to America.
But in the course of history, Latin
America's store of culture tended to
be polarized in a sort of sterile alter¬
native, harking back to the conqueror-
conquered situation: European on the
one hand, American on the other.
The American element preserved the
cultural remains of the great civiliza¬
tions which flourished before the dis¬
covery and conquest of the sub-conti¬
nent, such as those which still survive
in the present republics of Mexico
and Peru.
The European element was the
culture brought by the pioneers and
conquistadors, among other products
of the Western civilization they repre¬
sented; it was thus a specifically Euro¬
pean phenomenon, although implanted
by the colonizers in the new lands
incorporated in their dominions.
This division created an antithesis
which long distorted the relationship
between the Latin American and Euro¬
pean cultures, by assuming the only
authentic, original contribution of Latin
America to be those vestiges of its
civilizations which had survived the
impact of conquest and colonization.
Viewed in this light, European culture
was thus rejected as being colonialist
and purely imitative in nature.
Indeed, being vanquished by military
might, the original inhabitants of Amer¬
ica the real Americans were des¬
poiled of their empires and posses¬
sions, to receive in exchange the bene¬
fits, highly questionable from their
point of view, of expanding Western
culture.
But although they were driven
towards the borders of their empires
and reduced to a marginal proletariat,
the process was halted before all
traces of them were wiped out. They
survived and still exist, a genuine If
not an influential component of the
new Western world now evolving.
Incorporated In this new world are
many of the characteristics of their
distinct civilizations, now reckoned
among the outstanding traits of the
originality of Latin America.
f% mixed culture inevitably
emerged from the opening-up of the
country, not only because of the wide¬
spread racial fusion that resulted from
the absence of women in the Spanish
expeditions, but owing to the intercom¬
munication essential for mutual under¬
standing. The Spaniards had to explain
Europe to the Americans, and the
latter interpreted America to the Euro¬
peans. First the Indians and later the
mestizos, of mixed Indian and Spanish
ancestry, developed a new conscious¬
ness of themselves as Americans.
The solution to the unrealistic
alternative between the American and
the European was to become both, that
is, to become an Americanized Euro¬
pean or a Europeanized American. A
synthesized conception of its own
nature thus prevailed in the higher
Latin American culture.
This recognizes not only the contri¬
butions of the original cultures, but
also those of the European pioneers,
the fundamental African element which
reached America through the slave
trade, and lastly, the rejuvenating cur¬
rents of learning brought by the immi¬
grations of the 19th century.
"The New World", wrote the famous
French anthropologist, the late Paul
Rivet, "has been a focus for the con¬
vergence of races and peoples since
prehistoric times. . . It Is curious
indeed that the history of America's
evolution should merely repeat the
ethnic trends which presided over its
first peopling. Since its discovery,
America has continued to be a focus
of attraction for the most varied peo¬
ples and races, just as it was during
the long pre-Columbian population
process."
Thus, the possible Asian and Ocea¬
nic ancestry of all the American peo¬
ples, and America's possible geogra¬
phical continuity with Africa in the
remote past, are hypotheses which
would provide a world background for
America's claim to universality. Amer¬
ica is, as it were, a preview of the
world of the future, where, overriding
differences of race and culture, man¬
kind will find real unity.

As the people of Ibero-America become conscious of their identity,
they are scrutinizing themselves, their place in history and their rôle

its ridiculous passion to be different from what it really is. The
differences that exist between Ibero-America and the West no longer
instil in us feelings of inferiority, but instead the deep sentiment of
our own individuality and our own personality. . Ibero-America's
history reveals a double experience the history ofdominatingpeoples
and of dominated people a double experience often unknown to
other peoples who have lived only the rôle of oppressor or the op¬
pressed. This experience, if it is to bear fruit, must lead the peoples
of Ibero-America to the healthy assimilation of the values of the

I HE Brazilian writer Mario
Vieira de Mello, one of the few Latin
Americans to have dealt with the
problem of the relationship between
underdevelopment and culture, estab¬
lishes a distinction that is valid for
all Latin America.
According to him, a marked change
of perspective has occurred. More
or less up to the 1930s the notion of
a "new land" prevailed among us,
the notion of a land which had still
not realized its potential but which
believed itself to have great possibi¬
lities for future progress.
Nowadays, although there is no
essential change in the distance which
separated and still separates us from
rich countries, the notion of an "under¬
developed country" prevails. The first
notion stressed effort and, con¬
sequently, unrealized potential. The
second stresses the poverty and
ANTONIO CANDIDO, Brazilian literary critic
and writer, has specialized In Latin American
literature and panicularly Brazilian literature.
He is professor of literature at the University
of Säo Paulo, Brazil. Among his many books
are 'Flcçâo e Confessäo" (Fiction and Confes¬
sion, 1956), "Tese e Antitese' (Thesis and
Antithesis, 1964), 'Formacäo da Literatura
Braslleira' (Evolution of Brazilian Literature,
1959) and "Introduçâo à Literatura do Brazil"
(Introduction to Brazilian Literature).
atrophy of the present what is lacking
rather than what we possess in
abundance. .
I am not in agreement with the
conclusions which Mario Vieira de
Mello draws from that distinction; but
considered on its own merit, the dis¬
tinction is exact and helps in the
understanding of certain fundamental
aspects of literary creation in Latin
America.
It Is certain that the idea of a "new
land" gives rise to certain funda¬
mental attitudes in literature, attitudes
derived from the admiration and
interest aroused by the exotic, from
a certain respect for grandeur and
from hope in its possibilities.
Latin American intellectuals have
inherited this enthusiasm and have
transformed it into an instrument of
national affirmation and ideological
justification. Stimulated by Roman¬
ticism, backed up by hyperbole and
with exoticism transformed into a
state of mind, literature became the
language of celebration and of ten¬
derness. Our sky was bluer, our
flowers prettier, our landscapes more
inspiring than those of other places.
The idea of nationhood was closely
linked to that of nature and to some
extent derived its reason for existence
from this. Both gave rise to a
literature which compensated for
material backwardness and the weak
ness of institutions by overvaluing ti e
"regional" aspects and making exoti¬
cism the justification for social
optimism.
But on the opposite side of the
coin, the discouraging aspects depend¬
ed on the same order of associations,
as if weakness or the lack of instit¬
utional organization constituted an
inconceivable paradox in the face of
the grandeur of nature. (In America,
everything is big, only man is small).
However, given the cause and effect
relationship "beautiful land... great na¬
tion", it is not difficult to see the
effects that the change of perspective
that went with awareness of underde¬
velopment would have in bringing to
the fore the reality of unproductive
soil, technical backwardness, the over¬
whelming poverty of the people, their
paralyzing lack of culture. This view
was pessimistic with regard to the
present and problematic in relation to
the future.
Awareness of underdevelopment
dates from after the Second World
War, particularly from the 1950s on¬
wards. But already in the 1930s, the
change of direction had taken place
especially in regional fiction which
may be considered as a barometer.
This kind of narrative abandoned

In the picturesque enchantment or In
the decorative, gentlemanly way that
rural, man, was portrayed. It is not
inaccurate to. say 'that, from this point
of;: view, the novel came to be a
demystifying, force which anticipated
the, economist's and- the politician's
awareness, of: the problem.
If we consider the material condi¬
tions for, the existence of literature,
the basic factor is probably illiteracy
which, in those countries where there
had' been advanced, pre-Columbian
civilizations, is aggravated by the use
of, more than one language.
Illiteracy is, in fact, linked to other
manifestations of cultural weakness:
the lack of means of communication
and' distribution (publishing houses,
libraries, magazines, newspapers); the
scarcity, or the wide dispersion and
the small size of the public for
literature because of the reduced
number of real readers (a much
smaller number than the comparatively
low percentage of literates); the
impossibility for writers to specialize in
their literary work which was usually
pursued as a marginal activity or
simply out of sheer passion for the
craft; the lack of resistance or discri¬
mination in the face of foreign
influences and pressures. Economic
and political factors enter into this
weakness.
Illiteracy is not, in some cases,
enough to explain weakness in other
sectors, although it is the basic
characteristic of underdevelopment in
the cultural field.
In other sectors, a fact such as the
development of publishing in the 1940s
in Mexico and in Argentina showed
that the lack of books, was not simply
a result of the reduced number of
readers and their low buying power,
since the whole of America, including
the Portuguese-speaking regions,
exhausted some quite big editions,
especially those of high quality.
Perhaps it is possible to conclude
that bad publishing habits and the lack
of communication increased to the limit
the inertia of the public; and that there
had existed an unsatisfied potential
for the marketing of books.
This last example reminds us that in
Latin America the problem of public
presents original characteristics, since
it constitutes the only group of under¬
developed countries which speak Eur¬
opean languages (if we except the in¬
digenous groups), and which have
also sprung culturally from metropoli¬
tan countries that are still underdev¬
eloped today. In these old metropolitan
countries, the consumption of litera¬
ture is still restricted if we compare
them to the developed countries.
It Is possible to imagine that the
Latin American writer might be doomed
to remain forever what he has al
ways been a producer for a minority,
although this does not mean that he
produces for groups of high aesthetic
level but simply for a restricted num¬
ber with a liking for reading.
In effect, it must not be forgotten that
modern audiovisual resources may
produce such a change in the creat¬
ive process and the means of commu¬
nication that when the mass of the
people finally attain elementary in¬
struction, they will seek satisfaction
for the universal need for fiction and
poetry outside the printed book.
To put it in another way, in most of
our countries, there are considerable
masses of people who have still not
reached the higher level of literature
and are still submerged in the folk¬
lore stage of oral communication
when, having become literate, they are
caught up in the process of urbaniza¬
tion and fall under the influence of
radio, television, comic strips and
popular magazines which form the
basis of mass culture.
Hence the number of readers of
literature, as we understand it here,
does not increase proportionately with
the growth of literacy, for literates
and illiterates alike progress directly
from the stage of folklore to that type
of urban folklore which is mass culture. 1 1
Besides, this problem is one of the "
most serious in the underdeveloped
countries because of the broad pene-

tration of what might be called cultu¬
ral "know-how" and the prefabricated
materials of mass culture which come
from the developed countries. This
know-how and mass culture not only
spreads the values of the industrially
developed countries but also enables
them to direct, in their own interests,
the sensibility and opinion of the popu¬
lations of the underdeveloped coun¬
tries.
Illiteracy and cultural weakness not
only Influence the external aspects.
Their influence on the very conscience
of the writer and on the nature of his
creation is even more significant.
In one period, the writer shared the
Ideology of enlightenment, accord¬
ing to which education would auto¬
matically bring about conditions fav¬
ourable to the full development of
man and his progress In society.
At the outset, education was reserv¬
ed for a minority of citizens who en¬
joyed economic and political advan¬
tages; later, it was envisaged as a dis¬
tant, vague possibility for the people
who were viewed less as a reality than
as a liberal concept. The Emperor
Pedro II of Brazil declared that he
would rather have been a teacher, an
attitude similar to that of the Argen¬
tinean, Sarmiento, who believed that
the triumph of civilization over barba¬
rism would have as its premise poten¬
tial urbanization based on education.
A curious case is that of the Bra¬
zilian thinker, Manuel Bonfim, who in
1905 published a fascinating book,
Latin America. Bonfim analyzes our
backwardness as a function of the per¬
sistence of a colonial status, as reveal¬
ed In the continued existence of oli¬
garchies and foreign imperialism.
Finally, when he seems to be leading
up to a theory of the transformation of
social structures as a necessary pre-'
condition, a disappointing strangula¬
tion of his argument takes place and
Bonfim ends by prescribing education
as the panacea. We here sense that
we are at the nub of the "enlighten¬
ment Illusion".
In consequence, the intellectuals
created a vision that was just as dis¬
torted when confronted with the pre¬
vailing lack of culture. Whilst lament¬
ing the ignorance of the people and
wishing that this might disappear, so
that their countries might automati¬
cally rise up to the high level destin¬
ed for them, they excluded themselves
from the context and considered them¬
selves an isolated, truly "fluctuating"
group. And, in effect, they floated, with
or without consciousness of guilt,
above the lack of culture and the back¬
wardness, certain that these could not
contaminate or affect the quality of
what they were doing.
In point of fact, the general lack
of culture produced and still produces
an even more far-reaching weakness
which affects intellectual life and the
very quality of literary works.
Cultural poverty necessarily sub¬
jected the writer to metropolitan
models and to European models in
general, establishing an elite grouping
which was to some extent aristocratic
in relation to the uncultured public.
In effect, insofar as a sufficient local
public did not exist, the writer wrote as
if his ideal public existed in Europe
and so, very often, disassociated him¬
self from his own land. Th's gave
rise to works which authors and
readers considered highly refined,
because they assimilated the form
and values of Europe.
Another aspect of this alienating
"aristocratic" attitude worth recalling
Is the use of foreign languages in
creative writing, which then appeared a
laudable refinement. Some extreme
examples underline the paradoxical
and comic side of this literary vogue.
One instance is that of the fifth-rate
Brazilian Romantic, Pires de Almeida
who, at the beginning of the century,
published in French a theatrical
work probably written much earlier:
La Fête des Crânes: drame de muurs
indiennes en trois actes et douze
tableaux. (The Ceremony of Skulls:
a drama of Indian customs in 3 acts
and 12 tableaux.)
All this did not take place without
some ambivalence since, on the one
hand, the elite Imitated the good and
bad of Europe, and at one and the
same time affirmed the most intransi¬
gent spiritual independence, in a pen¬
dulum movement between reality and
their ideological Utopia. Thus we see
that illiteracy and refinement, cosmo¬
politanism and regionalism may have
their roots in the soil of cultural
deprivation as well as In the effort
to overcome this.
An interesting problem from the
point of view of the dependence which
arises from cultural backwardness is
that of various types of influence, good
or bad, inevitable and unnecessary.
Our literatures (like those of North
America) are basically branches of
metropolitan literatures. And if we set
aside susceptibilities of national pride,
we shall see that despite the indepen¬
dence from these which they achieved
little by little, they are still largely
their reflections.
In the case of the numerically
superior Spanish and Portuguese
countries, the independence process
consisted, to a great extent, in the
transfer of dependence so that from
the nineteenth century onwards, other
non-metropolitan literatures, especially
French, became the models, something
which also occurred in the old
metropolitan countries. At the present
time, it is essential to take North
American literature into account as a
new focus of attraction.
This Is what might be called inevit¬
able influence and is sociologically
linked to our dependence from the
moment of the Conquest and the
sometimes brutal transplantation of
cultures.
Many consider Spanish American
"Modernism" as a species of rite of

THE URBAN EXPLOSION
In the 19th and beginning of the 20th
century, Latin American novels were mark¬
ed by a special emphasis on regionalism
and rural settings. Recent years have
witnessed a new flowering of Latin Amer¬
ican Literature enriched by psychological
studies of the complexities and problems
of city life. (Photo shows a typical street
in downtown Buenos Aires.) This devel¬
opment reflects the mushroom growth of
cities throughout the Latin American conti¬
nent. The novels and short stories now
emerging in Spanish and Portuguese-
speaking America have been hailed as
amongst the most vigorous and original
in the growing world literature of today.
GRANDEUR
OF NATURE
The almost lunar quality
of this landscape in Chi¬
lean Patagonia is in violent
contrast with the impene¬
trable virgin forests, the
vast plains and "sertöes",
the impregnable cordilleras
and the imposing rivers
found elsewhere in Latin
America. The grandeur of
nature is one of the
major themes of Latin
American literature and art.

CREATION
MYTH AND REALITY
"Magical reality", says the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, "is the heritage of all America...
America is nowhere near exhausting the founts of its mythology." Its presence is in
evidence in many of the literary and artistic creations the continent has produced. In
this oil painting by the Cuban artist Wilfredo Lam, entitled "The Abalochas dance for
Chango", various elements of Afro-Cuban mythology the spirit of fertility, the spirit
of resurrection, the god of war evoke the vision of a tropical forest
We, who are writers from the vast expanses of America, are constantly
on the alert to fill these open spaces with living persons of real flesh
and blood. Not only are we conscious of this creative need, we also
see our duty to raise a critical voice in this empty world, which despite
its emptiness is no less filled with injustices, deprivations and suffering.
Furthermore, we feel equally bound to rekindle the ancient dreams
that have long slumbered in our statues of stone, in the ruins of our
ancient monuments, in the infinite silence of our planetary pampas,
our thick forests, our rivers echoing the din of thunder. For we must
people with words the confines of a silent continent with the thrill
that comes from the intoxicating task of creating myths and putting

Our art has always been baroque
from the magnificent pre-Co¬

a baroque born of the need to
put names to things, even if in so
doing we move away from more
fashionable techniques.

Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Mexico and

The life. and problems of the Aimaraes Indians of Lake Titicaca in

films dealing with poignant social and human problems of today.
THE PLIGHT OF THE INDIANS
The Indian is no mere figure of history or archaeology;
he is alive and present, part of us. ..it is neither right nor
reasonable or indeed worthy of us to exclude from our
traditions that part which we see every day around us
in our songs and dances, in our books, in the street,
which flows in our veins and in the hearts of all our
fellow men.

LITERATURE AND DEVELOPMENT (Continued trom page 12)
AFRICAN ROOTS
African culture in Brazil is far
from a mere museum or anthropo¬
logical curiosity. It is not merely
picturesque but a living, creative
reality. Brazilian culture is noted
more for its extra-European traits
than for its passively colonial
sub-European characteristics.
And much of what contributes to
this Brazilian culture comes from
the fact that the Negro has had
an opportunity to express himself
as a Brazilian and not as an intru¬
der either ethnically or culturally.
Gilberto Freyre (Brazil)
passage which, because of its capacity
for originality, marks our literary com¬
ing of age. Nevertheless, if we cor¬
rect the perspective and define the
fields, we shall perhaps see that this
is truer as a psychological fact than
as an aesthetic reality.
It is true that Rubén Darío, and later
the whole movement, turned back for
the first time the current of influences,
carrying that of America to Spain; this
was a break in the literary dominion
which the latter had exercised.
But the fact is that such a movement
did not stem from original resources of
expression but from the adaptation of
French attitudes and processes. What
the Spaniards received was the in¬
fluence of France, already filtered and
translated by Latin Americans who, in
this way, took their place as cultural
mediators.
A fundamental stage in the overcom¬
ing of dependence is the ability to
produce first-rate works, influenced
not by foreign models but by previous
national works.
Thus, it is possible to say that the
Argentinean, Jorge Luis Borges, rep¬
resents the first indisputable original
influence exercised in a general and
recognizable manner upon the originat¬
ing countries because of his new way
of understanding the process of
writing.
The case of the avant-garde of the
1920s is Interesting since they repre¬
sent an extraordinary liberation in ex¬
pressive techniques. The Chilean poet,
Vicente Huidobro, founds "creation-
ism" in Paris, Inspired by the French
and the Italians. He writes his poetry
in French and in French explains his
poetic principles in magazines such as
L'Esprit Nouveau.
Argentinean "Ultraism" and Brazilian
"Modernism" stem directly from the
same sources. And all that does not
prevent these movements from making
innovations, nor their originators from
being the creators, par excellence, of
our new literature; besides Huidobro
and Borges, they include the Bra¬
zilians, Mario de Andrade, Oswald
de Andrade and Manuel Bandeira.
We know, then, that we are part of
a greater culture in which we partici¬
pate as a variant. That is, contrary to
what our grandparents ingenuously
supposed, it is an illusion to speak
of suppression of contacts and influen¬
ces. At a time when the world tenden¬
cy is interrelation and interaction, the
Utopias of originality no longer persist
in a national sense though they are
understandable in the phase of newly-
formed nations.
In the present stage of awareness of
underdevelopment, the question is,
therefore, more complex. Is there a
paradox here? In effect, the more he
realizes the tragic reality of under¬
development, the more free and
thinking man believes in the need to
reject the foreign economic yoke and
to modify the internal structures which
contribute to the underdeveloped
situation.
Nevertheless, he sees the problem
of Influences with more objectivity,
considering them as cultural and social
links. So much so that awareness of
this link coincides with the beginning
of an ability to make innovations on
the level of expression and with strug¬
gle on the level of economic and poli¬
tical development.
On the other hand, the traditional
affirmation of originality, in the sense
of elementary particularism, led and
still leads, on the one hand to the pic¬
turesque and on the other to cultural
slavery two sicknesses of growth
which are perhaps inevitable but, In
any case are alienating.
Because of the aesthetic movements
of the 1920s and the intense aesthetic
and social awareness of more recent
years, we began to feel that depen¬
dence was moving towards cultural
interdependence. This will not only give
Latin American writers the awareness
of their unity in diversity but will also
favour the fruition of more mature, ori¬
ginal works which will gradually be
assimilated by other peoples, including
those of . the metropolitan countries.
The road of reflection upon the prob¬
lem of underdevelopment leads, in
the cultural field, to transnational in¬
tegration, as what was imitation is
slowly transformed into reciprocal
assimilation.
One example among many. In the
work of the Peruvian, Mario Vargas
Llosa, especially La ciudad y los per¬
ros (The Time of the Heroes), the tra¬
dition of the stream of consciousness
appeared in an extraordinarily refined
form, and is a technique that belong¬
ed to Proust and Joyce as well as to
Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, to
Döblin and Faulkner.
Here the novelist of an underdev¬
eloped country used ingredients which
came as a cultural borrowing from the
countries which produced the original
literary forms. Nevertheless, he ad¬
justed them in depth to his own pur¬
pose in order to represent the prob¬
lems of his country and invented his
own personal formulae. In this case,
there is neither imitation nor mecha¬
nical reproduction. There is a sharing
of resources which have become com¬
mon property through the situation of
dependence, thus contributing to mak¬
ing this a situation of interdependence.
It appears that one of the positive
characteristics of the underdeveloped
period is the overcoming of the atti¬
tude of suspicion which leads to the
indiscriminate acceptance or to the illu¬
sion of any originality limited exclu¬
sively to local themes.
In Cuba, can one really speak of
artifice or evasion in the case of Alejo
Carpentier, whose work is impregnat¬
ed with surrealism, and whose vision
is a complex trans-national . vision
even with regard to the theme of a
novel like El siglo de las luces (Ex-
plosion in the Cathedral)? 1 k

PATHWAYS
TO
A NEW ART
by Jean Franco
I
JEAN FRANCO has written extensively on
Latin American culture generally, and In
particular the art and literature of Latin
America. Professor of Latin American Lit¬
erature at the University of Essex, England,
she is Chairman of the Society for Latin
American Studies of Great Britain. She Is
the author of 'The Modern Culture of Latin
America: Society and the Artist" (revised
paperback edition, Penguin Books, U.K.,
1970) end "An Introduction to Spanish Ameri¬
can Literature" (1969), and the editor of
"Short Stories in Spanish" (Penguin, 1966).
T has become increasingly
difficult in the modern world to talk
of national or continental differences
in art, since national frontiers have
broken down and an international
style predominates. Further, it is
often as easy to see a painting by
Fernand Léger of France, in Caracas
as one by the Chilean, Roberto Matta,
in Paris or a Botero (of Colombia) in
New York. Yet, despite this growing
internationalism, Latin American art
is unique in that it represents a
confluence of indigenous, Western
European and North American styles.
The indigenous styles are those
which derive from pre-Columbian
sculpture, ceramics and painting, which
have provided a powerful source of
inspiration to certain contemporary
painters and sculptors.
At the same time, Latin American
art is also closely linked to Western
and North American art from
which it has derived styles such as
Impressionism, Cubism, Expressionism,
Abstractionism, Surrealism, Pop and
Op art. Even a movement like the
Mexican muraiist movement, which had
a strong nativist and genre element,
was influenced by Italian fresco
painting of the Renaissance, by
Cubism, Expressionism and even
Surrealism.
But perhaps what most clearly
distinguishes Latin American art are
the sociological factors, especially
those which concern the artist's
relation to his society. In many
countries, government patronage has
been more important than private
patronage. This was certainly the
case in Mexico in the nineteen-
twenties; it is the case in present-day
Cuba where private patronage has
virtually disappeared.
Yet even in countries like Brazil or
Venezuela where there Is substantial
private patronage, or very small
countries like Guatemala, the govern¬
ment has commissioned the decora¬
tion of public buildings, the con¬
struction of University cities or even
entire cities of the future like Brasilia.
The Mexican case Is particularly
interesting since Mexico was the first
Latin American country to stimulate
the creation of a "national art" as part
of a deliberate project in order to give
the people a sense of identity in the
post-Revolutionary era (that Is, after
1917).
On the other hand, private patron¬
age for Latin American art is a
recent phenomenon. As in literature,
nineteenth-century art was predomi¬
nantly European or European-inspired.
Wealthy Latin Americans bought their
paintings in Paris; public monuments in
squares or parks were commissioned
from European artists. The first
academies In Latin America established .*
after Independence were run by French I I
or Italian painters. The miracle Is that
a few native painters of genius (such
as José Maria Velasco, 1840-1912, of

The lake island of Mexcaltitan, in northwestern Mexico (left), completely covered by a village of shrimp

within the framework of a circular island. Above, today's urban designers have given the same "modern"
circular shape to the "pilot city" of Jupia, in Brazil. The city was built near Brazil's largest hydro-electric
project at Urubupungá, on the Parana river, and houses 12,000 dam construction workers and their families.
For the ceiling of this concert hall at

The Square of San Francisco, below, in Quito, Ecuador, is

fit into the surroundings.

ORIGINALITY
AND CONTRAST
IN LATIN AMERICAN
ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of Latin America has a
long tradition of originality going back
to pre-Columbian times with the pyra¬
mids of the Aztecs and Mayas, the
fortresses of Sachsahuaman at Cuzco
and the architectural ensemble at
Machu Picchu, in Peru, to cite only
three famous examples. The Colonial
period, lasting several hundred years
and inspired by Spanish and Portuguese
concepts, produced a new style of
Latin American baroque churches,
palaces and squares. Today's architects
of Latin America, too, at the same time
as they have studied and assimilated
the major trends of 20th century
architecture in the world, have sought
new and often revolutionary solutions
to town planning (as in Brasilia) and
urban architecture (as in Rio de Janeiro,
Mexico City, Caracas and many other
cities of Latin America). Just as
avant-garde Japanese architecture has
its deep roots in Japan's countryside
and traditions, so too have Latin
America's young architects sought to
integrate their new forms and concepts
with the more traditional models of
Latin America's past.
Modern tradition is a tradition of
dissent... In Latin America the
avant-garde violently rejects the
immediate past. But in reality it
is a circular process : the search
for the future always results in
a re-conquest of the past. Tradi¬
tion too is a creation of modern¬
ism. In other words, modernism
constructs its past with the same
violence that it builds its future.

PATHWAYS TO A NEW ART
(Continued from page 17)
Mexico) were able to develop In an
original way.
This imitation of foreign models,
common to all the arts in Latin
America, was the inevitable conse¬
quence of the continent's semi-colonial
status. The taste of potential patrons
was formed in Paris and they took
little interest in native talent before
the nineteen-twenties.
Yet all around them existed extra¬
ordinary native riches some archae¬
ological, like the pre-Columbian
ceremonial centres in the Andes or
Central America; or the baroque
sculpture and painting of the colonial
period; in the rural areas could be
seen the most diverse and exciting
examples of folk art, a folk art that is
often genuinely "mestizo" since it
combines Hispanic and Indian motifs.
Even today, the rural markets,
especially in the Andean countries, in
Mexico and Central America, offer fine
examples of folk painting, ceramic
sculpture, wood-carving, weaving and
pottery. Yet it was not until after
the Mexican Revolution that Latin
Americans began seriously to challenge
the norms of Western art and recognize
the value of their own traditions
whether of the past or whether
belonging to folk art.
The vigour of popular tradition is
nowhere more apparent than in the
engravings of the Mexican, José
Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913), whose
satirical works directly inspired the
Mexican murallst movement and,
indeed, a whole school of modern
engraving.
Posada drew on a purely folk
tradition on the macabre humour of
the skeleton figures which are sold
In Mexico to celebrate the Day of the
Dead as semi-comic mementi mori.
Posada decked out his skeleton
figures with the elegant hats and
clothes of pre-Revolutionary upper-
class Mexicans and so converted the
popular motif into social satire.
But it was the Mexican Revolution
(1910-1917) which really stimulated
both an interest in popular art and new
directions in painting and sculpture.
Artists such as Dr. Atl and Slqueiros
not only helped to introduce the
revolutionary concept of mural painting
but also fought In the Revolution
itself. When the fighting was over,
the Minister of Education in one of the
post-Revolutionary governments, José
Vasconcelos, commissioned murals for
the walls of the National Preparatory
School and other public buildings.
Moral and didactic in purpose, the
muraiist movement soon attracted the
three greatest talents of the period:
José Clemente Orozco (1883-1949),
Diego Rivera (1887-1957) and David
Alfaro Siqueiros (1898). Oddly,
perhaps ironically (considering the
anti-U.S. temper of the time), all of
these painters were as popular in the
United States as in their own country,
and all painted murals there Orozco
in Pomona College, Claremont, Cali¬
fornia, in the New School for Social
Research, New York, and at Dartmouth
College; Rivera in the San Francisco
Stock Exchange and the Rockefeller
Center and the Detroit Institute;
Siqueiros in Los Angeles at the Plaza
Art Center.
Although often linked together as
the main figures of the muraiist
movement, the three painters are in
fact very different. Orozco's work has
an explosive energy and violence
though he never sacrificed technique
to message. Many of his paintings
are, however, allegorical and many
are satirical and moral, attacking the
corrupt rich.
The murals he executed in Guadala¬
jara in the nineteen-thirties represent
the peak of his achievement, those
executed in the Government Palace
being powerfully satirical, and those
in the Hospicio Cabanas being
allegorical. Here he painted his
masterpiece on the theme of the four
elements. Three reclining figures,
depicting Earth, Water and Air,
surround Fire, a mural which fills the
dome of the edifice and shows flames
circling a human figure. The mural
is an excellent example of Orozco's
vigorous, dramatic and passionate
style.
By contrast, Rivera's murals were
lyrical, particularly In the 1920s
when he decorated the walls of the
Agricultural School of Chapingo with
the story of man's social development.
One of his most important murals,
however, Is the one he executed in
the National Palace in Mexico City,
where he painted the conquest and
the oppression of the Indian.
A painter whose colour and lines
can be tender and gentle, he often
turned to caricature in order to depict
the Spanish conquerors or the idle
rich (as in a famous mural in the Hotel
Prado, Mexico City, which for many
years remained covered up).
The third of the trio of muralists,
David Alfaro Siqueiros, has often
declared that he considers easel
paintings secondary to mural painting,
mere experiments for the larger work.
Nevertheless, he has painted a
considerable number of canvases,
many of them of a high quality.
Siqueiros' work Is noted for its
monumentality; he often uses great
shapes and likes to produce effects
of explosion, disruption or sinewy
strength. He has been one of the
most experimental of the muralists in
his search for new materials. Because
of his belief that painting is a form of
production, he has not hesitated to
adopt industrial techniques such as
the use of the spray gun.

The Mexican muraiist movement was
the first Latin American art movement
to spread its influence beyond the
national boundaries and it helped to
stimulate public commissions for
murals in other countries, and even
In the U.S.A. during the "New Deal"
period. Because of the strong "back
to the roots" tendency, encouraged by
post-Revolutionary nationalism, it also
revived figurative painting in which
there was a tendency to idealize
workers or peasants.
We find similar tendencies, however,
even in countries which had not
passed through a Revolutionary situ¬
ation. In Ecuador, Oswaldo Guaya-
samin followed on the tradition of
Mexican muralism, although much of
his work consisted of easel painting.
In Brazil, Cándido Portinari who, like
Siqueiros, painted strong figures of
workers pursuing their daily tasks, was,
in fact, influenced by contemporary
European art, particularly by Picasso's
"monumental" period.
The Cuban Revolution, like the
Mexican Revolution, encouraged art to
move away from easel painting towards
forms more readily accessible to the
people. Before the Revolution in
1959, Cuban art, whilst strongly
influenced by European (especially
French) art, was amongst the best in
Latin America. Among its avant-
garde were Victor Manuel, Amalia
Peláez, whose Matisse-like figures and
designs showed a remarkable use of
colour, Portocarrero, who was influ¬
enced by Futurism and Constructivism
and Wilfredo.Lam, a painter who used
motifs from Cuban African cults in
his works.
Almost all of these painters, though
they did not alter their styles after the
Revolution, began to work for a larger
public. They painted large canvases
for public buildings, designed biscuit
tins or posters. Indeed, it is in the
field of poster and book design that
contemporary Cuban painters and
artists have reached a mass public.
Quite a different path was followed
by painters and sculptors in most other
countries of Latin America where a
high value was placed on technique
and less importance was attached to
reaching a mass public. The pioneers
here were the Brazilians who, in 1922,
held a Modern Art Week in Säo Paulo.
This encouraged a number of painters,
influenced by Fauvism and Futurism.
But soon quite original trends
developed. With Tarsilo de Amaral
(1894), there developed the delightful
Antropofagia (Cannibalistic) move¬
ment, a kind of Brazilian response to
European myths about tropical America.
The Modern Art Week put Säo Paulo
on the cultural map and this city later
became the home of the Biennale
exhibition.
Another Latin American offshoot of
Modernism was Constructivism whose
main exponent was the Uruguayan
artist, Torres-García for whom the
essence of art was "to construct
according to the law of limitations."
As is the case with the literary
movement often known as "magical
realism", surrealism and certain
other European movements served to
encourage Latin Americans to achieve
a new vision of their own continent.
This was true even in Mexico where
along with the muraiist movement,
there flourished painters such as
Rufino Tamayo (1899) who developed
a totally personal art, initially influ¬
enced by Picasso.
Although Tamayo spent some years
in New York and was recognized In
the United States before he was
recognized In Mexico, his colours and
elements are wholly Mexican without

"La Casa de Anáhuac",a museum conceived by the great Mexican painter Diego Rivera as
a storehouse of 4,000 years of Mexican popular art, bears striking witness to Rivera's
passionate artistic ideal of a "return to the roots." Anáhuac was the original Aztec name
for Mexico, but today it is applied to the vast central Mexican plateau. Built in the village
of San Pablo Tepetlapa on the outskirts of the capital, the museum perpetuates the
memory of the painter, seen here, as if through a window, in the photo-portrait on the wall.

A hard-hitting article on art
and the artist in Latin America
CAGE BARS
OF REALITY
by Jorge Enrique Adoum
NlABOKOV tells how "... the
first palpitation (of Lolita) was provok¬
ed by reading a newspaper article
relating that a scientist, after months
of effort, had succeeded in making a
large ape in the Jardin des Plantes
(in Paris) sketch a drawing; this
sketch, the first ever produced by an
animal, represented the bars of the
poor beast's cage."
The same seems to happen with
men whenever they are treated like
apes who have to be "taught" to
create; consider the inexhaustible
wealth of invention in popular art or
rebel art compared with the produc¬
tions of any institutionalized art.
Arnold von Salis, among others,
remarked on the imaginative poverty
of Greek art which '"saw no further
than the end of its nose", i.e. no further
than the cage bars.
In "pre-Latin" America, where the
artist was really integrated into his
society and performed an irreplace¬
able function in it, evidence of an
amazing creative imagination can be
seen in the huge otone edifices or
sculptures, pottery, textiles, and gold
and silver work of the Maya, Aztec,
Inca or Aymará cultures. With the
JORGE ENRIQUE ADOUM, Ecuadorian poet
and writer. Is the author of some ten books,
including a 4-volume poetic cycle, 'Los Cua¬
dernos de la Tierra" (Notebooks on my
Country, 1952-1962), and a critical work,
"Poesia del Siglo XX" (Poetry of the 20th
Century, 1957). A former National Director
for Culture at Ecuador's Ministry of Edu¬
cation, he has also been Director of the
Publications Division of Ecuador's Institute
of Culture and Secretary of Its Theatre and
Folklore Institute. He Is now assistant editor
of the Spanish edition of the "Unesco
Courier" and Is collaborating in Unesco's
studies on Latin American culture.
Spanish conquest the first cultural
colonialism set local craftsmen to
mass-produce, In their workshops
and schools, the images needed to
furnish the churches which other
Indians were building Under the direc¬
tion of foreign architects to plans
brought from Spain and Portugal.
Quite touching efforts are made by
certain Latin American critics to dis¬
cover some trace of Indian personality
in the religious art of that period;
the baroque and plateresque colonial
churches have even been called "a
rebellion of stone".
With some rare exceptions like
Aleijadinho, whose incredible Prophets
reveal an originality infinitely superior
to the Iberian peninsular and flamenco
models, the most that can be found
is some tropical bird, animal or plant
added surreptitiously by Indian sculp¬
tors In the bas-reliefs of churches.
The legend of Miguel de Santiago,
which fills the Ecuadorians with awe,
is merely an extreme example of the
cage-bars story; he is said to
have stabbed his model in order to
"capture" the agonized features for
a canvas of Christ.
Official art of course expresses the
imposed order and the colonized
artist reluctantly submits to both: the
major figures of Latin American col¬
onial art were little more than skilled
craftsmen producing goods for a
market that was also their master
the Crown, the Court or the Church.
Yet the true artistic creator was the
people: cut off In their island the
inhabitants of Puna went on decorat¬
ing their clay beads with fabulous
geometrical animals, and the Easter
Islanders erected mysterious giant
idols in the sand; the anonymous
popular prints of Brazil depicted
figures from a strange mythology
peopled with "lobisones", standing
lizards and zoomorphic demons. Later,
Posada's engraving drew on the fune¬
rary and funereal images of Mexican
popular art. They were able to see
further than the realities of man and
nature.
Independence from Spain and Por¬
tugal did not basically alter social
structures, nor was there any change
in the mentality of the colonized artist;
he began to paint military heroes
instead of images, but the technique
was still that imposed on him.
Then came landscapes (in which
the wild scenery of America appears
as placid as a Dutch landscape),
scenes of creóle life (sometimes paint¬
ed by a lawyer politician like the Uru¬
guayan Pedro Figari), genre paintings
which helped to create abroad the
image of a "typism" regarded at home
as originality, and which were pure
European impressionism.
T ROM the nineteen thirties
onwards art faces social reality the
collective prison, the common grave,
the real horror of our countries with
the declared intention of helping to
change the rule of injustice and the
rule of official art with it.
In the "proletarian academicism" of
realist painting, the Indians or Negroes
in Latin America began to be depicted
at work or being murdered which,
for them, was often the same thing, y X

SKULL IN FINERY
WOMAN IN TEARS
The Ecuadorian artist Oswaldo Guayasamin (b. 1919) has depicted
the harsh life of the Indian woman in Latin America in a series
of paintings entitled "Women in Tears". Right, one of these
paintings. A very popular artist, in every sense of the term, is
the Mexican engraver, José Guadalupe Posada, who died in 1913.
In Mexico there is a popular tradition that death is not a gloomy
affair. Posada used this custom of treating death In a casual
light-hearted manner to smite injustice with satire and irony in his
famous engravings of skulls and skeletons "Los Calaveras". The
skull wearing a gaily decorated hat in Posada's "Calavera Catrina"
(left) is a thrust at vanity and a reminder that all ends in dust
CAGE BARS OF REALITY (Continued)
their own personal cell and the bars
of individual conflicts did the artist
manage to regain in society the place
that had belonged to the creator of
the past, who had expressed himself
and his people at the same time.
This is not a question of subject
or technique. I have seen building
labourers from the country laughing
at a realist mural of agricultural work
on the building on which they were
employed. Realist art is no more "pop¬
ular" than non-figurative art, just as
the novel about the Indians of Latin
America is no more widely read than
avant-garde poetry.
But if the absence of a reading
public may be partly due to illiteracy,
in the case of art we have to admit
that although it may seem easier to
look at a picture than to read a book,
an art gallery does not attract any
more people than a library.
Art is today a test of culture: we
cannot even say that everyone
who reads visits an exhibition; that
other illiteracy, which appeases its
appetite for reading with romances or
Westerns, satisfies its need for art
with the calendars or colour prints of
landscapes, dogs, flowers or nudes
that decorate cobblers' workshops or
house corridors and kitchens.
I
24
F the organizers of the
Toronto survey (see the "Unesco
Courier", March 1971) found to their
chagrin that between artistic innovation
and its general public acceptance
there is a gap of at least fifty years,
just think how long it will take in our
countries, many of which have no mu¬
seum of modern art, many of whose
art colleges have never seen a good
reproduction and whose teaching of the
history of painting has to make do
with the black-and-white reproductions
in the cheapest books.
As for the works of Latin American
artists, in the colonial period they
went to the courts of Spain and Por
tugal or the American viceroys; or
else they formed part of religious
architecture the only way they could
come In contact with the public who,
as may easily be supposed, regarded
them as religious objects rather than
works of art.
Today they are kept in a few private
collections or are used in municipal
architecture or urbanism. Only occa¬
sionally, however, does the State
commission works to decorate public
buildings, and these inspire the work¬
ing classes with greater fear and
mistrust than galleries or museums,
perhaps because there is often a
guard at the door. Or they are plac¬
ed in the office of the Minister or
Director-General, to which the public
is not admitted.
The customers of art dealers and
art galleries consist almost exclusively
of foreign collectors. And through the
law of supply and demand or because
of outside influences, or because even
here "the customer is always right",
not a few artists have had to submit
to the fluctuations of market require¬
ments, ranging from a predilection for
fashionable European trends to the
imposition of a "local style", non-
observance of which, as the Director
of the Guggenheim Museum reported,
makes many North American tourists
exclaim: "They paint like everybody
else. What a pity!"
Thus Schücking's remark about
artists who are democrats in politics
and aristocrats in culture is nowhere
truer than in Le'!n America; outcast
they and then* work from their
society, forced into exile within it, not
so much through rejection which is
already a positive intellectual attitude,
as through indifference or ignorance,
they work for an élite to which they
still do not belong nor wish to belong.
They spring from the middle class
and share its divisions and privileges.
But even there their personal situation
is an awkward one. Because their art
is closer to a handicraft, the social
stigma attaching to manual work In the
eyes of colonial society earns them
the scorn of the upper middle class
for whom literature may be in good
taste.
Yet the marketable value of his
work enables the artist to devote
most of his time to it and also to
engage in various sidelines which earn
him the indifference of the lower
middle class from whom he becomes
alienated. The State seldom recogni¬
zes the artist's existence, unless he
seems to be a threat to the established
order; then a government may be
proud of a painter's work, yet imprison
him for supporting as a citizen the
ideas he portrays in his painting; or
the authorities may decide to obliterate
the mural they commissioned. In this
case not only right but might is on the
side of the customer.
Bi the situation of the Lat¬
in American artist is far more painfully
dramatic and has no parallel anywhere
else. The cultural genocide committed
by the conquistadors lay in cutting the
roots. What might have been tradi¬
tions are merely relics of a past
without continuity. They left the Latin
American artist little to inherit; they
forced him to practise a foreign art
and then accused him of stealing.
And he became so "mixed up" that
he began to cultivate locally the
models transplanted from abroad and
tried to invent a tradition, if only for
a hybrid art.
His drama is the conflict between
seeking his identity as a member of
a society "in definition" and his
authenticity as a creator or in other
words, the dilemma between the need
to belong and the instinct to explore.
These two tendencies, which are not
necessarily opposed Rufino Tamayo
and Wilfredo Lam, for instance, have
managed to reconcile necessity and
freedom gave rise to the only two
organized art movements in Latin
America: Mexican muralism, which

adapted European realism to express
the historical and social realities of
our countries, and Rio de la Plata
constructive universalism, which set
out to create "a synthesis of the posi¬
tive features of neoplasticism,' cubism
and surrealism".
After initial successes In seeking
social documents and experimenting
with plastic techniques, each of these
movements went too far, tending on
the one hand towards a paternalist
aboriginalism reminiscent of the be¬
haviour of societies for the protection
of animals, and on the other (especially
after the constructivism of Torres
Garcia) towards an individual original¬
ity which deliberately ignored the
slaughter going on a few yards from
the studio window.
Until quite recently realism was
regarded as a Latin American tradition
and David Alfaro Siqueiros could
affirm that "there is no road but ours".
Realism the photograph of a situation
which had remained more or less
static (apart from Cuba) became the
painter's official curriculum vitae even
if reality was portrayed merely In the
form of misfortune or natural disaster.
It was, however, the first denuncia¬
tion of the shameful social reality
of our "grievous republics", and its
triumph belatedly celebrated at a
Venice Biennale was "the triumph of
a moral world" but certainly not of
an art trend.
It was a question of that form for
that subject. No one would have
regarded it as an individual expression
of America if it had been concerned
with still life or realistic fictional
representations (as though the Goya
of "The Execution of the Rebels of
May 3, 1808" and of the bitlngly
satirical etchings, "Los Caprichos",
were not the same). And perhaps it
would not have reached the same
heights If the institutionalization of the
Mexican Revolution had not fostered
historical and anecdotal muralism.
While in the countries bordering the
Pacific, especially those with an
indigenous population, art was
generally regarded as a compromise,
although it sometimes substituted
social reality for an idealization of
historical truth, in the countries of the
Atlantic seaboard, economically more
advanced and retaining fewer traces
of feudalism, artistic reality was
emphasized as a "thing" in itself.
Artistic sectarianism accused non-
figurative art of pandering to the taste
of the bourgeoisie, but the same bour¬
geoisie bought realist pictures simply
because they were a good investment.
As for what might be called the public,
realism left its conscience untroubled;
it presented as one facet of society

the martyred multitudes of history
and as the other, the symbols of
economic, political and religious
power. The rest remained outside the
picture in the comfortable position of
spectators. Abstract art did not affect
them.
Then a new art form appeared
"the identity photograph of a society
that can equally well engage in a
cruel war or enjoy the pornography
of illusions instead of facing reality",
as the Argentine art critic, Damián Car¬
los Bayon, has put it, "and in whose
images we recognize ourselves and
in alarm peer keenly into the mirror
to see If it is really our ¡mage."
Then in order to reject it, the call goes
up again for an art for the people. In
the end they want realism, not truth,
which is not the same thing.
In many of our countries, whatever
the intensity of nationalist feeling,
there Is an inferiority complex, even
if it is only the reaction of an ado¬
lescent to an adult. Art expresses
this in a swing of the pendulum:
either taking a pride in one's misfor¬
tunes, like a beggar displaying his
sores, or stretching up on tiptoe to
be as tall as Europe, as though this
were the unbeatable model, and the
clearest sign of this is that gesture
seeming to imply. "We can do it too".
One has to admit that Latin America
has produced no original art movement
since the time of the aboriginal
cultures, although there have been
original artists in the various trends.
And so since the loss of tradition,
there is no pure strain to preserve,
even by force, as is happening with
Latin American Indian music. And
there is no possible escape from the
art of the rest of the world, since
there are no islands free from the
contamination of that cold and almost
mechanical impersonalism that is its
salient characteristic today.
I T is absurd to claim to
preserve the purity of art alone in a
culture which has already adopted
other such alien features as language,
religion and customs. In general, the
only result of these efforts has been
to dis-inter a mode of expression that
has been preserved as it was before
the conquests and then to care for it
like a lifeless museum piece.
Incorporated despite all contradic¬
tions into "Western civilization", it is
not surprising that some Latin Amer¬
ican artists found that their artistic
conceptions coincided with those of
some European art movements. In¬
fluences are then more inevitable than
ever. What revolts us is the massive
export of artistic byproducts. It is sad
to see the popular crafts copying
worthless foreign models because that
is what the market wants: the "images
d'Epinal" were converted into some¬
thing like the typical plastic lan¬
guage of our working classes; the
labels on Havana cigar boxes somehow
or other echo Italian neoclassical
allegory; Catholic devotional pictures
show Virgins made up like film stars;
Donald Duck appears on local pottery;
the carpet-makers of Ecuador have
replaced their own designs by floral
motifs from foreign catalogues.
Some examples of non-popular art,
on the other hand, are a gigantic
fraud; in the heart of tropical Latin
America there is a "Gothic" cathedral
of reinforced concrete and in one of
the countries with the strongest Indian
tradition, there is a "Byzantine" cathe¬
dral with "Chinese" towers.
In the past, European art trends took
a long time to cross the Atlantic and
reached Latin America so belatedly
that they were treated as new when
they were already outmoded in their
countries of origin. Herbert Read re¬
fused to include the Mexican muralists
Siqueiros, Rivera and Orozco in his
History of Modern Painting (and the
French painter Utrillo too, for that
matter).
Today, easier and more frequent
travel, prompted by the need to know
what is happening abroad a tendency
which is not to be blamed in view of
the indifference if not hostility of the
environment, the lack of museums and
information, the scarcity of genuine
criticism, neither superficial nor im¬
provised, and the almost childish need
to make comparisons in order to feel
reassured has reduced the time lag
between Latin American art and other
countries.
And so in Latin America, as in Europe
and the United States, there is a
search for movement in place of
immobility (the Argentineans Pettoruti,
Aizenberg, Fernandez Muro),- the re¬
habilitation of surfaces (the Brazilian
Camargo), op art (from the optical
illusions of the Venezuelan Soto to
the mechanical constructions of the
Argentinean Le Parc), and the desire
for the work to be transformed "from
an object into a spectacle", as found
in the compositions with spectator
participation produced by the Argen¬
tinian Antonio Seguí, or in the Uni
versity of Caracas with its transport¬
able, expandable lecture halls.
Such travel, with which writers are
usually reproached more bitterly, is of
vital importance in the development
of the Latin American artist; he feels
less cut off from the rest of the world
and yet he has not lost his citizen¬
ship.
The "unbridled creation of tropical
shapes" of the Cuban Wilfredo Lam
might perhaps be inexplicable without
the teaching and personal influence of
. Picasso and Andre Breton. The paint¬
ing of the Chilean Roberto Matta and
his "critique of daily life comparable
with that of Daumier" owes much to
Marcel Duchamp. Kracjberg, in whose
works "the material as well as the
the illusion is volcanic", is a Brazi¬
lian who was born near Warsaw and
has lived in Minsk, Vitebsk, Leningrad,
Stuttgart, Paris, Säo Paulo and Parana.
Kazuya Sakai, in whose geometrical
rigour "painting has being not mean¬
ing", was born in Buenos Aires, edu¬
cated in Japan and lived in New York
and Mexico.
Carpentier, in his
introduction to "The Kingdom of this
World", says that "because of the vir¬
ginity of the landscape, its formation,
ontology, and the Faustian presence of
the Indian and the Negro, the Revela¬
tion of its recent discovery and the
fertile crossbreeding it fostered, Amer¬
ica is very far from having exhausted
its store of mythologies."
For that very reason it is very far
from having discovered all its reality.
The new art is helping to complete
the picture of this continent which is
not exclusively agricultural, which has
not remained stuck in the Corn Age,
which does not wish to be shut into
an exotic folklore to please the art
tourists and the foreign TV camera¬
men.
Because we have never been asked
our names and we ourselves are be¬
ginning to call ourselves by the names
they gave us Terra Firma, Hispano-
America, Indo-America, Latin America,
Third World, Developing Countries
we may have believed for a long time
that we are what others imagine and
see ourselves as they insist on seeing
us from outside.
If art has always been a means of
self-knowledge, we shall have to go on
trying to find ourselves in an art that
seeks to express not only the work
we do but the essence of what we
are.

THE NEW
LANGUAGE
OF LATIN AMERICAN
by
Rubén Bareiro Saguier LITERATURE
H,IISTORICALLY, Latin Amer¬
ican culture is a mixture of Spanish
and Portuguese traditions grafted on
to the many-branched tree of Amer¬
ican Indian culture, which little by
little it absorbed along with later
African elements and traces of mi¬
grations from other parts of the world.
This diversity has been at the root

a literary critic and writer, and the author
of many critical essays on literature. He is
at present Professor of Latin American Lit¬
erature at Vincennes University, Paris. His
latest work is a book of short stories. "Ojo

of a fundamental problem that has
troubled Latin Americans over the
years and continues to do so today
namely, the search for a cultural
identity. This is apparent in Latin
American literature, with its long
search for a new language of
expression, and the translation of
ideas into an idiom to a certain extent
foreign within a political context
devoid of unity.
"Western culture" that is, the
sum of values and norms introduced
by the conquerors was imposed
upon America. In this meeting of
substantially different cultures, the
cultural divergence was undoubtedly
one of the most extreme ever known
in the Christian era. It was all the
more dramatic because, thanks to
the technical superiority of their fire¬
arms, thanks to the wheel and the
horse, a handful of Europeans con¬
quered hundreds of thousands of
Americans, many of them organized
into powerful nations.
At the same time, it was the ration¬
alist culture of the Renaissance that
came into contact with the magic
universe of the Indians. The com¬
plexity of this relationship might explain
the conflict in which that experience
which contributed to the creation of
a Latin American cultural identity was
lived.

in literary expression leads to the
problem of the independence of
Latin American letters. Are they not
simply offshoots of metropolitan
literature? To what extent does Latin
American literature exist as an inde¬
pendent totality?
The doubt arises, in the first place,
because our literature is expressed
in a language defined by the qualify¬
ing term "Spanish", a term which
has an unmistakable historical and
political context. This tradition an
important element in defining identity
is alien to us, something borrowed.
This is aggravated by the absence of
Spanish-American unity, that is to
say, of the single national basis of
Spanish literature.
In reality, the language system as it
relates to a concrete world, increases
in complexity as it "adapts itself to the
world it expresses". In this way,
both languages, the Peninsular and
the American, are simply variants of
the same system, but variants which
reveal different and independent ex¬
periences. Hence the diversity of both
literatures, associated by ' a common
system and separated by the variants
and reflecting different historical uni¬
verses.
The break in Peninsular linguistic
purity, both in the dominions of Spain
and in Brazil in which there is not
only evidence of Indian speech but
also of Negro influence is extremely
important for the later evolution of
Latin American literature and, to a
great extent, for the present quest for
expression.
The linguistic break Is critical and
becomes a conscious programme
Immediately after Independence. In
effect, as early as 1825, people speak
of the "Brazilian language" and a little
later, in Spanish America, of the
"national language" especially in
Argentina and Mexico.
It was the Modernist movement which
was to break with the linguistic purity
of Spanish American literature in a
conscious manner and within the area
of high culture. If the Romantic
"nativists" intuitively regenerate the
language, the Modernists do so delib¬
erately, through their aesthetic ex¬
plorations. While ideologically Roman¬
ticism was anti-Spanish, Modernism
was pro-French and Its greatest repre¬
sentative, Rubén Darío, gladly accept¬
ed the accusation of "mental galli¬
cism" applied to his school.
w ITH the generation of 98,
Spain recognized the value of the
Modernist experience and introduced
it into the Iberian Peninsular. It was
the first time that the former colonies
had imposed their cultural patterns on
the old metropolis; the direction of
influence had been reversed.
The American origin of the Modern¬
ist renewal does not depend on indi¬
genous, local or native elements.
Essentially cosmopolitan and refined,
Modernism denied immediate reality
Darío expressed it thus: "I detest
the life and the time into which I
have been born" and where it call¬
ed upon such elements, it was in the
same spirit of exoticism that inspired
references to the East or to Greek
and Latin antiquity.
In Brazil, the speech of the ethnic
minorities of the country has been
a more important source of literary
language. The Brazilian Modernists
looked towards indigenous and Negro
cultures in order to borrow words
and expressions from the former,
rhythms, structures and images of
MIGUEL ANGEL
ASTURIAS
Guatemalan novelist and poet, and
Nobel Prizewinner 1967, he combines
in his writings the mysticism of the
Indians and the militancy of social
protest. Three of his most important
novels have been translated into
English: "The President", translated
by Frances Partridge (Victor Gollancz,
London, 1963), "The Green Pope",
translated by Gregory Rabassa (Dela-
cote Press, New York, 1971), and "The
Mulatto and Mister Fly", translated by
Gregory Rabassa (Harmondsworth-Pen
guin Books, London, 1970).

expression as well as the lexical
element from the latter.
The initiation In Brazil of what is
known as Afro-Brazilian literature
occurs at the same time as Afro-
Antillean literature: Luis Palés Matos,
Ramón Guirao, Emilio Ballagas, Nico¬
lás Guillen, José Tallet.
Referring to these movements, the
Haitian writer, René Depestre, des¬
cribes their "use of rhythmic elements
of onomatopoeia and of sensorial ele¬
ments proper to the oral literature of
the Negro. This signals the initiation
of the 'Negro theme' as a literary
fashion." Among the writers mention¬
ed, Nicolás Guillen is outstanding since
the content of his works reflects his
mulatto condition and thus transcends
Africanism.
Literary Indigenism which emerges
in the Spanish American novel around
the 1920s and 1930s, was, from the
point of view of stylistic expression,
more timid and colourless than Afri¬
canism. In reality, despite the ideo¬
logy of protest on behalf of the Indian,
the language continued to be that of
Modernism with modifications in its
development because of naturalist and
positivist influences.
Indigenous words were used; the
writing was larded with more or less
indigenous expression but the select¬
ive criteria continued to be the same
as Modernist exoticism. Sympathy for
the Indian did not go beyond the
framework of a superficial interest and
did not extend to the investigation of
the components of their culture.
By using the myth-coloured speech
of the Indians, Miguel Angel Asturias
blew open the language of the Latin
American narrative. Having gone to
the roots of maya-quiché culture,
Asturias demonstrated the magic value
of the word in that civilization. Fur-

PABLO NERUDA
Nobel Prizewinner 1971, Pablo Neruda
is a Chilean poet who is concerned
with harried, exploited, alienated man.
Among the major works of this prolific
writer the most important published
so far In English is his "Canto
General", translated by Nathaniel Tarn
and published under the title "The
Heights of Machu Picchu", Jonathan
Cape, London (1966). Several selec¬
tions of his poems have also been
published in English including: "Select¬
ed Poems", edited by Nathaniel Tam
and translated by Anthony Kerrigan
and others (Jonathan Cape, London,
1970), "The Early Poems", translated
by David Osman and Carlos B. Hagen
(Rivers Press, New York, 1969), and
"A New Decade of Poems, 1958-1967",
translated by Ben Belitt and Alaister
Reid (Grove Press, New York, 1969).
ther, by assuming this sacred function
and translating it into a literary plane,
Asturias Increased the power of lan¬
guage, of a language which is generat¬
ed by Inherent laws.
This is creation through and within
the word, as American Indian culture
conceives it. The work of Asturias
and his masterpiece, Hombres de
maíz (Men of Maize) is the clear¬
est example of the indigenous cultural
contribution to Spanish American
literary language.
Two other contemporary writers
have had the same impact as Asturias
although In a more discreet, a more
underground manner: José María
Arguedas and Augusto Roa Bastos.
The former is a Peruvian whose mother
tongue was Quechua and who recre¬
ates the marvellous world of the sierra
Indians. He writes in a Spanish that
Is poured into the moulds of the
aboriginal language.
Arguedas attempted to define his
style thus: "I wrote in a type of Castil¬
lan which is not that of a mixed lan¬
guage but of a mixed style in which
the spirit and the characteristics of
Quechua are clearly vibrant, are clear¬
ly evident within the Castilian style."
The Spanish professor, Antonio
Tovar, has made a prediction about
"the languages which could emerge
in America". It Is based on the "hope
that at least in areas that are now
remote, in those profound and rich
deposits of old traditions, this fruit¬
ful fusion of cultures and of langua¬
ges will be kept free and alive."
Another phenomenon the contem¬
porary determination to realize the
synthesis of almost five centuries of
warring cultural existence through lit¬
erary expression is worth serious
reflection and analysis, although this
is a project still to be realized.
Never was awareness of the task
so acute as in the works of the pre¬
sent generation. "We live in countries
where everything is still to be said,
but In which we still have to discover
how to say this everything. If, in
a Latin American novel, there is no
striving after an original language, then
It does not exist for me," declares
the Mexican novelist, Carlos Fuentes.
The path seems to be that of bring¬
ing the written language closer to liv¬
ing speech, a task which is slow and
difficult.
I HE contemporary writers
who have come to the fore since 1945,
base their literary creation on linguistic
innovation. This means that literature
is progressively appropriating an
already-existing cultural heritage; a
collective creation which is the result
of constant borrowings and grafted
onto the trunk of the mother tongue.
The so-called "degeneration of the
language" an old colonialist myth
is thus shown to be fruitful.
Language even the literary lan¬
guage is not a capricious invention
but a historical product. In this
sense, the most recent writers, by
breaking the linear development of
language, testify to a present reality
that is characterized by the increasing
complexity of the Latin American
world. And this is also valid for
Brazil where, from the extreme inno¬
vations of the Modernists onwards,
the literary language went through a
process similar to that of Spanish
America.
The breakthrough which permitted
these writers to appropriate collo¬
quial and regional language accounts
for the emergence of a writer like
Joäo Guimaräes Rosa who was able
to make the speech of the Brazilian
North East into a universal instrument.
The sertäo (backlands) was one of
the last strongholds where Portuguese
met up with indigenous and African
languages. Guimaräes Rosa uses the
substratum of this spoken language
to construct the long narrative-mono¬
logue of Riobaldo (which is more
appropriately heard than read) in his
Gran sertäo veredas (The Devil To
Pay in the Backlands).
The possible limitations of this folk
and colloquial speech are overcome
by great Inventive skill and by the
poetic energy of the novelist who
uses words as stimulants, as free
suggestions, rather than as fixed
categories.
The theme which is the second
factor selected in order to analyse
the phenomenon of the meeting of
cultures in Latin American literature
rapidly becomes the key to the defi¬
nition of what is American and, as
will be obvious, becomes the pro¬
gramme of literary emancipation.
From the beginning of the nine¬
teenth century up to the present, many
writers have seen the problem of lit¬
erary independence, as one of "dis¬
covering a continent" through the des¬
cription of the geographical and social
environment. Furthermore, some cri¬
tics have emphasized the telluric in
the definition of our literature, thus
giving precedence to the "content"
aspect as a synonym of "authen¬
ticity".
The vision of Latin America during nn
the colonial period was generally ¿Jq
idyllic or, in any case, out of touch
with reality. With Independence, the
vision fundamentally changes and is

more in touch with reality. The Latin
American Romantic generation espe¬
cially Andrés Bello in Spanish-speak¬
ing Latin America and Gonçalves de
Magalhäes In Brazil outline a definite
programme: the new literature should
match the new political reality.
The programme of the Romantics
a literature with an American theme
and content represents a search for
continental identity, geared towards a
future and with a concept of America
as a complete whole.
The Romantic programme of "lit¬
erary independence" is carried out pre¬
cisely by the writers who emerge in
the second decade of the twentieth
century, from the period of the Mexi¬
can Revolutionary novel onwards.
These also assume an essentially
ethical approach and attempt, like the
Romantics, to seek an American
literary identity in theme and content.
The analogy no longer applies be¬
yond this point because naturally
times have changed and ideologies
have been transformed.
When the generation of writers
which J. A. Portuondo defines as "the
generation of social problems" emerg¬
ed, the Mexican Revolution was at its
height; soon after, the Russian Revol¬
ution broke out, and in Spanish Amer¬
ica the University Reform movement
got under way. These political events
profoundly affect the works of the
period, determining the overriding in¬
terest of the writers in social themes
and specifically determining the com¬
mitted nature of that literature.

OWEVER, part of this
fiction the so called "novel of the
land" follows an identical line to that
of the nineteenth-century in its admir¬
ation for wild nature which must, at
the same time, be conquered in order
to make it productive.
In any case, the greater part of
this literature is definitely political;
it is a literature that denounces
and protests. Further, the historical
situation had changed since the period
of the Romantic generation. Spain
had ceased to be the target for
Spanish American writers. The
colonial period was far off. The period
in which there emerges the generation
of "social problems" coincides with
foreign penetration and armed
intervention.
Anti-colonialist literature was written
which denounced invasion or the
miserable conditions in which the
exploited population lived in the mines,
in the banana plantations or the
petroleum fields. The disturbing
fresco of continental exploitation was
depicted hurriedly, indignantly with
twisted, caricatural, grotesque per¬
sonages through whom the writer
hoped to state his protest and to
regenerate man rather than to create
a novelistic world.

cultivated a type of narrative that was
exactly equivalent to that of their
Spanish American contemporaries.
The most important are the "North¬
eastern" novelists Graciliano Ramos,
José Lins do Regó, Jorge Amado.
Within this social tendency, it is
interesting to pick out the Indigenist
stream which is especially relevant to
our theme. What differentiates these
social works from the idealized
Romantic position of the Indianists is
in their emphasis on the real problem
of the Indian as an outsider in a class
society.
It has been pointed out already that,
on the linguistic plane, Indigenism did
not give rise to very convincing works.
Similarly, thematically, it suffered from
undeniable faults; a caricatural dualism,
a predominantly humanitarian approach
which attempted to defend the Indians
from exploitation and at the same time
condemned their culture by implication,
by proposing that they be levelled
up to and integrated within "white"
society.
The reaction was foreseeable.
Indigenism had been based on the
classical, ethnocentric theories of the
West. The authors who transcended
these limitations Arguedas, Asturias
are those who exposed the essence
of indigenous culture by measuring
the continuing validity of the structures
of these civilizations.
Another occasion when the prob¬
lematic meeting of cultures as a
theme appears in Latin American
literature occurs with the emergence
of the black question. We have
already seen the birth of Africanism
as an expressive instrument of African
rhythms. Later there arises négritude
which attempts to explain the deep
roots as the consequence of that
cultural shock.
This new attitude accuses Africanism
of having retained only the superficial,
folklore aspects of the Negro condition
in America. It preaches a spirit of
rebellion in order to realize a "search
for identity". This is most fully
realized in West Indian literature
especially that in French; in Spanish,
writers such -as Nicolás Guillen and
Adalberto Ortiz are worth mentioning.
The ethical position of négritude puts
it in the current of the "social problem"
stream in Spanish American literature.

<![CDATA[
To sum up, the search for literary
identity through the production of a
social and committed novel represents
an important step in the process of
identifying that social reality. But it
was, to a certain extent, an erroneous
search. The very criterion of "docu¬
mentary truth" that was adopted was
deceptive because It represented a
surface deformed by the redemptionist
intention which the author imposed.
In this sense, the term "sociological
literature" also attributed to it, is
dubious.
José Carlos Mariátegui had already
warned of the danger of a realism that
drew away from reality. And we have
not even mentioned the weaknesses
whose evil consequences are still with
us which resulted from the attempt
to found the authenticity of the Latin
American writer on telluric and protest
factors.
This leads us to consideration of the
"content" aspect as conceived and put
into practice by novelists who began
to write about 1945. Contemporary
Latin American writers are in the
process of making a synthesis by
drawing on a multiplicity of cultural
borrowings, on the tensions which
have arisen from these conflictive
encounters, on previous experience
and on the wish to penetrate deeper
and to experiment. The result is that
their vision of reality is enriched by
their multiple approach to it.
IS ORGES described the
transition from one conception of
literature to another with an ironic
and lucid phrase: "reality is not always
local." Recognizing the diversity and
complexity of the social and cultural
environment, writers have renounced
superficial description and explicit
moral statement. Instead, they stress
the discontinuity, contradictions and
doubts that mark the social and cul¬
tural limits of an underdeveloped
continent which oscillates between
the opposites poles of revolution and
total dependence.
Their procedure is often to use basic
cultural ingredients. Thus the under¬
lying, distilled thematic presence of
Indian mythological symbols can be
detected in a great many present-
day works, especially by Mexicans
(Fuentes, Rulfo, Arreóla, Yáñez) and
in writers of other countries like
Arguedas and Roa Bastos. I am not
here alluding to direct utilization (of
the legendary element) but to its
literary transmutation and adaptation
to the contemporary situation in
function of the narrative.
Seen in this way, the theme or
content of literature can be considered
a defining element of Latin American
literary identity because it is the result
of a great diversity of cultural contri¬
butions, and as such is always open
to new developments.
LITERATURE AND
UNDERDEVELOPMENT (Continued from page 15)
from Max Bense; nevertheless, it has
led to a redefinition of the national
past and has permitted unknown poets
to be read in a new way and has
aptly shed light on the stylistic
revolution of the great Modernists,
Mario de Andrade and Oswald de
Andrade.
Considered as a consequence of
backwardness and lack of economic
development, dependence presents
other aspects which have repercus¬
sions on literature. Let us once more
note the phenomenon of ambivalence
which is expressed in the impulse both
to copy and to turn away from the
model; apparently contradictory when
seen in isolation, they may appear
complementary from another point of
view.
Backwardness which stimulates the
servile copying of all that the fashion
in advanced countries decrees, also
encourages writers to emigrate, whe¬
ther to the interior or to the exterior.
Backwardness, which concentrates on
the most idiosyncractic aspects of
national identity, and may really be an
unsuspected way of offering the ex¬
oticism that European sensibility wants
as a distraction, turns into an acute
form of dependence within indepen¬
dence. From the present perspective,
it appears that the two tendencies are
the same and arise from the same
situation of backwardness or under¬
development.
In its crudest form, the servile imita¬
tion of styles, themes and attitudes
and literary habits is laughable or limit¬
ed by provincialism, having been the
mere compensatory elitism of a colo¬
nial country.
Equally crude, though perhaps in
another way, are certain elementary
forms of nativism and literary region¬
alism which reduce human problems
to their picturesque element, transform¬
ing the passion and suffering of rural
man and the coloured populations to
the equivalents of tropical pineapple or
pawpaw.
This attitude may not only be anal¬
ogous to the first but also combined
with it, once it results in supplying
the urban or European reader or
the artificially Europeanized with the
almost tourist reality which he would
like to see in America.
Yet in Latin America, as a
consequence of underdevelopment,
regionalism was and still is a stimulus
to literature. In the stage of new
national consciousness which corres¬
ponds to the situation of backward¬
ness, there is, above all, room for that
decorative picturesqueness which
functions as a discovery and recog¬
nition of the reality of a country and
its incorporation into literary themes.
It is the case with the Amazon
region, which attracted Brazilian
novelists and short story writers from
the beginning of Naturalism, in the
1870s and 1880s, at the height of the
picturesque period.
It became the material half a
century later of La Vorágine (The
Vortex) by the Colombian, José Eusta¬
sio Rivera, which is situated between
the picturesque and protest literature
(though it is more patriotic than
social); and it came to be an impor¬
tant element in La Casa Verde (The
Green House) by Mario Vargas Llosa
in the recent period of heightened
technical awareness in which the
picturesque and protest are alike
thrust into the background before
the human impact which is present
immanently In universal works.
I T will not be necessary
to enumerate all the other literary
areas which correspond to the pano¬
rama of backwardness and under¬
development: areas like the Andean
high plateau or the Brazilian sertäo
(backlands); or even the condition
and environment of the Cuban,
Venezuelan and Brazilian Negro, as
in the poems of the Cuban, Nicolás
Guillen, the Brazilian, Jorge de Lima,
in Ecue-Yamba-0 by Alejo Carpentier,
Pobre Negro by the Venezuelan,
Rómulo Gallegos or Jubiabá by the
Brazilian, Jorge Amado; or, if you
wish, of the plainsman from the llano,
pampa or caatinga.
The economic reality of under¬
development preserves the regional
dimension as a living actuality,
although the urban dimension, is
increasing in importance But It is suffi¬
cient to realize that some good writers
and even the best have found material
in regionalism for works which have
universal validity writers such as the
Peruvian, José Maria Arguedas, the
Colombian, Gabriel García Márquez,
the Paraguayan, Augusto Roa Bastos
and the Brazilian, Joäo Guimaräes
Rosa. Only in the countries in which
the culture of the big cities prevails
completely, countries such as the
Argentine, Uruguay and perhaps Chile,
has regional literature become a real
anachronism.
In the period of heightened national
consciousness, characterized by the
idea of backwardness, we had a
picturesque regionalism which in
several countries was believed to be
the true literature. I am speaking of »»^
a genre long outdated or reduced to II
the level of sub-literature. Its most " '
generalized and persistent manifes¬
tations during its Golden Age was,

LITERATURE AND DEVELOPMENT (Continued)
perhaps, the gauchismo of the River
Plate region.
The 1930s and 1940s saw the emer¬
gence of a different form of region¬
alism as reflected in what was referred
to as the "social novel", "Indigenism",
or the "Northeastern novel" according
to the country of origin and which,
while not exclusively regional, was so
to a high degree.
This regionalism is of greater inter¬
est to us, since it preceded awareness
of underdevelopment, but it is right to
note that, long before this, writers
such as the Bolivian, Alcides Arguedas
and the Mexican, Mariano Azuela, had
already attained a more realistic sense
of the living conditions and the human
problems of the underdogs.
Among writers who set out to de¬
mystify American reality and who do
so with analytic vigour, sometimes
attaining a high level of artistic skill,
are the Guatemalan, Miguel Angel As¬
turias, the Ecuadorian, Jorge Icaza, the
Peruvian, Ciro Alegría, the Brazilians,
Jorge Amado and José Lins do Regó
and others.
All of them, at least in part of their
work, write social novels closely relat¬
ed to regionalism which frequently In¬
clude the residue of negative pictur-
esqueness, together with a certain
sketchy humanitarianism.
Despite the fact that many of those
writers use a spontaneous, unconven
tional language, the weight of social
conscience at times acts on their style
as a positive factor and gives rise to
the search for interesting solutions
adapted to the representation of
inequality and injustice.
Without mentioning the consummate
master, Asturias, a discursive novelist
like Icaza also owes his continuing
validity less to his indignant protest or
to the emphatic way he paints the
exploiters than to certain stylistic
devices used to express poverty.
This is the case with his novel, Hua-
sipungo, in which certain uses of the
diminutive and of lamenting speech
rhythms represent a sort of diminu¬
tion of man, his reduction to elemen¬
tal functions which are associated with
linguistic inarticulacy in order to sym¬
bolize privation.
In Vidas Sêcas (Barren Lives), the
Brazilian, Graciliano Ramos, carries to
the extreme his normal verbal sobriety,
devising a language which is reduced
to ellipsis, to monosyllable and to the
minimum of phrases in order to ex¬
press the human frustration of the man
of the backlands whose life is circum¬
scribed to the level for survival.
From this point of view, what we now
have is a flowering of the novel,
characterized by technical refinement
which has transformed the vision of
the regions and human lives so that
what had been a matter of picturesque
details becomes more abstract and
acquires universality.
Laying aside sentimentalism and
rhetoric, drawing on non-realistic ele¬
ments such as surrealism, the absurd,
magic situations, anti-naturalist techni¬
ques such as the stream of conscious¬
ness, simultaneous viewpoints, distor¬
tion, ellipsis, the contemporary novel
still uses what was, previously, the
very substance of nativism, exoticism
and social documentation.
We are thus led to suggest a third
phase which might be called supra-
regionalism. It corresponds to the
painful awareness of underdevelop¬
ment and represents a transcendence
of the type of naturalism based on an
empirical vision of the world.
From this supra-regionalism, there
develops in Brazil, the revolutionary
work of Joäo Guimaräes Rosa which
is solidly based on what might be term¬
ed the universality of the region. The
fact of having transcended the pictur¬
esque and the documentary makes
the presence of the region more alive
in works like that of the Mexican, Juan
Rulfo, whether in the fragmentary,
obsessive reality of £/ llano en llamas
(The Burning Plain) or in the ghostly
reticence of Pedro Páramo.
Antonio Candido
PATHWAYS TO A NEW ART (Continued from page 21)

being In any way realist. His "Homage
to the Race", a huge canvas in the
Fine Arts Museum of Mexico City, is
an example of the way he combines
a dream-like atmosphere with vibrant
colours, peculiar to Mexico.
Totally different and yet equally
removed from the tradition of Mexican
muralism are the geometric designs
of the Guatemalan-born Carlos Mérida
which were inspired by pre-Columbian
art. Younger painters like the
abstract expressionists Vicente Rojo
and Luis Cuevas, whose sombre
drawings have a Goyaesque atmo¬
sphere, tend to concentrate on paint¬
ings, drawings and illustrations and
have not followed the muraiist tradition.
In Brazil and Venezuela, however,
Modernism has been a consciously-
pursued policy. Indeed Brasilia and
the University of Caracas are show¬
pieces of Modernism.
Brasilia, designed by Oscar Nie-
meyer, provides a splendid setting
for the work of sculptors like Alfredo
Ceschiati. Sculpture has enjoyed an
extraordinary development in Brazil,
led by artists such as Sergio Camargo.
In Caracas, the University building
provided the same kind of patronage
to national and international artists as
Brasilia. Here abstractionism has
been the outstanding tendency, notably
in the painting of Soto and in the op
art of Carlos Cruz-Diez.
In Argentina, where abstract painting
has flourished since Emilio Pettoruti's
1924 exhibition, there have been a
number of important tendencies such
as Otra Figuración and Madi. The
latter was formed under the leadership
of the European-born, Kosice (1924),
who makes spatial structures of
perspex, wood and metal. More
recently, there has been an outstanding
exponent of op art, Julio Le Parc.
Outside these big countries, where
there is private patronage, an aston¬
ishing number of painters of inter¬
national standing have emerged in
Chile, Peru and in Colombia, painters
who obviously depend on an inter¬
national market. In Chile, Roberto
Matta has led the attack on "official
art" and created an art of unreality,
using striking, visceral forms. ln"Peru,
this international trend is represented
by Szyszlo and in Colombia by Ale¬
jandro Obregón among others.
But Colombia has also produced
one of the really original artists of
Latin America Fernando Botero
whose "monsters" offer a strange,
satirical comment on society. Botero
first began painting in this style in his
"Homage to Mantegna", in which he
first introduced human figures whose
heads were blown up to grotesque
size. His "Presidential Family" with
bishops, soldiers and children is like a
distorted photograph, the large heads
underlining the vacuity of the faces.
These examples will, perhaps, suffice
to show how difficult it is to generalize.
Latin American art came of age with
the Mexican muraiist movement' but in
recent years, by breaking out of the
nationalist framework, it has command¬
ed international attention. The fact
that many Latin American paintings
now hang in galleries in North Amer¬
ica and Europe indicates that the
plastic arts have left provincialism far
behind.

Cultural news from Unesco
The first number of a new monthly
Unesco Information bulletin for cultural
editors was published in January. The
publication aims to keep journalists
specializing in cultural topics informed
of what Unesco and Its associated
organizations are doing or plan to do
in the cultural field. A subject of current
interest receives special coverage each
month. "Cultural News from Unesco" is
published by Unesco's Press Division, Place
de Fontenoy, Paris 7e.
Moving art
A Unesco travelling exhibition on the
arts of Africa, produced in 20 sets, has
begun visits to 100 countries. Nine
earlier Unesco mobile art exhibitions have
been shown in schools, factories, uni¬
versities and cultural centres in 85 coun¬
tries since 1949. Their themes include
Leonardo da Vinci drawings, Japanese
woodcuts, Chinese painting and Persian
miniatures.
Divine mushroom
One of the key enigmas of cultural
history has been the identity of a plant
called "Soma" in the ancient Aryan reli¬
gion. In a remarkable study, "Soma,
Divine Mushroom of Immortality", R. Gor¬
don Wasson, an American specialist in
the ethno-history of mushrooms, advances
and documents the thesis that "Soma"
was a hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita
muscaria. His book, which throws new
light on the role of mushrooms in religious
ritual, first appeared in a $200 limited
edition in 1968. A new edition of this
highly recommended book has just been
published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,
Inc., New York at $15 (See Bookshelf).
Development research
in southern India
The Madras Institute of Development
Studies now issues a regular monthly
bulletin on development questions and in
particular on development problems in the
State of Tamil Nadu and southern India.
A recent issue (No. 11, Volume I,
December 1971) publishes articles on "A
Science Policy for Tamil Nadu" and "Youth
and the Second Development Decade of
the United Nations", and presents in a
special 160 page section, papers from
the Madras seminar on research for
economic and social development, held
last September.
Subterranean 'sea'
Soviet geologists have discovered huge
subterranean reservoirs of fresh water
beneath the steppes and deserts of
Kazakhstan, whose volume is estimated to
be greater than that of the Caspian Sea.
Malaysian cultural studies
The first international meeting to be
devoted to Malaysian culture and its role
In the evolution of south-east Asian
civilization was held recently under
Unesco's auspices in Kuala Lumpur. The
meeting set out the main lines of a
6-year Unesco cultural studies programme
covering the languages, literature, art,
beliefs and ethical values and institutions
of a complex and little-known culture.
INTERNATIONAL
BOOK YEAR
AROUND THE WORLD
During the first week of April, publishers and booksellers In Thailand will sell
books at half price to mark the country's first Book Week.
EXPOLIBRO, the International School Book Fair, opens this month in Bogota,
Colombia, where a Latin American Regional Centre for Book Development has been
set up with help from Unesco.
During January, letters In the U.K were franked with the slogan "International Book
Year 1972: Books for All".

Letters to the Editor
'THAT MAN TO MAN
WOULD BROTHER BE'
Sir,
The "Unesco Courier" is the only
magazine which is truly honest, arid
basically wholesome in all aspects as a
publication for the many, such as
myself, who are not well informed as
to world events. For many years the
writer of this letter has entirely discard¬
ed the commercial type of magazines in
wide variety, made available to the
general public. Similarly, the daily
press is in most cases biased racially
or politically. Truth seems a most
obscure factor to the reader.
The enlightening articles contained in
"Answers to Racism" (November 1971)
I do sincerely pray, will be made avail¬
able by the press in general to show
the Western World they do not have
prior claims to any divine intelligence.
Now in my 69th year, and looking back
over many years in ocean-going ships,
in peace and war, these years were
most valuable in proving to me, a Scot
by birth, that the white race has com¬
pletely failed to convince the peoples
of Africa or the Orient that they possess
superior qualities.
The Scottish poet, Robert Burns,
more than two hundred years ago,
wrote of his vision of hope for huma¬
nity, "That man to man, the world over,
would brother be." I pray for such a
realization. Like Burns, I scorn avarice
and power domination and racial dis¬
crimination. May his vision, and the
tremendous effort of Unesco be fulfilled.
I ceased school attendance at the
age of thirteen: 1 have no scholastic
abilities whereby I could contribute
intelligent discourse to Unesco. But my
reading of the "Courier" Is ever a great
stimulus to deeper understanding of
humanity. Finally, I pray for the day
when the U.N. is the only supreme
power in controlling and guiding the
ways of man.
Robert Donaldson
Montreal, Canada
PERSIAN VASE
Sir,
In your Issue devoted to Iran (Oct.
1971), under the heading "A Persian
Bestiary" (page 10), you describe a
vase decorated with leopards and wild
goats as coming from Sialk. In fact,
this vase was discovered at the Hisar
site to the southeast of the Caspian
Sea, and dates back to 3500 B.C.
F. Bagherzadeh
Technical Adviser
Ministry of Culture and the Arts
Teheran, Iran
S. O. S. ANGKOR
Sir,
I read with great interest your magni¬
ficent number, "SOS Angkor", (Decem¬
ber 1971). May I thank you most
sincerely for producing this issue with
its moving appeal to the world's con¬
science for help to preserve Angkor
from the destruction which could result
from the war now ravaging our country-
The examples of Carthage and War¬
saw, quoted by Hiroshi Daifuku in his
article "SOS Angkor", should Impel
governments, international organizations
and all men of goodwill to act without
delay to save this part of mankind's
cultural heritage.
Since the beginning of the present
conflict, the Director-General of Unesco
has made unceasing efforts in this
direction through his skill and diplo¬
macy and through aid of various kinds.
I am firmly convinced that efforts to
make the Angkor complex a neutral
zone will be successful. With Angkor
saved from destruction, the Khmer
people will be eternally grateful to
Unesco.

PRIORITY FOR SURVIVAL
Sir,
The practical uses of space explora¬
tion are slowly becoming apparent. The
conquest of space is above all a "con¬
quest of dignity", through the opening-
up of new possibilities for man. The
moon no longer symbolizes inaccessi¬
bility (Expressions such as "You are
asking for the moon", lose their mean¬
ing now that moon fragments are
available here on earth).
But unless man defends this dignity,
he runs the risk of losing it, for the
simple reason that the human race is
threatened with extinction. It would be
far better to concentrate on the costly
business of ensuring man's survival
rather than on the no less costly search
for a widening of possibilities open to
man.
I have long wished to express my
gratitude to Unesco which consistently,
by deed and word (your July 1971
issue, "SOS Environment", for instan¬
ce) affirms that the life of every human
being is the foremost "dignity" of all.
Edith Sandemont
Lille University, France
OPEN WINDOWS
Sir,
By a curious coincidence I received
your November 1971 issue devoted to
the fight against racism, on the same
day that I saw a press release announc¬
ing that Unesco had just expelled the
Republic of China.
That Unesco, whose international
action is limited to the problems of
education, science and culture, could,
for what can only be political reasons,
expel a nation that has served the
United Nations and Unesco faithfully
since their foundation, is beyond my
comprehension.
Furthermore, I understand that the
exclusion measure was taken by Unes¬
co's Executive Board, whereas, as it
was pointed out, under the Constitution
of Unesco, only the General Confer¬
ence has the authority to take such
a step.
I am not politically Involved either
with the China of Formosa or that of
Peking. I have "a window open on the
world", and this enables me to observe,
compare and judge.
It would Indeed be a pity if you
were to "open a window" on certain
parts of the world while closing the
door to others with so much to teach
us.
Georges Terlinden
Brussels, Belgium
Unesco's Executive Board decided
on October 29, 1971, that 'From today
onwards, the Government of the Peo¬
ple's Republic of China is the only
legitimate representative of China at
Unesco", and it "invited the Director-
General to act accordingly.' The vote
was 25 for, two against and five
abstentions. Editor.
YOUTH'S EYE VIEW
OF UNESCO
Congratulations on the series of arti¬
cles about Unesco by the Canadian
student, Wayne McEwing (August-Sep¬
tember 1971). The author's description
of Unesco reflects the sincere and
candid viewpoint of youth, and its
message will be clear to young people
the world over. In honest, straight¬
forward terms, he spells out the anxie¬
ties of youth, eager for all men to
live in harmony with their world, and
the deep concern of youth over inter¬
national problems.
Paulo Meneses Leite
Aracaju, Brazil
WRONG GENERAL
Sir.
I recently came across your special
issue on Youth (April 1969). It Is
excellent; It says many things about
young people that should have been
said a long time ago, although it does
not make the point that all age groups
form a continuum of life that is inter¬
dependent.
However, in the photo caption on
page 11, your writers have fallen into
error in Identifying the statue in
Chicago as that of General U.S. Grant.
It is a statue of John S. Logan, a Civil
War political general who founded the
Grand Army of the Republic. Neither
were the young people shown a "hippie
convention".
