“No doubt we take comfort

and fraternity will one day 
reign among men, without 
compromising their diversity.”

“The efforts of science should 
not only enable mankind to 
surpass itself; they must also help 
those who lag behind to catch 
up”, Claude Lévi-Strauss wrote in 
his first UNESCO Courier article 
published in 1951. He contributed 
to the magazine regularly during 
the 1950s suggesting ideas he 
later developed in the works that 
made him world-famous.
Recommending the unification 
of methodological thinking 
between the exact sciences and 
the human sciences, he underli-
ned in another article that “the 
speculations of the earliest geo-
meters and arithmeticians were 
concerned with man far more than 
w ith the physical wor ld”. 
Pythagoras, for one, was “deeply 
interested in the anthropological 
significance of numbers and figu-
res”, as were the sages of China, 
India, pre-Colonial Africa and 
pre-Colombian America, “preoc-
cupied” with the meaning and 
specific attributes of numbers.
His idea grew into a thesis on 
the “mathematics of man – to be 
discovered along lines that 
neither mathematicians nor 
sociologists have as yet been 
able to determine exactly,” and 
destined to be “very different 
from the mathematics which the 
social sciences once sought to 
use in order to express their 
observations in precise terms,” as 
the father of structural anthropo-
logy explained in a 1954 article 
published in the Social Science 
in thiS iSSue
Jasmina Šopova
Bulletin, another source for this 
issue.
“Our sciences first became iso-
lated in order to become deeper, 
but at a certain depth, they suc-
ceed in joining each other. Thus, 
little by little, in an objective 
area, the old philosophical hypo-
thesis…of the universal existence 
of a human nature is borne out”, 
he said in a 1956 document 
 preserved in the UNESCO archives, 
which opened their doors wide so 
that this special issue could be, if 
not def initive, as var ied as 
possible.
Throughout, the idea of the 
sciences’ crucial role in humani-
ty’s development, and more speci-
f ically the interaction of the 
human and exact sciences, stands 
out as a fundamental concern for 
this remarkable personality, who 
had a close relationship to our 
Organization from the time of its 
foundation after the Second World 
War. You can read about it in the 
article “Claude Lévi-Strauss and 
UNESCO” by the anthropologist 
Wiktor Stoczkowski. 
Already in 1950, the author of 
“Race and History” – a classic 
anti-racism text, commissioned by 
UNESCO – was striving to prove it 
was useless to combat the idea of 
“racial” inequality as long as we 
perpetuated the idea of inequality 
in societies’ cultural contributions 
to humanity’s common heritage. 
Down through the years, and 
all along the pages of the articles 
you will find in this issue, Lévi-
Strauss insisted forcefully that the 
West had forgotten the lessons it 
could learn from the East; that 
when in Europe  …

dated 13 March 1964, in which 
Claude Lévi-Strauss expresses his 
reserve with respect to UNESCO’s 
project to carry out a study on the 
research trends in the social and 
human sciences. Several docu-
ments reflecting the discussions 
the subject inspired at the time 
are also included (on line). In 
addition to the “chapter on anthro-
pology” written a year later by 
Claude Lévi-Strauss, an “additional 
contribution” by the anthropolo-
gist Luc de Heusch, as well as brief 
and incisive comments by Professor 
S.A. Tokarev from the Soviet 
Union, are featured. 
video (on line) to its text 
to enrich the content of 
our special tr ibute to 
Claude Lévi-Strauss, cele-
brating his 100th birthday 
this year. It is also the first 
time most of the included 
articles by the famous 
anthropologist appear in 
Arab ic ,  Chinese  and 
 Russian. This issue gave us 
the additional opportunity 
to revise the Spanish and 
English translations of pre-
viously published texts. We 
would like to thank Cathy 
Nol an and Franc isco 
Vicente-Sandoval who 
revised the articles in the 
two languages. 
Thanks also to Jens Boel 
and Thierry Guednée for the 
selection and digitization 
of the archive documents in 
this issue, like the report 
… the mentally ill were kept 
in chains, so-called primitive peo-
ples were treating them using 
methods akin to psychoanalysis; 
that a ceremonial meal among the 
Kwakiutl was not so different from 
a banquet in a so-called civilized 
country; that all humans speak, 
make tools and follow certain 
rules of behaviour, and this is 
what makes them human, not 
what they use to build houses. All 
these examples nour ish the 
themes advocated by UNESCO 
since its creation.
But Stoczkowski also evokes 
the tension arising in 1971 and 
casting a shadow over the emi-
nent anthropologist’s relationship 
with UNESCO. It was provoked by 
Lévi-Strauss’s speech at the launch 
of the International Year for 
Action to Combat Racism and 
Racial Discrimination. That essay, 
“Race and Culture”, would nonethe-
less have international impact. 
We are releasing the sound 
recording of that speech for the 
first time in 37 years, in this issue 
(in its on line version) of the 
UNESCO Courier. 
On 16 November 2005, Lévi-
Strauss returned to UNESCO to 
celebrate the Organization’s 60th 
anniversary. You will find out 
about this special and moving 
occasion in the different sections 
of this issue, which also includes 
some of Lévi-Strauss’s manuscripts 
and a previously unpublished 
interview he gave UNESCO on 20 
November 2006, a week before his 
98th birthday.
This is the f irst time the 
UNESCO Courier adds sound and 
“Nothing indicates racial 
prejudices are diminishing 
and indications are not 
lacking to suggest that after 
brief local respites, they 
surge up again elsewhere 
with renewed intensity. 
Which is why UNESCO feels 
the need periodically to take 
up again a struggle whose 
outcome is uncertain, to say 
the least.”

The first contribution of Claude 
Lévi-Strauss to the delibera-
tions of UNESCO goes back to 
1949: he participated then in the 
international commission of scho-
lars entrusted with drafting the 
first UNESCO declaration on race, 
published consecutively in 1950. 
In the same year, he was commis-
sioned by UNESCO to carry out an 
inquiry into the state of social 
sciences in Pakistan. In 1951, he 
sat on the committee of experts 
convened to set up the Interna-
tional Social Science Council, of 
which he was the first Secretary-
General, from 1952 to 1961. In 
1952, on the request of UNESCO, 
he wrote Race and History, which 
was to become a classic of antira-
cist literature. In 1971, invited to 
inaugurate the International Year 
for Action to Combat Racism, 
Lévi-Strauss gave a lecture entit-
led Race and Culture. This lecture 
was not in keeping with the doc-
trine of the Organization, and it 
undermined the relationship. 
There has, however, been reconci-
liation in recent years, as was 
Claude lévi-StrauSS 
and uneSCo
One of the architects of the first UNESCO declaration 
on race (1950), author of Race and History (1952) 
and Race and Culture (1971), written at the request 
of UNESCO, Claude Lévi-Strauss participated in 
the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the 
Organization (2005). Half a century of history.

shown by the atten-
dance of Claude Lévi-
Strauss at UNESCO’s 
sixtieth anniversary 
celebrations in 2005. 
These vicissitudes show the 
parallel development, over half a 
century, of the thought of Claude 
Lévi-Strauss on one hand, and of 
the doctrine of UNESCO on the 
other. The main topic with which 
both dealt was the biological and 
cultural diversity of mankind. 
Agreements… 
In his twenties, Claude Lévi-
Strauss was a committed political 
activist belonging to a circle of 
young socialist intellectuals, who 
were profoundly affected by the 
catastrophe of the Great War, 
which they had not participated 
in. They were all virulently paci-
fistic and anti-nationalistic. The 
revolution to which they aspired 
would have to be made without 
violence, by a radical transforma-
tion of the moral conscience, 
which would lay the foundations 
of a new humanism, necessary to 
build an egalitarian, fair and 
peaceful society. They wanted 
relationships between peoples to 
be placed under the responsibility 
of international author it ies, 
which would be able to resolve 
conflicts between States without 
recourse to war. These ideas were 
close to the programme of the 
International Institute of Intel-
lectual Cooperation, which already 
pref igured the pr inciples of 
UNESCO’s future doctrine in the 
1920s and 1930s. It was therefore 
natural for Lévi-Strauss to res-
pond favourably in 1949 to the 
invitation to participate in the 
activities of the Organization, 
whose programme embodied his 
own convictions so well.
After the disaster caused by 
Nazism, one of the priorities was 
to delegitimize  …

6 … the ideology of the ine-
quality of races. UNESCO intended 
to promote the ideas that had 
previously been disputed by 
Nazism: the unity of mankind, the 
arbitrary nature of racial classifi-
cations, the equality of humans, 
the harmless effects of miscege-
nation and the instinct of coope-
ration as an essential property of 
humans. Such was the main mes-
sage of the first UNESCO declara-
tion on race (1950). 
Following this text, several 
brochures for the general public 
were quickly published, conceived 
by UNESCO’s Division for the Study 
of Race as an instrument of an 
“educational of fensive”. The 
contribution of Lévi-Strauss was 
Race and History. Its interest was 
to offer an argument that could 
remedy a major defect of UNESCO’s 
anti-racist doctrine. What good 
was it – as Lévi-Strauss said – to 
establish that no biological data 
confirmed the idea of the inequa-
lity of “races”, if one allowed 
the belief in inequality in its 
cultural dimension to endure, 
by which the conviction that 
societies are not able to make 
equivalent contributions to the 
common heritage of civiliza-
tion remained intact? The solu-
tion proposed by Lévi-Strauss 
consisted in showing that the 
ability to make cultural pro-
gress was not linked to the 
superiority of one society com-
pared to others, but rather to 
the aptitude of everyone to 
establish mutual exchanges 
with others. Thus, by making 
exchanges the fundamental 
condition for progress, Race 
and History was in perfect har-
mony with the ideology of coope-
ration, whose propagation UNESCO 
wished to promote.
… and disagreements
Nineteen years later, when he 
was invited to deliver the inaugu-
ral lecture of the International 
Year for Action to Combat Racism, 
Claude Lévi-Strauss had a much 
more critical view of UNESCO’s 
doctr ine than in 
1952. He confessed 
that he doubted that 
“ the  sp read  of 
knowledge and the 
development of com-
munication among 
human beings will 
some day let them 
live in harmony, 
accepting and res-
pecting their diver-
s it y”. The f ight 
against racism had 
proved ineffective – 
he concluded –, 
because the initial diagnosis, 
which was at the root of the 
Organization’s  programme, was 
erroneous right down to its fun-
damental principles: the racial 
form taken by intolerance was not 
a result of false ideas about race; 
it had a much deeper basis, whose 
ideas were just an ideological dis-
tortion, deployed to conceal the 
conflict that, according to Lévi-
Strauss, resulted from the demo-
graphic saturation of our planet.
The paradox is that Lévi-Strauss 
conceived this vision of the 
 harmful impact of demographic 
growth when he was led to take 
an interest in demographic ques-
tions at the International Social 
Science Council, where he had 
taken the initiative to organize 
several seminars on demography. 
Following the lecture, the disa-
greement with UNESCO’s doctrine 
became manifest. Lévi-Strauss felt 
that UNESCO was going astray by 
wanting to reconcile two opposed 
tendencies: civilising progress 
leads to growth in populations, 
which encourages cultural exchan-
ges, but the latter  …

their exchanges and keep their 
distance from each other. 
If the ideas that were conside-
red scandalous in 1971 could 
receive a warm welcome at UNESCO 
in 2005, it is because the doctrine 
of the Organization had changed 
during the quarter of a century, 
coming closer to the vision of 
which Claude Lévi-Strauss had 
been one of the first defenders. 
The founding project of UNESCO 
planned to deploy educational 
action on a worldwide scale, with 
the intention of achieving social 
progress and constructing a “new 
human unity”, to use an expres-
sion commonly used in the book 
Basic Education, Common Ground 
for all Peoples (1947): in fact, this 
programme consisted in wanting 
to impose the same cultural model 
everywhere, a model principally 
conceived by Westerners. At the 
end of the 1940s, such a unifying 
movement was held to be revolu-
tionary, progressive and redee-
ming. In 2005, the perspective of 
UNESCO had reversed by compari-
son with this initial conception. 
Unification now had … 
Lévi-Strauss, commenting on the 
incident and the reactions that it 
caused in 1983, in the preface to 
The View from Afar, in which the 
text of Race and Culture was inclu-
ded [published in English by Basic 
Books].
Diversity: a precious 
heritage to preserve
And yet, twenty-four years later, 
Claude Lévi-Strauss once more 
climbed onto the dais of the great 
auditorium of the UNESCO Buil-
ding, invited to make a speech on 
the occasion of the sixtieth anni-
versary of the Organization. This 
time, the lecture caused a reac-
tion that was diametrically oppo-
site to the previous one: the 
audience rose to its feet in a long 
and enthusiastic ovation. Parado-
xically, in 2005 Lévi-Strauss said 
more or less the same things as in 
1971. He repeated that the demo-
graphic explosion is a catastrophe 
that is responsible for our ills; 
that it leads to an impoverish-
ment of cultural diversity; that to 
maintain this diversity, it is 
necessary for peoples to limit 
… lead to the obliteration 
of cultural diversity, while at the 
same time demographic satura-
tion causes its inevitable share of 
intolerance and hostility towards 
peoples that have become rivals. 
In this situation, Lévi-Strauss 
came to maintain the right of 
every culture to remain deaf to 
the values of the Other, or even 
to contest them. This amounted 
to replacing the conception – 
defended by UNESCO – of humans 
spontaneously open to the Other 
and brought to cooperate with 
their fellow humans, by a concep-
tion of humans naturally inclined 
to be if not hostile, then at least 
reserved towards the Other. 
Xenophobia – in the very 
moderate form that Lévi-Strauss 
gave to it, that of insensitivity to 
the values of the Other – is here 
transformed from a fact of modi-
fiable culture into a fact of inera-
dicable nature. As a result, for 
Lévi-Strauss the UNESCO project 
became partially ineffectual, as 
one cannot hope to change unal-
terable human nature by action 
taken on its social element, 
through education and the fight 
against prejudice. 
These words shocked the liste-
ners. One can easily imagine how 
disconcerted UNESCO employees 
were, who, meeting Lévi-Strauss 
in the corridor after the lecture, 
expressed their disappointment at 
hearing the institutional articles 
of faith to which they thought 
they had the merit of adhering 
called into question. René Maheu, 
the Director General of UNESCO, 
who had invited Lévi-Strauss to 
give this lecture, seemed upset. 
“It was quite a scandal,” said

lization”, and was seen as a threat

perceived as an obstacle to pro-
gress, but as a  precious heritage 
Declaration on Race (1950)  
«Race» – a social myth
At its twentieth session in 1978, UNESCO’s General Conference adopted, on November 27th, a resolution 
concerning the implementation of the Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice. 
The very first document at the origin of this Declaration is the Statement by experts on race problems (July 
20th 1950). Claude Lévi-Strauss was one of them. 
Excerpts
1. Scientists have reached general agreements in recognizing that mankind is one: that all men belong to the 
same species, Homo sapiens. […] 
4. In short, the term “race” designates a group or population characterized by some concentrations, relative 
as to frequency and distribution, of hereditary particles (genes) or physical characters, which appear, fluc-
tuate, and often disappear in the course of time by reason of geographic and or cultural isolation. […] 
5. These are the scientific facts. Unfortunately, however, when most people use the term “race” they do not 
do so in the sense above defined. To most people, a race is any group of people whom they choose to describe 
as a race. […] 
6. […] Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term “race” is used in popular 
parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term “race” altogether and speak of 
“ethnic groups”. 
7. Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present 
time? […] Most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major 
divisions, as follows: the Mongoloid Division; the Negroid Division; the Caucasoid Division. […] 
9. Whatever classification the anthropologist makes of man, he never includes mental characteristics as part 
of those classifications. […] the tests have shown essential similarity in mental characters among all human 
groups. 
11. So far as temperament is concerned, there is no definite evidence that there exist inborn differences 
between human groups. […] 
13. With respect to race-mixture, the evidence points unequivocally to the fact that this has been going on 
from the earliest times. […] Statements that human hybrids frequently show undesirable traits, both physi-
cally and mentally, physical disharmonies and mental degeneracies, are not supported by the facts. […] 
14. […] For all practical social purposes ”race” is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The 
myth ”race” has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a 
heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. […] 
15. We now have to consider the bearing of these statements on the problem of human equality. It must be 
asserted with the utmost emphasis that equality as an ethical principle in no way depends upon the assertion 
that human beings are in fact equal in endowment. […] Nevertheless, the characteristics in which human 
groups differ from one another are often exaggerated and used as a basis for questioning the validity of 
equality in the ethical sense. […] every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main, because he is 
involved in mankind.
to be preserved. Claude Lévi-
Strauss had been defending this 
point of view for decades. At the 
beginning of the twenty-first 
 century, he could note that 
UNESCO had joined him in this 
conviction. The humanist stance 
of the anthropologist and the mis-
sion of UNESCO have found a new 
 resonance. 

The idea of subjective population density 
In his “Preliminary Memorandum on the programme of the International Social Science Council”, dated 
27 February 1953, Claude Lévi-Strauss tackled the problem of demography. A few excerpts. 
“Demographers have considered population problems from a perspective that is too exclusively objective. 
But population density is not only the result of the number of inhabitants per square kilometre or the ratio 
between needs and resources”, he says. 
Excerpt.
Other factors come into play; thus, the development of means of communication leads to a manifold increase 
in contacts between individuals (when one considers roads and means of transport) and between minds (when 
one widens the problem to means of intellectual communication). Populations react differently, according to 
whether they are aware of their objective density or not, whether they are delighted with it or fear it, whether 
they minimise it or exaggerate its effects. 
In order to evaluate demographic change, it is necessary to include in the variables studied by demography 
other variables, whose study is an element of all social sciences: law, economic science, political science, 
sociology, social anthropology and psychology. 
There is also a specific aspect of the same problem, to which A. Sauvy, President of the United Nations 
Commission on Population, has drawn my attention, and which, demographers agree, requires the contribution 
of social sciences: it is the different way – which is absolutely unpredictable on the basis of purely demographic 
analysis – in which every country reacts to increasing demographic pressure. This reaction may be positive, like 
in Holland, almost nonexistent, like in France, or negative, as has been the case in India. Here, once more, only 
a comparative study of legal systems, political institutions, economic situations, traditional customs and group 
psychology would make forecasting possible.
The expanding dimensions of national groupings
It is a common idea that the current political world consists of national groupings that are no longer of the 
same order of magnitude. Europe still consists of States of a size that could be called traditional when compa-
red to the size of the United States, the Soviet Union, China or India. It is generally admitted that these 
“Super-States” represent a type of normal structure for the modern world, hence the movements for European 
unification. Therefore, we now have not only extreme forms at our disposal for observation, but all sorts of 
intermediate forms. It would be very interesting to study the consequences of the expansion of national grou-
pings. One may a priori formulate the hypothesis that large States could not have the same type of legal, 
political, economic and social structure as small ones, and that communication between their members must 
be made in different ways. Among these differences, what are those that exclusively or predominantly depend 
on the size of groups? Such a problem requires the contribution of demographers (who are currently studying 
the problem of minimum population sizes), anthropologists (who study very small groups), historians (who, 
with the formation of nationalities in the 19th century, know about a process of the same order, even if it ope-
rated on a smaller scale), and, finally, for obvious reasons, lawyers, economists, sociologists and 
psychologists. 
It is not certain that this method would make it possible to determine an optimum size of national grou-
pings, a problem that already preoccupied Auguste Comte. But one might reach conclusions and hypotheses 
that would help statesmen, especially in Europe, by making it possible for them to foresee the consequences 
of their efforts towards federation or unification.

cal and religious princi-
ples forming the basis of 
the new state 
This dual aspect – the 
spiritual home and the national 
reality – character izes the 
Pakistan of today. It explains too, 
certain paradoxes. For although 
Pakistan’s hope is to br ing 
together Moslems from all over 
pre-partition India, in reality 
40 million  Moslems  – or roughly 
30 per cent of the total number – 
are still scattered in other parts 
of the sub-continent. 
As a nation, Pakistan has defi-
ned frontiers and distinctive geo-
graphic and sociological features. 
As a spiritual home, it somewhat 
anticipates its national individua-
lity. For it must mould itself – 
with  undiminished creative zeal 
– in the image of the great pro-
mise it wishes to be, not only for 
its own people but also for all 
those who some day may come 
seeking a means of life in keeping 
with their faith.
The Golden Fibre
One has only to glance at a map 
to understand the complexity of 
the problems confronting this 
nation which has set itself such 
lofty requirements. Not only do a 
thousand miles of Indian Territory 
split East and West Pakistan but 
differences in climate, physiogra-
phy and even language separate 
the two regions. Eastern Pakistan, 
though by far the smaller area, 
has the larger population; yet it is 
West Pakistan, which is less 
 fertile, that compensates for the 
food shortages of the eastern 
zone. This zone (East Bengal) is 
almost entirely devoted to the 
cultivation of jute- the crop which 
enables the government to balance 
its national budget. 
Pakistan happens to hold prac-
tically a world monopoly of raw 
jute yet not only is the country 
unable to convert the fibre for 
lack of any jute-goods industry 
but inadequate port facilities even 
impede its exportation.

government has embarked on a

Of all the countries which make 
up our inhabited globe, 
 Pakistan is perhaps the one which 
presents the most unusual cha-
racteristics. The laws defining its 
existence declared it was founded 
as a state where all Moslems could 
live according to the principles of 
Islam. As such it provides a spiri-
tual home for all members of a 
single religious community regar-
dless of their national origin. 
Nevertheless, Pakistan remains in 
the deepest sense of the word a 
nation. It groups under one uni-
f ied authority lands that for 
thousands of years have been 
inhabited by the same people, 
most of whom have shared for 
centuries the same moral, politi-

There is more to Pakistan’s troubles than merely 
economic problems, asserts Lévi-Strauss in the first

nation founded on an ancient civilization, Pakistan 
synthesizes in its problems the whole of human 
development.

For even the most inten-
sive jute cultivation 
cannot be expected to 
absorb the manpower or 
assure the livelihood of 
p op u l a t i on  wh i c h 
exceeds in densit y 
2,500 inhabitants per 
square mile. In fact for 
centuries the people 
have sought a secon-
dary means of income 
in cottage industries, 
such as the manufacture of muslin 
cloth which has made Dacca 
famous. But even these rural crafts 
are conditioned by unique circums-
tances. They depend on interna-
tional markets not only as a source 
for raw materials but as a sales 
outlet for the finished products. 
To take a specific case, in East 
Bengal, I recently visited a 
number of villages of incre-
dible poverty in the region 
of Langalbund not far from 
Dacca. There, over 50,000 
people live only by the 
manufacture of mother-of-
pearl buttons. These but-
tons of the kind used for 
cheap tee-shir t s and 
 under wear, are produced in 
huge quantities by hand 
tools which might well 
have belonged to the early 
Middle Ages. 
The raw materials needed for 
their production such as chemi-
cals, cardboard and the foil span-
gles used to mount the buttons 
on the cardboard, have ceased 
coming in from abroad since 
Pakistan became independent. …  continue on page 16

must first be given to the adults; 
but surely the problem of re-adap-

is no less important than that of 
other children during and after the 
last world war when psychologists, 
sociologists, psychiatrists and 
educators from all over the world 
joined to find a solution.
Pearl button crisis
Similar problems – and others 
even more specialised – also face 
East Bengal. To solve them will 
require no small degree of 
… the construc-
tion of the first jute 
mills   in Narayanganj, 
a hydro-electric dam 
and a paper mill on 
the Karnafully River, 
additional port facili-
ties at Chittagong, a 
new port at the Ganges 
Delta, power stations 
at Malakand, and sugar 
refineries at Mardan. 
But the immense 
problems of financing 
these projects and of transfor-
ming a large portion of illiterate 
peasants into technically and 
socially educated workmen pre-
sent formidable obstacles. Here

from all parts of

If there is one notion that a 
European seeking to unders-
tand the problem of south Asia 
must banish from his mind, it is 
that of the “exotic”. Contrary to 
what so many suggestions in lite-
rature and travellers’ experiences 
may imply, the civilizations of the 
East are in essence no different 
from those of the West. 
Let us take a look at the bare 
remains that the passage of the 
centuries, sand, floods, saltpetre, 
rot and the Aryan invasion have 
left of the oldest culture of the 
East – the sites in the Indus 
valley, Mohenjodajo, Harappa, 
4,000 to 5,000 years old. What a 
disconcerting experience! Streets 
straight as a bowstring, intersec-
ting each other at right angles; 
workers’ quarters with houses of 
dreary, unvarying design; indus-
trial workshops for the milling of 
flour, the casting and chasing of 
metals, or the “mass production” 
of those cheap goblets whose 
remains still litter the ground; 
municipal granary occupying (to 
use a modern term) several 
“blocks”; public baths, drains and 
sewers; residential quarters provi-
ding comfortable yet graceless 
homes designed more for a whole 
society that lived in comfort than 
for a minority of the well-to-do 
and powerful – all this can hardly 
fail to suggest to the visitor the 
glamour and blemishes of a great 
modern city, even in their most 
advanced form as Western civili-
sation knows it, and as presented 
to Europe today, as a model, by 
the United States of America. 
One would imagine that, over 
four or five thousand years of 
history, the wheel had come full 
circle – that the urban, industrial, 
lower middle-class civilization of 
the towns of the Indus valley was 
not so basically different (except 
of course as regards size) from 
that which was destined, after its 
long European incubation, to 
reach full development only on 
the other side of the Atlantic. 
Thus even in their earliest 
days, the most ancient civilisa-
tions of the Old World were giving 
the New World its lineaments. 
Admittedly, the twilight of an 
ancient history of uniform design 
marked the dawn of other, hetero-
geneous histories. But the diver-
gence was never more than 
occasional. 
From the days of pre-history 
down to those of modern times, 
East and West have constantly 
striven to re-establish that unity 
which diverging lines of develop-
ment have undermined. But even 
when they seemed to diverge the 
systematic nature of their opposi-
tion – the place seen at each 
extreme, geographically and one 
might even say morally, of the 
most ancient and the more recent 
scene, India on one hand, America 
on the other – would supply addi-
tional proof, if such proof were 
necessary of the solidarity of the 
whole.
Amazonia and Asia – 
so similar,  
so different
Between these two extremes, 
Europe occupies an intermediate 
position, a modest position no 
doubt, but one she strives to 
make worthy by criticizing what 
she regards as excesses    …

… in the two extremes: the 
paramount attachment, in Ame-
rica, to things material and the 
exaggerated concentration, in the 
east, of things spiritual. Wealth on 
one hand, poverty onthe other, 
situations with which it is attemp-
ted to deal by two conflicting eco-
nomic theories involving, as an 
article of faith, “spending” in one 
case and “saving” in the other. 
When having spent long years 
in both of the Americas, the writer 
last year received, from a Keeper 
of Bengali manuscripts, his first 
lesson in Asiatic philosophy, he 
might have been enticed into an 
over simplified thesis. The picture 
was this : against the Amazon 
region of America, a poor and tro-
pical but under-populated area 
(the latter factor partly compen-
sating for the former), 
was set South Asia, 
again a poor and tropi-
cal, but this time over-
populated area (the 
second factor aggrava-
ting the first), in the 
same way that, of the 
regions with temperate 
climates, North America, 
with vast resources and 
relatively small popula-
tions, was a counterpart 
of Europe, with compa-
ratively small resources 
but a large population. 
When, however, the 
picture was shifted from 
the economic to the 
moral and psychological 
plane, these contrasts 
became more complex. 
For nothing seemed fur-
ther from the American 
pattern than the style 
Asia adopt as their final conclu-
sion an only slightly rationalized 
form of these traditional solu-
tions. It is because the latter are 
a rather logical result of the diffe-
rence in situation between Europe 
and Asia in face of a series of his-
torical upheavals that are funda-
mentally the same for both, but 
with an impact they endured in 
opposite ways.
The reverse side
When one flies over vast territo-
ries of South Asia, from Karachi 
to Saigon, and once the desert of 
Thar has been crossed, this land 
divided up into the smallest plots 
and cultivated up to the last acre, 
at first sight seems somewhat 
familiar to the European. When it 
is looked at more closely, howe-
ver, a difference emerges. 
These faded, washed out 
shades of pink and green, 
this irregular formation of 
f ields and r ice-paddies 
constantly appear ing in 
 dif ferent designs, these 
boundaries blurred as if in a 
patchwork – the whole 
carpet, so to speak, is the 
same; but because form and 
colour are less clear, less 
well-defined than in the 
landscapes of Europe, one 
has the impression of 
 looking at it “wrong side 
up”. This is, of course, 
merely an image. But it 
reflects rather well the dif-
ferent positions of Europe 
and Asia in regard to their 
common civilization. From 
the material point of view, 
at least one seems to be the 
“reverse side” of the other; … 
of life of this sage, whose pride 
lay in walking barefoot and 
having, as his sole earthly posses-
sions, three cotton tunics which 
he washed and mended himself, 
and who thought he has solved 
the social problem by cooking his 
food on a fire of dead leaves, col-
lected and ground up with his own 
hands. 
This doctrine of systematic 
reduction of needs, this effort to 
minimise contact and exchange 
between people and things, this 
withdrawal into oneself to cease 
encroaching on others and at the 
same time ensure better commu-
nication with  Being, do not grow 
out of a form of thought that 
opposes Western thought. In fact, 
certain Western scholars who have 
studied the problems of Southeast

had arrived in the “land of milk 
and honey”. 
It can never be stated often 
enough that it was Europe, which 
by forcibly incorporating the still 
primitive Asia in a world econo-
mic system that was solely concer-
ned to exploit raw  materials, 
manpower, and the possibility of 
new markets, brought about (invo-
luntarily no doubt, and no less 
through the benefits than through 
the abuses of the pro-
cess) a crisis, which 
today it is its to duty 
to remedy. 
Compar ing itself 
with America, Europe 
acknowledges its own 
less favourable posi-
tion as regards natural 
wealth, population 
pressure, individual 
output and the ave-
rage level of consump-
t ion;  r ight ly  or 
wrongly, on the other 
hand, it takes pride in 
the greater attention it pays to 
spiritual values. It must be admit-
ted, mutatis mutandis, that Asia 
could reason similarly in regard to 
Europe, whose modest prosperity 
represents, for her, the most 
unwarranted luxury. In a sense, 
Europe is Asia’s “America”. And 
this “Asia” with less riches and 
more population, lacking the 
necessary capital and technicians 
for its industrialization, and 
seeing it soil and its livestock 
deteriorating daily while its popu-
lation increases at an unpreceden-
ted rate, is constantly inclined to 
remind Europe of the two conti-
nents’ common origin and of their 
unequal situation  … 
sical and moral corruption resul-
ting from over-concentrated, 
collective existence. Everything 
that, in the West, seems merely 
to be a pathological accident 
attending, for the time being, a 
normal process of growth is, one 
might say, a normal state of 
things in the East, which plays 
the same game but is condemned 
to hold all the worst cards. 
Yet, without going back four 
or five thousand years, this stri-
king misfortune seems to have 
been neither inescapable nor of 
very ancient standing. As recently 
as the 17th and 18th centuries – 
thanks no doubt, very largely, to 
the Mogul emperors, who were 
admirable administrators – the 
population of south Asia was not 
over-numerous, and there was an 
abundance of agricultural and 
manufactured products. European 
travellers who saw bazaars exten-
ding from 15 to 20 miles into the 
country (as, for instance, from 
Agra to Fatipur Sikhri) and sel-
ling goods at what seemed to 
them ridiculously cheap prices, 
were not sure whether or not they 
… one has always been  the 
winner, the other the loser, as if 
in a given enterprise (begun, as 
we have said, jointly) one had 
secured all the advantages and 
the other all the embarrassments. 
In one case (though will it 
always be so?) an expansion of 
population has paved the way for 
agricultural and industrial pro-
gress, so that resources have 
increased more quickly than the 
number of people 
consuming them; in 
the other, the same 
phenomenon has, 
since the beginning 
of the 18th century, 
assumed the form 
of a constant lowe-
ring of the amount 
taken by each indi-
v idua l  f rom a 
common pool that 
has remained more 
or less stationary. 
It is to the 
birth and develop-
ment of urban life that Europe 
has come to attach its highest 
material and spiritual values? But 
the incredibly rapid rate of urban 
development in the East (e.g. in 
Calcutta, where the population 
has increased from 2 to 5 million 
in the space of a few years), has 
merely had the effect of concen-
trating, in the poverty-stricken 
areas, such misery and tragedy as 
have never made their  appearance 
in Europe except as a counterpart 
to advances in other directions. 
For urban life in the East means 
nothing but promiscuity, the 
most elementary lack of hygiene 
and comfort, epidemics, under 
nourishment, insecurity and phy-

All Western civilization has 
tended to separate corporeal from 
spiritual activities as completely 
as possible, or rather to treat 
them as two uncommunicating 
worlds. This is reflected in its phi-
losophical, moral and religious 
ideas, and in the forms taken by 
its techniques and everyday life. 
Only recently, with the develop-
ment of psychiatry, analysis and 
psycho-somatic medicine, has the 
West really begun to grasp the 
inseparability of the two worlds. 
This key, which is new to it and 
which it handles so clumsily, Asia 
has long known how to use – for 
purposes, it is true, which are not 
exactly the same. For the West, 
which for three centuries has 
concentrated mainly on deve-
loping mechanical processes, has 
forgotten (or rather has never 
tried to develop) those processes 
of the body which can produce in 
that instrument – the only natural 
and also the most universal one at 
man’s disposal – effects whose 
diversity and accuracy are gene-
rally unknown. 
… in regard of their exploi-
tation of a common heritage.
Europe must reconcile herself to 
the fact that Asia has the same 
material and moral claims upon 
her that Europe often asserts she 
herself has upon the United 
States. If Europe considers she 
has rights vis-à-vis the New World 
whose civilization comes from 
hers, she should never forget that 
those rights can only be based on 
historical and moral foundations 
which create for her, in return, 
very heavy duties towards a world 
from which she herself 
was born. 
The West, however 
need not fear that, in 
this settling of accounts 
with the East, the latter 
alone will be the recei-
ver. Preoccupied as it 
has been, and for too 
long, with the econo-
mic aspect of the rela-
tions between the two 
worlds, the West has 
possibly overlooked a 
number of lessons it 
can learn from Asia, 
and which it is not too 
late to ask now.
Body and Spirit
Despite the interest evinced by 
scholars and the remarkable work 
accomplished by Orientalists in 
the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries, the mind of the West 
has not, as a whole, been very 
open to the messages of Asiatic 
thought; it seemed difficult to 
comprehend when attempts were 
made to introduce it to groups of 
peoples who lacked the basic 
experience underlying it.

The central mosque in Ipswich (United Kingdom), located 
next to the Catholic Church of St Pancras, was built in 
1970 for the local Bangladeshi community.
This rediscovery of man’s body, 
in which Asia could be a guide to 
humanity, would also be a redis-
covery of his mind, since it would 
(as in Yoga and other similar sys-
tems) bring to light a network of 
actions and symbols, mental 
experiments and physical process 
which unless they were known, 
would probably prevent the psy-
chological and philosophical thou-
ght of the East from being, for the 
West, anything more than a series 
of empty formulae. 
This keen feeling, found in 
Asia, of the interdependence 
of aspects of life which 
elsewhere one tried to isolate 
and close off from each other, 
of the compatibility of values 
sometimes considered to be 
incompatible, is also found in 
the sphere of political and 
social thought. The first illus-
tration of this is in the field 
of religion. From Buddhism to 
Islam, proceeding by way of 
the various forms of Hinduism, 
the religions of South Asia 
have shown that they were 
supreme in the art of living 
together, comprehendingly, 
with other very dif ferent 
forms of belief.

In East Bengal, not far from the 
frontier of Burma, we have seen

phere. From the time of Asoka 
– of whom the Director 
General of UNESCO, in his 
speech to the Indian National 
Commission, said that he 
“attained to the concept of a 
universal committee seeking 
the good of all created 
things”- to that of Gandhi, 
the ideal always sought was 
that of peaceful brotherhood. 
This ideal is particularly evi-
dent in the political and aes-
thetic achievements of the 
Emperor Akbar, whose ruined 
palaces – a combination of 
Persian, Hindu and even 
European styles side by side 
– affirm the will, and the pos-
sibility that dif ferent races, 
beliefs and civilizations should 
live together in harmony. 

small specially manufactured, hand 
operated machines. These would 
simplify the different stages of 
work in the button industry. But 
who better than UNESCO can draw 
the attention of scientists and 
technicians to the fact (which they 
so often tend to overlook) that 
the purposes of science are not 
only to solve scientific problems 
but to find answers to social pro-
blems as well. The efforts of 
science should not only enable 
mankind to surpass itself; they 
must also help those who lag 
behind to catch up.

ancient civilization, Pakistan like 
other nations of Asia or America,

… Following a world slump in 
demand, pearl button production 
in the villages has declined from 
60,000 gross per week to less than 
50,000 per month while the price 
paid to the village craftsman has 
fallen 75 per cent. 
This is only one example of the 
distressing problems facing 
Pakistan today. It would be a mis-
take, however, to view them 
merely as economic problems. No 
doubt the key to the dilemma lies 
first with the technicians. 
For example, the material 
conditions of the Bengali peasant 
could almost be unbelievably 
synthesizes in its problems the 
whole of human development. At 
one and the same time, it suffers 
and lives in our Middle Ages which 
its villages perpetuate; in our 
18th and 19th centuries which its 
first attempts at industrialization 
reproduce; in our 20th century 
whose advantages it is determi-
ned to secure. Perhaps the more 
developed nations, by providing 
Pakistan with some of the means 
to bridge these gaps and over-
come such contradictions, may 
learn in return how man can suc-
ceed in attaining his full indivi-
dual stature without denying any 
part of his heritage and of his 
past. 
… of a single sage supe-
rior to gods and men. These 
irreconcilable yet at the same 
time definitely complemen-
tary forms of human faith 
could co-exist peaceably, to 
such an extent that Moslem 
authorities supervised mar-
kets where the only meat dis-
played was pork (the staple 
food of the Mongol peasants 
in the hinterland of Chitta-
gong), and young Buddhists, 
under the amused eyes of 
their bonzes, helped enthu-
siastically to drag the god-
dess Kali’s chariot to the 
river, on the occasion of the 
Hindu festival. 
It would be easy to set against 
this idyllic picture the burnings 
and massacres that marked the 
separation of Pakistan from India. 
But in the case of these universal 
after-effects of nationalist poison, 
is it not the West that bears the 
primary responsibility? The only 
attempts South Asia made in the 
way of political unification – 
before Europe compelled it to 
think in European terms – develo-
ped in quite a different atmos-
 “Europe must reconcile herself 
to the fact that Asia has the same 
material and moral claims upon her 
that Europe often asserts she herself 
has upon the United States. If Europe 
considers she has rights vis-à-vis the 
New World whose civilization comes 
from hers, she should never forget 
that those rights can only be based 
on historical and moral foundations 
which create for her, in return, very 
heavy duties towards a world from 
which she herself was born.”

There was a time when if you 
spoke about savages everyone 
had a fairly clear idea what you 
were talking about. Etymologi-
cally, the savage was a man of 
the forest, and the term denoted 
those people who lived in close 
contact with nature. The German 
naturvölker (nature folk) conveyed 
this idea directly. 
But apart from the fact that all 
savages do not necessarily live in 
forests (think of the Eskimos), the 
word soon took on a figurative 
meaning which quickly became 
derogatory. Then too, the idea of 
living in close contact with nature 
is ambiguous; farmers live in much 
closer proximity with nature than 
city dwellers yet both belong to 
the same civilization. 
Scientists came to realize that 
you could not classify the people 
of the world according to how 
close or how far removed they 
were from nature. In fact what 
distinguishes mankind from the 
animals is that man, with his uni-
versal use of language, his fabri-
cated implements and tools, and 
his submission to customs, creeds 
and institutions, belongs to a 
higher order than any living thing 
in nature. The world of man is a 
world of culture that is rigorously 
and unequivocally opposed to 
nature whatever the level of civi-
What common 
denominator?
First of all, we can discount the 
factor of numbers, which is the 
size of the society. Of course, size 
does have meaning from the 
global point of view, for societies 
comprising several million mem-
bers appear only rarely in the his-
tory of mankind and are found 
only in a few great civilizations. 
Moreover, these civilizations 
appeared at different historical 
epochs and in regions as far apart 
as the East and Far East, Europe, 
Central and South America. Yet 
below this level there are diffe-
rences so great that the factor of 
numbers or size can have    … 
lization. Every human being talks, 
makes implements and behaves 
according to set rules whether he 
lives in a skyscraper or in a that-
ched hut in the middle of the 
forest. And it is this that makes 
him a human being, not the parti-
cular materials he builds his house 
out of. 
Modern anthropology prefers 
therefore to use the word primi-
tive to designate the people who 
used to be called savage. There 
are an enormous number of primi-
tive societies – several thousands 
according to a recent estimate. 
But trouble starts when an effort 
is made to describe the characte-
ristics of such societies.
“PrimitiveS”?
The term implies the idea of a beginning. It refers to people who live as they did at the dawn 
of human history? A tempting hypothesis, but one that leads to serious misunderstandings, 
says Lévi-Strauss, explaining in this May 1954 Courier article why the notion of primitive 
society is an illusion.

life that goes back to the begin-
nings of human society? This is an 
attractive hypothesis and it is 
valid within certain limits. But it 
is also liable to cause serious 
confusion. 
First, we know absolutely 
nothing about mankind’s actual 
beginnings. The earliest 
traces we have discove-
red – arms and imple-
ments in chipped stone 
some thousands of cen-
turies old – are certainly 
not the very first pro-
ducts of the human brain. 
They already reveal com-
plicated technical skills 
which must have develo-
ped little by little. And 
above all, these techni-
ques are found to be the 
same over vast stretches 
of the earth’s surface 
implying therefore that 
they had time to spread, to 
influence one another, and to 
become homogeneous. 
In the second place, the peo-
ples whom we call primitive are 
all- or nearly all- familiar with at 
least some of the arts and techni-
ques that appeared extremely late 
in the development of the civili-
zation. Although the oldest chip-
ped stone implements may date 
from 400,000 or 500,000 years 
ago, agriculture, stock rising, 
weaving and pottery appeared 
only about ten thousand years 
ago, perhaps less. Thus the “pri-
mitiveness” of peoples who culti-
vate gardens, breed pigs, weave 
loincloths and make cooking-pots 
is quite relative in the time span 
of the total duration of human 
 history. …
western Europeans scarcely chan-
ged from the  beginning of historic 
times until the invention of the 
steam-engine; there was no fun-
damental difference between the 
life of a patrician in Imperial 
Rome and that of a well-to-do 
Frenchman, Englishman or Dutch-
man of the 18th century. 
Moreover, neither Rome in the 
second centur y  B.C .  nor 
Amsterdam about 1750 is compa-
rable with a Melanesian village of 
today or with Timbuktu in the 
middle of the 19th century. 
Civilizations which preceded the 
birth of our industrial civilization 
should not be confused with 
those which existed outside it, 
and would probably have remai-
ned outside for a very long time 
if industrialization had not been 
imposed upon them. 
The fact is that when we speak 
of primitive peoples, we have the 
factor of history (or time) in mind. 
The very word primitive implies 
the idea of a beginning. Then can 
we say that primitive peoples are 
those which have retained or pre-
served to the present day a way of 
… no absolute value. Some 
African kingdoms included several 
hundred thousand members, 
 Oceanian tribes several thousand, 
but in the same regions of the 
world we find societies made up 
of a few hundred persons or even 
at times of only a few dozen. 
In addit ion, such 
peoples (for instance, 
the Eskimos and some 
Australians tribes) are 
often organized in an 
extraordinarily flexible 
way: a group is able to 
expand on festive occa-
sions or during certain 
periods of the year, so 
as to include several 
thousand persons, while 
at other seasons it splits 
up into small self-suffi-
cient bands of a few 
families, or even of 
single families. Obviously 
if a society consisting of 40 mem-
bers and another of 40,000 can 
both be called primitive for the 
same reasons, the numerical 
factor alone doesn’t provide an 
explanation.
Cultures existing 
outside industrial 
civilization
We may perhaps be on firmer 
ground if we consider another fea-
ture, undeniably present in every 
culture we call primitive: each of 
them is, or was at least until very 
recently, outside the range of 
industrial civilization. But here 
again, the yardstick will not work. 
Consider the case of Western 
Europe. It has often be stated, 
and rightly, that the way of life in

their immobilization and 
isolation in the same 
place from the most dis-
tant times, have in fact 
been in contact for thou-
sands of years with all 
k inds of much more 
highly developed popula-
tions. Far from these 
alleged primitives having 
no history, it is their his-
tory that explains the 
very special conditions in 
which they have been 
found. 
For it would be absurd 
to think that, because we 
know nothing or almost 
nothing of their past, 
primitive peoples have 
no history. Their remo-
test ancestors appeared on the 
earth at the same time as our 
own. For tens and even hundreds 
of thousands of years, other socie-
ties preceded theirs and throu-
ghout that time lived, endured 
and therefore changed as ours 
did. They knew wars, migra-
tions, periods of want and 
prosperity. They had great 
men who left their stamp on 
technical knowledge, on art, 
morals and religion. All this 
past exists; only they know 
little about it and we know 
nothing. 
The latent presence and 
pressure of a past that has 
disappeared are enough to 
show the falsity of the word 
primitive, and even of the 
idea of a primitive people. 
But at the same time we 
must take note of a feature 
which all societies have in 
common and which    … 
A change of environment to an 
area which lacks good quality clay 
often explains the disappearance 
of pottery sometimes even from 
human memory. Language often 
proves that peoples, whose low 
level of civilization might suggest 
… But we can ask 
another question: after 
all, do not at least some 
of these peoples conti-
nue to follow a way of 
life much older than 
ours, much more like 
that of man in the ear-
liest ages? At once, 
some examples come to 
mind: the aborigines of 
Australia or of South 
America. They lead a 
nomadic life in semi-
arid regions, live by 
hunting, and by picking 
and gathering from the 
earth what food they 
can. They are ignorant 
of weaving or pottery, 
and until quite recently 
used stone implements. 
The natives of Australia had no 
knowledge even of the bow and 
arrow, while those of Tierra del 
Fuego had only a very rudimentary 
type.
People without 
history?
Nevertheless, the progress 
of ethnological knowledge 
provides the explanation. 
It has shown that is these 
cases and in all the others 
that could be mentioned; 
the apparently primitive 
state is not the result of 
any miraculous preserva-
tion of an ancient mode 
of life, it is the effect of 
regression. The Austra-
lians can only have rea-
ched their continent by 
boat, so they must at 
some time have known the 
art of navigation, and 
since forgotten it.

Therefore I cannot too 
strongly warn that rea-
ders – and even scientists 
themse lve s-  shou ld 
beware of ambiguous 
terms like savage, primi-
tive or archaic. By taking 
the presence or absence 
of some form of writing 
as the sole criterion in 
our study of our socie-
ties, we shall, in the first 
place, be invoking an 
objective quality which 
implies no philosophic or 
moral postulate. And at 
the same time we shall 
be relying on the only feature 
capable of explaining the real dif-
ference that distinguishes certain 
societies from our own. 
The idea of a primitive society 
is a delusion. On the other hand 
the idea of a society with no form 
of writing makes us aware of an 
essential side of mankind’s deve-
lopment; it explains the history 
and enables us to foresee and 
perhaps influence the future of 
these peoples. 
… distinguishes them 
from ours. It is the reason for 
applying to them all the same 
term, however inappropriate 
it may be.
Primitive – a 
misleading term
All these societies –from the 
powerful empire of the Incas, 
which succeeded in organi-
zing several million men into 
a politico-economic system 
of exceptional eff iciency, 
down to the small nomadic 
bands of plant-gatherers in 
Australia– are comparable in at 
least one respect: they knew or 
still know nothing of writing. 
They could preserve nothing of 
their past save what human 
memory was able to retain. This 
remains true, even for the small 
number who have, for lack of wri-
ting, developed some systems of 
mnemonics (such as the Peruvian 
knotted strings or the graphic 
 symbols of Easter Island and of 
certain African tribes). Although 
these societies are not, strictly 
speaking, more “primitive” than 
ours, their past is of a different 
kind. It could not be a past pre-
served in writing and thus availa-
ble at any moment to be used for 
present advantage. 
It was a fluid past which could 
be preserved only in small quan-
tities, and the remainder, as it 
came into existence, was condem-
ned to be forgotten with no hope 
of recovery. 
To borrow a simile from the 
language of navigation, societies 
with some form of writing have a

means of logging their course and 
therefore of keeping on the same 
track for a long period. On the 
other hand, societies without 
some form of writing are reduced 
to following an unsteady course, 
which may in the end (although 
the distance covered in the same 
in both cases) bring them back 
very near to their starting point. 
Or at least it deprived them of the 
means of systematically drawing 
away from it, that is to say, of 
making progress.

outset, to certain novel and 
daring forms of mathematical 
thought. […] 
The criticism to which the 
experimental psychologists of the 
beginning of this century, and the 
traditional economists and demo-
graphers, are open is certainly not 
that they have paid too much 
attention to mathematics, but 
rather that they have not paid 
enough; that they have simply 
borrowed quantitative methods 
which, even in mathematics itself, 
are regarded as traditional and 
largely outmoded, and have not 
realized that a new school of 
mathematics is coming into being 
and is indeed expanding enor-
mously at the present time – a 
school of what might almost be 
called qualitative mathematics, 
paradoxical as the term may seem 
because a rigorous treatment no 
longer necessarily means recourse 
to measurement. This new mathe-
matics (which incidentally simply 
gives backing to, and  …
In the last ten years or so 
these ideas, which were of such 
interest to the ancient world, 
have once more become matters 
of immediate practical concern; 
for it should be noted immediately 
that the developments to which 
this number of the International 
Social Science Bulletin hopes to 
make a modest contribution are 
by no means confined to the 
social sciences. They are also to 
be seen in the so-called sciences 
of man (if a distinction can in fact 
be made between the two groups). 
I would go even further, and say 
that the most sensational develo-
pments were perhaps first seen in 
the  sciences of man – possibly 
because, at first sight, those 
 sciences seem the most remote 
from any idea of exactitude and 
measurement, but also, in all pro-
bability, because the  essentially 
qualitative object of their study 
made it impossible for them to 
‘tag along’ behind traditional 
mathematics, as the social 
 sciences have done for so long, 
and forced them to turn, from the 
When we consider the history 
of science, it looks as if man 
realized, at a very early stage, 
what his programme of research 
was to be and then, once having 
decided on it, took hundreds of 
years to acquire the means of 
 carrying it out. In the earliest 
days of scientific thought, the 
Greek philosophers stated the 
problems of physics in terms of 
the atom, and now, two thousand 
five hundred years later – in a 
way that they probably never 
guessed – we are just beginning 
to fill in the framework which 
they outlined so long ago. The 
same might be said of the appli-
cation of mathematics to the pro-
blems of mankind, for the 
speculations of the earliest geo-
meters and arithmeticians were 
concerned with man far more than 
with the physical world. Pythago-
ras was deeply interested in the 
anthropological significance of 
numbers and figures, and Plato 
was much taken up with similar 
considerations. 
human mathematiCS
Human mathematics will escape the 
despair of “great numbers” – the raft 
to which the social sciences, lost in an 
ocean of figures, have been helplessly 
clinging, says Lévi-Strauss in an article 
published in the Social Science Bulletin in 
1954, which recommends co-ordinating 
methods of thought. Excerpts

… expands on, earlier specu-
lative thought) teaches us that 
the domain of necessity is not 
necessarily the same as that of 
quantity.
Neither addition, 
nor multiplication, 
marriage can be 
expressed  
as equations
This distinction became clear to 
the present writer in circumstan-
ces which it may perhaps be per-
missible to recall in this context. 
When, about 1944, he gradually 
became convinced that the rules 
of marriage and descent were not 
fundamentally different, as rules 
of communication, from those 
prevailing in linguistics, and that 
it should therefore be possible to 
give a rigorous treatment of them, 
the established mathematicians 
whom he first approached treated 
him with scorn. Marriage, they 
told him, could not be assi-
milated either to addition 
or to multiplication (still 
less to subtraction or divi-
sion), and it was therefore 
impossible to express it in 
mathematical terms. 
This went until the day 
when one of the young lea-
ders of the new school, 
having considered the pro-
blem, explained that, in 
order to develop a theory 
of the rules of marriage, 
the mathematician had 
absolutely no need to 
reduce marriage to quanti-
tative terms; in fact, he did 
not even need to know 
what marriage was. All he 
asked was, firstly, that it should 
be possible to reduce the marria-
ges observed in any particular 
society to a finite number of cate-
gories and, secondly, that there 
should be definite relationships 
between the various categories 
(e.g. that there should always be 
the same relationship between 
the “category” of the parents’ 
marriage and “category” of the 
children’s). From then on, all the 
rules of marriage in a given 
society can be expressed as equa-
tions and these equations can be 
treated by tested and reliable 
methods of reasoning, while the 
intrinsic nature of the phenome-
non studied –  marriage – has 
nothing to do with the problem 
and can indeed remain completely 
unknown.
Small numbers,  
big changes
Brief and simple as this example 
is, it is a good illustration of the 
direction now likely to be fol-
lowed in collaboration between 
mathematics and the sciences of 
man. In the past, the great diffi-
culty has arisen from the qualita-
tive nature of our studies. If they 
were to be treated quantitatively, 
it was either necessary to do a 
certain amount of juggling with 
them or to simplify to an exces-
sive degree. Today, however, there 
are many branches of mathema-
tics – set theory, group theory, 
topology, etc. – which are concer-
ned with establishing exact rela-
tionships between classes of 
individuals distinguished from 
one another by discontinuous 
values, and this very disconti-
nuity is one of the essential cha-
racteristics of qualitative sets in 
relation to one another and was 
the feature, in which their alleged 
“incommensurability”, “inexpres-
sibility”, etc., consisted. 
This mathematics of man – to 
be discovered along lines that 
neither mathematicians nor 
sociologists have as yet 
been able to determine 
exactly, and which is, no 
doubt, still to be elabora-
ted to a very large extent 
– will, in any event, be very 
different from the mathe-
matics which the social 
sciences once sought to use 
in order to express their 
observations in precise 
terms.
It is resolutely determi-
ned to break away from the 
hopelessness of the “great 
numbers” – the raft to 
which the social sciences,

each) no doubt carries on a very 
old tradition, for the earliest 
Greek philosophers, the sages of 
China and India, and the thinkers 
of the peoples who lived in Africa 
and America before colonial times

much concerned with the signifi-
cance and peculiar properties of

Think both 
mathematically and 
sociologically
The enormous majority of social 
scientists have, even now, had a 
classical or empirical training.

tical background and, even if they 
have, it is often very elementary 
and very conservative. The new

longer to plot progressive and 
continuous movements in mono-
tonous graphs. The field with 
which it is concerned is not that 
of the infinitesimal variations 
revealed by the analysis of vast 
accumulations of data. The pictu-
res it gives is, rather, that resul-
ting from the study of small 
numbers and of the great changes 
brought about by the transition 
from one number to another. If 
the example is permissible, I 
would say that we are less concer-
ned with the theoretical conse-
quences of a 10 percent increase 
in the population in a country 
having 50 million inhabitants 
than with the changes in struc-
ture occurring when a “two- 
person household” becomes a 
“three-person household”.

considerable effort of adaptation

be done in this direction was 
recently set by Social Science 
Research Council of the United 
States of America, which, during 
the summer of 1953, organized a 
mathematics seminar for social 
scientists at Darmouth College in 
New Hampshire. Six mathemati-
cians gave an eight-weeks course 
for 42 persons on the principles 
of the set theory, the group 
theory and the calculus of 
probabilities. 
It is to be hoped that experi-
ments of this sort will be made 
more often and more generally.

and the revolutionary new offe-
rings of mathematical research 
and culture. 
It would, however, be wrong to 
suppose that the whole problem 
consists simply in reorganizing 
instruction, so as to enable social 
scientists to take advantage of 
the latest advances in mathe-
matical thought. It is not 
simply, nor indeed mainly a 
question of taking over methods 
and results from the mathema-
tics wholesale. The special 
needs of the social sciences, 
and the distinctive features of 
the subject of their study 
necessitate a special effort of 
adaptation and invention on 
the part of mathematicians.
Co-ordination of 
methods of thought
One-way collaboration is not 
enough. On the one hand, 
mathematics will help the 
advance of the social sciences 
but, on the other, the special 
… is felt in all 
countries; but the tea-
chers and administra-
tors, most of whom 
have had a traditional 
training, are intellec-
tually ill-equipped to 
plan and carry out such 
a revision. International 
action by the very few 
specialists throughout 
the world who are now 
able to think both 
mathematically and 
sociologically, in terms 
of the new situation, 
therefore seems parti-
cu l a r ly  de s i r ab l e . 
UNESCO would render 
the social sciences an incalculable 
service if it concentrated on wor-
king out a sort of theoretical 
model course in social science 
(which could subsequently be 
adapted to suit local circumstan-
ces), that would strike a proper 
balance between the traditional 
contribution of those sciences 
requirements of those 
sciences will open up new 
possibilities for mathema-
tics. Viewed in this light, a 
new form of mathematics 
therefore has to be develo-
ped. This cross-fertilization 
has, for the past two years, 
been the main object of the 
Seminar on the Use of 
Mathematics in the Human 
and Social Sciences, organi-
zed at UNESCO House in 
1953 and 1954 under the 
auspices of the Internatio-
nal Social Science Council, 
in which mathematicians, 
physicists and biologists 
(on the natural science 
side) and economists, sociolo-
gist s, histor ians, linguist s, 
anthropologists and psycho-ana-
lysis (on the human and social 
science side) have taken part. It 
is still to early to assess the 
results of this daring experiment; 
but whatever shortcomings it may 
have had – which are only to be 
expected in this period of trial 
and error – all involved in it are 
unanimous in stating that they 
gained much from the seminar. 
For man suffers quite as much, 
in his inner life, from “intellectual 
watertight compartments” as he 
does, in his community life, from 
the distrust and hostility between 
different groups. By working for 
the co-ordination of methods of 
thought, which cannot for ever 
remain entirely unrelated in the 
various spheres of knowledge, we 
are helping in the quest for an 
inner harmony which may be, on a 
different level from that with 
which UNESCO is concerned but 
no less truly, the real condition 
for wisdom and peace. 

The problem raised here 
does not in any way 
imply the recognition that 
social sciences are a field 
of their own, nor that they 
are defined by special cha-
racter ist ics. Do social 
sciences deserve a sepa-
rate place, next to the 
humanities on one hand, 
and to natural sciences on 
the other? Do they offer 
any real originality, other 
than – as has amusingly 
been said – of not being 
more soc ial than the 
others, and much less 
scientific? 
Even in the United 
States, where the tripar-
t ite div ision between 
human sciences, social sciences 
and natural sciences seemed to 
have been solidly established for 
half a century, new categories are 
appearing. Thus, behavioral scien-
ces bring together the three orders 
to the extent that they directly 
interest humans. And yet, the 
best French translation of “beha-
vioral sciences“ is sciences de la 
conduite humaine, that is to say 
that there is a return to the bipar-
tite distinction, which has been 
traditional in Europe since the 
Renaissance: on the one hand, 
natural sciences, which deal with 
the objective world; on the other, 
the humanities, which deal with 
humans and the world in relation 
to them.
These methodological problems 
have an immediate importance for 
our debate: if social sciences must 
be considered as separate scien-
ces, their contribution to the 
humanization of civilization is not 
at all obvious; it needs to be 
demonstrated. If, on the other 
hand, social sciences are not dif-
ferent from the research traditio-
nally carried out in the 
name of human sciences, if, 
therefore, they are within 
the field of the humanities, 
it is self-evident that any 
thinking about humans is 
“humanising” just because 
it is “human”. According to 
one conception or the other, 
their contribution to pro-
gress will also seem diffe-
rent. In the first hypothesis, 
this contribution will be 
conceived using the engi-
neer’s model: study a pro-
b lem,  determine the 
difficulties and devise a 
solution using the appro-
priate techniques: social 
order is considered as an 
objective datum, which only 
needs to be improved. On 
the contrary, in the second case 
the stress is placed on becoming 
aware: just the fact of judging an 
order bad or imperfect humanizes 
it, as the emergence of a criticism 
is already a change. 
What is therefore the common 
characteristic in research that is 
classified under the name of social 
sciences? They are all linked to 
society, and to the improvement 
of the knowledge of society; but 
not for the same reasons. 
Sometimes, they are  …
how the SoCial SCienCeS have humaniSed 
teChniCal CiviliSation
Contrary to what one might believe, the mathematization of social sciences is not at all 
accompanied by dehumanization, as Claude Lévi-Strauss declared in this archive document, 
dated 8 August 1956. Technological civilization is not a separate civilization. Humanization 
is based on all humans and all the sciences.

science. Sometimes, one intends 
to study phenomena common to 
all forms of social life, 
but by reaching them 
at a deeper level: this 
is the ambition shared 
by sociology and social 
psychology. Finally, one 
sometimes wants to 
include in the knowledge 
of humans types of acti-
vities that are very 
remote, in time or in 
space, and this research 
falls within the field of 
history and ethnology. 
Uniqueness, depth, 
remoteness: three forms 
of resistance of social 
facts, that the corres-
ponding disciplines 
attempt to overcome in 
parallel, but using dif-
ferent means. 
The three forms do 
not have the same 
basis; it is a fact that 
several centuries sepa-
rate us from the Middle 
Ages, and several thou-
sand kilometres from 
Melanesian societies; 
on the contrary, it is a 
convention that politi-
cal or economic systems 
are sufficiently isolated 
from the rest to justify separate 
disciplines. It has legitimately 
been possible to claim that this 
arbitrary division of social pheno-
mena leads to dehumanization, 
and in several ways.
Social sciences: 
a gratuitous 
manipulation of 
symbols?
One may first wonder if all social 
phenomena benefit from the same 
degree of reality, and if some of 
them (those that are being cove-
red here) are not an illusion, a 
sort of collective phantasmago-
ria. The problem is then to know 
if certain levels can be isolated, 
or if they do not depend on other 
levels with which they maintain 
dialectical relationships. Finally, 
science always postulates the 
coherence of its object; if the 
social sciences at issue are defi-
ned by reference to a pseudo-
object, do they not merely consist 
in a sort of game, a gratuitous 
manipulation of symbols? We 
would then be in the area of 
mystification, which is quite the 
contrary of humanization. 
And yet, mystification is 
al so a human operat ion. 
Whatever the degree of reality 
that we recognize in legal or 
political systems, and whatever 
the objective function they 
perform in the life of societies, 
these systems are productions 
of the mind. By studying their 
structures and the mechanism 
of their functioning, and by 
establishing their typology, we 
learn at least something, namely 
how the human spirit works to 
give a rational form (be it only 
in appearance) to what has 
none. On the condition that the 
corresponding sciences are 
really sciences (that is to say 
that they are carried out in true 
objectivity), the knowledge 
that they gather is humanising, 
for they allow humans to 
become aware of the real func-
tioning of society.
The case of economic science 
is especially significant, as, in 
its liberal form, it has been 
accused of manipulating abstrac-
tions. But in social sciences, as 
elsewhere, abstraction may be 
understood in two ways. Too 
often, it is used as pretext for an 
arbitrary division  …

losophical hypothesis of the 
unity of the human spirit, or 
more exactly, of the univer-
sal existence of a human 
nature is borne out. No 
matter from which angle it is 
approached, either individual 
or collective, in its expres-
sions that are apparently the 
least controlled, or perceived 
through traditional institu-
tions, we see that the human 
spirit obeys the same laws, 
always and everywhere.
The third wave
Ethnology and history put us 
in the presence of an evolution of 
the same type. It was long belie-
ved that history only aimed at 
exactly recreating the past. In 
fact, history, as well as ethno-
logy, studies societies that are 
different from those in which we 
live. They both seek to widen spe-
cific experience to the dimen-
sions of an experience that is 
general, or more general, which 
thus becomes more accessible to 
humans of another country or of 
another time. 
Like history, ethnology is the-
refore part of the humanist tradi-
tion. But its role is to create, for 
the first time, what might be 
called democratic humanism. After 
the aristocratic humanism of the 
Renaissance, founded only on the 
comparison of Greek and Roman 
societies (because no others were 
known) and the exotic humanism 
of the 19th century, which added 
to them the civilizations of the 
East and Far East (but only through 
written documents and figurative 
monuments), ethnology appears 
as the third wave –  …
symbolism that is in fact the same 
one as that that used by social 
psychologists and linguists, to 
the extent that language and 
social stereotypes are also based 
on subconscious activities of the 
mind. 
It is worth focusing on this 
convergence of social sciences for 
a moment. Our sciences f irst 
became isolated in order to 
become deeper, but at a certain 
depth, they succeed in joining 
each other. Thus, little by little, 
in an objective area, the old phi-
… of concrete rea-
lity. Economic science 
has been a victim of 
this error in the past. 
On the other hand, the 
recent at tempts to 
apply modern mathema-
tics (called “qualita-
t ive”) to economic 
theory, have led to a 
remarkable result: the 
more the theory became 
mathematic and there-
fore – seemingly – abs-
tract, the more it 
implied historical and 
concrete objects at the 
outset, as the substance 
of its formalism. No form of eco-
nomic bourgeois thought is closer 
to Marxist conceptions than the 
highly mathematic treatment pre-
sented by von Neumann and 
Morgenstern in 1944 in the Theory 
of Games and Economic Behaviour: 
for them, the theory is applied to 
a society divided into rival groups 
and between which antagonisms 
or coalitions are created. Contrary 
to what one might believe, the 
mathematization of social scien-
ces is not at all accompanied by 
dehumanization. It corresponds to 
the fact that inside each disci-
pline, theory tends to become 
more and more general. In mathe-
matical expression, economic 
science, sociology and psychology 
discover a common language. And 
it may be very rapidly seen that 
this common language is possible, 
because the objects to which it is 
applied are, in reality, identical. 
The same “humanist” connec-
tion occurs in psychology and 
sociology. Thus, by studying the 
mechanisms of subconscious life, 
psychoanalysts make use of a

With the risk of belying the title 
of this lecture, it is therefore not 
by declaring themselves social and 
isolating themselves from the rest 
that our  disciplines will be able to 
humanize civilization, but by quite 
simply attempting to become more 
scientific. Technological civiliza-
tion is not a separate civilization, 
which requires the invention of 
… no doubt the last – 
because, of all social sciences, 
it is the most characteristic of 
the finite world that our planet 
has become in the 20th cen-
tury. Ethnology appeals to all 
human societies, in order to 
draw up a global knowledge of 
humans; and, even better, the 
distinctive characteristics of 
these “residual” societies have 
led it to create new types of 
knowledge, which, as we are 
gradually realizing, can profita-
bly be applied to the study of 
all civilizations, including ours. 
It operates simultaneously on the 
surface and in depth.
Technological 
civilization is not a 
separate civilization
In the absence of written 
texts and figurative monu-
ment s,  these ways of 
knowledge are both more 
external and more internal 
(one might also say coarser 
and finer) than those of the 
other social sciences: on the 
one hand, study from the 
outside (physical anthropo-
logy, prehistory, technology), 
on the other hand, study 
from the inside (identifica-
tion of ethnology with the 
group whose existence it 
shares). Always below and 
beyond social sciences, eth-
nology can neither be disso-
ciated from natural sciences 
nor from human sciences. Its 
originality consists in the 
union of the methods of 
both, at the service of a generali-
zed knowledge of humans, that is 
to say anthropology.

on all sciences. 
Humanizing technological civili-
zation is, first, to

tive in the global 
history of huma-
nity, and then to 
analyse and unders-
tand the driving 
forces of its advent 
and functioning.

result: to know.

The custom of making New Year 
gifts has both a simple and 
complicated history. It is simple 
enough if we merely think of the 
general meaning of the custom 
itself, and examine the example, 
Japan’s New Year wish, “O-ni wa 
soto fuku wa uchi!” (Out, all 
demons! Let good luck come in!) 
Just as the old year should take 
the ill luck away with it, so the 
enrichment and happiness brou-
ght by the exchange of gifts on 
New Year’s Day are regarded as an 
omen, almost as a magic 
spell, to ensure that the 
New Year will continue 
as joyfully as it begun. 
From this point of 
v iew, the Japanese 
saying is very like those 
used by Ovid in the first 
book of the Fastes, des-
cribing Romans customs 
at the festival of Janus. 
Today, this has become 
our January 1, although 
for a long time, even in 
Rome, the festival did 
not coincide with the 
beginning of New Year. 
“What is the meaning”, 
kept up in the French language, in 
which the word for the New Year 
gifts is étrennes. Shopkeepers 
reverse the meaning in the use of 
the verb étrenner, which signifies 
to make the first sale of the day. 
It is more difficult to trace the 
origin of the custom of New Year 
gifts in the Western world. The 
ancient Celtics Druids had a cere-
mony which corresponds to 
January 1. They cut mistletoe, 
which was considered to be a 
magical plant with 
protec t ive powers 
from the oak trees, 
and distributed it to 
the people. Hence the 
name given in certain 
parts of France, until 
quite recently, to New 
Year gifts: guy- l’an- 
neuf, corrupted some-
times into aguignette 
(from the French gui: 
“mistletoe” and l’an-
neuf: “New Year”). 
In Rome during the 
second half of Decem-
ber and the early part 
of January, festivals 
took place   …
the poet asks Janus, “of the dates, 
the wrinkled figs and the light-
coloured honey, offered in a white 
vessel?” “It is an omen,” replies 
the god. “They express the desire 
that coming events may impre-
gnate with the same sweetness…” 
Ovid also relates that on the first 
day of the year, the Roman shop-
keepers were careful to open their 
shops for a short while, in order to 
make a few sales as a good omen 
for the rest of the year. Curiously 
enough, this tradition has been

and furs from her noblemen and 
such presents as precious caskets, 
pots of ginger, orange-flower and 
other confections from her doc-
tors and her apothecaries. 
D u r i n g  t h e  E u r op e an 
Renaissance, metal pins became a 
favourite form of present as they 
were then a great novelty; until the 
15th century, women had used 
wooden pins to fasten their clo-
thing. As for New Year cards with 
pictures and ornamental texts, they 
are known to have been in use from 
Europe to Japan. “Some in golden 
letters write their love” says a 17th 
century English poet. In France, 
illustrated New Year cards were in 
fashion until the revolution.
Spontaneous 
acceptance of 
interdependence
To understand why the practice of 
exchanging New Year gifts is so 
persistent and so widespread, we 
must look beyond these entertai-
ning details for the underlying 
significance of the custom. “The 
manner of giving is more impor-
tant than the gift”, the saying 
goes, and all peoples, “savage” or 
civilized, appear to believe that it 
is better to receive objects as 
presents than to acquire them 
oneself, as if the act of giving – 
or receiving – has added to the 
value of the object. The Maoris of 
New Zealand believed that a 
magic power, which they called 
“hau”, entered into the present 
and created a permanent link 
between the giver and the recei-
ver. Similarly, the Roman custom 
of offe ring …  continue on page 38
beneficiaries, being gratif ied 
with juniper fumes and sprinkled 
with urine. 
New Year gifts, as we know them 
today, are not so much a relic of 
these popular customs as the 
democratization of an aristocra-
tic tradition. Very early in modern 
history sovereigns demanded New 
Year gifts as a means of augmen-
ting their income and affording a 
further opportunity for their sub-
jects to prove their loyalty. In 
France, Henry III and the Duc de 
Berri were in the habit of recei-
ving New Year gifts (what we 
would nowadays call a “luxury 
edition” is mentioned under this 
heading in the inventory of the 
latter’s possessions). It is well 
known that Elizabeth I of England 
relied on her New Year gifts for 
her pocket money and the upkeep 
of her wardrobe; the archbishops 
and bishops each used to give her 
from ten to forty pounds, while 
she received dresses, skirts, silk 
stockings, garters, cloaks, mantle 
… at which gifts 
were exchanged; those 
of fered in December 
were usually of two 
k inds –wax candles 
(which we have adopted 
for our Christmas trees) 
and dolls made of clay 
or some edible subs-
tance, which were given 
to the children. There 
were others, too, des-
cribed in great detail by 
Martial in his epigrams; 
Roman chroniclers rela-
ted that the patricians 
received gifts from their 
plebeian dependents 
and the Emperors from 
the citizens. Caligula 
took possession of his 
gifts in person and spent the 
whole day in the vestibule of his 
palace for this purpose.

Traces of their dual origin – in 
pagan customs and Roman rites- 
seem long to have been preserved 
by New Year gifts. Why otherwise 
would the Church throughout the 
Middle- Ages have tried – in vain 
– to abolish them as barbaric sur-
vival? However, by then, these 
gifts were not only periodical tri-
bute paid by the peasants to their 
overlord, in the form of capons, 
fresh cheeses and preserved 
fruits; or symbolic  offerings, such 
as oranges or lemons, spiked with 
cloves, hung like charms above 
jars of wine to prevent it from 
turning sour, or nutmegs wrapped 
up in gilt paper. They were part of 
a much larger scheme of offerings

Europe, even the livestock were

Most of us regard 
psychoanalysis as 
a revolutionary disco-
very of 20th century 
civilization and place 
it on the same footing 
as genetics or the 
theory of  relativity. 
Others, probably more 
consc ious of  the 
abuses of psychoana-
lysis than of the real 
lesson it has to teach 
us, still look upon it 
as one of the absurdities of 
modern man. In both cases, we 
overlook the fact that, psychoa-
nalysis has simply rediscovered 
and expressed in new terms an 
approach to mental illness which 
probably dates back to the ear-
liest days of mankind and which 
the so-called primitive peoples 
have always used, often with a 
skill that amazes our foremost 
practitioners. 
A few years ago, Swedish eth-
nologists recorded and published 
a long healing ritual used among 
the Cuna Indians of Panama in 
cases of difficult childbirth. In 
the ritual, the tribe’s witch-doc-
tor or shaman stands before the 
suffering mother and begins a 
chant-recitation, explaining that 
her ailment is due to the tempo-
rary absence of the soul which 
controls procreation. The Cuna 
witCh-doCtorS and PSyChoanalySiS
While in Europe the mentally ill were shackled, some primitive societies treated them 
using methods much resembling psychoanalysis, explains Lévi-Strauss in the July-August 
1956 Courier article, where he draws parallels between shamanistic rituals and modern 
psychotherapies.
Claude Lévi-Strauss
Indians believe in the existence 
of a multitude of souls, each of 
which has charge of some parti-
cular functions in life. In this 
particular case, the soul has been 
kidnapped and has been carried 
away to the other world by some 
evil spirits. 
The witch-doctor tells 
the expectant mother 
that he is setting out on 
a supernatural quest for 
the lost spirit. With a rare 
luxury of detail he descri-
bes the obstacles he 
meets and the enemies he 
has to face, how he over-
comes them by force or 
guile before reaching the 
prison of the captive soul. 
Then he releases the soul 
and induces it to resume 
control of the suffering 
body lying at its side.
Witch-doctor 
cures, precursors 
of psychoanalysis
This cure (we have no reason 
to suppose it is not success-
ful at least in certain cases) 
is interesting for a number 
of reasons. Firstly, it is 
purely psychological; no 
drugs are used nor is the 
body of the patient touched. 
The witch doctor simply 
recites or chants, relying on 
speech alone to effect his cure. 
Secondly, two people must parti-
cipate in the treatment – doctor 
and patient – although, as we 
shall see in a moment, this does 
not mean that other members of 
the community may not be pre-
sent.  …
In January-February 1936, Kejara 
included a «Men’s house» and 
twenty-seven houses, most of 
them inhabited by several families. 
[…] Only one of the natives, who 
had escaped the missions, spoke 
Portuguese fluently. Apparently 
there had been a time when he 
had been able to read and write 
the language. Five or six others 
understood it but only possessed a 
vocabulary of a few words.

Claude Lévi-Strauss among the Bororo, in Brazil (1935-1939).

… Of the two persons, the 
witch-doctor, whose powers are 
recognized by the whole tribe, 
embodies social authority and 
order, while the other – the 
patient – suffers from what we 
should call a physiological disor-
der, but which the Indians attri-
bute to an advantage gained by 
the spirit world over the human 
world. Since these two worlds 
should normally be allied, and 
since the spirit world is of the 
same nature as the souls pos-
sessed by the individual, the pro-
blem as the Indians see 
it, really stems from a 
sociological disturbance 
caused by the ambition, 
ill-will or resentment of 
the spirits that is by 
both psychological and 
social factors. 
In descr ibing the 
causes of the ailment 
and recount ing his 
adventures in the other 
world, the witch-doctor 
conjures up for his lis-
teners familiar pictures 
drawn from the beliefs 
and myths which are the common 
heritage of the whole community. 
Since the cures are conducted in 
public, the adolescents of the 
tribe witness them and thus gain 
a detailed knowledge of the tri-
be’s beliefs. 
Several of the characteristics 
described are strangely reminis-
cent of psychoanalytical treat-
ment. Here too, il lness is 
considered of psychological origin 
and the treatment applied is 
exclusively psychological. Because 
of symptoms which he is unable 
to control, or more simply because 
he is suffering from mental stress, 
the patient feels cut off from the 
community and calls in the doctor 
whose authority is recognized by 
the group, to help him regain his 
place in society. The treatment 
seeks to induce the patient to 
describe events buried in his sub-
conscious mind but which, despite 
the passage of time, still govern 
his feelings and attitude to life. 
Now there are events or stories 
that have their origin in so dis-
tant a past that the very recollec-
tion of them has been lost, yet, 
better than more recent events, 
they permit us to understand the 
nature of thing occurring today. 
These stories are what sociolo-
gists call “myths”, and it would be 
difficult to give a better defini-
tion to the word.
Converging and 
diverging aspects
The main difference between the 
medicine man’s treatment (as in 
the example of the pregnant 
mother above) and treatment by 
psychoanalysts is that in the first 
case it is the doctor who does the 
talking while in the second it is 
the patient. A good psychoana-
lyst we know says hardly a word 
during most of the treatment; his 
role is to offer the patient a sti-
mulus (one might almost say pro-
vocation) which the presence of 
another person provides, so that 
the patient can vent all his pent-
up aggressive emotions on this 
anonymous “other person”. 
In both cases the creation of a 
myth is part of the treatment. The 
difference is that with 
the Cuna the myth is 
ready-made, familiar to 
everyone and perpetua-
ted by tradition, the 
witch-doctor merely 
adapting it to each 
individual case. 
In the childbir th 
case, for example, the 
witch-doctor translates 
the myth into terms 
that are meaningful to 
the mother. This per-
mits her to name, then 
understand and perhaps 
thereby dominate the anxieties 
which until then she had been 
totally incapable of expressing in 
any form. 
In psychoanalysis, however, 
the patient elaborates his own 
myth. When we stop to think 
about it the difference is not so 
great since psychoanalysis reduces 
the cause of psychological disor-
ders to a very small number of 
possible situations from which the 
patient can choose, but do little 
more. All of them deal with the 
patient’s earliest experiences in 
life and his relationship  …

As Dr Stewart 
observes in this 
connexion, this 
takes us beyond 
psychoanalysis to 
one of its most 
recent develop-
ment s, namely, 
group psychothe-
rapy. One of its 
most familiar forms 
is the psychodrama 
in which several 
members of the 
group impersonate 
the characters in 
the patient’s myth in order to 
assist him to see more clearly and 
thus bring the tragedy to an end. 
This is possible only if the 
patient’s myth itself is social in 
character. Other individuals can 
play a part in it because it is their 
own myth too, or to put it ano-
ther way, because the critical 
situation in which individuals are 
liable to find themselves in our 
society are broadly speaking, the 
same for all.  …
… with his 
family as a child. 
Here too, a state of 
release is reached 
when the anxieties 
which the patient 
could not express or 
dared not admit are 
at least translated 
into terms of a myth 
f its his particular 
story. 
To reassure psy-
choanalysts and their 
followers, let me 
make it clear at once that, in 
using the word “myth”, I am in no 
way implying that the story in 
question is either untrue or inven-
ted. Many myths are based on real 
occurrences but as I already have 
indicated, what makes a myth 
depends not so much on how 
accurately it reflects the original 
story or event but its capacity to 
give meaning to the present. 
Thus it is not surprising to dis-
cover that skilled psychoanalysts 
who have visited primitive socie-
ties to carry out enquiries with the 
most up-to-date methods of inves-
tigation, have found themselves to 
be on a footing of equality with 
the medicine man, and in some 
cases have even  acknowledged the 
latter’s superiority.
This was the experience of Dr 
Kilton Stewart, an American psy-
chologist who has given us a 
 delightful account of it in his 
book, Pygmies and Dream Giants 
[New York, 1954]. He had set off 
for the interior of the Philippines 
to study the mental make-up of 
the extremely primitive pygmy 
tr ibes called Negr itos. His 
methods closely resembled those 
of psychoanalysts. The witch-doc-
tors not only allowed him to do as 
he wished, but immediately accep-
ted him as one of them; in fact, 
regarding themselves as specia-
lists with a thorough knowledge 
of the techniques employed, they 
insisted on helping him in his stu-
dies. Dr Stewart considers that in 
certain respects their psychothe-
rapy is even ahead of ours. 
I have already mentioned that 
the treatment administered by the 
shaman is given in public. Thus, 
all the members of the community 
gradually acquire the beliefs that 
any disorders from which they 
themselves may eventually suffer 
can be treated by the same 
methods they have so often seen 
used. Furthermore, since they 
know all the stages of the treat-
ment in advance, they are all 
ready and willing to take part in it 
punctuating it with words of 
encouragement, helping the 
patient to marshal his memories, 
and displaying an infectious 
enthusiasm as the patient reco-

advantage, a social superiority 
comparable with that which we 
see in the creative spirit. 
This connexion between an 
abnormal psychological balance 
and creative art is not of course 
unknown in our own theories. We 
have treated many geniuses, such 
as Gerard de Nerval, van Gogh and 
others, as psychotics. At best, we 
are sometimes prepared to pardon 
certain follies because they are 
committed by great artist. But 
even the poor Negritos in the jun-
gles of Bataan are far ahead of us 
in this respect, for they have reali-
zed that one means of remedying a 
mental disorder, harmful both to 
the individual suffering from it and 
to the community which needs the 
healthy co-operation of all, is to 
transform it into a work of art. This 
is a method seldom used among 
us, though it is to it that we owe 
the work of such artist as Utrillo. 
We have much to learn, there-
fore, from primitive psychiatry. 
Still in advance of our own psy-
… We thus see how 
deceptive to think that the 
forgotten events which psy-
choanalysts helps the patient 
to bring back to mind, are 
something private and perso-
nal. Even that dif ference 
between psychoanalysis and 
shamanistic treatments, thus 
disappears. 
“As in Paris and in Vienna”, 
wr ites Dr Stewar t, “the 
Negrito therapists were hel-
ping the patient to contact 
patterns and incidents from a 
long-forgotten past, painful 
incidents buried deep in the 
early time-layers of the accu-
mulated experience which made 
up the personality.”
Turn mental disorder  
into creative talent
In one respect, at least, the pri-
mitive system seems to be more 
daring and more efficacious than 
our own. Dr Stewart describes an 
experience he might have had 
anywhere in the world, among any 
of the peoples we like to call pri-
mitive. When he was about to 
rouse a patient from the waking 
dream in which he was giving a 
haphazard account of incidents in 
his past life – conflict with his 
father transposed into myth-form 
of a visit to the country of the 
dead – his Negrito colleagues 
stopped him. To be definitely 
cured, they said, the spirit of the 
sickness must bestow a gift on its 
victim in the form of a new drum 
beat, a dance or a song. According 
to tribal theory, it is not enough 
to remove the social inferiority 
attributable to the illness: it must 
be transformed into a positive

attained only gradually. 
Even now certain very pri-
mitive tribes, like the Nam-
bikwara of Central Brazil, 
just thrust the food they 
kill or gather (small ani-
mals and wild root-vegeta-
bles) indiscriminately into 
hot embers. The ashes that 
stick to it provide the 
necessary mineral salts. 
This primitive cooking is 
fatal to the sense of taste, 
for the palates of the Nam-
bikwara cannot cope with 
any strong stimulus; they 
have a horror of salt, and 
even of hot food; when I 
offered them a boiled – 
and boiling hot- dish, they 
drenched it with cold water 
before eating it. True this 
archaic attitude is excep-
t ional. Many peoples, 
however, suffer not from 
want of cooking ability but 
from a far more serious lack- that 
of the means of production- as a 
result of which they can hardly 
rely upon more than one type of 
food at a time.
Eating one’s fill
Ethnologists such as E.E. Evans-
Pritchard and  …
is to use the food as its own 
container, by stuffing the animal’s 
body, or flour-paste, with a mix-
ture which cooks while this outer 
cover grills or roasts.
Hot food? Horrors!
All these methods represent dis-
coveries to which the human race 
If, as has been said, the 
art of cooking is to 
combine flavours of diffe-
rent foodstuffs so as to 
blend or to bring out their 
contrasts, the process 
sounds simple enough to 
have been discovered by 
any one of the world’s peo-
ples. Yet this is not the 
case. It is not possible to 
combine different ingre-
dients unless they are 
easily and simultaneously 
to hand, nor can their fla-
vours be mingled and har-
mon i z e d  w i t hou t  a 
knowledge of cooking – 
one that goes further than 
the mere heating of food. 
Even the method of boi-
ling food in an earthenware 
pot is not universally 
employed. Some peoples, 
who have no pottery, bring 
food to the boil by putting it into 
a vessel made of wood or bark 
filled with water and then drop-
ping in heated stones. To other 
peoples, boiling is not known at 
all; they dig ovens in the ground 
and line them with hot stones, the 
food roasting slowly between 
layers of green leaves which give 
off moisture. Yet another method 
theSe CookS did not SPoil the broth
Did you know that for certain peoples, eating 
is an indecent act? They take their food in 
solitary confinement. In this April 1957 
Courier article, Lévi-Strauss ponders not only 
the social aspects of food, but also the human 
adventure of seeking out flavours.

history of cooking is the story of 
a search for means of making 
bread tasty, of creating and foste-
ring the appetite for a basic 
foodstuff – bread, rice, millet, 
maize or manioc, according to the 
region- which supplies energy but 
has little flavour. Meat came later; 
for a long time it was, and in 
many parts of the world it still is, 
a luxury reserved for the privi-
leged. The real foundation of 
 cooking throughout the 
world is carbohydrates enli-
vened by a condiment. 
Bread and onions, chapattis 
ad chutney, rice and sauce 
made from fermented fish; 
millet, maize or manioc 
with pimentos – all these 
are simply variations on a 
universal theme, on which 
the art of cooking has built 
up countless melodies.
Spices changed 
the world
The difficulties attending 
this quest of flavours are 
illustrated by the great sea 
voyages of the 16th cen-
tury, undertaken with what 
today seem the most trivial 
motives. Only some 400 
years ago, Europe was orga-
nizing those tremendous 
expedit ions chief ly for the 
purpose of obtaining spices. 
This marks the birth of cooking 
in Europe and, perhaps everywhere 
else as well, since no culinary 
style seems able to do without 
certain products of American 
origin, unknown elsewhere in the 
world before the discovery of the 
New World – potatoes, tomatoes, 
peanuts, chocolate,  …
origin; the inner glow produced by 
alcohol is for them a sign of anger, 
whereas they connect fasting with 
the highest spiritual emotions. “I 
feel like a young girl again, I’m so 
light hearted!” exclaimed one old 
African woman, on a day when she 
chanced to have eaten her fill. 
In the history of the human 
race there is a memorable, yet 
unknown day: the date when man 
discovered how to keep two diffe-
rent sources of nourishment at his 
disposal all the year round and, by 
combining them, overcame the 
two great dangers to his nourish-
ment- the scarcity of food and its 
insipidity. 
For to eat one’s fill is not 
enough. As a French proverb has 
shrewdly put it, one must not lose 
“the taste for bread”. The whole 
… Audrey Richards have des-
cribed how, in certain parts of 
Africa, the physical health and 
mental outlook of the native 
population are affected by the 
periodicity of foodstuffs. Many 
communities have enough to eat 
during only part of the year, when 
manioc, millet or rice is available. 
After these “fat months” come 
the “lean months”, when the 
people have only what they can 
collect at random. The 
daily meal shrinks in 
size and, still more 
important, a diet rich 
in carbohydrates is 
suddenly replaced by 
one consisting almost 
entirely of such vege-
tables as marrows and 
melons. 
We, with our well-
assured food-supply, 
can hardly imagine the 
intensity of the sensa-
tions resulting from 
this substitution. The 
feeling of repletion 
abruptly gives way to 
hunger-cramps. Violent 
diarrhoea succeeds the 
contrary discomfort of 
flatulence and intesti-
nal fermentation. 
The native population thus 
finds that both their bodies and 
their spirits are radically affected 
by changes in diet. As Audrey 
Richards has said with so much 
insight, it is not surprising that 
such communities regard food as 
perilous stuff, charged with every 
sort of magic influence. They the-
refore associate the sensations 
engendered by food with feelings 
to which we attribute a different

t he i r  mea l s  in  “so l i t a r y 
 confinement”, so as to conceal 
the “indecent” act of eating. Wri-
ting on the Kwakiutl, Boas descri-
bes the etiquette  …
A feast consists of 14 courses- 
rolls and wafers of maize in six 
different colours, various kinds of 
meat, offal, mutton sausages and 
blood pudding. All these are eaten 
with a meat- brush, a small, stiff-
bristled affair which is alternately 
thrust into the dish and sucked 
clean.
Shamed fish do not 
return
The consumption of food is a dis-
tinctly social affair. There are 
very few peoples who, like the 
Paressi of Central Brazil, take 
… vanilla and pimentos. 
A whole chapter of ethnology 
in fact, remains to be written. 
It would describe the character 
and geographical distribution 
of the rules – some very simple, 
others incredibly complex- for 
obtaining, treating, associa-
ting and mingling the various 
basic foodstuffs. It would 
reveal the Polynesians as the 
inventors of the soil-less agri-
culture, for some of these 
islanders succeeded in cultiva-
ting gardens on their coral 
reefs, in trenches filled with 
putrefied refuse: it would show 
that certain tribes, though 
extremely primitive in other 
respects, have performed the 
extraordinary feat of producing 
basic foodstuffs from poiso-
nous plants such as manioc and 
acorns. 
It would also show that cer-
tain primitive peoples have 
developed cooking that is full 
of subtleties. In one of his 
books on the Kwakiutl (inhabi-
tants of the North-West Coast 
of America), the distinguished 
American ethnologist F. Boas 
gives no less than 156 recipes for 
preparing various kinds of fish, 
fruit, and wild root-vegetables. 
One of these, chosen at random, 
consists in beating up snow until 
it has the consistence of whipped 
cream and then mixing it with 
fish-oil, molasses and uncooked 
berries. 
Under the descriptive title Zuni 
Breadstuffs, a book by another 
ethnologist, Cushing, gives a fas-
cinating account of the produc-
tion and preparing food in this 
Pueblo Indian tribe of New Mexico. 
“Our cooks, unlike the 
tribal ones, have forgotten 
what was once an essential 
rite – that of doing honour 
to the animals about to be 
eaten, so that their species 
may not vanish from the 
earth.”

come across  disconcerting ins-
tructions in native recipes, such 
as the following (originating with 
the Tsimshian Indians of the nor-
thwest Pacific coast), which I 
offer as food for thought to hou-
sewives, on concluding this brief 
in t roduc t ion  to  cu l ina r y 
ethnology. 
When fat is to be extracted 
from olachen, the fish are first 
dried in the open air. They are 
then boiled in vessels filled with 
… of a ceremonial feast: the 
culinary preparations, the arran-
gement of the different kinds of 
vessels and mats, 
the despatch of 
messengers with 
the inv itat ions 
(which must be 
refused several 
times before final 
acceptance), the 
songs in honour of 
the guests, and the 
bestowal on each 
of them of a spe-
cially selected por-
tion, befitting his 
rank. 
There is nothing 
to surprise us in all 
this; Kwakiutl eti-
quette is not so different from our 
own formal dinners. We too honour 
our guests with embroidered 
cloths, silver plates and with 
choice dishes. But our cooks, 
unlike the tribal ones, have for-
gotten what was once an essential 
rite –that of doing honour to the 
animals about to be eaten, so that 
their species may not vanish from 
the earth. Thus we sometimes 
with another. This annual New 
Year festival, at which flowers and 
sweets, ties and illustrated cards 
change hands, is not then to be 
decided. It is an occasion when 
all men realise that the society in 
which they live is based on this 
very principle of give-and-take.

continue from page 30… gifts seems to have grown 
out of a like belief. It originated 
in the offering of green boughs 
to the Sabine King, Tatius, who 
shared the royal power with 
Romulus. These boughs were 
taken from the sacred wood of 
the goddess Strenia, and were 
thus called strenae in Latin, from 
which is derived the French, 
étrennes. 
Strenia was the goddess of 
strength. For the Romans and for 
the Maoris alike, presents were 
objects endowed with a special 
power through the act of giving. 
From where did this power come? 
By the exchange of gifts, often of 
mere token value, people give 
expression in outward and visible 
form to the inner spirit of commu-
nity life – spontaneous accep-
tance of interdependence one 
water into which stones heated in 
the fire are dropped, the fat being 
skimmed off as it rises to the sur-
face. The remainder of 
the fish is afterwards 
spread on a sieve 
above some recipient, 
and an old woman 
presses it to her naked 
breast as hard as she 
can, to squeeze out 
the rest of the fat 
(men are strictly for-
bidden to perform this 
degreasing operation). 
The cakes of fish 
are then heaped up in 
a corner of the hut, 
where they lie rotting 
until they swarm with 
maggots. Despite the 
intolerable stench, they must not 
be thrown away. Moreover, none 
of the “cooks” concerned is 
allowed to wash; every one must 
remain covered with filth until 
the end of the proceedings, which 
may last for two or three weeks. 
Otherwise the f ish would be 
“ashamed” and would never come 
back again. 

The important place 
social anthropology 
holds in the contempo-
rary thinking may seem 
paradoxical to many 
people. It is a science 
very much in vogue: 
witness not only the 
fashion for f ilms and 
books about travel, but 
also the interest of the 
educated public in 
books on anthropology. 
Towards the end of 
the 19th century people 
were apt to look to the 
biologist in their quest 
for a philosophy of man 
and the world, and then 
later to the sociologist, the histo-
rian, and even the philosopher. 
But for the past several years, 
anthropology has come to play 
the same role, and today it too is 
expected to provide us with deep 
reflections on our world and a 
philosophy of life and hope. 
It is in the United States that 
this approach to anthropology 
seems to have begun. As a young 
nation intent on creating a huma-
nism of its own, America broke 
with traditional European thin-
king. It saw no reason why the 
today’S CriSiS

At the time when African countries were gaining their independence, it seemed anthropology 
was about to fall victim to a dual conspiracy, fostered by the people hostile to it and those 
becoming extinct. What is the role of antropology in the modern world? Lévi-Strauss replies

civilizations of Greece and Rome 
should be admired to the exclu-
sion of all others merely because 
in the Old Wor ld of the 
Renaissance, when mankind came 
to be considered the most proper 
and necessary study of man, these 
were the only two civilizations 
sufficiently known. 
Since the 19th century and 
especially the 20th, practically 
every human society on our planet 
has become accessible to study. 
Why then limit our interests? And 
indeed, when we contemplate 
humanity in its entirety we cannot 
fail to recognize the fact that for 
99/100ths of mankind’s existence, 
and over most of the inhabited 
globe, there have been no cus-
toms, no beliefs, and no institu-
tions which do not fall within the 
prov ince of anthropological 
study. 
This was strikingly emphasised 
during the last war with the strug-
gle waged on a world-wide scale. 
Even the most obscure and remote 
corners of our planet were sud-
denly catapulted into our lives 
and consciousness and   …

tive” way of life, “primitive” thin-
king and “primitive” behaviour 
which have always been the sub-
ject of anthropological research. 
Without our realizing it, the “pri-
mitive” ways are transforming 
these civilizations from within. 
For the so-called primitive or 
archaic peoples do not simply 
vanish into a vacuum. They dis-
solve and are incorporated with a 
greater or lesser speed into the 
civilization surrounding them. At 
the same time the latter acquires 
a universal character.
Anthropology:  
a science without  
an object? 
Thus, far from diminishing in 
importance, primitive peoples 
concern us more with each passing 
day. To take only one example, the 
great civilization the West is justly 
proud of, and which has spread its 
roots across the inhabited globe, 
is everywhere emerging as a 
“hybrid”. Many foreign elements, 
both spiritual and material, are 
being absorbed into its stream. 
As a result, the problems of 
anthropology have ceased to be a 
matter for specialists, limited to 
scholars and explorers; they have 
become the direct and immediate 
concern of every one of us. 
Where then, lies the paradox? 
In reality there are two –insofar 
as anthropology is chiefly concer-
ned with the study of “primitive” 
peoples. At the moment when the 
public has come to recognize its 
true value, we may well ask 
whether it has   …
For even societies with the 
most widely divergent patterns of 
thought and whose customs and 
mores took thousands of years to 
evolve along isolated paths, 
impregnate one another once 
contact is established. This occurs 
in many, devious ways; sometimes 
we are clearly aware of them, 
often we are not. 
As they spread throughout the 
world, the civilizations which 
(rightly or wrongly) felt that they 
had reached the height of develo-
pment, such as Christianity, 
Islamism, Buddhism, and on a dif-
ferent level the technological 
civilization that unites them, 
become tinged with the “primi-
… took on three-dimensional 
reality. These were the lands where 
the last “savage” peoples on earth 
had sought safety in isolation – 
the far north of America, New 
Guinea, the hinterlands of south-
east Asia, and certain islands in 
the Indonesian archipelago.
Shrinking world
Since the war, many names, once 
charged w ith myster y and 
romance, have remained on our 
maps but now they designate 
landing spots for long-distance 
jet liners. Under the impact of 
aviation and with increase in 
world population, our planet has 
shrunk in size, and improved 
communications and travel faci-
lities permit us no longer to 
close our eyes or remain indiffe-
rent to other peoples. 
Today there is no fraction of 
the human race, no matter how 
remote and retarded it may still 
appear, which is not directly or 
indirectly in contact with others, 
and whose feelings, ambitions, 
desires and fears do not affect the 
security and prosperity and the 
very existence of those to whom 
material progress may once have 
given a feeling of ascendancy. 
Even if we wanted to, we could 
no longer ignore or shrug off with 
indifference, say, the last head-
hunters of New Guinea, for the 
simple reason that they are inte-
rested in us. And surprising 
though it may be, the result of 
our contacts with them means 
that both they and we are now 
part of the same world, and it will 
not be long before we are all part 
of the same civilization.

years ago, are now providing 
labour contingents for the buil-
ding of roads. And it is no rarity 
today to see road signs and 
milestones parachuted into the 
unexplored jungle! 
But with civilization have come 
strange diseases, against which 
“primitives” have no natural 
 immunization and which have 
wrought deadly havoc in their 
ranks. They are succumbing rapidly 
to tuberculosis, malaria, trachoma, 
leprosy, dysentery, gonorrhoea, 
syphilis and the mysterious disease 
known as Kuru. The result of pri-
mitive man’s contact with civiliza-
t ion, though not ac tual ly 
introduced by it, Kuru is a genetic 
deterioration which inevitably 
ends in death and for which no 
treatment or remedy is known. 
In Brazil, 100 tribes became 
extinct between 1900 and 1950. 
The Kaingang, from the state of 
Sao Paulo,  …
bered 250,000 individuals. Today 
no more than 40,000 are left. 
Official reports describe them 
herded in reserves or clustered 
near mining centres where in the 
place of their traditional wild food 
gathering parties they are redu-
ced to sneak-scavenging in rub-
bish heaps outside the mining 
shacks. Other aborigines, who had 
retreated deep into the forbidden 
desert, have been uprooted by the 
installation of atomic explosion 
bases or rocket launching sites.
Protected by its exceptionally 
hostile environment, New Guinea 
with its several million tribesmen 
may well be the last great sanc-
tuary of primitive society on 
earth. 
But here too, civilization is 
making such rapid inroads that 
the 600,000 inhabitants of the 
central mountains who were 
totally unknown as mere twenty 
… not reached the point 
where it has nothing more left to 
study. 
For the very transformations 
which are spurring a growing 
theoretical interest in “primiti-
ves” are in fact bringing about 
their extinction. This is not 
really a new phenomenon. As 
early as 1908, when he inaugura-
t ed  the  cha i r  o f  Soc ia l 
Anthropology at the University 
of Liverpool, Sir James Frazer 
(author of the monumental 
Golden Bough) dramat ically 
called the attention of govern-
ments and scholars to this very 
problem. Yet we can hardly com-
pare the situation half a century 
ago with the large-scale extinc-
tion of “primitive” peoples which 
we have witnessed since then. 
Let me cite a few examples. At 
the beginning of white settlement 
in Australia, the aborigines num-

society and culture, and even the limits of

inherent in the “structural” method that 
is currently favoured in scientific circles, of 
which Lévi-Strauss is known to be the most 
eminent representative.”

disorders, eye lesions and dental 
decay, unknown to primitive man 
when he lived according to his 
ancient ways, make 
their appearance when 
he is confined to villa-
ges and must eat food 
which does not come 
from his native forest. 
Then, even the old and 
tried traditional reme-
dies, such as charcoal 
dressings for severe 
burns, prove useless. 
And simple diseases to 
which tribesmen have 
long been accustomed, 
become extraordinary 
virulent. 
The decimation of 
the Indians is due to 
other, less direct causes, such as 
the collapse of the social struc-
ture or pattern of living. The 
Kaingang of Sao Paulo already 
mentioned, lived by a series of 
strict social rules with which 
every anthropologist is acquain-
ted. The inhabitants of each vil-
lage were divided into two groups 
on the principle that the men 
from the first group could marry 
only women from the second 
group and vice-versa. 
When their population dimi-
nished, the foundations permit-
ting their survival collapsed. 
Under the rigid system of the 
Kaingang, it was no longer possi-
ble for every man to find a wife 
and many had no choice but celi-
bacy unless they resigned them-
selves to mating within their own 
group – which to them was incest, 
and even then their marriage had 
to be childless. In such cases  …
Even water was lacking, and 
they were dying as much from 
hunger and thirst as from the 
disease. The children were craw-
ling about on the forest floor 
trying to keep the fires alight in 
the rain and hoping to keep warm. 
The men lay burning and paraly-
zed by fever; the women indiffe-
rently thrust away their babes 
seeking their breast.”
Indigenous 
superseded  
by indigent
In 1954, on the Guapore at the 
border of Brazil and Bolivia, a mis-
sion was established and four dif-
ferent tribes were incited to form 
a single group. For several months 
there were 400 people there, all of 
whom were exterminated by meas-
les shortly thereafter... 
But in addition to infectious 
diseases, vitamin and other nutri-
tional deficiencies are also an 
important problem. Motor-vascular 
… numbering 1,200 in 1912, 
were no more than 200 in 1916, 
and today have dwindled to 80. 
The Munduruku were 
20,000 in 1925 – in 1950 
they numbered 1,200. Of 
the 10,000 Nanmbikwara 
in 1900, I could trace only 
a thousand in 1940. The 
Kayapo of the r iver 
Araguaya were 2,500 in 
1902 and 10 in 1950. The 
Timbira 1,000 in 1900 and 
40 in 1950. 
How can this rapid 
decimation be explained? 
Foremost, by the intro-
duc t ion of  Wes te rn 
diseases against which 
the Indian’s body had no 
defence. The tragic fate of the 
Urubu, an Indian tr ibe from 
north-eastern Brazil, is typical of 
many others. In 1950, only a few 
years after they were discovered, 
they contracted the measles. 
Within a few days, out of the 
population of 750 there were 160 
deaths. An eyewitness has left 
this stark description: 
“We found the first village 
abandoned. All the inhabitants 
had fled, convinced that if they 
ran far away they would escape 
the sickness which they believed 
was a spirit attacking the village. 
We discovered them in the 
forest, halted in their flight. 
Exhausting and shivering with 
fever in the rain, nearly all of 
them had fallen victim to the 
disease. Intestinal and pulmonary 
complications had so weakened 
them that they no longer had 
strength to seek food.

Peoples who refuse 
to be the object of 
study
But this is only half of the pic-
ture. There are other parts of the 
world where tens and hundreds of 
millions of people live, who were 
tradit ionally the subject of 
anthropology. These populations 
are increasing rapidly in number 
in Central America, the Andes, 
south-east Asia and Africa. But 
here too, anthropology faces a 
crisis. Not because the popula-
tions are dying out  …
The Kaingang today
When Claude Lévi-Strauss published this text in the Unesco Courier, 
the Kaingang were making a painful recovery from several decades 
of extermination and massacre. The infant mortality rate of most 
of the groups was very high at that time, and the worst was to be 
feared, due to the devastation wreaked by malaria, tuberculosis 
and alcoholism. The Kaingang were then confined to reservations 
administered by the Indian Protection Service of the Brazilian 
federal government, and they were considered by specialists as 
being on the way to cultural dissolution and rapid assimilation in 
the national community.
Today, with a population estimated at approximately 30,000, 
spread over the four States in the South of the country — São 
Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul —, the Kaingang are one of the largest Amerindian groups in 
Brazil. Strong demographic growth over the last few decades means that the reservations are too small to contain a 
population that is young and more and more frequently attends school. 
Despite the migration to cities, the bonds with territory and traditions remain essential. These bonds are concretely 
expressed by the desire to revitalize and modernize the Kaingang identity, particularly by promoting the learning 
of the language and the transmission of the oral tradition. Furthermore, the Kaingang consider themselves as fully-
fledged Brazilian citizens. From an anthropological point of view, this is one of the many paradoxes of globalisation, 
which is accompanied by a vigorous affirmation of local identities. 
Contemporary anthropology has not become a science without an ‘object’. On the contrary, it is enjoying unprecedented 
growth, largely as a result of the lesson the young fledgling ethnologist Claude Lévi-Strauss learnt in 1935 from 
his very first meeting with Amerindians, a small group of Kaingang in the State of Paraná in Brazil. In his famous 
work Tristes Tropiques Lévi-Strauss wrote that he was struck by the level of social decomposition of this group, who 
appeared to him to be neither “real Indians”, nor “savages”, nor “pure Indians”. From this meeting, Lévi-Strauss 
retained the lesson of prudence and objectivity, which is still relevant to anthropology today, and which consisted 
in not being satisfied with external appearances when faced with a culture that had suffered from the onslaught of 
colonialism.

… a whole population can 
disappear within a few years. 
[These observations on the disap-
pearance of the Indians of Brazil 
are drawn chiefly from a study by 
the noted Brazilian anthropolo-
gist, Dr Darcy Ribeiro, entitled 
“Conviv io et Contaminaçao” 
published in “Sociologica”, Vol. 
XVIII, No. 1 Sao Paulo, 1956]. 
Bearing this in mind, need we 
be surprised that it is more diffi-
cult not only to study the so- 
called primitive peoples but even 
to define them satisfactorily. In 
recent years, a serious attempt 
has been made to revise existing 
thinking regarding protective 
legislation in the countries facing 
this problem. 
Neither language nor culture 
nor the conviction of belonging to 
a group, are valid as criteria for a 
definition. As enquiries of the 
International Labour Organization 
have emphasized, the notion of 
indigenous people is being super-
seded by the concept of indigence.

social customs destroyed, to 
create sharper observation tech-
niques, rather like the astronomer 
who has brought electronic ampli-
fiers into play to capture the wea-
kening signals of light from 
distant stars racing away from 
us.
The second crisis in anthropo-
logy is much less serious in the 
absolute since there is no threat 
of extinction to the civilizations 
concerned. But it is much more 
difficult to deal with it out of 
hand. I wonder whether it would 
help matters if we tried to dispel 
the distrust of the people who 
were formerly the anthropologist’s 
field work by proposing that our 
research should henceforth no 
longer be “one way only”. Might 
not anthropology find its place 
again if, in exchange for our conti-
nued freedom to investigate, we 
invited African or Melanesian 
anthropologists to come and study 
us in the same way that up to now 
only we have studied them? 
Such an exchange would be 
very desirable for it would enrich 
the science of anthropology by 
w idening it s 
hor izons, and 
set us on the 
road to further 
progress. But let 
us have no illu-
sions- this would 
not resolve the 
problem, for it 
does not take 
into considera-
tion the deep 
motives under-
lying the former 
colonised peo-
ples  …
take advantage of the few years 
that remain to gather all the 
information we can on these 
vanishing islands of humanity. 
Such information is vital for, 
unlike the natural sciences, the 
sciences of man cannot originate 
their own experimentation. 
Every type of society, of belief 
or institution, every way of life, 
constitutes a ready-made experi-
ment for which preparation has 
taken thousands of years and as 
such is irreplaceable. When a 
community disappears, a door 
closes forever, locking away 
knowledge which is unique. 
That is why the anthropologist 
believes that it is essential, before 
these societies are lost and their 
… but because of the nature 
of the people involved. 
These peoples are changing and 
their civilizations are gradually 
becoming westernized Anthropo-
logy, however, has never yet inclu-
ded the West within its competence 
or province. Furthermore, and 
even more important, there is a 
growing opposition in these 
regions to anthropological enqui-
ries. Instances have occurred 
where regional museums of 
“Anthro-pology” have been forced 
to change their names and can 
only continue disguised as 
“Museums of Popular Art and 
Tradition”. 
In the young states which have 
recently obtained independence, 
economists, psychologists and 
sociologists are warmly welcomed 
by universities. The same can 
hardly be said of anthropologists. 
Thus it would almost seem that 
anthropology is on the point of 
falling victim to a dual conspi-
racy. On the one hand are the 
peoples who have ceased physi-
cally to lend themselves to study 
but are simply vanishing 
from the face of the 
earth. On the other are 
those who, far from 
dead, are living a great 
population “explosion”, 
yet are categorically 
hostile to anthropology 
for psychological and 
ethical reasons. 
There is no problem 
about how to meet the 
first of these crises. 
Research must be spee-
ded up and we must

that logically and morally, it is 
almost impossible to continue to 
v iew societies as scientif ic 
objects, which the scientists may 
even wish to preserve, but which 
are now collective subjects and 
claim the right to change as they 
please. 
The modification of 
anthropology’s subject 
matter also implies modi-
fications in its aims and 
methods. And these for-
tunately appear quite 
feasible for our branch of 
science has never defi-
ned its purposes in the 
absolute but rather as a 
relationship between the 
observer and his subject. 
And it has always agreed 
to change whenever this 
relationship has been 
modified. 
Doubtless, the pro-
perty of anthropology 
has always been to inves-
tigate on the spot of “from 
within”. But only because it was 
impossible to investigate at a dis-
tance or “from without”. In the 
field of the social sciences, the 
great revolution of our times is 
that whole civilizations have 
become conscious of their exis-
tence, and having acquired the 
necessary means to do so through 
literacy, have embarked on the 
study of their own past and tradi-
tions and every unique aspect of 
their culture which has survived 
to the present day. 
Thus, if Africa, for instance, is 
escaping from anthropology, it 
will not so easily escape from 
science. In place  …
Yet these very anthropologists 
–and indeed all anthropology– are 
now accused of denying this infe-
riority merely to conceal it, and 
hence of contributing more or less 
direc t ly to it s  cont inued 
existence.
Science  
“from without”, 
anthropology 
becoming science 
“from within”
If therefore, anthropology is to 
survive in the modern world, 
there can be no disguising that it 
must be at the price of much 
deeper change than a mere enlar-
ging of the circle (very restricted 
it is true up to now) by the rather 
childish formula of offering to 
lend our toys to the newcomers 
provided they let us go on playing 
with theirs. 
Anthropology must transform 
its very nature and must admit 
… negative attitude to 
anthropology. They are afraid that 
under the cloak of an anthropolo-
gical interpretation of history 
what they consider to be intolera-
ble inequality will be justified as 
the des irable divers it y  of 
mankind. 
If I may be per-
mitted a formula 
which, coming from 
an anthropologist, 
can have no dero-
gatory connotation 
even as pure scien-
tific observation, I 
would say that 
Westerners w il l 
never (except in 
make believe) be 
able to act the role 
of “savages” oppo-
site those whom 
they once domina-
ted. For when we 
Westerners cast 
them in this role 
they existed for us 
only as objects –whether for scien-
tific study or political and econo-
mic domination. Whereas we, who 
in their eyes are responsible for 
their past fate, now appear to 
them inevitably as directing forces 
and therefore it is much harder or 
them to look at us with an atti-
tude of detached appraisal. 
By a curious paradox, it was 
undoubtedly a feeling of sympa-
thy that prompted many anthro-
pologists to adopt the idea of 
pluralism (this asserts the diver-
sity of human cultures and conco-
mitantly denies that certain 
civilizations can be classified as 
“super ior ”  and other s  as 
“inferior”)

Who knows if the 
conflict between the old 
and new generations, 
which so many countries 
are now experiencing, 
may not be the ransom 
that must be paid for the 
growing homogenization 
of our social and material 
culture? Such phenomena 
seem to me pathological 
but anthropology has 
always been characterized 
by its ability to explain 
and just if y forms of 
human behaviour which 
men found strange and 
could not understand. 
In this way anthropo-
logy at every phase has 
helped to enlarge the cur-
rently held and always too 
constricting view of humanity. To 
picture the disappearance of 
anthropology, one would have to 
conjure up a civilization where all 
men – no matter what corner of 
the globe they inhabited, and 
 whatever their way of life, their 
education, their professional acti-
vities, their ages, beliefs, sympa-
thies and aversions – were, to the 
very roots of their consciousness, 
totally intelligible to all other 
men. 
Whether one deplores it, 
 approves it, or merely states it as a 
fact, technical progress and the 
development of communications 
hardly seem to be leading us to this 
end. And as long as the ways of 
 thinking or of acting of some men 
perplex other men, there will be 
scope for meditation on these dif-
ferences; and this, in a constantly 
renewing form, will be the abiding 
province of anthropology.  
our last fields of investigation, in 
place of the weapons, tools and 
household objects which have 
disappeared. But also because as 
Western civilization becomes more 
complex with each passing day 
and spreads across the whole of 
the earth, it is already beginning 
to show signs of the sharp diffe-
rences which anthropology has 
made it its business to study but 
which it could formerly do only by 
comparing dissimilar and widely 
separated cultures. 
Here no doubt, lies the perma-
nent function of anthropology. 
For if there exists, as anthropolo-
gists have always affirmed, a cer-
tain “optimum diversity” which 
they see as a permanent condition 
of human development, then we 
may be sure that divergences 
between societies and groups 
within societies will disappear 
only to spring up in other forms. 
… of the anthropolo-
gist – that is the outside 
analyst, working from the 
outside – study of the conti-
nent will be in the hands of 
African scientists, or forei-
gners who will use the same 
methods as their African 
colleagues. 
They will no longer be 
anthropologists but linguists, 
philologists, historians of 
facts and ideas. Anthropology 
will gladly accept this transi-
tion to richer, more subtle 
methods than its own, confi-
dent that it has fulfilled its 
mission by keeping alive so 
much of the great riches of 
humanity on behalf of scien-
tific knowledge, so long as it 
was the only branch of 
science able to do so.
Diversity, 
anthropology’s  
reason for being
As to the future of anthropology 
itself, it seems to lie now at the 
far extreme and the near extreme 
of its traditional positions. At the 
far extreme, in the geographical 
sense first, since we must go fur-
ther and further afield to reach 
the last of the so-called primitive 
populations, and they are getting 
fewer and fewer; but in the far 
extreme in its logical meaning 
too, since we are now interested 
in the essentials. 
On the near extreme, in the 
sense that the collapse of the 
material foundations of the last 
primitive civilizations has made 
their intimate experiences one of

[…] The author of the present 
article hopes he is not abusing 
his freedom in confessing to the 
embarrassment, not to say uneasi-
ness, he felt at the announcement 
of the survey decided upon by the 
UNESCO General Conference’s 
resolution. In his view, the inte-
rest shown in the “main trends of 
research in the social and human 
sciences” is in sharp contrast to 
the way in which these sciences 
have been ignored and neglected 
in the very quarters where the 
greatest enthusiasm has been 
shown for the project. […] 
We should not 
have voiced similar 
doubts with regard 
to the prev ious 
survey of the trends 
of research in the 
natural sciences. But 
there the situation 
was different: those

have furnished so 
many and such stri-

their reality is no

phical hope which has yet to be 
conf irmed. The paral lel ism 
implied, even if only by the titles 
of the two surveys, therefore 
reveals a somewhat fanciful 
conception of the facts. […] 
But, before we start looking 
for a solution which will inevita-
bly be unsatisfactory, it may be 
useful to review briefly 
cer t a in cont r ibutor y 
causes of the disparity 
between the physical and 
the human sciences. […] 
To tell the truth, the 
function of the human 
sciences seems to lie 
 halfway between explana-
tion and anticipation, as if 
they were unable to make 
a definite choice between 
the two roles. This does 
not mean that these scien-
ces are useless from both 
the theoretical and the 
practical  …
A semantic 
fiction
The author of the pre-
sent report has devo-
ted his whole life to 
the social and human 
sciences. But he has not the sli-
ghtest reluctance to admit that 
there can be no pretence that 
they and the natural sciences are 
really on an equal footing, or to 
acknowledge that the latter are 
indeed sciences while the former 
are not; and that if the same term 
is, none the less, applied to both, 
it is done on the strength of a 
a diffiCult Survey
UNESCO’s decision to undertake a survey on the main 
trends of research in the social and human sciences 
did not delight Lévi-Strauss. In this 13 March 1964 
text, of which we are printing excerpts, he points out 
the problems this project raises.

that, while the criterion of 
 scientific knowledge can be 
defined only by reference to 
Western science (which, it 
seems, no society will contest), 
the social and human sciences 
with the best claim to inclu-
sion are by no means all 
Western. Modern linguists rea-
dily admit that, as criteria of 
science in the social and 
human disciplines regards cer-
tain fundamental discoveries, 
Indian grammarians were seve-
ral centuries ahead of them; 
and this is probably not the 
only field in which the advan-
tage will have to be conceded 
to Eastern and Far Eastern 
knowledge. 
In another sphere, ethnolo-
gists today are convinced that 
even societies at a very low 
technical and economic level, 
unacquainted with writing, 
have sometimes succeeded in 
giving their political or social 
institutions a conscious and 
considered character, which 
imparts a scientific value to them. 
[…] 
If the progress of knowledge 
should eventually demonstrate that 
the social and human sciences 
deserve the name of sciences, the 
proof will come from experience: 
by verifying that he world of scien-
tific knowledge is round, and in 
the belief that they are moving 
away from each other to achieve 
the status of positive sciences, 
although by opposite routes, the 
social and the human sciences, 
without even realizing it, will 
merge with the exact and natural 
sciences from which they will no 
longer be distinguishable. 
position. But the alternative 
would raise practically insupera-
ble difficulties […] 
I have proposed that the only 
researches to be used as a basis 
for the survey should be those 
capable of satisfying an external 
criterion – that of conformity to 
the standards of sc ient if ic 
knowledge as generally accepted, 
not only by specialists in the 
social and human sciences (which 
would bring in the danger of a 
vicious circle) but also by those 
in the exac t and natural 
sciences. 
On this basis, a very wide 
consensus should be obtainable. 
But it will at once be remarked 
… points of view, but 
rather that their usefulness 
has to be gauged by refe-
rence to both, neither of 
which can ever be conside-
red entirely alone but, when 
combined, produce a new 
attitude in which the pecu-
liar mission of the human 
sciences is epitomized. The 
human sciences never – or 
very seldom – explain com-
pletely, and they do not 
predict with complete cer-
tainty. But, for all that they 
may only understand a quar-
ter or a half of what they 
have to consider, and may 
be able to foresee only in 
one out of two or four cases, 
they are yet able, because 
of the intimate connexion 
between these half-measu-
res, to give to those who 
practise them something 
that comes between pure 
knowledge and practical 
efficiency – discrimination, 
or at any rate, a certain kind of 
discrimination which makes it 
possible, with slightly better 
understanding, to act a little less 
clumsily, although without ever 
being able to determine exactly 
what is owed to either of the two 
aspects. […]
What sciences are we 
talking about?
Should the “trends” of research in 
the survey be those of contempo-
rary Western science, or should 
all the reflections on man produ-
ced at other periods and in other 
parts of the world be included? 
From a theoretical point of view, 
it is hard to see what principle 
could justify taking up the first

Science Council (ISSC) 
when it was founded 
in 1952-1953 and the 
f irst President was 
Donald Young. The 
Director-General of 
UNESCO was Jaime

had little contact 
with him. I served as 
ISSC Secretary-Gene-

when I was elected to the Collège

I could concentrate on teaching. 
During those years, my closest

became my colleague at the École

early days of the ISSC that almost 
became a crisis. Some Soviets had

Promoting cultural

During those years, the two most 
memorable personalities I was 
involved with were Otto Klineberg 
(from Canada) and Alfred Métraux 
(from Switzerland).  …
Americans who were going to take 
part in the meeting found out 
about it when they arrived in 
Paris. It was at the height of 
McCarthyism. They threatened to 
leave the next day, which would 
have compromised holding the 
meeting. Finally, the Soviets 
didn’t come and the incident was 
closed. 
At UNESCO I was mainly in 
contact with the Social Science 
department – at the time headed

The promotion of cultural

York during the time I lived in 
the United States, from 1941 to 
1947, when he was a professor at 
Columbia University. As for 
Métraux, he was a remarkable 
anthropologist with a post at 
UNESCO in the Social Science 
department, and his work was 
very influential. I believe in fact 
that Edgardo Krebs (from Argen-
tina) is preparing an exhibition 
about Métraux at the Smithso-
nian Institution. 
The gist of the ISSC’s work 
consisted of promoting exchan-
ges between the different disci-
plines, by bringing together 
people from very different bac-
kgrounds like anthropologists, 
sociologists, economists, psycho-
