The geometry of beauty
This tiny statuette 45cm. (18 in.)
high to which the skill of an
African wood carver has given
an almost geometric beauty by
the subtle simplicity of its form,
is believed to be an ancestor
figure. The work of an unknown
craftsman of the Ati, a people
living in the area where the
savannah reaches down into the
southern forest of the Ivory
Coast, it has much in common
with the sculptural style of the
Baule, a major group of the
neighbouring central Guinea
coast, in whose art woodcarving
is also given pride of place.

"S.O.S. Environment" is the
theme of this special issue
inspired, on the one hand, by a
warning from 2,200 scientists
presented a few weeks ago to
U.N. Secretary-General U Thant,
and, on the other, by the
discussions at a world
symposium on social aspects
of environmental disruption,
held in Tokyo last year under
the auspices of the International
Social Science Council, with
Unesco's support.

<![CDATA[
w,IDELY separated though we are geographically,
with very different cultures, languages, attitudes, political
and religious loyalties, we are united in our time by an
unprecedented common danger. This danger, of a nature
and magnitude never before faced by man, is born of a
confluence of several phenomena. Each of them would
present us with almost unmanageable problems; together
they present not only the probability of vast increases in
human suffering in the immediate future, but the possibility
of the extinction, or virtual extinction, of human life on
Earth.
As biological and other environmental scientists, we do
not speak to the feasibility of particular solutions to these
problems, but out of our conviction that the problems exist,
are global and interrelated, and that solutions can be found
only if we abandon limited selfish interests to the realization
of a common need.
A message signed by 2,200 scientists from
23 countries, addressed to their "three and a half
billion neighbours on planet earth", warning of the
"unprecedented common danger" facing mankind,
was handed to United Nations Secretary-General
U Thant at a simple ceremony in New York on
May 11, 1971.
To the six distinguished scientists who presented
the message, (reproduced in full on these pages)
the Secretary-General declared:
"I believe that mankind is at last aware of the fact
that there is a delicate equilibrium of physical and
biological phenomena on and around the earth
which cannot be thoughtlessly disturbed as we race
along the road of technological development... This
global concern in the face of a grave common dan¬
ger, which carries the seeds of extinction for the
human species, may well prove to be the elusive
force which can bind men together. The battle for
human survival can only be won by all nations
joining together in a concerted drive to preserve
life on this planet."
Since it was originally drafted, at a meeting at
Menton, in France, the "Menton Message" as it has
come to be known, has been circulated among bio¬
logists and environmental scientists in Europe
North America, Africa, Asia and South America.
The meeting was convened by a new, voluntary,
non-governmental, transnational peace movement
known as "Dai Dong". Literally the name means
"a world of the great togetherness", a concept
which originated in pre-Confucian China more than
2,500 years ago.
Among the 2,200 signatories of the Menton Mes¬
sage are four Nobel Prize laureates (Salvador
Luria, Jacques Monod, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and'
George Wald), and such famous names from the
world of science as Jean Rostand, Sir Julian Huxley,
Thor Heyerdahl, Paul Ehrlich, Margaret Mead, René
Dumont, Lord Ritchie-Calder, Shutaro Yamamoto,
Gerardo Budowski, Enrique Beltran and Mohamed
Zaki Barakat.
THE PROBLEMS
Environmental Deterioration. The quality of our environ¬
ment is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate. It is more
obvious in some parts of the world than in others, and in
those areas public alarm has begun to express itself, while
in other areas environmental deterioration seems a remote
and irrelevant phenomenon.
But there is only one environment; what happens to a part
affects the whole. The most widely recognized example
of this process is the penetration into food-chains all over
the world of poisonous substances such as mercury, lead,
cadmium, DDT, and other chlorinated organic compounds,
which have been found in the tissues of birds and other
animals far removed from the origin of the poisons.
Oil spills, industrial refuse, and effluents of various kinds
have adversely affected nearly all fresh and inshore waters
around the world as have sewage and organic wastes
released in amounts too great to be taken care of by the
normal recycling processes of nature. Cities are overhung
with heavy clouds of smog, and air-borne pollutants have
killed trees hundreds of miles from their source.
Even more alarming are our continued and reckless ven¬
tures into new technological processes and projects (e.g.,
the supersonic transport and the planned proliferation of
nuclear power plants) without a pause to consider their
possible long-term effects on the environment.
Depletion of Natural Resources. Although Earth and its
resources are finite and in part exhaustible; industrial
society is using up many of its non-renewable resources
and mismanaging potentially renewable ones, and it exploits
the resources of other countries without regard for the
deprivation of present populations or the needs of future
generations.
The Earth is already beginning to run short of some
materials of critical importance to a technological society,
and plans are being made to mine minerals from beneath
the oceans. But such efforts not only will require vast
expenditures of money and energy (and our energy-pro¬
ducing fuels are limited), but should not be undertaken
before careful studies have been made of their probable
effects on marine animal and plant life, also part of our
natural resources and a source of high-protein food.
Almost all of the world's well-watered, fertile farmland is
already in use. Yet each year, especially in industrialized
nations, millions of acres of this land aré iak^n out of
cultivation for use as industrial sites, roads, parking lots, etc.
Deforestation, damming of rivers, one-crop farming, un¬
controlled use of pesticides and defoliants, strip-mining and
other short-sighted or unproductive practices have contri¬
buted to an ecological imbalance that has already had
catastrophic effects in some areas and over a long term
may adversely affect the productivity of large sections of
the world.

<![CDATA[
Even under the best of circumstances, the Earth could
not provide resources in amounts sufficient to enable all
people to live at the level of consumption enjoyed by the
majority in the industrial societies, and the contrast between
life styles dictated by extreme poverty and those permitted
by affluence will continue to be a source of conflict and
revolution.
Population, Overcrowding and Hunger. The present
population of Earth is estimated at 3,500 million people, and
calculations, based on success of present population
control programmes, put it at 6,500 million by the year 2000.
There have been some optimistic predictions that techno¬
logical and natural resources can be developed to feed,
clothe and house far larger populations than this.
The immediate fact is, however, that as many as two-
thirds of the world's present population are suffering from
malnutrition and that the threat of large-scale famine is still
with us despite some nutritional advances. Pollution and
ecological disruption are already affecting some food
sources, and frequently efforts to raise nutritional standards
are themselves polluting.
Moreover, population figures are misleading, since they
do not take into consideration the factor of consumption.
It has been estimated that a child born in the United States
today will consume during his lifetime at least twenty times
as much as one born in India, and contribute about fifty
times as much pollution to the environment. In terms of
environmental impact, therefore, the most industrialized
countries are also the most densely populated.
Man's ".need for space and a degree of solitude, though
difficult to state in precise terms, is real and observable.
We do not live by bread alone. Even if technology could
produce enough synthetic food for all, overcrowding pro¬
duced by ever-rising populations is likely to have disastrous
social and ecological consequences.
War. Throughout history there has been no human
activity so universally condemned and so universally prac¬
tised as war, and research on ever more destructive
weaponry and methods of warfare has been unremitting.
Now that we have achieved the ultimate weapon and
seen its potential, we have recoiled from its further use,
but our fear has not kept us from filling our arsenals with
enough nuclear warheads to wipe out all life on earth
several times over, or from blind and heedless experiments,
both in the laboratory and in the battlefield, with biological
and chemical weapons. Nor has it kept us from engaging
in "small" wars or aggressive actions that may lead to
nuclear war.
Even if a final, major war is avoided, preparation for it
uses up physical and human resources that ought to be
spent in an effort to find ways of feeding and housing the
world's deprived people and of saving and improving the
environment.
It is clear that it is insufficient to attribute war to the
natural belligerence of mankind when men have in fact
succeeded in establishing at some points stable and rel¬
atively peaceful societies in limited geographical areas. In
our time it is apparent that the dangers of global war focus
at two points:
the inequality that exists between industrialized and
non-industrialized parts of the world, and the determina¬
tion of millions of impoverished human beings to improve
their lot;
the competition for power and economic advantage
among anarchic nation-states unwilling to relinquish self¬
ish interests in order to create a more equable society.
Stated thus, the problem seems almost insoluble. Yet
mankind has demonstrated improbable resources of adap¬
tability and resiliency in the past and perhaps facing what
may well be the ultimate challenge to its survival, it will
confound our fears once again.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
The preceding is only a partial listing of the problems
that confront us and makes scarcely any attempt to describe
their causes. We really do not know the full dimensions
of either our problems or their solutions. We do know that
Earth and all of its inhabitants are in trouble and that our
problems will multiply if we do not attend to them.
In the 1940s, when it was decided to develop the atomic
bomb, the United States appropriated 2,000 million dollars
and brought experts from all over the world to do the job
in two years. In the 1960s, preoccupied with the race to
the moon, the United States spent between 20,000 and
40,000 million dollars to win the race, and both the Soviet
Union and the U.S. continue to spend thousands of millions
of dollars in space exploration.
Certainly massive research into the problems that
threaten the survival of mankind deserves a higher priority
than atomic or space research. It should be begun at
once on a similar scale and with an even greater sense of
urgency. Such research should be paid for by the industrial
nations, which are not only financially best able to carry
that burden, but themselves are the principal users of
resources and the major polluters, but it should be carried
out by qualified men from all countries and various pro¬
fessions, unfettered by restrictive nationalistic policies.
Because the crisis is so pressing, however, we urge that
the following actions be taken even while research is going
on. We do not offer these as panaceas, but as holding
actions to keep our situation from deteriorating past the
point of no return:
A moratorium on technological innovations the effects of
which we cannot foretell and which are not essential to
human survival. This would include new weapons systems,
luxury transport, new and untested pesticides, the manu¬
facture of new plastics, the establishment of vast new
nuclear power projects, etc. It would also include eco¬
logically unresearched engineering projects the damming
of great rivers, "reclamation" of jungle land, undersea
mining projects, etc.
' The application of existing pollution-control technology
to the generation of energy and to industry generally, large-
scale recycling of materials in order to slow down the
exhaustion of resources, and the rapid establishment of
international agreements on environmental quality, subject to
review as environmental needs become more fully known.
Intensified programmes in all regions of the world to curb
population growth, with full regard for the necessity of
accomplishing this without abrogation of civil rights. It is
important that these programmes should be accompanied
by a decrease in the level of consumption by privileged
classes, and that a more equitable distribution of food and
other goods among all people be developed.
Regardless of the difficulty of achieving agreements,
nations must find a way to abolish war, to defuse their
nuclear armaments, and to destroy their chemical and bio¬
logical weapons. The consequences of a global war would
be immediate and irreversible, and it is therefore also the
responsibility of individuals and groups to refuse to parti¬
cipate in research or processes that might, if used, result in
the extermination of the human species.
Earth, which has seemed so large, must now be seen
in its smallness. We live in a closed system, absolutely
dependent on Earth and on each other for our lives and
those of succeeding generations. The many things that
divide us are therefore of infinitely less importance than
the interdependence and danger that unite us.
We believe that it is literally true that only by transcending
our divisions will men be able to keep Earth as their home.
Solutions to the actual problems of pollution, hunger, over¬
population and war may be simpler to find than the formula
for the common effort through which the search for solutions
must occur, but we must make a beginning. '

Last year, the International Social
Science Council, sponsored by
Unesco, held a World Symposium
in Tokyo to study social aspects
of environmental disruption.
All the following articles (with
the exception of the interview
with Mr. Boris Vo/tovski)
are based on the lively discussions
and presentations that marked
this Symposium. Speaking of
the real challenge facing
the social sciences with regard
to environmental disruption,
the Secretary-General of the
International Social Science
Council, Dr. S. Friedman,
underlined the importance of the
Symposium. It would, he said,
"draw the attention of
governments and international
agencies to the tasks which have
to be urgently undertaken to
protect man and society from
some of the greatest dangers
brought about by technological

A
j^r^^Japanese dictionary com¬
piled in 1955 and intended to cover
all the words currently in use in Japan
carries no mention of the word kogai.
But kogai has become one of the most
widely discussed issues in Japan.
The term kogai, which literally
means "disamenities inflicted on the
public", was first used in Japan's
Rivers Act of 1896, and has nowadays
come to gain wide currency, covering
not only environmental pollutions of all
kinds, but also various undesirable
side effects of economic activities.
When a wide circulation Tokyo daily
asked all the election candidates in
SHIGETO TSURU, a leading Japanese eco¬
nomist, is professor of economics at Hitot-
subashi University, Tokyo. He is head of
Japan's Economic Research Institute and a
member of his country's National Resources
Investigation Council.
December 1969 what Tokyo lacked
most, virtually all of them replied,
"clean air and a clear sky".
A classic example of kogai in
Japan is the story of Ashio, a town on
the Watarasé River, 100 kilometres
north of Tokyo. Copper was discov¬
ered there in 1610, and the Ashio mine
remained a top supplier of copper for
two centuries and a half under the
management of the central feudal
government of Tokugawa.
After the Meiji Restoration the mine
was transferred in 1871 to a private
firm, and from 1877 a process of
ruthless entrepreneurship turned it
into a major copper-refining centre.
But this modernization and the new¬
found prosperity of the copper indus¬
try inevitably brought spillover effects
of an undesirable kind. The first vic¬
tims, in 1880, were the fish in the
Watarasé River, tight years later it
'was the turn of the rice crops which
depended on the river for irrigation
(the Watarasé waters directly affected
200,000 hectares of cultivated and den¬
sely inhabited land). Finally, the health
of persons living along the river began
to suffer.
A protest movement against the
Ashio copper refining began in a
somewhat timid fashion and did not
make a dint in the composure of a
rising capitalistic firm. The copper
producers took a superior attitude by
denying any connexion between their
operation and the woes of the farmers
along the river.
By adopting a position of non¬
interference, the government of the
time actually sided with the copper
interest, for it would have been easy
for the government to launch an inves¬
tigation into the spillover effects of

or "public nuisance," and signifies pollution. Above, an aerial view of Keihin, the vast

copper-refining and to establish firmly
that the connexion alleged by the far¬
mers really existed.
The protest movement gained mo¬
mentum after Shozo Tanaka, an ener¬
getic Diet member from the region,
became its leader. Tanaka dramatized
the issue in the Diet, spent days and
nights with the farmers in consolidating
the protest organization, and finally
made a direct appeal to the Emperor
in 1901.
Tanaka's efforts wrested some
concessions from the copper firm and
induced the government to set up a
committee of investigation. But the
only concessions offered were the
payment of compensation, calculated
more to bribe village elders than to
justly recompense the damage caused,
and the promise that a "filtering
device" would be imported from Ger¬
many and installed. This turned out
to be a device for recovering re-usable
waste and did not bring the improve¬
ment which the farmers had been led
to expect.
The protest movement went on more
violently than before, reminiscent of the
tenant farmers' riots in the past. The
most radical protesters were farmers

government struck a fatal blow at the
movement by designating the Yanaka
area as reserve land for emergency
overflow from the Tone River. Farmers
were forced to leave the land and were
given a pittance as compensation. And
with this defeat the Ashio protest
movement was rapidly eclipsed.
It is characteristic of the story of
Ashio that the kogai problem was
fought mainly as a political issue and
never became a legal one. The source
of pollution was clearly identifiable
and should have led to the drafting of
new laws to cover strife of this kind.
But the legal specialists of the day
failed to respond to the challenge.
The spirit of the times was such that
nothing could be allowed to halt the
engine of economic growth and pros¬
perity. It was quite natural, for exam¬
ple, for the people of Yawata the first

No city today would advertise
"billows of smoke" in its sky.
The defeat in the last war crushed
the military ambition of Japan, which
for more than half a century had given
a peculiar twist to the country's poli¬
tical and economic development. With
the defeat, however, came a new and
immediate imperative of economic
rehabilitation, and at the nadir of eco¬
nomic activity in 1945, all other con¬
siderations appeared secondary.
In retrospect, some glaring cases of
kogai could be traced back to the
postwar years, but it was not until
around 1955 by which time Japan's
per capita income had regained the
prewar level of 1934-36 that the kogai
problem as a public issue started to
attract wide attention. Three incidents
in particular helped to dramatize the
issue: the kogai of the Yokkaichi petro-

these demonstrators in Tokyo. Despite strict regulations enacted
over recent years, environmental pollution is rising in Japan and is

chemical centre, the methylmercury
poisoning in the Minamata area, and
the cadmium poisoning along the
Jintsu River.
The city of Yokkaichi faces the Bay
of Isé in central Japan. It started out
as a port city in modern times com¬
bined with a scenic bathing beach.
When, in 1955, the Mitsubishi-Shell
interest bought the former site of a
naval fuel depot and began construct¬
ing an oil-refining and petrochemical
complex, the city authorities saw the
possibility of transforming Yokkaichi
into a great industrial centre.
A group of "regional development"
experts was commissioned to draft a
"Yokkaichi Master Plan", and a gigan¬
tic piece of reclamation was begun
along the scenic seashore. The "plan"
spoke of "a birth of a new industrial
city with abundant sunlight and green
spaces"; but foresight was lacking.
There was no suggestion of moving
either the residential section along the
seashore or the congested urban cen¬
tre near the port facilities.
The result was that one of the best
residential sections, constructed by the
Yokkaichi municipality, lost its scenic
view of the bay and found itself sep¬
arated from a huge thermal electric
plant by only a narrow strip of road.
The first group of the petrochemical
complex (in the Shiohama area) was
completed in 1960, and the second
group (in the Umaokoshi area) in Nov¬
ember 1963. Industrial production in
the city grew by leaps and bounds.
Within five years shipments of manu¬
factured products more than doubled
in Yokkaichi compared with an already
impressive national growth rate of
70 per cent.
Meanwhile, spillover effects of in¬
dustrial operations, and particularly air
pollution, gradually became noticeable.
In 1959, one year after the first petro¬
chemical plant began operating, asth¬
matic complaints became unusually
frequent in the Shiohama area and the
death rate among older women sud¬
denly soared. As cases of this
bronchial ailment increased, it soon
became known as "Yokkaichi asthma"
and started attracting wide attention.
But respiratory troubles were only
one of the misfortunes of the citizens.
Indeed, Yokkaichi presented an
"ideal" case of kogai in multiple form.
Kogai in almost all its modern forms
the pollution of the air by sulphur
oxides, smoke and various kinds of
dust particles; noise and vibration;
water pollution; offensive odours
began to plague the people of Yokkai¬
chi about 1960.
The Municipal Health Centre kept a
record of all the complaints received
and these show a marked rising trend:
from 36 in 1960 to 670 in 1966. In
particular, complaints of offensive
odours suddenly soared after 1963.

<![CDATA[
The sources were identified in most
cases as volatile organic matters (such
as butadiene, naphtha, acrylic esters,
etc.) contained in the factory drainage
wastes. But ordinary citizens were not
the only ones to complain. Before
long, one spillover effect in Yokkaichi
began to harm the fishing industry.
At the mouth of the Suzuka River,
south of the Shiohama industrial area,
is a small fishing village. After 1960,
complaints were made that fish caught
in the traditional fishing grounds of the
Bay of Isé smelled peculiar, and soon
the fishermen were accusing the Miye
Thermal Plant which drained its cooling
waters at the mouth of the river near
the village.
The Electric Generating Company
would not take any action and as the
damage to fish increased, the fisher¬
men took the law into their own Bands,
by throwing sandbags into the drain¬
pipe. An intervention by the Prefectural
Governor brought a settlement by
compensation, but an investigation
clearly showed that the thermal plant
was only an intermediary in the dam¬
age caused.
The electricity company simply
pumped, up the harbour water from one
place for the purpose of cooling its
boilers and then drained it at another,
without adding anything or otherwise
changing the quality of the water. The
harbour water itself was polluted by
effluents from other factories facing
the harbour.
The "stench fish" incident attracted
nationwide publicity and added more
fuel to widespread complaints over
kogai in general by people from other
cities. This led the government to
appoint a special committee to look into
the entire range of kogai effects in
Yokkaichi. The committee submitted a
report and recommendations in March
1964.
National concern was further arous¬
ed by the death in April 1964 of a
63-year-old man, one of the victims
of air pollution in Yokkaichi. By now,
Yokkaichi had become known through¬
out Japan as a "city of kogai", a
reputation which drove it to wrestle
with its problems in deadly earnest,
and at the same time made it an
object lesson from which the central
government and other regions had
much to learn.
Compared with the case of Yokkai¬
chi, the story of Ashio, briefly touched
upon earlier, was technically an ex¬
tremely simple one. It had occurred in
the early stage of Japan's industria¬
lization when the imperative of pro¬
duction took precedence over public
welfare. If the Ashio copper-mining
company had had a modicum of social-
mindedness, it might have taken steps
at a much earlier stage either to reduce
the emission of pollutants or to com¬
pensate for the damage done.
But it comes as something of a
shock to realize that a case quite
similar to the example of Ashio has
occurred in present-day Japan, with the

victims, rather than the offender, again
shouldering the burden of proof. The
case is that of the "Minamata Disease".
Minamata, a small city (pop. 50,000)
on the western coast of Kyushu Island,
is dominated by a single factory owned
by the New Japan Nitrogen Company
which manufactures, among other
chemical products, aceto-aldehyde by
the catalytic hydration of acetylene
with sulphate of mercury.
Early in 1953, reports came from one
part of the city that some cats, dogs
and crows had died in convulsions.
Soon, a number of persons developed
symptoms similar to those of the
stricken animals and on examination
were found to have suffered damage to
the central nervous system.
The death rate was as high as 40 per
cent and the disease was concentrated
among fishermen living in a certain
neighbourhood. No one knew what
had caused this lethal disease, but
medical specialists attacked the prob¬
lem and in November 1956 advanced
the hypothesis that the sickness had
some connexion with a heavy metal,
manganese for example, traces of
which had been found in fish and shell¬
fish in the Bay of Minamata.
But the scientists' investigations
were seriously handicapped by lack of
co-operation from the Nitrogen Com¬
pany, which declared that it had ceased
using manganese in 1953. It refused
either to have the factory drainage
tapped or to supply samples of chem¬
icals used in its production processes.
But research went on and in the
summer of 1959 a new hypothesis was
advanced which connected the disease
with methylmercury. About that time,
though the fact was not known until
much later, a certain Dr. Hosokawa
attached to the Nitrogen Company
hospital confirmed, through experi¬
ments on cats, that the factory drain¬
age wastes contained elements
capable of causing the "Minamata
Disease".
This invaluable research was kept
secret by the Nitrogen Company, but
apparently prompted it to settle the
question of compensation by the pay¬
ment of "condolence money" of
300,000 yen for each person who had
died and an annual award of 100,000
yen for each adult hit by the disease.
Even after the scientists had con¬
firmed the methylmercury hypothesis
they had still to prove that the com¬
pounds of this substance found in fish
and shell-fish had come from the Nitro¬
gen Company's production. This task,
which the Company's lack of co¬
operation had made extremely difficult,
was not made any easier by the atti¬
tude of the government.
The Ministry of International Trade
and Industry called in a specialist from
the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who
maintained that methylmercury was not
the culprit, and the Ministry apparently
made its influence felt in the decision
that was taken to discontinue all
further official investigations into the
Minamata Disease beyond 1959.
But the original group of researchers
continued its studies and, ironically
enough, it was assisted indirectly by
the Nitrogen Company whose decision
to change the drainage site after Sep¬
tember 1958 provided an opportunity
for new and objective experiments.
Observation of the geographical distri¬
bution of new patients and analyses
made near the new and old drainage
sites helped to confirm the earlier sus¬
picions that the methylmecury found in
fish and shell-fish had in fact come
from the factory effluents.
By 1964 practically all the links in
the chain including the process
through which inorganic mercury used
by the Company transformed itself
into organic mercury were scientifi¬
cally established.
Minamata Disease victims numbered
116 by the end of 1969 of whom 45
had died. More than ten of the victims
had apparently been affected during
their fetal development.
The number of new cases has been
drastically reduced since 1960 when
the Nitrogen Company installed a spe¬
cial sewage facility. But the case of
the Minamata Disease lingers on in
the form of litigation currently in the
courts, and also through its outbreak
in another area (the lower stream of
the Agano River in 1964-65) which has
refocused public interest on the dra¬
matic problem of methylmercury poi¬
soning.
One striking aspect of the Minamata
incident is that workers employed by
the Nitrogen Company, though appar¬
ently aware early on of the facts that
the Company was trying to conceal,
did nothing to aid the victims of the
sickness. It was only much later, in
1967, that some of these workers,
writing in their union publication, ad¬
mitted they had been at fault.
Why this happened is a problem that
calls for a close scrutiny of relations
between management and labour in an
enterprise such as the Nitrogen Com¬
pany. All in all, the Minamata incident
poses an extremely interesting social
scientific problem, arising from the im¬
pact of kogai upon the complex net¬
work of social and political relations
in a rural industrial city.
What is now known as cadmium poi¬
soning apparently existed even before
the war in a region along the Jintsu
River and was called "itai-itai disease"
("aching disease") by the local people.
Until the cause of this ailment was
traced to effluents of metal mining, it
was commonly diagnosed as dietic
deficiency and some patients improv¬
ed after taking heavy doses of vita¬
min D.
The symptoms are grinding pains
all over the body, but especially
around the pubic bone, and vulner¬
ability to bone fractures. The disease
was found to have a high incidence
among fecund women. According to

ITAI-ITAI, THE ACHING DISEASE. These twisted hands belong to a
Japanese afflicted by " itai-itai", or "aching disease", an illness with a
50 per cent mortality rate that, in 1946, struck people living on the banks
of the Jintsu River. A zinc factory situated upstream which used cadmium
in its refining processes had poisoned the lower reaches of the river and the
adjoining paddy fields. It was not until 1968 that the government officially
designated "itai-itai " as a pollution disease and thus was in a position to
combat the phenomenon.

Above, not the cracked earth of drought-stricken farmland, but the crust formed by evaporation of deadly liquid
wastes from a nitrogen factory at Minamata, Japan, discharged into a recently constructed purification
reservoir. In 1953, the town of Minamata was struck by a mysterious malady against which doctors were
powerless. Its victims suffered unendurable agony and 45 died. Children were born paralyzed, blind
and deaf. A long inquiry proved that "Minamata disease" was caused by methylmercury used in the
manufacture of nitrogen, then allowed to drain into the sewers and contaminate the water. Recent measures
have considerably reduced the risks, but a vile smell still pervades Minamata. Right, a demonstration by the
people of Minamata who adopted a novel method of bringing pressure to bear on the management of the
nitrogen factory by buying up shares and protesting at company meetings as shareholders. In the foreground

a doctor who has treated 260 cases of
itai-itai since 1946, the death rate is
as high as 50 per cent.
As in the case of the methylmercury
poisoning at Minamata, it was the
patient research of a few private citi¬
zens that identified the cause of the
disease as cadmium contained in
effluents from a zinc-refining factory
on the Jintsu River.
The original hypothesis linking cad¬
mium with the itai-itai disease was
advanced in 1960. The following year
the local government launched a
research programme and in 1963 the
central government, too, decided to
allocate funds for an investigation.
But it was not until 1968 that a
Ministry of Welfare announcement
identified the itai-itai disease as cad¬
mium poisoning and designated it as a
kogai disease. Although the company
concerned did nothing to obstruct the
investigation, the early stage of the
work by several devoted scientists
was given a cold reception, and the
major financial aid at the time came
from the United States.
The connexion between cadmium
and itai-itai is now well known. The
unusually large amounts of cadmium
found in the Jintsu River came from a
zinc-refining plant upstream at Ka-
mioka. The river flows northwards
very rapidly for a stretch of about
15 kilometres along which earth carried
and deposited by the current has
raised the river bed to a higher level
than the rice fields on both sides.
This alluvial fan formation causes
the river to flood almost every year,
carrying dirt and sand containing
cadmium onto the adjoining fields.
This explains why the itai-itai victims
were found only along this stretch of
river and why the local rice habitually
contained an excessive concentration
of cadmium.
All three cases the Yokkaichi
kogai, methylmercury poisoning and
cadmium poisoning are now the
subject of claims for damages in the
courts. In the postwar decades up
to 1967, 35 cases of kogai litigation
have been recorded in Japan, of which
20 were related to noise and vibration,
seven to water pollution, seven to
sunshine amenity and one to offensive
odours. But in none of these cases
did the damage claims amount to
much, and the legal framework in
which they were handled was a tradi¬
tional one in the sense that the gen¬
eral law prescribing damages or
compensation for injury or prejudice
caused was applied.
But the new suits arising from the
three cases already described are
being heard at a time when public
opinion has been increasingly alerted
to the problems of kogai, and thus
give to legal problems a new dimen¬
sion which challenges the adaptability
of present laws to modern industrial
conditions.
In many ways the Yokkaichi suit is
a test case because numerous plain¬
tiffs and defendants are involved and
because the specific link between the
damage suffered by the plaintiffs and
actions of the defendants is practi¬
cally impossible to prove even by the
lenient criterion of "preponderance of
evidence." The court faces a difficult
task of handling a case without a legal
framework pertinent to the purpose.
In 1958, an incident occurred near
Tokyo in which 700 fishermen rioted
against a paper mill whose drainage
was held responsible for damaging
their fishing. The incident, in which
64 policemen were injured, was not a
sudden affair, but the culmination of
a series of negotiations involving the
company, the fishermen's association
and the metropolitan government in
Tokyo, during which the fishermen's pa¬
tience had been strained to the limit.
The incident was settled by the
enforcement of an injunction order on
the company's operation; and some¬
what hurriedly, the same year, the

government enacted two new bills
related to water pollution control the
Water Quality Conservation Act and
the Drainage Regulation Act which
became harbingers of kogai legisla¬
tion in the following decade.
But really serious efforts to draw
up new laws on kogai problems only
began in 1963 when the then Minister
of Welfare, Mr Kobayashi, proposed
an umbrella legislation on pollution
control in general, followed, in 1965,
by the setting up of a government
commission (the Kogai Commission)
to study the problem.
In August 1966, the Commission
submitted an interim report in which
for the. first time in Japan a systematic
philosophy dealing with the kogai
problem was spelled out. Its main
points can be summarized as follows:
In the light of private law, res¬
ponsibility for kogai, in principle, lies
with the persons at the source;
Such responsibility is not affect¬
ed by questions of intention or negli¬
gence;
Costs of prevention and elimina¬
tion of kogai shall be borne by the
persons at its source;
The setting up of a buffer zone
to neutralize the effects of kogai
should be an integral part of urban
planning, and responsibility for such
arrangements including their cost
should be shared by the central
government and by local authorities;
Pollution control should give
higher priority to the quality of the
environment than to the specific
limitation of effluents;
Compensation for damage should
be based on offensive effects that
exceed the normally accepted tol¬
erance limit.
Several representatives of industry
on the Commission strongly opposed
a number of points. But when the
Commission submitted its final report
to the government in October 1966,
the basic philosophy remained more
or less intact and became the basis
for new legislation the Basic law
for Environmental Pollution Control
(Kogai Taisaku Kihon-ho), which was
adopted by the Diet in July 1967.
The Basic Law is a kind of charter
which sets out a general programme
of action but leaves the actual appli¬
cation to specific legislations and
administrative decisions.
The question of spillover effects or
external diseconomies is directly link¬
ed to the kind of institutions found in
a particular economy. Japan's eco¬
nomy is a capitalistic one in which
private firms are the basic autono
mous units. In the early days of
capitalistic development the principle
of "As ye sow, so shall ye reap"
prevailed within the factory bound¬
aries, and any nuisance caused out¬
side those boundaries was considered
"external" in terms of the firm's
financial operations. If and when the
external effect attained proportions
large enough to cause damage to a
third person or the public as a whole,
legal action of one kind or another
was taken.
With the advent of modern techno¬
logy and the tremendously increased
operations of even a single factory,
coupled with urban development,
"external" effects have acquired a
new dimension and it is quite clear
that the old principle of "As ye sow,
so shall ye reap" can no longer be
encompassed within the narrow cost
accounting of an individual firm.
In other words, the social character
of the production process has become
so important that the freedom of
private enterprise can no longer
remain unqualified. Thus a conflict
arises between the traditional arran¬
gement of the Japanese economy and
the consequences of vastly develop¬
ed productive forces, thereby creating
the tensions and problems that have
arisen in the present stage of Japan's
social and economic development.

as "The Smokeless City." Photo left shows

launched an anti-smoke campaign that has had
revolutionary results, as recent photo (right)

i_JN Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
these days, it is possible to wear a
white shirt, or a white dress, from
dawn to dusk and come home almost
spotless. Housewives are able to hang
out the wash on a sunny morning
without having the load to do again
by noon because of sootfall and dust.
Most of the downtown skyscrapers
appear newly constructed, though it
has been several years since the
surfaces were washed or blasted.
Before the 1940s, however, gen¬
erations lived in Pittsburgh once
known as the Smoky City that often
found it difficult to see the opposite
side of the street. Today Pittsburgh,
the once murky steel-town, is visually
one of America's cleaner cities.
Pittsburgh has reduced its smoke
and dustfall by an amazing 84 per
cent since World War II. Visibility
from downtown is now about 10 miles
compared to the former blackout
conditions. Today the pollution trend
is reversed and invisible gases, such
as carbon monoxide and sulphur
dioxide, from the automobile and fuel
combustion, now comprise about 90 per
cent of the pollution concern for
control officials.
The key to success came through
co-operative community action. To
understand the enormity of the job
that faced Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County when they launched their
smoke abatement efforts let us glance
at the major smoke-producing factors
then prevalent:
1,600,000 persons resided in 500,000
households, most of which burned soft
coal.
A vast complex of 1,600 industrial
and commercial installations existed in
the area. This complex included the
steel-making and processing facilities
of major companies: over 150 furnaces,
cement mills, coke plants, brick kilns,
coal mines, paint factories, chemical
works and oil refineries.

up a steady traffic through Allegheny
County.
It was a task to discourage any
but those of stout heart. But the
community rose to the challenge in
an orderly, efficient campaign; not the
pellmell irresponsible drive that panic
begets.
Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had
to call upon every element of the com¬
munity for co-operative effort, and they
got it without any financial help from
the government.
In this campaign, help came from
many sources:
Householders volunteered either
to abandon the use of soft coal or to
install smoke preventative fuel-
burners.
Industry volunteered the expen¬
diture of tremendous sums to greatly
reduce or eliminate smoke emissions
from its stacks.
Railroads and shipping lines volun¬
teered to shift from steam to diesel-
powered operations.
Coal mines volunteered to bring
under control fires in gob (waste
material) piles.
The total investment in fuel change¬
over, installation of cleaning devices
and process changes to clean the air
since World War II has amounted to
the gigantic sum of over $380,000,000.
It cost home-owners about 25 per cent
of this amount and industry the re¬
maining 75 per cent.
Another vital factor leading to the
success of the campaign was that
industry not only assigned its
engineering personnel to develop new
devices to control smoke emissions
in its own plant, but provided joint
engineering know-how through re¬
search on smoke control problems.
As technological solutions were found,
this knowledge was shared by com¬
petitors.
The important discoveries were not
only of benefit to the community, but
to the entire United States, and were
especially helpful in writing in air pol¬
lution control device specifications as
new plants were being designed or
built.
The fight for clean air really began
late in 1939, but it was seven grimy
years before any specific results could
be seen.
Leading industrial and business
executives, including representatives
of the steel industry, sparked the
renaissance through formation of the
Allegheny Conference on Community
Development. By 1942 another civic
group, the United Smoke Council, was
formed by 142 men and women from
71 organizations. In 1945, the United
Smoke Council became a part of the
Committee on Smoke Abatement, a
subdivision of the Allegheny Conferen¬
ce on Community Development.
But something else took place in
1945 that dramatized the struggle for
clean air so prominently that most of
Pittsburgh's population had to take
sides. David L. Lawrence, an inde¬
pendent and well-to-do industrialist,
campaigned for the nomination for
mayor, and his major appeal was to
those who wanted smoke control.
Not everyone wanted smoke control
by any means. Householders were
told that smokeless fuel would cost
them dearly and that smoke control
would drive industry from Pittsburgh;
that it would become a jobless ghost
town if the Lawrence supporters had
their way.
It was a tough battle, but Lawrence
won the nomination and the election.
And he proved to be a man who kept
his campaign promises, particularly
where smoke control was concerned.
"If I had to choose, I would rather
One key to Lawrence's campaign
was an impressive fact sheet about the
high cost of atmospheric pollution.
Respected physicians said that Pitts¬
burgh was not a healthy place to live
in, and statistics on respiratory
diseases appeared to bear them out
(in 1945, for example, Pittsburgh led
the nation in deaths from pneumonia).
It was disclosed that forty industrial
firms had decided to leave Pittsburgh
because of smoke, smog, and impure
air, as well as a recurring danger
from floods and contaminated water.
Actually it was in 1941 that Pitts¬
burgh embarked on its cleaner air
quest. It passed, with wide civic and
industrial support, an ordinance with
more than adequate teeth, but World
War II prevented enforcement.
On October 1, 1946, the smoke
abatement ordinance was put into
force. Regulations severely restricting
smoke emissions by industrial plants
and railroads, took effect immediately
while family dwellings were given a
year of grace to comply.
In 1946, the Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce, the League of Women
Voters, and other civic groups joined

the Allegheny Conference fight to
extend air-pollution efforts to all of
Allegheny County. Pittsburgh had
discovered what many other regions
have still failed to grasp: that polluted
air knows no political boundaries; it
drifts over borders and chokes com¬
munities impartially.
Within two years the city had gain¬
ed some of the benefits of air pollution
control. Two years after its smoke
control ordinance went into effect,
visibility in downtown Pittsburgh had
improved 67 per cent and there was
a 39 per cent improvement in days of
sunshine observable. The pall of
smoke was thinning out.
In May, 1949, after one of the finest
displays of community dedication and
with all the segments closing ranks
industry, labour, business and civic
groups, educators, the press and
householders the Allegheny County
smoke control' ordinance was passed
by the Board of County Commis¬
sioners. This regulation was to last
until 1960 when it was revised.
The law was drafted, it should be
emphasized, with the participation
of those who for the most part would
be the first to be hit by its demanding
provisions.
General public acceptance of the
stringency of the smoke abatement
provisions was made considerably
easier by the educational campaign
carried on while the ordinance was
being drafted. In this endeavour the
entire press in the area did yeoman
service.
The community, of course, was con¬
ditioned to the realization that no mira¬
culous "instant" results could be ex¬
pected. It was prepared for a long
pull and in this it was pleasantly sur¬
prised, for after a single year of enfor¬
cement some rather remarkable pro¬
gress had been achieved.
And so it went. Each succeeding
annual report brought good tidings.
Within a very few years there was no
longer a need to wait for progress
reports. The evidence was all around,
for all the populace to see.
Those who knew Pittsburgh "when",
could hardly believe their eyes on
re-visits. By 1955, there was a reduc¬
tion of 96.6 per cent in heavy smoke
and of 88.8 per cent in total smoke
since 1946. The annual estimated per
sonal savings amounted to $41 mil¬
lions in laundry and cleaning bills as
soot no longer descended on lines and
curtains.
On top of all its other virtues, the
smoke abatement campaign is gen¬
erally credited with a major role in
sparking Pittsburgh's mammoth rebuild¬
ing programme that changed the face
of the city.
Although improvement piled on im¬
provement, Pittsburgh and Allegheny
County refused to rest on their laurels.
They went after bigger air pollution
game. Up to that point they had
directed their attack to smoke abate¬
ment. Now they were determined to
tackle the emissions from open-hearth
furnaces, sintering plants and electric
furnaces which had been omitted from
the first ordinance because there was
no known way to control their emis¬
sions. The new Advisory Committee
was assigned the job of drafting a new
ordinance, one that would deal with
these emissions, and other pollutants.
This situation was not without irony,
since it was the successful result of
research by the very steel companies
which would be affected by the new
regulations that led to the decision to
put stringent emission limitations into
law.
Though the composition of the
1949 County Advisory Committee had
changed, its dedication to the public
interest was as unswerving as that of
the original group.
In March 1960, the Committee
drafted an ordinance that imposed
new stringent regulations described
as the strictest ever invoked against
air pollution.
A quick look at some current statis¬
tics provides astonishing proof of the
long road that Pittsburgh and Alleghe¬
ny County have travelled on their
march into the bright new era of
cleaner air which was shaped through
co-operative community effort.
In 1940 there were 1,000 hours
when downtown visibility was less
than 3/4 miles. By 1960 this was
reduced to under 75 hours per year.
By 1970 visibility had been extended
beyond 10 miles on most days.
The crowning touch to the measur¬
ement of Pittsburgh's present high
state as a centre for cleaner skies,
came in a U.S. Public Health Service
survey in 1962, which disclosed that
Pittsburgh had less fine dust per
square mile than nine of the 11 cities
tested. The only city that was below
Pittsburgh was Salt Lake City.
As a result of control efforts to
date, the air in downtown Pittsburgh
is visibly clean. However, Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County are fully aware
that their battle against air pollution can
never be completely won; none ever
is.
But the citizens are prepared to .t «j
continue their anti-pollution campaign I /
with unrelenting vigour, secure in the
knowledge that they can depend on
community action.

The 'pollution' fight
before the U.S. courts
D
%J URGEONING public con¬
cern in the United States about envi¬
ronmental quality has, inevitably, had
its impact on the legal system. Laws
are being enacted setting quality
standards, appropriating money to
purchase park lands, subsidizing treat¬
ment of pollution, and creating new
government regulatory agencies. It is
even being recommended by a number
of serious legislators that the U.S.
Federal Constitution be amended to
add a provision guaranteeing to the
people an inalienable right to a decent
environment.
In all the stir of legislative and
political activity, insufficient attention
may be given to the courts, where very
significant developments are taking
place. Environmental problems are
not a novelty in American courtrooms.
Judges have traditionally abated pollu¬
tion as a nuisance, at the behest of
nearby property owners; and it is quite
common for government agencies to
obtain judicial enforcement of their
orders regulating the use of land,
water and air.
During the last few years, however,
a rather novel kind of court action has
been developing which has important
implications not only for legal institu¬
tions, but for our whole way of think¬

These new lawsuits are particularly
characterized by three facts: First, the
plaintiffs are private citizens, not public
agencies. Second, they sue not as
property owners nor as protectors of
any conventional private interest, but
as members of the general public
asserting rights they claim simply as
members of the public. And finally,
the defendants in these cases are
frequently the very governmental
agencies which are themselves sup¬
posed to be protecting the public
interest.
Such cases arise in many contexts.

way department to challenge the loca¬
tion of a new road; or against a
pollution control agency on the ground
that it is not enforcing the law ade¬
quately. A private industry or utility
company may be sued to enjoin its
plans for locating a new plant or
transmission line right of way.
The subject matter of such cases
covers the whole range of environ¬
mental issues, from urban air pollution
to wilderness management in the high
country, from drilling oil under the sea
to the location and operations of air¬
ports.
The real significance of such cases,
however, lies in the disillusionment
they betoken with the efforts and
accomplishments of government agen¬
cies which are supposed to be protect¬
ing the quality of the environment.
For in every situation where lawsuits
such as those just described are
instituted, there is almost always at
least one government agency which
is officially charged with preventing
unreasonable environmental disruption.
Such lawsuits are thus indicators of a
citizens' revolt against official protec¬
tors of the publjc interest.
In the past, reliance on professional
regulators went so far that private
citizens were excluded even from the
opportunity to participate in the
process; a whole panoply of legal
rules held that the job of protecting
the public interest was to be left
exclusively to governmental adminis¬
trators. When a citizen did try to
intervene, he was promptly excluded
as an interloper, a busybody who
should leave the job of regulation to
the experts.
In the last few years, however, these
restraints have begun to fall away;
even the most traditional-minded
judges have come to recognize that
the private citizen has a legitimate, and
at times essential, role to play in the
determination and implementation of
the public interest.
The following quotation is taken from
an opinion of the present Chief Justice
of the United States, Warren Burger.
The case itself involved an application
for a renewal of its licence by a radio
station. Local citizens and organiza¬
tions sought to intervene in the
proceeding to object to the renewal,
and the regulatory agency which
handles such matters attempted to
exclude the citizens as meddlers.
To this Judge Burger replied:
"The theory that the Commission
can always effectively represent the
listener interests . . . without the aid
and participation of legitimate listener
representatives fulfilling the role of
private attorneys-general is one of
those assumptions we collectively try
to work with so long as they are
reasonably adequate.
"When it becomes clear . . . that it
is no longer a valid assumption which
stands up under the realities of actual
experience, neither we nor the Com¬
mission can continue to rely on it . . .
"We cannot fail to note that the
long history of complaints . . . had left
the Commission virtually unmoved . . .
the renewal application might well
have been routinely granted except
for the determined and sustained
efforts of the complaining citizens: at
no small expense to themselves."

_ ADMINISTRATIVE agencies
recoil in shock at the prospect of being
taken to court by "mere" citizens.
They will be subject to delay, they say,
to interference with long established
plans, and will have to spend valu¬
able time justifying themselves in a
courtroom. Litigation is indeed incon¬
venient for them; but it is at the same
time very revealing.
Why, for example, do administrative
orders against air and water pollution
so often go unenforced for years?
Why do public agencies dispose of
valuable wetlands for filling by
housing developers, when other less
ecologically significant uplands are
available? Why do road building
agencies so often w.-int to take park
lands and preserves for their high¬
ways? How do industries get permis¬
sion to take risks which lead to occur¬
rences such as the deplorable oil
leakage at Santa Barbara, California ?
The answer, often, is that regulatory
agencies see these issues from a
peculiar perspective all their own. The
decision to lease submerged lands for
oil drilling off the California coast at
Santa Barbara illustrates this problem

in a most instructive manner. When
the question was raised whether fed¬
eral lands should be leased, local
citizens despite the great difficulty
of obtaining information were most
dubious about the project.
As to the problem of spillage, as
one Santa Barbara official later recall¬
ed, the problem "was discussed many
times, but always Interior Department
and oil industry officials led us to be¬
lieve we had nothing to fear. They
said they had perfected shutoff de¬
vices that were foolproof even in such
disasters as a ship running into the
platform or an earthquake."
Later events at Santa Barbara dem¬
onstrated just how misplaced that
confidence was. The distressing part
of the story, however, is not merely
that those who ought to have known
better were wrong but rather that
every effort to open such issues in
inquiry was brushed aside or ridiculed
because other more powerful forces
had already predetermined the leasing
question.
When questions were raised about
the proposal by concerned citizens,
federal officials replied publicly with
a letter saying "we feel maximum pro¬
vision has been made for the local
environment and that further delay in
lease sale would not be consistent
with the national interest."
Privately, though, an interagency
memorandum was circulated comment¬
ing that "the 'heat' has not died down
but we can keep trying to alleviate
the fears of the people" and noting
that pressures were being applied by
the oil companies whose equipment
"costing millions of dollars" was being
held "in anticipation."
The eagerness of Interior Depart¬
ment officials to get the leasing over
with quickly and quietly was made
clear in a memorandum written when it
was learned that another federal
agency was considering holding public
hearings at Santa Barbara prior to the
leasing. Here is the text of an Interior
Department memorandum circulated
privately in response to that sugges¬
tion:

interest' aspects in our offshore opera¬

Of course, how they handled the pub¬
lic was their business, but we did not
have to participate... I pointed out that
we had chosen not to go the public
hearing route... That we had tried to
warn the... District Engineer of the
Corps what he faced and we preferred
not to stir the natives up any more
than possible."
The reason for the eagerness of the
Interior Department to go forward with
the leasing was made quite clear later,
after the oil spill, when responsible
officials were called upon to testify
about the decision.
The former Secretary of the Interior
explained it all quite succinctly. The
Bureau of the Budget was "hungry
for revenue" and "a Presidential deci¬
sion had been made about getting
more money to help balance the nation¬
al budget... Communications from the
budget bureau were indicating to us
that we should have a maximum leas¬
ing programme."
N

O doubt these consider¬
ations were reason enough to per¬
suade the Interior Department. And
from their perspective, the choice could
hardly have been different. It is not
the Secretary of the Interior's job to
undermine the President's program¬
mes; he is as we are so often told a
member of the President's team. The
question, however, is who was repre¬
senting the interests of the citizens of
Santa Barbara and of the general pu¬
blic who have a stake in that environ¬
ment?
The Santa Barbara case is not un¬
usual; indeed it is typical of a most
pervasive and central fact about the
administrative process. Regulatory
agencies have an interest and pers¬
pective of their own which is frequent¬
ly at odds with that of significant seg¬
ments of the public whose interest the
agency is supposed to be protecting.
These difficulties are not unique to
the problems of the environment, but
they are being most dramatically illus¬
trated in this area because environ¬
mental problems pre-eminently reflect
the demand that the governmental pro¬
cess bring a variety of perspectives to
bear upon the resolution of problems.
Thus, the elements which peculiarly
characterize the administrative pro¬
cess narrow technical expertise, ma¬
nagerial rather than policy orientation,
historical association with particular
interests, and concern for its own bud¬
get and its own programmes tend to
lock it into a limited "inside perspect¬
ive." We need to provide a fresh
point of view, an outside perspective.
In a recent case, for example,
private citizens challenged a govern¬
ment sale of timber on national forest
lands to a private lumber company.
The plaintiffs alleged that the area in
question should have been reserved
as an addition to the national wilder¬
ness system.
The defendant U.S. Forest Service
was adamant in insisting that the tract
be committed to timber harvesting
and was unwilling to delay its decision,
until the U.S. Congress would within
the next year have a chance to
review the entire area to deter¬
mine whether a nearby wilderness
area should be enlarged to include this
tract.
Local citizens brought suit in fed¬
eral court, and the judge asked the
questions which any reasonable out¬
sider would find a matter of puzzle¬
ment. What was the hurry about
cutting in this area, end why could
there not be a delay until congres¬
sional review was completed?
The case went to trial and it was
revealed that the original decision to
harvest timber on this tract had been
made as early as 1962, several years
before the wilderness system was even'
created by legislation. In pursuance
of this decision also before the wil¬
derness law came into force the
Forest Service had built a road into the
area. Roads of this kind are neces¬
sary for timber harvesting.
Once the investment in a road had
been made, the Forest Service was
essentially locked into the decision to
harvest timber there. Other areas
nearby, not alleged by anyone to be
suitable for wilderness designation,
were appropriate for timber harvesting,
but there was no road built elsewhere
and the Forest Service was obviously
reluctant to "waste" a road it had al¬
ready built.
Citizens have been turning increas¬
ingly to the courts because the judicia¬
ry offers an opportunity to bring a fresh
and uncommitted perspective, an out¬
sider's perspective, to environmental
problems; and judges are asking ques¬
tions which all too often are not asked
by the agencies charged with the rou¬
tine job of regulation.
Why wouldn't it have been reason¬
able to wait a little longer, until Con¬
gress had a chance to look at this area
as wilderness, before depriving it of
asserted wilderness qualities by cut¬
ting the timber? Why was it necessary
to take park land for this highway
interchange? Why is an air or water
pollution control order not being more
rigorously enforced?
Plainly the rise of citizen-initiated
litigation is not attributable to any
belief that judges are wiser than other
officials, or that they should finally
determine our environmental policies.
Rather, litigation represents an attempt
to bring concerned citizens into the
decision-making process by opening a
forum in which there is relative equa¬
lity of access and an opportunity to
get issues out into the open where
they can be considered on merit.
Frequently, the relief sought from the
courts is in essence a "remand" to the
legislative process so that controver¬
sial decisions, and unresolved conflicts
of policy, can be put openly before
elected representatives for decision.
This technique is pointedly illustrated
by a series of recent cases which have
arisen in the state of Massachusetts.
Citizens challenged the highway
department's decision to take park land
for its own use, and the court noted
a disturbing insensitivity on the part of
the highway agency to the state's con¬
cern for the maintenance of public
parks. The defendant highway depart¬
ment claimed it had ample authority
under a broad statute which autho¬
rized it to "improve" the lands of the
commonwealth; thus, it said, it could
take park land at will, and its decision
to do so must be respected by the
judiciary.
This was too much for the Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts.
Plainly annoyed by such arrogance,
the court responded:
"...the improvement of public lands
contemplated by this section does not
include the widening of a State high¬
way. It seems rather that the improve¬
ment of public lands which the legis¬
lature provided for... is to preserve
such lands so that they may be enjoy¬
ed by the public for recreational pur¬
poses."
T
HE court held that before
the highway department could take
park land it had to go to the legislature
and obtain specific authorization.
The goal was to deprive the highway
agency of ultimate authority over the
policy question involved and to force
the legislature openly to consider and
resolve the issue presented by the
suit. Technically, the court ruled that
the highway department lacked ade¬
quate authority to seize park land at
will. Essentially however the purpose
of the lawsuit was to put the issue
before the legislature where it would
have to be confronted and resolved in
the full light of public attention.
The court thus ruled:
"It is essential to the expression of
plain and explicit authority to divert
park lands. . . to new and inconsistent
uses that there appear in the legis¬
lation not only a statement of the new
use but also a statement or recital
showing in some way legislative
awareness of the existing public use.
In short, the legislation should express
]]>

not merely the public will for the new
use but its willingness to surrender or
forego the existing use."
It is with holdings such as this that
courts respond to citizen pressures to
democratize the decision-making pro¬
cess as it affects issues of environ¬
mental quality.
To be sure, such litigation does not
assure that the advocates of any given
position will triumph, or that the legis¬
lature will necessarily produce a wise
resolution. It does, however, help
to move questionable environmental
decision-making into a forum where
issues of policy must be made and
articulated openly, and where legisla¬
tors must assess the political conse¬
quences of one position or another.
Measured against a system which
has been characterized by its respon¬
siveness to particular and limited pers¬
pectives, and by its penchant for quiet
resolution of potential conflict (often
revealed in the attitude that the less
the public knows, the less trouble there
will be), judicial intervention of the
type described above is a significant
step forward.
In an area such as environmental
quality, where we struggle so much to
determine what our goals should be,
it is instructive to recall from time to
time the enormous difficulties encoun¬
tered in getting public agencies to res¬
pond to those situations in which there
is a substantial consensus about goals;
and in which narrow interest groups
have learned to manipulate the
governmental process to their own
advantage, to the dismay and detri¬
ment of the dominant community. All
too often the public is simply presented
with a fait accompli.
Plainly the deep problems of environ¬
mental quality go beyond the ability of
any court to manage within the con¬
fines of a particular case. No court
decision will resolve the issues of
population, of the automobile versus
intelligent mass transit, or the trend
toward uncontained economic growth.
What judicial decisions do, however,
is to bring home the costs which these
problems impose as they come to rest
upon particular communities in spe¬
cific contexts. The difficulties we have
in pricing and managing external
effects take on sharply visible con¬
tours when a highway location is chal¬
lenged in each town through which it
passes, or when a polluting industry is
challenged to justify its conduct.
Each such case, then, thrusts back
upon the policymakers the requirement
that they face up to the cumulative
effects of their decisions, and gives
those upon whom such external costs
are imposed a chance to put a price
tag on them in terms of their own dis¬
comfort and inconvenience.
We are asked to have faith that
%
Jl
administrative agencies will cure them¬
selves of their traditional narrowness,
and hope that legislative mandates
ordering them to undertake broader
perspectives will bring significant
changes. Perhaps these changes will
occur; thus far the process has been
so slow as to be almost imperceptible.
We have a great deal of rethinking
to do about our laissez-faire attitudes

and assumptions about the process of
government. It may seem ironic that
courts are needed to help make the
legislative process work effectively;
that citizens must come to the least
democratic of the branches of govern¬
ment to make democracy work. But
that is one of the intriguing questions
now being explored under the label of
environmental litigation.

Environmental control
and economic systems
L
24
IKE the many-headed Hy¬
dra of Greek legend, pollution seems
to grow two new heads for every one
we succeed in striking off. When the
newly invented flush toilet was intro¬
duced in London and night soil began
to disappear from the streets of the
city, deaths from typhoid soared as
sewage was flushed straight into the
drinking water supplies.
This early lesson in the futility of
tinkering with the symptoms of pollu¬
tion instead of tackling the problem at
its roots went long unheeded; pollution
remained a technical problem for which
technology was blamed and for which
the scientist was expected to find an
answer.
But like control of nuclear power,
of telecommunications satellites, of
the potent forces of modern chem¬
istry, controlling pollution is a social
problem and at the Symposium on
Environmental Disruption organized
by the International Social Science
Council, in Tokyo last year, some lead¬
ing social scientists showed that they
were ready to assume their responsi¬
bilities.
Getting down to the social roots of
the problem, in perhaps the most inte¬
resting of their discussions, they debat¬
ed environmental disruption and its
control, in relation to different econo¬
mic systems.
Professor Erik Dahmen, of the
Stockholm School of Economics, went
straight to the heart of the problem.
To the question "Has the pace of en¬
vironmental disruption been different
under differing economic systems?" he
gave an unequivocal answer.
"A general survey of conditions in
different countries", said Professor
Dahmen, "leads to an unambiguous
conclusion: Differences in the degree
of environmental disruption exist be¬
tween countries of different levels of
development, with different population
densities, different degrees of urbani¬
zation, different geographical condi¬
tions and different climates. But there
is no evidence whatever that different
economic systems are of any impor¬
tance in this connexion, and state-
owned companies are no different
from privately-owned companies in
the extent to which they damage the
environment."
This did not mean, Professor Dah¬
men pointed out, that it might not be
easier to check environmental disrup¬
tion under one system than under
another.
Environmental disruption was caus¬
ed by a combination of factors such
as technological and industrial pro¬
gress, urbanization and population
development, with geographical condi¬
tions and climate as contributory
factors.
It was, however, an "organizational
factor", Professor Dahmen suggested,
that played a determining role in
encouraging pollution. In the complex
industrial world of today, with its
highly advanced division of labour,
different stages of decision-making
corresponded to different stages in the
production process, and this was true
of both main types of economic
systems.
In socialist systems, central autho¬
rities usually set the production
goals and decided on financing and
on the distribution of resources, but
producers were often at liberty to
take decisions regarding technological
matters that could have a direct effect
upon the environment, not unlike their
counterparts in non-socialist countries.
Control of pollution could be
attempted, Professor Dahmen maintain¬
ed, either by the imposition of regu¬
lations or by evaluating the hitherto
ignored socio-economic costs and
charging them to the producers
concerned. It was likely, he believed,
that regulations would be more
effective under a socialist system and
a fee method under free enterprise.
P,
ROFESSOR Marshall Gold¬
man, of the Department of Economics
of Wellesley College, Massachusetts,
in the U.S.A., viewed pollution as a
world-wide phenomenon, existing not
only in the western world but also in
the U.S.S.R. and other socialist
countries. This he found surprising
since, as he put it, "In theory, environ¬
mental disruption is usually regarded
as a function of selfish private en¬
terprise where the public good and
social costs are ignored".
Whatever the theoretical implications
of how socialism should be able to
avoid environmental disruption, the
Soviet Union, said Professor Goldman,
was as puzzled as the rest of us that
their pollution problems should be so
great. He quoted the editor of the
Soviet magazine Soviet Life as
asking, "Why, in a socialist country
whose constitution explicitly says that
the public interest may not be ignored,
are industry executives permitted to
break the laws protecting nature?"
Massive fish kills had been reported
in the Soviet press in the Gulf of
Finland, the Caspian Sea, and the
Volga and Don rivers. Oil disposal,
said Professor Goldman, was another
problem. Until 1965, the oil refineries
at Baku had no sewage treatment
facilities and waste oil was pumped
directly into the Caspian Sea; oil tank¬
ers were in the habit of discharging
their ballast overboard. Harbour treat¬
ment plants, however, have now been
built and it is claimed that 40 per cent
of the oil waste flowing into the Cas¬
pian is now cleaned up. Nevertheless,
complaints were still made according
to the Bakinskii Rabochi about the in¬
effectiveness of the new treatment
plants.
"Naturae enim non imperatur, nisi
parendo" (we cannot control nature
except by obeying her) wrote Francis
Bacon, and the huge system of dams,
reservoirs and irrigation canals built
in the Soviet Union, though bringing
multiple benefits to thousands of
people, had led to the diversion of
so much water that there is now
serious concern for the future of the
Caspian and the Aral Seas.
The level of the Caspian had
dropped 2\ metres over the past
20 years, reducing the spawning areas
for sturgeon by about one third,
reported the Ekonomicheskaia Ga-
zeta. Between 1961 and 1969 the
level of the Aral Sea dropped more
than 1£ metres which suggested that,
if this rate of shrinkage was maintain¬
ed, by the year 2030 the Sea would
be little more than a vast salt marsh.
Paralleling the pollution problems
of the Great Lakes of North America,
Professor Goldman declared, were
those now affecting Lake Baikal,
which contains the largest volume of

fresh water of any lake in the world.
Despite widespread protests that in¬
dustrialization near the lake would
destroy the quality of its water, two
paper mills were built and plans for
additional mills had been discussed.
The danger had been recognized
and stringent controls imposed on the
mill at Baikalsk and production tem¬
porarily halted at the other mill.
Despite these precautions, reported
Pravda, the Limnological Institute of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences had
estimated that the number of plants
and animals in the zone where sewage
from the Baikalsk plant was discharged
had decreased by between one half
and one third.
The cutting of trees to supply the
mills also contributed to erosion
problems causing silt to flow into the
lake. The Director of the Limnological
Institute, Gregory Galazi, had pointed
out that the whole taiga region might
be affected.
I
IT was pointed out by
Professor T. Shibata, of Tokyo
Metropolitan University, that an
examination of environmental dis¬
ruption in Japan, for example, would
certainly produce a far more formid¬
able list of problems than those facing
the U.S.S.R. and he asked Professor
Goldman whether' he could identify
any particular built-in mechanism in a
socialist society which tended to
cause proliferation of environmental
disruption.
Professor Goldman replied that, just
as many examples of environmental
disruption in the Soviet Union could
be duplicated in almost any other
industrialized country, so many of the
explanations for them were similar.
As in many non-socialist countries,
anti-pollution regulations were not
always obeyed in the U.S.S.R. At Lake
Baikal, for example, the paper plants
had at first found it cheaper to pay
the fines than to improve machinery
or close down altogether.
It had often been assumed that this
kind of thing could not happen in a
socialist economy and that each
government-owned factory would in-

Ukraine's nation-wide movement
to protect its natural resources
Three years ago, the
Council of Ministers of
the Republic of the
Ukraine set up a State
Committee for the
Protection of Nature.
In the following
interview, Mr Boris
Voltovski, chairman of
the committee, describes
some of the special
problems of
environmental
disruption in the
Ukraine and the
measures being taken
to meet them.
QUESTION. Mr. Voltovski, would
you tell us something about the back¬
ground problems which led to the sett¬
ing up of your committee?
ANSWER. The problems of the
protection of nature are no longer
merely national; they have become
international and, in a sense, universal
in scope. They are now an important
factor in relations between states and
in many countries they have even
become a national political issue. The
dimension of the problem was clearly
demonstrated at the Unesco-sponsored
international conference on Man and
the Biosphere, held in Paris in Sep¬
tember 1968, in which the U.S.S.R. and
the Republic of the Ukraine partici¬
pated. (See the "Unesco Courier",
January 1969, Editor.) This confer¬
ence was devoted to problems of the
biosphere and the use of the world's
natural resources. Over the past few
years many similar conferences, sym¬
posia and congresses have been held
all over the world.
The "triumphant march" of civilization
has inflicted considerable damage on
nature, and the dynamic expansion of
industry with the uncontrolled exploi¬
tation of the earth's natural resources
has led to the pollution of water and
the atmosphere. Erosion and the felling
of forests have been contributory
factors in the spoliation of larger and
larger areas of once fertile land.
Dozens of species of animals are
threatened with extinction. With the
present rate of expansion of the world's
fishing fleets, scientists are becoming
pessimistic about the future of the
once seemingly inexhaustible supply
of fish in the oceans.
All these factors, coupled with the
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL (Continued from page 25)

elude in its price an amount equal to
the social costs it was responsible for.
Yet while the Soviet accounting system
of "Khozraschet" did involve charging
for the direct cost of factors used,
Soviet accountants had not been
more successful than anyone else in
making explicit the social costs arising
from an enterprise's activities and
including them in the cost of pro¬
duction.
Though many environmental prob¬
lems were common to both socialist
and non-socialist countries, certain
others were peculiar to an economic
society like the Soviet Union in which
a heavy premium was placed on
continued investment for future growth
and there was a reluctance to divert
funds from productive to non-pro¬
ductive uses. Unfortunately, expen¬
diture on pollution control tended to
be non-productive.
On the other hand, Professor Gold¬
man pointed out, there were a number
of ways in which the Soviet system
was better able to cope with or
prevent pollution problems. Because
government agencies owned the util¬
ities as well as most of the buildings,
it was relatively easy in the Soviet
Union to take advantage of economies
of scale in dealing with environmental
disruption. In most large cities in the
Soviet Union heat and hot water were
supplied to entire neighbourhoods by
the Teplovaia Elektro Tsentral, or
"TETs".
In densely populated urban areas
this eliminated the need for each
building to have its own furnace and
hot water heater. Fifty per cent of
all heat consumption was provided
centrally in the U.S.S.R. The instal¬
lation of such a system in the town
of Alma Ata had made it possible to
eliminate 436 individual building fur¬
naces and boilers.
The enormous power of the State
in the U.S.S.R. could also be an
advantage. The State could decree
the establishment of a natural reserve
without going through the expensive
and time-consuming process of com¬
pensating private property owners that
was necessary in the U.S.A.
"Industrialization, and not private
enterprise", Professor Goldman declar¬
ed, "is the primary cause of environ¬
mental disruption. The question re¬
mains, can you have industrialization
without environmental disruption in any
society? Since the answer seems to
be no, it should come as no surprise
that, despite the differences in eco¬
nomic systems, the solutions to en¬
vironmental disruption in the U.S.S.R.
are no simpler than they are in U.S.A.".
Professor V. S. Semenov, of the
Moscow Institute of Philosophy, ex¬
pressed sharp disagreement with
Professor Goldman's conclusion that
industrialization and not free enterprise
was the villain of the piece, nor was
he convinced by Professor Dahmen's
earlier statement that there was no
evidence that different economic sys¬
tems were of any importance in con¬
nexion with environmental disruption.
He maintained that a socialist state
could spell out the objectives of social
action according to the specific stage
of development of that society and
concentrate all the social forces and
resources in accordance with prior¬
ities indicated by scientific planning.
"New, non-damaging production meth¬
ods and products could be developed
much more easily under socialism
once that objective was defined."
The fundamental point, said Profes¬

lic character of ownership under so¬
cialism thanks to which, for example,
even a step to close down particular
factories could be taken, when nega¬
tive effects became too blatant, with¬
out in any way victimizing the workers
and the managers concerned.
Referring to problems of environ¬
ment and scientific city planning, Pro¬

statistics about the rate of urban
growth in the fifty odd years of de¬
velopment in the U.S.S.R.

population explosion, fully justify the
special consideration now being given
to the problems of the protection of
nature.
Q. How is the Ukraine itself
affected by these problems?
A. In the Ukraine, and indeed
throughout the U.S.S.R., the prob¬
lem of air and water pollution has not
reached the same critical stage as in
certain European countries. It does,
however, exist and the Soviet govern¬
ment is taking energetic steps to
reduce it.
The State Committee for the protec¬
tion of nature, of which I am chairman,
was set up three years ago under the
Council of Ministers of the Republic
of the Ukraine. Its title clearly indi¬
cates its responsibilities. But it would
be a mistake to think that nothing was
being done in this field before. The
committee has, however, made it pos¬
sible to co-ordinate all the major under¬
takings aimed at the protection of
nature.
Q. Can you give us further details
of the measures being taken in the
Ukraine?
A. In both Ukrainian and Russian,
the word "land" is often synonymous
with "soil". This conceals a deeper
truth since human life and agricultural
production are dependent upon the
earth's outer layer. Over 10 per cent
of the land surface of the globe is
under cultivation. In the Ukraine the
proportion is much higher 67 per
cent, as against 41.5 per cent in
France, 32.5 per cent in the German
Democratic Republic and the Federal
Republic of Germany, and 26.5 per
cent in the United States. We have,
therefore, to be discriminating in our
use of arable land. In the Ukraine we
are concentrating our efforts on con¬
trolling erosion by wind and water.
Q. Has erosion caused much
damage in the Ukraine?
A. Erosion is a catastrophe. The
French scientist Alexis Guérin has esti¬
mated that during the past century
wind and water erosion has destroyed
nearly 5,000 million acres (15 per cent)
of the land surface of the globe, repre¬
senting 27 per cent of the land in active
agricultural use.
In the Ukraine, erosion has put
31 million acres of land out of commis¬
sion a very substantial loss to agri¬
culture. The Republic is making a great
effort in the struggle against erosion.
In the Ukraine, widespread use is
made of forest screens which protect
the soil from the ravages of the wind,

population; by 1968 this proportion
had risen to 56 per cent. A total of
934 new cities came into existence
between 1926 and 1969; each decade
following 1917 was the equivalent of
more than a century of pre-Revolution
development in respect of new cities.
Population growth had been equally
startling, he said. In 1926 there were
only three cities in the U.S.S.R. with
populations of 500,000 or more; in
1969, there were 34 such cities.
Practically speaking, a modern urban
environment has been created in the
U.S.S.R. in the space of fifty years,
during which period 113,400,000 people
have become city-dwellers.
"Working and everyday conditions",
said Professor Semenov, "are the two
main components of the city environ¬
ment. The conditions under which a
city-dweller lives depend upon the
rational organization and harmonious
development of these two aspects of
his life."
The imbalance in the development
of industrial and everyday aspects of
urban life which existed during the
period of industrialization before the
outbreak of the last war had begun
to decrease during the past few
decades with the all-round develop¬
ment of Soviet cities. Resources haa
also been more evenly distributed
making it possible to launch a major
offensive against backward municipal
and public services inherited from the
past.
In pre-Revolutionary Russia, only
214 cities had water supplies and a
mere 23 had sewage systems. Today,
water supplies and sewage systems
had been provided for all cities.
Electricity for domestic use was
universal in Soviet cities and the
housing conditions of the urban
population had been greatly improved.
"The problems of environmental
disruption in the U.S.S.R.", said Pro¬
fessor Semenov, "are partly of a
general nature, but possess their
specific features since they are linked
with the features of big socialist cities.
"Practically everything in such cities
is the property of the entire popu¬
lation, not of private individuals or
groups. Socialist cities do not have to
concern thermselves with restrictions
on the actions of certain social groups
or forces whose running of the
enterprises they own is detrimental
to the entire city and its environment.
They are concerned with organizing
scientifically grounded and conscious
control of the development of cities as
social organisms."
Many regulations had been imposed
in the U.S.S.R. in an attempt to control
urban construction and to establish
building norms and protect the atmos¬
phere, water resources and the soil
from harm caused by industry.
For Professor T. Isomura, of Osaka
Municipal University, pollution was a
world-wide phenomenon which requir¬
ed "an existentialist approach". For
him "Environmental disruption was
environmental disruption" wherever it
was found and differences in social
systems were of little consequence.
This view was not entirely shared
by Professor Chombard de Lauwe, of
France. Environmental disruption was
a many-faceted phenomenon which
could be classified broadly under five
separate but interrelated headings:
*social and
political, »pro¬
blems of development and education.
All these aspects had to be consider¬
ed in dealing with the problems of
pollution and the disruption of the
environment.
However much the participants may
have disagreed about the part eco¬
nomic and social structures played in
encouraging or discouraging dis¬
ruption of the environment, they were
all agreed that pollution was a real and
growing threat to the quality of life.
If our environment is to be pre¬
served, sociologists, scientists, eco¬
nomists and each member of the public n*T
will have to spend a little more time, £ /

and on Human Life, Musing in

reduce crop losses and prevent chan¬
ges in the structure of the soil. The
value of these wind breaks was strik¬
ingly demonstrated during the dust
storms that hit the Ukraine in 1969.
Fields protected by forest curtains
were scarcely affected, whereas crops
sown in unprotected fields were a total
or almost total loss. Forest screens
are still being planted in the Ukraine,
and this action, coupled with the cons¬
truction of reservoirs and careful
supervision of small rivers, has' pro¬
duced noteworthy results. The five-
year U.S.S.R. economic development
plan for 1971-1975 envisages a vast
reafforestation programme covering
12 million hectares.
Land development centres have been
set up to assume responsibility for
forests and water and land improve¬
ment, and the work of these centres is
helping to check erosion by water. The
flow rate of rivers is controlled, trees
are planted along river banks and
slopes and ravines are planted with
trees or sown with grass.
Q. You have mentioned forestry
development and some land develop¬
ment schemes. Are there any plans for
further schemes of this type?
A. Large scale operations are
under way in the Ukraine to bring
back into cultivation land formerly
worked for mineral ores. The Polesye
region, in the north of the Ukraine,
covers 20 per cent of the territory of
the Republic. It is a marshy and
extremely humid region. Drainage
work is now being undertaken there
and so far 1,750,000 acres have been
reclaimed. In the next few years it is
planned to reclaim a further 1,500,000
acres for cultivation.
There is also a water problem.
3,200 tons of water are needed to cul¬
tivate 2\ acres of maize; 750 lbs of
water for one lb of wheat grain. In¬
dustry too makes its demand upon
water resources; 150 tons of water
are used in the production of one ton
of steel; 5,000 tons for one ton of
nylon fibre.
Whilst industry is consuming huge
amounts of water, industrial waste
pollutes the water supply making it
unfit for use.
Q. This raises the problem of the
fight against water pollution. What is
being done about this in the Ukraine?
A. In some countries the pollution
of rivers and lakes has become a
matter of national concern. The United
States, for example, has turned to the
government of Canada to ask for sup¬
plies of pure fresh water to meet its
industrial and domestic requirements.
Preliminary estimates indicate that the
cost of installing and operating a water
supply pipeline may be as much as
$25,000 million.
The Ukraine has a relatively limited
water supply, 10 times less per inhabi¬
tant than any other region of the
Soviet Union. Since the demand for
water is increasing, water reserves
must be conserved.
River development schemes, in par¬
ticular the construction of large reser¬
voirs on the Dnieper, are helping to
increase the flow rate. The Ukraine is
criss-crossed by more than 19,000
small rivers, representing an important
water reserve. However, action by
man often causes rivers to silt up and
at times to dry up and disappear
completely. Small river development
schemes are being widely introduced,
not only by the State, but also by
collective farms (Kolkhozes) and State
farms (Sovkhozes) for whom such sche¬
mes are economically advantageous.
Development councils for several
kolkhozes are being set up through¬
out the Republic (more than 70 already
exist). With their combined economic
strength they are able to undertake
improvement works on a more ambi¬
tious scale.
The Republic has fairly large ground¬
water reserves, specially valuable for
domestic consumption, and the govern¬
ment pays particular attention to their
conservation. In 1968, the government
of the Republic decided to create a
special protected zone in the Northern
Donetz Valley which contains a reserve
of 1,500 million cubic metres of pure
fresh groundwater.
Q. What is being done to clean
up polluted rivers, lakes, etc?
A. A number of important mea¬
sures are being taken to protect
rivers from the effluent of oil refi¬
neries, metallurgical plants, paper
mills, cellulose factories, etc. The
Ukraine government allocates more
than 100 million roubles annually for
the construction of purification plants,
and experiments being carried out by
a number of industrial firms, who are
attempting to meet their water require¬
ments by means of a water cycle that
eliminates industrial effluents, are
being closely studied. In a decree
relating to "measures for improving
health protection and the advancement
of medical science", the Ukraine gov¬
ernment has made the construction
of purification plants a top priority for
all major industrial firms.
Throughout the world, industry pro¬
duces annually hundreds of millions of
tons of noxious waste which pollutes
the atmosphere and makes it danger¬
ous for both plant and animal life.
The rapid growth of road transport
using petroleum-based fuel has con¬
tributed to air pollution by increasing
the carbon dioxide content of the
atmosphere at the expense of oxygen.
The carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide,
hydrocarbons and lead are all carcino¬
genic substances.
Q. What steps are being taken
in the Ukraine to counter this pollution
of the air?
A. The campaign against industrial
pollution of the air is a vast and
complex matter involving large scale
investment and the active participation
of scientists. Ukrainian scientists can
be proud of having invented valuable
systems for purifying gaseous dis¬
charges of all kinds, which are being
increasingly used by industry thanks to
State grants for their construction.
Large tracts of forest land are
needed if the air is to be effectively
purified. The Ukraine is not rich in
forests and those that exist cover only
12.8 per cent of the territory of the
Republic and are mainly concentrated
in the north. However, experiments
have shown that large scale afforest¬
ation is possible in the southern
regions of the Ukraine. The extensive
forests that have sprung up in the

Askania-Nova reserve, the Veliko-Ana-
dolsk woods and the plantations in the
sandy soil of the lower Dnieper cover¬
ing 150,000 acres, are tangible evi¬
dence of what can be done. In recent
years re-afforestation of river banks
has been pushed ahead with a con¬
siderable benefit to river water flow.
This work is the responsibility of the
Republic's Ministry of Forests and
the State centres for the development
of forests and land improvement.
Q. Mr. Voltovski, is your commit¬
tee concerned with any other aspects
of the protection of nature?
A. Our committee is also responsi¬
ble for the protection of animal life.
At a time when certain species on our
planet are becoming extinct, others,
thanks to the protective measures
taken, are finding a new lease of life
in the Ukraine. Over the last few
decades, the elk population has multi¬
plied several times until it is now at
the limit of biological viability; the same
is true for deer of which there are now
15,000 head.
The fauna of the Republic has been
enriched by new species such as the
ondatra (a genus of rodent) and the
nocturnal procyonidae (a family of car¬
nivorous animals which includes rac¬
coons).
There is a great deal more that I
could tell you about measures taken
to protect the natural resources of the
Ukraine. However, I would merely like
to emphasize that these are problems
of concern not only to a certain number
of Ministries, but also to public opin¬
ion in general and to each individual
citizen in particular. In the Ukraine,
voluntary societies for the protection of
nature, with their 6è million members,
and various sporting associations with
500,000 members, play a major role.
Their work is extremely important and
their contribution to the protection of
nature is considerable. The combined
efforts of the entire population will
make it possible not only to prevent
air and water pollution, but also to
increase the natural wealth of the
country.
Modern technology enables
man literally to move
mountains and change the
courses of rivers at his will.
But in grasping the bounty
of nature he often leaves
behind him gaping wounds
and terrible scars. Above, a
huge man-made mountain
of rock and sand rises near
a gold-mining project amid
the vastness of the Kara-Kum
desert in the U.S.S.R.

Industrialization
without pollution:
a challenge to the
developing world
T
| HE relationship of man with
his natural environment and the arti¬
ficial environment he has created by
his domination of and aggression
against nature has to be examined as
a whole. It must be looked at in a
historic perspective, at all relevant
levels, starting with technology and
ending with psychology and aesthetics,
and taking into account the interplay
between all these factors.
It is not enough to look at nature
and the man-made environment from
the standpoint of economics, that is,
to consider nature in terms of con¬
servation of resources and artificial
environment in terms of externalities
and costs.
Nor am I pleading for a return to
the romantic conception of the com¬
munion of man with nature. Economics
must be reintegrated with ethics,
politics and even aesthetics, at least
at the level of global long-term
planning.
The 1969 report of the United
Nations Secretary-General on Prob¬
lems of the Human Environment
rightly stresses:
"In planning and management of the
human environment, emphasis is
generally placed on economic criteria
and on physical and quantitative
aspects of the problems more than
on qualitative and socio-cultural
aspects. This results in many large-
scale developments, particularly in
housing, which do not fully respond
30
IGNACY SACHS (Brazil) is an economist
and specialist in problems of development.
He is at present director of studies (Civi¬
lization, Environment and Long-Term
Planning) at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes,
in Paris. Former head of the Centre for
Research on Economic Underdevelopment,
in Warsaw, Poland (his country of birth), he
has been an adviser on development
questions to Unesco, the U.N. and other
international organizations.
to legitimate human aspirations and
social needs."
Moreover, "alternative development
projects having different environmental
consequences are rarely studied and
economic choices are made with little
reference to environmental con¬
sequences, particularly those of an
ecological nature. This applies particu¬
larly to large-scale development
projects in less developed countries."
The reasons for this highly unsatis¬
factory state of affairs are threefold.
Firstly, the progress of economics
as a scientific discipline is closely
related to its ability to find a common
denominator for all sorts of goods and
activities in what the economist terms
exchange value.
But the price paid for this is a heavy
one: considerations of use value as
such are excluded. True, Marxian
economics recognizes that the exis¬
tence of use value is a prerequisite
for exchange value, but it does not
need for the purposes of further ana¬
lysis any concrete insight into this use
value.
As for the theories based on
marginal utility, for all practical
purposes, they also leave aside quali¬
tative analysis, trying, at best, to find
another kind of common denominator
based on subjective appreciation of
an abstract utility.
Thus liberated from qualitative
analysis, economics succeeded in
designing some quite sophisticated
quantitative methods to deal with
them. One of the consequences of
this development is that economists
are often tempted to discard as
irrelevant those factors which they do
not succeed in quantifying.
Secondly, we should recall here the
individualistic origins of economic
thinking, centered on the individual
economic agent or the individual
enterprise.
To clarify this point, let me give
an example. Let us suppose that we
are analyzing a big capital-intensive
agricultural project and that applica¬
tion of advanced mechanized tech¬
niques is likely to increase the stream
of rural migrants to urban areas.
Cases, of course, can be thought of
where mechanization ends up by
creating more agricultural employment
than it releases, by making possible
a change in production functions and
in the intensity of cropping.
Are we supposed to quantify this
social cost in order to include it in
the cost-benefit analysis of our agri¬
cultural project? And if so, should
we consider the cost of urban develop¬
ments made necessary to resorb the
shantytowns likely to be created by
the rural migrants? Would this be a
sufficient approximation of the social
cost of such a migration, or should
we also deal with the social disruption
involved, on the one hand, and the
difference between the investment
cost of additional jobs in towns as
compared to rural areas, on the
other?
_ _ 	 OREOVER, confusion may
arise between what it a goal and
what is a means, not to speak of the
fact that for many countries and for
quite a time, speedy economic growth
may still be a major goal.
I believe that it is necessary to
change the whole approach by re¬
versing the procedure: instead of
studying the impact of the individual
actions on the global system, it would
be advisable to work out the implic¬
ations of alternative sets of goals
chosen for the system as a whole and
take them as the start point of an
exercise in global strategy framing and
genuine long-term planning.

WHERE IS THE MAGIC CARPET? Anyone who has ever had the good fortune to
partake of the traditional tea ceremony in a Moroccan town or village, can only
wince at this extraordinary photo. Where, indeed, is that magic carpet?
But the theory of planning in its
present form is not at all designed
for this task. For historical reasons,
it originated with an almost exclusive
preoccupation with growth, and long-
term planning was merely an offshoot
of short and medium-term planning.
Nor is present-day futurology a
good substitute for, or a complement
of, traditional long-term planning
because of its excessive preoccup¬
ation with projections of wealth as well
as of scientific and technological
progress and its lack of sociological
and historical imagination.
In my view, there could be no
better model for long-term global
planning than urbanism. This is a
discipline which at least in principle
if not always in practice unifies social
vision, and a good deal of utopism,
in the best sense of the word, with
an interdisciplinary analysis of forces
at work and of goals and means.
This calls for an entirely new ration¬
ality, different both from that of the
industrial enterprise and of the tra¬
ditional State. Such global long-term
planning should be based on urbanism
and ecology, but also on an ensemble
of moral and philosophical values. In
this approach, considerations of
environment would have, of course,
a permanent and prominent place.
The problem has two distinct levels.
The first is that of appropriate planning
and decision-making machinery. The
second is related to the impact of
social and economic regimes on the
possibilities of implementing long-term
global planning in general, and of a
rational action on the environment in
particular.
Global planning and selection of
society's goals imply, on the one hand,
a thorough exploration of the pos¬
sibilities open both from the socio¬
logical and economic points of view
and on the other, choosing a set of
ethical and aesthetic values. Quite
obviously, the choices are limited by
certain unchanging factors in human
society the impact of tradition, the
burden of slowly changing structures
(that of the family, for example) etc.
Nor are all the goals feasible in
terms of available economic resources,
though these, to some extent, will
depend on the choice of society's
goals and institutions. A happy choice
of such goals should add to the
efficiency of the economic per¬
formance (and inversely, an unhappy
choice and the ensuing frustration and
alienation are likely to hamper the
working of the economic system).
It may be useful to point out here
that, in a sense, all societies invariably
set out to accomplish a number of
goals, even though the choices may
not have been identified, made
explicit and taken consciously. Up
to now, long-term goals have seldom
been identified, even in centrally
planned economies, and fundamental
choices (such as increased material
wealth against more leisure, the
denrée of egalitarianism in incomes
distribution, the ratio of individual to
collective consumption, etc.) have
been made by short or medium-term
decisions.
To my knowledge, alternative
projects of civilization have never
been explicity compared as a founda¬
tion for variants of long-term strategy
and planning, although they may have
been discussed here and there by
philosophers and social thinkers. We

INDUSTRIALIZATION WITHOUT POLLUTION (Continued)
A third way for the Third World

shall need to start almost from rock
bottom in order to reach a more ope¬
rative stage in applying "systems-think¬
ing" to actual long-term planning.
In particular, we need more know¬
ledge about the types, scope, degree
of flexibility, time-scheduling and inter¬
connexions of the decisions which must
be taken in order to implement a
coherent set of goals for society.
More reflection is also necessary on
the type of political institutions capable
of organizing and channelling the dis¬
cussion on the long-term prospects of
a particular society and of getting the
consensus of public opinion.
Let us turn now to the imple¬
mentation of a global strategy of
development and of environmental
control embodied in it. Undoubtedly,
the very nature of environmental dis¬
ruption as we know it is the result
of a specific process of indus¬
trialization. The case of Japan is a
striking example. (See article page 6.)
To quote a specific example of how
the institutions of a society can limit
rational control of the environment,
most specialists in urban problems
would agree that private ownership
of land makes it more difficult to apply
modern concepts of town planning.
Similarly, private industralists argue
that prevention of air and water
pollution at factory level will be
impossible unless all competitors,
whether domestic or foreign, are
compelled to install the same type of
preventive equipment and thus incur
similar extra costs.
In other words, effective pollution
control would need a very elaborate
and cumbersome system of inter¬
national regulation (so long as we are
thinking in terms of a free-trade world
economy). The alternative is, of
course, for the taxpayer to bear the
burden of environmental control costs,
in accordance with the capitalistic
principle that, wherever possible, costs
should be socialized and profits
individualized.
Thus, hidden behind the supposedly
technical problems of environmental
control lie fundamental social contra¬
dictions. Far from distracting attention
from political struggles, the environ¬
ment issue may well, on the contrary,
provide new arguments to radical
movements of protest against the
global irrationality of the capitalist
system.
Many developing countries suffer
from the same institutional limitations
which, in most industrialized countries,
hamper global planning in general and
environmental control in particular. In
others, however, a fair measure of
state intervention is being accepted
and the absence of private control
over a substantial range of resources
should make things easier.
But the difficulties of setting up
appropriate machinery for planning
and policy-making are enormous.
Moreover, many people are inclined
to believe that the pressure of im¬
mediate problems is so overwhelming
as to demand the postponement of
long-term considerations. Since en¬
vironmental disruption is associated
with a high level of industrial develop¬
ment, developing countries may be
less concerned with this issue which
is often presented as the reverse side
of material advancement and progress.
In my opinion both these views
are wrong for a variety of reasons.
First of all, the lack of a long-term,
system-planned, global strategy makes
it more difficult, if not virtually im¬
possible, to find reasonable medium-
term solutions (the short-term being
to a great extent pre-determined by
existing circumstances).
In any case, consideration of long-
term prospects must start sometime
and the pressure of immediate prob¬
lems will always be there. The less
developed a country is, the more it
should look for short cuts towards
development and, therefore, the less
it can afford costly mistakes arising
from lack of a global strategy.
Secondly, highly industrialized pock¬
ets and over-populated towns exist
in almost all developing countries and
in these areas pollution phenomena
often appear with unparalleled in¬
tensity. Furthermore, the predatory
exploitation of natural resources so
common in many former colonies
and dependent countries, was often
accompanied by severe environmental
disruption.
To this must be added the influence
of the example of the consumption
pattern and way of life in the highly
industrialized countries which is likely
to push several developing countries
along a line of development marked by
extensive environmental disruption, not
to mention the internal pressures of
the rural exodus and the consequent
rapid growth of shanty towns.
Thus, the belief that less devel¬
oped countries are affected to a lesser
degree by disruption of the environ¬
ment is unfounded. On the contrary,
it is tempting to say that pollution is a
symptom of modernity that comes well
in advance of other more desirable
features of industrialization. Never¬
theless, the developing countries still
have, on the whole, more opportunity
to operate on a preventive basis than
the developed ones, and they should
seize this opportunity one of the very
few advantages reserved for the late¬
comers.
At first sight, prevention of environ¬
mental disruption may appear far too
expensive for countries in which abso¬
lute priority continues to be given to
accelerated economic growth, measur
ed by increase in the national income,
and social progress, achieved through
a more equitable distribution of the
growing national cake.
But further consideration leads to a
more qualified attitude. If, other things
being equal, the relative cost of
measures taken against environmental
disruption is much higher for a poor
than a rich country, it might also be
true that the social price of pollution
and the disruptive social effects involv¬
ed are correspondingly higher in a
poor country whose inhabitants are
more vulnerable to its devastating
action on physical and mental health
and who are less prepared to take
corrective measures. This is a subject
about which very little is known and
which certainly merits careful inves¬
tigation.
Furthermore, there is no proof that,
for a given country, the cost of rational
and carefully planned use of the
environment will ultimately be higher
than the outlays on curative measures
made necessary by a period of preda¬
tory economics.
Several developing countries should
be able to implement major environ¬
mental control works by using labour-
intensive methods, thus combining
long-term social goals with short-term
employment targets. The only limita¬
tions to such activities are the avail¬
ability of food and the organizational
problems involved. The example of
Mainland China with respect to water
conservancy works and reforestation
is very instructive.
| INALLY, prevention of evil
should always be preferred to thera¬
peutic action on ethical grounds.
But it may prove impossible to
obtain substantial results if only piece¬
meal, defensive action is envisaged
when industrial and urban projects are
being implemented. At best certain
causes of pollution will be eliminated
in new industrial and town units while
others may be added (e.g. pollution
of air as a consequence of an increase
in the number of motor cars in use).
This leads us back to our initial
considerations. Rational use of the
environment is but one aspect of a
broader design linking man to his
natural and artificial environment. The
opportunity still, perhaps, open to
some developing countries is that of
conceiving original projects of civiliza¬
tion differing in many respects from
those now being implemented by the
industrialized countries, whether capi¬
talistic or socialistic.
The road to effective, global, long-
term planning and environmental
control leads, at least for a time,
through Utopian systems thinking.

PARISIAN LION CUBS
BRING IN AFRICAN DOE
Lion cubs born at the zoo-park of Thoiry, 20 miles from Paris, will soon be
roaming the jungles of equatorial Africa. Over 50 lion cubs are born each year
at Thoiry, thus creating an overpopulation problem for the zoo. Its owner has
now arranged to ship several dozen lion cubs each year to African countries
where illicit big-game poaching has seriously depleted the number of lions,
even in game reserves. In exchange for the cubs, the Thoiry zoo will receive
shipments of other animals, particularly gazelles.

Letters to the Editor
SEA BIRDS IN PERIL
Sir,
A great deal has been published
recently about pollution of the air that
we breathe due to exhaust fumes, pollu¬
tion of our food by insecticides, pollu¬
tion of rivers by industrial effluents,
pollution of beaches due to sewage,
and so on. Now we have a growing
menace in the increasing pollution of
the sea by leaking tankers.
Very recently a large tanker, the
"Wafra", ran aground about 100 miles
from Cape Town and many tons of
both diesel and fuel oil leaked from
damaged tanks before the ship was pull¬
ed off, towed out to sea and sunk. As
a result of oil on the surface of the
sea and the beaches, hundreds of birds
have died. Some, however, have been
rescued by the volunteer members of
the South African Foundation for the
Conservation of Sea Birds (of which
I am a member). Although we strive
to rescue all birds in trouble we pay
particular attention to cleaning and re¬
habilitating the Black-footed or Jackass
Penguin which only exists in this part
of the world, and is a fast diminishing
species.
The work of our foundation involves
catching, cleaning, feeding and finally
liberating the oiled-up birds. Penguins,
gannets, sea gulls and cormorants
receive this treatment and are ringed
before release. The penguin is, of
course, more vulnerable to damage by
oil because it cannot fly and invariably
swims right into a slick when coming
ashore.

THE PUBLIC AND MODERN ART
Sir,
It is difficult to draw definitive conclu¬
sions about public tastes in modern art
on the basis of a poll carried out in
a single city. Such is the case of
the Toronto Inquiry described in your
March 1971 number, especially since it
covered only paintings by artists from
western Europe and America.
Even so, those who carried out the
inquiry have perhaps been too cautious
in their evaluation of the results. In
reality, the data already obtained
enables a number of very specific con¬
clusions to be drawn from the inquiry.
Is not the public's preference for
such modern works as Picasso's "The
Old Guitarist" or Wyeth's "A Day at
the Fair" convincing proof of the vita¬
lity of these paintings and of the effect
on the viewer of a truly human art
which takes man as its subject and
has a message for men and women?
Surely it is these qualities (and not the
"conservatism" of public taste, as those
who conducted the inquiry assume) that
made Millet's hundred-year-old painting,
"The Ángelus", the overall first choice.
It is not merely by chance that we
find at one end of the scale (among the
most popular works), Cezanne's "Boy
with the Red Waistcoat", Buffet's "The
Railway Station" and Renoir's "The Box
at the Theatre", and at the other (among
the unpopular works), such abstract
paintings as Castellon's "The Dark Fig¬
ure", Arp's "Profile" and Miro's "Snob
Party at the Princess's".
Significantly, the dates of works in
both these categories of paintings refute
decisively the hypothesis of the famous
"fifty year gap" between creative inno¬
vation in art and its general acceptance
by the public. Those interviewed during
the inquiry rejected Mondrian's canva¬
ses, painted at the beginning of the
century and allegedly "rich in content",
but accepted a work by Buffet dating
from 1955.
In the Toronto Inquiry, it seems to
us that the public expressed its attitude
very clearly. It is quite evident that
its preferences went to an art of con¬
crete forms which embodies clear and
firm shapes. As a general rule it re¬
jected works of an abstract or surrealist
type; in other words art which lacks
content or which is absurd, that is, art
which is basically "anti-human".
According to the specialists respon¬
sible for the inquiry, the public did not,
in general, like paintings in which fami¬
liar shapes were arbitrarily distorted.
On the other hand, this non-specialist
public showed itself to be capable of
understanding and accepting distortions
where it felt that these were justified
by artistic considerations, for example
in Picasso's "The Enamel Saucepan",
painted in 1944.
Does not this mean that art is in¬
extricably linked with the notion of what
is "beautiful" and "harmonious"? And
is not the absence of these same qua¬
lities one reason why the public rejects
a certain type of modern painting?
But what, in fact, did the public in
Toronto reject? Was it the selection of
paintings shown to them or was it
modern art in general? In short, how
should the present-day museum of
modern art be planned and organized?
It might also be asked whether one
can attempt to assess the public's atti¬
tude towards contemporary art without
asking it to judge sculpture and graphic
arts such as drawing and engraving,
which play a no less important role
and often an even greater one than
that of painting in the evolution of 20th
century art?
Was it not a mistake for the orga¬
nizers of the inquiry to leave out such
great examples of modern art as those
linked with the names of artists and
sculptors such as Kollwitz and Mase-
reel, Marquet and Maillol, Kent and
Siqueiros, Despiau and Barlach, Aal-
tonen and Mestrovic, Zuloaga and
Brangwyn? The omission of works by
modern Soviet painters and by artists
from the Far and Middle East also con¬
siderably diminished the scope of the
"museum" created for the inquiry.
If a wider range and greater variety
of paintings had been presented at
Toronto, the features and trends of mod¬
ern art that provoke positive or negative
reactions from the public would have
been revealed with much greater pre¬
cision.
While striving to present a broad and
varied panorama of contemporary art,
a museum should make a point of dis¬
playing works of an experimental
nature. But museums of modern art,
unless they are content to remain
"ivory tower" museums, should be based
on works that respond, deeply and
fully, to the questions that preoccupy
modern man.
As the evolution of art throughout
the centuries shows, the trends which
prove finally to be the most meaningful
and the most viable are those that
are linked with the progress of society,
those in which truly human creative
qualities are self-evident. Indeed, it
is only through works of art of social
significance that the museum can fulfil
one of its most important functions the
aesthetic education of the public.
Like our colleagues in Toronto, we
attach great importance to the public's
views on modern art and on modern
art museums. That is why every encour¬
agement should be given to worthwhile
initiatives such as the Toronto Inquiry.
And if practical use is made by museo-
logists of the results of such inquiries
and an attentive ear turned towards the
public, perhaps people will no longer
stay away from museums of modern
art.

UNIVERSITY OF MALAWI
Sir-,
I am grateful to you for publishing
my letter in your March 1971 issue.
However, lest we provoke a national
incident, I should point out that Limbe
is certainly not in Zambia but in Mal¬
awi, and is the home of the National
University of that country.

KEEP THE WINDOW OPEN
Sir,
As I see it Unesco's task is to open
people's eyes and awaken their
consciences to the innumerable injus¬
tices that exist on our planet. Why
not publish more issues on the iworld
problem of hunger we cannot have too
many on apartheid, on the situation in
Rhodesia and other African countries,
and on some of the problems of Latin
America? Please don't close the
shutters of your "window open on the
world".

Owing to an unfortunate misun¬
derstanding, no mention was made
in our June issue on Modern
Chemistry of M. Jacques G.
Richardson's contribution as
consulting scientific adviser in
the overall planning of the theme
and in the editing and preparation
of manuscripts.

IN THE SOCIAL
AND HUMAN SCIENCES
Part I : Social Sciences
This major work is the outcome of a broad international
study initiated by Unesco in 1965 in collaboration with over
200 specialists and 12 professional associations and research
institutions. Reporting on the main trends of research in
the social and human sciences, it aims, in the words of
Claude Lévi-Strauss, to identify "the paths on which. . .
the science of tomorrow may embark."
Co-authors of "Main Trends" are the following interna¬
tionally-known scholars in the social and human sciences:
P. F. Lazarsfeld (Sociology). W. J. M. Mackenzie (Political Science).
Jean Piaget (Psychology,). Jean Bourgeois-Pichat (Demography).
Jean Piaget (General problems of interdisciplinary | research and mecha¬
nisms). Roman Jakobson (Linguistics). Raymond Boudon (Mathematical
models and methods). Pierre de Bie (Problem-focused research). Stein
Rokkan (Cross-cultural, cross societal and cross-national research). Eric Trist
(The organization and financing of research).
