o ZAIRE Woman ancestor symbol
This "pwo" mask of the Chokwe', an African people numbering some 600.000 and living in
Zaire, Zambia and especially Angola, symbolically portrays a woman ancestor. Unlike many
Chokwe masks, which are made of painted barkcloth on a wicker frame, "pwo" masks are
always carved in wood, and are topped with a wig of vegetable fibres or hair. Often fashioned
in the image of women famed for their beauty, the masks are worn exclusively by itinerant
male dancers. Chokwe artists skilfully incorporate in their sculpture traditional decorative
motifs (interlaced patterns, chevrons, etc.) charged with symbolic meaning.

The current world food crisis is far more
serious than is generally realized. Hunger
and famine are not its only consequences.
No less crucial is the malnutrition which
today afflicts millions of children and
adults. The United Nations World Food
Programme, a major distributor of food
aid, had set a target of $440 million to help
close the world food gap in 1975-1976,
but it is now clear that far more than this
will be needed. Each year the world
spends $300 billion on arms. Could not
part of the immense sum thrown away on
weapons be used to save human lives?

With food
by Marcel Ganzin
AVAST amount has been
written about famine in devel¬
oping countries such as Ethiopia,
Bangladesh and those of the African
Sahel, and about malnutrition in many
others. A host of statements, resol¬
utions and recommendations was
formulated at the U.N. World Food
Conference held in Rome in November
1974, similar to many others from
earlier conferences and meetings on
the problem of hunger In the world.
In fact, so much has already been
written and said about the world food
crisis and so many measures and
solutions have been proposed, that it
may seem presumptuous, or even un¬
necessary, to broach the subject
yet again.
However, when one tries to look at
the situation about which world opinion
is so deeply concerned, but in clearer
perspective and from a fresh and
objective viewpoint, ways of analyzing
it come readily to mind.
One finds, for example, that history
offers many echoes of what is cur¬
rently claimed to be an exceptional
occurrence. These echoes are all the
more disconcerting since they go back
to the distant past. The story of
mankind has been punctuated by
disastrous and recurrent food short¬
ages, and these have been followed by
vigorous revivals and periods of pros¬
perity. Many invasions, wars and
migrations had no other motive than
the quest for food.
I propose simply to bring out and to
analyze possible similarities between
past situations and what is happening
today. If these similarities turn out to
be purely superficial then history has
nothing to teach us. If on the other
hand we find that major disasters such
as the famines of our own time are not
absolutely exceptional, viewed in an
historical context, then we may have to
revise our thinking on the subject.
In other words, is the current food
crisis the result of exceptional circum-
MARCEL GANZIN is Director of the Food
Policy and Nutrition Division of the Food and
Agriculture Organization, in Rome. A specialist
on problems of malnutrition, he has published
numerous studies on the inter-reactions of
vitamins and on protein changes, and has carried
out pioneer research in the fields of electro¬
phoresis and globulins.
stances, or does it form part of a much
more ancient pattern?
During the past two decades it
seemed as if the industrialized
countries were positively bursting with
"surpluses". One has only to think of
the subsidies paid to farmers to hold
down the production of certain food¬
stuffs, and various projects of the
Common Agricultural Policy in Europe.
Governments had to take major steps
to retrain redundant manpower in the
farming industry and to absorb food
surpluses. In simple economic terms,
supply exceeded demand.
Suddenly, and apparently unexpec¬
tedly, this situation changed in 1970.
Almost overnight, world demand for
cereals the most heavily traded
foodstuffs outstripped supply. Some
people have no hesitation in ascribing
this increase in demand to the popu¬
lation explosion, whose pace has accel¬
erated rapidly in recent years.
Falling death rates due to success¬
ful public health campaigns, mass
education programmes and undeniable
social progress have stimulated rapid
population growth. But there is
another highly important factor which
affects population growth rates, namely
poverty. We all too often forget that
poverty and population increases go
hand in hand, and that poverty itself
is prolific.
But, while 75 "million new mouths to
feed in the world each year admittedly
constitute a major additional pressure
on agriculture, is rapid population
growth really as new as the sudden
interest in it would seem to suggest?
The growing wealth of the already
well-fed industrialized world has also
added considerably to world food
demand and has actually speeded up
the flow from Third World countries of
the foodstuffs they produce.
It becomes easier to understand the
present paradoxical situation, if one
classifies the world's nations under
four headings:
1. Oil and cereal producers;
2. Oil producers-cereal importers;
3. Cereal producers-oil importers;
4. Importers of oil and cereals.
The countries in the first category
are invulnerable; those in the second
Hunger is a curious
thing : at first it is with
you all the time, working
and sleeping and in your
dreams, and your belly
cries out insistently, and
there is a gnawing and
a pain as if your very
vitals were being
devoured, and you must
stop it at any cost ...
Then the pain is no longer
sharp but dull, and this
too is with you always.

k have a means of defence, though they
remain vulnerable with regard to food
supply; as for the countries in the third
category, their economies come under
crushing pressure, but they at least
possess the technological resources to
cope with the situation for a certain
length of time.
Countries in the last category,
however, those with the least re¬
sources, are vulnerable from all sides.
They are suffering most from the new
type of economic warfare which is not
of their seeking and for which most of
them are unarmed. And yet these
countries are sufficiently numerous to
make up an entire "world" of their own,
which one might well term the Fourth
World.
So while the crisis is not in fact too
serious for those countries that have
oil to exchange for cereals, or vice
versa, the situation is tragic for those
that have nothing except perhaps
their membership of the Fourth World
and which are having to suffer the
consequences.
Lester Brown in his excellent book
"By Bread Alone" (1), deals with the
question of individual responsibilities
for the current situation, describes
the development of agriculture from
the earliest times up to the present
day, and gives a brief outline of the
famines that have marked the history
of mankind.
Reading this book made me want to
find the answers to several questions
regarding the current food crisis. Is it
a problem peculiar to this decade or
is it a cyclical occurrence due either to
particularly adverse physical, econ¬
omic and social conditions or to
certain imbalances that have become
especially acute in recent times?
Moreover, is the cereal crisis the
determining factor in the whole human
and animal food supply situation?
The widespread fear today that the
Earth may prove incapable of feeding
a population that is growing faster than
ever before deserves some attention.
So I have made extensive use of Jean
Claudian's interesting study, "La
France et les Français" (2), taking as a
basis for comparison the history of
France's food supply since prehistoric
times, in an attempt to find out
whether the current world food short¬
age is an exceptional or a periodic
occurrence and to establish its causes.
"Western European man's great food
adventure began around the dawn of
the 8th millenium B.C. as the last Ice
Age receded," writes Jean Claudian,
"...it was to draw to a close some
5,000 years later, by which time the
temperate climate and its accompany¬
ing vegetation had replaced the icy
tundra..."
"The 8th and the 7th millenia saw
the gradual disappearance of the big

Philippines campaigns
for better food
and bigger harvests
The introduction of new high-yield varieties of wheat
and rice and the opening up of new agricultural land
have boosted harvests spectacularly in some
developing countries of Asia. Photo opposite : lush
rice-paddies in the Philippines, where the new rice
grown under irrigation produced yields between two
and three times higher than those of traditional
strains. But since 1972 poor harvests due to appalling
weather, a run-down of grain reserves and staggering
increases in world fertilizer and cereal prices have left
most countries in the developing world hungrier than
ever before. Solutions to the present world food
crisis, with its two faces of famine and malnutrition,
are increasingly seen as being directly linked to other
global problems such as population, development,
trade, resources, land reform and armaments.

, game adapted to the frozen steppe
(reindeer, wild horses, aurochs, deer),
and signs of a food crisis made their
appearance..."
During the 6th and 5th millenia men
began to develop methods of sup¬
plementing their hunting and fruit-
gathering activities and "implements
found in Mesolithic settlements show
a marked trend towards a production
economy (livestock breeding and crop
cultivation)." The situation improved
noticeably.
The battle against the forest in
order to "clear space required for
cultivation and for grazing land for the
first domestic herbivores" was waged
"with axes in the North, and with fire
in the South." The stone hoe, soon
followed by a primitive sickle, the
millstone and, above all, earthenware
utensils from the Near East, all marked
a distinct progress, crowned by the
advent of the ploughshare.
"The peasant structure, based on
the farm and the village, was firmly
established in the course of the Neo¬
lithic period, and was to survive
without any major changes right
through to the 18th and 19th centuries
of our own era."
The basic diet in Neolithic times
consisted of wheat, millet and barley,
eaten either in the form of gruel or flat
cakes; fruit and vegetables were still
being gathered and were consumed in
considerable quantities. There were
also regional specialities, such as
cheese in the South, and butter in
the North. Generally speaking the
problem of finding food had ceased to
be a constant anxiety for these people.
The coming of the Bronze Age and
the arrival of a number of inventions
from the East made it possible to yoke
oxen for ploughing and also improved
food preservation. As a result, "the
Neo'ithic peasant ploughed land,
reared livestock and ate cereals. He
therefore enjoyed a relatively secure
food supply, something that had been
denied his ancestors" and "this new
situation was to have a major impact
on population biology, and on popu¬
lation growth in particular..."
"The population of what is now
France increased tenfold in the course
of the Mesolithic period, which lasted
2,500 years. It grew by as much
again during the 3rd millenium alone,
by which time the population had fully
mastered the techniques required to
operate the new type of economy . . .
From this we must conclude that the
changes in life-style and diet brought
about by the Neolithic Revolution were
responsible for the most powerful
population spurt in human history.
Another 4,000 years were to pass
before the world's population would
undergo another comparable rate of
increase..."
"The traditional agricultural life of
France reached its zenith during the
early Bronze Age, before suffering a
marked decline as a result of the
invasion of the Gauls, from which it took
a long time to recover..." Gaul, "only
regained a certain prosperity some
centuries later ... its economy flourish¬
ed considerably in the course of the
early centuries of the Roman domin¬
ation (58 B.C. to 480 A.D.)."
We can see from this that technical
progress gave rise to a prosperous
agriculture which, in turn, led to an
enormous increase in population, which
itself further boosted this prosperity.
External factors, however, brought all
this to nought for a period of several
centuries.
In addition, as prosperity declined,
so did the rate of population growth.
The population only began to increase
again some time later, in Gaulish
France, but the colonial-type prosperity
then dominant only benefited a small
fraction of the population, and the
collapse of the social system once
more resulted in a stagnant population
over a long period (see box below).
One should not try to draw any hard
and fast conclusions from these
figures, but they do suggest that
certain regions of the world have, at
widely distant periods in history,
suffered food and population crises,
which, if we allow for differences in
scale, were just as serious as our
present ones. The point is that these
problems were overcome, and that they
subsequently arose afresh. Yet popu¬
lation increase does not appear to have
been responsible for famine.
I certainly have no intention of
making any extrapolations from these
examples, since there is no basis
for comparison with present conditions,
but it is worth noting that the great
famines and periods of dearth recorded
in Medieval France occurred at times
when there was no shortage of food.
Indeed, they occurred at times when
food was being produced in great
quantities and was even being
exported.
The social system was largely to
blame for these shortages. "Even in
the 16th and 17th centuries we can
identify 24 periods of more or less
generalized famine . . .accompanied by
hemeralopia [reduced visual ca¬
pacity in bright light] due to Vitamin A
deficiency, and scurvy." In an age
when the nobles and the rich bour¬
geoisie were discovering the delights
of refined cooking, people were still
dying of hunger in France, although
admittedly this was nothing new.
What was new, however, was that
for the first time, the wretched con¬
dition of the common people aroused
the concern of a few generous-minded
men. "La Bruyère and then Vauban
roundly condemned the misery of the
'poor classes, which are the most
numerous' and 'the most dispossessed
and the most wretched in the king¬
dom'..."
"It was in eighteenth-century France
that, for the first time in history, the
idea of equal rights for all to the
goods of this world and to a decent
diet germinated and became firmly
rooted. This truly revolutionary notion
finally put paid to age-old ideas
according to which unequal nourish¬
ment and social inequality in general
were perfectly normal and part of the
nature of things.
"Forty years before the French
Revolution, the common people in
France were still considered a race
apart, whose coarser palates and more
robust stomachs could be fed with
anything that would serve to keep
their hunger at bay."
Such prejudices disappeared forever
with the upheavals of the Great
Revolution of 1789. But while one
could say that food is equitably shared
in France today though, for economic
reasons, the diet of many aged
persons still leaves much to be desired
one can hardly say the same for
the world as a whole.
France's population expanded rap¬
idly in the course of the 19th century
(21 million inhabitants in 1750,
36 million in 1850), as did the popu¬
lation of Europe as a whole. But now
that the social structure had been
modified, periods of rising food prices
no longer produced famines.
It would seem then that the world
as a whole is now experiencing what
France herself went through in the
course of her own history, though on
a different scale. The speed of

Every year hundreds of thousands
of children are blinded by
xerophthalmia, a disease caused by
lack of vitamin A, and countless others
suffer from a deficiency of proteins
and other essential nutrients. In
Northern Thailand many children
suffer from protein deficiencies
because 84 per cent of their calories
come from rice most of whose oil,
minerals and vitamins have been
removed by polishing. Campaigns
have therefore been launched to
improve nutrition by adding high-
protein food manufactured from
locally grown vegetables such as
mung and soy beans to the diets
of young children. Left, a Thai child

transport and the global diffusion of
information have transformed the scale
of things, and social imbalances are
no longer national but international.
A drop in stock exchange prices in the
industrialized countries, their crises,
their inflation, their unequally dis¬
tributed incomes all have very grave
repercussions on the economies of the
poor countries, especially since the
latters' social and economic structures
are far from developed.
Perhaps the current food crisis is
not basically due to insufficient pro¬
duction as some people claim, or to
the population explosion. There are
certainly other, deeper causes. For
example, the "feudalistic" system
governing the distribution of incomes,
employment, the utilization of fertilizers,
national and international investment
levels, etc., is probably quite as
responsible for the present situation,
if not more so, as climatic or ecological
conditions.
The wheat problem, the cereal prob¬
lem, the whole problem of agriculture
and even demographic equations may
simply disclose what are really social
distortions. The fact that these distor¬
tions are social in character means
they can be rectified, given sufficient
determination.
Once the chain of cause and effect
has been established, perhaps we may
be able to identify those processes
upon which action should be focussed.
A certain number of countries
benefitting from advantageous con¬
ditions and highly advanced tech¬
nology, have accumulated wealth and
food surpluses. They have been
unable to "dispose of" these surpluses
for the simple reason that less privi¬
leged countries lack the funds or the
currency reserves needed to buy even
a fraction of this surplus produce
(which could have eliminated food
deficits).
It has taken 20 years for people to
recognize the paradoxical nature of
the situation and to admit that the term
"excess" food production was highly
inappropriate when millions of human
beings would have been only too
delighted to make use of these costly-
to-store surpluses had they been
allowed to.
Unfortunately, through misuse of
language we have fallen into the habit
of describing food that fails to reach
consumers however needy as "ex
cess" produce. Similarly, when sub¬
sistence farmers are forced to sell food
to acquire a bare minimum of cash and
to maintain their place in the economic
system, we call this produce "market¬
able surplus", even though these
farmers do not have enough food for
themselves.
Of course, the world has not been
entirely deaf to the cries of the hungry.
A variety of food aid programmes
(World Food Programme, projects
under U.S. Public Law 480 [voted in
1956 for U.S. food surpluses to be
used as aid to other countries] and by
various non-governmental organiz¬
ations) have been launched to help the
poor countries, thus improving their
food supply situation and contributing
to their development, while at the same
time using up excess food.
Even so it has taken over twenty
years for people to realize that solvent
demand (demand backed by hard
cash), evolving on classical economic
lines and sometimes conditioned by
supply, serves as the driving force for
our economic system, today raised to
the status of a civilization which is now
increasingly challenged.
Until today, rising population curves,
aroused only very slight interest, r

TRAGEDY IN
k since they were seen as just one
aspect of changing conditions in poor
countries, the majority of whose in¬
habitants are too poor to exercise
much influence on global demand and
thus count for little in terms of inter¬
national trade.
But the operations of international
trade itself are also paradoxical. For
one thing, commodity markets (where
foodstuffs are traded) are almost
entirely governed by the profit motive,
despite the fact that food is ultimately
meant to be consumed. Nutritional
needs are not considered. The market
for animal feed generates more
interest in financial circles than the
market in food for hundreds of millions
of men, women and children. Indus¬
trialized countries can afford to pay for
food for animals; poor countries cannot
afford to pay for food for people.
There is another paradox, namely
that responsibility for maintaining food
reserves has been left to the producer
countries while importer countries
often have no more than a week's
supplies for their populations.
Among the producer countries, the
United States has been responsible for
maintaining the bulk of the world's
cereal reserves; in the 1960s these
stood at 200 million tons, equal to 3 or
4 months' consumption in the importer
countries.
When one considers that the cost
of storing these reserves comes to
around 10 per cent of the total value
of the produce (which means the
United States was spending around
U.S. $1 billion yearly), one can
readily understand why these reserves
declined to less than 100 million tons
in 1970.
The subsequent entry of the Soviet
Union and China into the international
grain market further helped to deplete
reserves, which by 1974 had fallen to
the alarmingly low level of 30 million
tons. This represents roughly ten
days' consumption. As a result of
poor harvests last year, these reserves
are likely to drop to 20 million tons
in 1975.
But that is only one side of the
cereal situation. The picture would be
incomplete if one only looked at the
material aspect and failed to take into
account the evolution of physiological
demand, which is determined basically
by the growing population and its
needs, and not by purchasing power
alone.
Over the last fifty years, the annual
increase in the physiological demand
for cereals has risen from 5 million
tons to around 30 million tons, to feed
the current yearly increase of 75 million
new mouths.
At the same time, annual per capita
consumption of cereals in the indus¬
trialized countries has risen to almost
one ton, of which over 90 per cent goes
to feed meat-producing animals. For
economic development and social
progress in every country in the world
have been marked by a positive
gluttony for meat. Wherever incomes
and purchasing power have risen, both
rich and poor countries alike have
reacted by increasing their meat
consumption.
This is partly because our economic
system places too much importance
on elasticity of demand. When this
elasticity is high, efforts are made to
meet it since it is a solvent demand
(i.e. people can pay cash down for
what they need), and generates profits.
Indeed, efforts are even made to
increase this elasticity of demand, so
that the rich are "obliged" to consume
more and more, while the poor are
forced to eat less, since their low
purchasing power pushes them out
of the market.
Poor harvests due to bad weather
have further complicated the problem,
aggravating the unstable situation
caused by the fall in reserves.
Despite warnings, the cereal short¬
age caught the world unawares. It
disturbed a food market already
rocked by inflation, forcing up prices
and stoking the fires already smoul¬
dering in other sectors of the world
economy. The oil producing countries,
which are major grain importers,
immediately agreed to readjust their
prices in order to bring them into line
with the new cereal prices; to keep in
step, all States possessing non¬
renewable raw material reserves
raised their prices too.
In a chaotic global economic situa¬
tion with one crisis leading to another
and an existing paradox sparking off

a new one, it soon became clear that
the humble cereal was an instrument
of immense strategic importance. The
wheatsheaf thus is taking on the
aspect of a weapon of economic
warfare. We can only hope it never
comes to be used as such.
Suppose an imaginary futurologist
had tried his hand at forecasting in the
days when men lived by hunting and
food-gathering. His inability to foresee
the birth and expansion of agriculture
would have led him to paint a very
gloomy picture of what lay in store
for predatory man.
He would have been alive to the
dangers inherent in large numbers
from his observation of the ecological
havoc wrought by nomad hordes on
ever larger expanses of land, and he
would have witnessed the tensions
and conflicts caused between neigh¬
bouring tribes because of the growing
numbers of mouths they had to feed.
So he would almost certainly have
predicted (or even recommended) inter¬
tribal warfare, while at the same time
fearing a drift into decadence.
At that time neither observation of
everyday life nor exercise of the
imagination could have led him to take
the more open and flexible view of
things which is now made possible
by sifting through history and com¬
paring various past situations with our
own.
The time is surely ripe for us to lay
the foundations of a genuine science

IS THERE
A SOLUTION
TO THE WORLD
FOOD CRISIS ?
by SayedAhmed Marei
OVER six months have now elaps¬
ed since the World Food Con¬
ference met in Rome, on November 5,
1974. Many of us are wondering
what next?
The present world food crisis,
originating from a combination of
longer term, deep-seated problems,
and temporary setbacks, suddenly
emerged in a pronounced form in 1972
due to the disastrous weather con¬
ditions in that year.
World output of food declined. In
particular, world output of cereals
(wheat, coarse grains and rice) fell by
a large amount 33 million tons. This
coincided with a number of recent
events which compounded the effects
on prices, trade and payments.
Examples of these events are: the
unprecedented boom in economic
activity in the developed countries,
leading to a high demand for com¬
modities, and the worldwide inflation-
SAYED AHMED MAREI. Chairman of the
People's Assembly of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, was Secretary-General of the U.N. World
Food Conference, held in Rome in November
1974. A leading authority on farming, he was
the architect of Egypt's far-reaching land reform
programmes in the 1950s. He has held key
posts in the Egyptian government, notably as
Minister for Agriculture and Agrarian Reform
(1958-1961) and as Deputy Prime Minister for
Agriculture and Irrigation (1969-1972).
ary forces accentuated by monetary
instability and speculative activities.
Add to these, two other factors fer¬
tilizers and energy which burst onto
the scene in 1973.
True, production shortfall has charac¬
terized the fertilizer market since the
end of 1971, leading to high prices and
physical shortage, but the problem
worsened with the rise in petroleum
prices in late 1973 (which increased
the cost of fuel in agriculture) and
the shortage and high prices of raw
materials for fertilizer manufacture.
But these are only the recent causes
of the worsening food situation. Of
greater concern are the deep-rooted
causes dominating many parts of the
developing countries.
The major problem facing the dev¬
eloping countries, in spite of the
remarkable expansion of their agri¬
cultural output in the 1950s and
1960s, lay in the increased rate of
demand3.5 per centdue to faster
population growth. Although the
degree of imbalance varies from
country to country and from region to
region, in the majority of developing
countries the agricultural shortfall has
become a grave impediment to the
achievement of overall development.
Failure of food production means
a rise in the developing countries'
cereal imports, which consequently
results in large food import bills. In
the past, the burden of payment was
mitigated by the availability of food
aid, which in the 1960s ranged between
30 per cent and 45 per cent of total
food imports. But with the recent
running down of cereal stocks, the
volume of food aid has drastically
diminished.
There have been parallel disap¬
pointments in development assistance
whose volume has fallen far short of
the targets set up in several inter¬
governmental assemblies. Although in
monetary terms the annual value of
development assistance doubled bet¬
ween 1961 and 1972, in real terms the
increase was marginal.
Another imbalance is the mal¬
distribution of food within countries,
giving rise to the vital issue of the
nutritional adequacy of available
supplies. Malnutrition affects some
460 million people in the developing
world. Large numbers of people lack
adequate and appropriate food diets
resulting in adverse effects on their
health, their development and their
ability to learn and work for their basic
livelihood.
In these countries, the problem is
not only that of physical privation of
human beings, but the fact that such
situations usually lead to violence and
strife at a time when overconsumption
among the affluent peoples is impair¬
ing their health.

We travel together,

spaceship, dependent on
its vulnerable reserves
of air and soil... We

miserable, half confident,
half despairing, half
slave to the ancient
enemies of man, half

no crew can travel safely
with such vast
contradictions. On their
resolution depends
the survival of us all.

Left, from two verses of the Koran,

It is in such a world, with great
wealth and affluence enjoyed by only
one-third of its population, that the
2300-year-old words of the Greek
Cynic philosopher Diogenes come
back to haunt us. When asked for
the proper time to eat, he responded,
in his own practical manner: "If a
rich man, when you will; if a poor man,
when you can."
However, the situation may not look
so bleak if we remember the enormous
reservoir of production potentialities
in the developing nations that are still
untapped.
Vast areas of arable land in Latin
America and Asia are still unexploited.
This is due to many well-known causes
such as inaccessibility, insufficient
technology, prevalence of infestations
and undeveloped water resources.
Progressive removal of these ob¬
stacles, though costly, is technically
foreseeable.
In livestock production there is also
considerable potential for growth.
This could be done through improving
animal health conditions, upgrading
herd quality and expanding the feed
base.
The same goes for fertilizers, pesti¬
cides and herbicides, and improved
quality seed. The per hectare use of
these inputs remains on average low
and thus the full potentialities of soils,
irrigation water, and high-yielding seed
varieties will not be realized. Indeed,
the growth of future production lies in
opportunities to increase yields per
unit of land or per animal. Therefore,
there is need for further investment in
research, extension and credit supplies.
Another area ready for further
exploitation is the fish industry. Devel¬
opment of aquaculture needs to be
given more priority in the future.
Most important of all are the human
resources. Here is an immense
potential waiting to be released,
organized, and generously provided
with the needed technological know-
how and tools of production.
The foregoing analysis concentrated
on the obstacles and difficulties
concerning which action is needed if
new and more satisfactory trends are
to be established. It also emphasized
the fact that many developing countries
have the potential to produce more
food. But to do this one needs
massive investments, more appropriate
techniques, better management, and
improved institutions. Moreover, inter¬
national assistance is called for.
It is with this background knowledge
that we went to the World Food Con¬
ference in Rome last November. The
main purpose of the meeting was to
find solutions to the food problem in
order to achieve freedom from hunger
in the world of tomorrow.
In my judgement, the first ac
complishment of the Conference was
the widespread interest and concern
generated regarding hunger and mal¬
nutrition. Whatever differences of
viewpoints existed, everyone re¬
cognized that we live in an age of
interdependence, and that no country
can exist in isolation.
Resolutions were adopted dealing
with all important aspects of food
production, distribution, nutrition, re¬
serves and food aid. But they were
not left at that. Provisions were made
for the assignment of each subject to
a follow-up organization.
The main follow-up mechanism,
established to co-ordinate efforts on
these fronts by all U.N. agencies in
the agricultural field, is the World Food
Council approved by the U.N. Gen¬
eral Assembly on January 30, 1975.
For this Council to implement the
various resolutions, it should have
enough political authority and support.
The Council will be serviced within
the framework of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization and will thus
not add to the burden of other U.N.
agencies.
The Conference also approved a
recommendation for the establishment
of an International Fund for Agri¬
cultural Development (IFAD) to channel
investment towards improving agri¬
culture in the developing countries.

t rests upon the joint efforts and good¬
will of the developed and oil-producing
countries.
Another major initiative was the
agreement to institute an international
undertaking on world food security.
This is obviously a long-term plan to
co-ordinate stock-holding policies for
basic foods (mainly cereals) in order
to avert the kind of fluctuations in
world stocks that lead to dangerous
food shortages. The undertaking is to
be supported by a worldwide infor¬
mation system of food production and
supply.
Apart from proposals for the main
follow-up institutions, the Conference
also agreed on a number of resol¬
utions dealing with specific aspects
of the world's food problem and agri¬
cultural development. These included
strengthening rural development, in¬
creasing research and training, man¬
agement of water resources, pest
control and seed production.
In addition, resolutions urged inter
national organizations and bilateral aid
agencies to intensify efforts to meet
the critical needs of developing
countries for supplies of fertilizers
and to support, both materially and
financially, the recently established
International Fertilizer Supply Scheme.
Finally, the Conference approved a
forward planning strategy for food aid.
There was general agreement that at
least 10 million tons of grain be
guaranteed for food aid every year.
It must be remembered that however
vigorous the efforts may be to in¬
crease agricultural output, the results
will only appear after a lapse of time.
Meanwhile, food aid and import financ¬
ing problems are to be dealt with as
matters of urgency and deserve care¬
ful consideration in the interim period.
This leads us to the inevitable and
vital issue of financing food supplies.
It is obvious that the task of accelerat¬
ing the expansion of production will
require investment on a massive scale.
But, however great the efforts
exerted by the developing countries,

a significant part of the financing will
have to be provided by the developed
and oil-producing countries either
directly or through some international
institution. Economic history might
give an insight. Could it be that we
need something equivalent to the
Marshall Plan of the late 1940s?
The Marshall Plan of 1947, named
after its initiator, the then U.S.
Secretary of State, George C. Marsh¬
all, aimed at helping European econ¬
omies recover after the devastation of
World War II. In Europe there was
need to rebuild, to develop, and to
make up for scarcities. The news¬
papers of those days often referred
to the "dollar shortage" or "dollar
gap". Technically, this meant that the
demand for dollars from outside
America, to finance needed imports,
was much greater than the supply of
such dollars to those countries.
The Marshall Plan, with far-sighted¬
ness and sound economic reasoning,
stated that aid to Europe should not
be "on a piecemeal basis as various

JAMAICA
Keble Munn, Minister of Agriculture:
"Developing countries are handicapped in increas¬
ing their food production by the high cost of fertilizers
and machinery, largely imported from the rich nations.
Agricultural production for export in the developing
countries, on the other hand, is for the most part
unprofitable and unstable.
"The small farmer equates agriculture with poverty
and seeks desperately to find ways of leaving the
land. Farmers must be given concrete evidence that
farming is a profitable enterprise."
BANGLADESH
Abdus Samad Azad, Minister for Agriculture,
Local Government, Rural Development and
Co-operatives :
"The people of Bangladesh, in common with the
peoples of many other newly-independent countries,
find themselves confronted with the equally monstrous
problems of food and shelter, hunger and malnutrition.
"It is gratifying to note that the world has come to
realize the enormity of the problem and that the
developed and the developing countries have got
together in a collective search for a solution to this
problem now threatening the survival of millions of
human beings.
"We have received valuable assistance. But the
needs are so wide-ranging, urgent and critical that
such assistance falls short."
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
Bohuslav Vecera, Minister of Agriculture
and Food :
"World land resources are sufficient to feed all,
even with a rising population. Developing countries
have great reservoirs of natural resources and man¬
power. But one cannot expect full success in agricul¬
tural production without deep modifications in the
social and economic structure."
ALGERIA
Layachi Yaker, Minister of Trade:
"Algeria calls for increased food production in all
developed countries. These countries have to replace
the idea of production for commercial marketing to
production for the needs of mankind. And the commit¬
ment of developed countries should not be confined
to foodstuffs alone; it should include all agricultural
inputs, such as fertilizer, pesticides and machinery."

crises develop" but "should provide
a cure rather than a mere palliative".
The Plan aimed at the development of
those countries by supporting needed
imports of equipment and supplies,
and encouraging internal measures to
promote financial stability.
Each country was to formulate a
plan for the four-year period 1948-
1951, proposing measures to in¬
crease production and reduce balance
of payments deficits. The plans were
to be reviewed and co-ordinated by
the Organization for European Econ¬
omic Co-operation and screened by
the U.S. Economic Co-operation
Administration.
This ensured that the U.S. would
provide only necessary assistance,
and gave it a measure of control over
the monetary and fiscal policies of the
participating countries. Over the
four-year period of the operation of
the European Recovery Program, the
U.S. extended $11.4 billion of aid to
Europe almost 90 per cent of which
was in the form of outright grants.
The result was encouraging. Sub¬
stantial expansion of European pro¬
duction was achieved. In 1951
production in Western Europe was
about 40 per cent greater than in 1938,
itself a record year.
There seems to be some similarity
between the period of the dollar
shortage of the late 1940s and what
today may be called the "petro-money
shortage". In the late 1940s it was
America which had greater liquidity
while Europe had a shortage. Today,
oil-exporting countries are generating
surplus funds while other countries,
especially the developing countries of
Asia and Africa, are taking the place
of Europe of the late 1940s.
Therefore, it would be a move in the
right direction if some sort of a
"Trustee" for these funds were to be
formed by a number of banks say,
15 headed by the World Bank. Its
function would be to channel funds
into development, reconstruction, and
elimination of scarcities. Funds would
flow in a regularized fashion, according
to documented needs of the different
countries, thus avoiding the inevitable
quarrels on who gets what.
This is just one possible way of
tackling this topical issue. But we
must remember that authorizing the
establishment of institutions and
passing resolutions will not grow more
wheat or feed more people. It all
depends on the willingness of govern¬
ments and the people themselves to
do what is necessary, if we are to live
in a better world a world where no
child shall ever go hungry again.

AT first sight, the growing cri¬
sis of World Hunger strikes
one as a problem of overwhelming
dimensions. Moreover, estimates of
the global food situation drawn up by
the Secretariat of the United Nations
World Food Conference in Rome, in
November 1974, seemed over-optim¬
istic, as I pointed out in a paper I
circulated at the conference.
The fact is that crop yield and pro¬
duction figures are provided by govern¬
ments, which prefer to publish stat-

or Death", by André Deutsch. London (1974).
istics that reflect favourably on their
management. Statisticians have told
me that in some cases governments
gave "upbeat" assessments. The
serious food shortages in the Indian
sub-continent in the autumn of 1974
were not readily "owned up" any more
than those in the Sahel in the winter
of 1972-1973.
The preliminary assessment of the
world food situation made for the
Rome conference (1) did, however,
concede that "there is no sign of any
drop in the percentage of the popu¬
lation estimated as undernourished. . .
It is estimated that in the Far East
alone more than 100,000 children go
blind each year due to vitamin A defi¬
ciency. . . Iron and folate [a vitamin
of the B complex] deficiency anae¬
mias are widely prevalent in developed
and developing countries and are the
cause of ill-health and result in a
decreased ability to lead an active
life. . .
"A comprehensive world review of
endemic goitre revealed that there
were 200 million people suffering from
the disease. . . which is usually accom¬
panied by endemic cretinism. . . Half

the children under five in developing
countries are inadequately nourished,
and for many this will inevitably lead
to premature death."
And of those who survive, how many
fail to attain normal brain growth
because of lack of proteins? Those in
the rich countries who oppose birth
control would like to see even unwant¬
ed children born. They forget that
children already alive are deprived of
their minimum needs, because of the
unequal distribution of the world's
produce and "our" overconsumption,
especially of meat.
"We" (the rich countries) gave the
countries of the Sahel the equivalent
of 600,000 tons of cereals and $150
million in 1973. Even so there was
still a shortage of about 400,000 tons
of cereals in the Sahel that year, result¬
ing in thousands of deaths.
In that same year, we fed our farm
animals (cattle, pigs, poultry and the
like) 400 million tons of grain (and
50 million tons of oil cake) a thousand
times as much food as was needed
in the Sahel. Since we dump into our
trash cans at least a tenth of the food
we buy, all we had to do was "throw
away" a little less and we would have
been able to provide what was needed.
The total annual income of the rich

countries in 1973 was estimated at
about $3,000 billion. So we gave
"our" poor not the biblical tithe (one-
tenth) but 1/20,000th of our income,
or 1/2,000th of the tithe.
The same year Togo's agricultural
marketing boards gave Togolese
cocoa, coffee and cotton growers
40 per cent of the revenue they had
earned from selling these products
abroad. The Togolese farmer thus
contributed 60 per cent of his gross
receipts to the country's budget: he
gave six times the tithe, or 12,000
times as much as we did.
Yet a number of the most urgent
measures for improving the nutritional
situation require only a modest out¬
lay, even a ridiculously small one in
some cases. In the case of children
suffering from serious protein defi¬
ciency, it would cost $20 a year to
provide a child under five with all the
additional proteins it needs for full
brain development. For 100 million
children it would cost $2 billion.
This seems an enormous sum, until
one realizes that expenditure on
advertising in the United States alone
is $20 billion a year, while world spend¬
ing on arms totals $300 billion (at
least), in other words, sums that are
respectively 10 and 150 times as
much as it would cost to save the
world's children from protein defi¬
ciency.
And then there is the incredible
amount of money spent on luxury
goods, such as our expensive auto¬
mobiles which the "élite" of the Third
World covet, because they want to
imitate us. Such spending is ruining
these countries. Armaments expendi¬
ture in the so-called underdeveloped
countries is rising twice as fast as
their domestic production. And we
rake off profits from these arms sales.
There is a whole range of measures
requiring so little expenditure that it
is hard to understand why they have
not been adopted so far. Take the
case of blindness caused by vitamin
A deficiency. The United Nations
World Food Conference, in its second
report (1) made use of statistics pro¬
vided by WHO to conclude that
"Considering that each child has to
be given two capsules (of vitamin A),
the total annual cost of protecting
100 million one-to-five-year-old chil¬
dren all over the world against the
risk of xerophthalmia [caused by

National and International Action, United Na¬
tions, 1974.

vitamin A deficiency] would be around
$3 million."
Three dollars to save a hundred
children! Leaving humanitarian con¬
siderations aside completely, the outlay
would be worthwhile in purely econ¬
omic terms considering what it costs
society to aid the blind when it
actually does do something for them.
Let us look at another problem.
According to the same U.N. report,
"injecting iodized oil gives protection
(from goitre) for periods ranging from
three to five years at a cost of 10 to
20 cents per head per year." As for
protection from iron and folate defi¬
ciencies, which threaten some 300 mil¬
lion people (women between the ages
of 15 and 45 and children from one to
five years old), "the. total annual cost
of the supplements would be around
$44 million." In other words, one
dollar to save more than six persons
from the effects of the worst forms
of anaemia.
The cost of combating intestinal
parasites (worms, amoebae or other
organisms) can also be evaluated: a
world-wide drive against them would
cost less than the campaign which
succeeded in considerably reducing
the incidence of malaria. Measures k

W fully launched in various parts of
Africa by WHO, FAO and other inter¬
national agencies, could be extended
to much wider areas, covering most of
Central Africa, with beneficial results
for human health and animal husbandry.
We have all these courses of action
open to us, but what is likely to happen
if the present trend continues, es¬
pecially in regard to the population ex¬
plosion? In the Club of Rome's second
report (1) M. Mesarovic and E. Pestel
picked out the most daunting case,
that of South Asia, from the Middle
East to the Philippines, with a popu¬
lation of 1.3 billion in 1973. At the
rate birth-control measures have been
introduced here in recent years, it will
take another half a century at least for
births and deaths to balance out at
zero population growth.
By thenIn the year 2025South
Asia's population, according to this
projection, will have reached 3.8 billion.
Assuming that as much fertilizer as
was used by developed nations in 1960
were to be available to South Asia and
that irrigation were developed and
grain varieties carefully selected,
South Asia would still need, according
to the authors of this report, 500 million
tons of grain a year.
My own estimate was a deficit
of between 300 and 400 million tons
a year. In any case the deficit will
be far more than the richer countries
could give or transport, even assuming
they display a generosity of which
there has been little sign so far.
(We shall soon see what the oil-
producing countries will do.)
And what if this part of Asia does
not receive so massive a volume of
"aid", which is as hypothetical as it is
costly? The authors of the Club of
Rome report say the level of nutritional
deficiencies would be such that as
many as 500 million children up to the
age of 15 years would die of hunger
alone in the next 50 years. The
disasters of recent years in the Sahel,
Ethiopia and Bangladesh would then
be a mere foretaste of far more
terrible and widespread famines to
come (2).
The time has come to ask ourselves
what can be done. Overpopulation
is threatening the very survival of the
human species. United Nations popu¬
lation experts today estimate that world
population will probably rise to be¬
tween 6.5 billion and 7.5 billion by the
year 2000. They "hope" the popu¬
lation will level off between 12 billion
and 14 billion towards the middle of the
next century. I say such projections
are misleading.
Let us take the U.N. experts' "lower
estimate" of 12 billion by 2050 as a
starting point for discussion. This
would imply that South Asia, where
a third of the world's people live today
and where the population is growing
faster than the world average (2.1 per
cent a year) will have more than
4 billion people. Here we are back
to the theory of vast shortages and
extraordinarily high child mortality
rates mentioned earlier. If births are
not curbed more rapidly, then equi¬
librium will be achieved by an
increasingly swift rise in mortality rates.
An academic assumption? No, for
already between 50,000 and 300,000
persons were estimated to have starved
to death between August 1974 and the
end of the year in two Bangladesh
provinces alone, Rangpur and Dinajpur,
following severe floods.
These deaths were only one conse¬
quence of famine. The provinces'
smallest landowners, with "less than
4,000 square metres" of rice-paddy,
had to sell all their plots of land in
order to survive. The richer peasants,
the "kulaks", bought up the land at
give-away prices, queuing overnight
outside land registry offices and buying
tax stamps on the black market so as
not to miss a "good bargain".
This brings us to the great hopes of
vanquishing world hunger which were
raised by the Green Revolution,
especially in the years 1969-1971,
when the cultivation of high-yield rice
and wheat strains was extended (3).
Wheat, on the whole, proved to be
a success in India, where production
doubled in seven to eight years,
especially in the north west (Punjab,
Haryana). But this was partly at the
expense of legumes [beans, soybeans,
etc.] production which fell from
26 kilogrammes a head annually in
1956-1961 to 18.7 kilogrammes in 1971-
1973, which meant a proportionate
decrease in precious proteins.
Rice production has increased much
less than that of wheat, for while most
rice fields continue to be dependent
solely on rain, the new rice strains
require a strictly regular supply of
water. Only the big landowner
groups, with access to official credits,
have succeeded in installing the
necessary irrigation and drainage fa¬
cilities and in procuring fertilizer, pesti¬
cides and so on. Some of them have
made so much money that they have
bought tens of thousands of tractors
and thousands of combine harvesters,
all of which helps to increase rural
unemployment.
Studies by the United Nations
Research Institute for Social Develop¬
ment, in Geneva, have shown that this
"Green Revolution" in very many cases
aggravated social inequalities and
increased underemployment. If all
the poorer peasant farmers are to
benefit from the Green Revolution, they
must be freed from the clutches of the
many parasites battening on them.
Though laws frequently limit land
dues to a quarter of the harvest, many

VILLAGE
ARTISTS
OF BALI
During the last 15 years, a distinctive
style of popular painting has been
developed by young artists in two
villages on the Indonesian island of
Bali. Like children the world over,
those in the villages of Penestanan
Kadja and Penestanan Kelod
liked to draw and paint. But whereas
almost everywhere else these Interests
fade at adolescence, in Penestanan they
have continued to develop. The story of
the village painters of Penestanan
began in the early 1960s, when a Dutch
painter, Arie Smit, who lived in the
vicinity, gave a young village boy some
paper and paints. Soon Arie Smit was
surrounded by a group of enthusiastic
and promising painters, aged between
11 and 15, who were spontaneously
rediscovering a purely Balinese style
of painting. Encouraged to express
themselves freely, they began to
paint everything they saw around them :
people, animals, trees and buildings.
Since then they have grown up and
become farmers, but they still paint,
although much of their time is
taken up by their work in the rice
fields and other village activities.
Many of their children have
followed in their footsteps to form a
new generation of artists. Now in great
demand, their works depict the bustle
of life in Bali's villages, where the
hot and humid climate,
the fertile soil and the skill of the
farmers combine to produce a variety of
abundant crops. Our colour
reproductions of three of their
paintings depict villagers at work
in terraced rice-fields dominated by
rows of coconut palms, tending their
fruit and vegetable plantations,
rearing cows and ducks, and fishing in
irrigation channels (centre double
page) ; religious celebrations with
puppet theatres where events from the
Ramayana and Mahabharata Hindu
epics are re-enacted (opposite page);
and villagers enjoying traditional games
(page 22). Executed in oils on
white cotton cloth, these colourful
paintings are notable for their
firm outlines and intricate detail.
The painters of Penestanan excel in
capturing, in its myriad aspects,
the joyful spirit of village life,
and the festive pageantry
and living culture of Bali.

owners ask for and easily obtain,
because of an overabundance of share
croppers, half the harvest in return
for just a bare field. Loans from credit
co-operatives are not readily available
for small farmers, and loan sharks
often charge an annual interest rate
of 75 per cent.
Many civil servants in distributing
out'ets "lose" some of the fertilizer
it is their job to allocate: this fertilizer
turns up on the black market and the
officials get a percentage of the profits.
The trader, who is often a moneylender
and landowner as well, buys up grain
harvests outside the market. He later
sells them at high prices, when sup
plies are scarce, sometimes to the very
farmers who had been forced to sell
their crops to him a few months earlier
to pay off their debts.
Hunger, then, is not just a technical
problem. The high cost of fertilizer
(quantities of which we waste on our
lawns) and fuel is indeed a major ob¬
stacle, but hunger will be vanquished
only when farmers are finally rid of all
those who exploit them; only if they
learn to read and write, become
socially and politically educated, and
are motivated to organize themselves
and defend their interests. So that, in
other words, "they may rely above all
on their own efforts and resources,"
as the Chinese put it.
The struggle against hunger there¬
fore calls for a number of preliminary
economic and social and hence, poli¬
tical changes. So long as power is
left in the hands of village bosses,
there can be no hope of organizing
co-operatives providing real benefits
to all farmers, nor of mobilizing them
to carry out irrigation or other basic
improvements for farming progress.
The wealthy countries can help, of
course, and first of all by ceasing to
exploit the Third World.

VOICES FROM FIVE CONTINENTS. (Continued from page 15)
MEXICO
President Luis Echeverría Alvarez :
"The consumer and waste society has upset thé
essential priorities of human development. The famine
that today is paralyzing the activities of entire nations
has been manufactured with the same detachment as
that employed in the construction of the atomic bomb.
The progressive transformation of cereals and grains
into meat that makes over-consumption of meat in
certain affluent areas of the world possible, destroys
the possibility of a sufficient amount of protein in
other parts of the world.
"A large part of one-crop agriculture in the Third
World is established within the specific sphere of the
needs of certain empires or multinational companies.
The consequence of this has been ecological imba¬
lance, erosion and the annual abandonment of hun¬
dreds of thousands of hectares in favour of continuing
each year with a gigantic operation of geographic
devastation.
"We propose a World Food Plan which will
designate crop areas, make collective action possible,
establish the bases for regulating the use of fertilizers,
seeds and water, suggest new crops or new types of
agricultural production and also provide true universal
education as regards the value of food and the
importance of protein in development."
SENEGAL
Adrien Senghor, Minister of Rural Development
and Water Resources :
"There is still hope that a world seemingly dominated
by egoism, with the 'haves' wasting grains for feeding
their animals. . . will be able tc unite in the face of
threatened famine.
"Immediate measures should be taken for the estab¬
lishment of food stocks, particularly grains and pro¬
teins, in order to prevent crises such as those recently
witnessed and still rampant, particularly in the Sahel.
These stocks must be placed at strategic points near
famine areas. The international community should
urgently finance the necessary installations."
PHILIPPINES
Carlos P. Romulo, Secretary of Foreign Affairs:
"It is no use, it is indeed shameful and degrading
to wait for the developed countries to come to the
rescue every time we come to the brink of starvation.
Of course, when millions are faced with misery, offers
of assistance must be welcomed, as demonstrations
of human solidarity. But we are not helpless we
must help ourselves."
MAURITIUS
VENEZUELA Satcam Boolell, Minister of Agriculture:
President Carlos Andrés Peréz :
"World hunger is not the result of the recent petro¬
leum crisis. During the last 50 years, when the price
of petroleum was insignificant, the problem of hungry
and undernourished people has co-existed with the
indifference of those countries who exploited their
resources and labour.
"A drastic revision is needed in the present terms
of international trade that favour the industrial coun¬
tries and discriminate harshly against the countries
producing raw materials."
"If you want to increase food production in the
developing countries, the necessary facilities for which
we have been asking for decades now must be
provided. The constraints which lie in our way should
be removed or mitigated. What are these constraints?
Shortage and high cost of fertilizers, high cost of
pesticides, high cost of farm machinery, lack of trained
personnel, lack of finance and, most important of all,
of a reasonable level of income for the farmers. This
can only be achieved by guaranteed and stable mar¬
kets and reasonable prices for farm products."

of malnutrition

COLUTHUR GOPALAN, Indian doctor and
nutritionist, is Director- General of the Indian
Council of Medical Research. Director of the
National Institute of Nutrition. In Hyderabad, for
many years, he is first Vice-President of the
International Union of Nutritional Sciences. A
fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and
the Indian Academy of Medical Sciences, he
has published over 170 research papers on
various aspects of nutrition. He is a member
of the nutrition experts' panel of WHO and FA O.
ALNUTRITION is one of the
most important public health
problems in many countries today. In
the developing countries, deficiency
diseases due to inadequate nutrition
continue to be widespread.
Protein-calorie malnutrition, vitamin
A deficiency, anaemia and ailments due
to a deficiency of vitamin B complex
are the most commonly encountered
diseases. While protein-calorie mal¬
nutrition and vitamin A deficiency are
predominantly diseases of young child¬
ren, particularly of pre-school age,
anaemia ¡s a problem affecting all sec¬
tions of the population, though it is
most severe among women of child-
bearing age.
Protein-calorie malnutrition occurs
in large numbers of pre-school children
in most developing countries. Judged
by the occurrence of the most severe
forms of the disease like kwashiorkor
and marasmus, the incidence is bet¬
ween 0.5 and 5.0 per cent in children
between the ages of 1-5 years in poor
communities. On the other hand,
judged by the number of children who
suffer from deficient growth, which is
the feature of the mild and moderate
forms of the disease, the problem is
indeed a formidable one 60 to 70 per
cent of poor children showing signs
of growth retardation.
It may, however, be debated whether
mild and moderate degrees of growth
failure really constitute protein-calorie
malnutrition. The functional signifi¬
cance of varying degrees of growth
retardation is now under intensive in¬
vestigation, and these data may be
expected to provide reliable informa¬
tion on the real extent of the problem
of protein-calorie malnutrition in young
children.
Severe forms of protein-calorie mal¬
nutrition carry with them a high rate
of mortality. Even with hospitalization
and the best medical care, 10 to 15
per cent of all children suffering from
kwashiorkor and marasmus do not sur¬
vive. A very high proportion of child¬
ren living in rural areas cannot and
do not get such medical attention and
the mortality rate for them is several
times higher.
As a result of kwashiorkor alone,
several million children in the world

Even when they survive, millions of children
suffer irreversible damage to brain and body
do not live beyond the age of five.
High as this figure is, mortality due to
malnutrition computed ' on this basis
would be a gross underestimate,
because in a large number of children
who die of other diseases like tuber¬
culosis, measles, smallpox, chicken-pox
and gastro-intestinal infections, malnu¬
trition is not only an underlying cause
for the development of the disease, but
also adversely modifies its course.
But for their malnutrition, they might
not have contracted the disease, and
even if they had, they would not have
died.
In many developing countries, 30 to
40 per cent of deaths occur in children
below the age of 5, and mortality rates
of very young children are as high as
18 to 30 per 1,000. In the developed
countries, where malnutrition does not
exist, corresponding figures are 7 per
cent and less than 1 per 1,000.

This high mortality rate among pre¬
school children has several serious
repercussions. In countries where
there is a high death rate among child¬
ren, the age structure of the population
shows a high proportion of youth.
Nearly 15 per cent of the population
in developing countries is below 5
years of age as compared to between
7 and 10 per cent in the developed
countries, and this group constitutes a
high risk group from the nutritional
point of view.
A vicious circle of malnutrition lead¬
ing to high death rates, which, in turn,
motivates large families, is also set up.
In rural families with limited means the
nutrition of young children is influenced
to a considerable extent by family
size.
Almost 70 per cent of the most sev¬
ere forms of protein-calorie malnutrition
seen in hospital are among the fourth
or subsequent children in a family,
even though 70 per cent of all children
receiving medical attention in hospital
are the earlier born ones. Incidence of
other nutritional deficiency symptoms
is also higher in later born children.
It has been suggested on the basis
of these observations than even under
existing social and economic condi¬
tions, a considerable impact can be
made on the extent of severe malnutri¬
tion, by simply restricting the number
of children in poor families to three
or less.
In most countries of the world, total
food production has shown a progres¬
sive increase during the last decade,
and in some spectacular gains have
been made. In spite of this, the avail¬
ability of food per person has re¬
mained essentially unaltered, primarily
because of the rise in population.
As a result, the nutritional situation
of the poorer sections of the population
has shown little change, and the pro¬
portion of the population with nutritio¬
nal deficiency has remained constant.
Malnutrition has actually increased, .
because of the population increase. It P

is obvious, therefore, that limitation of
population growth is one of the most
important and urgent aspects in the
planning of nutritional improvement in
most developing countries.
In several countries, where intense
efforts are being made to limit family
size, family planning programmes have
failed to make the necessary impact.
Studies have shown that one of the
important reasons why rural women
refuse to accept family planning is the
high mortality rate, since children con¬
tinue to be considered as social
security for parents in their old age.
A comprehensive child care pro¬
gramme, of which nutrition must cons¬
titute an important part, may, therefore,
be expected to cut the vicious circle.
Of equal or greater concern today
is the state of those who survive the
moderate and severe forms of malnu¬
trition. As a result of improved treat¬
ment, a large number of children
suffering from kwashiorkor can now be
saved, but recent studies have indi¬
cated that malnutrition and under¬
nutrition in early years of life are
associated with long-term effects.
Evidence suggests that such children
fail to fully express their genetic poten¬
tial for physical growth in later life
and, even more important, that they
emerge from malnutrition with impaired
ability to learn and understand.
Assessment of intellectual ability in
children who had once suffered from
kwashiorkor and in children who are
chronically undernourished has shown
that not only do they perform less
well in intelligence tests, but also that
they have lower intersensory skills
which are essential for primary learn¬
ing. Studies on the biochemical com¬
position of brains of children who have
died of kwashiorkor and marasmus
have shown alterations, though the
functional significance of these chan¬
ges has yet to be fully understood.
It is, however, now being increasing¬
ly recognized that non-nutritional fac¬
tors may have an equally important role
to play in the poor mental development
seen in malnourished children. The
psychological environment in which the
child grows and the social stimulation
which it receives during its early
formative years appear to be particu¬
larly important. Even these, however,
may be indirectly related to malnutri¬
tion, since a malnourished, sick child
interacts poorly with its environment.
For many years it was believed that
the major factor underlying widespread
protein-calorie malnutrition in children
was lack of protein in the diet a belief
that greatly influenced thinking and
planning on the problem. Efforts were
directed to develop "protein concen¬
trates" to bridge this "protein gap".
Studies in recent years from several
parts of the world have shown, how¬
ever, that in the current o"iets of pre¬
school children, the primary bottleneck
is not protein, but calories. For dietary
factors involved in malnutrition appear
to be related more to total intake, and
hence to energy (calories) than to the
amount of protein supplied by the diet.
Therefore the problem of protein
malnutrition is secondary to inadequate
calorie intake.
What one is dealing with is more
a "food gap" (a problem of quantity)
than a protein gap, (a problem of
quality) and an appreciation of this
fact is essential in formulating proper
control and preventive measures.
Anaemia of nutritional origin is found
in many parts of the world and is a
major health problem. Though it is
more frequently encountered in dev¬
eloping countries and appears to be
more widespread among the poorer
sections of the population, affluent
groups are not free from the disease.

Nurturing
tomorrow's
farmers
As part of its latest five-year
development plan, the Indian
Government has adopted a
far-reaching national policy for
children to improve child welfare
and nutrition. Special attention
is being devoted to the needs of
India's 115 million children under six,
the group most vulnerable to
malnutrition. Left, secondary
school-children at work in the fields
at a government agricultural school
near Madras, in Tamil Nadu
(formerly the State of Madras)
are taught to apply modern ideas
in farming, while using traditional
tools. Right, chicken rearing
to provide extra protein, a project
launched near Vellore by the Tamil
Nadu Ministry of Agriculture
under the auspices of UNICEF.
Iron deficiency appears to be by far
the commonest cause of nutritional
anaemias, although in many instances
folate deficiency (a vitamin B complex
factor) is an additional cause.
Anaemia occurs most often in women
of child-bearing age. Anaemia has
been recognized, in fact, as one of
the most frequent and serious compli¬
cations during pregnancy. Depending
upon the nutritional quality of the habi¬
tual diets and availability and utilization
of antenantal services and medical
care, between 20 and 80 per cent of
pregnant women in different parts of
the world are anaemic during the last
three months of pregnancy. The point
reached in the pregnancy and the
number of previous pregnancies are
two well-recognized factors which
influence the incidence of anaemia
during pregnancy.
Pregnancy anaemia plays a very
important role in maternal mortality and
disease; it also considerably influences
infant mortality and disease. Between
10 and 20 per cent of all maternal
deaths in India are believed to be
directly attributable to anaemia. Anae¬
mic pregnant women are also more
vulnerable to disease. Genito-urinary
infections during pregnancy, still
births, premature births and puerperal
infections are found to be several
times higher in women who are
anaemic.
Maternal anaemia also appears to
be related to the birth weight of a child.
There is a well-established social and
economic gradient in the birth weight
of infants, but in the low income groups
it has been reported that the mean
birth weight of full-term infants born
to mothers with severe anaemia is
over 500 grammes less than the mean
birth weight of infants born to non-
anaemic mothers.
In a great majority of such infants,
birth weights were below 2.2 kg.
Neo-natal and peri-natal mortality are
known to rise steeply as birth weight
falls, and the role of maternal anaemia
in infant mortality thus becomes ob¬
vious. Added to this is the contribu¬
tion of anaemia to prematurity, with
consequent low birth weight.
Anaemia is also a widespread prob¬
lem in children below the age of 5
in many parts of the world. In many
children, there are no clinical symp¬
toms when the anaemia is mild or
moderate. Hence it has been some¬
times argued that such children may
not be under any handicap. Recent
studies have, however, suggested that
iron deficiency and iron deficiency
anaemia may adversely affect host
defence mechanisms against infection.
Increased mortality and morbidity from
infectious diseases have, in fact, been
reported in anaemic children. The
mechanism by which iron deficiency
anaemia may lower the host defence
has not as yet been fully understood.
In most countries, widespread mal¬
nutrition is largely the result of poverty.
However, the effects of inadequate
dietary intakes are often considerably
exaggerated by infections and infesta¬
tions arising from poor environmental
sanitation and poor personal hygiene.
Ignorance, superstition and wrong
food habits are additional contributory
factors. Under these circumstances,
it must be recognized that lasting
improvement in the nutritional status
of poor communities is unlikely to be
achieved through nutrition programmes
alone, though this is a pre-requisite.
Nutrition programmes have to be
coupled with measures seemingly unre¬
lated to nutrition, such as the improve¬
ment of the physical environment, a
protected water supply, immunisation
programmes and improvements in the
general level of education.

Northeast Brazil
fights hidden hunger
by Nelson Chaves

O
THE agonizing problem of hunger
is nothing new. History records
some terrible famines in the past
which virtually wiped out whole
peoples. Nowadays, thanks to rapid
transport and modern communications
media, acute crises of mass starvation
are almost always averted by aid from
more fortunate countries. Neverthe¬
less, hidden hunger continues to be
an endemic plague in many parts of
the world.
Paradoxically this situation has
grown worse despite the advances of
modern science and technology. Its
causes are multiple and varied. Some
are ecological, others social or econ¬
omic especially the population ex¬
plosion with its appalling prospects
and some political.
Endemic hunger and malnutrition are
the twin fruits of poverty. Together
with ignorance, lack of elementary
sanitation, infection and crowded living
conditions, they primarily afflict the
most vulnerable groups of the popu¬
lation: pregnant and nursing women,
babies, pre-school and school-age
children and adolescents.
The scourge of hunger takes what
many regard as a shamefully heavy toll
NELSON CHAVES, of Brazil, is professor of
physiology at the faculty of medicine of the
Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil) and
scientific adviser to the University's Institute of
Nutrition.
in the Latin American countries, parti¬
cularly those in the tropical zones.
Premature death is widespread in the
less-developed nations, and its dam¬
aging effect on their social and econ¬
omic structure runs deep.
In regions where ecological con¬
ditions are unfavourable, the situation
is getting worse as the gap between
the developed and the developing
world grows wider. As Addeke H.
Boerma, Director-General of FAO, so
aptly put it: "Mankind lives on a single
earth, but in two different worlds."
One nutrition expert, J.M. Bengoa,
claims that at present a million children
in Latin America suffer from serious
malnutrition, and 10 million from less
acute malnutrition. Comparable fig¬
ures for Africa are 3 million and
16 million respectively, and for Asia
6 million and 64 million.
Taking the world as a whole, there
are 10 million children in imminent
danger of death, and even if they were
to be given the attention they need,
a third of them would still die.
Bengoa adds that the condition of the
90 million children suffering from
various forms of less serious mal¬
nutrition could suddenly become worse
as a result of infections.
If the food now available were
distributed equitably, says Bengoa,
not a single child would be under¬
nourished. There is enough food for
everyone in the world but it is not
distributed according to need.
Endemic malnutrition, widespread in
Recife and other parts of Northeast
Brazil, has slowly been brought into
prominence through various studies on
health and nutrition indicators, such as
the mortality rates of new-born babies,
of infants and of children from one to
four years of age, 'the frequency of
premature births, etc.
Anthropometric measurements es¬
pecially the weight-height ratio, cranial
circumference and skin wrinkling re¬
veal chronic undernourishment among
the most vulnerable groups of the
population referred to above. Mal¬
nutrition is an obstacle to the economic
and social development of this
vast area in Brazil covering some
1,548,000 km2 Gust over 18 per cent of
the entire national territory) with
28,675,000 inhabitants, or about 30 per
cent of Brazil's population.

<![CDATA[
Interdepartmental Committee on Nu¬
trition for National Development and
the Nutrition Institute of Brazil's
Federal University of Pernambuco
showed that there was a high degree
of malnutrition, particularly among the
low-income brackets, in the 15 cities
of the Brazilian Northeast selected for
the survey.
It disclosed inferior weight-height
ratios among children, calorie and
protein deficiency, too-early weaning,
premature ageing, vitamin deficiency,
tooth decay and many cases of
infestation by intestinal parasites. The
study also showed that the Northeast
does not produce sufficient food to
meet the needs of the population
adequately. The reason for this
shortage becomes clear when it is
pointed out that sugar and cacao
alone account for some 37 per cent of
the total food calorie production and
that they are the two main export
products.
Adonis Carvalho, a Brazilian special¬
ist, found fatty degeneration of the liver
due to malnutrition in children under
15 years of age, and other specialists
have found anatomical and pathological
signs of calorie and protein deficiencies
in children who have died in Recife,
capital of the State of Pernambuco.
Surveys carried out in seven munici¬
palities in the Mata-Sul area, based on
anthropometric measurements as well
as clinical and biochemical studies,
revealed first-, second-, and third-
degree malnutrition in some 70 per cent
of the children of pre-school age who
were examined. It was also found
that babies were weaned too early, a
practice that is customary in the
industrialized countries and is being
introduced in the developing countries.
At Agua Prêta, in the area where
sugar cane is grown and processed,
children of pre-school age showed a
high rate of malnutrition: 58 per cent
were suffering from first-degree mal¬
nutrition, and 18 per cent from second
and third, giving a total of 76 per cent
who were underfed in that age-group.
In Ribeiräo, another town in the
sugar-producing area, 50 per cent of
the children from 4 to 10 years of age
had calorie, and 49 per cent animal
protein, deficiencies as well as low
weight-height ratios. They were also
found to be suffering from deficiencies
of calcium, vitamins, riboflavin and
niacin; only iron was above the
recommended minimum, owing to the
large consumption of beans which are
a staple food of the local people.
The study, which covered three
different seasons of the year, also
showed that the sugar crop was an i
important factor in this situation as a I

result of unemployment and under¬
employment in the periods between
harvests.
The World Health Organization has
made thirteen surveys related to these
problems in Latin America, including
one in the city of Recife, through the
co-operation of the Institute of Child
Medicine of Pernambuco and the
Department of Paediatrics in the
Federal University of Pernambuco.
The population of Recife that year
(1969) was estimated at just over
1,060,000. Three over-populated sub¬
urbs Beberibe, Encruzilhada and Casa
Amarela totalling 365,680 inhabitants,
or 34 per cent of the city's population,
were selected for the study. Results
showed that 57 per cent of the deaths
of children under the age of five were
due to malnutrition and premature birth.
Undernourishment caused 46.2 per
cent of the deaths in Recife itself, and
premature birth 20.2 per cent, together
accounting for 66.4 per cent of the
deaths of children under five. It was
found that 26.8 per cent of the new¬
born babies were prematurely weaned,
having been breast-fed for only one
month. Recife had one of the highest
rates of infant mortality: deaths be¬
tween the ages of one and four,
deaths from diarrhoea or tuberculosis,
and deaths of new-born babies.
Studies have shown that a child is
born in Pernambuco every three
minutes, and that one child less than
a year old dies every fifteen minutes.
The infant mortality rate in Recife was
173.5 per thousand in 1973 (having
risen from 148 per 1,000 in 1970),
three times as high as in Sweden.
A study of 879 children aged one
to four living in Recife and other
places in Pernambuco State revealed
below-par anthropometric measure¬
ments and extensive third-degree mal¬
nutrition among children less than a
year old, though these diminished after
the age of three, presumably because
of the high mortality rate between
these two ages.
Studying the effects of malnutrition
on the development of the nervous
system, I discovered that in 109 chil¬
dren between the ages of 1 and 4
suffering from serious undernourish¬
ment in Ribeiräo, Gameleira and Agua
Prêta, the average Intelligence Quo¬
tient was 74.6, whereas a properly
nourished control group had an average
of 98.3.
All these fairly recent studies
indicate how precarious life is for the
greater' part of the population living
in the Mata de Pernambuco area and
in Recife, the State capital and one of
the centres of industrial development
in Brazil's Northeast. The city has
four universities, yet it is flagrantly
lacking in hospital and hygiene ser¬
vices, as well as basic sanitation
facilities.
In Recife and other parts of Brazil's
Northeast, over 50 per cent of children
under five die of malnutrition and
related causes which affect them both
in the foetal stage and during their
first years of life. Those who survive,
helped by a process of natural selec¬
tion and a better genetic make-up,
will in some cases possibly never
know any other school but the street.
Others, who come from somewhat less
underprivileged families and live in
less depressing surroundings, will
reach school age with physical' and
mental handicaps and will probably be
repeaters in the first three years of
school.
Unfortunately, although there has
been considerable discussion about
the problems of children from birth to
the age of six, little attention has
been paid to their plight in the
developing regions.

EXODUS
FROM HUNGER
Drought, crop failures and
unemployment in northeastern
Brazil, the vast "Nordeste", often
spark off mass migrations of
refugees towards the coast and
its towns. Whole families take
to the roads with a few
belongings (right) in search
of work, usually making for urban
areas where, as a result, slums
and shanty towns spring up like
this one (left) in Recife (capital
of Pernambuco State). The
Brazilian health authorities are
doing all they can to combat
the scourge of malnutrition which
afflicts millions of children
living in these wretched
conditions. The Nutrition
Institute of the Federal
University of Pernambuco, for
example, has set up and equipped
several Education Centres for
Improved Nutrition in various
parts of Pernambuco State.

> There are not enough pre-school
classes in these regions, and factories
have no crèches. Child-care edu¬
cation programmes for mothers are
few and far between, and premature
weaning is the rule, encouraged by the
availability of powdered milk, the
fashion of bottle-feeding and the
advice of some doctors, even though
it has serious nutritional, emotional and
affective consequences.
Recife reflects the current social and
economic situation throughout the
State, particularly in the Mata area
where the economy is based on the
sugar-cane crop grown on large
estates since colonial times and
originally associated with subsistence
farming, fruit-growing and livestock-
and poultry-raising.
When sugar became one of the
country's main export products, large
and small sugar-mills sprang up.
These rudimentary sugar-mills or
engenhos, mostly owned by the rural
aristocracy, provided greater distri¬
bution of income, but they have
gradually disappeared and are now
only crumbling vestiges of the past.
Sugar-cane planting has expanded
and pushed out other crops. This has
led to a monotonous diet of jerked
(dried) beef (called charque, from which
the English word "jerked" is derived),
manioc (cassava) flour, beans, sweet
potatoes and sugar, with very little
milk or dairy products, eggs, poultry,
fish, green vegetables or fruit.
Moreover, waste from the large mills
has polluted the rivers, killing off the
fish and shellfish, thereby depriving
the population of a major source of
animal protein. In addition, the soil
has become acidified and unsuitable
for many types of crop.
The unrestricted felling of trees has
also contributed to the impoverishment
of the soil and to its erosion, and has
reduced the total surface exposed to
photo-synthesis, which in turn has
altered the production cycles of car¬
bon, nitrogen and water.
The sugar-cane industry has devel¬
oped in Sao Paulo, where the land is
most fertile and least irregular in
contour, where industrial and agri¬
cultural technologies are most ad¬
vanced, and in whose vicinity the
largest consumer market in the country
is to be found. This development has
brought an economic crisis to the
sugar industry in the Northeast, forcing
many mills to close down.
The immediate consequences of this
have been unemployment and under¬
employment, and the emergence of a
semi-slave labour force with an
extremely low purchasing power. Mal¬
nutrition has increased, affecting whole
families and striking as usual the most
vulnerable groups, namely mothers and
children.
This economic situation has caused
people from the interior to flock to
Recife and nearby cities, as often
happens in the Sertäo area during
long droughts when masses of human
beings throng to the cities looking for
work.
The industrialization programme
sponsored in the region by the North¬
east Development Authority has not
been able to absorb the growing labour
force. Thus the rural population,
which in its own "habitat" was at least
able to produce something, has become
an idle body of consumers, thereby
creating new problems and compli¬
cating those that already existed.
Uncontrolled settlements around
Recife and other industrialized centres
in the Northeast have greatly raised
the population density, already high
because of the birth rate.
All this goes to prove that mal¬
nutrition in the Mata-Sul area of the
State of Pernambuco and in Recife has
gone hand in hand with the sugar
cycle. The nutritional situation was
actually much better during the colonial
period. For example, in 1801 the
authorities in the Pernambuco area de¬
creed that any sugar-mill owner or
producer of sugar-cane, cotton or other
industrial product had to plant manioc,
beans and maize as well. In 1811,
another decree granted exemption
from military service to anyone
producing food.
The struggle against malnutrition and
hunger calls for drastic reforms. This
means that rational, long-term pro¬
grammes for the most vulnerable
groups should be given top priority,
since the number of needy children in
Latin America and other less-devel¬
oped regions of the world continues
to grow.
Data from surveys carried out at
various places in the Northeast made
it possible to analyze the nutritional
problems of the region. On the basis
of these studies the Nutrition Institute
of the Federal University of Pernam¬
buco set up five Education Centres for
Improved Nutrition (at Ribeirâo, Game-
leira, Agua Prêta, Belem de Maria and
Usina Estreliana), and two others in
Recife.
A number of Brazilian experts have
described the initial results achieved
at one of these centres (Ribeirâo)
where the basic objectives were to
restore poorly-fed children to normal
health through proper diet, and also
to instruct their mothers in the basic
needs of nutrition.
Selected and classified according to
their degree of malnutrition, the chil¬
dren remained at the Centre for four
months, as day boarders, from Tuesday
to Saturday. They were given regular
clinical and anthropometric examin¬
ations and, when necessary, bio¬
chemical blood and urine tests. Tests
were also made for parasitical micro¬
organisms.
The children were put on a carefully
planned diet containing all their nu¬
tritional requirements. After a four
months' stay, they were discharged,
but the Centre continued to provide
them at home with a diet supplement
which satisfied one-third of their nu¬
tritional requirement.
Mothers took an active part in the
programme. They were taught how to
care for their offspring and were given
courses in hygiene, domestic science
and nutrition. This training enabled
them to continue the treatment that
their children had received at the
Centre, and also to give the benefit of
it to others at home.
The programme was run by doctors
and nutrition specialists. Its cost
was very low 25 or 30 times less
than comparable training in hospitals.
These centres were always attached
to a medical unit and took full ad¬
vantage of its services.
All these efforts represented a
concerted attempt to break out of the
vicious circle of malnutrition. The
results were most rewarding. Un¬
fortunately this pilot project, which was
meant to serve as a model for the
entire Northeast, was not continued
and could therefore not be fully
evaluated.
Special mention should also be made
of the work being done by the State
Foundation for the Welfare of Young
Children in Guanabara, particularly
the unit set up in Jacarepaguá.
All in all, there are better prospects
in store for the vulnerable groups in the
Northeast. For instance, the Amaury
de Madeiras Health Foundation, named
after a former Minister of Health, and
the Medical School of Pernambuco, are
working on an interesting programme
of child care for mothers, and this is
to be expanded. The National Food
and Nutrition Institute also intends to
launch a large-scale programme of
education centres for improved nu¬
trition in the near future.
In many parts of the world, vast
masses of the population are suffering
from hunger but do not understand its
causes, as in the case of other
problems such as pollution, violence,
water scarcity, juvenile delinquency.
Hence they neither fear hunger nor
are they sufficiently alive to the
need to co-operate in the search for
solutions to it. Others, greedy for
gain, do nothing practical to alleviate
the situation, lest they forfeit some of
their privileges.
It has been said that "infinite growth
is not possible on a finite planet." To
this we must add: especially if that
planet is being laid waste by the
constant and increasingly predatory
action of man.
Unless there is a radical change in
man's behaviour, it will be impossible
to eradicate hunger and malnutrition
from the earth, to protect the most
vulnerable groups, and to solve or at
least attenuate the serious problems
that are threatening the survival of
mankind.

VOICES FROM FIVE CONTINENTS... (Continued from page 23)
COLOMBIA
Luis Carlos Galan, Ambassador to Italy:
"The world is approaching the point where as many
people die daily of hunger or malnutrition as were
killed every 24 hours during World War II. The wield¬
ing of the world's economic power by a handful of
nations has made it impossible to guarantee the
majority of our fellow men even the most elementary
human rights.
"Colombia favours the establishment of a world
food security system, the reorganization of world food
commerce, increased agricultural production, and a
world agricultural information system.
"The oil producing nations have the opportunity to
prove before history that those who wield great power,
political or economic, can also use it for the benefit
of all mankind."
U.S.S.R.
Nicholas Rodionov, Vice-Minister of Foreign
Affairs:
"Some explain food problems in terms of the
population explosion but this is incorrect. Science in
theory and in practice has proved that given certain
social and economic conditions, there is great poten¬
tial for food production. Talking about a population
explosion appears to be an intentional attempt to veil
real causes, which are in the social, economic and
political fields.
"The solution to the problem of food supplies is
first of all dependent upon peace in the world. Vast
sums are spent on armaments and this undermines the
confidence of countries in each other. We endorse
the U.N. General Assembly resolution that permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council reduce their
arms spending by 10 per cent. The saving could be
applied to agricultural development in the Third World
countries."
CANADA
Allan J. MacEachen, Secretary of State for
External Affairs:
"In response to the situation of 'acute distress'
now confronting the food-deprived areas, Canada has
committed itself to supplying an average of 1,000,000
tons of food grains annually for each of the next three
years to the proposed minimum target for world aid
flows of 10 million tons a year."
POLAND
Kazimierz Barcikowski, Minister of Agriculture:
"The food problem was the result of wrong agricul¬
tural policies in vast parts of the world, motivated by
profits and the placing of obstacles to trade and the
rational exploitation of national resources. The first
aim must be to implement measures leading to a just
international division of labour."
SWEDEN
Svante Lundkvist, Minister of Agriculture:
"We are able to land on the moon on a predeter¬
mined spot and time but we fail every day in reach¬
ing thousands of hungry mouths on the earth with
the meal they need while there is still time."
BRAZIL
Alysson Paulinelli, Minister of Agriculture:
"Brazil cannot see how it is possible to stabilize
food prices at low levels if the products, equipment
and fertilizers developing countries buy on the inter¬
national market suffer a violent inflationary spiral."
PAKISTAN
Malik Khuda Bukhsh, Special Assistant for
Agriculture to the Prime Minister:
"The developing world will have to recognize that
the solution of its food problems lies in its own hands
and within its own countries. Agriculture will have
to be accorded the highest priority.
"Social and economic and aid policies of the 1960s
and 1970s have not permitted the developing world
to provide farmers with the knowledge, means and
incentives to increase production. How could the
producers of food be expected to feed the hungry
when they are themselves oppressed by a life of
misery, poverty and deprivation? We all talk about
farmers and endeavour to interpret their thinking and
aspirations. Has not the time come to start listening
to them at regional and international levels? Let the
feeders of the world get together to chart a new
strategy for the conquest of hunger."
TANZANIA
SUDAN
Abu el Gazim Mohammed Ibrahim, Minister of
Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources:
"Sudan is a big country that could contribute to
the battle against world food shortages. At present
only 9 per cent of the land that could be cultivated
is being farmed. But, like other developing coun¬
tries, we face major handicaps such as lack of ade¬
quate transport and finance."
J.J. Mungai, Minister for Agriculture:
"The biggest plight facing the Third World is that
our concerted effort to produce more is not a gua¬
rantee to increased earnings and capital for develop¬
ment investment. We in Tanzania have achieved
tremendous volume increases in all our major export
crops, but poor prices, compounded by higher prices
of imports from developed countries have been a
major constraint on our efforts to create a self-sustain¬
ing economy for our people." continued page 37

S.O.S. CHILDREN
In over 130 countries
UNICEF is giving millions of children
a chance of survival
by William Tracy
IAJOR advances in agricultural
technology in the recent past
held out the hope that the world was
maintaining a balance between food
production and demand as its total
population climbed toward four billion.
Then a series of natural disasters,
widespread crop failures and an econ¬
omic crisis which disrupted world fuel
and fertilizer supplies revealed how
precarious the balance had been and
tipped the scale firmly in the direction
of famine.
Pessimists, looking at this food
crisis, say the situation is so grim that
the world will soon face difficult moral
decisions as to who will eat and who
will starve. They discuss it in terms of
the "lifeboat" analogy, our overloaded
lifeboat being so low in the water that
the sea is about to pour over the sides
and send us to the bottom. The boat
can't hold everyone, they argue, so
some must be thrown overboard if the
rest are to survive.
Others are more optimistic. They
feel that the analogy is incorrect, or at
the least it is incomplete there are
- ships on the horizon.
WILLIAM TRACY, American writer and
photographer, is currently working for UNICEF
In New York.
Whichever interpretation is closest,
both groups agree that the situation is
extremely serious. In either case one
thing should be remembered. Con¬
siderable wisdom, and not just chivalry,
lies behind the old cry when ships face
disaster, "Women and children first!"
It is perhaps surprising that so many
persons, even government ministers
and international development and
relief experts, often tend to overlook
this, because it is based on two simple
facts so important to the survival and
prosperity of any society. Children
(along with pregnant or nursing
mothers) have special needs. Chil¬
dren have special potential. It is
the role of UNICEF, the United Nations
Children's Fund, to keep reminding the
world of these two principles and as
much as possible within its limited
means to act on them.
Children grow most rapidly during
their first three years. For this reason,
and also for their mental and behav¬
ioural development, young children
need different food from the rest of
the family. They must have more food
per kilogramme of body weight, it must
be prepared in a form they can easily
digest, and their diet must be richer
in proteins, as well as in vitamins and
minerals, than that of adults.
Children are especially vulnerable
during the transitional period of
weaning, before they are able to
handle adult foods, and because
mothers themselves are often under¬
nourished, weaning is usually com¬
pleted -long before the desirable age
of 18 to 24 months. Low birth weight,
closely related to the expectant
mother's calorie consumption, also
brings higher risks of illness or death.
Immunizations and a clean water
supply are vital because not only does
malnutrition make children more sus¬
ceptible to such diseases as diarrhoea,
respiratory infections, malaria and
measles but in a vicious circle chil¬
dren suffering from such diseases are
less able to make use of whatever
food they do obtain. In times of
emergency special problems exist
when children are separated from their
mothers. Also, during times of stress,
turmoil and agitation a crying child
actually uses up twice as many
calories as a contented baby.
Mere survival of the young child is
not enough. Malnutrition and disease
can leave indelible scars. The more
severe the deprivations and the earlier
they occur, the less likely it is that
their effects can ever be reversed and
that the children will grow up to be¬
come healthy and productive adults
rather than stunted burdens on society.
Also, because children like canaries
in a coal mine are so particularly
vulnerable, their condition serves as
a kind of early warning signal for the
rest of the population. When society
closely monitors the nutrition and
health of children and anticipates their
needs, the effort promotes the well-
being of all.
In developing countries, working to
help children is the surest way to enlist
the co-operation of villagers In promot¬
ing local development in many fields
and, until couples can be certain that
their children have enough food and
the basic health services needed to
ensure that they will live to adulthood,
family planning and the resulting
eventual stabilization of demand on
world food supplies has virtually no
chance of success.
These two factors, children's special
needs and their special potential, help
explain why young children and their
mothers deserve society's best efforts
at all times, and why during times of
disaster or chronic emergency such as
much of the developing world faces
today, it is urgent that they benefit

from special programmes of assist¬
ance a priority claim to seats in the
"lifeboat".
UNICEF's ongoing development as¬
sistance programmes in more than
130 countries have aimed at improving
child health and nutrition at the level
of the village and the family in rural
areas and in urban slums.
Because its regular resources
$90 million this year, mainly from gov¬
ernments, but also from the public
at large have not permitted UNICEF
to engage in major capital development
projects or mass feeding schemes, it
has concentrated on such general
areas as monitoring the nutritional and
health status of children, encouraging
governments to establish national food
promotes breast feeding, the prep¬
aration and use of low-cost weaning
foods and family planning.
It works to prevent and treat severe
and moderate malnutrition and, on a
selected local basis, provides high-
protein, high-nutrition supplementary
foods for children and mothers.
UNICEF realizes that it cannot reach
all of the 200 million children whose
health and nutrition are threatened by
the economic and food crisis so it is
concentrating on reaching the most
severely affected by placing increased
emphasis for now on supplementary
feeding and has embarked on an
ambitious programme of child relief.
Among the developing countries
most seriously affected by the crisis
UNICEF is seeking more than
$50 million beyond its regular 1975
budget in special contributions from
industrialized countries and oil-pro¬
ducing nations to fund child relief
and emergency supplementary feeding
programmes for mothers and children
in the hardest-hit areas of 15 countries.
The special programmes will also
require some 140,000 tons of food
donations in kind, worth about
$70 million if it had to be purchased
on the open market and far beyond
UNICEF's limited means.
Yet, both the money and food
contributions are urgently needed if
the Children's Fund is to act quickly
to help at least an estimated 3.6 million
children among those who now risk
This little African boy is a victim of kwashiorkor, a disease of young children resulting from
protein malnutrition, which causes skin sores, a bloated belly, stunted growth and mental
retardation (sometimes irreversible). Youngsters with kwashiorkor often die from childhood
diseases such as measles and whooping cough that are rarely fatal in well-nourished children.
The most widespread of nutritional deficiency diseases, kwashiorkor is a primary target of
campaigns to improve child health and nutrition launched by UNICEF in over 130 countries.

and nutrition policies and promoting
community co-operation and local

More specifically it works to
strengthen and expand basic integrated
health services by immunizing children
against diseases, controlling diarrhoea,
developing adequate and accessible
safe water supply and training field
personnel.
It helps educate parents and com¬
munities in nutrition and village-level
food production and storage, and
there are areas where natural ca¬
lamities or war have created pockets
of extreme food scarcity and where
mothers and children are suffering
more.
Civil strife continues in many coun¬

k projects such as vegetable gardens
and fish farms, production of weaning
foods, health and family planning
services, village water supply projects,
food and nutrition education and sur¬
veys and monitoring.
As the serious dimensions of the
situation in food scarcity areas in those
states hit by floods and droughts in
1974 became apparent, the Govern¬
ment of India requested UNICEF's
special help in checking malnutrition
and providing rehabilitative services to
children and expectant and nursing
mothers.
UNICEF acted first by post¬
poning some portions of its regular
programme and diverting about
$4.3 million, one-third of its 1975
budgeted funds for India, for use in
special child relief to reach about
370,000 beneficiaries with drugs, blan¬
kets, clothing and tents as well as
supplementary food until May, 1975.
As the situation worsened, UNICEF
decided to seek $21.5 million in
additional funds plus special food
donations so that it could broaden its
supplementary feeding to reach about
two million people in parts of seven
affected states until May 1976.
The programme calls for three types
of food initially: Special Weaning
Food, a processed blend of soy,
wheat flour, minerals and vitamins,
will be given to infants from age 0-2;
Crude Balahar, a blend of wheat flour
and an indigenous legume called gram,
will be provided for the 2-6 age group
and for pregnant and nursing mothers;
K-Mix-ll (milk, calcium caseinate and
sugar) is reserved for severe cases of
protein-calorie malnutrition such as
kwashiorkor or marasmus, which
require therapy.
UNICEF is seeking additional foods
such as CSM (corn-soy-milk), dried
skim-milk and rolled oats and hopes
that these immediate relief measures
can be phased into integrated child
services that will also meet basic
longer-term needs of children. For
example, the special assistance in¬
cludes $1.5 million for hand-pumps,
pipes and spare parts to step up
village water supply programmes to
help control intestinal diseases in mal¬
nourished children in drought areas.
As lacge as this child relief pro¬
gramme for India seems, it will only
help in many cases save the lives
of some 2 million of the most severely
threatened children in food scarcity
areas until May 1976. The estimated
cost per child: about $36. Yet India
is only one of a number of developing
countries with regions acutely affected
by both the economic crisis and natural
disasters.
It is clear that UNICEF must both
continue to help where it can and to
remind the world of the needs of chil¬
dren and their potential until the
time when the lifeboat pulls up beside
the ship of abundance and that
potential begins to be realized.

1 % of salaries
to fight world hunger
A number of Unesco staff
members have decided to con¬
tribute 1 per cent of their an¬
nual salary to the fight against
world hunger. The proceeds will
go to UNICEF for its programmes
against hunger in needy coun¬
tries. It is hoped that this lead
will be followed by other Unesco
staff members and by those of
organizations in the U.N. sys¬

WITH FOOD AND JUSTICE FOR ALL
(Continued from page 1 1 )
of population and food supply. One
line of reasoning argues that since
population is rising much faster than
food production, we should curb popu¬
lation growth and boost food out¬
put. But in my opinion this Is too
narrow a basis for a truly responsible
form of political reasoning that res¬
pects the fundamental rights and duties
of individuals and nations. Nor are
extrapolations a valid substitute for
reasoned thinking.
The Earth's population reached one
billion about 1820. Some deduce from
this that, for thousands of years, birth
and death rates just about balanc¬
ed each other out, with a slight advan¬
tage to the former. Then, after 1820
the population doubled during the next
105 years, and only took another
35 years to reach three billion
(by 1960).
A simple calculation shows that it
needs a growth rate of 1 per 1,000 over
a period of 217,300 years for the
world's population to reach its first
billion. But this kind of approach in
no way corresponds to reality, for
periods of expansion and stagnation
have alternated throughout human
history.
One might also note that if this
average growth-rate (1 per 1,000) per
sisted for 10,000 years, the Earth's
population would reach 88 billion. But
one would only need to turn this posi¬
tive rate of 1 per 1,000 to a negative
rate of 1 per 1,000 for the planet to
number only 182,000 inhabitants at the
end of the cycle. Clearly, then, the
manipulation of figures is a dangerous
practice, and demographic problems
are far too complex to be reduced
to mere extrapolation.
In the past, for example, population
growth was subject to the hazards of
epidemics (the Black Death reduced
Europe's population by between 35 per
cent and 50 per cent, between 1346
and 1348), and was stimulated by
technical progress, especially in farm¬
ing, only to slow down again consi¬
derably during a period of prosperity.
So it is difficult to define which cause
produces what effect and which is the
major determining factor.
Are we caught up in a vicious circle
of antagonistic forces or, on the
contrary, is there some harmonious
balance between resources and popu¬
lation growth or vice versa ?
Or should we conclude from what
has been said that poverty is the
mother of all evils, that it is to blame
for insufficient food production, for
runaway population growth and for the
inefficient use of resources? Should
we also consider the possibility that the
real causes of the current situation
are the economic, scientific and
technological inequalities that exist
between certain groups of nations?
The fact is that aid provided by rich
nations to the poor countries is
confined to certain techniques which
have brought about a type of social
progress that has upset the biological
balance In these countries because the
necessary supporting investment and
technical know-how has not been
provided.
Given stable social conditions the
absence of war, serious economic
crises or other major catastrophes
it is possible to predict short-term
population changes with some degree
of accuracy. But longer-range fore¬
casts of rates of change over a given
period may be upset by unforeseen
events.
Since all the right conditions for
making forecasts do not exist, all
projected figures must be considered
as hypothetical, since demographers
seem to have an unfortunate tendency
to dramatize the implications of cur¬
rently observed growth rates and their
consequences.
In view of this we would do far better
to reflect on and try to understand the

Jaime E. Estrella, Chief of Planning Services,
Ministry of Agriculture:
"Future generations will critically judge this date in
history if we do not produce a positive reply to 1,000
million people who await our action. This is a time
when the destiny of humanity is in danger, when the
voice of people condemned to death by hunger grows
louder and louder."
MAURITANIA
Diop Mamadou Amadou, Minister for Rural
Development :
"The agricultural crisis has not arisen now nor even
recently, and it is not caused by the increase in oil
prices. For decades the producers of copper, bauxite,
rubber, coffee, and other raw materials sought better
prices for their exports in order to be able to finance
their agricultural development. But all this has been
to no avail."
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
Lionel M. Robinson, Minister of Agriculture,
Lands and Fisheries:
"A great poet once said "sweet are the uses of
adversity". If the crisis which we are all experiencing
and will hopefully survive serves to shock us into
a greater realization of the real importance of agri¬
culture. . . if it drives home the absolute necessity
from a security standpoint of maintaining adequate
stocks of food, then the crisis may well prove to be
a blessing in disguise."
FAO
Addeke H. Boerma, Director-General, U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization :
"The food crisis is desperate for those in hunger-
stricken lands. This is the greatest scandal of our
time. For at planetary level, there need be no crisis
at all. The developed world feeds more cereals to
its livestock than are consumed as food by all the
vast populations of the developing countries together.
With less greed and more compassion, the world
would not today see death by hunger as a reality for
some, and a threat for many, among its citizens.
"What is needed is a world food policy, including
nutrition, as an integral part of a world development
policy. And not merely a world food policy, but a
commitment to action."
WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES
Dr. Philip Potter, General Secretary:
"After several years of involvement in development
aid, the World Council which comprises 271 member
churches numbering hundreds of millions of Chris¬
tians has come to the conviction that a purely
economic growth concept should be replaced by a
process aiming at economic and social justice, self-
reliance and people's participation in decision-making
as a means to the objective of a globally just society."
various factors which, when combined,
could improve things, instead of en¬
deavouring to predict the future popu¬
lation of the world.
I regret that I am unable to propose
a better solution for the moment, but
my main purpose here has been to
stimulate reflexion. My only con¬
clusion will be to say that in dealing
with this highly complex problem,
we should avoid partial solutions,
the piecemeal application of technical
remedies, for these are what have
brought us to the present state of
affairs.
Feeding mankind is a complex activ¬
ity, whose context has varied during
the course of history and has evolved
in response to changing local condi¬
tions. There can be no doubt that
food production must be raised, but as
an integral part of a system leading to
the marketing of produce which itself
is warranted only if food reaches the
consumer. Food consumption is
dependent in turn on purchasing
power, which determines demand, and
purchasing power depends on income
and employment.
In fact the problem is so complex
one may reasonably wonder whether
there is any hope of ever reaching a
satisfactory solution. For though the
above conditions are necessary, they
are not enough. Food production has
its own limitations: the environment,
the availability of land for farming,
soil exhaustion, farming techniques,
water, fertilizers, land ownership sys¬
tems, storage conditions, etc. We
must simplify existing systems and
must never lose sight of the fact that
the ultimate objective is to feed
mankind.
Food supply must be properly
planned and the food situation correctly
analyzed. We are beginning to do
this, and we could do it better
if nations had the political will, to act.
Techniques for evaluating the various
limiting factors would enable us to
define choices, options and policies,
which, when other factors, national
and international, are taken into
account, would enable us to formulate
global policies and priorities.
By adopting this approach we might
hope to «ee the birth of an era of
equitable food distribution, an era of
understanding and control of world
food supply problems.
Failing this, people will continue to
become alarmed, rightly or wrongly,
every time they hear that some coun¬
tries have millions of tons of excess
food, while others have equally mas¬
sive deficits, without it being clear
who is most in need of aid and, above
all, without anything having been done
to tackle the basic causes of this
injustice.

Unesco and United Nations
to spur joint efforts
against apartheid
A seminar sponsored by the United
Nations Special Committee against apart¬
heid was held at Unesco headquarters in
Paris from April 28 to May 2, 1975. The
seminar, which was attended by represen¬
tatives of anti-apartheid movements from
all over the world, considered the present
situation in South Africa and means for
promoting public action against apartheid.
During the seminar, the Director-
General of Unesco, Mr. , Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow, and the Chairman of the United
Nations Special Committee, Mr. Edwin
Ogebe Ogbu (Nigeria), met to exchange
views on concerted international action
against apartheid. Mr. Ogbu stressed the
increasing role Unesco can play in this
struggle, especially in informing world
opinion of the situation in South Africa
and in encouraging educators, scientists,
writers and artists to express their soli¬
darity with the victims of racialism in
South Africa. Mr. M'Bow reiterated
Unesco's commitment to the abolition of
apartheid, racial discrimination and col¬
onialism. He reviewed the activities of
Unesco in this field, with special reference
to the dissemination of Information,
consultations with the liberation movements
recognized by the Organization of African
Unity, and action taken to enable liberation
movements in South Africa to participate
In Unesco's work at different levels.
Mr. M'Bow added that Unesco was
completing studies on the educational
systems in Namibia and Southern Rhodesia
which will draw attention to the effects
of the extension of apartheid to these
territories.
Among other subjects discussed at the
seminar were economic measures to be
taken against South Africa, especially
action to deny the regime oil supplies. A
call was also made for a mandatory
embargo on arms deliveries to South
Africa.
Telecommunications
and meteorology
The theme for this year's World Tele¬
communication Day (May 17) "Telecommu¬
nications and Meteorology", was chosen by
the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) in co-ordination with the World Meteo¬
rological Organization (WMO), which also
adopted it for World Meteorological Day
(March 23, 1975). Telecommunications and
meteorology are complementary sciences:
high-quality telecommunications are vital for
collecting and disseminating weather infor¬
mation ; weather has an important influence
on the quality of radio communications.
Invisible fishing nets
Fishing nets made of a transparent nylon
strand virtually invisible to fish under
water are boosting catches in Japan and
other countries. In Japan, which produces
about half the netting used in the world's
fisheries, almost all gillnets are now made
of this material. So effective are the nets
that their use has been banned In areas
such as the Canadian salmon fisheries
where conservation is a serious problem.
Rural nutrition
in Monsoon Asia
A new book, "Rural Nutrition in Monsoon
Asia", provides valuable background for
those working in this vast region on prob¬
lems of undernutrition and malnutrition
economists, agriculturists, pediatricians,
anthropologists. "Only by a combination
of all these disciplines", writes the author,
Robert Orr Whyte, "and by basing con¬
clusions upon the study of the rural
communities themselves, can viable national
plans be evolved." (See Bookshelf.)
U.S. contribution
to help save Borobudur
The American Committee for Borobudur,
a private fund-raising organization, has
presented Unesco with $1,275,000 to help
preserve the huge Buddhist sanctuary of
Borobudur in Java (Indonesia). The inter¬
national campaign to save Borobudur
launched by Unesco has so far netted
$3,800,000 from 18 countries and private
organizations. The total cost of the six-
year restoration programme is currently
estimated at $8 million, of which Unesco
has undertaken to raise $5 million.
Space communication
and cultural exchange
During a recent visit to Canada,
Unesco's Director-General, Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow, inaugurated a Franco-
Canadian debate on "the ~ evolution of
communication and the development of
cultures" on April 8. The debate was
transmitted to Europe by the "Symphony"
satellite, constructed by France and the
Fed. Rep. of Germany and launched into
orbit in December 1974. Mr. M'Bow
recalled Unesco's close Interest in space
communication since 1960, and stressed
the benefits this medium of information
could bring for cultural exchanges and
international understanding.
Flashes
At least one-third of the urban population
in developing countries live in slums and
squatter settlements, which are qrowinq
at a rate of 15 per cent a year, says a
U.N. study on world housing and urbaniz¬
ation.
The Evangelical Church in the Fed. Rep.
of Germany has given $1,142,000 to Unes¬
co's funds-in-trust project to help re-equip
39 Peruvian schools destroyed by an earth¬
quake.
The German Democratic Republic has
joined the Universal Copyright Convention
and the Unesco Convention on the Struggle
Against Discrimination in Education.
Unesco is to award three-month fellow¬
ships in education for international co¬
operation and peace to six teachers
participating in the Unesco Associated
Schools Project.
