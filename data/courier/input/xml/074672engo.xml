KOREA-TO REPEL AGGRESSION AND RESTORE PEACE the United Nations goes into action. In response to the
Security Council call for help against the North Korean invaders, sixteen member nations sent land, sea and air forces
as their contribution to the world's first armed collective security action.
THE date was October 24,
1949. High above the
rows of seats in San-
tiago de Chile's large
stadium the flags of many coun-
tries floated in the wind. A blue
one, with a white laurel wreath
surrounding the five continents,
dominated all the others. It
was somewhat difficult to
concentrate on this flag repre-
senting the United Nations
because there were 40, 000
people in the Chilean stadium
and they were applauding a
group of dancers and singers
from all Latin America who
had come to celebrate a single
day dedicated to a united
world.
A united world ? Peace ?
Were these idle, utopian
dreams ? I asked myself two
years ago as I sat in the San-
tiago stadium. It was not eay
to say emphatically"no"even
then. Today the dangers are
even greater and the challenge
more urgent. The crisis of our
time is such that almost all of
us live with fear in our hearts.
On October 24, 19M, I re-
member, the U. N. flag had re-
called to my mind the birth-
place of the United Nations
in San Francisco in 1945. The
name"San Francisco"had
conjured up the figure of
St. Francis of Assisi, who ac-
cording to legend, considered
all animal-even the wolves
- his"brothers" ; who helped
all creatures in need and, by his
example of kindness and humil-
itv, imparted his faith in a
better world to all who appro-
ached him.
There was something of the
Franciscan spirit in the Charter
established by the United Na-
tions in San Francisco. Un-
fortunately, St. Francis did not
succeed in changing either the
world or the spirit of man. In
fact, far from considering all
solves his brothers, man has
come to think of his brothers as
wolves. And kindness bv itself,
or the will to let justice be
done, has not as yet proved
enough to permit good to
triumph over evil.
So mankind was obliged to
find some kind of machinery
capable of checking the inter-
national tensions that even-
tually lead to wars, and aggres-
sion itself. In the same way
as national laws punish offen-
ders to maintain a moral equi-
librium within society, so the
United Nations Charter esta-
hlished its own measures to
Counter the international ag-
gresor or offender. The need
to do this gave rise to the prin-
ciple of collective security. It
remained to be seen, however,
whether the United Nations
Charter could be effectively
Applied in an emergency or if
it would prove to be nothing
more than mere words and
empty rhetoric.
In 1950, the moment to put
the principle to the test came in
Korea. At this juncture the
verv existence and future of the
United Nations was at stake.
In 1935, the invasion of Abys-
sinia and the inability of the
League of Nations to deal with
this act of aggression, ultima-
tely led to the collapse of collec-
tive security as a preventive
weapon and ended in collapse
of the League itself with the
outbreak of World War II.
We all know that when the
human bodv is attacked bv cer-
tain infectious germs, an army
of other organisms which we
may call"health"germs go into
action to ward off the attack
and on many occasions save the
life of the patient. Similarly,
the attack on the United Nations
and the principles of its Char-
ter-which represents the
vast majority of the peoples of
the world-led to immediate
counter-action proving that in
the case of the U. N' ; collective
security was not an idle phrase
but a moral obligation on the
part ot its members to act. It
showed that respect for law-
one of the foundations of inter-
national order-was a realitv
and that nations were prepared
to oppose efforts to change that
order by violence.
But the United Nations looks
beyond armed conflicts. It is
esientially concerned with the
construction of the conditions
of world peace. The human
body contains not only defen-
sive micro-organisms ; it has
essential functional organs.
The United Nations too has its
functional organs (the specializ-
ed agencies) and a neuro-motor
co-ordinating system in the
Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC). For just existing
is not enough.
We mut live with dignity
and raise the living conditions
of men, both individually and
collectively. For this purpose,
other specialized agencies of the
UN were created. Each of
them has a part to play in
laying a firm foundation for
international peace.
This year, for United Nations
Day, October 24, 1951, the theme
chosen to mark the sixth anni-
versary of the world organiza-
tion-"To Combine Our Ef-
forts"-has been taken from
the Preamble to the UN Char-
ter, in which"We, the Peoples
of the United Nations"have
promised"to combine our
efforts"to accomplish the aims
set forth in that document.
This means not only stopping
wars, but working together, as
peoples and as nations, to re-
move the causes of war-nar-
row-minded nationalism, reli-
gious, social and political into-
lerance, hunger and poverty,
disease and ignorance.
"Let us measure the causes of
our present disputes against the rea-
sons we have to unite in the face of
problems so vast", 1\1. Torres Bodet
has declared."Tile future dictates
our present dutv. International co-
operation in all fields is not a gene-
rous and debatable aspiration. It is
an urgent necessity for every single
country. The United Nations sum-
mon all men to this task, which is
not directed against anyone, but
serves the interests of all peoples
and respects the liberty of all."
Let us indeed Combine Our
EfTorts.
José de BENITO.

OCTOBE"1951 Pate 3-UNESCO COURIER
Our Efforts...
October 24... On this date six years ago the Char-
ter of the United Nations came into force. The
anniversary is observed by Member Nations
throughout the world. On this day we reaffirm the
aims of the organization, we recall its achieve-
ments and we pledge"... to combine our efforts..."
to realize its purposes.
Collective Armed Action Against Aggression
Continued Efforts for Peaceful Settlement
Wherever Possible
International Action for E. conomic and Social
Progress
Aid to Peoples on the Road to Independence.
These were the main avenues along which the
United Nations advanced in the sixth year of its
existence. Throughout the world, in every field
of human activity, the U. N. and its Specialized
Agencies initiated actions towards the achieve-
ment of the goals of the Charter. The focal points
were KOREA, the first example in history of the
use of collective force to restore peace, and TECH-
N) CAL ASStSTANCE for under-developed areas,
a positive programme to make the world a
better place to live in.
REHABILITATION OF KOREA IS ONE OF UN'S BIGGEST JOBS. Only broad international
action can bring relief to the hungry and homeless people. Member nations have already
made contributions. For instance, Thailand and the Philippines have sent rice ; Israel sulfa
drugs. Altogether, over 8200, 000, 000 has been pledged for relief and rehabilitation. Shown
here is rice distribution in Seoul.
FOR PROSPERITY AND DEVELOPMENT : TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.
To stimulate economic and social advance, the UN provides technical know-
ledge and expert advice to under-developed countries. Example : the Greek
scheme for the utilization of idle manpower, introduced by a UN adviser. The
results : 5, 272 kilometres of roads built or improved, 50, 000 acres of land
reclaimed by 150, 000 volunteers.
HELP ON THE ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE : LIBYA. The United Nations has
resolved the future of the former Italian colonies. One of them, Libya, is to
become under U. N. guidance an independent and sovereign state by 1952.
Here the Libyan King-Designate arrives in Tripoli, where the National Assem-
bly met to proclaim a provisional government and to draft a constitution.
FOR THE WORLD'S CHILDREN : UNICEF. Shoes for Greece's children, just
one example of the world-wade operations of the United Nations International
Children's Emergency Fund. A school-luncheon, a pair of shoes or an anti-
T. B. vaccine, provided by UNICEF, have made the U. N. a living reality to mil-
lions of youngsters throughout the world.

UNESCO COURIER-Page 4 OCTOBER 1951
Specialized Agencies
carry out much of
the United Nations'
practical work
O HEALTH : WORLD FIGHT AGAINST DtSEASE.The World Health Organization (WHO) concentrates its
efforts on eradicating diseases : malaria, T. B., typhus. Here
a Haitian mother brings her baby for a penicillin injection
against yaws. A WHO team of doctors and nurses is working
in the Marbial Valley of Haiti, where Unesco has a fundamental
education pilot project, to help fight this crippling disease.
&commat; REFUGEES : OFF TO A NEW LIFE. Over one million dis-placed persons have been repatriated or resettled by the
International Refugee Organization () RO). MiHions have
received care and maintenance from IRO and other UN agen-
cies. In Palestine, over 800, 000 refugees depend on UN help.
8FUNDAMENTAL EDUCATION : A WORLD CAMPAIGNAGAINST IGNORANCE. Illiteracy breeds poverty and
disease. Over half the world's population can neither read
nor write. That is whey Unesco is working to ensure the basic
minimum of education for everyone, along with the knowledge
and skills to enable them to improve their living conditions.
At Patzcuaro, Mexico (shown here), Unesco has set up the first
of a world network of regional fundamental education centres.
OAVIATION : INTERNATIONAL TRAINING FOR PER-
 SONNEL. Rapid growth of aviation makes it necessary
to develop nuclei of trained personnel in technically less advan-
ced regions. International Civil Aviation Organization (tCAO)
has a training scheme to ensure safe maintenance of airfields
in all parts of the world.
FOR LABOUR : IMPROVEMENT OF WORKING CONDI---T) ONS. The International Labour Organization (ILO)
helps countries in solving such labour problems as man-
power, migration, social security ; it promotes international
standards of industrial safety.
"LOANS BUILD INDUSTRIES. The International Bank forReconstruction and Development grants loans to war-
devastated and under-developed countries. Loans are used
for hydroelectric power development (shown here), improve-
ment of agriculture, rebuilding of port facilities.
Ð FOOD-THROUGH BETTER AGRICULTURE. Spreadingadvanced agricultural methods is one of tasks of the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Examples : introduc-
tion of hybrid corn in Europe, soil surveys in Ecuador, pond-
fish production in Haiti, sheep breeding in Afghanistan. FAO
also works to improve world timber resources.

OCTOBER t95) Page 5-UNESCO COURIER
Three major United Nations tasks
in the economic and social fields
THE activities of the United Nations in the economic and social field, and thoseof the twelve specialized agencies of which Unesco is one, are reviewed by the
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) each summer. This Council is em-
powered not only to direct the future work of its own commissions, but also to make
recommendations to the specialized agencies. By such a survey of the full range of
work undertaken by organizations located in different world capitals, ECOSOC stimu-
lates collaboration in the many cases where joint action is needed, and makes it
possible to lay down certain priority tasks to which the efforts of all the organiza-
tions should be aimed.
At the session of the Council which ended last month in Geneva, particular
emphasis was laid by all the members on major tasks which should figure prominently
in the programmes of the various organizations during the next few years. Three
of these merit particular attention here.
o AIDING UNDER-DEVELOPED REGIONS
THE social and economic developmentof under-developed areas is perhaps
the most important single aim ever
tackled through international action. The
United Nations and most of its specialized
agencies have joined in this great effort
which received powerful encouragement
when, in 1949, the Economic and Social
Council launched the U. N. Expanded
Programme of Technical Assistance for
the Economic Development of Under-
Developed Countries. This programme is
in many ways unique : it is a fully
co-operative undertaking in which all
the organizations play a part through
special budgets. A large number of
governments-some of them not
members of the United Nations-have
contributed a total of over $20, 000, 000.
While the programme is only meant to
contribute the technical aid of experts, it
has already shown its capacity to"prime
the pump"of economic development and
to set in motion activities far exceeding in
scope what could be financed out of the
relatively small sum just mentioned.
Unesco's main contribution has been in
the educational field, since no community
can hope to improve its economic standards
lastingly unless there is some real
understanding by its members of the
purpose of the effort required. Greatest
emphasis has been placed on fundamental
and adult education, that is to say, the
emergency type of elementary education
which governments are introducing in
areas where neither the children nor
their parents have had the benefit of an
organized school system. In 1947 Unesco
organized the first international experi-
ment in fundamental education in a
distressed valley in Haiti. Unesco's
conception of fundamental education,
which was first hammered out there, is
not confined to the rudiments of schooling,
but also includes education in such
matters as modern agriculture, public
health, village industries and crafts.
The Haiti experiment has been followed
by many others. Unesco either sends
experts to advise on the launching
of fundamental education projects or
conducts the projects wholly or partly
itself. This year Unesco has launched a
world campaign against ignorance and its
evils which will attack this problem at its
base-the lack of Fundamental
Education specialists. The programme is
based on the idea of"training by chain
reaction"which foresees a growing army
of 5, 000 teachers of teachers within
12 years through a network of regional
training centres spread around the globe.
The need for scientific advice has also
emerged sharply, and Unesco is now
providing technical help in the applied
sciences and is also devoting attention to
the important psychological problems
which may arise when a primitive
community is abruptly brought face to
face with problems of modern indus-
trialization.
MAKING HUMAN RIGHTS A REALITY
THE gradual realization in practice ofthe fundamental human rights
inscribed in the Universal De-
claration of 1948 is another major theme.
Unesco has its own contributions to make
in the fields of education, science and
culture. It has launched, with the support
of some fifty nations, a world campaign
for free and compulsory primary schooling
wherever it is not yet fully in operation,
thus aiding in the fulfilment of the right
to education which appears in Article 26
of the Universal Declaration. In many
different ways it, its promoting the
enjoyment of the right freely to par-
ticipate in the cultural life of the
community, and to share in scientific
advancement and its benefits (Article 27).
It is also in a variety of ways, and
particularly by proposing means to
overcome the existing barriers to the free
movement of information across frontiers,
endeavouring to give greater reality to
every man's right to be fully informed
about events all over the world.
The Economic and Social Council not
only reviews the progress achieved by the
specialized agencies in such matters as
health, food, labour and education, but is
also framing a Human Rights Covenant,
which will ultimately be laid before the
world's parliaments, and which will give
legal effect to the principles laid down in
the Universal Declaration.
&commat; STRENGTHEN) NG THE BULWARKS OF PEACE
THE third field of major internationaleffort which should be mentioned
here is the continuing effort to
assure and strengthen peace throughout
the world. It is true that the problems
here are in large part political and, as
such, outside the purview of ECOSOC.
The Twenty Years'Programme for Peace
launched a year ago by Mr. Trygve Lie,
Secretary-General of the United Nations,
is not, however, entirely concerned with
political and military issues. It also
speaks of the minimum conditions of
economic and social well-being without
which peace must remain insecure.
Unesco is working on several aspects of
this paramount problem of strengthening
the bulwarks of peace. It has studied
and reported on methods and techniques
by which the doctrines of international
understanding and of the brotherhood of
man may become real in the minds of all ;
it is investigating particular situations
which may arise in areas in process of
economic change, where dangerous states
of tension are latent in different sections
of the community ; it is seeking to bring
about a wider understanding of and
support for United Nations action to
enforce collective security, notably among
the young ; and through the mass media
it has. sought to publish, broadcast and
screen information designed to awaken
peoples'interest in the lives and achieve-
ments of their fellow men. This group
of activities received special attention at
Unesco's own General Conference this
year, and the Organization's support for
the United Nations was specifically and
enthusiastically pledged by some sixty
delegations without dissent.
These annual proceedings of the Eco-
nomic and Social Council are therefore
much more than formal and constitu-
tional. They provide a unique opportunity
of integrating the efforts of twelve or
more international organizations, and of
inspiring them anew with faith in the
basic purposes for which they were
created. Specialised agencies like Unesco
are of course autonomous, and are only
bound by the decisions of their own
annual conferences. Perhaps the value
of the Economic and Social Council's
survey lies precisely in its largely informal
character. The members of the Council,
the directors-general of the various
organizations, the officials and specialists
who attend, can all speak freely and com-
ment on each other's work.
There may be some disagreement on
points of political doctrine ; there are
constant problems of administration and
of financing, to be tackled and overcome.
But it cannot be doubted that the Eco-
nomic and Social Council provides Unesco
and its sister agencies with an invaluable
occasion to view their own work in true
perspective and to link it with the other
work of the United Nations.
The first of a series of buildings to house the permanent
headquarters of the United Nations has been completed and
is already in use. This 39-storey Secretariat skyscraper can
accommodate 4, 000 people. When fully completed, the head-
quarters site will serve the General Assembly, ECOSOC
and other UN bodies in New York City.

0Oft'tMst
IN the time of Pericles the average Athenian wasfirmly convinced that the Boeotians were dull-
witted, the Cretans liars and the Asiatics effe-
minate and uncivilized.
Such clichés as these have now lost their
offensive connotation, although literature has
nevertheless kept them alive for 2, 500 years.
During this time, however, countries and commu-
nities have invented many others. Those in
common use today, and there are hundreds, are
not lacking in virulence. Ask anyone, in any lan-
guage, to complete slogans like"The Germans are...
The Jews are... The French are...", and, as likely
as not. he will not hesitate to give the usual hasty
judgments. The opinion varies with the nationa-
lity of the person expressing it : those who are
regarded as"scientific and hard-working"by their
neighbours in the West may be no more than
"militaristic and hyprocritical"to Eastern eyes.
IF scientifically controlled examples are neededthere are plenty-scandalous or diverting
according to the mood of the reader-in a
book by Professor otto Klineberg, which the Social
Science Research Council has published in New
York. This book, which gives results of research
into"Tensions. Affecting International Understand-
ing", is a contribution to the work undertaken by
Unesco in the field of Social Sciences. The pur-
pose of this work is clear when one considers the
abounding errors and misconceptions, even between
countries which regard one another as friendly,
in their statements and discussions. Errors and
misconceptions cause resentment and tension, and
the result is too often catastrophic. The first need
is for understanding, for prejudices must be ana-
lysed before they can be destroyed. And what a
jungle of pseudo-science must be uprooted, full
of slogans, illogical ideas, and clichés !
Before dealing with these cliches-or, as a
sociologist calls them, national stereotypes-Dr.
Klineberg is honest enough to ask if they do after
all contain a"kernel of truth". When ten or
twenty million people regard their neighbours as
either frivolous, witty or lazy, should not their
opinion be accepted as the starting point for
an investigation of the existence of such qua-11.... _t T., . .... L :.... : L, ... alities ? In practice it seems wrong
to rely on opinions. Those who
express them may be in1iuenced by
even the most anecdotal history,
while propaganda exerts an even
more powerful sway. To upset these
unstable opinions may only require
the effects of a few novels, films, or
vague fears. Politics is another
important factor.
If economic interests become in-
volved, an entire race can find itself
regarded in a different light over-
night. Dr. Klineberg recalls the
history of the Chinese in California.
(He has taken an example from his.".""., 4,." 1", 4 mh, 4 4ho"r, ninrvown country, but what other nation has not had
similar experiences ?).
A hundred years and more ago, California gave
these Chinese a cordial welcome. The white gold-
hunters wanted to get rich quickly and they
needed good workers and servants."The Chin-
ese,"said the papers of that era,"are very
capable, sober, tractable, inoffensive, law-abiding...
The most worthy of our newly adopted citizens."
The 1860's arrived, with industrial upheavels, an
influx of population from the centre and the east
- and unemployment. At the elections of 1867
the two parties were promising to"protect the
Californians against Mongolian competition."The
Chinese were now described as"unassimilable,
criminal, debased and servile, deceitful and
vicious."In short, they had outlived their use-

A number of universities submitted to their
students a list of different ethnic groups through-
out the world and asked them to state what
degree of like or dislike they felt towards each. In
the long list the names of three entirely imaginary
peoples were introduced-the Danireans, the
Pirineans and the Valonanians. The results were
invariable. Each time a minority of students
abstained from judging these imaginary peoples ;
but the others did not hesitate to record their like

with disfavour and sometimes the Pirineans and
the Valonanians were held in greater esteem than
real peoples. It is true that if these unfortunate
students had never seen a Valonanian, neither
had they ever come into contact with, for example.
Hindus or Arabs.
This is the root of the problem : None of them
had ever seen the Arabs. But, then, who will ever
see the Americans ? In former times, a classical
education did at least inculcate the simple rule nnt
to attribute to all, the qualities of the indivi-
dual ; in extolling the virtue of Penelope, it
remained silent on the general fidelity of Ithacan
wives. Thus it was hoped that a man of culture
would be recognized by his refusal,in all circumstances, to give force-
ful judgments on peoples, races or
vague ideas in general.
Today most people are willing to
admit their folly in talking about
things of which they know nothing
yet fail to recognize that such
chatter is dangerous. Dr. Kline-
berg notes that"those wbjects
who reacted unfavourably to minor-
ity groups were, on the whole, those
who reacted in term of the stereo-
type. They were the people who
said,'The Jews are...''The English
are...'The very willingness to speak
rl t. rrn. < : : on tl1p h. < : : i. < : : nf l1nvprifipnin such general terms on the basis of unverified
and frequently unverifiable assumptions is to be
regarded as suspect."
The word"suspect"seems inadequate when one
realizes that these unfounded assumptions form a
part-perhaps bigger than ever-of the edu-
cation received by children at home, in the street,
and even at school. Every parent is not a logician
and of course society must respect the basic truths
that are expressed around the family table. But
there is nothing to stop society from countering the
prejudices which, for instance, are created by
doubtful children's"literature".
Numerous studies have shown that a traitor or
the criminal in such literature must invariably be
a foreigner, and as often as not, a member of a
hated or despised group. When the adolescent no
longer reads these periodicals he finds the same
"diet"in popular magazines. Dr. Klineberg reports
an interesting analysis of national stereotypes pre-
sented by eight particularly successful magazines.
Close examination of 198 short stories in these
publications revealed that their characters played
their role only according to a strictly established
ethnic hierarchy : one nationality fits the gangster,
one origin the harlot, one skin colour the half-wit.
FOR the schools, Dr. Klineberg stresses"theextent to which textbooks can influence chil-
dren". After examining a number of these
books, and especially those dealing with history,
he declare. s :"The authors of secondary-school
history texbooks in all countries are substantially
in agreement that the leaders of their own country
were honourable and their soldiers noble and cour-
ageous ; when defeated, it was because of the
overwhelming force of the enemy ; the enemy,
whatever his identity, was treacherous and
cowardly."
Under Unesco auspices, numerous educators.
historians and geographers are trying to bring
about a reform of the textbooks in use ; the aim is
impartiality. The purpose of such a reform is not
to tarnish, in the eyes of young citizens, the
honour and glory of their ancestors, but only to
enable them ALSO to believe in the rights and
honour of their neighbours across the sea or the
frontier.
The unequivocal aim of all education worthy of
the name is to fight continually against the pre-
judices, ignorant misunderstandings and stupid
hatreds which daily invade the mind of the child.
But neither the teachers, nor the philisophers, are
enough to silence the sententious chorus which, at
every corner of the globe, and every level of society,
continues to express its distrust and fear of the
Cretans and Valonanians.

MODERN ARCHAEOLOGISTS'DIG'
FROM AEROPLANES
OCTOBER I 9 51
BRITISH farmers near Andoverwere sceptical when they
heard that there were clear
and unmistakeable traces of
an important native settlement
buried in their fields. They
knew every inch of their land,
and there were definitely no signs
that they could see of it. Their
district had long been of interest
to archaeologists, but these
experts had never found any
"clues"in the ground to such a
settlement.
The way in which it was
discovered seemed strange too. It
was not by excavations, but by
air photographs. And the pic-
tures were taken, not before
cultivation started, when it was
easiest to see the land, but just
prior to harvest time, when the
thick crop made the soil virtually
invisible.
But after they saw the photo-
graphs, there was no doubt about
it : there, among the growing
'crops, was a remarkably clear
outline of what the settlement
looked like in plan. Even long-
buried ditches and pits were
revealed.
For the archaeologists, it was
another example of how air
photography can yield results that
observers on the ground can never
hope for.
Variations in vegetation reflect
features buried below the surface
and long lost to sight. Photo-
by Richard O'FARRELL
graphs taken from the air can
give extraordinarily detailed cla-
rification of these features, thus
enabling archaeologists to recon-
struct the history, form and
growth of towns, villages, garri-
sons and buildings.
Nature's Sketch Book
E YEN when such markingscan be seen from the
ground, they are often so
distorted by perspective that no
recognizable pattern can be dis-
cerned. The aircraft, on the
other hand, provides an overall
survey.
Air photography has, of course,
been used extensively in Britain
and other countries for town and
country planning and in the
revision of maps. But archaeo-
logists cannot obtain all the in-
formation they want from these
high altitude photographs, which
are taken at any time of the year.
Their investigations call for a
more detailed reconnaissance
carried out at between 1, 000 and
3, 000 feet under the right
conditions of lighting, weather
and vegetation.
Only for a short period each
summer, a few weeks before
harvest time, does arable land
become nature's historical sketch
book, when the infinite patterns
of crop-markings disclose to
archaeologists the presence, the
character and even the epoch of
buried features.
But in these few weeks of
each year, Britain's air-minded
archaeologists have already made
a large number of important
discoveries. For instance, three
Roman forts which they located
in Watling Street offer a big
opportunity of obtaining new
information about the history of
the Roman conquest.
The usefulness of these photo-
graphs also depends on the soil
and type of crop. In general,
long-rooted cereals, viewed in the
late spring or early summer, give
the most sensitive renderings.
Photographs taken at Carriden,
Linlithgowshire in 1945, clearly
revealed the three ditches of a
fort under a crop of wheat ; the
following year, a grass crop
showed nothing.
Rotation of Clues
OFTEN the most satisfactoryresults are not to be obtain-
ed unless observations are
made over a number of years.
Only a proportion of agricultural
land will give results at any one
time ; rotation of crops will reveal
different"clues".
Year after year the archaeolo-
gists returned to photograph the
Roman camps at Dunblane,
Scotland, and each time they got
a more complete idea of just what
it looked like over a couple of
thousand years ago.
The extreme drought of 1949
caused the plan of one corner of
the 50-acre legionary fortress at
Inchtuthill, Perthshire, to appear
in exceptional detail as parch-
marks in rough grass. It reveal-
ed that there would have been
rows of timber barracks arranged
in facing pairs. Not only the
main walls, but also the internal
partitions of the barracks became
clear, forming a remarkable
record of the plan of a timber
fortress such as cannot at present
be seen anywhere else throughout
the territories that formed the
Roman Empire.
Under the searching gaze of
the air camera, even Stonehenge
- one of the best known and
most studied monuments in the
world-had to reveal some of the
secrets it had kept from archaeo-
logists for centuries.
The possibilities of aerial
archaeology are immense, and
already its discoveries cover all
periods between the New Stone
Age and the present day. It is an
instrument of research of the
utmost value in the study of man's
social development.

STONEHENGE, the most famous megalithic monument in Great Britain, has been studied by archaeologists from all over the world. This aerial photo-
graph shows the complexity of the memorial, whose construction extended over a long period. The view was taken from the east along the line of the ave-

ROMAN'RUNWAY'.-The archaeologist who went up to photograph a
relic of 2, 000 years ago-a Roman road intersection which had been revealed
by parch marks in the grass at Badbury Rings (Dorset)-was amazed
at its similarity to plane runways.

The existence of this big henge"
monument at Coupland (North-

two years ago when aerial pho-

ference in the colour of the
vegetation. Yet this"clue"to a
memorial that would have been
about 280 ft in diameter could
not be distinguished by an observ-
er on the ground. In the same
way, details of an oval-shaped
building at Hutton Moor, York-
shire, were revealed by the lines
in a cereal harvest. It would
have been surrounded by a large
embankment and two moats-
one inside it and the other out-
side-which were cut by the
two entrances. These are stri king
examples of the part aviation can

geology. Recently, under the

ASPECTS OF SCIENCE
IN THE FRIGID REALMS
OF ABSOLUTE ZERO
THE human spirit thrives onj challenge, and scientists are
human. Small wonder, then,
that experiments striving to obtain
a knowledge of nature at extreme
conditions attainable in the labo-
ratory have always had a parti-
cular fascination for many
pioneers of science. So it has been
with the attempts to examine and
understand the behaviour of
matter at extremely low tempe-
ratures. The struggle to attain
the absolute zero is the laboratory
counterpart of the fight to reach
the poles of the earth or to scale
Everest, but with one difference :
The physicist knows from the start
that his attempt will be in vain.
What do we mean by the abso-
lute zero of temperature ? Modern
science has established beyond all
doubt the notion that"tempera-
ture"is merely a rneasure of the
ceaseless, frenzied dance of the
molecules of which all matter is
composed-the"minute vibratory
motion of the particles of bodies"
in the words of Newton. Heating
an object means giving its myriad
molecules a higher average speed,
cooling it means reducing their
speed. While there is no apparent
upper limit to temperatures attain-
able in the universe (the centre
of a hot. star is probably at about
40, 000, 000 degrees), there is a
theoretically fixed lowest tempe-
rature-the absolute zero-where
all molecular motion would cease.
To attain this condition, the whole
of the chaotic movement of the
molecules would have to be stilled.
The Air Turns Blue
WATER freezes at 0 degreesCentigrade (32 degrees on
the Fahrenheit scale) ;"dry
ice", or solid carbon dioxide is at
73 degrees below the Centigrade
zero (-100 deg. F.) ; by compres-
sing it and then removing heat by
means of flowing water, ordinary
air can be converted into a bluish
liquid at-183 deg. C (-300 deg.
F. The absolute zero would fall
at-273 deg. C., or--460 deg. F.
Scientists have not quite attained
it in practice-and there are good
theoretical indications that they
never will-although they have
come within a few thousandths of
Low-temperature research is one of the most
fascinating frontiers of modern-day physics.It has brought about such things as household
refrigeration and the mass production of
liquefied gases, used for liquid-fuel rockets
and supersonic aeroplanes. liquid hydrogen
may also be important in future experiments
in interplanetary rocket propulsion. Drawing
shows a helium refrigerator which maintains
full tanks of liquefied-gas propellants for use
in rocket experimentation.
Research in low-temperature physics has
increased at a striking rate since the end of
the last war with the development of a helium
liquefier devised by Prof. S. C. Collins of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With
this apparatus (alongside) it is possible to
proceed directly from the temperature of cold
tap water to that of liquid helium, without the
aid of special cooling agents such as liquid
hydrogen or liquid air. Whereas prior to 1946
only two U. S. laboratories were doing low
temperature r search, there are now over three
dozen such laboratories and a score in several
other countries. (Photo Arthur D. Little Inc.).

a degree of this mark. This they
do by starting with liquid helium,
which is only about 4 deg. C. above
absolute zero.
Cotton Gets Dangerous
EARLY in the last centuryMichael Faraday, the English
experimental genius, first
succeeded in changing an appa-
rently"permanent"gas, chlorine,
to the liquid form ; by the end of
the century oxygen, nitrogen and
hydrogen had been liquefied allow-
ing experimenters to reach as
low as 20 deg. above the absolute
zero. Helium, the last hold-out
among the gases, yielded to
fl. Kamerlingh Onnes, working at
the famous low-temperature labo-
ratory in Leyden, in 1908. By
making liquid helium evaporate
rapidly, Onnes reached down to
within a single degree of the abso-
lute zero. From this jumping-off
point, modern methods making
use of magnetism can chill sam-
ples of matter to within perhaps
0. 001 deg. Modifications now in the
planning stage carry the promise
of narrowing the gap to about
one-millionth of a degree, but the
experimental difficulties are for-
midable.
The last few degrees of the ther-
mometric range are of tremendous.
interest to science, because in this
region matter behaves in quite
unexpected and puzzling ways.
Already at liquid-air temperature,
peculiar things happen. Rubber
becomes as brittle as glass, and
shatters in thousands of pieces if
dropped on the noor. Cotton that
, has been immersed in liquid air
explodes like gunpowder when
lighted with a match. These
things are demonstrated in school
science laboratories.
However, one of the most inte-
resting phenomena is that of
super-conductivity, shown by a
number of metals when brought
to within a few degrees of absolute
zero. A weak current of electri-
city is passed through a wire of
the metal. Then, as the tempe-
rature is lowered, a critical point
i. s reached where the metal ceases
to oppose the flow of the current
altogether. Under these condi-
tions, if the current is merely
started and the battery then dis-
connected, the current will con-
tinue to flow virtually for ever.
Equally curious things happen with
respect to the magnetic behaviour
of metals in the weird lower
reaches of the thermometric scale.
Since many practical electrical
devices involve magnets and elect-
rical coils, the possibilities fore-
shadowed by these discoveries are
being watched with great interest
by engineers.
. Zero'Brings Warmth
BUT the most anomalous andenigmatic behaviour of all is
shown by the very substance
that enables us to descend to the
lowest levels of temperature-li-
quid helium. By rapidly pumping
away the vapour rising from this
liquid, its temperature can be
lowered to little more than two
deg. above absolute zero. At this
point its behaviour becomes like
that of no other known liquid. It
finds its way with ease through
the smallest of holes. It further
resists attempts at confinement by
creeping up the sides of its con-
tainer, to escape over the rim.
Again, this coldest of all liquids
is, paradoxically, a remarkable
conductor of heat. When one side
of a vessel containing liquid
helium is warmed, a surge of heat
is rapidly conveyed to the other
side. From the analogy with the
transmission of sound waves
through the air, the Russian ex-
perimenters who first noticed this
phenomenon called it"second
sound."Although a general in-
terpretation of these unique obser-
vations can be given in terms of
the quantum theory (see the
Courier for November, 1950>, there
is undoubtedly much yet to be
discovered in the frigid realm of
the absolute zero.
Readers desiring a free copy of
a brief bibliography on Low Tem-
perature Physics should write to the
Division for the Popularization of
Science, Unesco, 19, Avenue X ! eber,
PARIS <16'), France.
Most of us are familiar with two differ-
ent scales of temperature and two
definitions of zero : Fahrenheit and
Centigrade. Scientists, however, have
been working for some time with a third :
the Kelvin or Absolute Zero scale.
The three scales more or less reflect
the history of man's understanding of
heat and cold. Gabriel Daniel Fahren-
heit, the German physicist who manu-
factured meteorological instruments, set
zero at the lowest emperature he could
then obtain by freezing a mixture. On
this scale"absolute zero"is-459. 6
degrees F. In 1742, six yeafs after
Fahrenheit's death, the Swedish astro-
nomer Anders Celsius proposed a new
scale with the freezing point of water at
normal atmospheric pressure as zero
and its boiling point as 100. This scale,
usually called Centigrade, was officially
renamed the Celsius Scale four years
ago by an International Conference on
Weights and Measures In Paris. Since
the abbreviation C. is retained, the
change Is not too important for the
layman. On the Centigrade or Celsius
scale, absolute zero is-273. 16 degrees C.
Both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales
are essentially arbitrary, like the kilo-
gram, the pound, the mile or the metre.
In 1848, with the increase in low-tem-
perature research, the British scientist
Lord Kelvin proposed his"absolute"
scale. This retained the Celsius degree
but shifted zero to the lowest tempera-
ture imaginable (the total immobility
of mo ! ecuies). Absolute zero, therefore,
is zero degrees in the Kelvin scale, which
is usually abbreviated K. The above
thermometer shows significant empera-
tures in respect to the absolute zero
in the Kelvin scale. Thus water is
shown, as boiling at +373 degrees K.
and freezing at +273 degrees K. All
other figures are indicated in the Kelvin
scale and can be converted to the Cen-
tigrade or Celsius scale by subtracting
273 degrees.

TEMPORARY HOME
FOR UNITED NATIONS
GENERAL ASSEMBLY
For the second
time in three years
France is to be the
host nation to the
United Nations
General Assembly,
whose sixth ses-
sion is scheduled
to open in Paris, at the Palais de ChaiHot, on November 6. It was
here, on December 10, 1948, that the United Nations General Assem-
bly adopted the historic Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
This year it is significant that the Assembly, again meeting in
Paris, will have on its agenda a draft International Covenant on
Human Rights which will ultimately give force to the prin-
ciples enshrined in the Universal Declaration. Through experience
gained in meeting the needs of the-1J48 meetings, the French
Government is putting up additional temporary buildings to house
the Conference and Secretariat working areas. The EifTeI Tower,
as this photograph shows, will make an impressive background
to these new 5-storey prefabricated buildings, so designed that
they can be taken down after lht'Conf"rence and re-erecled
elsewhere. The United Nations Secretariat for the Conference
will comprise some 1, 300 persons while delegations will number
approximately 1, 000. Plenary Sessions of the Assembly will be
held in the Theatre of the Palais de Chaillot which has been con-
verted to provide simultaneous interpretation in the five official
United Nations languages. Next mar, the permanent Assembly
building at U. N. Headquarters in New York is expected to he read-.
