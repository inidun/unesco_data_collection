Presented to Unesco by the Tunisian Government on June 29, 1972, this mosaic once formed
the floor of the dining-room of a 2nd century A.D. Roman house in ancient Thysdrus now
El Djem in Tunisia. Uncovered during excavations carried out in 1961, it measures about 8 ft.
by 5 ft. 6 ins. It is a typical example of Afro-Roman decorative art at a time when the mosaic
technique was at its height. Diana, goddess of nature, water, trees and hunting, is portrayed
framed In a rustic arbour built on rocks from which a spring gushes forth; around her are
depicted lions, gazelles, stags, donkeys and wild bulls. Above, detail of this mosaic.

AUROVILLE: CITY
OF GLOBAL UNITY
This is the model of a 45 by 30 metre
spheroid structure covered with
golden discs that will dominate
the international city of Auroville
now being built near Pondicherry,
in south-east India.
The "Matrimandir", as it is called,
symbolizes the ideal of beauty and
harmony and will be a place for
meditation. Auroville is named after
Sri Aurobindo, the Indian poet and
philosopher, whose work and ideals
inspired the founding of the city.

K.R. SRINIVASA IYENGAR, Indian educator,
author and critic, has made a special study
of the life and philosophical works of Sri
Aurobindo, to whom he devoted his latest
book, 'Sri Aurobindo: a Biography and a
History", published recently In two volumes
at Pondlcherry, India. He was formerly head
of the English Department at Andhra Univer¬
sity (S.E. India) and Its V'Ice-Chancellor be¬
fore his election In 1969 as Vice-President
of the National Academy of Letters in New
Delhi. He has published biographies of Ra-
blndranath Tagore, François Mauriac, Shakes¬
peare and other writers.
AS it just a quirk of fate
that Sri Aurobindo, the Indian philo¬
sopher, poet and patriot whose cen¬
tenary we celebrate this year, was
born 75 years to the day before India
achieved independence?
Aurobindo himself regarded the fact
that his 75th birthday coincided with
the proclamation of an independent
India on August 15, 1947, (our "tryst
with destiny" as prime minister Jawa¬
harlal Nehru called it) "not as a fortui¬
tous accident but as a sanction and
seal of the Divine Power that guides
my steps".
Third son of a surgeon, Aurobindo
received an English education at Lor-
etto Convent School, Darjeeling, India,
and St. Paul's School, London, before
reading classics at Cambridge. Return¬
ing to India in 1893, he accepted ser¬
vice in the Baroda State in western
India, rising to become Vice-Principal
and professor at Baroda College and
later Principal of the new National Col¬
lege in Calcutta.
But with the Indian sub-continent,
which he saw not just as a geogra¬
phical area but as Bharati the Mother,
under foreign domination, Aurobindo
set little store on the easy security
afforded by his teaching career and
embarked on a two-pronged program¬
me of revolutionary action.
At first he was content to exercise
from behind the scenes a long-dis¬
tance control over a secret, nation¬
wide, revolutionary organization that
would be ready when the time came
for armed uprising. Then, in 1906, he
openly entered the arena of nationalist
politics, and as de facto editor of the
Calcutta daily newspaper "Bande
Mataram" he preached the nationalist
cause with missionary fervour.
Already Sri Aurobindo's "Bhavani
Mandir", which in the eyes of the alien
bureaucracy was an incendiary pamph¬
let, was in secret circulation among
young revolutionaries. Now his open
espousal of extremist nationalism
made him the most dangerous man

Unesco's General Conference begins its session on October 17
this year. At its last session in 1970 it invited all Unesco member
states and non-governmental organizations to participate in
this year's centenary of the birth of Sri Aurobindo, the great
Indian spiritual leader and philosopher. An exhibition on Sri
Aurobindo's life and work will be held at Unesco headquarters
in Paris from October 16 to 26. Special ceremonies have taken
place and will take place at Pondicherry, south of Madras on
the east coast of India and on the nearby site of Auroville,
the international city named after Aurobindo. In this issue
published in the international spirit of Unesco's General Confer¬
ence we present articles on the life and teaching of Sri Auro¬
bindo; the traditional music of Africa; a Kirghiz writer speaking
about his country, Kirghizia; the glorious heritage of Taxila
in Pakistan; and finally International Book Year and Unesco

IN THE PATH OF A GREAT SAGE
SRI AUROBINDO
Sri Aurobindo in his 78th year,
a few months before his death in 1950.
in India. Following the killing of the
Pringle-Kennedy ladies at Muzzafer-
pore by two revolutionary hotheads,
Sri Aurobindo was arrested and placed
in solitary confinement in the Alipur
jail On charges of conspiracy.
After a prolonged trial he was
acquitted and released in May 1909.
But during his time in prison Sri Auro¬
bindo underwent a mystic experience .
which decided him to turn his back
on politics and retire ^to the French
settlement at Pondicherry in southern
India for the undisturbed pursuit of
Yoga and spirituality.
In his "Cave of Tapasya" at Pondi¬
cherry, he set about working out the
meaning of the spiritual insights he
had received while in jail. In collabora¬
tion with a French woman, Madame
Mira Richard, who was to become
known as "The Mother", he launched
the monthly philosophical journal
"Arya" and founded the famous Ash¬
ram, or settlement.
Although Madame Richard had to
return to France with the outbreak of
the First World War, Aurobindo kept
the journal going until 1921, publishing
in it in serial form a number of philo¬
sophical treatises such as "The Life
Divine", "The Human Cycle", "The
Ideal of Human Unity", "The Synthesis
of Yoga", "The Secret of the Veda",
"Essays on the Gita", "Foundations
of Indian Culture" and "The Future
Poetry".
Sri Aurobindo's achievement as a
lyricist, dramatist and epic poet must
rank him among the great creative
writers of our time. Yet it is not
merely as a writer and poet, but as a
thinker and prophet that Sri Auro¬
bindo has made his unique impact
upon our age.
In his Independence Day message
of August 15, 1947, Sri Aurobindo
referred to five world movements
with which he had involved himself
and whose fulfilment he hoped for a
free and united India, a resurgent Asia,
an emerging world union, the overflow
of India's spirituality into Europe and
America, and, finally, "a step in evo¬
lution which would raise man to a
higher and larger consciousness". The
last was the most important and was
the theme of "The Life Divine", "The
Human Cycle" and "The Ideal of
Human Unity".
Sri Aurobindo's diagnosis of the
present human predicament is that,
while man's mastery over the outside
world has been growing at an acceler¬
ated pace, his inner development
seems to have halted long ago. Our
environment is changing fast, but the
inner climate has remained the same.
So far only the first three stages of
evolution have emerged, the develop¬
ment from "matter" to "life" and from
"life" to "mind"; but the time has
come for the step forward to the
"supermind" and the "divinisation" of
man and the universe.
Sri Aurobindo died on December 5,
1950, but his work has been continu¬
ed by "The Mother". It was in further-

anee of his vision of the future that
"Auroville", the international "City of
Dawn" was inaugurated in February
1968.
Though nearly twenty-two years
have passed since the death of Sri
Aurobindo, his influence is still keenly
felt, particularly so in this his cen¬
tenary year. He was cast in the hallow¬
ed mould of India's great sages and
Rishis, and it was his destiny to par¬
ticipate in great world movements and
help hasten their fulfilment. He saw
India bound and willed her free; he
saw that man was a creature of infinity
in his aspirations, but a maimed thing
in reality because of the limitations of
egoistic desire, inbuilt incapacity and
the certainty of death.
The Ashram at Pondicherry and
Auroville represent the dynamic phase
of Sri Aurobindo's spiritual philosophy.
They are but mini-worlds, spiritual pilot
projects in which several hundred men,
women and children drawn from most
of the nationalities of the world are
laying the foundations of the "Deva
Sangha" (the Community of Gods) that
Sri Aurobindo envisaged.
The Ashram and Auroville are still
but the beginning of beginnings; no
more than hints and guesses, sketches
and opening bars of music. They are,
if you will, like promissory notes; but
the seal and the signature are Sri
Aurobindo's.

the nationalist movement in which his activities led to a term of imprisonment.
After his release in 1909, he turned his back on politics and retired to
Pondicherry where he founded his "Ashram", or spiritual community.

THE ASHRAM
AT PONDICHERRY
The ¡deals and precepts of Sri
Aurobindo have found expression
in the life and activities of the
spiritual community he created at
Pondicherry, 170 km south of
Madras. From a handful of dis¬
ciples and followers who lived as
members of Sri Aurobindo's house¬
hold, the community, or Ashram,
has grown into a settlement of
1,800 persons seekers after a
life based on spiritual realization.
Community services staffed by its
members now range from weaving
and spinning (photo left) to farm¬
ing, building, handicrafts and metal
work. Handmade paper (bottom
left) feeds the community's print¬
ing press which publishes in
13 languages. Cultural activities
include painting, sculpture, and
music played on traditional Indian
stringed instruments (photo right).
Founded in 1952, the Ashram's
"Sri Aurobindo International Cen¬
tre of Education" today provides
education ranging from kindergar¬
ten to post-graduate studies based
on an experimental "Free Pro¬
gress" method outlined by Sri
Aurobindo.

THE IDEAL
HUMAN
UNITY
Poet, critic, scholar and humanist, Sri Aurobindo was a new type of
thinker whom the London "Times Literary Supplement "has described
as "one who combines in his vision the alacrity of the West with the
illumination of the East. " In 1 914, after four years of spiritual contem¬
plation, he launched a monthly philosophical journal, "Arya" in which
he expressed his vision of man and history, his destiny, and the
progress of human society towards unity and harmony. These treat¬
ises, since published as books, were followed by other major works
from the pen of Sri Aurobindo, including the epic "Savitri", a spirit¬
ual poem of 23,000 lines, and "Mind of Light". The following quo¬
tations are from "The Ideal of Human Unity", which first appeared
in "Arya" in serial form between 1915 and 1918. This treatise and
two other works "The Human Cycle" and "War and Self Determi¬
nation" were recently published under the general title, "Social
and Political Thought", as volume 15 in the Sri Aurobindo Birth
Centenary Library by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry.

<![CDATA[
by Sri Aurobindo
Today the ideal of human unity is more or less making
its way to the front of our consciousness. The ideal... must
certainly be attempted, and is likely to figure largely
among the determining forces of the future; for the intel¬
lectual and material circumstances of the age have prepar¬
ed and almost impose it...
The State and the individual
We must note one fact in connexion with the claim of
the State to suppress the individual in its own interest:
that it is quite immaterial to the principle what form the
State may assume. The tyranny of the absolute king
over all and the tyranny of the majority over the indivi¬
dual... are forms of one and the same tendency. Each
when it declares itself to be the State with its absolute
"L'Etat, c'est moi," is speaking a profound truth even while
it bases that truth upon a falsehood. The truth is that
each really is the self-expression of the State in its cha¬
racteristic attempt to subordinate to itself the free will,
the free action, the power, dignity and self-assertion of the
individuals constituting it. The falsehood lies in the under¬
lying idea that the State is something greater than the indi¬
viduals constituting it and can with impunity for itself and
to the highest hope of humanity arrogate this oppressive
supremacy.
National conscience and individual liberty
A national culture, a national religion, a national educa¬
tion may still be useful things provided they do not inter
fere with the growth of human solidarity on the one side
and individual freedom of thought and conscience and
development on the other.
Human aggregation and living organisms
The administrative, political, economic organization of
mankind in aggregates of smaller or greater size is a
work which belongs at Its basis to the same order of
phenomena as the creation of vital organisms in physical
Nature. It uses, that is to say, primarily external and phy¬
sical methods governed by the principles of physical life-
energy intent on the creation of living forms.
Liberty and justice
Liberty is insufficient, justice also is necessary and
becomes a pressing demand; the cry for equality arises.
Certainly, absolute equality is non-existent in this world;
but the word was aimed against the unjust and unneces¬
sary inequalities of the old social order. Under a just
social order, there must be an equal opportunity, an equal
training for all to develop their faculties and to use them.
The plague of national egoism
War can only be abolished if national armies are abol¬
ished and even then with difficulty, by the development
of some other machinery which humanity does not yet
know how to form or, even if formed, will not for some
time be able or willing perfectly to utilize. And there is no
chance of national armies being abolished ; for each nation
distrusts all the others too much, has too many ambitions

THE IDEAL OF HUMAN UNITY (Continued)
and hungers, needs to remain armed, if for nothing else,
to guard its markets and keep down its dominions, colonies,
subject peoples.
Progress and liberty
... All unnecessary restriction of the few common liber¬
ties man has been able to organize for himself becomes a
step backward whatever immediate gain it may bring; and
every organization of oppression or repression beyond
what the imperfect conditions of human nature and society
render inevitable, becomes, no matter where or by whom it
is practised, a blow to the progress of the whole race.
Diversity and unity
. . .Freedom is as necessary to life as law and regime:
diversity is as necessary as unity to our true completeness.
Existence is only one in its essence and totality; in its
play it is necessarily multiform. Absolute uniformity would
mean the cessation of life, while on the other hand, the
vigour of the pulse of life may be measured by the
richness of the diversities which it creates. At the same
time, while diversity is essential for power and fruitfulness
of life, unity is necessary for its order, arrangement and
stability.
The inner liberty
Nature does not manufacture, does not impose a pattern
or a rule from outside; she impels life to grow from within
and to assert its own natural law and development modi¬
fied only by its commerce with its environment. All liberty,
individual, national, religious, social, ethical, takes its
ground upon this fundamental principle of our existence.
to belittle that to which Nature always attaches so insistent
an importance. On the contrary, the inner and the outer
depend upon each other... The peace, well-being and
settled order of the human world is a thing eminently to
be desired as a basis for a great world-culture in which all
humanity must be united; but neither of these unities, the
outward or inward, ought to be devoid of an element even
more important than peace, order and well-being freedom
and vigour of life, which can only be assured by variation
and by the freedom of the group and of the individual.
The ultimate aim: the spirit
A spiritual religion of humanity is the hope of the future.
By this is not meant what, is ordinarily called a universal
religion, a system, a thing of creed and intellectual belief
and dogma and outward rite. Mankind has tried unity by
that means; it has failed and deserved to fail, because there
can be no universal religious system, one in mental creed
and vital form. The inner spirit is indeed one, but more
than any other the spiritual life insists on freedom and
variation in its self-expression and means of development.
A religion of humanity means the growing realization that
there is a secret Spirit, a divine Reality, in which we are
all one, that humanity is its highest present vehicle on
earth, that the human race and the human being are the
means by which it will progressively reveal itself here. It
implies a growing attempt to live out this knowledge and
bring about a kingdom of this divine Spirit upon earth. By
its growth within us oneness with our fellow-men will
become the leading principle of all our life, not merely a
principle of co-operation, but a deeper brotherhood, a real
and an inner sense of unity and equality and a common
life.
10
Democracy
Democracy is by no means a sure preservative of liberty;
on the contrary, we see today the democratic system of
government march steadily towards such an organized
annihilation of individual liberty as could not have been
dreamed of in the old aristocratic and monarchical systems.
It may be that from the more violent and brutal forms of
despotic oppression which were associated with those sys¬
tems, democracy has indeed delivered those nations which
have been fortunate enough to achieve liberal forms of
government, and that is no doubt a great gain. It revives
now only in periods of revolution and of excitement, often
in the forms of mob tyranny or a savage revolutionnary or
reactionary repression. But there is a deprivation of liberty
which is more respectable in appearance, more subtle and
systematized, more mild in its method because it has a
greater force at its back, but for that very reason more
effective and pervading.
Language and tongues
A common language makes for unity and therefore it
might be said that the unity of the human race demands
unity of language; the advantages of diversity must be
foregone for this greater good, however serious the tem¬
porary sacrifice. But . . . language is the sign of the cul¬
tural life of a people, the index of its soul in thought and
mind that stands behind and enriches its soul in action.
Therefore, it is here that the phenomena and utilities of
diversity may be most readily seized more than in mere
outward things . . . Diversity of language is worth keeping
because diversity of cultures and differentiation of soul-
groups are worth keeping and because without that diver¬
sity life cannot have full play; for, in its absence there is a
danger, almost an inevitability of decline and stagnation.
The inner and the outer
In laying stress on culture, on the things of the mind
and the spirit, there need be no intention of undervaluing
the outward material side of life: it is not at all my purpose
The idea of a world-empire imposed by sheer force is In
direct opposition, as we have seen, to the new conditions
which the progressive nature of things has introduced into
the modern world.
Behind the apparent changes of the most radical revolu¬
tions we see this unavoidable principle of continuity sur¬
viving in the heart of the new order.
In the old phrase his (Man's) business is to learn to live
according to Nature.
Man tries to determine the laws of his mind and life and
body, the law and rule of the facts and forces about him.
The present arrangement of the world has been worked
out by economic forces, by political diplomacies, treaties
and purchases and by military violence without regard to
any moral principle or any general rule of the good of
mankind.
The free individual is the conscious progressive: it is
only when he is able to impart his own creative and mobile
consciousness to the mass that a progressive society
becomes possible.

open
to the world
This model of Auroville, the cultural township being set up by the Sri Aurobindo
Society a few miles north of Pondicherry ¡n India, shows the city of global unity
spread out like a giant nebula with the golden sphere or "Matrimandir" as its focal
point (see page 12). With its four zonesresidential, industrial, cultural and internat¬
ionalAuroville will eventually cover an area of 15 square miles with a population
not exceeding 50,000. In the cultural zone academies of arts and sciences will
welcome artists and scientists from all parts of the world. In the international zone
pavilions of all nations will serve as embassies of the culture, art and handicrafts
of each country. The city's nebular-shaped layout allows for the integration of the
different zones. The foundation stone of Auroville was laid on February 28, 1968,
and the city is expected to take 20 years to complete. Unesco has invited its member
states and non-governmental organizations to participate in the development of
Auroville as an international cultural township "designed to bring together the.
values of different cultures and civilizations in a harmonious environment", and has
been lending its support to the project as a whole.

SPHERE OF UNITY. An overall view of the giant "Matriman-

after completion in a complex of 12 gardens symbolically recalling
the open petals of a lotus flower (see also cover photo caption
page 3). Its golden discs will move gently in the wind and will
cover the concrete walls overlaid with plastic. Pathways from the
gardens pass between walls 30ft. high that will slope down to
form a 12-sectioned crater enshrining the golden ball. Cross-section
of the structure (below), designed by the French architect, Roger
Anger, shows stairways leading to a lower room from which ramps
give access to a 12-sided hall of meditation in this structure of
spiritual unity. At its centre a luminious ball will diffuse light
into both rooms from the top of the structure, which is pierced ver¬
tically down its axis. Opposite, inhabitants of Auroville gather at
the site as it looks at present. The reflections of the sun add an
awe-inspiring note to the scene. The foundations of the Matri-
mandir and the surrounding gardens are being excavated by hand
without the help of mechanical earth-moving equipment.

group on the role of the arts is seen in -the open air patio of the
new structure. Studies are available for persons of various ages

door to a strange world of the unreal
and the invisible, of spirits of every
kind, and marks a belief in the passage
of Man from this life to another,
beyond.
If to many Westerners African music
is little more than a jumble of incohe¬
rence, to the African its rhythms have
a coherence and depth which vary
according to the important events of
life such as birth, illness, recovery,
death.
African music has a cyclical quality,
for it symbolizes the actual life-cycle
of Man. And because it is cyclical, one
must never forget that it is made up of
"micro-cycles" or particles of sound
which are released into the air in the
extremely short musical phrases end¬
lessly hummed or strummed by the
musician, repeated over and over again
to the bewilderment and even the
despair of the European who finally
growls: it's boring and monotonous.
In reality, this apparent monotony is
part of a complex cycle made up of
elements which are vibrantly alive in
the flesh, blood, brain and heart of
the black man. The musical phrase
perceived by the ear is in fact only

one part of an ensemble of perfectly
co-ordinated sounds which nourish the
entire body like the circulation of the
blood.
Continuing the comparison, we
might imagine that from a hole made
at a certain spot in the human body
the mouth in the case of song a
trickle of blood would emerge in a
continuous stream, flow in a circle
outside, and then return through the
same hole to join up again with the
circulation inside the body.
To the African the notion of cycles is
not restricted to the world of sound.
Sculpture and representational art pro¬
vide cyclic motifs whose meanings
have not always been properly un¬
derstood. The snake biting its own
tail, for example, has been interpreted
as portraying the clumsiness of the
most loathsome of reptiles. In fact,
the closed circle thus formed by the
snake represents either the will to
exclude anything extraneous from
a closely circumscribed world, or the
determination to live for ever the
circle being the symbol of continuity,
even within extemely restricted limits
in a world where everything con¬
stantly begins anew.
The "monotony" of black African
music thus takes on a compelling
significance for the educated person,
not only because it can be explained
in philosophical terms but also be¬
cause, even when considered tech¬
nically, it is seen to be the product of
detailed, conscious elaboration.
Some contemporary composers,
particularly in the field of light music,
are in fact increasingly drawing ins¬
piration from the so-called monotony
of Black African music in composing
works whose originality immediately
strikes the listener.
American jazz has already made ex¬
tensive use of this characteristic of
African music. Its famous riffs (1),
have not only contributed to the popu¬
larity of jazz but have also helped
to imprint the jazz repertoire on the
memories of countless listeners.
It should be noted that western clas-

forms still remains one of the chief musical instruments of Black Africa.
sical music, which appears to be deci¬
dedly chary of such monotony, does
everything possible to get round it,
for example by resorting to subter¬
fuges like the fugue. Basically, the
art of the fugue consists in repeating
a usually short phrase at different
points in the scale, the various super¬
imposed repetitions conveying the illu¬
sion of renewal.
Yet when we listen to the music of
Johann Sebastian Bach, we are in the
presence of a phenomenon compar¬
able to that produced by certain forms
of Black African music, the only differ¬
ence being that with the latter we
do not have a single phrase which is
repeated at higher intervals, but an
infinite variety of rhythms on a given
phrase, which recurs again and again.
Frequently the purpose of African
music is action, with the dance not an
end in itself but a kind of transition, a
springboard to help the body fulfil the
mission assigned it. The action is
purely mechanical, since the aim may
be to draw out suffering from a sick
body by the force of music, accom¬
panied by rubbing and massage; or to
plough and sow the land to music,
or harvest the grain or bind up the
dead fittingly for burial.
The action may also be on a much
higher plane, when spirits are invoked
and entrusted with the soul of the
dead man; when a patient is cured
without being touched or given any
medicine except the magical power of
the dance; or when there is singing
and dancing to turn ill-fortune from a
village at the birth of twins.
Throughout the duration of this
music and its spell, thought plays
no part; it stands aside from the
performers' movements as if tempor¬
arily imprisoned. Facial expression
also reflects this inner state: the
mechanical, though not automatic ges¬
tures are performed unsmilingly. A few
minutes later, dancing may pass into
ecstasy.

AFRICAN MUSIC (Continued)
Here one sees the strength of the
music which, eliminating for a time all
power of thought, dictates directly to
the body the movements to be per¬
formed to heal the sick or bring rain
to the crops. Without this extraordi¬
nary power and driving force, many
of the rites of African life would be
impossible.
The instruments with which man tries
to "touch" music an intangible art
are highly prized: lutes, harps and
other stringed instruments plucked by
hand, demonstrate his desire to finger
sound. This explains why stringed
instruments are used for supernatural
ends such as divination, healing and
worship of the gods.
Among the Lemba in the Transvaal,
the Instrument representing the crea¬
tion of the world and the continuation
of the human race is the "sanza",
known also as "deza", a small portable
harpsichord with thin metal plates
plucked by the fingers. Each sound
plucked forth represents the birth of
a child somewhere in the world.
In the same way, among the Fali in
northern Cameroon, two drums beaten
with the bare hands at the moment
of death symbolize the everlastingness
of man, who is for ever born anew,
even if our eyes see his body pass
away. One of the drums symbolizes

danger and misfortune.
the male principle, the other the fe¬
male. The concert of their sounds
gives life to a new being, destined to
replace the one who has just died.
But the real significance of this
symbol is the magical power of sound
drawn forth by the hand of man.
This symbol, incidentally, 'is found in
many African' communities, ranging
from those of the savanna, such as the
Fali, to forest-dwellers such as the
Fang of southern Cameroon or nor¬
thern Dahomey. The instrument used'
by the Fang to accompany epic tales
and legends is the "mvet", a kind of
portable harp or zither with strings
plucked by both hands. The Fang call
the performer "the zither-handler".
The instrument is used to create an
atmosphere of legend to accompany
the story-telling.
The story repertoire draws on ex¬
ploits from ancestral history, or the
lively inventions of mythology, which
continually receive new life from
music. From these sounds touched
by man's hands is born a driving force
which gives legends their strength and
a special status and prestige in the
life of the community. Sounds which
are well-known, yet ever new to the
listener, announce the departure of the

band of warriors led by Ovang-Obam-
O-Ndong for the kingdom of Engong,
where they hope to conquer immorta¬
lity for .all mankind.
Immediately the audience claps its
hands, is carried away and takes part
in the adventures of the long march
and endless wars, which always end
in failure: immortality will never be
accorded to man, despite the warriors'
desperate struggle to conquer it. But
the music keeps hope alive and hints
that, from one evening to the next,
other episodes will follow, giving the
narration its character of a legend of
unending hope, the very image of the
search for eternal life.
African music is not easy to un¬
derstand on account of its formal pat¬
terns, the nature of its sounds and
pitch and also its content. This is why
it will only yield up its secrets and
really influence the universal art of
sound, gradually... but profoundly. It
is music born of a meeting of indivi¬
duals whose collective aim is to inte¬
grate it with the life of their community,
so that against the general background
of life it plays a co-ordinating .and regu¬
lating role, using rhythm as its tool.

can scene, declaims the praises of the
great at the top of his voice, recalls
the victories of the tribe and recounts
many other past exploits, rhythm beats
out the time for both present and
future. For while song fixes action in
the past, rhythm, through the alchemy
of movement, thrusts man towards the
future.
The journey to the next world, which
many believe to be so long-drawn
out, is thus given a stylized pattern by
Africans, with a simplicity some per¬
sons consider childish. Death does
not exist. Life and death are separated
by a wall which is invisible to the liv¬
ing, though the Telem, the predeces¬
sors of the Dogon on the cliffs of
Bandiagara, in Mali, choose to repre¬
sent it through the medium of a sta¬
tuette.
To cross the wall it is not in fact
necessary to see it. It is enough to
know that the wall is very thick, and
that to traverse it the dead man,
as soon as he expires, must take the
form of a needle or a snake with a
body slim enough to slip through, thus
passing from this life to the next.
Hence the thread-like statuettes dis¬
covered in this region of Mali, where
the worship of the dead and funeral
rites figure largely in the life of the
community. Music, choreography and
sculpture, with a variety of masks, play
an active part, all eager to maintain
and represent the idea of man's conti¬
nuity, one which we find also in other
African communities, often very remote
from Bandiagara.
Music is a vital spiritual need and
also a physical one, since it accom¬
panies all the labours and other acti¬
vities of life. Thus we begin to see
some possible purposes for music
which are not often envisaged, so
accustomed are we to thinking only
of its artistic aspects.
African music, comprising songs and
dances to celebrate different occa¬
sions in life, also contains an Impres¬
sive range of pieces devoted entirely
to work: songs or instrumental music
to encourage the worker. This reper¬
toire covers almost 50 per cent of
African ancestral music as a whole,
so it is worth considering more closely
what contribution this music can make
to Africa today, in the context of
development.
African music in the service of
development is an idea to bring a smile
to the lips of a true music-lover, for
whom the world of sound, ethereal and
intangible, is not concerned with the
problems of existence and everyday
life. Today, however, as in the past,
the rural economy of many African
regions Is still given much of its impe¬
tus by the stimulus of music. In the
forests of Africa women work on the
land in groups singing as they work.
Men sing as they fell trees, even in
modern logging camps.
In the savanna, work in the fields is
often carried out to the encouraging
accompaniment of the songs by one or
more "griots". In certain African
societies, the griot is the expert in the
lore of his ethnic group. He learns its
history, customs, laws, ways of think¬
ing, sometimes its magic, always its
music. He is the repository of the
culture of his people, and though his
knowledge is sometimes sketchy, he
is the reference source for an ancient
saying, the name of an ancestor, or
past exploits of the tribe.
Created by man, African ancestral
music lives, as does its creator, with
an eye to the future. It is "traditional"
only is the sense that there is no
better expression to distinguish it
from other kinds of music. Unlike a
tradition, which is petrified, and per¬
haps more appropriate to museums,
it marches on steadfastly towards the
future, destined to revolutionize that
future Jay a revival -of sincerity, by
means of laws which man has not yet
understood and a rhythm whose force
has not yet been sufficiently appre¬
ciated to be properly made use of.
Its subject is man. It recreates life
around legends old as time, as alive
as the huge trunk of the palaver tree
set in its dominating place on the
savanna and imperturbably fulfilling
its centuries-old rôle.
It is like a spring which gradually be¬
comes heady with rhythm and grows
and swells out of all proportions, to
become as mighty as the boiling Con¬
go. It demands to be known, studied
and respected for what it is, not for
what one would like it to be.

KIRGHIZIA
by Chinghis Aitmatov
20
CHINGHIS AITMATOV Is a famous author
from Kirghizia, a Soviet republic In Cen¬
tral Asia. His works are extremely popular
throughout the U.S.S.R. and have been
translated Into some 60 languages. Win¬
ner of two Soviet awards for literature
the Lenin Prize (1963) and State Prize
(1968) he has written extensively about his
own country, which he also represents as
a Deputy In the Supreme Soviet of the
U.S.S.R., the Soviet Parliament in Moscow.
Among his books published in English are
"Tales of the Mountains and Steppes", the
novel for which he was awarded the Lenin
Prize (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1969)
and "Farewell Gulsary" (Hodder and Stough-
ton, London. 1970).
OR the peoples of my
country the fiftieth anniversary of the
formation of the U.S.S.R. is a great
landmark. What we now call a new
historical community the Soviet peo¬
ple is made up of over a hundred
nations, peoples and ethnic groups.
Some of them were at the feudal
stage of development when the Soviet
Union was formed in 1922, others still
lived under very primitive conditions.
In the recent past the numerous peo¬
ples inhabiting this vast country were
worlds apart as regards civilization,
culture and social experience as well
as in their customs and traditions, their
different religions and the different
languages they spoke, so different, in
fact, that they could not understand
each other.
Every people of my country, big or
small, passed in its development
through different stages of history, life
and culture. It took a long time before
they became what they are today.
Every one of our nations has its own
cultural traditions, its spiritual experi¬
ences, which include not only the
general human values in the treasure-
house of mankind, but also specific
features which are the imprint made
by the life that people led during
different periods.
There is probably no single people
whose fate was an easy and happy one,
whose history is not a chronicle of
suffering and woe. This applies fully
to the history of the Turk peoples (the
Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kirghiz, Uigurs and
Turkmen, among others), one of the
most ancient in the world, who in the
5th-8th centuries had reached a high

the land
behind the clouds'
level in the organization of social life
and cultural development.
The runic writing of the Turk peoples
is one of the most ancient written lan¬
guages on the territory of the Soviet
Union. I have In mind the Orkhon
characters, notably the texts of the
Kul Tegina, composed in 717 by Tegin,
the first Turk historian and writer, and
other monuments of early Turk written
culture.
Yet, a bitter fate was in store for
the descendants of these peoples.
Generation after generation had to
fight to preserve its national indepen¬
dence. This continued right up to the
20th century. The great revolution that
swept one-sixth of the planet resolved
that age-old problem and gave these
ancient peoples a new lease on life.
A hundred years ago, Kirghizia, my
homeland, spreading over the moun¬
tainous part of Central Asia, the Ala
Tau, was unknown to the world. Travel¬
lers who had been there told of it as
of a geographic discovery. Now
things have changed.
This change is reflected also in the
new symbol of Kirghizia a girl with a
red scarf on her head reading a book,
pictured against the background of the
snow-topped Ala Tau.
Kirghizia has become part of the
developing civilized world. In our age
technological achievement has become
commonplace. A people's intellectual
culture, the problems it is resolving and
intends to resolve have become the
true criterion of its development.
The long road from the improvised
akyn to the modern philosophical poem,
from patriarchal sagas to the modern
novel, from ornaments to modern paint¬
ing, from folk plays to the theatre and
the cinema, from the komuz to sympho¬
nic music has been travelled by the
Kirghiz people during the years of the
making and consolidation of the Soviet
Union.
Political equality has enabled not
only the Kirghiz people but also all
the nationalities of the Soviet Union to
raise their economy and production to
the modern level, and has brought
about the rapid social and national
renaissance of formerly backward
peoples.

mic reasons. The domination of one
people over others, the way of think¬
ing imposed by one people over
other peoples, led to suppression of
national aspirations, to the extinction
of national languages, which deprived
these nationalities of the right to inde¬
pendent existence by robbing them of
their national and ethnic charac¬
teristics.
A people's immortality lies in its
language. The language of every
people is a general human value.
Every language is a creation of human
genius. We should not hold any lan¬
guage in disdain, no matter to what
people it belongs, no matter what
development it has attained. Given
favourable conditions every language
can attain perfection by internal dev¬
elopment and also by borrowing,
directly or indirectly.
The mother tongue is like a mother
to whom one owes a debt of grati¬
tude, just as one owes such a debt
to one's people, by whom one has been
given life and the greatest gift of all
language. At the same time it is
impossible to develop a national cul¬
ture without drawing actively on the
achievements of other cultures.
HE formation of the
U.S.S.R. was a decisive factor for
progress. The Russian language be¬
came the language for communication
between all peoples inhabiting a vast
multinational country, but at the same
time conditions were created for the
development of national languages,
within the limits of their geographic
and administrative areas: 90 to 99 per
cent of the nationalities in the various
national Republics and autonomous
regions today consider the vernacular
as their mother tongue and use it
extensively.
A written language using the Russian
alphabet was created for peoples who
had no written language, and their
national epics .appeared in print. Many
peoples thus acquired a national lit¬
erature of their own. The artistic level
and creative possibilities of these lan¬
guages can be seen from the fact that
the works of Cervantes, Shakespeare,
Tolstoy, Balzac, Hemingway and many
other great writers have appeared in
them. The Russian language played
the role of an intermediary, of a bridge
linking the cultures of peoples, who
previously had not even known of
each other's existence.
The rise of Soviet culture is the re¬
sult of the flourishing of many national
cultures. In a letter to the world-
famous historian Arnold Toynbee,
N. Konrad, a leading Soviet historian,
wrote: "Our revolution has set us the
task of creating not only a new social
system, but also a corresponding cul¬
tural system. There must be one so¬
cial system for our entire community,
and it must, at the same time, take
into account that every people in our
Union has had and continues to have

its own cultural tradition, that many of
these peoples have a great and long
cultural history of their own... Every
people must have its own culture, and
at the same time the national culture
of every people must form part of the
common culture of Soviet society."
One of our tasks is to strengthen
and develop the national cultures, and
the national economies, for our society
is a dynamically expanding community.
This task has become even more ur¬
gent today in the age of the scientific
and technological revolution, one of
the possible consequences of which
may be standardization and the loss
of individuality. The wisest course
for a State in these conditions is to
preserve, improve and enrich national
languages and national cultures. "The
world is great", as they say in the
East "because it has not discarded a
single grain of sand."
I think Konrad's words contain the
answer to the dilemma facing some of
the small peoples in our time: whether
to preserve their national traditions at
the expense of social progress or to
sacrifice them for its sake. No nation
can be preserved if it is bottled up. To
do so in our time would be an ana¬
chronism.
A nation is subject to change, as
is everything in the world. Every
nation has lost something during its
historical development and gained
other things instead. Only what is
best and most progressive in every
nation is worth preserving and devel¬
oping.
The spiritual make-up of the Soviet
people is marked by features common
to all the country's nationalities, while
national characteristics exist and de¬
velop in forms expressive of universal
human qualities. The emergence of
Soviet man, to whom the diversity of
national traits has given an originality
and wealth of ideas, seems to me to
be one of the most important historical
achievements of the past half century.
WEE have travelled a vast his¬
torical distance in our cognition of
reality, and have created a single mul¬
tilingual and multinational Soviet
artistic culture, one that has absorbed
all the great achievements of peoples
big and small. It was no easy task,
since many nationalities had to pass
from spoken folklore, from patriarchal
epics and sagas to books dealing with
the psychological problems of life in
entirely new historical conditions.
Our culture does not reject the
achievements of preceding cultures.
On the contrary, it accepts and wel¬
comes these multiple facets of human
existence the beauty of national
creation, the original characteristics,
traditions and ways of life engendered
by particular historical, geographical
and cultural conditions.
The national originality of works of
art presupposes the expression of dis
tinctive qualities, specific aesthetic
forms and a particular view of the
world in images that are traditional to
a given culture. But time marches on
and the frontiers of national life ex¬
pand, absorbing the best cultural val¬
ues and traditions of many peoples.
National forms change. They inter¬
act and mutually enrich themselves,
free themselves of what is outdated
and has outlived its usefulness in new
social conditions. But whenever we
speak of the national we are apt to
think only of the past and not to notice
what exists next to us, in the present,
what has been born of our environ¬
ment. Yet, artistic thought always re¬
flected the spiritual state of contempo¬
rary society.
That is why national originality is
not only the aggregate of the national
features reaching back across the
ages. It would be wrong to understand
the national in the patriarchal sense of
the word. The national includes not
only what has been preserved and
time-tested, not only the experi¬
ence of the past, but also all the in¬
novations made by our reality.
The best of our national works of
literature and art generally express
common human ideals and problems as
seen from the viewpoint of Soviet man,
from the views he holds on the social
struggle, on past and present history,
on the individual and society.
National originality is thus seen to
be closely attuned to the internation-

In our difficult world, fraught with
the danger of atomic war, humanism
is the only ray of hope for the human
race. And we firmly believe that in
our society we are advancing towards
it in the proper and most dynamic
way by combining national with inter¬
national interests.

In the hills
of Pakistan
TAXILA: ANCIENT
CENTRE OF THE
by Syed Ashfaq Naqvi
HE earliest traces of human
settlement in Pakistan date from the
Stone Age. Later, the region became
the cradle of many an ancient civiliz¬
ation as shown by the discovery of
such now well-known sites as Mohenjo
Daro, Harappa, Kot Doji, Mainamati,
Mahasthangarh and Paharpur.
Taxila, in the Punjab, 20 miles west
of Rawalpindi, is also one of the
ancient sites which symbolize the rich
cultural heritage of Pakistan.
It lies in the peaceful valley of the
River Haro, a land of bracing air and
sparkling sunshine at the foot of the
snow-capped Murree Hills in the north
of Pakistan. Here, set against the
cool, green landscape, trees and
bushes stand out in their brilliant attire
the "kutchnar" with its gay bonnet
of purple and white blossoms and the
"saimul," a forest giant aglow with
blood-red blooms.
Yet the sweet-smelling orchards and
stretches of green turf seem to attain
their ultimate beauty in the splendid
gardens laid out around the remains,
more than 2,000 years old, of a great
city which attracted the attention of
Alexander the Great of Macedón, and
which later saw the rise of Asoka,
the greatest of the Buddhist kings.
For centuries, Taxila served as a
sanctuary for exhausted travellers
coming from central and western Asia
in search of knowledge or trade. To¬
day, it is a place of pilgrimage for
thousands of tourists who come to

SYED ASHFAQ NAQVI, head of the National
Museum of Pakistan, In Karachi, Is an Inter¬
nationally-known archaeologist and museolo-
gist who has excavated at many Pakistani sites
such as Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa and Taxila.
A noted specialist in the conservation of
monuments he has undertaken special missions
for Unesco at Mohenjo Daro, Venice and
elsewhere. He is the author of many studies
on archaeology, modern museum techniques
and ancient art, Including "The Muslim Art"
(1966); "Gandhara Art" (1967) and "1.400 Years
of Quranic Calligraphy" (in publication).
admire this land of wonder and
enchantment.
Taxila flourished for more than
1,000 years from the 6th century B.C.
onwards, and during this period saw
the rise and fall of at least seven
ruling dynasties. Most of our know¬
ledge about this metropolis is based
on the results of the archaeological
excavations conducted at its three
city-sites dating from different periods,
and over a dozen Buddhist stupas and
monasteries during the past 60 years.
This information, supplemented by the
records of Greek and Chinese writers,
helps us to imagine what a varied
scene Taxila must have presented in
far off times.
In its early days, Taxila was a great
centre of learning and was well known
for its university where the arts and
sciences of the day were taught. It
attracted students from different and
distant parts of the sub-continent and
elsewhere. Numerous references in
the Jatakas (the narratives of former
incarnations of Buddha) testify to this
fact, though Taxila owed its reputation
as a seat of learning above all to its
teachers who were the recognized
authorities on their subjects. It thus
exercised a kind of intellectual suzer¬
ainty over a wide world of letters.
But, let us not confuse it with the
western concept of a university a
much later development. In this early
period, a university consisted of
organized groups of independent
teachers. The same appears to have
been true of Oxford and Cambridge in
their early days.
In the east, "this practice continued
for a much longer period, and places
like Nadwa, Poona and others became
renowned as important centres of
learning due to the spontaneous
grouping of well-known scholars who
had dedicated their lives to the cause
of education.
European travellers of the 17th cent¬
ury also noted a similar state of affairs
at Benares. François Bernier, a
French doctor who spent 12 years in
India at that time, writes: "Benares
was a kind of university, but it had no
colleges or regular classes and
resembled rather the schools of the
ancients, the masters being dispersed
in different parts of the town in private
houses."
It was on this pattern that the famous
University of Taxila also flourished
more than 2,000 years ago, though the
innumerable monastic establishments
where the "world-renowned" teachers
lived and imparted knowledge could,
of course, be taken as the component
parts of a great and sprawling univer¬
sity which covered an area of more
than 26 square miles in the valley of
the Haro.
Early Buddhist literature refers to
the students as going to Taxila to
"complete" their education and not to
begin it. They were invariably sent at
the age of sixteen, that is, when they
"came of age." This shows that
Taxila was a seat of higher learning,
not of elementary education.
The minimum age for admission,
curiously enough, was thus the same
as that prescribed by modern univer¬
sities. Perhaps this age for entry was
fixed to ensure that students coming
from far off places were mature enough
to face the rigours of a long and
difficult journey.
u,'NFORTUNATELY, apart
from these few historical facts, not
much is known about Taxila before its
conquest by Alexander the Great
in 326 B. C. Lavish accounts by
Alexander's companions and con¬
temporaries inspired the descriptions
of later writers of Antiquity. The Greek
historian Flavius Arrian calls it "a large
and wealthy city, and the most
populous between the Indus and the
Hydaspes rivers." According to the
Greek geographer Strabo, it was
"a large city crowded with inhabitants
and with very fertile soil." Pliny
describes it as "a famous city,
situated on a low but level plain,
in a district called Amanda."
Soon after Alexander's departure
from the scene, Taxila was incorporat¬
ed into the Mauryan Empire, and it was
during the days of Asoka that Taxila
rose to a pre-eminent position among
the cities of the north-west. A number
of monasteries and stupas were built
in and around Taxila, and their remains
bear testimony to the days when
Buddhism was the prevailing faith.
With the break-up of the Mauryan
Empire, Taxila appears to have lost its
importance, and its history becomes
chequered.

ORIENT Perched atop a- 300 foot tiill, the monuments of Jaulian, outside Taxila (Pakistan),
have dominated the surrounding countryside since the 2nd century A.D. The buildings,
consisting of a Buddhist monastery with cells for the monks and a main stupa,
were ravaged by fire in the 5th century. The statues surrounding
the commemorative shrine seen in photo show the high degree of skill and artistry
attained by the sculptors of the period. The graceful folds of the drapery enhance
the contours of the bodies and the faces of the figures in meditation
are suffused with an expression of inner peace and serenity.

The
double-headed
eagle of Taxila
TAXILA (Continued)
A tale of three cities
28
The Greeks from Bactria returned
for a short time followed by the invad¬
ing hordes of Scythians. The Parthian
King Gondophares, who is said to
' have played host to Saint Thomas the
Apostle, ruled over the city during the
1st century A.D. The Kushans, under
Kanishka, ruled in the 2nd century A.D.
and then in the 5th century A.D. came
the White Huns, carrying fire and
sword. They overthrew the ruling
dynasty and destroyed the city, leav¬
ing the monasteries and stupas in
ruins and desolation.
The Chinese traveller, Hsuang Tsang,
who visited Taxila in the 7th century
A.D., relates that most of the monu¬
ments had been shattered and Taxila
itself turned into a dependency of
Kashmir. He wrote:
"The Pilgrim returned to Utakahantu
(Udaka Khanda) city, went south
across the Indus, here three on four li
broad and flowing south-west pure and
clear, to the Takshasila country. This
was above 2,000 li in circuit, its capital
being above ten li in circuit. The
chiefs were in a state of open feud,
the royal family being extinguished;
the country had formerly been subject
to Kapias but now it was a dependency
of Kashmir. It had a fertile soil and
bore good crops, with flowing streams
and luxuriant vegetation; the climate
was congenial; and the people, who
were hard-working, were adherents of
Buddhism. Although the Monasteries
were numerous, many of them were
desolate, and the Brethren, who were
very few, were all Mahayanists."
During the course of excavations in
this green valley of the River Haro,
three distinct city-sites and a number
of monasteries and stupas have been
discovered by archaeologists. The
first city site, known as "Bhir Mound,"
flourished before the arrival of the
Greeks. It is situated on a small
plateau past the Tamra Nala, a
seasonal stream.
The layout of the city is very hap¬
hazard, the streets narrow and the
plans of the houses irregular. In the
earlier periods, the houses appear to
have been built of rubble and stone
supported by timber which has now
disappeared. In the later stages of
the city, however, kanjur has been
used freely in the construction.
The second city of Taxila which was
founded by the Bactrian Greeks in the
2nd century B.C., and the remains of
which are now found on the western
spurs of the Hathial Ridge, is known
as Sirkap. It was enclosed by a
stone-built city wall about three and
a half miles long.
It is very well planned, the houses
being grouped into square blocks with
straight wide streets cutting each other
at right angles. In planning this city,
Greek principles of defence appear to
have been kept in mind, by including a
considerable area of hilly ground
within its perimeter.
The third city site, which dates back
to the early Kushan times, is laid out
in the traditional Central Asian style
of that age. It is situated to the north¬
east of Sirkap and forms a rough

The invasions that marked the beginning of the 2nd century B.C.
left Taxila destroyed and beyond restoration. The Bactrian Greeks,
who settled at Taxila at this time, transferred the city centre to a
new site at Sirkap to the north-east. Protected by a wall some
6 yards wide, the new city enclosed many temples of which one
of the finest is that of the double-headed eagle (below and detail
left). Similar to those found In early Babylonian and Hittite
sculptures, the double-headed eagle may have been introduced at
Taxila by the Scythians. Despite the Greek presence Buddhism
continued to flourish, as this head of Buddha (right) with its
expression of calm peace and its gentle benevolent smile testifies.

parallelogram, about three miles in
length. The material used in the
construction was again stone.
Along with these three city-sites, a
number of Buddist monasteries and
stupas are scattered over this wide
area. The devotees appear to have
taken special care in selecting the spot
for their places of worship and devot¬
ion. These are beautifully situated on
hill tops overlooking the valley or in
secluded places.
One of the most important structures
here is the Dharmarajika Stupa, built
by the Buddists to enshrine relics of
the Buddha or of one of the Buddhist
saints. The construction of a stupa
was regarded as a work of great merit
which brought the builder a step near¬
er to salvation.
The Dharmarajika Stupa is circular
with a raised terrace reached by a
flight of four steps. It is faced with
limestone blocks and appears to have
been originally coated with lime-plaster
and paint. The terrace served as a
processional path for the monks.
Around this great stupa are many
smaller ones. It was here, in 1917,
that a casket was found which contain¬
ed the relics of Buddha. This was
presented by the then Viceroy of India
to the Buddhists of Ceylon and has
since been enshrined in the Temple of
the Tooth at Kandy.
The other important stupa com¬
memorates the pious memory of Kunala,
the son of Asoka the Great, and
Asoka's Viceroy to Taxila. Kunala's
stepmother, Tishyarakshita, had fallen
in love with him, but having failed to
entice the handsome young prince, she
managed to forge a royal decree
ordering Kunala to be blinded. When
the order reached Taxila, the king's
ministers were loath to execute this
cruel punishment, but Kunala brave¬
ly submitted to what he believed were
his father's orders. When Asoka, who
had never issued such a decree, learn¬
ed what had been done, he became
enraged and finding the culprit was
his own wife, he put her to death.
This stupa marks the site where
Kunala's eyes were put out It stands
on a rectangular base of 63 feet from
east to west by 105 feet from north to
south and commands a striking view
of the valley. Of its imposing super¬
structure not much remains, and we
have to visualize most of its past
grandeur from the parts of the beauti¬
ful Corinthian pilasters with an elab¬
orate moulding surmounted by a
dentil cornice and coping which still
remain. The delicate concave curvature
of its 'plinth, is another remarkable
feature of this monument.
The stupa and monastery of Mohra
Moradu are situated at a picturesque
site about a mile to the south east of
Sirsukh. At the time of excavation,
nothing but a portion of the ruined
dome was visible. But as the earth
was removed, there emerged one of
the most spectacular ensembles of
Buddhist architecture.

TAXILA (Continued)
Cultural meeting place of East and West
Here, most of the stucco reliefs and
images are well-preserved and reveal
a high standard of art. The figures
are particularly endowed with life and
movement and there are traces of
colour which once embellished them.
Pippala, Jaulian, Bhamala and Giri are
other interesting stupas and monas¬
teries in this vicinity which preserve
relics of Buddhist art.
In these Buddhist sculptures, the
arts of East and West are harmonious¬
ly blended. Outstanding examples are
the seated and standing statues of
Bodhisattvas and of the Buddha, in
which particular attention has been
paid to the lines of the face, the
contours of the body, and the free-
flowing and natural drapery. The
artist has tried to make the body
visible through its folds. Here, the
principle of naturalness has been
accepted and the human form perfect¬
ed in every detail.
A brief description of some of the
features of these sites and the art they
enshrine, cannot convey a true idea of
the variety and extent of the cultural
remains of Taxila. Much more has to
be seen' and examined if one is to
visualize the life of the people in those
far distant days. The large quantities
of jewellery, coins, statues and
domestic utensils which have been
discovered at Taxila and which are
now preserved in the site museum
can do much to help us to form a
picture of the culture which once
existed there.
The jewellery which is made of gold
and silver inlaid with stones, comprises
pendants, necklaces, girdles, amulets,
bangles, brooches and hairpins. It is
distinctively Greek or Graeco-Roman
in design and the technical processes
of moulds and dies employed are the
same as those found throughout the
Graeco-Roman world. The granulated
and filigree work is the most attractive
feature of the Taxila jewellery.
The coins discovered here are many
and -varied and throw light on almost
Excavations at Sirkap, site of the second ancient
city of Taxila, have revealed its well-planned
chessboard pattern of square buildings and straight
wide streets laid out within a perimeter wall three
miles long. The most important building unearthed,
the royal palace (350ft. by 400 ft.), has audience
halls and grey sandstone columns. This poster
at the entrance to Sirkap recalls the dynasties that
ruled the city during four centuries.

Excavations near Taxila brought
to light the shrine and monastery
of Mohra Moradu, a spectacular
ensemble of Buddhist art
and architecture. Among
the reliefs and images was

Maitreya set on a pedestal.

all the phases of Taxila's history. The
majority were minted by the local
autonomous kings of the city, the
Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushans,
and a smaller number of coins of the
Greek kings have also been uncovered.
The earliest coins found are the silver
bars with a wheel-like symbol belong¬
ing to the fourth century B.C.
The pottery which has been unearth¬
ed at the different sites of Taxila is
essentially utilitarian in character.
It ranges from capacious storage jars
for oil and wine to cooking pots,
bowls, saucers, pans and spouted and
perforated vessels.
As in the case of other arts, pottery
was marked by foreign influences.
The early wares are rather simple in
shape and decoration, but with the
arrival of Greeks and Parthians, new
forms appear to have been introduced,
including beautiful amphoras, handled
jugs and flared beakers. In the
treatment of the surface and the decor¬
ation of the pottery also, a change is
visible with the introduction of an
attractive lustrous varnish and emboss¬
ed designs.
Among the terracotta and clay
objects, a large variety of sacred and
mundane figurines, toys of different
shapes and personal ornaments have
been found. These objects are mostly
kiln-baked and show a remarkable
freedom and freshness of modelling
work in clay. During excavations, a
large number of bone, ivory, shell,
glass, copper and bronze objects have
also been found in the shape of per¬
sonal ornaments and articles of house¬
hold use.
Of special interest are the seals and
sealings found here which display the
most exquisite artistry. These were
intended for practical use rather than
as ornaments. On them are beautifully

engraved subjects of a religious or
quasi-religious order, most often in
typically Hellenistic style.
Sir John Marshall, the British
archaeologist, has rightly observed
that, "as with architecture so with the
plastic and other arts, they, one and
all, derived their inspiration from the
Hellenistic School, and in the very
slowness of their decline, bear testi¬
mony to the remarkable persistency of
its teachings."
Yet, in spite of these foreign influ¬
ences, the jewellery, seals and the
statues from Taxila show that the
city's crafsmen were no mere
imitators, but gave rich expression to
their own originality and genius.
UNESCO
publisher
to the
whole world
slick paperback with the
frightening title Planet in Peril? went on
sale during May in bookshops around the
world.
Written by Raymond F. Dasmann, senior
ecologist for the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN), Planet in Peril? was
commissioned and prepared by Unesco.
It is published and distributed jointly by
Penguin Books of London, World Publish¬
ing of New York and Unesco, through
its network of agents.
The striking jacket of the American
edition, black with a moon-shot photo of
the earth looking as green and decaying
as overdone Roquefort cheese, would
stand out on a bookstore display any¬
where, and "Planet" is expected to enjoy
widespread commercial success.
This is not the first Unesco book
destined for the broad general public,
but it is the most recent example of an
increasing trend in this direction.
Up until now, the great majority of
Unesco books and periodicals were intend¬
ed for specialists. The recently published
Origin of Homo Sapiens, for instance,
one of four volumes in the "Ecology and
Conservation" series, deals with what is
perhaps the most intriguing ecological
question of all: that of the origin of man
and the interrelations between it and
environmental changes. But it was written
by experts basically for experts who are
already informed and convinced of the
urgency of the problem. Unesco now feels
that this readership is not broad enough,
especially in an area so vital as pollution.
Of the eleven periodicals published by
Unesco, only the Unesco Courier is for
general circulation and has over two million
readers in its twelve language versions.
Most of the others are Intended for spe¬
cialists (Museum, The Unesco Bulletin for
Libraries, etc.) but some like Impact of
BETTY WERTHER, of the U.S.A., was formerly
a staff member of the United Nations and
is now a free-lance writer and journalist.
by Betty Werther
Science on Society, International Social
Sciences Journal or Prospects (a quarterly
review of education) also appeal to the
educated general public.
The fact of aiming more and more
at this category of readers does not
mean, however, that Unesco intends to
go into competition with the big commer¬
cial publishing houses.
"It would be impossible," says Peter
Thorp, director of distribution for Unesco's
Documents and Publications Bureau. "Our
role is to reflect the Unesco programme,
to spread ideas, while the dominant need
of a private publisher is to make money.
Therefore, we will always be non-commer¬
cial."
Still, Unesco's publishing operation has
most of the characteristics of a major
publishing house. Sales of Unesco books
and periodicals, which may be ordered
through any bookseller or direct from a
national distributor in member countries,
come to over $2,000,000 per year. In
this year's compact, copiously annotated
catalogue, 500 titles are available in
English, French and often in Spanish
versions. The greatest proportion of these
is concerned with education, although an
increasing number fall into science and
culture categories.
This tendency directly reflects the chang¬
ing priorities of the Unesco programme.
In the early days, the late 1940s and 1950s,
when a large part of the organization's
activities was devoted to cultural exchange,
Unesco put itself on the publishing map
with a series of 23 luxury art albums,
many of which are now out of print,
presenting little-known art treasures.
Published in six languages, under the
imprint of the New York Graphic Society,
these revealed artistic treasures such as
those of Cyprus, Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Australia. Much of the same material
was subsequently re-printed in cheap
pocketbook editions. With the same
objectives in mind, Unesco later under¬
took what continues to be one of its
most useful artistic aids the Catalogue
of Reproductions of Paintings which en¬
ables countries with little or no access

UNESCO, PUBLISHER TO THE WORLD (Continued)
ibleto original art to procure the best possi
representation.
With few exceptions, Unesco now leaves
the publication of art books as such lar¬
gely in the hands of commercial publishers.
Unesco goes beyond simple presentation
of our artistic heritage to consider a
more penetrating analysis of the role and
functions of art in society in works such
as The Arts and Man, or the 6-volume
Man through His Art published for the
World Confederation of Organizations of
the Teaching Profession with the co-opera¬
tion of Unesco.
Unesco books fall roughly Into three
categories: reference, publications for
specialists, and those destined for the
general public. Particularly In this last
category, about 1 book in 10 is published
as a co-imprint or a Joint-publication with
outside publishers.
One might easily say that the chief
difference between Unesco and other
publishing houses is in the area of refer¬
ence books where the organization can
carry out projects which no private
publisher could possibly undertake. The
Unesco Statistical Yearbook is an obvious
case In point.
The World Survey of Education is also
a veritable monument of its kind. In fact,
Its five volumes total a combined weight
of some 45 kilos (100 pounds). It costs
Unesco more to produce than its $40
($50 In cloth cover) selling price, and for
a private publisher, even if he could obtain
all the information included, which is unli¬
kely, the cost would be prohibitive.
A recent example of a book which only
Unesco, by its unique position, could
conceive and publish Is Learning to be,
a report of the International Commission
on the Development of Education presided
by Mr. Edgar Faure, a former French
Minister of Education. This book is a
blueprint for the progress that education
must achieve if it is to fulfil its new role
In the world today. It is a book for
everyone Interested in the upbringing of
children and young people everywhere.
(See the November 1972 issue of the
"Unesco Courier" on this subject.)
Other books emphasize the growing
Importance of education as a life-long
process, a subject which also goes beyond
the limited circle of experts and techni¬
cians.
w,
32
HAT the World Survey of
Education is to educators, another sizeable
volume (819 pages plus tables) is to social
scientists. Entitled Main Trends of Re¬
search In the Social and Human Sciences
this intensive study by scholars of world
renown started appearing in 1970. It not
only constitutes a report on the main
trends of research, but, in the words of
Claude Lévi-Strauss, the distinguished
social anthropologist, "aims at Identifying
the paths on which the science of
tomorrow may embark". With the stu¬
dent's purse in mind, separate chapters
of this major volume have been or are being
translated for publication in low-cost
pocket-book editions in many languages.
Another typical example of something
which probably only Unesco could do
is the Index Translationum, an annual
International bibliography of translations.
Begun In 1950 with 8,750 items, It Is now
in its 23rd volume and contains data on
41,322 titles in 73 countries (see p. 35).
The Index can answer questions such as:
What country leads in the number of
translations? Who are the world's most
translated authors? In how many langua¬
ges does the Bible appear?
"Only Unesco can request and obtain
this kind of Information", says Mr. Thorp.
"Any private publisher would come up
against a barrier. We have the necessary
lines of communication. Thus it seems
evident that If Unesco decided to drop
publication, the Index would probably
simply disappear."
u
NESCO also has its best¬
seller list of books which, now fully amortiz¬
ed, are making a comfortable profit which
can be fed back into the organization's
publications' fund.
Topping the list by a run-away margin
is the Unesco Source Book for Science
Teaching which is heading towards one
million copies sold. The history of this
popular manual goes back to the post-war
period when Unesco sponsored a small
volume entitled Suggestions for Science
Teachers in Devastated Countries. While
proving useful in these areas, the book
has also been a considerable success in
all regions of the world where previously
there had been little or no low cost
equipment for practical science teaching.
The revised edition thus became the
first edition of the now well known Source
Book , for Science Teaching which has
been translated into 30 languages and
reprinted 23 times. Consisting of ideas
contributed by teachers all over the world,
it makes use of common and widely
available resources and materials for the
construction of simple scientific equipment
and for the devising of simple scientific
activities.
Another widely used book is Study
Abroad. Updated periodically like a
Michelin Guide, it now provides infor¬
mation on international scholarships and
courses for 126 countries and territories.
Here again because of the use of Unesco
resources, Study Abroad and its sister
volume Vacation Study Abroad can be
priced at a reasonable level with students
and low-budget libraries In mind.
One of the most rapidly expanding areas
of Unesco activity over recent years has
been the production of scientific maps.
Individual countries draw up their own
geological and other maps and atlases,
each, using its own set of rules. So
Unesco's World Geological Atlas Is a
pioneering venture, the first concerted
attempt to map the world using a stan¬
dardized International "language" which
can be "read" anywhere.
Celebrating a quarter century of activity,
a thick cumulative catalogue entitled
25 years of Unesco Publishing is now
being completed. It will contain refer¬
ences to some 5,000 to 6,000 titles
ranging from those for which Unesco was
sole publisher to others in which the
organization participated jointly or, again,
played a more remote role such as simply
sponsoring a certain work or providing a
small grant.
Occupying an important part of the
catalogue will be books published under
the "Unesco Programme for Literary Trans¬
lations". These books, most of which are
translations into English or French, derive
from 60 different literatures, corresponding
to some 40 Asian and 20 European lan¬
guages, not to mention the non-Slavic
literatures of the Soviet Union and many
African literatures.
Through this programme, the Greek
poet George Seferls was brought to the
attention of English-speaking readers in
1960 three years before he received the
Nobel Prize for Literature. The same
prize was awarded to the late Japanese
novelist Yasunarl Kawabata whose Snow
Country (Yukiguni) was one of the first
translations published in 1956 in the
Unesco series of contemporary works.
The current widespread Interest in Japa¬
nese literature in the world today is due
in no small measure to Unesco's efforts
in making both classic and modern works
available in the western world.
These books are all published by private
firms.
"You might say that, here, Unesco
comes in to prime the pump" says
Mr. Thorp. "We want to see a certain
work published, so we assume part of the
financial risk involved. We may take care
of the translation or even share print costs.
In any case, were it not for Unesco, the
great majority of these books probably
would have remained virtually unknown."
Unesco can also, and, indeed, feels
compelled to undertake certain other pro¬
jects private firms would hesitate to tackle
alone. Into this category falls a series of
booklets on the "Race Question in Modern
Science" (later published In a collective
volume under the title of Race and Science)
and Apartheid (a Study of its Effects on
Education, Science, Culture and Informa¬
tion). Widely distributed by the co-pub¬
lishers and Unesco, both titles have
become very successful publications.
To quote another example, it was not
easy to find a commercial publisher for the
joint publication of Birthright of Man, an
anthology of over 1,000 texts asserting
man's birthright over the ages. Marking
the 20th anniversary of the Universal Decla¬
ration of Human Rights, it nonetheless
sold 15,000 copies in English and French.
Since then, three other language versions
have been published or are in course of
preparation and there are more to come.
I INALLY, if one were asked
to select a single work as constituting
Unesco's most significant contribution over
a quarter-century of publishing, a reason¬
able choice, and one best exemplifying
the Unesco spirit, might be the History of
Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Develop¬
ment which Is the first genuinely Interna¬
tional account of the scientific and cultural
history of the world.
Already issued by major publishers (or
In course of production) In nine countries
and in eight different languages, with a
print order of 100,000 sets, History of
Mankind was written by experts of world¬
wide reputation who sufficiently contained
their differences to produce an agreed
version of a world view of human destiny.
Negotiations are now being conducted by
Unesco publishing services for low-priced
paperback editions of this work, necessa¬
rily expensive in Its six-volume, Illustrated
original edition.
Encouraged by the success of the
History of Mankind, Unesco Is now pre¬
paring the publication, on the same pattern,
of the first General History of Africa in
eight volumes. The first volume will
probably be issued in 1974 In hard-cover,
and later paperback versions will appear
in different language versions.
This text is a revised and edited version
of a text which first appeared In "Unesco
Features" (No 625 - July 1972) Unesco's
fortnightly bulletin for press, radio and
television.

Sammy Davis Jr.
stars in Unesco gala
for the blind
Sammy Davis Jr., the Internationally famous American singer and entertainer,
is to give a benefit performance on behalf of the Unesco "Books for the Blind"
programme. As this Issue went to press, the gala was scheduled to take place
on September 25, at the Olympia Theatre in Paris. The show, jointly sponsored
by Unesco and the U.S. National Commission for Unesco, is part of a large scale
fund-raising effort launched for International Book Year.
Sammy Davis Jr., actor, singer, dancer, author, comedian and film producer,
was recently appointed a member of the Unesco Commission in the United States.
His appointment to this body reflects the great contribution to performing arts
he has made over the past decades. In a letter to Unesco's Director-General,
René Maheu, he wrote: "The occasion this affords me to contribute my services
to Unesco is one of the more rewarding aspects of my appointment." Speaking
of "Books for the Blind", he said: "I can think of no more worthwhile endeavour
than the contribution my forthcoming benefit performance will make to this most
worthy of Unesco projects." Sammy Davis Jr., whose Injuries in a motor accident
caused the loss of his left eye, is widely known for his efforts to aid the under¬
privileged and ease racial tensions.
"Books for the Blind" is part of the Unesco Gift Coupon Programme, a
combined educational and fund-raising undertaking,' and is carried out In co-opera¬
tion with the World Council for the Welfare of the Blind. The proceeds from
the Sammy Davis Show will be used to provide Braille books and other educa¬
tional materials for blind people, especially blind children in the developing
countries. The total blind population of the world is estimated at 16 million
persons.
Indian Council
of Peace Research
An Indian Council of Peace Research has
recently been formed in New Delhi under
the chairmanship of Dr Prem Kirpal, chair¬
man of Unesco's Executive Board, to
promote peace research in India and the
developing countries. Its initial programme
includes research for promoting the cause
of non-violent social order and studies on
peace and conflict in the context of social
growth and cultural development. Dr Kirpal
is founder and president of another new
Indian organization, the Institute of Cultural
Relations and Development Studies, in
New Delhi.
Spotlight on African culture
Two recent International meetings have
studied ways of giving wider diffusion to
African culture. The aim of the 2nd Ros¬
trum of African Music, organized in Venice
by the International Music Council, was to
encourage radio stations to make tradi¬
tional African music better known. In
Dakar, Senegal, cultural directors of Afri¬
can radio and television services examined
with specialists from centres recording oral
traditions of Africa how better use can
be made of Africa's cultural resources.
International Fair Play Trophy
Swiss long-jump champion Meta Antenen
was recently awarded the international
Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy, at
Unesco's Paris headquarters, for an act
of sportsmanship during the 1971 European
championships at Helsinki. Rival long-
Jumper Ingrid Mickler-Becker had to take
part in the 100 metres relay while the
long-jump heats were In progress. Miss
Antenen insisted that she be allowed more
than the regulation time to recover and
Miss Mickler-Becker went on to take the
European title. Certificates were also
awarded to British cyclist John Clewarth,
footballers Paul Courtin of France and
Steve Kember of Great Britain and to
French tennis-player Jean-Loup Rouyer.
Soil map of the world
A soil map of South America, recently
issued, by Unesco and the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization, marks the first
step in the publication of a ten-volume
Soil Map of the World. Prepared with
the aid of 13 South American governments,
the new map could be a major Instrument
for agricultural planning in that continent.
With legend in English, French, Spanish
and Russian, the map is available from
Unesco, in Paris, or Unesco Sales Agents
(see p. 35) price $24 (map with 200 pp.
Eng. or Spanish text), separately. $12 each.
School for disarmament
The fourth summer course of the Interna¬
tional School on Disarmament and Re¬
search on Conflicts was held recently at
the Carlo Ederle College, in Padua, Italy.
Subjects under discussion included the
relationship between strategy theories and
the arms race, the limitation of strategic
arms, the political problems of disarma¬
ment and international law, and the theory
of conflicts. The school was founded in
1966 by Carlo Schaerf, professor of Phy¬
sics at the Faculty of Biological Sciences
of Rome University and Edoardo Amaldi,
professor of Physics at the University's
Institute of Physics.

Letters to the Editor
UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY
IN ITALY
Sir,
On pages 4 and 12 of the May 1972
issue of the "Unesco Courier", devoted
to underwater archaeology, mention is
made of the exploration of sites on the
Isle of Capri, at Spargi, Albenga and
Lake Neml, but no indication is given
that this work was carried out by teams
of Italian archaeologists.
The underwater exploration of the
Blue Grotto, on the isle of Capri, was
carried out in 1964 by Professor Alfon¬
so de Franciscis, Director of Antiquities
of Naples, with the assistance of naval
divers. The exploration and scientific
recovery of Roman ships at Albenga
and Spargi was done by the Experi¬
mental Centre for Submarine Archaeo¬
logy, established in 1957 by the Italian
Ministry of Education. The Centre had
at its disposal a vessel loaned by the
Italian Navy; it now has its own vessel,
the "Cycnus", which was also used
in 1970 for exploratory work in Spain.
The formidable task of lowering the
level of Lake Nemi, near Rome, by
27 metres, in order to raise the two
"floating palaces" of the Roman emp¬
eror, was undertaken in 1928 by engi¬
neers, technicians and archaeologists
of the Italian Government.
The exploration of the Marzamemi
site, off the coast of Sicilv was carried
out by German (G. Kapitän) and Ameri¬
can volunteers, supervised by Professor
Barnabo Brea, Director of Antiquities
of Eastern Sicily.
Many other underwater archaeologi¬
cal explorations, besides those mention¬
ed in this issue of the "Unesco
Courier", have, of course, been under¬
taken by Italian experts, as, for example,
the work at Giannutri, near the island
of Elba, in 1963, which led to great
progress in the techniques of mapping,
raising and recovery of wrecks. The
work at Albenga is being continued by
regular expeditions each year.
Prof. Nino Lamboglia
Director, International Institute
for Ligurian Studies and of the
Experimental Centre for Submarine
Archaeology, Bordighera, Italy
ORGANIC FARMING
Sir,
I don't know whether a ban on agri¬
cultural chemicals will lead to famine,
but I am quite sure that their continued
use will.
Has Dr. Norman Borlaug (author of
"In Defence of DDT", "Unesco Cou¬
rier", February 1972) not heard about
the results obtained by organic farming.
An experimental farm at Haughley in
England has harvested 60 to 70 quintals
of wheat and barley per hectare, using
only vegetable compost on the land.
I know one farmer who has had
55 quintals per hectare, after using
these organic methods for only three
years.
In a recent laboratory experiment,
rats fed on wheat produced on land
fertilized by compost were found to be
much healthier than others fed on wheat
grown with chemical fertilizers.
I admit that DDT has given us a
respite in the fight against malaria, but
if we continue to use an arsenal of
chemicals instead of using a basic
approach by building up resistance
with food obtained from a balanced
soil the malaria problem will never be
eradicated.
Organic farming is the right answer
for the developing countries. Put com¬
post on the Savannah instead of burn¬
ing it; draw nitrogen from the air instead
of buying It in sacks here is the
secret of productivity.
Jean Metralle!
Annecy, France
PACKAGED POLLUTION
Sir,
After reading your stimulating issue
on pollution (July 1971), I would like
to point out one crucial factor in the
despoiling of nature: the proliferation
of modern packaging. Don't you think
it would be well worthwhile to launch
a campaign against the excessive use
of packaging?
To deploy vast technical .resources
and to spend huge sums of money to
produce packaging materials that are
often used for only twenty-four hours
is a- gross waste. It Is an abuse of
nature to cut down forests to produce
paper which then has to be re-absorbed
by nature in the form of rubbish. To
destroy forests, pollute rivers and the
atmosphere, expend money and resour¬
ces merely so that we can have a packet
of spaghetti wrapped up In a piece of
paper or plastic Is quite unwarranted!
R. Hugues Blanc
Neuilly-sur-Seine, France
RENDER UNTO CAESAR
Sir,
May I call your attention to a his¬
torical slip in the article entitled "Book,
Dear Friend", ('Unesco Courier", July
1972).
The article states: "It Is said that
Alexander presented Cleopatra with
200,000 manuscripts from the library of
Pergamum". It was, of course, Antony
who did so, not Alexander.
Abdel Moneim El-Sawi
Managing Editor
Arabic Edition, Unesco Courier
Cairo, Egypt
'SOS MANKIND'
Sir,
"Save Angkor, save South-East Asia,
save mankind" should have been the
theme, if not of the main article, then
at least of one of those published in
the "Unesco Courier" issue, "SOS
Angkor" (December 1971).
I support unconditionally all who seek
to preserve the great monuments and
priceless cultural treasures that human
genius has created, all who stand up
for the defence of such values. Rome,
Venice, Egypt, Greece indeed must be
preserved, but so also must paintings,
sculptures and architectural treasures
wherever and whatever they may be, if
we are to "preserve our cultural links
with the past", as your author Hiroshl
Daifuku puts it, and maintain historical
"identification and continuity". Yet one
monument to be saved has escaped the
attention of the authors writing in this
issue the foremost monument of all:
mankind.
The effort now deployed in the battle
against the destroyers of temples and
other wonders of human creativity must
be increased to the nth degree and
thrown Into the battle against crime,
war and genocide in whatever form and
place it occurs.
Francisco Ventura Arredondo
Havana, Cuba
UTOPIAN OR REALISTIC?
Sir.
I was sorry to see Mr. Y. Chabrier's
somewhat cynical letter (ending "Please
spare us from the inept 'if onlys' of
Utopian dreamers") concerning Philip
Noel-Baker, which appeared in your
January 1972 issue.
Apart from the fact that Mr. Noel-
Baker has worked indefatlgably for
peace for many years (for which he
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
for 1959) it is imperative that the idiot
world should be reminded of its incred¬
ible fatuities and lost opportunities
from time to time. Without these
reminders people (such as your corres¬
pondent) tend to become lost in pessi¬
mism and may even be convinced that
the way the world is run is quite
reasonably sane.
If it is Utopian to point to the stupi¬
dities of "statesmen" and the world
that might have been, we might as well
wind up the United Nations and pray
for an early end.
W.J. Barnes
Orpington, England
SPARE A PENCIL
Sir,
During a very interesting visit to five
East African countries earlier this year,
I was particularly impressed with the
children and young people I came
across and their keenness to learn.
One thing they valued and appreciated
more than anything else . was pencils.
Paper books were provided in the
schools but the children had to buy
their own pencils. Would it be possible
for Unesco to organize collections of
pencils (there must be quantities of
part-used pencils In offices and schools
and homes all over the world that are
just thrown away), and have them sent
to schools for the children in countries
where pencils would be appreciated?
Gabrielle Black
Derby, England
HOMAGE TO LOUIS PASTEUR
Sir,
As a reader who has enjoyed the
"Unesco Courier" for over 12 years,
may I suggest that you recall the life
of Louis Pasteur, whose 150th birthday
anniversary falls on December 22, 1972.
The outstanding moral and scientific
qualities of this great scientist as well
as the direct and indirect results of his
work that benefit all mankind deserve
to be acknowledged by a magazine
such as the "Unesco Courier".
