Detail from Family of Country People, an oil painting attributed to one of three 17th century French
painters, the brothers Le Nain. The artist (probably Louis Le Nain) has captured the intense curiosity, the
silent bewilderment, the enigmatic look of appraisal of a child born into a world in which nothing is
made to his dimension. The complete canvas, which measures 1.33 x 1.59 metres (see reproduction
page 34), was discovered at an auction held in Paris in 1914. It is now preserved in the Louvre Museum.

Cover
In 1979, International Year of the Child, what
is the impact of the media on young people
living in different parts of the "global village"
created by modern methods of mass
communication? This issue of the Unesco
Courier looks at the influence on children of
books, school manuals and films and devotes
special attention to the widaly-debated
question of whether television is playing a
beneficial or harmful role in the development
of the child's personality, ideas and
behaviour. Cover shows "television" as seen
by a nine-year-old French child (see page 7).

As television has become a worldwide force, its impact on
children's ideas and behaviour has generated growing concern
and controversy. In some quarters, optimism about TV's
potential has turned sour. Others believe that the medium is
often unjustly attacked as a scapegoat for the ills of an
increasingly complex world and that TV should be seen in a more
balanced perspective as only one of many factors which interact
in the development of the child.

by James Halloran
IN most western countries children spend a great deal of time in
front of the television set, be it in the general living room, a
special recreational room, or their own bedroom. In some
relatively affluent areas there may be three or more television sets
in the same home, and there are reports of children spending more
time watching television than they spend in school, and certainly
more than they spend talking to their parents.
Clearly, a medium which attracts so much attention and takes
up so much time cannot be ignored. In fact we have to be prepared

to accept the possibility that television should be regarded, along
with family, school, church, etc., as an important agent in the
development or socialization of the child. Additionally, in some
countries, most schools have the necessary facilities and equip¬
ment and, consequently, many children are also able to view (even
if what they watch is somewhat different) in the school as well as
in the home.
Although in western countries television is primarily seen as an
entertainment medium, it may also be used for educational purpo¬
ses. There are still those, although understandably not as many as
when the medium was first introduced, who speak in terms of the
medium's great potential for good. In fact, at times they appear to
regard it as a panacea for the social and educational ills of society.
However, when television figures prominently in the public
debate, it is generally its perceived potential for harm that receives
the attention, produces the concern and leads to public outcries,
the formation of pressure groups, the demands for censorship, the
setting up of special enquiries and commissions, and so on. In
many western countries television is accused of a wide variety of
offences, including the destruction of moral values, trivialization,
desensitization,' inhibiting creativity, forming an obstacle to educa¬
tion, wiping out hard-earned social and educational gains, fur¬
thering greed and unrealistic expectations and increasing crime
and violence.
The attack on television does not really represent a new pheno¬
menon; throughout history, technological innovations in commu¬
nication have been received with hostility. It is convenient for us to
be able to find a scapegoat, a single explanation for the ills of
society since this absolves us from examining our own possible
involvement in them. Admittedly, there are some who regard tele¬
vision as being entirely different in nature (and therefore in
influence) from print and sound media, but what people are saying
now about television has been said before by their forebears about
films, comics, magazines and the press.
It is worth noting that, until quite recently, in the developing
world the use of television was viewed with much more optimism,
with regard to its potential for development, than it has been in L
most western countries. Even now, the complaints in the develo- '

how the media experience fits in with other experiences and infor¬
mation are all influenced by other factors. These include the stage
of development of the child, role of parents, availability of other
relevant information, alternative sources and perceived substitu¬
tes, attitudes of peers, need for expression, search for meaning,
and so on.
Parents from different social classes control the viewing of pre¬
school children in different ways (some, not at all). Young delin¬
quents talk far less about what they see on television, not only to
parents, but also to teachers and friends, than do non-delinquents
from similar backgrounds; success at school, the degree of com¬
mitment to school values and the meaningfulness of the school
experience influence the degree to which young people become
involved in various aspects of pop culture; university students and
the police interpret the portrayal of political demonstrations on
television in quite different ways (individuals from both groups
actually "seeing" things which didn't actually happen); those with
personal experiences of living or working with ethnic minorities
make different use of the media treatment of race-related material.
There are some social scientists in the United States, however,
who would not equate television viewing with experiences with
other media, still less with non-media experiences. To them, the
ping countries about the medium's performance and shortcomings
are not unconnected with western influence, and in particular with
the import of western programmes.
Unfortunately, the debate about the influence of television, and
the media generally, tends to be conducted at a rather low level.
Quite simply, this is because the right questions are rarely asked.
This is not surprising, for those who ask the questions and make
the statements (including many who would claim to be social
scientists) work within the boundaries of inadequate models (rarely
explicitly articulated) of both society and the communication
process.
Questions and statements about "the effects of television on
children", "television as a cause of some form of behaviour", etc.,
whether made from a positive or negative standpoint about media
influence, place the medium firmly in the middle of the stage. From
the outset the medium is central in the explanatory process of
whatever attitude or behaviour is being examined.
Yet the use of a more appropriate model and the utilization of
more refined knowledge about the behaviour in question would
invariably suggest a different approach. Television would be
placed in context, where due attention would be given to media
other than television, and to other institutions (e.g. family, school)
that might be expected to have contributed to the development of
the specific behaviour and played a part in the general socialization
of the child.
Television is a force, in some cases it may be an important force,
to be reckoned with. But usually it is only one force amongst sev¬
eral forces, which interact in a complex manner in the develop¬
ment of the child.
To emphasize these points, however, is not to deny that tele¬
vision has influence. On the contrary; children may identify with
television models, they may imitate what they see on the screen,
and obviously they may learn from television, directly and in¬
directly, at several levels, just as they learn from other sources.
But television rarely, if ever, operates in isolation. Most western
societies are not homogeneous. They are differentiated or strati¬
fied in some way or other. Children, in addition to basic differences
in their make-up, come from a wide range of backgrounds, where
they have met different people, had different experiences and
opportunities, and so on. When they watch television they do so
with their own special filtering equipment, which in general terms
may be seen as a mesh of past experiences, present relationships
and affiliations, and future expectations. It is, then, not so much a
question of what television does to children as what children do
with the material that television, portrays.
Research suggests that, although we have mass media, it might
be misleading to talk about mass communication ("a contradiction
in terms in a heterogeneous society"). It is misleading to refer to
children as such, and to television as such.
Children differ in so many ways. What children actually watch
on television, how they attend to it, what they perceive, how they
interpret the experience, what they remember, what they recall.

electronic medium as it currently operates in the USA, is qualita¬
tively, in fact totally, different from other media and other sources
of information and experience. They see television as the cultural
arm of society, disseminating cultural symbols into the public
consciousness and producing a cultural homogeneity far more per¬
vasive than researchers in other countries, as well as other resear¬
chers in their own country, have been able to detect.
The extensive portrayal of violence on television is seen not so
much as a source of imitation or stimulus to aggression but as
creating fear, apprehension and insecurity which may then be
translated into a firm, possibly an excessive, support for the forces
of law and order, and may even lead eventually to submission and
subservience to the State.
This argument, although many would question its validity, is
another, more up to date and more complex version of the oft sta¬
ted general case that, on the whole in western society, the media
operate in the interests of the establishment and tend to serve the
system by legitimating, maintaining and reinforcing the status quo.
In passing, we might note that in non-western societies the media
may perform the same basic function, albeit in a different, more
direct and deliberate manner. Everywhere the medium is the
system, and the medium is an agent in the socialization of the
child.
It is important, however, to emphasize that there is much more
to the influence of television and to an understanding of its role in
child development than can possibly be ascertained by the use of
the conventional, and perhaps misleading, research approaches
which focus on imitation, modelling, identification, attitude
change, and so on.
But to question the validity of this research is certainly not to
deny the influence of television. On the contrary, it is to demon¬
strate the complexity and subtlety of a process which could be far
more pervasive and influential than many would believe possible.
Basically it has more to do with frameworks of interpretation than
discrete messages and direct effects.
For example, children are almost bound to be influenced in some
way or other by the basic values which underlie so much of what
television provides. In most western societies television, particu¬
larly when associated with advertising in emphasizing "planned
obsolescence", "constructive discontent" or "the ostentatious
display of conspicuous consumption" gives the message loud and
clear, and the message is that material prosperity is what matters.
The medium becomes the menu
when the TV set dominates the
dining table like an electronic guest.
Television can play a valuable role in
the young child's life, providing
information, sparking ideas and
dramatizing human feelings. But
addictive TV watching may be a
mechanism for avoiding discussion of
family problems and for eliminating
the rituals and pastimes of family
life. Left, sketches by two nine-year-
old French children who were asked to

School and community television in India
In August 1975 India launched a unique, year-long experiment in
TV satellite communication in order to speed the growth of
knowledge In its rural areas. During this Satellite Instructional
Television Experiment (SITE) programmes were beamed via the
U.S. ATS-6 satellite to community TV receivers In some 2,400
villages. Below, rooftop antenna In the village of Pilikltilai near
Jaipur. Children were the main beneficiaries of SITE, and
according to one report the experiment generated so much
interest in learning that there was a fall in the number of school
drop-outs. Right, educational TV broadcast in a Pilikltilai school.
As part of the experiment Unesco helped train programme
producers, who often work in consultation with psychologists,
educators and social workers. When SITE ended in 1976 the
experiment was continued with ground transmitters which
brought to rural areas, especially in the Ahmadabad region,
programmes on such themes as farming, nutrition and hygiene.
Above, adult viewers watch an evening broadcast on the
community TV set In a village square. Educational TV in India is
broadcast in many languages Including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil,
Marathi, Gujerati, Urdu and English. It seeks active participation
from children In a variety of entertaining programmes which
present music, dance, drama, games, quiz shows, and offer
training In handicrafts. Care is taken to respect cultural values
and traditions, and the content of advertising Is governed by a
special code. India, which already has a million TV receivers, is
planning to launch its own satellite, INSAT, in 1982, to bring the
benefits of educational television to an even wider area of the
country.

(. Material prosperity is undoubtedly the predominant value in
western society a value which is daily promoted by the media.
The media pay great attention to the goals and objectives but they
have little to say about the legitimate ways of achieving the
advocated goals, and there is no doubt that there are many people
in most countries who do not have the chance to achieve them
legitimately.
By operating in this way television may help in the development
of unrealistic expectations, make some people aware of their rela¬
tive deprivation and lead to frustration, and possibly aggression or
deviance. When television programmes with such values are
exported to developing countries, the position becomes even more
problematic.
The points just made may not appear compatible with the earlier
comments about individual selectivity with regard to perception,
interpretation, reaction, etc. In this connexion it should first be
stressed that when it is said that different children make different
use of the media, we are not thinking in terms of a sort of indivi
dual anarchy. Children may be grouped together, and groups
which have several relevant factors in common (e.g. age, sex,
social class, education) may be found to use the media in similar
ways.
Secondly, and more importantly, the children's selections are
not unlimited. They are restricted by what is provided by televi¬
sion. Television sets the agenda, and to that degree controls the
discourse, usually in a relatively consistent, conformist manner.
Children select from television and the other media in an attempt
to give meaning to their lives, and these selections will reflect their
non-media experiences and general situations.
This is how television becomes an agent in the socialization
process a process which may involve coming to terms, or other¬
wise dealing with, several sets of values (although one might be
predominant) rather than simply conforming (or not conforming)
to just one.
In the same way, it can be misleading to talk about television per
se. Some research indicates that increasingly, over the years, tele
vision has come to be regarded as the most used and the most
reliable source of information. But it is interesting to note that
when questions are asked in research which deal with the different
matters covered bv television (e.g. music, morals, politics, sport,
fashion, etc.) then the use, perceived credibility and influence of
television, vis-à-vis other sources, vary according to the subject.
Moreover, television varies from country to country, not only in
terms of output, but also in terms of its relationship to other insti¬
tutions. More than simply an electronic medium, television is,
above all, a social-political institution and its policy, modus ope¬
randi and output have to be seen within the appropriate social-
political frameworks which it will reflect and reinforce.
If we are looking at the relationship between television and chil¬
dren, then the overall picture will be different in those countries
where communication policies and education policies are clearly
articulated and closely related from what it will be in those coun¬
tries where there is no planned relationship between the two, and
where the forces of the market-place might predominate, at least
as far as television policy and programmes are concerned.
In one case there is a conscious attempt to use both the media
and the educational system as part of a deliberate policy to meet
needs which have been defined from some value position. In the
other, it seems to be assumed (although the problem is rarely
couched in this way) that needs (ill-defined) will be best met
through the free play of market forces. Both approaches (and
there are differences within each) have advantages and disadvan¬
tages. It is the latter system, or some version of it, that holds sway
in most western societies. Not surprisingly, it is often characterized
by internal contradictions with regard to values, policy and prac¬
tice, not only between television and education, but also between
different departments (e.g. education, entertainment, advertising)
within the same broadcasting institution.
We need to remember that, although some broadcasting institu¬
tions provide excellent educational programmes for children and
young people, these programmes are but a drop in the ocean of
total output, and frequently represent values which do not appear
consistent with those of general output.
The fact that there are different policies with regard to education
and television in different countries means, quite obviously, that
alternative approaches are available for consideration in any given
country. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the relevant
social systems, the debate is often polarized into a not very fruitful
confrontation between "freedom" and "central control".
There must be something to learn from all systems. Perhaps we
could start by questioning the elitist or top-downwards approach
to broadcasting which seems to prevail in all countries, irrespective
of political climate. We know it is not necessary that television
should always take the form of the few talking to the many often
about the position of the many from the standpoint of the
few but it usually does take this form.
We might begin to look for alternative forms. Decisions about
media policy are governed by considerations of ideology, political
expediency, private profit and the need to maintain existing struc¬
tures, although needless to say these are usually rationalized in
terms of the public good, or the communication needs of society.
Perhaps one of our main tasks in this year of the child should be
to cut through these tautologies, test the various claims and try to
ascertain precisely what specific needs of children are being met,
to what degree and with what consequences, by different broad¬
casting systems in different parts of the world. We might then be
in a position, by drawing on experiences from many countries, to
make recommendations about the structures and policies most
likely to meet basic needs and, it is to be hoped, to take the appro¬
priate action.
Such an approach to communication, particularly if linked to
systematic attempts to educate children in media understanding
and appreciation, might also help to foster international under¬
standing, the prime aim of Unesco's policy.

Mass media
the new
Pied Piper
by Kazuhiko Goto
Asociety is defined as an "informa¬
tion-oriented" society when it
places more weight on knowledge
and information than on things; and the
fact that Japan is on the verge of the era of
the information-oriented society has been a
matter of discussion in Japan for some
time.
In fact, what we really mean when we
speak of the information-oriented society is
the "mass media information-oriented"
society, with all the profound effects on
children that this implies. For in addition to
the world of nature and of other people, .
children are now surrounded by an artificial
environment created by the mass media.
Japan is certainly one of the most
television-oriented societies in the world.
Indeed, in Japan it would probably be
easier to track down a missing person than
to find a child who does not watch tele¬
vision.
It is easy to see why television is such an
attractive medium to both children and
adults. It is available in the home and we
can watch it in comfort whenever we
please, it provides easily digested entertain¬
ment after a day's work, it enables us to
see places and people and their way of life
that we would otherwise be unable to see
directly, and it is accessible even to viewers
with little education or knowledge.
Unfortunately, television takes up our
time; to watch it we must sit in front of it,
watch as long as a programme lasts, and
do nothing else while watching it. This
exclusive aspect of television, the fact that
it prevents us from doing other things,
poses more serious problems than is com¬
monly realized. While television may pro¬
vide an acceptable form of relaxation for
adults after a day's work, it robs children
of the time they must have to accumulate a
variety of experiences at first hand.
However, not everything that television
offers us is desirable. Even when well-
intentioned programmes suitable for chil¬
dren are provided, there is no guarantee
that these are the only programmes chil¬
dren will watch. In fact, as matters stand
now, children watch more programmes
intended for adults than programmes spe¬
cifically designed for children.
One likely outcome of this will be the eli¬
mination of the boundary between the sub¬
culture of the adult and the child. Children
may come into contact with the adult world
too soon, while they are at their most vul¬
nerable. Unless the adults in the home fulfil

the role of interpreter and mediator, the
children will absorb the view of society,
and of adult roles in it, depicted on the
screen, rather than the spontaneous, natu¬
ral view they would otherwise have ob¬
tained from the experiences of daily life.
Furthermore, the models of society, of
the roles and occupations of men and
women in it, that children will learn will be
simplified models adapted to meet the pro¬
gramme producer's need to provide enter¬
tainment. Inevitably the adult sub-culture
of the future will be affected.
An important but often overlooked fea¬
ture of television is that the images and
sound it provides, though similar to reality,
lack the dimension of interaction and res¬
ponse that we experience in direct contact
with the real world and offer only one-way
communication. For the child, the parent's
response and his interaction with the other
children and adults around him are crucial
to his comprehension of the world and his
insertion into society. The tendency of
busy, working parents to use television as a
surrogate nurse to occupy the children and
to keep them quiet has the effect of depri¬
ving them of a factor vital to their proper
development.
This passive role of the child viewer takes
on an additional significance in countries
where broadcasting is financed, whether
wholly or in part, by income earned from
advertising.
Television commercials are exceptionally
attractive to children. An advertisement is
always "good* news". Repeated, slickly
produced commercials for attractively dis¬
played goods stress the virtues of the pro¬
ducts concerned but never mention their
weak points. Children are given the illusion
that there is an infinite supply of new
goods and services available to all and
there is no countervailing incentive for
them to control their desire to buy. There is
no attempt to teach them to be discrimina¬
ting consumers. On the contrary, their
desire is aroused for essentially unneces¬
sary consumer items, for tempting sweets
and snacks and processed foods.
Great though the impact of television
commercials is on children, it may well be
surpassed by that of the slot-machines to
be found in the amusement centres or
"games corners" that have sprung up all
over Japan. Often the haunt of gangs of
juvenile delinquents, these centres even
have slot-machines that feature the killing
of men. Unlike television programmes
which, however bad they may be, even¬
tually come to an end, slot-machines are
available for play for just as long as the
player's supply of coins lasts.
Even if a child resists the temptations of
the street corner amusement centre, he is
liable to succumb to the attractions of the »

. zines that are available not only from
bookstores, kiosks and news-stands but at
drug-stores and supermarkets as well.
Most of these are comics containing serial¬
ized stories so that once a child begins to
read one he wants to read subsequent
issues as well. Most of those who fear the
effects of these magazines on children con¬
centrate their criticisms on the vulgarity,
the violence and the sexual explicitness of
their contents. In this respect their effect
on children can be compared to that of
television programmes of similar content.
More important, perhaps, is their effect
on reading habits. This type of magazine
has been on the market now for several
years and many of those who first read
them as children continue to read them
now that they are adults. It is probably true
to say that the increase in the number of
children and adults who do not read con¬
ventional books is directly related to the
spread of comics and of television.
Television, slot-machines, comics is
there a common link between them? As
machines or the product of machines and
deriving from industrial activity, they form
part of the modern mechanical-electronic
environment which tends to diminish or
exclude direct, personal communication
between people and to arouse and distort
human desires and expectations.
If the present trend for both mother and
father to work and to be absent from the
home all day continues, our children will
find themselves more and more the cap¬
tives of this artificial, indirect, inhuman
environment.

Cinema and TV bring entertainment to
millions of children by creating a world of
adventure and fantasy. But with
youngsters there is a real danger that
over-exposure to fictional films and
programmes may induce them to blur the
distinction between reality and make-
believe and even that the simulated world
brought to them by the media may
become more real than life itself.

COMPARED with their importance in
everyday life, children are under-
represented on the cinema screen.
There are, of course, films with children in
them, but few films actually about children.
The reason is simple: there are no child
stars today. And since the star system
forms the commercial basis of the cinema,
children can only be used in films as sub¬
sidiary characters, extraneous or marginal
to the main course of the action, decorative
frills to the plot.
And yet in the old days Hollywood had
its child-stars whose adventures the public
loved to follow from film to film. But to my
mind these productions, though often
highly entertaining and of excellent quality, i
were not of a nature to enrich our under- 1
FRANÇOIS TRUFFAUT, the French film direc¬

turn shop storeman, office clerk and welder. A
cinema-lover from an early age, he became film
critic of the magazines Cahiers du Cinéma and
Arts before working as an assistant to Roberto
Rossellini. In 1959, his first feature-length film.
Les Quatre Cents Coups (The 400 Blows), won
the prize for best direction at the Cannes Festi¬

by François Truffaut
François Truffaut's film L'Enfant Sauvage (1969) is based on the true
story of a boy found living wild and abandoned in a forest of southern
France In 1798. The child was taken to the Institute for the Deaf and
Dumb in Paris, where he was cared for by a doctor, Jean Itard, who set
out to educate him, inventing certain methods which are still used
today in the education of the deaf and dumb. In the film the role of
Itard was played by Truffaut himself, who relied heavily on the doctor's
account of the case when preparing the scenario. Below, the "wild
child" shortly after being captured by hunters. In a later scene, bottom

many to bp ineducable, his intelligence has been awakened by Itard's
devoted tutoring.

Standing of children and may even have
* given film-goers a false idea of childhood.
They usually travestied the truth, ramming
a diet of optimism down the throat of a
mainly youthful public.
Some film scenarios play false to chil¬
dren, who are cheated out of their due by
something or other, an animal, say, or an
object, which is considered intrinsically
poetic. Since children automatically bring
poetry with them wherever they appear, I
feel that film-makers should not delibera¬
tely introduce a poetic note into films about
children. The poetry should emerge spon¬
taneously; it should not be a means to an
end nor should it be an end in itself.
Let me give a concrete example of what I
mean. I find more poetry in a sequence
showing a child wiping the dishes than in
one showing the same child in velveteen
picking flowers in a garden to a soundtrack
of music by Mozart.
It should never be forgotten that the
about children can be made from seem¬
ingly insignificant events, for the truth of
the matter is that nothing to do with
childhood is insignificant.
The adult cinema-goer sees childhood as
linked to the idea of innocence and above
all to the idea of purity; an adult who be¬
comes emotional when he sees a child on
the screen is actually indulging in self-pity
and mourning his own lost "innocence".
So it is essential to be realistic : and what is
realism but a refusal to peddle either pessi¬
mism or optimism. Let the viewer make up
his own mind without taking his cue from
the director!
In my opinion the most fascinating age,
and the one which offers the most cinema¬
tographic possibilities, is that between
eight and fifteen, the age of awakening
consciousness.
For parents, everything before adoles¬
cence, and even the word adolescent itself,
is of little significance. For mum and dad
public expect children to play on their
heartstrings. Consequently, it is difficult to
avoid coyness when making a film about
children. The only solution is a deliberate,
calculated hardening of the heart when
deciding on how to treat the subject; this
does not mean that the film will lose any of
its impact.
A child smiles on the screen, and lo and
behold you've got the audience in your
pocket. But in real life the most striking
thing is that children are serious when
adults are futile. This is why I believe that a
higher level of truth can be achieved by
filming not only children's games but also
their dramas which are huge and have
nothing to do with adult conflicts.
The adult world as seen by children is
one where nothing is punished; anything
goes. A father laughs as he tells his friends
how he smashed his car against a tree; but
if his eight-year-old son accidentally drops
a bottle while trying to help out at home he
will think he has committed a crime, for
a child makes no distinction between an
accident and a misdemeanour.
An incident of this kind can produce a
dramatic situation on the screen: a film
Los Olvidados (The
Young and Damned)
directed by Luis Bunuel
(Mexico, 1949).
you are a child until you do your military
service, which makes a man of you... or so
they seem to think.
And yet adolescence brings with it the
discovery of injustice and the desire for
independence. The adolescent's affections
are weaned away from his or her parents ;
sexual curiosity begins to stir. Adolescence
is a hyper-critical age which sees the first
conflicts between the absolute morality of
childhood and the relative morality of adult¬
hood, between purity of heart and the
impurity of life. In a word, it is the most
interesting age for any artist to spotlight.
I know that most people take a poor view
of those who get children to act on stage or
screen. For myself, I reject out of hand the
view that children's personalities suffer
serious damage when they become actors.
This is far from the truth. And in France at
least the employment of child actors is
today strictly controlled by law. A commit¬
tee goes through the scenario with a tooth-
comb; the child is medically examined; the
head teacher of his or her school is consul¬
ted; the case is submitted to the local
authorities. The parents receive only
twenty per cent of the fee, the remainder

(USA, 1921).
being put in a savings bank account for the
child. If the film is shot during term-time, a
teacher must supervise the child's educa¬
tion.
Adolescent actors contribute to a film an
extraordinary purity of which professionals
are not always capable. If something in the
action or dialogue is ridiculous they sense it
immediately and make no bones about
saying so. The director must be sufficiently
modest and flexible to make use of their
frankness and realism and modify various
details of his film accordingly, adapting the
character to the young actor rather than
artificially forcing the young actor to fit in
with the character. A children's film must
be made with the collaboration of the chil¬
dren themselves, for they have an infallible
nose for truth in natural, uncontrived situa¬
tions. In a classroom scene, for example,
they know that the sound of pens scraping
in inkwells is all-important.
Unlike professional actors children have
no technical gimmicks; they do not try to
hog the camera; they do not know whether
they have one profile better than another;
they are always honest where feelings are
concerned. This may seem curious, but
everything a child does on the screen he
seems to be doing for the first time.
Film which records the transformation of
young faces is doubly precious because of
the tension between each action and its
wider symbolic significance.
This is why, for twenty years now, I have
never wearied of making films with children
and why I shall make more films about
them in the years to come.

African childhood
by Cámara Laye
CÁMARA LAYE, Guiñean writer, attended the
Koranic school and, later, the French primary
school at Kouroussa, northern Guinea. Coming
to France, he continued his studies in Paris
while, at the same time, working in a factory.
When Guinea achieved independence, in 1958,
he returned to his country where he assumed
important administrative functions. Since 1965,
he has lived in Senegal. He is the author of
L'Enfant Noir (The Black Child), published by
Plön, Paris, in 1953, in which he recounts his
African childhood, and of two novels. Le Regard
du Roi (The King's Regard), Plön, 1954, and
Dramouss, Plön, 1966.
KOUROUSSA in Guinea, West Africa,
my birthplace and the traditional
home of my forebears, is a typical
Malinke village; the Djeliba River which
flows past it dominates the life of its mainly
agricultural population. Kouroussa is situ¬
ated some seven hundred kilometres from
the coast and is reached by train or auto¬
mobile.
In my childhood, Kouroussa was a clus¬
ter of round banco (clay-walled) huts top¬
ped by conical, thatched roofs. The village
housed various kapila, or extended fami¬
lies, bound together by a love that welded
them into united, close-knit groups.
From my studies of the oral tradition of
West Africa, undertaken over the past
twenty years, I know today that Tabon
Wana Fran Cámara was an ancestor of
mine. He was a contemporary of Tira Mag¬
han Traore, the great general of Manden,
of Do Samo Conde, king of Sosso, of
Fakoli Koroma, leader of the Koromas, of
Famandjan, king of Sibi, of Sundiata Keita,

> emperor of Mali in the thirteenth century.
The original Mandingo were a people
formed of a confederation of the differ¬
ent tribes which constituted the basis of
the Malian empire.
According to our elders, the snake spirit
of our race belonged first to Fran Cámara
and /Tjade hinj^a^skilled and respected
.craftsman. "As à child iwas taken by my,
father to see the snake spirit whom I got to;
1<now very well. The source of my father's
skill in the shaping of wood and the work¬
ing of metal, the snake spirit was also his
trusted adviser in the art of controlling his
colleagues.
In those days men protected themselves
with all manner of greegrees (charms); it
was a time of revealers of things hidden,
and of healers, some of whom really could
heal.
A child in Kouroussa did not belong to
his parents but to his lineage group which
was responsible for him and took care of
his education. The individual remained link
ed to the group which was held to have
given him life, and it was within the group
that he continued to live.
This solidarity, or rather this source of
life, made itself felt on important occa¬
sions. Every birth was attended by the
whole village. As soon. as the cries of the
woman in labour "Were heard, all the, old
women pushed itp.jhêr aid, whlle^trje/elders
gathered in thefshade;of the great bombax
tree, in the'centre of the village and
anxiously awaited the announcement of
the birth. When the infant arrived, the
father made the rounds to thank the
villagers, for the child had been born
thanks to the efforts of all. Throughout the
day, all the villagers in turn visited the
woman in childbed to thank her for having
given them a baby.
Should a villager fall ill, the men and
women would visit the sufferer on the way
to work in the fields in the morning and
again on their return in the evening. But it
was above all at the time of a death that the

solidarity of Kouroussa was seen at its
best. Work was abandoned so that
everyone could lavish attention on the one
who was dying and on his or her family.
Today, many of the ancient customs are
unsuited to the modern age and have had
to be abandoned. But the solidarity arising
from these exchanges created a current of
sympathy and was a positive aspect of tra,-.,
ditionalsociety. Solidarity was a vital force :
that existed in 'all African villages.
There were many customs like these
which astound our children when we speak
of them today and which will astound our
grandchildren even more. Many things
which were commonplace in Africa's past
were a source of astonishment to Euro¬
peans. Yet the Europe of long ago had its
own mysteries which, though different
from ours, could have helped to ensure
European acceptance of our mysteries.
Did all these things of which I have
written really exist? Why should this be
doubted? Is the world no more than what
a cursory glance around us reveals?
In the past, the face, the figure or the
animal that took shape from the wood in
our sculptors' hands and the varied output
of our sculptor-blacksmiths were imbued
with mystery and were designed for use in
worship and magic. It was a time when the
sculptor-blacksmith was not merely a
craftsman, but a sorcerer, a priest in cons¬
tant contact with fire, which he used first
to melt the ore and then to breathe shape
into the metal. It was a time when the hoe
was not merely a tool for turning the soil,
but an instrument which controlled the
earth and the harvest.
This was a time when the art of the
blacksmith ranked above all others. It was a
truly noble art which required more know¬
ledge and skill than any other. In our
society the smith was probably the first
specialized craftsman; the knowledge he
had to possess, the operations that had to
be gone through to transform the ore into a
weapon or an agricultural implement made
specialization essential.
Once his special skill was recognized, it
was natural for people to turn to the
blacksmith when they wanted something
carved in wood. Not, of course, for the
ordinary utensil that anyone could rough
out, but for likenesses of ancestors and for
the most ancient images of all totems and
the masks for ritual dances, indeed, all the
cult objects his skills enabled him to pro¬
duce. And though these skills have never
been completely lost, they have, inevitably,
become rarer in a society whose ancient
animism has been confronted with new
ideas.
This is not to say that mystery is no
more, but simply that it is to be found
elsewhere it has emigrated. I became
aware of this in 1956 when, on returning to
Africa for good, I visited a Malinke crafts¬
man in Kouroussa. I still recall my amaze-

ment and my efforts to guess what would
emerge from the shapeless block under the
sharp, precise blows of the chisel. Yet
there was no mystery; only the wonder of
the head of a doe emerging unexpectedly
from the wood. Suddenly, I knew exactly
what was coming into being. It was not a
very mysterious mystery. It was the answer
to a riddle I had asked myself. But what of
the craftsman? What was he seeking as he
carved and shaped the wood?
He was looking for his own reality; he
sought to be true, as true as a man can be.
He had produced the most beautiful of
heads, an idealized head that epitomized
every doe.
Today, African sculpture is on display in
the world's leading museums and, more
than African literature whether expressed
in English or in French, it reveals the
extraordinary power and sympathy rooted
in the African soul.
Although it has not yet found its defini¬
tive place in the history of art, the influence
of this African sculpture swept through the
art world with the force of a tidal wave.
Yesterday's painters, who are still the great
painters of today, were obsessed with the
new plastic forms this sculpture provided.
These were the forms they seized upon and
experimented with, for they lent them¬
selves to all sorts of new styles and com¬
binations.
The discovery of our sculpture did not,
however, endow them with any greater spi¬
rituality. When we look back over the past
sixty years and examine the styles of that
period and those of today, almost the only
difference we can detect is an increased
formalism, no better and no worse than
what had gone before.
When I attended the French primary
school at Kouroussa, in 1940 and 1941,
when classes were over for the day, I often
liked to visit a craftsman in his workshop
and watch him as he set to work carving a
piece of wood. It all seemed so strange to
me at the time and it has taken me years to
understand that, whereas in the West the
artist was considered to be a giant among
men, in Africa the artist, the d/e/i or griot,
the poet, the belentigui, or master of the
word, the noumou, or blacksmith, the
siakl, or goldsmith, were always held to be
people of lesser importance than the ordi¬
nary man. That is why they felt more inten¬
sely than other men the weight of their pre¬
sence in the world.
Thus, curiously, the sculptor of the past,
placed before reality, did not copy it, he
transformed it. And at times he transform¬
ed it so much that he introduced a measure
of abstraction. By this, of course, I do not
mean abstraction to the point of confusion,
but a non-systematic abstraction which
therefore is unrelated to what Europe cur¬
rently calls abstract painting or sculpture; I
mean an abstraction which remains rather
unusual in African art and which is more a

there is no break in the fabric of history," writes the Togolese sociologist F. N'Sougan
Agblemagnon, evoking the harmony of traditional ways of life In Africa. "The ancestors

form of expressionism stretched to its not
clearly perceived limit.
Bent over the block of wood he was
fashioning with his adze, the craftsman of
the past did not calculatedly set out to
transform reality; he allowed his heart to
express itself with greater spontaneity, and
this led first of all to transformations which
brought out and accentuated expression
and spirituality. This later entailed other
purely plastic transformations intended to
balance the early ones and to complete
them.
But, it may be asked, if these transform¬
ations were not gratuitous, were not simply
stylistic, how is it that they appear in all
their mastery in all African sculpture? Why
do these planes and volumes make us think
of variations on a given theme? Why is the
rhythm here more striking, infinitely more
so, than in any other sculpture?
Here we are reaching down into the pro¬
fundities of the African soul the feeling
for rhythm that enables us, untaught, to
play the tom-tom, that means that not one
of us, from Senegal to Zaire, can hear the
beat of a tom-tom without wanting to
dance, that makes us born musicians and
born dancers.
What was achieved by the artists of the
past in negro-African sculpture can be
attempted and achieved in African litera¬
ture, in both the French and English
idioms. When I write, I too am seeking the
frenzied rhythm of the African tom-tom.

Children's
books
in an
audio-visual
age
by Marc Soriano
As elusive a quarry as the butterfly? Among the flood of
children's books and periodicals being produced today, how
many communicate to children an awareness of humanitarian
values, of their own rights and the rights of others? This design
was. drawn by the Pakistani artist Aysha Aziz Khan for an
International Poster Competition on the Right to Education, held
as part of the 7th International Film Festival on Human Rights at
Strasbourg (France) in November 1978.
THE invention of printing and the large-scale production of
printed books sparked off one of the greatest revolutions
in communications since the invention of writing. The
creation of a mass audience through the spread of the printed
word forced writers, artists and thinkers to express their ideas as
clearly as possible and to aim for greater universality and greater
objectivity.
From the seventeenth to the eighteenth century the printed
word created a great pool of informed people, specializing in criti¬
cal reflection, who, by their contributions to literature, the arts and
the sciences, helped in a certain way to raise the level of awareness
of the masses. In Western Europe, the struggle for the rights of
man and democratization in general may be seen, as early as the
late eighteenth century, and everi more clearly at the beginning of
the nineteenth century, to have been linked with the spread of
literacy.
Nowhere has faith in the written word been expressed more
clearly that is to say, more naively than in children's literature.
Certainly in the nineteenth century, the period when children's lite¬
rature emerged in most West European countries as a specific lite¬
rary form, the idea gained ground very quickly that adults were not
particularly receptive to education, and that it was more worth¬
while writing for children, who we're more malleable.
MARC SORIANO is professor of modern French literature at the Univer¬
sity of Paris (VII) and of the methodology of the socialsciences at the Ecole
Pratique des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. He has specialized in
interdisciplinary research in the social sciences on the basis of special-
purpose types of literature, teaching with audio-visual media and the tea¬
ching of reading. He is the author of a number of books including: Les
Contes de Perrault, Culture Savante et Traditions Populaires, Gallimard,
1968, and Guide de la Littérature pour la Jeunesse, Flammarion, 1959. This
anide is taken from a longer study by Marc Soriano, Children's Books and
Human Rights, published in Unesco's education quarterly Prospects,
Volume VII, no. 2, 1977.
This ideological concern, coupled with a desire to exercise
effective influence, was the hallmark of all those who were to take
an interest in children's books. Publishers and writers all seemed to
be seeking an ideal text, a work of fiction appealing to parents as
well as to children, offering information as well as entertainment
and fostering an awareness of their country, their traditions, their
rights and their duties.
But this expectation of salvation through the printed word and
literacy was soon to be disappointed : although literacy made
headway and books came to occupy a place of importance, there
was no corresponding improvement in the recognition of human
rights. Another unexpected twist occurred with the introduction of
new means of expression and communication, the audio-visual
media, which, while presenting information more cheaply, seem to
encourage audience passivity, and actually to conflict with the
printed word, thus contributing to a certain decline in literacy.
In Western Europe, the production of children's books has
become concentrated in the hands of a limited number of publish¬
ers. A craft industry in the nineteenth century, it is now governed
essentially by the law of maximization of profit, the child's interests
being only one of many factors to be taken into consideration in
"market research" based largely on the exploitation of existing
tastes. The result ¡s a market inundated with mass-produced,
stereotyped products which concentrate on entertainment and
whose educational value is slight or questionable.
Pitted against the publishing giants are a number of smaller
companies, often inspired by advanced educational ideas or ideo¬
logical, political or religious considerations. Their products are
interesting, often of very high standard, but their appeal is limited
by the efforts which they require of the readers. In this sphere, as
in others, bad money drives out good. Formula-produced fiction
based entirely on suspense makes the public even more passive
and thus encourages it to turn to the audio-visual media, which, it

must be remembered, offer immediate gratification, whereas the
pleasures of reading require a long apprenticeship.
At the same time, intermediate forms of expression are develop¬
ing, half text and half picture, the comic-strip or photo-strip story.
As a result of this process which is going on under our eyes, the
very meaning of the word "book" is changing from the sense
which it has had for centuries into the sense it already has for mil¬
lions of children .and young people: a series of connected and

What, then, remains of the great expectations which our for¬
bears and even our parents' generation entertained of books and
literacy? Is it possible or reasonable, in this last quarter of the twen¬
tieth century, to expect books (or series of books) to inculcate
humanitarian values in children? Do such books already exist or
have they still to be written? What should be the target age group
or groups? Should they be "all-purpose" books, suitable for diffe¬
rent cultures and the different levels of development of the various
countries, or differentiated to meet different requirements? How
should they be distributed? Through a private, national or inter¬
national organization? Although these are very broad questions,
they are neither gratuitous nor abstract.
Perhaps the type of book which we describe no longer exists,
but it did exist once. At various times and in various countries,
works have been published which were very closely in keeping
with the needs of the children for whom they were intended and
gave them not only pleasure but also a clearer awareness of their
rights and those of others. Cuore by De Amicis, for example, has
perhaps dated, but in 1886 it gave an exceptionally warm-hearted
insight into socialist thinking. The same is true of Mark Twain's
Huckleberry Finn, which, even today, represents a worthwhile
attempt to escape from racist patterns of thinking.
But before we go any further, what is a children's book exactly?
A children's book is a message, a historical communication bet¬
ween an adult ¡ri a given society and its intended recipient a child
belonging to the same society and who, by definition to some
extent, has not yet acquired the knowledge, experience of life and
emotional maturity which are the signs of adulthood.
The importance of the historical context
î For communication to take p&pé,'yvhàt is needed -in. fact all
that ¡s'needédtofor the sender arid receiver of the message to
share a cómmon^code, and for iriîs obde to relate to the historical
context. It is therefore quite impossible to disregard real situations
which affect not only the speaker but also the hearer. This analysis
helps us to avoid the mistake of thinking that the problem is our
own invention.
In fact, the adult has always tried to establish communication
with the children of his society, even before the invention of
printing or indeed of writing, in order to pass on to them his under¬
standing of rights and duties. Before it took the forms with which
we are familiar, this message used other channels of communica¬
tion, for example the oral tradition, or dances and games.
In seeking to formulate a new message a book which really
accomplishes what it sets out to dowe have nothing to gain by
setting it in a limbo outside time and place, since the children for
whom it is intended will exist in a particular time and place. It
would, on the contrary, be helpful to situate it within a tradition, so
that it can draw upon that tradition and so that any new message it
contains may be more clearly distinguished against that familiar
background.
This rules out the illusory idea of a single book, effective in any k
country and at any period of time. The structure of our bodies and f

minds is doubtless universal, which means, in Sartre's fine phrase,
* that "tout homme me vaut"; but from birth onwards every indivi¬
dual has been continually worked on and altered by his personal
history and that of his country.
Every man is like every other man, but yet develops into an indi¬
vidual unlike any other, belonging to a group, large or small, with
its own specific needs. The battles have yet to be fought and won
for reason and consciousness to become universal.
We should not allow ourselves to be misled by the very complex
case of the "classics", which, in the last analysis, create their own
public. These works are usually firmly rooted in a local soil and, by
reason of their very specificity, make the young reader curious to
discover his own roots or to find new ones.
The type of book for which we are looking must emerge and
establish itself in the educational environment with which the child
is familiar. The best potential authors of this type of book should
be sought not in the artificial milieu of the "general without sol¬
diers" (educational theorists, all-purpose "experts" who always
find the right solution to fit any situation) but among the teachers,
research-workers and artists of each country who are the only peo¬
ple really familiar with their national traditions and aware of the
power of persuasion which they still wield.
Careful analysis of specific historical contexts teaches us not to
minimize or to exaggerate the influence of the printed word. Does
it indeed can itserve the cause of human rights as long as the
real power is in the hands of certain strata who do not stand to
gain if other men exercise their rights?
There ¡s a strong temptation for anti-democratic authorities to
use the audio-visual media not to give effective information and to
stimulate critical and political awareness, but to "depoliticize" pro¬
blems and to deny the existence of the social sciences, which
amounts to encouraging audience passivity and systematically
"disinforming" the public in order to maintain the status quo.
It is thus impossible to study the influence of books in isolation
from the historical situation in which they are produced and dis¬
tributed: reading habits, the structure of publishing houses and
libraries, educational legislation, actual school attendance rates,
the nature of production relationships, of the State, etc.
One should not, therefore, rely on books, nor even on literacy,
to inculcate in men an awareness of their rights, much less the will
to defend them. To attribute to books the almost exclusive power
to inculcate human rights is implicitly to endorse a number of erro¬
neous assumptions.
The first concerns the reading process itself. The fact that some
people can read does not necessarily mean that we know how one
learns to read. There are several levels of reading ability and pro¬
gress from one level to the next is achieved only by long practice.
To be able to read is not to be able to spell out letters of syllables
or to have mastered the skill of silent reading, or even to be able to
switch from one sense to another, picking out key works by rapid
and creative anticipation i.e. it is not only the ability to read
rapidly and "identify" with the reading-matter, but also and above
all the ability continually to vary one's pace and to adopt a critical
attitude to what is being read.
To place undue reliance on literacy and books, in our historical
context, is to forget that our system of education (due to the in¬
adequacies of our teaching methods and the forces working
against critical inquiry) turns out large numbers of non-readers or
poor readers; it is also to forget the crucial factor of the relapse
into illiteracy, what Albert Meister calls "l'ana/phabétisation de
retour" (the illiteracy backlash). This phenomenon does not only
occur in developing countries and countries which are economi¬
cally underdeveloped, where the mother tongue tends to conflict
with the official language required for "getting ahead". It is much
more general. We know more or less how to teach the skill of
reading, but not the pleasure of reading, which is why a good
third of the "school population", after spending ten years of its life
learning how to read, spends the rest of its life forgetting.
Unless the reading habit is made an integral part of the reader's
personality, it is not to be relied on as a means of spreading aware¬
ness of human rights, for this requires an active rather than a
passive attitude on the part of those concerned, whether children
or semi-literate adults.
Another mistaken assumption involved in undue reliance on
books is that human rights can then only be preached to those old
Lines
of
communication
"It would appear that the book is a successor to the
'transitional object'," writes Marc Soriano (see page 24).
The term "transitional object" is used by the British
paediatrician and psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott to
describe an object "that becomes vitally important to the
infant for use at the time of going to sleep, and is a
defence against anxiety". This object, which never
changes, exists in the intermediate territory between
"inner psychic reality" and the external world and "gives
room for the process of becoming able to accept
difference and similarity".
As the child grows up, the transitional object "fades
away" and the whole subject of transitional phenomena
becomes diffused and "widens out into that of play, and
of artistic creativity and appreciation, of religious feeling
and of dreaming, and also of fetishism, lying and
stealing, etc."
Winnicott, who died in 1971, attached great importance to
play which, he believed, could perform a major role in
psychiatric therapy. He liked to encourage the children
who were brought to him for consultation to play what he
called the "squiggle game" with him. "In this game," he
wrote, "I make some kind of impulsive line-drawing and
invite the child to turn it into something, and then he
makes a squiggle for me to turn into something in my
turn".
For Winnicott the squiggle game was a means of creating
a situation in which the child and the therapist became
aware of a critical problem with which the child was
grappling and which was preventing his development.
Reproduced on the opposite page are nine of sixteen
drawings executed during one of Winnicott's consultations
with an eight-year-old girl named Ruth. Ruth had two
sisters, one older and one younger than herself, and
united parents. She had been pampered as a small child,
and began to steal when her mother became pregnant for
the third time. Her mother had been ill several times.
Unknown to Ruth, Winnicott knew all this.
During the consultation Ruth soon began to feel at ease.
She talked about her sisters and agreed to play the
squiggle game. Winnicott drew a squiggle which she
immediately transformed into a baby carriage, her own
baby carriage which she had had for a year (1).
Next Winnicott turned a drawing by Ruth into a plant.
Then the girl drew her three dolls, described them to
Winnicott and told him their names. She said that she
would rather be a mother than a father and that she
would like to have as many children as possible. In this
way she gave the doctor an image of her own family.
Ruth turned Winnicott's next squiggle into "a person" (2).
Then the girl drew another squiggle. When she had
finished it, she suddenly said "Oh! I know!" and
transformed it herself into a bow and arrow (3).
Ruth made a butterfly out of another of Winnicott's
squiggles (4). Then she described how her garden had
been spoiled by a man who had built lavatories in it.
The game went on with Winnicott changing a. squiggle
by Ruth into an animal which she said looked like
a giraffe (5).

When Winnicott drew his next squiggle, Ruth's immediate
response was to transform it into a harp (6) and to talk
about record-players and music. A record-player was put
on a shelf beside her but she did not want to use it.
Drawing 7: a squiggle by Ruth which the doctor turned
into a dancer.
After two more sketches, Winnicott noted that a feeling
of confidence had been established which might lead to a
desire to reach a deeper level. He asked Ruth to talk
about her dreams. "My dreams are almost always the
same," said the child. "I dream every night." Then she did
a big drawing of a dream. In it Ruth, very small, can be
seen running towards her mother (8). Although the
drawing does not "say" anything about the birth of the
third child, when Ruth described her dream she talked
about this baby and how it was fed. In the drawing, the
mother's hands are inactive, one of her legs is deformed,
and she seems to be smiling.
At the end of her mother's pregnancy Ruth had begun to
steal either baby food or money with which to buy it.
After Ruth had drawn this optimistic version of her dream,
Winnicott wanted to elicit a pessimistic version of it. This
time Ruth drew herself very small and very distant from
her mother (9). She said that there was poison in the sea
behind her. This image communicated to Winnicott an
mmediate impression of separation and despair. While
Ruth was drawing, she felt that she was getting further
and further away from her mother. The drawing she did of
herself, he added, was perfectly straight from the
shoulders down. The downturned lines of her mouth were
continued by the arms and became part of a bag which
contained no food for the baby. She said that this was
why she had had to stuff herself with food. "When there
was no more poison, I got fat again".
Winnicott then asked Ruth whether she had ever stolen
anything, to which she replied that she had stolen baby
food and eaten it.
Winnicott stressed the importance of getting this
information from Ruth herself. Eight-year-old Ruth had
thus proved capable of recalling, reliving and illustrating
the distress she had felt at a moment of deprivation, when
she had lost all hope of facing up to her mother's
pregnancy and the birth of her little sister. For her this
was a therapeutic experience and the subsequent changes
in her behaviour benefitted her family as a whole.

enough to learn to read, or, in the case of illiterate adults, those
' who are able to understand a code and a system of explanation
based on reasoning.
In fact contemporary psychology and psychoanalysis tell us that
the individual's basic options (attitude to the opposite sex, be¬
haviour patterns connected with "race" and with "difference" in
general) are determined before the age of 5 or 6, which is consider¬
ed to be the normal age for learning to read.
Psychopathology also reveals that the majority of behavioural
disturbances and of the main "neuroses" are formed during the
"Oedipus complex" stage, which is to say between 2 1 12 and 5
years, or even earlier, during the "oral" phase.
It is as if, out of respect for the printed word, which, historically,
is only one of several systems of communication, we were allow¬
ing such major diseases of civilization as racism and anti-feminism
to get a good hold before turning to books and to reasonto
combat them. Prevention, however, is always easier than cure.
Dead ends, wrong targets, right approaches
It would be extremely useful to build up a file on early childhood
and the pre-reading age based on study of the interests and mental
make-up characteristic of these early stages of development,
including, for example the development of what the English paedia¬
trician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott refers to as the "tran¬
sitional object", a blanket or item of clothing impregnated with the
mother's smell which the very young child uses for the "ritual" of
going to sleep, since it would appear, from the present state of our
knowledge, that the book is a successor to this "object".
It would be an unforgivable mistake to limit the inculcation of
"humanistic" values to age-groups which can read fluently and to
books proper, as the main prejudices and ideological afflictions of
humanity (racism, anti-feminism, war-mongering, passivity, dis¬
regard of the rights of others) have had time to become firmly root¬
ed in the conscious and, even more important, in the unconscious
of the 8- to 12-year-old child.
The real battle must be fought with children under the age of 6,
and must be waged with the spoken word, games, pictures and
mime, the written message being used only to consolidate what
has already been assimilated. ;
This calls into question the traditional concept of authorship,
which is already in practice undergoing some changes; in some
branches of children's literature, particularly the production of
encyclopaedias, but also fiction based on contemporary problems,
the author is replaced by a team in which one person is responsible
for "ideas", another for dialogue, another for illustrations, another
for layout, etc., these individuals sometimes being chosen for their
particular skills, but more often at random or simply for reasons of
cost.
The author should be reinstated as the person responsible for
ideas (or the lack of them) and at the same time supported by a
team which should include as a matter of course the "customers"
and educational experts, i.e. children or teachers.

"The child who is physically (or) mentally...
handicapped shall be given the special treatment,
education and care required by his particular
condition", states the fifth article of the Declaration
of the Rights of the Child proclaimed by the United
Nations. This principle has inspired a children's
book. The Boy with Two Eyes, a slightly condensed
version of which is reproduced on this double page
with some of the illustrations (in colour ¡n the
original). The book forms part of a series of ten,
each volume illustrating one of the ten articles of
the Declaration. The series, first published in
Spanish, has now appeared in eleven other language
editions: English, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French,
German, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese
and Welsh. The books were designed and originally
produced by the Madrid publishing house Altea. The
Spanish text of The Boy with Two Eyes is by J.L.
Garcia Sanchez and M.A. Pacheco; the illustrations
are by Ulises Wensell. The English edition of the
series is published by Basil Blackwell, Oxford, U.K.
Way out in space there is a planet just like Earth. The people who
live there are just like usexcept for one thingthey have only
one eye. But with their one eye they can see far, far away. They
can see straight through walls. One day a strange child was born.
He had two eyes! His mother and father were very upset.

did not see In black and white as everyone else

thrilling discovery. He told them wonderful
stories. He used words they had never heard
before... like red... and yellow... and orange.
The boy was a happy child. His parents loved him and enjoyed
looking after him but they were worried because he was so
unusual. They took him to lots of doctors. The doctors shook
their heads and said "Nothing can be done".
As the child grew up he had more and more problems. When he
went to school he could not read as well as other children. His
teachers had to give him extra help. He couldn't see long
distances so he had to have a special telescope.

and the International Year of the Child
UNESCO's activities in connexion
with the International Year of the
Child (1979), proclaimed by the
General Assembly of the United
Nations, form part of a continuing effort on
behalf of the world's children which began
when Unesco was created over thirty years
ago and faced the urgent task of helping
children whose lives and education had
been tragically disrupted by war.
Ever since then, Unesco has sought,
through its work in education, the social
sciences, culture and communication, to
strengthen global and national commit¬
ment to the welfare of children and to pro¬
mote action designed to bring about lasting
improvements in their lives.
During the International Year of the
Child, Unesco is covering a very broad
spectrum of activities encompassing the
education of handicapped children; the pro¬
tection of the rights of children, with spe¬
cial attention to those of migrant work¬
ers and refugees; the promotion and deve
lopment of children's books and libraries;
the encouragement of international support
for action programmes in favour of children
in developing countries; studies on such
questions as the impact of educational tele¬
vision on young children and the ways in
which children form scientific and techno¬
logical concepts; the training of staff for
pre-school education.
To help attract the attention of the world
community to children and their needs, and
to make Unesco and its work better known
to a youthful audience, a range of publica¬
tions, films and radio and television pro¬
grammes have been produced.
A programme co-produced by Unesco
and French television (TF.1) brings to the
screen seven world leaders whose mess¬
ages on the theme of IYC are interwoven
with songs and dances by children's groups
from different parts of the globe. Already
broadcast in France, it is being adapted into
many different languages and is expected
to be shown in some forty or fifty countries.
As part of an international film exchange
project co-ordinated by Unesco, TV net¬
works In ten countries are exploring child¬
hood in different social and cultural envi¬
ronments. Each network has agreed to pro¬
duce a film on the theme "the child and his
world" and to exchange a copy freely with
the others, so that all participating coun¬
tries will benefit from the complete series.
Unesco is also preparing a series of radio
programmes on children's rights, while a
number of short cartoon films for children
on "Discovering Unesco" are being made in
co-operation with Channel 3 of French tele¬
vision. Unesco will shortly be publishing a
study, based on recent research, of the
effects of educational television on chil¬
dren.
New Unesco publications specially writ¬
ten for young readers include A World for
Everybody, a booklet for children up to nine
years old which describes Unesco's aims
and action in simple, informal terms, and a
braille book with pictures in relief explai¬
ning Unesco to blind children.
A travelling exhibition of children's toys
and games from all over the world, already
held at Unesco's Paris headquarters, will be
on show in a joint Unicef-Unesco pavilion at
the "Man and his World" Exhibition at Mon¬
treal, Canada, between June and Septem¬
ber, while an international exhibition of
children's books is scheduled to take place
In Paris in April.
Young people from eighty-five countries
are taking part in a drawing competition
sponsored by National Commissions for
Unesco or national press or radio and televi¬
sion organizations. The entries, on the
thema "My life in the year 2000", will be
judged by an international jury at Unesco
headquarters on 15 May.
Finally, the illustrations on these pages
bear witness to another Unesco initiative
for IYC. They are taken from a forthcoming
catalogue of reproductions of paintings
depicting children, a publication inspired by
the popularity, over the years, of Unesco's
two-volume guide to reproductions of
major works of art.

The distorting influence of race prejudice on the
presentation of facts in school textbooks is a
disturbing phenomenon and one which is more
widespread than is generally believed. The problem
is not new and scarcely a country in the world can
claim to have eliminated it entirely. In its efforts to
promote international understanding and respect for
human rights, Unesco is closely concerned with this
situation and its corrosive effects on children's
minds. Thus, some time ago, Unesco sponsored a
proj'ect in which specialists from France, the Federal
Republic of Germany, India, Japan, Kenya, the
United Kingdom and Venezuela reviewed secondary
school history, geography and social studies
textbooks from each of these seven countries. A
report of their work was later published as
Promoting International Understanding through
School Textbooks. As part of its current programme
Unesco, in co-operation with its Member States, is
intensifying efforts to improve the content of
textbooks at all levels of education. Aspects of this
problem have been discussed in recent issues of the1
Unesco Courier in articles by Renée Miot on
"Textbooks, Stereotypes and Anti-Feminine
Prejudices" (August-September 1975) and by Jorge-
Enrique Adoum on race prejudice in fairy tales
(January 1979).
The two articles below, by Prof. Hugo O. Ortega
and Beryle Banfield, present an analysis of some of
the ways in which race prejudice in school
textbooks presents a distorted picture of the facts.
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that these are
specific instances of a situation that exists in almost
every country in the world.
The authors took part in an international conference
on "Racism in Children's and School Textbooks"
held at Arnoldshain (Federal Republic of Germany)
in October 1978. The Conference was organized by
the World Council of Churches, a non-governmental
organization which, through its Commission of the
Churches on International Affairs, has consultative
status with Unesco.
Racism in textbooks
Through other eyes
by Hugo O. Ortega
THE ever-increasing store of children's literature forms a
fundamental element in the education of the child, opening
up the world of poetry, of fable and legend and bringing to
him the life stories of national and world heroes. The prestige of
the printed word and the importance that teachers attach to books
weigh heavily with children; it is through books that the founda¬
tions of their knowledge are laid.
The importance of books for transmitting information and values
prompted me to examine the "image" of the "Indian" (or, more
precisely, the indigenous inhabitant) as it appears in thirty
children's books recently published in Argentina. Eighty-three per
cent of the passages I analysed refer to the Indian in the past, a
past that stretches from pre-Columbian times, through the age in
which America was "discovered", the Spanish colonial period and
its end, to the era of independence and national construction. The
few references to the "Indian" of today bear no relation whatever
to the actual conditions of their lives.
Most of the texts which give prominence to the past deal with
occasions when the Indians came into contact with the troops of
Christopher Columbus and his successors. One of them tells how
Columbus sailed westwards in the service of the Spanish crown
until the day when "A sailor on the Pinta spied land. It was the
twelfth of October, 1492. Christopher Columbus went ashore on
an island populated with Indians, and called it San Salvador. The
Indians were wide-eyed with astonishment at the sight of the white
men. Columbus thought that he had reached the Indies, but he
had discovered a new world. Points to remember: Christopher
Columbus discovered America on the twelfth of October 1492".
The central idea the child is intended to grasp is that of
HUGO O. ORTEGA, Argentine educationist, is director of the Albert
Schweitzer College, at Mendoza, Argentina. He took part in the organiza¬
tion of the technical education programme of the Republic of Panama of
whose Panamerican Institute he was formerly the director. He has made a
study of indigenous groups in Argentina, in particular, of the Toba Indians.
His articles have appeared in several Latin American and Spanish magazi¬
nes and he was one of the contributing authors of Youth in Latin America,
published by Friendship Press, New York, in 1970.
"discovery". This is a concept of European historiography; it is an
ethnocentric concept since it presumes that the continent, its peo¬
ple and its wealth only acquired value because they were discove¬
red and recognized by the centre of the world, in other words,
Europe., It is hardly surprising, then, that civilization (clothes, big
ships, white men and the faculty for naming places and people)
should be equated with Europe and that barbarism (the Indians
and the "new" world) should be equated with America.
The artist who illustrated this text depicted a handsome and
angelic Columbus stepping ashore amidst a fierce and menacing
group of "Indians". The illustration is accompanied by exercises in
which the child is required to fill in blanks in an incomplete sen¬
tence; the words "Columbus discovered America" are given as the
correct words to complete the sentence: "When 	, he met
savages whom he called Indians". At that moment and for all time,
the indigenous people of this continent were wrongly labelled
"Indians". This fallacious generalization subsequently came to
describe the multitude of indigenous nations of America whose
people would be presented as half-naked "savages" garbed in
feathered head-dresses.
Another description of the "discovery" runs as follows:
"Land ahoy!
Land ! Land!
The Indies! The Indies!
At last! We've made it! An island! Palm trees!"
There's something moving over there in the trees...
Look! Half-naked men!
They're wearing feathers! They're signalling to us! They're
coming to us!"
"(...) The island was inhabited by men with copper-coloured
skins; who were half-naked. Columbus called them Indians, for he
was under the impression that he had reached the Indies, the
country he was looking for. However, the land was part of a
hitherto unknown continent which would later be called America".
The stereotype begins to take definite shape. The indigenous
people were half-naked and copper-coloured (in English they
would be dubbed redskins) and were generally referred to as
"Indians". Here lies the first major contradiction: a continent in-

What will this little girl of the South American high plateaux
learn from school textbooks of her people's history and culture?
All too often she will be offered a distorted, "Westernized"
picture which travesties the values of her people and their world.
habited by people with their own cultures is described as "un¬
known". Why do the authors insist on the European origin of
America, a continent inhabited for over 20,000 years by groups of
émigrés who originated in Central Asia and crossed over what is
now the Bering Strait?
This fundamental historical ambiguity, which the child learns
early in life, prevents him from understanding the link which exists
between Argentines (and Latin Americans in general) and the
great civilizations which flourished inx»ur..continent for thousands
of years. As after generation'of^children teat) this ac¬
count of 'thC'discovèrÇ*'," they are jndu*ced to denigrate thaXpart
of our "origins which goes back to men who lived at the beginning
ot the Bronze Age and to men who at the end of the Middle Ages
came into contact with a Genoese sailor and a handful of
Spaniards.
The authors of the second description of the "discovery" quot¬
ed above have also published an account of the foundation of the
city of Buenos Aires by the Spaniard Pedro de Mendoza in 1536:
"When they (the Spaniards) disembarked, the Indians were very
astonished. They had never seen men with white skin, nor such
clothing... Mendoza named the settlement 'Santa Maria del Buen
Aire'... The Indians offered them food: fruit and game. But conflict
soon broke out and provisions began to grow short. The settlers
set out in search of food and often had to fight the savages. One
day the Indians attacked the city and burned it".
Why, one might ask, do the authors fail to explain the changes
in the relationship between the "Indians" and the "white men"?
Why do they insinuate that the indigenous population was capri¬
cious and savage by nature, while keeping silent about the many
extortionate demands made on them by the Christian conquista¬
dors? What a contrast between this ethnocentric reading of history
and the following denunciation of the conquistadors penned by
the Spanish Dominican Fray Bartolomé de las Casas in 1513!
"When they arrived at the village [of Camaguey in Cuba] they
found the Indians living peacefully in their habitations. And yet
they increasingly wronged and scandalized them and, not content
with what the Indians offered them of their own free will, robbed
them of the few valuables they possessed. Even worse, some of
them attacked women and girls, for such is and always has been
the usual behaviour of the Spaniards in the Indies".
The illustrations to the story of Buenos Aires show the "sav¬
agery" of the attacking Indians and the superiority of the Euro¬
peans; Mendoza, dressed like a lord, founds the city and gives it its
name while an "Indian" squatting at his feet gapes in astonish¬
ment. The exercises which go with the text require the child to use
the words he has just learned: "savage, tribe, chief, bow, arrow" k
in order to complete such sentences as "The Indians lived in a f
state".
"When Columbus discovered
America he encountered savage
men, whom he called Indians."

children)

<![CDATA[
One third of the passages referring to "the Indian" in the age of
independence and national construction present their positive
characteristics; the rest are pejorative. In general, the texts give
prominence to three moments in Argentine history: the war of libe¬
ration beginning in the nineteenth century; the organization and
expansion of the nation; and the age of the liberal republic.
All the texts favourable to "the Indian" fall in the first period.
The author of a text for ten-year-old children recounts how, in
1819, "a chief of royal blood". Inca Atahualpa Huascaringa, a des¬
cendant of Peruvian sovereigns, also known as José Manuel de
Minoguyé, gave "30,000 armed Indians of his personal guard to
fight the Spaniards". Although the context aims to express the
idea that the indigenous population took part in the liberation
struggles waged by the criollos (Latin Americans of Spanish des¬
cent), the author does not say whether or not the proposal was
accepted, nor does he say what became of the chief and his
troops.
Elsewhere, the same author tells the story of Cumbay, chief of
the Chaco, who offered the Argentine general Manuel Belgrano
some 2,000 Indians to fight the Spanish forces. Yet again the read¬
er is not informed whether the offer was accepted nor whether the
indigenous people took part in the liberation of the nation. In each
case omission of this vital information suggests that the matter in
question was to be considered a trifling one and even pre¬
figures the decline of the indigenous nations; liberation brought no
improvement in their living conditions, indeed they fell victim to a
new domination which completed the process of making them a
marginal people.
A general textbook for eight- to nine-year-old children recounts
how, during the long process of national consolidation, "a landed
proprietor named Juan Manuel de Rosas, who was governor from
1820 to 1832, carried out a mopping-up campaign against the
Indians who were attacking the towns". The textbook does not
indicate which Indians were concerned, for many of them had
come to terms with Rosas and were not involved in these attacks.
It does not explain why the indigenous peoples felt such animosity
towards the criollos; nor does it place the facts in the context of
the criollo policy of achieving secure frontiers, expanding to the
limits of the former Spanish vice-royalty, and occupying all the fer¬
tile land for stock-raising and agricultural purposes. Their historic
goal of dominion was in total opposition to the aims of the indige¬
nous peoples who had enjoyed free use of these lands for thou¬
sands of years before the arrival of the Spaniards and criollos.
Nor, indeed, is there any mention of Rosas' conviction that "the
Indian problem would only be resolved by their total submission or
by the extermination of the recalcitrant among them, that is to say
by pursuing the methods used during the Spanish conquest"
(Ernesto Palacio, History of Argentina, 1515 to 1955, Buenos
Aires, 1977). The children are not told that during Rosas' campaign
more than ten thousand Indian warriors were liquidated and four
thousand taken prisoner. All these historical omissions reinforce
the idea of the indigenous population as "savage Indians", "irra¬
tional" and "barbaric" enemies of civilization.
Another work from the same publishers, intended for seven- to
eight-year-old children, affirms that: "It is difficult today to ima¬
gine what life was like in the countryside in the past. The Indians
had left the towns but were still masters of the plains. Can you
imagine how dangerous it was to cross the pampas? Think of the
long, hard roads, the wild animals, and the Indians always lying in
wait". The author shows concern only for those who lived in the
small towns in the interior of the country, for their security and
their anxieties. But what of the indigenous peoples who never for¬
med a majority or even a significant minority in any creóle town?
What were the feelings of these peoples who had once been mas¬
ters of the land living free of the menace of better-armed enemies?
This ethnocentric reading of history gives children a totally false
picture of the facts. It presents a slanted account of the confronta¬
tion which led to the defeat of the indigenous peoples. The
"Indians" are depicted as wild animals of the jungle, always lying
in wait for their prey.
How does this picture of the "Indian" of our historic past com¬
pare with the image of the indigenous Argentine of today to whom
reference is made in some seventeen per cent of the texts?
According to certain authors: "In the Chaquena region today,
some Matacos and Tobas still live in the primitive state. They gen¬
erally work at weaving, at picking cotton and cutting sugar cane.
30
From the carob bean they make a drink called aloja (a kind of
mead) of which they are very fond. The preparation of this drink is
the occasion for festivities during which large quantities are
drunk." Why, of all the aspects of the Mataco and Toba culture,
do the authors choose to emphasize their "primitive state" and the
fact that they are makers and festive drinkers of aloja? Why are we
not told of their concept of the communal nature of property, of
the way they share their food, of the solidity of their family ties, the
absence of sexual promiscuity, their skill at building cool dwellings
in a sub-tropical climate, their strong religious beliefs and the deco¬
rum of their social life? If they live in a "primitive state", this is not
from choice, but because they are the descendants of conquered
peoples, forced to inhabit the poorest and most inhospitable
regions of a rich republic. This then ¡s a highly biased account
which completely ignores the special values and characteristics
that have ensured the survival of these ancient peoples.
In another work, the same authors explain that "the Puna (a
region of north-west Argentina) is virtually uninhabited; the native
element is predominant there; it consists of the Coyas who can
stand the rarefied air of the mountains better than the white man".
Although the name of the tribe (Coya) is mentioned, the general
reference is to a dehumanized thing, the "native element", as
opposed to the white "man". Even more serious is the fact that the
Coya is depicted as organically different from the white man as if
the human race in general could not live in the mountains after a
period of acclimatization! In this text, the Coya is portrayed as just
another denizen of the region, on a par with the llama, the vicuna
and the alpaca.
A handicrafts guide for eight-year-old children explains how to
make a doll, a shadow theatre, a farm, a dining-room, a colonial
building, a piglet and other objects. The young reader is also
shown how to make just two figures the mythical figure of
Father Christmas and an Indian and his hut. Thus the indigenous
Argentine is placed firmly in the world of objects and myth; he is
not seen as a real person. The "Indian" is a thing that children can
make out of paper and string and paint; his hut is not even a replica
ofan Argentine dwelling, but a stereotyped imitation of the teepee
of the Sioux Indians of the great prairies of North America, as
depicted throughout the world by the mass media.
Yet another text makes play with a similar stereotype. The hero
of the story is a little boy whose name, Gerónimo, inevitably
evokes the famous Apache chief who defied the federal troops
of the United States from 1850 to 1880. Why did not the author
choose an indigenous name from the thousands still in use in our
tribes today?
In a "note to the teacher", the author of a book of stories for
children of pre-school age explains that "in addition to fairies and
other magical creatures, the characters children feel most affection
for are other children, toys and animals dogs, cats, rabbits, hor¬
ses, ducks, and squirrels. The teacher should take care to present
each animal in accordance with its real characteristics since this
helps the child to situate himself in the world and to under¬
stand it (...). It is the task of the school to achieve this".
Later on in the same book we come across a piece of dialogue
between children who are "playing at Indians": "I am the chief",
says Luis, "because I am the biggest." "I am the doctor of the
tribe", says Jorge, "because I have got a satchel. " "I am an Indian
hunter", cries Carlos, "because I have some sticks pointed like
arrows." Then chief Blue Eagle speaks: "Come on, Indians, let's go
into the forest." The story ends with a song: "I'm an Indian, I'm an
Indian, Me killpuma, I'm an Indian, I'm an Indian, And I eat maize,
I'm an Indian, I'm an Indian, I'm off to bed".
The writer is putting into the heads of five-year-old children the
notion that chiefs are chosen for their physical stature, whereas, in
fact, wisdom and experience are the most important considera¬
tions in a complex selection process; similarly, the medicine man is
chosen for his spirituality and religious knowledge. No one can
claim any special right simply because he possesses a particular
object. An Indian does not become a fisherman because his father
has given him a boat this would be more in line with the way
things are done among the wealthier classes in the west but
because his father and, indeed, the whole tribe have taught him to
fish, an activity that is practised collectively in a communally
owned boat.
The indigenous Argentines do not refer to themselves as
"¡ndians". We know that some tribes refer to each other aspaisa-

How
racism
takes
root
by Beryle Banfield
EXTENSIVE research on the develop¬
ment of racial attitudes in children
has led to general agreement on sev¬
eral important points. By the age of four,
most children are aware of their own racial
identity and the racial identity of others.
By the age of about 10 years, the atti¬
tudes of most children will have been
firmly crystallized and will reflect the racial
attitudes dominant in their society. These
research findings have important implica¬
tions for those concerned with the elimina¬
tion of racism in children's materials.
Racism in textbooks is usually most evi¬
dent in five important areas: the historical
perspective from which the material is pre¬
sented; the characterization of Third World
peoples; the manner in which their cus¬
toms and traditions are depicted; the termi¬
nology used to describe the peoples and
their culture and the type of language as¬
cribed to them; and the nature of illustra¬
tions.
History in textbooks is usually presented
from a Eurocentric perspective omitting or
distorting the history of the Third World
peoples prior to the European contact.
Third World people are portrayed as in¬
capable of having developed their own
institutions prior to the coming of the
Europeans. Encroachment on the land of
the indigenous peoples is glorified as the
opening up of the frontier by gallant and
courageous European men and women.
The slaughter of indigenous people is
glossed over and the defenders of their
homelands are depicted as marauding
"savages" and cruel murderers. The colo¬
nization and slavery experiences are pre¬
sented as beneficial to Third World people
providing them with discipline and skills
previously unknown to them. Rejection of
the people's own culture in favour of
assimilation into that of the European is
regarded as desirable. The following
excerpts are illustrative.
"Fighting broke out between the Maori
and Europeans over whose land was
whose just as in earlier days there had been
battles between one Maori tribe and ano¬
ther. But at last the fighting stopped."
"During all the troubles the new settlers
built towns, made farms and spread
throughout New Zealand. From time to
time the Maori tribes disagreed with the
new ways but by this time the European
settlers had an army to help keep the
peace."
In this passage, the taking of Maori land
and the imposition of foreign rule and cul¬
ture is glossed over. Justification of Euro¬
pean actions is implied by the reference to
earlier wars between Maori groups. The
destruction of Maori culture is dismissed
and the use of force to impose an alien cul¬
ture is justified as necessary to keep the
peace.
"The Eastern Woodland Indians did not
develop a highly advanced culture. But
their culturedid make it possible for them
to live successfully in ways suited to their
needs..."
"Beginning in the mid 1600's the world
of the Eastern Woodland Indians suddenly
changed. The Indians faced Europeans,
who were people with more advanced cul¬
tures. These Europeans had better wea¬
pons, better tools, and more advanced
forms of political organization."
This text clearly evaluated the culture of
the Eastern Woodland Indians from a Euro¬
centric viewpoint. The society they develo¬
ped was in many ways more politically
sophisticated than that of the Europeans in
terms of the participation of women in the
political decision-making process and the
general level of citizen involvement. The
political organization of the six nations of
the Iroquois Confederacy served as the
model for the colonies when they moved to
set up a new nation.
Illustrations provide powerful reinforce¬
ment for the racial stereotypes projected in
textual materials and play a considerable
role in forming a child's first impressions of
other peoples. Such stereotypes have now
become internationalized. There is the Afri¬
can child, naked except for a bracelet on
her ankle; the Mexican, wearing a som¬
brero and reclining under a cactus, the half-
naked American Indian, in a feather head¬
dress and carrying a bow and arrow, the
Chinese coolies and the blond American
cowboy.
These are caricatural figures, as true and
as false as any caricature; their danger is
that they polarize the child's perceptions
and in so doing conceal from him the
immense achievements of other peoples
and the rich variety of other cultures.

IN his recent science-fiction story about
the development of a "wonder boy"
the American author, Joseph Shallit,
describes an experiment conducted by a
psychologist. Doctor Elliot, who, by ex¬
posing an embryo's brain to special rays,
succeeds in activating to an extraordinary
extent the child's aptitudes and in creating
a considerable and constantly increasing
disparity between his physical age and his
mental age.
At the age of one, Donny's mental age is
that of a three- to four-year-old; at two,
that of a child of ten, and so on. The head¬
long but unilateral development of Donny's
aptitudes, the obvious incompatibility bet¬
ween his appearance and his actual age
begin to embarrass seriously those around
him, first and foremost, his father and
mother. Before long, Donny is preparing to
eliminate his parents who have become
Obstacles to the realization of his selfish
ambitions.
Shallit's gloomy tale, of course, exagger¬
ates the dangers of too intensive develop¬
ment of children's mental aptitudes. But
the uncommon situation of a "miracle
child" always contains the potential danger
of deviation and the monstrous develop¬
ment of the personality.
The Soviet educationalist Anton Maka¬
renko has devoted a chapter of his remark¬
able Book of Parents to an experiment
which somewhat resembles that of Dr.
Elliot.
True, Piotr Ketov, who had decided to
make his only son a famous man, did not
have access to a fantastic "mind maturer",
but this was more than made up for by the '
excessive and unthinking love of the
mother, her anguished fear for her son and
the attitude of the father, who systema^
tically placed the son in exceptional situ¬
ations, subordinating the entire life of the
family to the single task of developing the
intellect and talents of his child.
Victor, the son, quickly outstrips the
other children of his age and shows not the
slightest interest in them. At five, he
speaks Russian and German correctly; at
ten, he is studying the classics; at twelve,
he can read Schiller in the original and skips
the fifth form; at seventeen, he enters the
mathematics faculty and astounds his pro¬
fessors by his brilliant talents and scholar¬
ship. In short, he has followed the typical
path of a gifted child. But, in other res¬
pects, he has become a thorough-going
egoist, cold, cynical and calculating, indif¬
ferent to anything not connected with his
success and his pleasures. Victor's story
has a tragically banal ending:
"Coming from the kitchen, his mother
rushed towards him and said in a trembling
and weary voice:

What should
we do
with whizzkids?
by Arthur V. Petrovsky
A boarding school for exceptionally gifted children from distant parts of the U.S.S.R. has
been set up in Moscow on the urging of Academician Andrei Kolmogorov, a leading
Soviet mathematician. Each year over 200 teenagers from the central and southern
regions of European Russia are accepted at the school, which Is attached to Moscow
University. After a course of study in which maths and physics play a major part, almost
all the pupils go on to higher educational institutions specializing in science. At least half
enter Moscow University or the Moscow Physico-Technical Institute. Similar schools have
been established in Leningrad, Novosibirsk and Kiev. Here, Kolmogorov and his students
enjoy a moment of relaxation between lectures.
Victor, could you go to the chemist's?
The medicine is ready and paid for. It is
urgent.
Turning his tousled head on his pillow,
Piotr Alexandrovitch Ketov looked at his
son; a forced smile was on his lips. The
sight of his grown son gave him pleasure
despite the suffering caused by his ulcer.
Victor looked at his mother and replied
with a cold smile:
No, I cannot. My friends are waiting for
me. I'm taking the key. "
The presence of a gifted child in a family
does not make the educational tasks faced
by the family unit any easier. On the con¬
trary, it makes them more difficult. This is
why it is necessary not only to create
favourable conditions for the development
of the child's talent, to feed his extra¬
ordinary energy, but also to pay particular
attention to encouraging those aspirations
which will enable him to become a part of
the community.
He must be made aware that his great
aptitudes do not give him the right to make
greater demands on those around him, but
that they, on the contrary, especially his
parents and teachers, have the right to
demand more of him. If he understands
that his talent creates not only rights but
also special duties, then a favourable deve¬
lopment of his personality can be expected.
Today, it is generally accepted that a
pedagogical doctrine concerning gifted
children reflects the general principles and
pedagogical methods used in a society.
In order to understand this phenomenon
of gifted children a phenomenon more
widespread than is generally believedwe

must bear in mind that gifted children
remain children with all the special attrib¬
utes of children, even if these have been
modified and transformed by the exceptio¬
nal character of their gifts. Psychologists
are interested in gifted children not
because they want to record their achieve¬
ments but because they want to try to pick
out those characteristics of their person¬
alities which make us consider them to be
gifted children.
If we only take the exceptional traits of a
gifted child into account, he is liable to see
himself as an exceptional being and to
become arrogant, presumptuous or
unhealthily timid.
Gifted children easily perform school
exercises which are beyond the compre¬
hension of older children. However, chil¬
dren do not develop in a uniform manner;
nor is an individual child's intellectual, prac¬
tical, moral and affective development uni¬
form either. Thus, it is possible for a gifted
child to surpass all the other children of his
age in a specific field while lagging behind
in all the others.
Even when those around him consider
him to be a prodigy, a child remains a child.
And this simple proposition must govern
our attitude towards him. This means that
he must be given 'intellectual and creative
work corresponding to his special capabili¬
ties in a specific field and be provided with
the means to succeed. He must not be han¬
dicapped in this respect. Nor is it desirable
to attempt to speed up his intellectual
development artificially or to want him to
skip a class and outstrip his age group, not
because he "could not stand the strain" (a
greatly exaggerated danger) but because,
in such a situation, personality develop¬
ment may be upset.
The child prodigy who, for example,
solves a number of complex equations and
then returns enthusiastically to his toys, is
sometimes laughed at and made aware of
the illusory nature of his maturity. This can
The education of highly
gifted children raises many
questions. Should they be
taught in special schools
for child prodigies? Should
they be schooled with less
able children, at the risk of
becoming apathetic and
losing their Intellectual
sharpness? Should they be
pushed to their limits and
treated as if they were
older than their years?
Many approaches have
been tried; each has

disadvantages. Left, three-

induce morosity, arrogance and mistrust.
We should, therefore, concern ourselves,
first and foremost, not with the develop¬
ment of his gifts, but with the harmonious
formation of his personality of which intel¬
lectual aptitudes are only one element.
An unthinking desire to widen the gap
between a child's mental and real age could
lead to a situation in which a gifted child,
while moving out of the child's world from
an intellectual point of view, cannot find
his place in the adult world because of his
moral and affective immaturity. These
internal contradictions are a source of con¬
flict and could lead to a highly explosive
situation.
Nowadays, the problem of talented chil¬
dren and their education is a major social
problem and a concern of the State. In the
Soviet Union, the detection of special
talents has always been aided by various
competitive examinations and through
olympiads in mathematics, physics, bio¬
logy, chemistry and literature held all over
the country every year and which attract
hundreds of thousands of students. But
this method can do no more than reveal the
"raw material" for further action.
Today, experts are devoting themselves
to this task. Several boarding and special¬
ized schools have already been established
to offer the most favourable conditions for
the development of the aptitudes of stu¬
dents in mathematics and in other fields.
The author of this article has seen this
system in operation at one of the special
mathematics schools. The students work
under the supervision of teachers from the
Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of
Moscow University. The preliminary selec¬
tion and the development of the mathema¬
tical aptitudes of the children take place at
an evening school for mathematics at
which the courses are given by university
seniors assisted by final-year students from
the special mathematics school. Thus,
when the entry examinations for the
mathematics school are held (examinations
every bit as serious as those for admission
to higher educational institutions), the
school administrators and the representa¬
tives of Moscow University can choose
from among the pick of the students.
This is the start of a life of intensive and
fascinating work for "the happy few". In
addition to the usual scholastic courses,
they have to follow a special programme,
attend lectures by university professors,
take part in seminars and solve extremely
complicated mathematical problems.
Although emphasis is on the specialized
disciplines, there is no lowering of the level
demanded in other subjects of the school
programme. It should be noted that the
child prodigies, contrary to preconceived
notions, are not "eggheads" with puny
bodies, but children full of vigour and the
joy of living, excellent at sports who say
jokingly: "We're attending a physical edu¬
cation school with a mathematical bent".
But mathematics, music and chess have
always been a special case. Talent in these
fields shows itself at an early stage and a
child with a gift for music or mathematics
can be singled out very early on.
But what of other aptitudes which are
not so easy to detect? For several years, for
example, a school sponsored by the Chem¬
istry Faculty of Moscow University has
been in operation in Moscow. The system
of olympiads for districts, cities, regions,
republics and, finally for the whole Soviet
Union offers the opportunity to distinguish
from the mass of students the best of the
literary-inclined, geographers or biologists
and to undertake the creation of new
specialized secondary schools for these
students.
Another important aspect of the way in
which these schools operates is that even
the strongest students do not feel that they
are "different", "not like the others",
because the general level of these schools
is very high. They are, in fact, places for
large-scale, long-term experimentation,
where children receive the training for their
social role that could not be provided by
the family.
The ways and means of detecting talent
and encouraging it are the subject of end¬
less discussions which are far from being
resolved. How and where should we teach
these children? Should we educate them
like the others and let the talented ones
emerge spontaneously?
The experiment continues for benefit of
the only truly privileged persons: the chil¬
dren.

nos, and this is how they wish to be known. It is insulting to make
the "Indian" use the infinitive ("me kill puma"). This may well raise
a laugh in the nursery school, but not from the indigenous pupils
for whom, even today, Castilian Spanish is the language of the
dominant culture. The author has forgotten his own warning note
to the teachers "animals must be presented in accordance with
their real characteristics". Why did he not follow his own advice
when describing the native peoples of his own land?
The picture that emerges from all this leads to the following con¬
clusions:
the indigenous Argentine is a creature of the past;
little is known about the different aboriginal peoples and their
cultural characteristics they are all "Indians";
the native American is depicted in pejorative fashion as a half-
naked savage wearing a feathered head-dress, irrational and
inferior to the white European;
the emphasis on the "discovery" of the continent over-values
Europe to the detriment of ancient American civilizations and
covers up Europe's appropriation of the continent;
the indigenous person is often denigrated and considered an
object children play at Indians, make models of Indians and their
huts;
history omits information essential to the understanding of the
complex causes of the decadence of the indigenous Argentine
nations;
instead of presenting the true situation of the "Indian" there is a
tendency to reproduce North American stereotypes teepees,
Gerónimo, Blue Eagle.
All this amounts to a process of negation, of a kind of cultural
genocide which in turn leads to an indirect form of real
genocide no less serious because it is indirect which consists of
depriving an important ethnic minority of a share in the resources
of their land of origin.

Victoria Ocampo
On 28 January 1979 Victoria Ocampo
passed away at her villa in San Isidro near
Buenos Aires (Argentina). Her death marks
the disappearance of a towering figure in
Latin American culture, who in addition to
working as a writer devoted her long life
(she was eighty-eight when she died) to
promoting contact and understanding be¬
tween cultures. To her mansion at San
Isidro she welcomed many leading world
thinkers and creative artists including
Rabindranath Tagore, Ortega y Gasset, Igor
Stravinsky, Paul Valéry, Pablo Neruda,
André Malraux, Graham Greene and Julian
Huxley, Unesco's first Director-General.
The pages of Sur, the review she founded
in 1931, brought to Latin America the great
intellectual and artistic movements of the
age, and presented to the public such major
contemporary Latin American writers as
Jorge-Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier and
Julio Cortázar. Sur and the publications
which appeared under its aegis became a
powerful instrument of International cultu¬
ral co-operation.
Apart from her efforts to promote the
meeting of cultures, a task which is central
to Unesco's work, Unesco owes this great
Argentinian a generous legacy: in 1973 she
donated to Unesco a group of estates in¬
cluding her spacious villa at San Isidro. In
accordance with her wishes, the villa will
be used "for promotion, research, experi¬
mentation and development of activities
related to culture, literature, art and social
communication, which' are aimed at im¬
proving the quality of human life".
With the death of Victoria Ocampo, her
beautiful residence will be converted, as
she wished, into a centre of creation and
cultural co-operation. Unesco is currently
studying various ways of using the Villa
Ocampo, including a project for holding
there this year an international symposium
on translation, a subject in which Victoria
Ocampo was particularly interested and
which was the theme of one of the most
recent issues of Sur. The life and work of
Victoria Ocampo were evoked by Jacques
Rigaud in an article published in the
August-September 1977 issue of the Unesco
Courier.
The tribute to Roger Caillois, written by Jean d'Ormesson and published in
the February 1979 issue of the Unesco Courier, is an extract from a longer
article to be published shortly in the quarterly review Diogenes Editor.

Commission Studies
Democratization
of Communication
Should there be an international
code of ethics for journalists? If so,
who should be responsible for drawing
it up and administering it? And what
about the responsibilities of those who
own or control the media? Should there
be a code of ethics for them as well?
And what are the interests of the public,
the "consumers" of mass media, in all
of this?
These were a few of the questions
raised by the International Commission
for the Study of Communication
problems at its fourth session in
Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, in January.
Under the chairmanship of Mr. Sean
MacBride, Nobel and Lenin Peace
Prizewinner and former foreign minister
of Ireland, the Commission examined
reactions of governments, non
governmental organizations and private
institutions to its interim report which
had been presented to the Unesco
General Conference last October. It also
adopted tentative guidelines for the
preparation of its final report to be
published at the end of this year.
In addition to the possibility or
advisability of a code of ethics, the
Commission discussed, among other
topics, such issues as concrete measures
which could be taken towards the
establishment of a new world
information and communication order,
and how to achieve a greater
democratization of communication.
Commission members were divided
on the code of ethics question. They
noted that the subject had been
discussed at a seminar in Stockholm
sponsored by the Commission in April,
1978, and in which news agencies,
newspapers and broadcasting
organizations had been widely
represented. There had, however, been
no unanimity on the question.
The Malian newspaper
Kibaru has a network of
voluntary
"correspondents" who
help the editorial staff to
adapt its contents to meet
the needs of its rural
readers.
While several members made
persuasive arguments in favour of an
international code of ethics, others
expressed strong reservations about the
idea, although agreeing that such
regulations might be useful at the
national level. In the end, the
Commission asked its Secretariat to
prepare a comparative study of national
codes of ethics or conduct, press
councils, advertising codes, ombudsmen
and other ways of setting standards, in
order to see what common elements
might be distinguished as a basis for a
possible international code.
In the discussion on democratization
of communication, several aspects were
stressed. They included access to news
sources; access to and participation in
the mass media; democratization of
management and professional decision¬
making in the mass media, and the right
to reply. In. this connection, it was
suggested that the Commission might
study what would be required to bring
up to date the Convention on the Right
to Reply, adopted 25 years ago, but
ratified so far by only four countries.
There was also a long discussion of
ownership, control and financing of the
mass media. Agreeing that the poorer
countries of the Third World had no
option but public ownership of the
media, the Commission urged an
examination of various models of. state
financing which allow for autonomy of
operation. Examples were cited from
Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, the
Federal Republic of Germany, India,
the United States and Egypt to illustrate
the wide variety of experiences in this
field, especially insofar as broadcast
media were concerned.
In still another discussion,
Commission members agreed that
communication is such an important
part of modern everyday life that
]]>

<![CDATA[
understanding of it must be taught in
primary and secondary schools, perhaps
in the form of "communication
appreciation" courses similar to "art
appreciation" or "music appreciation"
courses now offered in many schools.
Access to and participation in the media
require first of all a knowledge of how
they operate, it was suggested, and
furthermore, if citizens are to take part
effectively in the formulation of
communication policies, they must
know what the options are.
The Commission asked its
Secretariat to furnish additional
documentation on a wide range of
subjects before its next meeting,
scheduled for 26 to 30 March in New
Delhi, India. Subsequent meetings will
be held in Mexico in June and in Paris
in September.
Asian Ministers
Discuss
Communication
Policies
Ministers and experts from 23
countries of Asia and Oceania met in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from 5 to 14
February to discuss communication
policies for their countries and for the
region.
The meeting marked a crucial point
in the history of man's efforts to
achieve better communication, Unesco
Director-General Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow told the closing session. He
congratulated the 184 delegates for
bringing "the international community
one step nearer to general agreement
and solidarity in regard to
communication."
The "Kuala Lumpur Declaration",
which the conference adopted by
acclamation, established the essential
link between community and
communication, he added, and it also
emphasized the importance of
communication for development
planning. Indeed, he said, without
communication "no social structure can
be formed, no society can unify its
destiny and work for its own
advancement."
Unesco TV
Programme
Launches
International Year
of the Child
Said Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: "It is
my hope that this year the smiles of
children will light up the world and give
us faith and conviction in our struggle
for peace and progress".
And Leonid Brezhnev added: "Our
purpose is to teach children to be
generous, to live with all people,
regardless of nationality or colour, in
friendship as good neighbours, and to
respect work. We want to teach them to
work for the benefit of all people".
As for Jimmy Carter, he declared:
"We will be eager to help others...
Working through Unicef and other
United Nations agencies... I think we
can enhance the opportunity for better
clothing, housing, food, medical care
and education on the part of children in
all nations".
The occasion was a special television
programme, co-produced by Unesco and
the first channel of the French state
television, to launch the International
Year of the Child, 1979. Broadcast in
France on Sunday, 28 January, the
programme is being adapted into many
different languages and is expected to be
shown in some 40 to 50 countries.
In addition to filmed messages from
seven world leaders, the programme
includes songs and dances by children's
groups from various regions of the
globe. Besides Messrs. Giscard
d'Estaing, Brezhnev and Carter, the
chiefs of state include Presidents Carlos-
Andrés Peréz of Venezuela, Josip Broz
Tito of Yugoslavia and Kenneth Kaunda
of Zambia and H.M. Bhumibol
Adulyadej, the King of Thailand. There
are also messages by Mr. Amadou-
Mahtar M'Bow, Director-General of
Unesco; Mr. Mahamed Mili, Director-
General of the International
Telecommunications Union, and Mr.
Henri R. Labouisse, Executive Director
of Unicef. The programme is presented
by Peter Ustinov.
This international television
programme is, however, only one of
many Unesco activities being carried out
in connection with IYC. Others, already
undertaken or planned for future
months, include: a series of co-
production programmes in co-operation
with national TV organizations; special
issues of the Unesco Courier; a
commemorative poster by the Cuban
artist René Portocarrero; a worldwide
children's drawing contest being carried
out simultaneously in 85. countries under
the sponsorship of Unesco, Unicef and
the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees; a picture book entitled "A
World for Everybody"; an International
Children's Day at Unesco Headquarters,
3 October, 1979; a joint Unesco-Unicef
pavilion at the "Man and His World"
exhibition in Montreal, Canada; photo
sheets, special radio programmes and
other audio and visual material; and,
last but not least, a series of gala
concerts in Japan for the benefit of
children's projects in the least developed
countries.
In a more general manner, many of
Unesco's programme activities during
the year are being oriented to reflect the
needs and concerns of children. In
education, for example, the major
regional and international conferences
being organized this year, such as the
37th session of the International
Conference on Education, will take into
account preoccupations related to IYC.
Particular attention is being paid to the
extension and improvement of pre¬
school education and to the particular
problems of handicapped children.
With respect to social sciences,
efforts are being made to improve the
protection of the rights of children with
special emphasis on the situation of
children of migrant workers. As far as
culture is concerned, there is a series of
activities aimed at the promotion and
development of children's books and
children's libraries.

<![CDATA[
Most Often
Translated: Lenin
and the Bible
Lenin, Shakespeare, Agatha Christie,
Jules Verne and Enid Blyton may have,
little else in common, but they are
among the authors most frequently
published in translation. Lenin, in fact,
heads the list of authors; the Bible
remains the book most frequently
published in different languages.
This is revealed by the 27th edition
of Unesco's Index Translationum, just
published and covering some 46,384
translations of books published in 62
countries in 1974. The translation
business is booming these days say the
Unesco editors, noting that the first
edition of the international bibliography
listed only 8,570 translations for the
year 1948.
Books for children are not listed as a
separate category in the Index
Translationum, but in honour of
International Year of the Child the
Unesco staff have made some attempt
to evaluate translations of such works.
To the extent that the Bible is read by
children, it ranks as one of the most
often translated texts, followed by Alf
laila wa-laila ("Tales from the Arabian
Nights"). Comic books are also often
translated, and these include not only
the well-known Walt Disney
productions, but also comic book
versions of a number of classics of
world literature, history and religion. In
addition to the ever-popular Enid
Blyton, the most often translated
authors of children's books include
Caroline Keene (spelled "Quine" for the
French editions), Captain W.E. Johns,
Louisa M. Alcott and James Fenimore
Cooper, but the list also contains such
great storytellers as Alexandre Dumas,
Robert Louis Stevenson, Erich Kaestner,
Mark Twain, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,
A.A. Milne and Lewis Carroll.
Wat Mahatat, the principal
temple of the ancient Thai
capital of Sukhothai.
Save Sukhothai
A New Unesco
Appeal
Sukhothai is not only the cradle of
Thai civilisation. It is at the same time
"one of those very special places where
the culture of a nation, having attained
the plenitude of its powers, transcends
that nation's own frontiers to enrich the
universal heritage."
It was in these terms that Unesco
Director-General Amadou-Mahtar
M'Bow launched an international appeal
in January to preserve Sukhothai,
threatened by decay. In Sukhothai, he
said, architects, sculptors and craftsmen
had created an urban landscape to
whose majesty and beauty the remains
still standing bore silent witness. From
this capital of the first Thai Empire,
established between the 13 th and 15 th
centuries, Theravada Buddhism began
to spread its influence throughout the
region. The sculpture of Sukhothai
represented a uniquely original
contribution to religious art in which the
concept of the Supreme Being was
idealized and the figure of the walking
Buddha made its first appearance.
Today Sukhothai with its 126
monuments is in danger from a two-
pronged assault by natural and social
phenomena. On the one hand,
vegetation is speeding the decay of the
monuments and rainwater is eating away
their foundations. On the other hand,
the activities of the local population are
encroaching upon the archaeological site
and an increasing flow of tourists is
threatening its harmony and serenity.
The Royal Government of Thailand,
determined to preserve Sukhothai both
as a religious centre and as part of the
national heritage, has designated it as an
"historical park", and with expert
assistance from Unesco has established a
master plan for restoration of the
monuments, the development of
excavations, flood control, relocation of
a number of villages and re-creation of
Sukhothai's authentic setting through
the encouragement of traditional
cultural activities.
It has already mustered considerable
resources to carry out the plan, but has
also asked Unesco to make an appeal
for international solidarity in the form
of technical co-operation or financial
assistance.

Mexican Project Wins Unesco
Architecture Prize for 1978
A plan for the step-by-step
conversion of an ancient historic
building in Yahualica, Mexico, into
office space for the city administration
has been awarded the 1978 Unesco Prize
for Architecture.
The plan, devised by seven students
of the Technological Institute for
Higher Studies of the West, in
Guadalajara, was selected from among
234 entries by a jury composed of
eminent personalities from the
architectural profession. The theme of
the competition had called for
participants to prepare a study of the
space required for the municipal
administration of a town of between
10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants.
Presenting the award on behalf of
the Director-General at a ceremony at
Unesco Headquarters in January,
Mr. Federico Mayor, the Deputy
Director-General, expressed his pleasure
that the winners (Ana Martung, Carmen
Ortiz, Carlos Ashida, Víctor Pérez
Sandi, Rafael Gutiérrez, Salvador de
Alba and Gaspar Alarcón) were so
young. Unesco, he added, would follow

with interest the course of the project
through to its realization.
The Unesco Prize for Architecture,
which was established in 1969 and is
jointly sponsored by the International
Union of Architects, is awarded every
three years. Previous winners have
included architects from Japan, the
' USSR and India.
Canada in Paris
"Canada Days": from 11 to 23 May
the permanent delegation of Canada will
present at Unesco House various aspects
of Canadian culture. Events will include
theatrical performances, exhibitions,
concerts, film showings with the
participation of well known artists.
Today's World
a Portrait
in Figures
What country has the most television
sets in proportion to its population? The
United States, right?
Wrong. It's Monaco, according to
the 1977 edition of the Unesco
Statistical Yearbook, just published.
The latest figures available show the tiny
principality with 640 TV receivers per
thousand inhabitants, while the USA
had only 571. Together with Guam (540
per thousand), they are the only places
in the world with more than one
television set for every two people.
Canada follows close behind, however,
with 428 per thousand. Then come
Bermuda (368), France and Sweden (363
each) and Australia (351).
In the International Year of the
Child, with world attention focussed on
the needs and problems of children in
all countries, the Statistical Yearbook
reveals sharp differences in school
enrolment rates in the different regions.
For children under 11, the rate was 95.5
per cent for Europe, for example,
compared with 87.7 per cent in Oceania,
63.5 per cent in Asia and only 51.1 per
cent in Africa. Secondary school
enrolment varies from 2 per cent in
Upper Volta to 92 per cent in the
Netherlands. And as for books for
children, 12 African countries together
produced only 201 titles in 1975 and
1976, while the United States published
2,210 titles in 1976 alone, the United
Kingdom 2,575 and Japan 2,217.
Fifteenth of a series which began in
1963, the 1977 Statistical Yearbook gives
in its 1064 pages a portrait in figures of
today's world in the fields of education
(such as levels of schooling, enrolment,
expenditure), science and technology
(manpower, spending, indicators of
scientific and technological
development), culture and
communication (libraries, publishing,
newspapers and periodicals, newsprint
consumption, films, radio and
television).
The United States with 61,222,000
copies of daily newspapers in 1975, and
Japan with 57,830,000 remain the
largest overall consumers of daily
papers. However, when circulation is
measured against population, the
Swedes turn out to be the world
champion newspaper readers, with 572
copies per thousand population. They
are followed by the German Democratic
Republic, Iceland and Norway, in that
order. At the other end of the scale, the
Yearbook lists some 38 countries and
territories which do not have even a
single daily newspaper.
