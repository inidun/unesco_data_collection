THE SECOND INVASION
OF THE MARTIANS
1989, by Anatoly Smolich
Perlnaps heralding a
peaceful invasion from the
Red Planet, this strange
creature with the allure of an
unidentified fiying object
seems to stare at us with
surprise, or perhaps
sadness, as it tumbles from
Mars to a troubled Earth. In
this salute to H.G. Wells, a
Russian painter makes a
hopeful appeal for a world at
peace.

HUBERT REEVES
talks to
Baligat EInadi and Adel Rifaat
Montreal-born astrophysicist Hubert
Reeves Is Director of Research at
the French National Centre for
Scientific Research (CNRS). An
accomplished popularizer of
science, he has made astronomy
accessible to a wide non-specialist
readership through a number of
best-selling books, including Atoms
of Silence (IVIIT Press, 1984) and
The Hour of Delight: Cosmic
Evolution, Order and Complexity
(W.H. Freeman and Company,
1991), and two Illustrated books.
Poussières d'Etoiles (1984) and
Compagnons de Voyage (1992, in
collaboration with Jelica
Obrenovitch), both published by
Editions du Seuil, Paris. In this
exclusive interview, he discusses
current knowledge of the universe
and gives his views on a number of
urgent world problems.
It is rare for a scientist also to be a popu¬
larizer of science. In your case, you are even
a poet as well
I realized quite early on that there was
something about astronomy that a lot of
people found interesting. In my case, it all
began with my own children. When we were
staying in holiday villages, we would get
together and naturally we would all talk
about the things we knew. In the evenings, as
we sat outside beneath the beautiful cloud¬
less sky, I would talk about the stars. As I
went on from the stars to the planets, and
from the birth »of the universe to life on
Earth, it was inevitable that I would try to
share with my listeners my sense of wonder
at the adventure of the cosmos.
To my great surprise, I found that more
and more people were willing to listen to my
way of explaining things, which combined
scientific language and touches of poetry.
This encouraged me to write my first book.
Atoms of Silence, which very nearly turned
out to be my last, since the pubHshers I sent
the manuscript to did not have the same
reaction as my audience of holiday-makers.
Altogether, some thirty-odd publishers
rephed, in so many words, that nobody was
interested in the problems of astronomy.
In the end, the French publishing house
Le Seuil agreed to take the risk of publishing
it. They had 3,000 copies printed, but gave
me to understand that they did not really
expect them all to be sold. In the event, sales
of Atoms of Silence have just topped 500,000
copies. This was a revelation to me as well as
my pubhshers. It showed that a vast pubhc
was interested in these questions and wanted
information about them which was rigor¬
ously scientific without lacking the freshness
and directness of a poetic approach.
Isn't something more than poetry in¬
volved in this mass phenomenon^ Isn't it
something to do with the mystery of cre¬
ation, in short with the religious sense?
Yes, I think it is. Nowadays, people want
to know much more than how things work.
Knowledge alone is not enough. More and
more people are wondering about the ulti¬
mate meaning of the universe.
All through the nineteenth century and
until the middle of the twentieth, there was a
tendency for people to put their trust in
science as a panacea. During the Second
World War, and especially with the threat of a
nuclear holocaust, people began to have
doubts, to live in a climate of insecurity and
feel anxious about the future. Science had
been instrumental in solving many serious
problems, but it had created others, and some
of the uses of scientific progress had given
rise to terrible threats. This meant that science
in itself was not exclusively beneficial, that its
development and applications needed to be
carefully monitored. Other beacons would be
needed to help us find our bearings, although
of course we should not lose sight of the sign¬
posts provided by scientific knowledge. To
my mind this is why there is such tremen¬
dous interest in astronomy, which seems to
come closest to the origins of the great mys¬
tery of existence, to those areas where physics
seems almost to merge into metaphysics.

<![CDATA[
what you say is very true. A few years
ago a friend of ours was extremely upset
because he had read somewhere that the Big
Bang theory had been called into question.
By being deprived of the certainty of the Big
Bang, he felt he had been robbed of an ex¬
tremely reassuring idea a discovery that
reconciled science with Genesis.
That's the kind of thing people sometimes
feel, although I would not go quite so far
myself.
The question you ask is how far the evo¬
lution of the universe is due to necessity and
how far to chance.
That's right. Until the nineteenth century,
roughly speaking, physics was extremely
deterministic in its approach: everything
fitted together, the same causes always pro¬
duced the same effects, and evolution was
governed by implacable laws. Then, from
Darwin onwards, the element of chance
came gatecrashing into scientific thinking,
and concepts like adaptation, mutation and
the survival of the fittest introduced a
random dimension. This opened up a tre¬
mendous debate.
Nowadays, we tend to think that neces¬
sity and chance are indissociable. The laws of
physics, for example, cannot be contravened,
but they apply in a given field of determina¬
tion. Outside that field, they cease to apply.
At the same time, events are taking place in
the universe, in other words there are new
and unpredictable occurrences that can be
explained by an unprecedented combination
of factors. I prefer to use the word "play"
rather than "chance" to describe what hap¬
pens. The way in which the laws are meshed
together is such that there is bound to be
some margin of play. To put it differendy,
without playing on words, the random ele¬
ment is necessary in nature. This was
demonstrated a long time ago in quantum
physics, with Heisenberg's uncertainty prin¬
ciple, and it has just been demonstrated again
on a broader scale with deterministic chaos
theories.
Let's take a simple example. At the pre¬
sent time, there are five billion human beings
on Earth, all subject to the same physical
laws, and yet all different from one another.
The fact that we each have our own persona-
Hty, history and destiny clearly shows that
the laws of nature, no matter how constrict¬
ing they may be, allow ample scope for
play, for the unpredictable, in short for
freedom.
Another example is that of snow crys¬
tals. When we look at them under the micro¬
scope, we see that they are all six-pointed.
This is the law: if they do not have six
points, they are not snow crystals. But when
we look at them more closely we see that
although they all have six points, they are
different. Magnificent books have been pro¬
duced containing nothing but pictures of
snow crystals, which are so beautiful precisely
because they have an identical structure but
an infinitely modulated pattern. When it
comes to people, just as in the case of snow
crystals or butterflies, nature is concerned
with two things: on the one hand, it orga¬
nizes things, lays down laws and establishes
order; on the other, it breaks the deadly
monotony of order by introducing flaws and
leaving room for uncertainty and indetermi¬
nacy, in other words diversity.
Do you mean that evolution could have
taken a different course from the one it hasf
Yes, but only up to a point. This possibi¬
lity exists within the margin of uncertainty.
However, the element of necessity dictates
some of the broad directions taken by evolu¬
tion. If you take a galaxy, for instance, there
is an evolutionary line that leads to the for¬
mation of stars. This is the extent to which
determinism is involved. However, it is
impossible to predict the birth of the specific
and unique star that we know as the Sun.
The Sun might well not have existed. This is
where the random element comes in.
In the same way, the Earth, with all its
very specific features, might well have not
come into being at all. However, given that it
does exist and given all the conditions
involved in its creation, it would perhaps
have been possible to predict the appearance
of life on it, but certainly not to predict that
there would be some forms of life rather
than others, that there would be elephants,
for example, rather than kangaroos. Again,
given the existence of the human species, it
would have been possible to predict or at
least to hope that humans would continue
to exist until now. But nobody could have
predicted that the three of us would be born
and that we would be sitting here together
today.
It is true that nobody could have made
such a prediction. But isn't this because our
system of knowledge, our technical equip¬
ment, and our ability to master all the rele¬
vant data are inadequate? Or is this some¬
thing that is objectively impossible, a sort of
built-in resistance of reality because reality
includes the unpredictable?
Reality includes the unpredictable and
random element. This is at the very heart of
chaos theories.
Is this an extension of the uncertainty
principle?
The uncertainty principle deals with the
infinitely small. Indeed, after this principle
had come to light and had been accepted by
the scientific community, it was long
thought to apply only on the scale of the
atom. On a larger scale there was no prob¬
lem: we had cast-iron laws. And then, all of
a sudden, it was realized that even the orbits
of planets could be chaotic under certain
]]>

<![CDATA[
conditions. For example, one of Jupiter's
satellites follows so strange an orbit that
nobody can predict what its direction will be
to within three days. This may sound amaz¬
ing to you, but it is a fact. You may have
every conceivable kind of data on its past
trajectory and a whole array of computers to
help you, but you cannot predict, here and
now, what its trajectory will be in three days'
time. It is not that our instruments are inade¬
quate for the purpose. It is because, in a
manner of speaking, the satelhte itself does
not know.
So chaos theory has put an end to sim¬
plistic determinism, which dominated both
scientific and philosophical thinking for cen¬
turies. By the same token, the theory has
given a solid boost to the idea of freedom. In
the past, people said you may think you have
a choice, but it's really only an optical illu¬
sion, everything is decided beforehand. Now
it's different, and even physics demonstrates
the contrary. We can now cast out all our
doubts and cry "Long live freedom!"
Now that you have reassured us about the
element of freedom we enjoy, let's get back
to the pattern which, somewhere between
necessity and chaos, defines the actual logic
of evolution, the pattern you call the
pyramid ofcomplexity.
I use the image of the pyramid by analogy
with that of written language. The logic of
written language is pyramid-like: it uses
several letters to form a word, several words
to form a sentence, several sentences to form
a paragraph, several paragraphs to form a
chapter, and several chapters to form a book.
It proceeds from the most elementary to the
most complex, from the most numerous to
the least numerous.
Evolution proceeds in the same way. It
creates a particle and then takes several par¬
ticles to make an atomic nucleus and so on
an atom, a molecule, a star, a planet, a cell, an
organism. The Big Bang could be said to be
the primeval explosion that produced the let¬
ters of the cosmic alphabet. From that point
onwards, we can date each stage of the
pyramid of complexity over the past fifteen
billion years.
There has been a great deal of debate
recently about the last fifteen billion years.
Perhaps it would be more interesting to ask
you about the next fifteen billion years. Or,
more seriously, at this point in time, what
can wepredict will happen?
There are two main opposing arguments.
We know that since the universe was created
it has been tending to cool down, and hence
to thin out and expand. The galaxies are
moving farther and farther apart. This is
going to continue for quite some time to
come, say for another forty billion years.
Everybody is agreed on this. Where opi¬
nions differ is on what is liable to happen
after that. Will the universe go on cooling
down and rarefying, or will it start heating
up again, with the galaxies coming closer
together again? In order to resolve this awe¬
some question, we need a mass of facts that
have not so far been very clearly established.
For the moment, however, there is a body of
evidence that suggests that the temperature
of the universe will continue to fall. But this
evidence is inconclusive. It is equally pos¬
sible to maintain the contrary.
What about the theory of thermal equili¬
brium?
Well, it had a considerable influence on
scientific thinking in the first half of this cen¬
tury, but fortunately it has now been super¬
seded. The theory arose out of discoveries
made in thermodynamics. It can be summa¬
rized by imagining what happens when you
put an ice cube in a glass 'of whisky. After a
short while, the ice melts and the whisky
gets cooler When you started, you had two
different temperatures, but at the end you
have only one, because the two temperatures
have come into balance. This was considered
a law of nature and it was applied to cosmic
evolution. Broadly speaking, what people
said was that at the beginning there were hot
bodies stars and cold bodies planets.
The conclusion they came to was that, with
the course of time, the temperature differen--
rials would diminish and would then cancel
each other out. However, when everything is
at the same temperature, nothing can
happen. This is what was called thermal
death. At the end of the last century, it was
predicted that the universe was inescapably
moving towards thermal equilibrium, and
hence to its death.
You can imagine the reactions that this
belief triggered off, even outside scientific
circles. William James said, in so many words,
that there was no longer any need to be
concerned about the future and to try and
improve things, since in the end there was
only nothingness. Lévi-Strauss took up the
same idea and even stressed the fact that the
]]>

more we laboured and exerted ourselves, the
greater the disorder and ultimately the
entropy. In other words, we were bound to
hasten thermal death through our own efforts.
Has anyone found an antidote to thermal
death?
Yes. On the scale of galaxies and stars, the
tendency towards thermal equilibrium has
not been borne out. In fact, the opposite has
been observed: over the past fifteen bilHon
years, evolution has been accompanied by an
increase in temperature differentials. Right at
the beginning, in the very first moments of
the Big Bang, the temperature of the uni¬
verse was constant. Then temperature differ¬
entials gradually started to occur. Had there
been any likelihood of thermal death, it
would have been in the past, not in the
future!
How do you account for such a mistake?
People were unaware of the importance of
gravity. The effect of the force of gravity is
not to reduce temperature differentials but
rather to increase them. In your glass of
whisky, the force of gravity is minute and
can be disregarded. But it is a quite different
matter on the scale of galaxies. As you can
see, that changes everything. From the philo¬
sophical standpoint, for example, it allows
people to take a hopeful view of things and
have a vision of the future in which effort is
meaningful and the struggle for a better
world is fully justified.
Where does natural evolution fit into this
vision of the future? Will the pyramid of
complexity suddenly stop growing? If not, is
the human species, in turn, going to make
way, in two or three million years' time, for
something more complex and sophisticated?
This is an assumption that obviously
cannot be ruled out a priori The pace of
change is constantly speeding up. The first
cells emerged four billion years ago and the
first living organisms 500 million years ago.
The human brain is less than two million
years old. Since then, it has tripled in size. In
the space of two million years, it has grown
from 500 to l,400g. You ask where do we go
from here. Things can continue to evolve.
but we don't know towards what. We are
completely in the dark.
As the brain continues to develop, is it
conceivable that human beings may become
nothing but walking brains in the next two
million years?
You have to remember that the brain
needs a body to perform all sorts of vital
functions. But this is an area where the wild¬
est flights of fancy are possible.
Let's leave the distant future to our dis¬
tant offspring and ask instead whether the
planet will still be inhabitable, aplace where
human beings can live, in a hundred or two
hundred years ' time?
There are a number of immediate threats
and the world is starting to become aware of
them. The UNESCO Courier has this year
published a large number of articles on the
problems of the environment, population
pressures, and so on.
Do you share the view of some scientists
that the continual growth of the world's
population is the greatest threat ofall?
It is a great danger. But I would not say
that it is the great danger. Let me explain.
The greatest threat comes from the amount
of carbon dioxide discharged into the atmos¬
phere, but the main culprit is not the popula¬
tion of the Third World, although it is the
largest in terms of numbers, but the popula¬
tion of a number of the most affluent and
industrialized countries. Some 10 per cent of
humanity is responsible for more than 80 per
cent of the carbon dioxide emitted into the
atmosphere. The main danger lies not so
much in numbers as in social and political
factors, in the very unequal distribution of
wealth in the world.
How would a more balanced distribution
ofwealth reduce the carbon dioxide hazard?
There are now five billion of us on Earth.
In the year 2050, the figure will have risen to
twelve billion, or perhaps even fifteen bil¬
lion. The question is whether we can provide
those fifteen billion people with a decent
standard of living that is also compatible
with the ecological balance, in other words
with the health of the planet. This decent
standard of living will obviously be much
higher than that of the Third World at pre¬
sent, but it is also bound to be lower than
that which the richest countries now enjoy.
We in the North will have to stop wasting so
much energy and get accustomed to being
more frugal.
Let's suppose that wealth has been equi¬
tably redistributed. People will have found
grounds for solidarity and justice and
become reconciled with one another. Yet will
they necessarily have laid the foundations of
a pact reconciling humankind with the bio¬
sphere? Such a pact will certainly not come
about automatically. A fairer distribution of
wealth is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition for that. A tremendous worldwide
mobilization of skills, talents and energies
will be needed, and many of the resources of
science and technology will have to be called
on. Compared with this exercise, the
resources that were mobilized to build the
atom bomb in the 1940s or to put a man on
the Moon in the 1960s were no more than a
drop in the ocean. This is the major problem
that humankind will have to face in the next
century. And that is why it is so urgent to
resolve the political, economic and ethnic,
conflicts that are still tearing humanity apart,
to cease squandering the forces and consum¬
ing the energy that it so badly needs to
commit to the general struggle for survival.

You look upon it as a struggle for sur¬
vival?
What will happen if we in the industrial
countries continue, as we are doing now, to
generate heat for our industries, our cars, our
household amenities and so on? We shall
discharge more and more carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere. That gas will continue
to raise the Earth's temperature until it
reaches the critical threshold, beyond which
it will no longer be possible for life to repro¬
duce. I really am talking about a struggle for
survival.
Do you think that international bodies
should be strengthened to cope with this
situation?
We shall certainly need international deci¬
sion-making bodies with more clout than
today. Some means or other will have to be
found to ensure that the overriding interests
of humanity are expressed and heeded, and
eventually given precedence over selfishness.
Failing that, the problems we are talking
about will not be solved. People are, to some
extent, coming to be aware of the need for
this. But we also have to avoid the dangers of
a sort of world government or power
without any checks and balances, which
could very soon turn out to be overmighty.
A balance has to be struck somewhere, but
unfortunately I have no idea how.
What a pity. There is one last question
that takes us far, far away from our Earth-
bound problems. To go back to the pyramid
of complexity, we have seen that the exis¬
tence ofprimary particles eventually led to
the development of the human brain. This is
what happened on Earth, a planet that fulfils
a number of specific conditions and is
situated at a certain distance from the Sun. Is
it not possible that this particular configura¬
tion, which has enabled life and sub¬
sequently human consciousness to emerge,
may also have occurred somewhere else? Is it
not plausible that there have been or are
other civilizations in the billions of other
existing galaxies?
The first answer is that we don't know.
We have not picked up any messages. We
have no proof. But that does not stop us spec¬
ulating. And it is true that there are several
reasons to believe that many extra-terrestrial
civihzations do indeed exist.
The main reason is that there is a good
chance of the conditions responsible for the
emergence of life and the human species on
Earth being reproduced or having been
reproduced long ago somewhere else. The
conditions required are a planet and a bio¬
sphere where the temperature is neither too
high nor too low, so that water exists in its
liquid state. There is a general feeling that
water in its liquid state is essential. If the
temperature is too high, water evaporates, as
on Venus and Mercury, and if it is too low,
water freezes, as on Mars. Only the Earth is
situated at the right distance from the Sun,
and therefore has a range of temperatures
that enables water to exist in both liquid and
gaseous states. That is apparently what is
needed for life to develop. Now there is
nothing particularly exceptional about that.
Of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy
alone not to speak of other galaxies there
must be two billion or so that are similar to
the Sun. If they are orbited by planets and
there is no reason to believe they are not
there must surely be millions, or even hun¬
dreds of millions of planets, where conditions
are like those on Earth. We can conclude that
there may be a large number perhaps even a
very large number of inhabited planets, on
which life may have currendy reached very
different stages. The more recent planets may
have reached the point where they have
something akin to the blue-green algae that
lived in our primal ocean or to the dinosaurs
that walked the Earth some 200 million years
ago. Planets older than our own may have
reached a more highly developed stage than
ours. Here again, one can give free rein to
one's poetic imagination.

LTHOUGH more logical, if more humdrum, explanations hove been
propounded to explain why human beings first stood on their hind legs, it
is a pleasing conjecture that then, as now, they were reaching for the
However this may be, even the earliest human societies looked to the stars
in their attempts to explain the origin and the nature of the universe. Almost all
the natural phenomena that dominated their lives appeared to emanate from
the heavens. The wind, rain and snows, the thunder and lightning and the
storms that threatened their survival, the Sun which ripened the fruit they
gathered or parched the Earth and laid it waste all these were clearly
manifestations of inexplicable higher powers that were in turn benevolent and
malicious. These powers appear to hove given human beings one gift to
compensate for their comparative lack of the instincts that guide other
animals that hallmark of humanity, the gift of curiosity
Generations of strivings have brought us much closer to an understonding of
the origins and nature of the universe.
On 23 April last year it was onnounced that the NASA satellite COBE (Cosmic
Background Explorer) had confirmed the Big Bang theory of the origin of the
universe by discovering ripples in the radiation from the fireball of creation.
In developing the Big Bang theory, astronomers hod to turn for help to
particle physicists. Astronomers are mainly concerned with trying to understand
the large-scale structure of the universe and are accustomed to thinking in terms
of light years'; particle physicists, on the other hand, ore concerned with the
structure of matter and the fundamental lows of nature at very small distances'.
Thus the first fractions of a second of the birth of the universe have become the
point of encounter of the infinitely great and the infinitesimally small.
This is 0 supreme example of the working method of the human mind, which
in all spheres has a propensity to work from the particular to the universal.
The same principle con be seen at work in the adventure of space
exploration. Satellites in their hundreds circle the globe, sending bock data on
everything from ocean currents and wove formations to crop prospects,
deforestation, sources of fresh water and mineral deposits. For the very first
time we hove at our disposal o synoptic view of the world we inhabit.
But knowledge con be destructive as well as constructive; it can both serve
and alienate humanity, protect nature as well as ploy havoc with it. It was long
thought that space was exempt from these contradictions, that it was too vast to
be in any way affected by human action. We ore now beginning to realize that
this is not the case.
Since the launching of the first Sputnik in 1957, one new satellite, on
average, has been launched every two or three days, the vast majority of them
being communication satellites of one kind or another Quietly almost
imperceptibly we hove witnessed the dawning of the "Communication Age". At
the same time, the first threats hove begun to appear.
The most obvious threat comes from the vast amount of debris from spent
satellites, the upper stages of rocket launchers and other sundry bric-à-brac of
space exploration, it has been estimated that tens of thousands of objects small
but capable of damaging a spacecraft are now in orbit round the Earth.
Equally serious is the threat to both optical and radio ostronomy resulting
from the ever-increasing amounts of light emonating from our big cities and
radio interference from communication satellites and ground sources of all
kinds.
Astronomers' growing colls for the preservation of "wilderness areas" in the
radio spectrum and light restricted zones for the preservation of the night sky
must be heeded if we are to probe further into the mysteries of space.
After gazing skywards for so long, humankind is now setting out to conquer
space. Shall we be capable of learning from the mistakes we hove mode in our
own little world, so thot we con explore the infinities of space with serenity?

when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 ,
the first artificial object to orbit the Earth.
This pioneering satellite did little more than
broadcast "bleep-bleep" signals, but it blazed
the trail to Earth-orbit. Since then, over 4,000
satellites have been launched. They carry out an
enormous range of tasks. Some survey the
Earth, for prospecting, weather-forecasting, or
military surveillance, others look into space
with specialized telescopes. Many satellites
transmit telephone and television signals
around the world, while a smaller number pro¬
vide precise signals for navigation. Among the
largest are the satellites that carry people: the
space stations and the craft that ferry astronauts
up to space and back.
These satellites are put into a variety of dif¬
ferent orbits, to suit their various functions.
The easiest orbit to reach is one that is closest
to the Earth, and takes the satellite more or less
around the equator in a direction from west to
east. The lower the orbit, the less energy is
required to reach it. And, when a satellite is
launched towards the east, it has the advantage
of starting off with some extra speed, due to the
Earth's west-east rotation.
LOW EARTH ORBIT
SATELLITES
Because they are so massive, crewed spacecraft
are almost always put into a "low Earth orbit"
of this kind. The American Space Shuttle flies
at an altitude of about 250 kilometres, while the
Soviet Mir space station is 100 kilometres
higher. Very massive uncrewed spacecraft
follow similar orbits. Among them is the
Hubble Space Telescope, which studies light
from the most distant objects in the universe
free from the blurring effect of the Earth's
atmosphere. Although its main mirror is unfor¬
tunately defective, the space telescope is indeed
returning pictures much sharper than any
ground-based telescope can achieve.
Although it is easy to reach low Earth orbit,
there is one serious problem. The Earth's
atmosphere does not stop abruptly at an alti¬
tude of 200 kilometres, where we loosely say
"space begins". Tenuous gases extend to much
greater altitudes, becoming more and more
rarefied with height. So the Shuttle and Mir are
by Nigel Henbest
both ploughing through the outer vestiges of
the Earth's atmosphere. In the process, they
lose orbital energy, and gradually spiral down
towards the Earth.
In the case of the Space Shuttle, this does
not really matter because it is only up for a few
days. The cosmonauts on Mir must, however,
fare boosters from time to time to counter the
orbital decay. A spectacular casualty of atmos¬
pheric drag was the American space station
Skylab. It was launched into an orbit 435 kilo¬
metres high in 1973. Despite this relatively high
"low Earth orbit", only six years later Skylab
at that time without a crew had spiralled so
near to the Earth that it burnt up in the lower
atmosphere, scattering pieces of hot debris over
Western Australia.
One type of satellite regularly dices with
death by flying very low orbits. These are on
"military reconnaissance missions": m other
words, they are spy satellites. They typically fly
in elliptical orbits with a low point 200 kilo¬
metres or less above the ground, and only last
for a few months. From this comparatively low
altitude, the film or television cameras on board
can make out details onlv a couple of metres
across: good enough to distinguish the type of
plane on an enemy airfield. Spy satellites arc
launched into orbits that go north-south,
almost over the poles of the Earth. From such a
"polar orbit", a satellite can survey the whole
of the world as it rotates below.
Polar orbits are also useful for other satel¬
lites that survey the Earth in particular, Earth
resources satellites. The pioneer in this field
was the American Landsat 1, launched in 1972.
Its cameras and infrared sensors immediately
proved their worth in monitoring crops,
forests, natural disasters (such as locust
plagues) and areas of pollution. They also let
geologists prospect in remote areas, by show¬
ing up geological structures that might contain
useful resources, such as oil, minerals or, in a
desert area, that most valuable of commodities,
water.
The continuing Landsat scries has been
joined by the French SPOT satellites, which
can see even finer details. To avoid atmospheric
drag, they orbit respectively 700 and 800 kilo¬
metres above the Earth. SPOT's advanced
cameras can show up individual houses below.

as they scan a strip 117 kilometres wide. In
twenty-six days, these narrow strips cover the
whole Earth.
Earth-observation satellites can use two
types of sensor. The simpler are passive sen¬
sors, which simply pick up radiation coming
from the Earth. Light is one of these radiations,
but more useful is infrared. Different kinds of
vegetation and rocks reflect infrared in differ¬
ent proportions, and as a result Landsat has
achieved great success in, for example, picking
out regions of diseased crops in otherwise
healthy farmland, and distinguishing rocks that
are likely to contain different kinds of minerals.
Some satellites carry active sensors. These
emit radio waves, generally at short wave¬
lengths, and study the way in which they arc
reflected by the Earth's surface. Simple radar

can reveal the shape of the ground below, and
even structures hidden below desert sand. In
1978, the American sateUite Seasat used active
sensors to study the surface of the ocean: they
revealed not only waves, but also ocean cur¬
rents and ripples that revealed the direction of
the wind blowing over the oceans. The Euro¬
pean ERS 1 satellite is now following up obser¬
vations of the land and sea in unprecedented
detail, using both passive and active sensors.
Also following polar orbits are satellites
designed to survey the sky: they simply point
in the opposite direction, always away from the
Earth. These satellites look at radiation from
space that cannot penetrate the atmosphere to
reach telescopes at sea-level. Amongst the most
successful were the Infrared Astronomical
Satellite, which found half a million new stars 11

and galaxies in 1983, and the Cosmic Back¬
ground Explorer (COBE), which in 1992
located ripples in gases expanding from the ori¬
ginal Big Bang.
THE HIGH-FLYERS
Satellites used for navigation have to be seen
over wide areas of the Earth, so they are put
into rather high orbits. The twenty-four
Navstar satellites that make up the Global Posi¬
tioning System are in circular orbits at an alti¬
tude of 20,200 kilometres, tilted at 55 degrees to
the Earth's equator. From any place on the
Earth's surface, at any time, three or more of
the satellites are above the horizon. Using
signals from the satellites, a receiver can auto¬
matically work out its location to 30 metres or
better. This system is intended for both civilian
and military use: it has been an invaluable aid to
everyone from solitary yachtsmen to the troops
involved in the featureless deserts where the
Gulf War was fought in 1991.
In the 1960s, the Soviet Union started a pro¬
gramme of communications satellites that also
moved in large, inclined orbits. Instead of follow¬
ing circular paths, however, the Molniya
satellites pursue long thin oval orbits. At its
closest (perigee), a Molniya skims just 500 kilo¬
metres above the Earth's surface. But it then
travels out to a high point (.apogee) some 40,000
kilometres above the Soviet Union. Here, the
satellite moves so slowly that ground stations
can keep it in view for several hours.
The time that it takes for a satellite to com¬
plete one orbit depends on just one factor: its
average distance from the Earth. The more dis¬
tant the satellite, the longer its orbital period.
The Space Shuttle and Mir and everything
else in low Earth orbit have an orbital period
of 90 minutes. The Navstars and Molniyas arc
both at an average distance of 20,200 kilometres
from the Earth, and both types have an orbital
period of twelve hours.

AN AERIAL MAST
36,000 KILOMETRES HIGH
For a satellite at a height of 35,880 kilometres,
the period is twenty-four hours. If it is follow¬
ing a circular orbit above the equator, the
satellite is moving at exactly the same rate as
the globe below is turning. As a result, the
satellite appears to hover exactly above the
same point on the equator.
The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke
pointed out, as early as 1945, that a satellite in
this "geostationary orbit" would be in an ideal
position to relay radio signals around the
world. It is effectively on top of a mast 36,000
kilometres high, and is visible from almost half
the Earth. Clarke realized that three satellites,
at equally spaced intervals around this orbit,
could send signals from any point on Earth to
any other.
Routing of intercontinental phone calls and
television broadcasts by satellites is now rou¬
tine. In fact, there is so much demand that the
geostationary orbit contains not three but
several dozen communications satellites. These
pick up a signal from a transmitter on one
continent, amplify it, and then transmit it down
to a large receiving aerial somewhere else in the
world.
Recent years have seen another kind of
transmission from satellites in geostationary
orbit colloquially known as "satellite televi¬
sion". A direct-broadcasting satellite also
receives a signal from the ground, and sends it

back to Earth. In this case, however, the satel¬
lite transmits the signal at such a high power
that it can be picked up by a small "satellite
dish" connected to a television set. The trans¬
mitters on the satellite are designed so that they
cover just a limited part of the Earth's surface;
only receivers within this "footprint" can
receive the television programmes.
Also strung around this imaginary circle
high above the equator are satellites that need
to view the Earth as a whole. These include
military satellites that eavesdrop on electronic
communications in other countries and look
for spots of infrared (heat) radiation from the
launch of missiles. Half a dozen meteorology
satellites in geostationary orbit, such as the
European Meteosat, keep an eye on the weath¬
er all over the FJ,arth. The continuous global
coverage from these satellites complements the
close-up views from weather satellites in low
polar orbits, like the American Tiros series.
Geostationary satellites are too high to feel
any drag from the Earth's atmosphere, so their
orbits do not decay. This could become a
serious problem. Once a satellite has reached
the end of its active life and stops working,
because of something like an electrical fault, it
clogs up some of the limited space around the
geostationary orbit. To prevent this, satellite
controllers use a small rocket engine that
boosts an ageing satellite out of the geostatio¬
nary orbit.
Some spacecraft are sent even further from
our planet. The Apollo flights took crews as far
as the Moon: between 1969 and 1972, twelve
Apollo astronauts actually landed on the lunar
surface. Their missions took them on a figure-
of-eight path around the Earth and the Moon,
but they never left the Earth's gravitational pull
entirely.
PROBING 'DEEP SPACE'
Automatic spacecraft have travelled well
beyond the Moon, exploring what NASA calls
"deep space". Once it breaks free of the Earth's
gravity, a spacecraft is no longer a satellite of
our planet. It is usually termed a space probe.
Once away from our planet, the dominant
force is the Sun's gravity. Space probes are
effectively miniature planets, orbiting the Sun
just like the Earth or Jupiter. The main differ¬
ence IS that they follow very elongated paths
that allow them to travel from the Earth to
another planet, or in the case of the Giotto
probe in 1986 to intercept Flalley's comet.
Spacecraft have now flown past all the planets,
except Pluto, and they have even landed on
Venus and Mars. Four spacecraft are travelling
outwards at such a speed that they will even¬
tually break free of the Sun's gravity. Then, 13

All spacecraft whether satellites or space
probes need certain basic systems. The first is
stabilization. Left to itself, a spacecraft will
naturally tumble over and over in an erratic
way. The simplest way to stabilize a spacecraft
is to make it in the shape of a cyHnder, and set
it spinning around the axis of the cylinder. Like
a spinning gyroscope, the axis will always point
in the same direction.
Most of these spinning satellites carry a
camera or communications antenna that must
point in one direction, usually towards the
Earth or even a particular ground station. To
prevent those instruments from whirling
around with the spacecraft, they are put on a
platform that is driven by a motor to rotate at
exactly the opposite rate to the spacecraft as a
whole; as a result, the "despun" platform keeps
a constant attitude in space.
More complex spacecraft generally do not
spin. They keep in the correct orientation by a
system of "three-axis stabilization", which cor¬
rects for unwanted satellite motions in various
ways.
Most satellites use a combination of small
rocket thrusters, spinning reaction wheels
within the spacecraft and large electromagnets
that push against the Earth's magnetic field.
These devices can also turn the spacecraft to
point in different directions when required as,
for example, in the case of the Hubble Space
Telescope which has to turn to look at different
objects in the universe.
Also very basic is the power supply. Almost
all spacecraft derive their power from sunhght,
converted into electricity by an array of solar
cells. In the case of spin-stabilized satellites, the
solar cells cover the surface of the cylinder.
Three-axis stabilized spacecraft usually have
the solar cells on large flat panels extending
outwards from its body: these panels are folded
and rolled up when the satellite is launched,
and opened up when it reaches orbit.
Spacecraft carrying a crew need more power,
and they often carry fuel cells. Here, oxygen and
hydrogen gases are combined in such a way that
they release the energy of the reaction as electri¬
city and the resulting water is useful, too.
Small nuclear reactors are used for spy satelhtes
carrying power-hungry radar systems. This is a
dangerous practice, as satellites of this kind have
fallen back to Earth and scattered radioactive
debris. Space probes travelling to Jupiter and
beyond also carry small nuclear reactors,
because the sunlight there is too weak to
produce enough electricity from solar cells.
Satellite designers also have to bear in mind
that it costs money to send extra weight into
space: about $20,000 for every kilogram launch¬
ed to geostationary orbit. So they must keep
a satellite's mass low by using strong but light¬
weight materials, such as carbon fibre and tita¬
nium. The design must also keep the satellite's
systems at the correct temperature, even
though one side is baked by the Sun and the
other exposed to the cold of space.
THE NEXT TEN YEARS
The pattern now established in space is Hkely to
continue for at least the next decade. Communi¬
cations satellites and direct-broadcast satellites
will continue to grow in number and in power,
while the Earth-observation programme will
mushroom during the 1990s. Satellites from the
United States, Europe, Russia and Japan will
survey our planet and its atmosphere in detail, in
an ambitious international programme called
Mission to Planet Earth. As well as measuring
the Earth's natural state, they will check how
human activities are causing the greenhouse
effect and the holes in the ozone layer, and other
types of pollution.

development

High Altitude Range) Centre,
India's largest satellite

ANY people regard technology as an
esoteric luxury reserved for the rich,
I developed countries. Nothing could be
further from the truth. Space technology, for
example, can make an immense contribution to
development, as can be seen from its applica¬
tions in India.
Developing countries are short of many
things: capital, food, land, skilled human
power. To help them to make the best use of
the resources that they do have and to locate
new ones, few technologies can match the
speed and reliability of satellite remote sensing.
The view from space sometimes indicates
features not detectable from the ground. An
example from India is the use of remote sensing
to locate groundwater. Reeling after two years
of severe drought, the states of Gujarat and
Rajasthan in western India faced a serious short¬
age of drinking water, especially in rural areas.
As part of the National Drinking Water Mis¬
sion, images taken by the US Landsat and
India's IRS-IA satellites were combined with
other data to identify promising sites in the
vicinity of drought-stricken villages.
The results were astounding. Use of scien¬
tific source-finding techniques (including
remote sensing) took the success ratio (drilling
that yielded water) to 90 per cent compared to
about 45 per cent using conventional tech¬
niques. Remote sensing has since been used to
locate prospective groundwater sites within a
radius of 1.6 kilometres of all villages that face
water scarcity. It is also helping in the more
important area of "harvesting" water by pin¬
pointing the most appropriate location for

check-dams and percolation tanks. This will
help to recharge groundwater and also reduce
wasteful water and soil run-off.
Deforestation is becoming an increasingly
serious problem in many developing countries
faced with adverse, and worsening, land to
population ratios. Satellite remote sensing can
help to determine ob|ectively the extent of
forest cover and to monitor change. In India,
for example, it established that the forest cover
was substantially less than was being claimed
and drew attention to the urgent need for affor¬
estation. As a result of this and a satellite-
based survey which indicated that about 30 per
cent of the country's area was wasteland, India
launched a major wastelands development pro¬
gramme in 1985.
STORMWATCH FROM SPACE
Indian fishermen are also reaping the benefits
of remote sensing from satellites. By analysing
satellite-derived data on sea-surface tempera¬
tures and other information, it is possible to
predict areas where the fish catch will be richer.
Fishermen in India's coastal areas eagerly await
the broadcasts that guide them to the best
fishing grounds.
With equal interest, and some trepidation,
Indian fishermen look out for information
about storms. Today they arc among the bene¬
ficiaries of a disaster warning system that has
been set up, on an experimental basis, on the
cyclone-prone East coast. One hundred special
disaster-warning stations (DWS) have been
created and linked to a central station at Delhi
via satellite. News about impending storms or
cyclones is sent via satellite directlv from Delhi
to DWS receivers. A siren is automatically acti
vated in villages likely to be affected, followed
by an audio warning and instructions about
what action to take. This satellite-based system
has proved to be more reliable than conven¬
tional communications.
For fishermen at sea, an Emergency Loca¬
tion Beacon is already available and an indige¬
nous version is being designed in India. In case
of a shipwreck, this will send a signal to be
picked up by a number of satellites, which will
relay it to a ground station. This station will be
able to calculate the precise location from
where the signal originated, so that rescue
teams can be directed there. Thanks to space
technology, headlines like "100 Fishermen Mis¬
sing" may one day be a thing of the past.
WEATHER FORECASTING
FOR FARMERS
In India, as in most developing countries, agri¬
culture is still largely dependent on the rains,
and accurate forecasts arc of crucial importance
in agriculture-dependent economies. Space
technology has revolutionized weather fore¬
casting and is contributing to better understand¬
ing of the global climate. Satellites play a crucial
role in collecting the data that are required.
India's INSAT 1 relays meteorological data
from a hundred remote, unmanned stations to
the central processing facility. It also takes pic¬
tures of the cloud-cover every half hour and
transmits them to a central station. Data from
other satellites and from conventional sources
are also available. Cyclones and storms are
tracked, and warnings sent out. INSAT "weath¬
er photographs" taken from 35,000 kilometres
above the Earth arc now a daily staple on
Indian TV. To make his weather forecast, the

Development and Educational

farmer continues to gaze at the sky for rain
clouds, but he also scans the satellite weather
photograph on TV.
But how to get the TV picture whether it
is the weather forecast, a new agricultural prac¬
tice or some song-and-dance entertainment to
the farmer, the villager, living in remote and
inaccessible parts of the country? Here again,
in developing countries with poorly developed
communications infrastructure, the best and
sometimes the only solution seems to be
space technology. Satellite-delivered TV (either
redistributed by a transmitter or a cable system,
or received directly through a small parabolic
antenna) is now fairly commonplace. Yet, to
the isolated village community, the little
antenna pulling the signal from the distant
satellite is a wondrous creation that is at once a
textbook, a newspaper, an instruction manual
and a fun-film: an invisible link that binds them
to the rest of humanity. A satellite-based radio
and TV network not only provides tremendous
cover, it is also cost effective, quick and reliable.
The INSAT system, which links all the
radio and TV transmitters in the country and
also has high-power quasi-direct-broadcast
channels, is also providing critical support to
education (at primary, secondary and tertiary
levels, to adults and continuing education) and
to health care.
All communications satellites provide sub¬
stantial capacity for telephony. In India, satel¬
lite communication makes it possible for a
person in a remote area in the northeast or
from one of the islands in the Bay of Bengal to
call a relative or a friend in one of the cities in
India or even abroad. Satellite communication
has abolished the concept of distance. With this
technology, it is as quick, easy and cheap to
communicate with a distant metropolis as with
a neighbouring community. Nowhere does this
mean more than in a poor, isolated village in a
developing country.
Remote sensing is also being used in India
for a variety of other applications, including
monitoring water and atmospheric pollution;
estimating crop acreage and yields; snow-melt
studies that help to predict the water inflow
into the reservoirs of North India, enabling
appropriate decisions to be made about
hydroelectric power generation and release of
water for irrigation; mineral prospecting; moni¬
toring urban growth so as to help in town-
planning decisions; recommending the ideal
alignment for canals and highways; studying
wildlife habitats; identifying suitable sites for
inland and brackish water fisheries.
Information is a prized resource, and one
that has traditionally been scarce in developing
countries. Now, through remote-sensing
satellites, a country can regularly and cost-
effectively gather information on all its crucial
natural resources. Combining the many inputs
from remote sensing and from other sources,
an ambitious National Natural Resources
Management System has been set up in India.
Technological advances very often tend to
widen the gap between developed and develop¬
ing countries. Space technology, however, is an
exception. It can turn the very backwardness of
a developing country to advantage by helping it
to "leapfrog" from obsolete systems to the most
cost-effective space-based one, without having
to invest in all the intermediate stages.

Iñm in fait and Mon

fastinatîon
of the red planet

CROSS the gulf of space, minds that are
to ours as ours are to those of the beasts
I that perish, intellects vast and cruel and
unsympathetic, regarded this earth with
envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their
plans against us."
Thus did H.G. Wells sound the apocalyptic
note in his famous novel The War of the
Worlds, published in 1898. These vast and
unsympathetic intellects were Martians, prepar¬
ing to invade and subjugate the planet Earth.
For Mars, the red planet and the god of war,
was a dying planet, much older than the Earth.
Mars was 235 million kilometres from the Sun,
as compared with Earth's 150 million kilo¬
metres; consequently, it had received much less
heat and cooled more rapidly. For Wells, life
on Mars must have developed earlier than on
Earth and the inhabitants had progressed much
further in technology.
Wells had good support from astronomers
of the time. When, in 1876, Giovanni Schiapa-
relli had trained his telescope on Mars, he dis¬
tinguished numerous sinuous indentations on
the planet's surface, which he called "canali",
correctly translated as "channels". And such
channels could only have been made by flow¬
ing water.
Percival Lowell of Harvard went further in
his analysis of Mars. From his observations in
the clear dry desert air of Flagstaff, Arizona,
Lowell concluded that the "canah" were in fact
Martian "canals" that had been created to tap
frozen water in the Martian ice-caps and carry
it to the equator where the climate was warm¬
est and most suitable for life. Lowell's precise
map of the "canals" convinced many that there
was indeed intelligent life on Mars, capable of
such engineering feats.
There have always been those with a spirit of
adventure, eager to extend the frontiers of discov¬
ery and knowledge. They believed in Mars as
Columbus had believed in the gold and spices of
the Indies. And as Columbus had dared the vast
mystery of the mighty ocean, intrepid souls
were not daunted by the 56 million kilometres
separating Earth from Mars. They longed to
know that man was not alone in the Universe,
that indeed in our own planetary system might
be found other intelligent beings with whom
humans could communicate.

background, had bothered to get a few basic
facts correct, later writers voyaged into realms
of fantasy. Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of
Tarzan of the Apes, invented a world called
Barsoom, inhabited by five races: red, green,
white, yellow and black. The red race was the
highest and most like human beings. Into this
weird world came a chivalrous Virginian, John
Carter. He had reached Mars by sorcery from
an ancient witch found in an Arizona cave. The
witch knew an incantation, the recital of which,
with some cabalistic signs, sent Carter hurtling
though space to awake on Mars. Burroughs'
inventions had an enormous popularity. Appear¬
ing in 1917, A Princess of Mars was the first of a
lengthy series of Mars tales which would stir the
imagination of millions of readers.
A HALLOWE'EN VISITOR
FROM MARS
Just twenty-one years later, another Welles,
named Orson, demonstrated how Mars had
penetrated the human mind. Then twenty-
three, Welles produced for CBS a weekly radio
show, The Mercury Theater of the Air. On
Hallowe'en, 1938, Mercury featured a dramati¬
zation of The War of the Worlds.
Welles would do it in the form of a realistic
news broadcast from the scene of the action.
No one knew whether it would work; indeed,
right up to air time they were still fussing with
the script.
It worked all too well. After an initial
announcement of Mercury's dramatization, a
programme of dance music from the "Park
Plaza Hotel" in New York was offered. Nei¬
ther the dance band nor the hotel existed, but
that didn't concern the listeners. In the midst of
a tango came a special news flash.
The genius of Welles took over, for the
whole effect was in the timing. The first flash
simply announced that a great cylinder-shaped
object had fallen in New Jersey, near Princeton,
creating a huge hole in the ground. "And now
we return you to the Park Plaza and the music
of Rafe Racquelson."
A newsman rushed to the scene and began
alarming reports, which Welles picked up.
Emerging from the cylinder was a "big greyish
bulk, the size of a bear, that glistened like wet
leather." The horrifying monster had no chin
but a "peculiar V-shaped mouth that conti¬
nually trembled, dripping saliva" and "Gorgon
groups of tentacles like arms of an octopus."
Then the voice of Orson boomed in the role
of Professor Pierson of Princeton University,
informing listeners that this horrid creature
must be a visitor from Mars. Now came the
apparition of a great glittering robot, sweeping
the area with the Martian death-ray; everything
within its radius burst into flame. The action
built to a crescendo as other robots emerged
and began striding toward New York, causing
havoc and death. While Orson described the
panic in the streets, a real frenzy had erupted in
New York as thousands tried to escape the
Martians. Police sirens shrieked amid the tur¬
moil, but Orson went on relentlessly. Finally,
the CBS studio was invaded, not by a hundred-
foot Martian robot but by furious New York
police who ordered the plug pulled on the
broadcast.
During all this frantic commotion, no one
had the presence of mind to turn to another
radio station to find out if the news flashes
were real. It was the time of Munich; everyone
was on edge, expecting war at any moment. If
not the Nazis, why not the Martians?
As long ago as 1 908, Alfred Rüssel Wallace,
who shared with Darwin the honours of the

theory of evolution, had demonstrated the
inaccuracy of Lowell's concept of canals on
Mars, created by highly advanced beings. Wal¬
lace showed the mean temperature of Mars to
be well below the freezing point of water and
argued that the so-called canals must be natural
geological faults in the planet's surface. Yet
how many read Wallace as compared with the
millions fascinated by H.G. Wells, Edgar Rice
Burroughs and Ray Bradbury's Martian chro¬
nicles or with those who heard Orson's doom-
laden voice on Hallowe en.'
A HABITABLE PLANET?
It is also true that beside Wallace's flat negative
that Mars never was or could be habitable must
be weighed the views of highly regarded scien¬
tists like Carl Sagan, who hold that the deep
channels on Mars are ancient river-beds carved
out by free-flowing streams of water. Where
has all this water gone? It is probably locked up
in the polar ice and in permafrost underground.
Sagan has suggested that Mars, rather than
being permanently icebound, may go through
cycles in which great dust storms carrying
clouds of dust from the equator darken the
poles. More sunlight is absorbed, atmospheric
pressure rises and water is unlocked from the
ice caps. Absence of dust storms reverses the
process, which transpires over long ages.
Until 1971 and Mariner 9, the closest we
had ever got to Mars was 9,600 kilometres up
with Mariner 4. Mariner 9, however, orbited
Mars within 1,300 kilometres and took thou¬
sands of photographs, most with a resolution
to one kilometre. The photographs revealed a
Moonlike landscape of rocks and desert, with
astonishing volcanic peaks, one three times
higher than any peak on Earth.
The Mariner photos also confirmed the pre¬
sence of profound channels as well as a gigantic
canyon. Valles Marineris, 3,200 kilometres long
and 8 kilometres deep. Though the diameter of
Mars is only 6,780 kilometres, half that of
Earth, the land surface is equal to that of Earth.
Because of Mars's greater distance from the

Sun, the Martian year is 687 days, but the Mar¬
tian day is virtually the same as our day. Grav¬
ity is slightly more than one-third that on
Earth. A person weighing 72kg on Earth would
weigh about 27kg on Mars. The atmosphere is
only about 1 per cent as dense as Earth's and is
largely carbon with about 3 per cent of nitrogen.
Temperatures range dramatically from minus
105°C at the poles to 20°C mid-day at the
equator.
Mars would seem unsympathetic to any
kind of advanced life as we know it on Earth.
However, the success of Mariner 9 encouraged
the US National Aeronautics and Space Admi¬
nistration (NASA) to put landers on Mars to
test the soil and look for micro-organisms.
Viking 1 touched down on 20 July 1976,
exactly seven years after man had first walked
on the Moon. Viking 2 arrived forty-five days
later. The landing sites were chosen for their
relative smoothness, to avoid a crash, rather
than for any particular interest they might
have. Viking 1 was at the end of a canyon, in a
region named Chryse Planitia, while Viking 2
was 3,000 kilometres northeast in Cydonia.
The Viking probes took 50,000 photos of
Mars and analysed the soil, a mechanical arm
scooping up samples and depositing them in a
test chamber for chemical and biological
checks. No organic compounds or carbon-
based units were found. As life on Earth is
based on organisms containing carbon, this was
a disappointing result.
On the other hand, NASA had received
wonderful colour photos of the red planet,
close-ups that revealed a surface under the pink
sky not unlike that of southwest Arizona and
which might be made habitable, given the air
and water. Moreover, as Michael Collins, pilot
of the Apollo 1 1 module that orbited the Moon
while down below Neil Armstrong took his
"giant step for mankind", has pointed out, the
Vikings had explored only a very small area of
Mars. How much more might be accomplished
with a rover such as had been used on the
Moon.
The former Soviet Union had also entered
the Mars sweepstakes, but without success. In
1988, two probes, Phobos 1 and Phobos 2,
were launched from the Cosmodrome in Kaza¬
khstan, intended to orbit Mars' larger satellite,
take photos and land on Phobos. The first
probe went off course due to an error by
ground control, while the other had a failure of
communication as it orbited Phobos.
NASA's space programme has been delayed
by cost overruns and by the Challenger disaster
of February 1986 in which the Shuttle went
down in flames, with the deaths of six astro¬
nauts and one passenger. All Shuttle flights and
interplanetary explorations were postponed for
twenty-one months. However, on 25 Sep¬
tember 1992, an uncrewed probe, Mars
Observer, was launched by a Titan rocket from
Cape Canaveral for an eleven-month trip to

Mars. Operating from a polar orbit 390 kilo¬
metres up, during one Martian year (687 days).
Observer will map the entire surface of Mars
twelve times, with low resolution images for
study of ice-caps and sand dunes and a narrow-
angle camera showing details to a resolution of
1 .4 metres. The photos may provide evidence
of some form of primitive life, existing or fossil¬
ized, and may also explain what happened to all
the water that must have flowed on Mars a few
million years ago.
In the wake of Mars Observer, Russian
Proton rockets will launch in 1994 and
1996 two joint Russo-British missions to the
planet. While the two orbiters circle Mars, two
40-kg probes, designed at the University of
Kent (UK) and built under contract with the
European Space Agency, will plunge into the
surface. Penetrating up to 6 metres, they will
search for underground ice. The second mis¬
sion will lower a French helium balloon by
parachute to hover at 1,000 metres for close-
ups and weather reports. It will also carry a
small rover to explore the Martian wastelands.
Data obtained by these probes will be sent back
to Earth by a French relay system on Mars
Observer.
In 1996 as well, a Japanese spacecraft will
orbit Mars, examining the upper atmosphere.
For the first time in history, five nations will
co-operate in a planetary investigation a fore¬
runner of a crewed Mars mission in the twenty-
first century. Such a venture should involve
engineering skills of many countries.
Ultimately, humankind may colonize the
forbidding red planet and find a new home
under its pink skies. First we must "terraform"
Mars, as Arthur C. Clarke in his science-fiction
work The Sands of Mars proposes. Terraform-
ing Mars means conditioning the planet to
support human life, that is, by warming and
greening the place. Whether this is truly pos¬
sible, no one can now say. Was it possible for
Columbus to find a vast unknown land beyond
the horizon? Few in 1492 would have taken a
bet on it.

fay to fa

by Nikolai
Rukavislinil(ov
4 Russian (osmonaut ponders tbe future of
(rewed spate flight
22
ON 12 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin, a car¬
penter's son from the town of Gzhatsk,
near Moscow, became the first man to
travel beyond the confines of the Earth. Since
then, some 250 Earthlings have ventured into
space and some have even walked on the
Moon.
Among these space travellers were some
who regarded space as little more than an
extension of an Earth-based laboratory, differ¬
ing only in that in space there is no gravity.
Others, however, found that their perception
of space and time co-ordinates was fundamen¬
tally changed and that, following the space
experience, they had to go through a process of
serious psychological adaptation.
From the very first contact with my own
"personal cosmos" I was overwhelmed by the
unexpected contrast between our own bright,
relatively small planet and the dark infinity of
cosmic space. I was struck by the thought that
down there was where the whole history of
humanity had unfolded; down there were the
states, the frontiers, the wars, the friendships,
the love, in short, all that human life contains.
How infinitesimal it seemed in comparison
with the awesome majesty of space.
THE WEAKEST LINK
My encounter with space has convinced me
that, as compared with the technological sys¬
tems of the space vessel, the human being is the
weakest, most delicate element on a space
flight. In the aftermath of International Space
Year (1992) it seems appropriate to reflect upon
the part people have to play in the continuing
exploration of space. The question that needs
to be answered is: "Are crewed space flights a
good or a bad thing? On balance, does the crew
of a spacecraft serve any useful purpose?"
History will judge who is right in the
quarrel that has divided cosmonauts, scientists
and space experts into two camps the "cos-
mophiles" and the "tcrraphiles". The "cosmo-

philes" are convinced that the future lies in
"satellite cities", in which, by the middle of the
twenty-first century, half the world's popula¬
tion will be living. The "terraphiles", however,
are equally convinced that, for a whole series of
reasons, humanity will remain upon Earth for
ever and that crewed flight into space will
cease.
The argument is at two levels the techno¬
logical plane and what might be called the psy¬
chological and philosophical plane.
What are the technological considerations
that limit the possibility and the desirabihty of
humans living in space? The prime considera¬
tion, as has already been mentioned, is the psy¬
chological and physical weakness of human
beings as compared with the power and
strength of technology.
The technical systems of a space vehicle can,
for example, function normally in the presence
of wide variations in temperature, to which
humans are extremely vulnerable. To ensure

human survival, a stable temperature of around
20°C is essential. The space vehicle must there¬
fore be equipped with a complicated system
capable of maintaining a constant temperature.
Technical systems can operate in an atmos¬
phere consisting of inert gases, at a variety of
pressures, or even in a vacuum, whereas
humans have to be supplied with an Earth-type
atmosphere with a specific oxygen content and
the right proportion of carbon dioxide and
water vapour at an atmospheric pressure vir¬
tually identical with that on Earth. Generally
speaking, technical systems require only a
supply of electricity to keep them going
whereas humans have to be provided with
a varied supply of food. Furthermore, when
they are running, systems only give off heat,
whereas humans have to be provided with
waste disposal facilities.
Finally, technical systems can function
under a wide range of acceleration stress from
zero gravity to several times the gravitational
acceleration of a body falling near the Earth;
for humans, special protective measures are
necessary to avoid damage to the organism, or
even death.
THE COSMONAUTS' CODE
In spite of all the efforts made by the construc¬
tors of space vehicles to ensure their reliability
and the battery of tests to which spacecraft are
subjected, it is obvious that today there is a
great risk attached to any space flight. As we
know, not all crews return.
The risk factor is very well understood, not
least by those setting out on a space flight.
Before take-off, the notion of danger engenders
a feeling of uncertainty and a certain psycholo¬
gical tension.
Sergei Korolev, the man who built the first
Soviet missiles and spacecraft, was very aware
of this. I remember the advice he gave to those
of us destined to become cosmonauts. He
insisted that going on a space flight was a
purely voluntary matter and that if any of us
were to find that we could not overcome our

psychological fears and were no., convinced
that we would succeed, all we had to do was to
admit this quite openly, right up to the very last
moments before take-off, and refuse to go.
Anyone doing so would be replaced and the
flight would be postponed. There would be no
recriminations and no blame would be attached
to anyone who did so.
In effect, Korolev was laying the founda¬
tions of the "cosmonauts' code". He believed
that human beings came first and that the post¬
ponement of a space flight was a small price to
pay compared with the danger, during a flight,
of having a cosmonaut paralysed with fear and
unable to function properly. Fortunately, the
history of space flight has no record of any
such refusal.
Nevertheless, a speed-up in the pulse rate, a
sign of psychological tension, is observed in all
cosmonauts just before take-off. If the flight
proceeds normally and all the equipment func¬
tions normally, this tension decreases gra¬
dually. But what happens when an unexpected
incident puts the crew's lives in jeopardy?
Everybody remembers the American
Apollo 13 flight during which an explosion
occurred in the spacecraft as it was heading for
the Moon and the nerve-shattering drama that
was played out on board. We remember the
courage of the crew and the heroic work of the
Command Centre through whose efforts
disaster was avoided. The crew survived and
returned to Earth, but the psychological cost
was great for them, their families, the staff of
the Command Centre, and the millions of tele¬
vision viewers who followed the operation
from beginning to end.
MY BRUSH WITH DEATH
I personally experienced a similar drama in
1979, when I was given command of a Soviet-
Bulgarian space crew. Georgi Ivanov and I set
off aboard the Soyuz 33 transport spacecraft
with the objective of docking with the Salyut 6
orbital space station and carrying out a number
of research tasks over a period of several days.
The flight began normally with no sign of
anything untoward happening, but when we
were within about two kilometres of the space
station, as the main engine was started up so
that we could manoeuvre, we heard a loud
bang at the rear of the spacecraft, which shud¬
dered violently, lost stability and began tumb¬
ling uncontrollably.
I won't go into the technical details of what
had happened; suffice it to say that there was a
serious failure of the main engine. Not only did
this make docking with the space station
impossible, it also meant that there was little
likelihood that our spacecraft could return to
Earth.
Georgi and I thought that only a miracle
could save us and the miracle occurred. Per¬
haps it was all due to the skill of the staff at the
Command Centre and the reliability of the
reserve engine, yet neither of us could get rid of
the notion that supernatural forces had come to
our aid. Somehow, throughout the seventeen
hours during which we remained in waiting
orbit, we felt that there would be no miracle for
us. They were not, I can assure you, the most
agreeable seventeen hours of my life.
There are those who maintain that the risk
factor will be reduced in the future and who
deplore the cold, "soulless" aspect of crewless
space flights. Yet cosmonauts continue to lose
their lives and the cost in suffering for their
families is enormous; under the circumstances
crewless flights seem infinitely preferable. It is
by no means certain that the risks will disap¬
pear. It is extremely difficult to guard against
radiation and the danger from meteorites and
even more difficult to guard against the threat
from the powerful gravitational pull of possible
"black holes".
THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS
OF PHYSICS
Life in a state of weightlessness is life at the
limit of human endurance. There is a sensation
of having been projected into an anti-world, of
having stepped through the looking-glass of the
laws of physics. You feel as though you are
walking on your hands and that your blood is
stagnant in your veins.
Many cosmonauts have experienced the
"position illusion" when they have the
impression that they have their backs to the

IN the industrialized countries, 3.3 per cent of the adult
population is illiterate. For the developing countries as a
whole thefigure is 35 per cent, and rises as high as 60 per
cent in the 47 least developed countries. In the develop¬
ing countries, some 130 million children in the 6- to 11-
year age-group and 277 million in the 12- to 17-year
age-group are not enrolled in school. Throughout the world
there are 44 million teachers in the formal education sys¬
tem, and millions of other people working in various capa¬
cities who transmit their knowledge on an informal basis.
They all need the written word in order to share their know¬
ledge. Education and culture need books, magazines, and
newspapers.
Paper accounts for 30 to 50 per cent of the total cost of
publishing, and this percentage can be as high as 60 per
cent in countries where the paper industry is still in its
infancy. It is very difficult for paper users in the non-indus¬
trialized countries to obtain supplies, especially because of
the bewildering terminology used by specialists.
Many users in the South are askingfor assistance in order¬
ing "cultural" paper, the kind used for books and news¬
papers, which is usually imported, and in hewing it deliver¬
ed. Paper Users Clubs have been set up in Jamaica and the
Dominican Republic. Buying paper wholesale, in the form
of roll stock rather than sheets, can reduce costs. In
Tanzania, small and medium-sized printers and publishers
have joined together, with a view to collaborating and
increasing self-reliance. A Paper Users' Manual has been
published and publishers' practical training programmes
are being planned.
To promote literacy and the right to culture and defend a
certain idea of communication is to defend the cause of
paper.

World
Although the United States tooic
an early lead in wind technology,
the use of wind power there got
off to a shaky start in the 1980s.
After earning a reputation for
being an unreliable energy
source, wind is now making a
brisk comeback. Greatly improv¬
ed machines with highly effi¬
cient turbines are relatively
simple to operate and cheap to
use. Production costs per kilo
watt-hour are falling steadily. In
the United States wind power
already generates a total of 1,600
megawatts, or enough electricity
to meet the domestic needs of a
city like San Francisco. But the
most advanced development pro¬
grammes for this clean and re¬
newable energy source are to be
found in Europe, especially in
Germany, the Netherlands and
Denmark.
Although environmentalists are
stepping up their protests against
dams, and the Aswan High Dam
has been a special target of criti¬
cism, Asit K. Biswas, former
President of the International
Water Resources Association, has
come forward with a more posi¬
tive assessment of the Egyptian
26
dam. "The huge costs of building
the dam are estimated to have
been recovered within only two
years," he writes, "through
increases in agricultural produc¬
tion and hydropower generation.
The dam also proved its value to
the country's economy through
years of sustained drought and
potentially catastrophic floods.
Although there are environmental
problems resulting from the
dam's construction, many
including riverbed erosion and
the effects on fishing have
proved much less severe than at
first feared. Others, such as an
increase in waterborne diseases,
have been shown to be mainly
due to lack of sanitation."
According to Biswas, the High
Dam has made "significant bene¬
ficial contributions to Egypt's
overall development."
Between 1940 and 1990, popu¬
lation growth in the United States
was greater along the coastlines,
especially the AÜantic and Pacific
coasts, than elsewhere in the
country. In 1990, nearly half of all
Americans lived within 80 km of
the sea. Population growth is lead¬
ing to forms of development that
threaten wildlife and the ecologi¬
cal balance in these areas. The
same trends are also found
planetwide: 60 per cent of the
world's population today live
within 60 km of the sea. According
to a United Nations forecast, this
proportion will rise to three-quart¬
ers by the year 2000.
In his 1556 treatise on mining,
De Re Metallica, the German geo¬
logist Georgius Agrícola wrote:
"The fields are devastated by
mining operations	 Woods and
groves are cut down, for there is
need of an endless amount of
wood for timber, machines, and
the smelting of metals. And when
the woods and groves are felled,
then are exterminated the beasts
and birds. . . . Further, when the
ores are washed, the water which
has been used poisons the brooks
and streams, and either destroys
the fish or drives them away."
Today, four centuries later,
mining projects threaten nearly
half the national parks in tropical
countries. The smelting of ores
releases millions of tons of sul¬
phur dioxide and other pollutants
into the atmosphere each year. It
has created as many as 10,000
hectares of biological wasteland
and accounts for much of the
world's acid rain. Yet there is little
discussion of the impact of
mining on the environment. It
will not be easy to reduce indus¬
try's global appetite for minerals,
but this is clearly a problem that
will have to be closely watched.

Venezuela has the highest rate
of urbanization in South America
today. During the 1970s and
1980s, considerable numbers of
Venezuelans migrated to urban
areas, hoping to benefit from the
oil boom. Many of them ended up
in barrios, low-income squatter
settlements that sprang up on the
edge of the major cities. There are
twice as many barrios today as
there were in 1978. Barrio resi¬
dents are needy and have no legal
title to the land they occupy. A
$40 million World Bank loan has
been made to help FUNDACO-
MUN, the Venezuelan agency res-
ponsible for improving living
conditions in the barrios. A plan
for granting land ownership to
barrio residents will be launched
to give residents an incentive to
upgrade their homes.
A Friends of the Earth group
has been establi^shed in Lomé,
Togo. With the help of a French
nongovernmental organization,
Solidarité Forêt, its Togolese
members have undertaken a tree-
planting campaign. They have
planted plots of eucalyptus to
provide villages in the Kioto
region with firewood, and teak to
counter desertification. One nur¬
sery will produce 15,000 saplings
of a variety of species intended to
provide shade in streets, public
squares, and gardens.
Cameroon, a country often
considered to be a microcosm of
Africa because of the many types
of climate and soil that are found
there, is facing many environmen¬
tal problems, including desertifi¬
cation in the north, marine pollu¬
tion offshore in the south,
anarchic forest exploitation, and
random dumping of industrial and
domestic wastes. In April 1992, on
the occasion of the Earth Summit
in Rio, the government of
Cameroon decided to set up a
Ministry of the Environment and
Forests. A group of international
experts was asked to study the
situation and provide the new
minister with a general policy pro¬
posal. A multidisciplinary mission
visited Cameroon in September
1992 not only to make suggestions
but also to propose specific
actions and to develop the
contacts needed to secure funding
for them. This is an experiment
that will be fascinating to follow.

PAPER was invented in rela¬
tively recent times. Mediter¬
ranean civilizations used
papyrus reeds for more than
4,000 years. In his Natural
History, the Roman writer
Pliny the Elder described the pre¬
paration of the reed as follows:
"The paper is prepared by using a
needle to split the papyrus into
strips that are very thin but also as
wide as possible. The strips are
spread on a sloping table, dam¬
pened with Nile water, and then
crossed with other strips to form
a latticework pattern. These are

pressed to make a sheet which is
dried in the Sun." The last
recorded use ofpapyrus in Europe
was in 1057. It was replaced by
parchment made of animal skin,
which was expensive.
The first sheets of paper, a felt¬
like material made of matted cel¬
lulose fibres, were produced in
Canton, China, in 123 BC, when
Tsai Lun, the Minister of
Agriculture, recommended the
use ofmulberry bark and bamboo
to produce a pliable, polished
sheet. In 751, Chinese prisoners
captured in Samarkand by the
Arabs described these techniques
to their captors. In 794, paper
mills were set up in Baghdad, and
later in Damascus. Subsequently
others were established in
Alexandria, Tripoli, Tunis, Fez,
Valencia in Spain, Palermo in
Sicily, and Genoa, Siena and
Fabriano in Italy. Arab paper was
made of rags (mostly linen)
ground between two millstones.
For centuries, in Europe, "rag
was the indispensable raw mate¬
rial used in paper manufactur¬
ing," writes the historian Georges
Detersannes. "Its relative abun¬
dance, together writh that ofwater,
would be the key factor in decid¬
ing whether or not the art of
paper-making would be estab¬
lished in a particular region."
Throughout the eighteenth cen¬
tury, traders collected and sorted
rags, with white ones fetching
twice the price of black ones. Up
to that time, paper-makers also
spread out the sheets in meadows
to bleach them. From the second
half of the eighteenth century
onwards, chlorine was used as a
bleaching agent, later being mixed
with limewater. This chlorine
solution came into general use
and has been used ever since.
During the same period, rags were
replaced by wood.
Well-tended forests
"The paper industry is good for
the development and sound
management of forests," claims
Francis Cailliez, a specialist in
forestry research. All those who
think that making paper means
destroying trees will probably find
this a rather surprising statement.
"A magnificent forest is one that is
managed and carefully tended,"
says Cailliez. Trees need to be
felled when they have reached
maturity, so as to give the young
trees around them the opportu¬
nity to thrive. Thinning out dense
stands of forest provides timber
for joinery and construction work.
The upper part of trees and the
branches go for firewood or pulp,
uses for which diseased, small or
misshapen pieces of wood are
also very suitable. "The two main
threats to forests are natural disas¬
ters such as big fires, followed by
shifting agriculture and grazing.
Timber felUng comes a long way
behind," notes Cailliez, who has
spent twentyyears studying trop¬
ical forests. Forests are not threat¬
ened by the paper industry as
such, but by haphazard felling.
The world has three main forest
zones: in Amazonia, southeast
Asia, and central Africa. Examples
ofbadly controlled deforestation
are to be found in the first two
regions. The central African basin
has 500 million hectares of forest

Central African Republic, and

pulping process. rate of population growth is a
threat to the forest, not only
because people cut down trees
for firewood and clear the land
for farming, but also because of
overgrazing by the animals they
raise to survive. It is not surpris¬
ing, therefore, that the forest
should regenerate in a region that
has been abandoned by human
populations. This has happened
in the once-overpopulated coastal
savanna of Gabon, a region from
which human activity has now
virtually disappeared.
Forests in countries specializ¬
ing in the production of paper
pulp, such as Canada and the
Scandinavian countries, are very
well managed. The largest artifi¬
cial forest in Europe, the pine
forest that covers more than one
million hectares in the Landes
department in southwestern
France, suppUes wood to three
paper mills in the area. In an
endeavour to increase producti¬
vity, scientists are working on the
development of a type of pine
with optimum qualities, such as
straight and rapid growth without
too many branches, and resis¬
tance to drought, frost, disease.
insects and fungus. Some promi¬
sing results have been achieved. It
used to take sixty-five years to
grow a good tree. Soon it will take
no more than forty years. Between
1962 and 1987, the Landes forest
almost doubled its output from
an annual 4.7 cubic metres to 9
cubic metres per hectare.

"In plantation forestry," notes
Francis CaiUiez, "the conflict that
sometimes arises between the
defenders of local species and the
advocates of imported species
seems to have subsided. The pre¬
vailing opinion is that an unpre¬
cedented effort should be made
to establish more plantations, so as
to relieve the pressure on natural
formations, to store carbon, to
meet human needs for wood and
other forest products, and to pro¬
duce exportable commodities 	
Regardless of whether they are
used for firewood, construction
timber or wood pulp, exotic spe¬
cies (such as the much decried
eucalyptus varieties) seem to have
won acceptance." The eucalyptus,
which has adapted very well to
the savanna along the coast of
Congo, near Pointe Noire, reaches
maturity in seven years. The qual¬
ity of its fibre is highly suitable for
paper manufacturing, which is
why intensive eucalyptus planta¬
tion has been carried out in
Congo, Brazil and southeast Asia.
Research is also being carried out
on the production of paper from
straw.
Yet perhaps the simplest way
to manufacture paper is to make
it from paper itself. Europe pro¬
duced nearly 32 miUion tons of
pulp in 1991, while it consumed
about 25 million tons of waste
paper. Nearly 50 per cent of used
paper and newsprint is recycled.
A sheet of paper can be recycled
seven times. Satisfactory re¬
cycling, however, depends on the
quality of the sorting. Let users
take their waste paper to the
containers which are increasingly
being provided for that purpose in
cities, towns and villages. By doing
so they can help to prevent this
faithful ally of the written word
from being wasted.

After heavy
felling, a few
beleaguered
trees are left in
this badly eroded
area around
Kenya's Lake
Nakuru.
'ELLINGTON Ojuok, a sixty-
five-year-old farmer at
Maseno in the Kenya high¬
lands nodded at his unu¬
sual crops: long rows of
young green corn plants
alternating with rows of short,
bushy trees.
"This corn is doing better than
the corn without the trees, " he said.
"But it's a lot of work to cut the
branches. I want to see more results
before I plant trees in my other
fields." He gestured at the corn
growing on six hectares below his
compound of houses.
Within sight of Lake Victoria and
a stone's throw from the equator,
Ojuok and fifty-one other farmers in
his region began an agroforestry
project eighteen months ago to
improve their soils. They planted
rows of leguminous trees between
rows of corn. A special feature of
these trees is their capacity to "fix"
atmospheric nitrogen in the soil,
making this important nutrient
available to other plants.
Two or three times a year, the farm¬
ers cut the trees' leafy branches
and place them on the soil around
the com as "green manure" fertilizer.
The leaves release nitrogen to the
crop as well as other nutrients that the
trees capture deep in the soil. The
leaves also provide a high-protein
feed for livestock and the branches
make good fuel for cooking.
The experiments on Ojuok's farm,
and on dozens ofothers throughout
Africa, are part of an international
effort to discover and implement
agroforestry technologies combin¬
ing trees with crops and livestock

to Stop agricultural and environ¬
mental degradation.
Farmers in Kenya, as well as in
many other countries, face the
problem of depleted soils and
decreasing harvests. (Each year
more than 25 million tons of topsoil
disappear from the world's culti¬
vated fields.) In the past, Ojuok and
other farmers in western Kenya
used to have little problem with soil
fertility, because they had enough
land to fallow so the soil could rep¬
lenish itself and to raise cows that
provided manure to fertilize the
crops. But as the population
increased, farm sizes decreased.
"Now there's no land to fallow
and not enough to raise cows for
manure," said Eva Ohlsson, an agro¬
nomist with the Agroforestry
Research Station at Maseno, where
scientists from the International
Council for Research in Agroforestry
(ICRAF) work with colleagues from
the Kenya Agricultural and Forestry
Research Institutes.
Agroforestry emerged as an inte¬
gral part of modern agricultural
development in the 1970s when it
became clear that the Green
Revolution would not help many of
the world's poor farmers. Those
who could not afford pesticides, fer¬
tilizers and irrigation were still
doomed to eke out less and less
from their land. Agroforestry pro¬
mised to provide a sustainable
approach in which small farmers
could grow food, wood fuel and
building materials for themselves
and fodder for their animals.
After ICRAF was founded in 1973
in Nairobi, scientists travelled
through Africa, India, southeast Asia

Well-tended ^nd Latin America to find out what
farmland in the the farmers' problems were and the
Kisli highlands of solutions they had found that could
northwest be shared with farmers in other
Kenya. parts of the world. At the Maseno
field station promising trees from all
over the world were tested to deter¬
mine which ones grew best in the
area. A species originating in Mexico
and further developed in China was
particularly promising. The soil fer¬
tility improvement that resulted
in increased corn yields was so
dramatic that researchers decided
in 1990 to begin a four-year trial
with farmers, with funding from the
Rockefeller Foundation.
However, good results from
controUed experiments may not
always look the same when the
work is taken to the real world.
ICRAF researchers found that farm¬
ers, since they could not risk a
decrease in their crop yields, chose
thé worst land for their test plots.
Some branches were not cut often
enough because the women, who
do most of the farming, were over¬
burdened by the tasks of feeding
and caring for their families.
On Ojuok's farm, the cows don't
like the leaves. On other farms, one
of the most serious problems has
been that livestock and wild ani¬
mals are so eager to eat the leaves
that they wreck the experiment.
Although Ojuok's cattie are fussier,
he has noticed that the rows of trees
are controlling soil erosion.
But although agroforestry shows
great promise for reclaiming lands
starved ofnutrients and supporting
agriculture on a sustainable basis, it
is no panacea. The soils on Serfina
Ouko's farm, for example, are
severely damaged by erosion and
bad ploughing. "I'm not sure if this
approach will be enough," said Rob
Swinkels, an agricultural economist
with ICRAF, shaking his head as he
looked at knee-high corn that
should come up to his waist and
the yellowed leaves on the trees.
In Kenya, 16 million people on
small farms produce 60 to 70 per
cent of the country's food. Typical of
these farmers, Ojuok wants another
season or two to evaluate the pros
and cons of agroforestry. The
income from increased corn yields
and other benefits must balance
the land taken by the trees and the
extra effort required to cut their
branches. In the long term, what
hangs in the balance is the viability
of smaU-scale agriculture and a-
whole nation's food supply.

An Australian
Aboriginal tale

The story on this page appears in an
anthobgy entitled Compdignons du Soleil
("Companions oftile Sun") co-published (in
French) by Unesco, Editions La Découverte
(Paris) and the Fondation pour le progrès de
l'Homme. The anthology has been prepared
under the general editorship ofthe African
historian Joseph Ki-Zerbo, in collaboration with
Marie-Josephe Beaud.
FOR a long time, there was no Sun,
only a Moon and stars. This was
before there were men on Earth,
when there were only four-footed
animals and birds, which were seve¬
ral times bigger than they are today.
One day, Dinewan the emu and
Brälgah the Australian crane were
standing on a broad plain near the
river Murrumbidgee. They were
quarrelling and fighting. In a fit of
anger, Brälgah ran to Dinewan's
nest, seized one of the large eggs in it
and threw it as hard as he could into
the sky. It broke into pieces against a
pile offirewood, which burst into
flames when the yolk touched it The
flames lit up the Earthly world, to
the great astonishment of all the
living beings, which until then had
been accustomed to living in semi-
darkness and were blinded by the
sudden burst oflight.
A kindly spirit in the sky saw how
brilliant and beautiful the Earth
was when that flame flared up. It
thought that it would be a good
thing to make such a fire every day.
And that is what it has been doing
ever since. Every night, the spirit and
its helpers gather firewood, which
they build up into a pile. When the
pile is large enough, they send the
Morning Star to warn the beings on
Earth that thefire will soon be lit
When the spirits light the fire, it
does not give off much heat But by
midday, the whole pile is on fire and
the heat is terrific. Then it gradually
dies down, and when evening comes
only a few red embers are left, which
die out altogether, apart from some
which the spirits cover with clouds,
so that another fire can be lit on the
following day. Text @ Editions La

ceiling, or that their heads are facing down¬
wards. The first experience of weightlessness is
always disagreeable, but after a few days the
adaptation process becomes less acute.
However, it does not stop. The longer you
remain in a weightless state, the more accust¬
omed you become to it until, finally, you
"absorb" weightlessness and feel perfectly at
ease. The terrible thing is, however, that this
adaptation to the weightless state is far from
being good for you. If a person is brought back
to Earth in this condition, this may eventually
result in his or her death.
Biologists are fully aware of this problem.
They know that the human organism must not
be allowed to become accustomed to and adapt
to conditions of weightlessness. To achieve this
a programme of physical exercises must be per¬
formed throughout the entire period spent in
space. Orbital space stations have to be pro¬
vided with special exercise rooms.
CHILDREN
OF THE EARTH
After more than thirty years' experience, we
can appreciate what it means psychologically to
be torn away from the Earth and from the rest
of humanity and to find oneself alone, face to
face with infinity. Nostalgia for the Earth
becomes practically the only psychological
support that remains. A stay of several months
in the sealed world of a space station is
undoubtedly an ordeal whose long-term effects
we are as yet unable to assess.
The "terraphiles" maintain that humans are
children of the Earth and cannot live beyond its
confines. Even those who favour crewed space
flights are now more circumspect in their opi¬
nions and no longer claim that the presence of
humans in space is entirely positive. However,
they maintain that often there is no alternative.
Unlike a robot, they say, a person can think
and react to unforeseen circumstances or phe¬
nomena. At present, a human being is the most
perfect of all robots and his or her hands are
capable of intricate work such as no automaton
could match. There are many examples of deli¬
cate repair work carried out by humans in the
course of space flights. Humans will have a
useful role to play in space so long as they
remain to some extent irreplaceable.
But perhaps we should limit the time
human beings stay in space. Perhaps we should
opt for space stations that would be visited
from time to time by crews who would remain
in them only for short periods, during which
they would carry out repairs and bring back
research findings and objects manufactured in
space.
My own view is that, today, we could
manage without crewed spaceflights. As far as
the future is concerned, I believe that a com-

Headquarters In 1963.
promise will be reached between those who
favour the "space without people" position and
those who maintain that "space colonies are the
only answer to the problems facing the Earth".
What if, as might well happen, one of our
space vehicles were to encounter some manifes¬
tation of extra-terrestrial intelligence during a
space flight from Earth? Clearly, only human
beings would be able to sense such a presence.
If we are to give precedence to crewed space
flights it will be in order to detect and listen to
the "intelligent voices" of the universe.
I feel that the era of crewed space flight,
which began some three decades ago, will
continue. Hundreds of men and women will
take the risks and bear the heavy workload for
the sake of the great adventure. The curiosity
inherent in human nature will take us further
and further towards the unknown.

ALTHOUGH it occupies more than 70 per
cent of the world's surface, the ocean is
the least explored part of Planet Earth.
The recent development of Earth-orbiting
satellites to observe the sea surface has pro¬
vided oceanographers with a powerful tool for
gaining a new view of the ocean.
Satellite oceanography began in earnest in
1978 when three satellites Tiros, Nimbus 7
and Seasat were launched, each with instru¬
ments suitable for ocean monitoring. The first
two were primarily meteorological satellites,
but Seasat was dedicated to marine remote sens¬
ing and carried all-weather microwave sensors.
Previously restricted to observations from
buoys and ships, oceanographers now have the
additional ability of monitoring the sea surface
from above. As a result some fascinating new
features of the sea have been revealed. More
significantly, marine scientists can now make
suitable measurements to understand how the
ocean affects the global environment and climate.
THE SATELLITE PLUS FACTOR
There are three ways in which data from satel¬
lites provide what more conventional observa¬
tional methods cannot:
(i) They provide global information (data-sets)
from a single sensor repeated over several
years. To monitor changes in the world ocean
by other means would require an unacceptably
large array of in situ instruments,
(ii) They provide an instantaneous, synoptic
view across a wide area of the sea surface.
Because the sea is ceaselessly changing, stan¬
dard ship surveying methods fail to reveal the
true instantaneous distribution of ocean
variables (such as temperature),
(iii) There are some types of measurements,
such as surface roughness patterns, which
cannot at present be made by methods other
than remote sensing.
Four basic properties of the sea can be mea¬
sured in this way: surface roughness, slope
(typically a few centimetres per 100 kilo
metres), temperature and colour. The first three
all relate to the surface itself, whilst the colour
detected is that of the upper few metres.
Since 1978 the techniques of satellite ocean¬
ography have steadily improved until now
they play an important part in océanographie
programmes. Oceanographers have developed
techniques by means of which more useful
océanographie variables can be derived from
the four basic primary measurements.
A fundamental aspect of remote sensing is to
infer subsurface conditions from the effect they
have on the electromagnetic radiation leaving
or reflected from the sea surface. To do so
requires an understanding of physical processes
occurring in the upper ocean.
For example, ocean colour measured from
satellites is not directly very useful, but some of
the factors that affect the colour are important.
Chlorophyll associated with phytoplankton in
the water affects the green/blue ratio. Thus by a
combination of theoretical insights and care¬
fully planned calibration experiments it has
been possible to derive procedures for interpret¬
ing ocean colour in terms of chlorophyll in the
top few metres of the sea. Similarly, but with
less confidence, colour can be related to the
suspended sediment load in the water, and in
shallow water it can be related to sea depth.
THE ALL-IMPORTANT SENSORS
Several different types of sensor are used to
monitor the ocean from space, employing elec¬
tromagnetic radiation in the visible, thermal
infrared and microwave parts of the spectrum
to transmit information about the sea to the
satellite.
Some of the sensors carried by océan¬
ographie satellites are passive radiometers
which detect the natural emission of radiation
from the sea, or reflected sunlight. Others are
active devices radars which emit their own
microwave radiation.
A synthetic aperture radar (SAR), for
example, generates an image whose brightness

corresponds to the amount of microwave
energy reflected back from the sea surface. This
is controlled entirely by the sea surface condi¬
tions; its roughness, orientation, electrical pro¬
perties and motion. The microwaves cannot
penetrate more than a few millimetres below
the surface, and yet radar images can reveal in
great detail the patterns of features such as
internal waves or even the sea bed topography
at depths of many metres.
The altimeter is another exciting radar in¬
strument which can measure the height of the
sea surface, and hence its slope, to an accuracy
of a few centimetres. This means that through
altimetry the variability of ocean currents can
be detected on a global basis and that the
magnitude of ocean eddies can be measured
across wide expanses of inhospitable sea such as
the Southern Ocean.
Height is measured by timing the pulse on
its journey from the satellite to the sea and back.
If the shape of the returned pulse is examined,
the roughness of the sea can be deduced. The
altimeter is therefore an all-weather monitor of
significant wave height, a parameter of consid¬
erable importance to navigation.
The scatterometer is a radar which views
wider expanses of sea. The average strength of
the microwaves scattered back from the surface
to an oblique-viewing radar is a measure of sea
roughness caused by wind. Consequently the
sensor can measure surface winds across wide
sea areas untouched by weather ships or ships
of passage. Weather forecasts can be improved
by incorporating such data into weather-pre¬
dicting models. This and other radars can also
be used to detect the edge of the polar ice
sheets, and their seasonal variation.
Despite problems caused by cloud cover,
sensors which measure the infrared radiation
emitted by the sea can yield images of the sea
surface temperature (SST). Oceanographers use
this data in many ways, for example, to
monitor turbulent eddies in the ocean or fronts
between water masses of different tempera¬
tures. In shallow seas the temperature can
reveal plumes of river outflows, or distinctive
coastal zones of water which do not seem to
disperse offshore and may serve as a marker for
the locations of schools of fish.
Thus satellites are capable of monitoring sur¬
face winds, ocean waves, sea surface tempera¬
ture, ocean primary production (such as 35

phytoplankton) and the extent of the polar ice
sheets. This they can do not just once, not only
near-instantaneously, but repeatedly over
several years and potentially over several
decades. This type of information is a vital
component of the knowledge required by those
seeking to understand and predict global cli¬
mate change.
The ocean is an integral part of the global
heat engine which drives the weather. Satellites
combined with ship and buoy measurements
promise improved ways of estimating the flux
of heat, water and momentum between the
atmosphere and the ocean. They make feasible
the initiation of global programmes to evaluate
the contribution of the oceans to the climate
system of the world, such as the World Ocean
Circulation Experiment.
SATELLITES BRING
HIGH HOPES
Assuming the data from these programmes are
made available, they will benefit marine scien¬
tists in all parts of the world. In regional and
local seas, remote sensing provides a unique
approach to monitoring the environment for
the management of living resources, fishing,
navigation and coastal erosion. It will become
relatively inexpensive to develop local and
regional programmes for purposes such as fore
casting sea conditions, monitoring pollution or
performing bathymétrie surveys.
Every maritime nation will thus have access
to valuable information needed for manage¬
ment of that part of the ocean that comprises its
Exclusive Economic Zone and need no longer
be hindered by shortages of expensive research
vessels and instrumentation. These will still be
needed, but the value of limited marine
research facilities can be multiplied by the addi¬
tion of satellite data.
Furthermore, marine scientists working in
hitherto isolated areas will be enabled to make
their own unique contribution to the "big
science" programmes of climate change, since
the nature of remote sensing is to provide the
wide-scale perspective which can integrate local
process studies into a global framework.
This optimistic scenario, in which remote
sensing fosters international collaboration in
marine science, will only be possible if ocean¬
ographers have the training in Space Ocean¬
ography necessary for them to process, analyse,
integrate and apply the colossal output of
marine data now beginning to flow from satel¬
lites. With this in mind, UNESCO has developed
a computer-based learning package on analysis
of marine image data, designed for students of
marine and environmental science and manage¬
ment (see opposite page).

HERE COMES BILKO
IAN S. ROBINSON
is Reader in Physical
Oceanography and Head of
the Oceanography
Department at the University
of Southampton, UK. He
heads a group which carries
out research on satellite
oceanography and on
education and training in
océanographie satellite
imagery.
A computer-based learning package initiated
by Unesco through its Training and Educa¬
tion in Marine Sciences Programme
(TREDMAR) is providing the worldwide training
required to keep pace with modern developments
in space oceanography.
At the heart of this package lies a simple
¡mage display software tool-kit called "Bilko",
written for personal computers operating in MS-
DOS. Corrunercial image analysis software
packages require specialized computers. Bilko,
however, was deliberately kept simple to enable it
to run on the most basic of machines.
The package contains lessons which guide
students step by step through the analysis of
several ¡mage data-sets. The software and image
data are stored on magnetic diskettes and the text
of the lessons is printed in a booklet along with an
introductory tutorial on the use of the software.
Bilko leads students with no computing skill
straight into interpretation of satellite image data
of the ocean. Each full screen Bilko image repre¬
sents 131,072 individual scientific measurements
of the ocean. If, for example, a student calls up an
image of sea surface temperature derived from a
satellite's infrared sensor, the cursor on the screen
becomes a "research vessel" which he or she can
"pilot" across the area of ocean illustrated to
"explore" the spatial distribution of temperature
levels.
The first module, produced in July 1989, was
received with enthusiasm by marine science edu¬
cators around the world. Their positive response
led to the planning of further lesson modules
which were to draw on image data from other sea
areas.
Module 2, published in February 1991,
contains material from South American and Aus¬
tralian coastal areas and the Indian Ocean,
written by local scientists. It also contains a
"Lesson for lesson creators" which explains how
to prepare image data for use with Bilko and how
to write a lesson around it. As a result, more mate¬
rial began to flow in from contributors around the
world. This led to the publication of Module 3, in
February 1992.
Bilko is a multi-authored product written by
marine science educators from around the world.
Lesson material from it has been incorporated into
other educational programmes. In parts of the
LJnited States the modules are used for science
teaching in high schools. In the Netherlands the
Open University is adapting five lessons for use in
a course on remote sensing. Several international
training courses and summer schools in marine
remote sensing have used the modules as the
basis of practical classes. Some such courses have
also led to the production of new lessons, includ¬
ing the first African lesson which will form part
of the fourth module to be published early in
1933. As a result of a course held at Lepe, in
Spain, the first three modules have been translated
into Spanish and several new lessons arising from
the course will be published first in a Spanish
module before translation into English.

THK most glamorous and most risky
moment in the life of a spacecraft is "lift¬
off". The world holds its breath, then
tends to forget that the satellite exists . . . until it
sends back astonishing pictures of a planet, or
details of unexpected phenomena such as an
active volcano on a moon that was thought to
be dead.
Not so for the men and women who
control the orbits of, and flow of information
to and from, the satellites. They watch over
by Norman Longdon
their "children" with parental pride and defen¬
sive aggression. When the time comes, mainly
for economic reasons but also due to old age,
for the space equivalent of euthanasia (switch¬
ing off the contact), there arc genuine tears.
The story of some of these forgotten, or
nearly forgotten, space wanderers makes fascin¬
ating reading. Take for example Giotto, the
European Space Agency satellite that led the
international fleet of spacecraft that gave
humans their first look at the nucleus of a

comet, Halley's comet, in 1986. It crashed its
way through the clouds of dust and gas sur¬
rounding Halley, and confirmed the scientists'
belief that comets are "dirty snowballs". Rather
like Samson, Giotto had its eyes put out, for
the camera on board was disabled. Like
Samson, though, it had not lost all its strength,
and so it was put to sleep, hibernating as it
orbited the Sun.
GIOTTO,
A HIBERNATING SPACECRAFT
Four years later, in 1990, after circling the Sun
six times, Giotto was back close to the Earth.
Close in astronomical terms, that is, for it was
still over 22,000 kilometres away. From the
Earth, messages were sent to waken the space¬
craft. It is a staggering achievement that after
such a time lag, and such a journey, a spacecraft
less than three metres in height and weighing
under 600 kilos, could be identified and
brought back to life. Using the Earth's gravita¬
tional pull, Giotto's orbit was changed so that
it could encounter another comet known as
Grigg Skjellerup.
It was partly put back to sleep for a journey
of 1.8 billion kilometres. Wide awake in time
for its encounter with the second comet, it gave
the scientists fresh insight into comets, those
ancient mariners that have ploughed the seas of
space since the time of the solar system's ori¬
gins. After that, it still felt that it was capable of
meeting more comets, and let the controllers
know that it was fit and healthy. So, once again
Giotto has been put back to sleep. It is off on a
long, long journey before returning in July
1999 to within 220,000 kilometres of the Earth.
Already some scientists with really far-reaching
optimism are wondering whether it will be "all
systems go" for a further encounter in 2006.
A TWO-MILLION-YEAR-VOYAGE
TO A RED STAR
If Giotto's voyage seems a lonely trek, it is
nothing to that of Pioneer 10. What is so spe¬
cial about Pioneer 10? Two decades ago it was
sending us back pictures of Jupiter, especially
the Great Red Spot, and telling us about the
many moons circling the giant planet. In 1976 it
crossed Saturn's orbit, and in 1979, the orbit of
Uranus. By 1983, it was considered to have left
the solar system, and was hurtling through
space at 48,000 kilometres an hour. Where is it
heading? Towards a red star, Aldebaran. Even
at that speed it will take two million years for it
to reach the position of the star (which will
have moved on by then). As we do not yet
know enough about star motions, it has not
been possible to calculate its ultimate destina¬
tion. It carries a plaque that it is hoped will
indicate to any civilization that "finds" the space¬
craft where it came from and the nature of
human beings.
While Pioneer looks ever outwards, scien¬
tists are still probing the nature of our Sun.

space station in Earth orbit.
Between May and November
1973, three three-man crews
took turns to live and work
aboard Skylab. In July 1979
the space station re-entered
the Earth's atmosphere and
disintegrated.
Most of our knowledge has been gained from
satellites flying in or near to the ecliptic plane,
that is the saucer-like plane around the Sun in
which the planets orbit. We know nothing
directly of what happens at the poles of the
Sun. Ulysses, the aptly named European satel¬
lite, is on a long odyssey to find out more
about those polar regions. Unfortunately, we
do not have the ability to fire satellites straight
over the Sun. So the engineers have devised a
modern "sling shot" method using the- strong
gravitational field around Jupiter to whip
Ulysses into a polar orbit around the Sun.
Launched in October 1990, Ulysses reached
Jupiter in February 1992. The fly-by of Jupiter
was reached with an accuracy of two seconds!
Ulysses is continuing on its long journey, and
is now on one of the loneliest stretches of its
odyssey. In August 1992 it was at its furthest
point from the Earth, an amazing 938,488,610
kilometres. Its velocity relative to the Earth was
115,521 km/hr., and that relative to the Sun,
31,028 km/hr.
The satellite will from 26 June 1994 to 6
November 1994 pass over the south pole of the
Sun, and from 20 June 1995 to 30 September
1995 over the north pole. The scientists are not
sitting twiddling their thumbs as they wait for
these periods. The scientific data they are receiv¬
ing daily are keeping them very busy. Such is
the excellent state of the spacecraft and its pay-
load that its ability to make a second pass over
the poles cannot be discounted. The scientific
community would certainly welcome such a
possibility.
VOYAGER 2, THE UGLY DUCKLING

life, like many a human, as a sickly child. It was
thought to have collided with its discarded pro¬
pulsion module, then its communication
system failed for six months. But like an ugly
duckling, it turned into a swan, beautiful in its
pictures of the Jupiter moons and the planet
itself. It sent back 15,000 pictures of Jupiter and
its five major satellites, including dramatic
views of seven erupting volcanoes during 1979.
On to Saturn, reached in 1981, and 18,000
images, especially of the famous rings around
the planet.
Back on Earth, and unknown to the space¬
craft, a battle was being fought in the United
States over the money needed to keep in touch
with Voyager 2. The battle was won while the
spacecraft was 2,900 million kilometres away,
approaching Uranus (the third largest planet in
the solar system). After eight years on its
journey. Voyager 2 arrived within seventy
seconds of its predicted time (a good model for
some railway systems on Earth).
Our knowledge of Uranus and its moons
owes much to Voyager 2. It was discovering
new moons with almost indecent haste, giving
scientists no time to react to one discovery
before it popped up with another startUng fact
or image. It showed, in images of Uranus itself,
a dark area around the south pole, which led to
speculation that the planet had been hit by an
object the size of the Earth: a collision of major
head-ache proportions. Distances can perhaps
be best described in terms of the Earth: thus
Uranus takes eighty-four Earth years to com¬
plete one orbit around the Sun.

Agency's Publication Division.
Voyager's work was not yet completed. On
it sailed to Neptune, out on the cold edges of
the solar system. If Uranus' travels around the
Sun are slow and majestic, they are almost
dynamic when set against Neptune's pon¬
derous movements. Neptune takes 165 Earth
years to complete one circle of the Sun. As
Neptune was only discovered in 1846, it has
not completed one "year" since its existence
was known to humans. Voyager continued to
startle the scientists. It found a third moon, and
then five more. Although the temperature on
the surface of Neptune is -215° Celsius, there
were winds up to 2,415 kilometres an hour
blowing. On the largest moon, Triton, active
volcanoes were found.
And so Voyager 2 joined the caravan of space¬
craft that have left the solar system. Its signals
will continue to reach Earth, even if no one will
be listening to them, until the year 2013. By
then it will be 106 times further away from the
Sun than the Earth is. It can look forward to
flying by the star Sirius in 358,000 years.
Of course many spacecraft are drawn back
into the atmosphere surrounding the Earth, or
other planets, there to burn up, and perhaps
flash briefly across some night sky. That hap¬
pened recently to a Pioneer-Venus spacecraft.
After fourteen years (thirteen more than
expected) of orbiting Venus, and sending back
more than ten triUion bits of data, it ran out of
fuel. Reporting to the press, the project
manager stated "We are saddened by the loss of
an old friend." To those whose work is
connected with space, the satellites are genuine¬
ly "alive" and members of the family.
WHAT OF THE FUTURE?
In times of recession and political upheaval,
space is not necessarily a prestigious subject;
not a vote-catcher in many countries. In all the
countries that make up the space community, a
much more quizzical look is thus being given at
the expenses inherent in space programmes.
Those nations (particularly Russia) that com¬
prised the USSR are looking to the West for
co-operative ventures, knowing that they are
unlikely to be able to afford space programmes
on the scale they have known previously.
The cold war elements of space pro¬
grammes do not have the political support they
once had, so that we are seeing moves to
continue on more peaceful lines some of the
developments associated with former military
demands. The political and economic implica¬
tions of the new situation have yet to be
worked out in terms of final agreements relat¬
ing to jointly designed and built spacecraft,
launcher services and shared facilities. There is
a strong political will for co-operative ventures,
but funding and allocation of contracts, tasks
and return on investment are the hard facts of
space as of other industrial enterprises.

URING the 1970s, when scientists first
started to draw attention to the possible
dangers of debris in space, the general
reaction was to dismiss their warnings as
unduly alarmist. Outer space, it was said, was
so vast that a collision or close encounter of
two objects in space was so improbable as to be
verging on the impossible.
This basic notion of the limitless vastness of
space was so tenacious and so ingrained that
the continuous growth of activities in space was
ignored and some quite bizarre "uses" of space
were suggested. These included the disposal of
nuclear waste by sending it into high orbit and
the positioning in space of huge reflectors to

beam sunlight to the Earth so as to warm the
polar regions, keep shipping lanes free of ice,
prevent frost at night and to provide illumina¬
tion for large cities.
Fortunately, none of these projects came to
fruition, but the launching of weather, commu¬
nications, mapping, navigational, military and
space exploration satellites continued apace.
Dr. Walter Flury, Secretary of the Space Debris
Working Group, estimates that there are about
7,000 trackable objects currently in orbit
around the Earth. "Of these," he says, "fewer
than about 400 are operational satellites. The
remainder are abandoned satellites (21 per
cent), upper stages (16 per cent), fragments of 41

satellites and upper stages (45 per cent), and
mission-related objects, such as lens covers,
separation bolts or clamp-bands (12 per cent)."
Already, on a number of occasions, space¬
craft have had to make emergency manoeuvres
to avoid collisions. In September 1991, the
Space Shuttle Discovery had to take action to
avoid the rocket body of Cosmos 955 and in
November 1991 the Space Shuttle Atlantis had
to dodge space debris of more than a ton.
Experts say that even a pea-sized fragment
traveUing at orbital speed (about five kilometres
a second) could shatter a $100-million satellite.
Low-orbiting satellites whose remote-sens¬
ing radar systems are powered by nuclear
reactors, such as the Soviet RORSAT (Radar
Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite) series, repre¬
sent a further potential hazard. Because they
are launched into very low orbit, the resistance
of the upper reaches of the Earth's atmosphere
and the pull of Earth gravity mean that the
satellites eventually fall back to Earth.
Theoretically, as one of these satellites
comes to the end of its operational life, the
reactor is separated from the main body and
dispatched into a higher orbit, where it should
remain. On occasions, however, the boosting
system has been known' to fail. In 1978, for
example, the reactor aboard Cosmos 974 re¬
entered the atmosphere with the satellite. The
nuclear fuel core enclosed within the reactor
was not vaporized when the satellite re-entered
and a large quantity of radioactive debris was
scattered over the Great Slave Lake area of
Canada.
Other threats exist. According to the
experts' calculations, there is one chance in a
hundred that, during its seventeen-year design
life, the Hubble Space Telescope will be severe¬
ly damaged by a collision with a large piece of
debris. This is a barely acceptable risk in view
of the fact that, at a cost of some $1.5 billion, it
is the most expensive scientific instrument ever
made.
THE VANISHING
NIGHT SKY
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was car¬
ried into orbit on 24 April 1990 by the Space
Shuttle Discovery. It was designed to view the
cosmos with a resolution ten times better than
would be possible from any Earth-based tele¬
scope, for the Earth's atmosphere obscures
optical astronomers' view of the universe
through ground-based optical telescopes and
blocks some ultraviolet and other forms of
electromagnetic radiation.
Air pollution has aggravated the problem.
This was why England's Royal Observatory
was established in 1675, at Greenwich, then
well outside the city of London. However, it
was the introduction of electric light at the turn
of this century that finally eliminated cities as
places from which the night sky could be

enjoyed, much less studied, and the spill of
street lighting directed uselessly upwards
became yet another urban pollutant.
The combination of air pollution and urban
sky glow, mostly due to badly sited and de¬
signed lighting, has led many of the world's
most famous observatories to close down or to
seek remote sites for their optical telescopes.
Both Europeans and Americans have installed
their southern hemisphere telescopes in the
Andes and in northern Chile, where the wea¬
ther is very dry, the air is clear and steady and
the areas selected are sparsely populated. To
study the skies of the northern hemisphere,
astronomers from America and from several
other countries now occupy the summit of
Mauna Kea, a volcano in the Hawaian chain of
islands, which they claim is the highest, darkest
and finest site in the world.
"This may be true," says David Malin of the
Anglo-Australian Observatory, "but neither
the fringes of the Atacama desert nor the
summit of a Hawaian volcano are comfortable
places to live or work. Their deliberate remote¬
ness makes them expensive to construct and
operate and access to them is not easy."
QUIET PLEASE,
WE ARE LISTENING
TO THE STARS
If optical astronomers are the eyes of the
world, radio astronomers are its ears. To op¬
erate effectively, radio astronomers need quiet
skies as they seek to capture cosmic whispers.
Today, however, that search is taking place in a
rising cacophony of interference.
The radiation studied by radio astronomers is
exceedingly weak. As Paul Vanden Bout of the
US National Radio Astronomy Observatory, at
Charlottesville, Virginia, has pointed out: "All
the radio energy ever gathered by all the radio
telescopes that have ever been built would not
keep a one-watt light bulb illuminated for one

thousandth of a second. . . . The problem of
interference has become acute because the con¬
tinuing development of technology has both
enabled radio astronomers to achieve ever higher
sensitivity to weak signals and, at the same time,
spawned a flood of governntent, commercial and
consumer applications."
We owe much of our knowledge about the
universe beyond the Earth's surface to radio
astronomy. From the Sun and Moon, to plan¬
ets, comets and asteroids, to stars, mascrs and
pulsars, to galaxies, quasars and the remnant
radiation of the Big Bang itself, radio astronomy
provides information vital to our understand¬
ing of the cosmos.
In addition to its importance as a window
on the universe, radio astronomy provides
practical benefits for society, including the tra¬
ditional astronomical role in time-keeping and
navigation, technology development and
science education. But the pursuit of radio
astronomy is critically dependent on freedom
from interference from artificial sources of
radio emission.
In 1959, radio astronomy was recognized
as an official "service" by the international
regulatory system that controls the use of the
spectrum. With that recognition came some
protection primary use of a few bands and
the sharing of others. These bands are what
might be called "radio spectrum wilderness
preserves".
Full consideration and attention should also
be given to existing regulations governing the
far side of the Moon as a radio quiet reserve.
There is already one such reserve on Earth
the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) in the
eastern United States. Its existence has pre¬
served the excellence of the Green Bank, West
Virginia, National Radio Astronomy Observa¬
tory site for radio astronomy.
Paul Vanden Bout predicts that eventually
radio astronomers will be driven to using extra¬
terrestrial sites for their telescopes. Although
use of the Moon as an observatory site would
imply construction and operating costs far
beyond the current level of national expendi¬
ture for astronomy, distant generations will be
grateful for what might well become the only
spot relatively close to the Earth from which
they would be able to study the universe at
radio wavelengths.
"Radio astronomy," says Paul Vanden
Bout, "is a fragile and threatened link between
human beings and the universe at large. Recog¬
nizing its importance and placing it on the
environmental agenda is a first step toward its
preservation. Failure to do this will lead slowly
but inevitably to the loss of our ability to hear
the whispers of the cosmos, leaving us to
contemplate our own electronic babble."

REMOTE SENSING AND
NATURAL RISKS
Every year, countless natural
phenomena all over the world
cause widespread loss of
human life and injury, as well
as material damage. In a bid to
mobilize current scientific and
technical knowledge to lessen
the impact of these disasters,
the United Nations General
Assembly proclaimed the
1990s the International
Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction. Unesco, in turn, has
launched a series of studies
aimed at using aerial
photography and satellite data
to evaluate risks due to
geological factors. Three pilot
projects are under way in the
city of La Paz in Bolivia, the
Chicamocha valley In Colombia,
and the Linkou site in Taiwan,
all regions which are
particularly exposed to
landslide hazards and for which
it has been possible to plot
maps showing vulnerable
areas. These studies have
been widely disseminated and
have given rise to international
data-exchange and technology-
transfer programmes.
MISSION TO PRAGUE
A Unesco mission has visited
the National Library in Prague
to study the possibility of
transferring thousands of
manuscripts, early printed
books and other works of great
artistic value onto optical disks
and other modern aids. Its
purpose was to provide
assistance in deciding on what
methods should be used to
store the originals, depending
on the nature and age of the
documents, and on ways of
reproducing them, so that they
can be more easily consulted.
The mission formed part of the
"Memory of the World" project,
which seeks to safeguard the
treasures of libraries and
archives through the use of
new information technology.
WIDENING ACCESS TO
GENOME RESEARCH
FINDINGS
On 28 October 1992, Dr.
Charles Auffray, a French
scientist working on the Human
Genome Project, presented the
findings of his work to the
Director-General of Unesco,
thereby making available to the
scientific community at large
the 2,000 sequences identified
by his team from muscular and
lymphocytary genes. The goal
of the Human Genome Project,
which was launched in the mid-
1980s, is to identify and define
every human gene. Knowledge
of the human genome, which
will help medical science to
understand, treat and prevent
genetic diseases, is a potential
source of profit, and attempts
have been made to patent
sequences from genes before
their functions have been
discovered. Unesco considers
that the common genetic
heritage belongs to all
humankind and is
endeavouring to ensure
btoader access to research
findings, especially for the
developing countries.
ANGKOR ON COMPUTER
All the documentation on the
restoration work undertaken at
Angkor by the Ecole Française
d'Extrême Orient (the French
School of Far Eastern Studies)
from 1909 onwards has
recently been computerized.
Reports, photographs, maps,
drawings of architectural
details and notes from the
logbooks which restorers and
archaeologists kept for
decades have been reproduced
on diskettes and microfiches.
All this material was presented
to the Ambassador of
Cambodia to France at a
ceremony held at Unesco
Headquarters in October 1992.
HERITAGE 2001
In March 1992, Unesco began
to set up a photographic and
digital data base on the cultural
and natural masterpieces that
form the common heritage of
humanity. The project will be
carried out over a 5-year period
with the Caixa Foundation of
Barcelona and the Gamma
Agency, in collaboration with
Kodak and France Telecom.
Entitled Heritage 2001, it will
use the latest high-
performance data-retrieval,
archiving and transmission
techniques to produce an
unprecedented collection of
images that will be made
available to communication and
documentation networks all
over the world. The
photographs will be both
scientifically accurate and of
high artistic quality.

Culture and
new-found freedoms
WHAT is culture? For the nineteenth-century
English poet and critic Matthew Arnold, culture
was "acquainting ourselves with the best that has
been known and said in the world, and thus with the his¬
tory of the human spirit". This traditional viewpoint tends
to identify culture with the past and to link it primarily
with fine arts and literature; a cultured person is one whose
mind has been improved, and preferably enriched, by the
"humanities". In the twentieth century, another, much
broader, meaning which takes a more anthropological
approach has been grafted on to this first definition. At the
World Conference on Cultural Policies held in Mexico City
ten years ago, the international community took note of
this broader definition and affirmed that culture could be
regarded as "the whole complex of distinctive spiritual,
material, intellectual and emotional features that charac¬
terize a society or social group", and that "it includes not
only the arts and letters but also modes of life, the funda¬
mental rights of the human being, value systems, traditions,
and beliefs".
In this sense, culture no longer refers simply to know¬
ledge of the arts; it also covers language, thought, innova¬
tion, creativity, and critical skills. Naturally it includes the
material heritage of a society, but it also extends to the
shared symbolic, spiritual or ethical heritage in which indi¬
viduals find their identity in the present. It is the thread that
links the past, present and future of a society, and the back¬
drop for individual creativity. Culture is therefore both a
source of major political, economic and social problems and
a key factor in solving them.
THE KEY TO DEVELOPMENT
Before the decolonization process which began after the
Second World War, development theories rarely left much
room for consideration of the socio-cultural context
within which development might take place. Economics
was reality, culture was something else. Economics was
tangible, culture was intangible and the idea that culture
could make an input to development strategies would have
been considered far-fetched indeed. Development then
was seen as taking place in a cultural vacuum or an inert
human environment.
Then the shortcomings and failures of this approach
began to emerge. The evidence is incontrovertible: focusing
on the one-dimensional abstraction of homo economicus
not only neglects the enormous depth and breadth of our
real nature as human beings but is a failure even in its own
terms, since economic growth is significantly dependent on
the cultural variable of creativity and adaptability.
Culture, long regarded by policy-makers as something
of an ornament or even a luxury, has accordingly begun to
find its proper place in the political agenda of the interna¬
tional community. Debates on general policy invariably
refer to the multifarious ways in which culture exercises a
key influence in the contemporary world. Many examples
come to mind. Inter-ethnic relations, whether in times of
strife or of peaceful coexistence, are clearly rooted essen¬
tially in culture. The worldwide movement towards greater
democracy and freedom is at once universal and culture-
specific, differing in its form from continent to continent
and society to society.
THE CHALLENGE OF DIVERSITY
The new flowering of freedom which the world has seen
in the last few years has strengthened the role of culture.
Not long ago the Berlin Wall was still standing and Vaclav
Havel was still a political prisoner in the country of which
he was to become President. Nelson Mandela was also a
prisoner, and President de Klerk had yet to set in train
with him the process that we all devoutly hope will even¬
tually lead to a united and democratic South Africa. The
terrible threat of a nuclear war between the two super¬
powers was omnipresent.
This new-found freedom has unleashed enormous
potential both for good and for evil. And nowhere more
so than between neighbouring peoples of different religions
or ethnicity. Old scores and rivalries, simmering for so long,
are now being settled. At the same time, new problems are
appearing. Are we willing to take up the challenge of living
by choice in pluralistic societies? Are we willing to accept,
and even to welcome, those of different colour, different
religion, different language, and different culture and not
just in the country next door, but even in the house next
door? We touch here on the most problematic aspect of cul¬
tural identity how to ensure that diversity rhymes with
dialogue, that difference is perceived not as a threat but as a
potential source of enrichment.
In this world to whose imbalances, injustices and absur¬
dities I am constantly drawing attention, as the North con¬
tinues to consume more than it needs while the South is still
trying desperately to obtain the basic necessities, only one
resource is shared equally and what a wonderful one it is:
the resource of culture and of human wisdom and under¬
standing. It is this wealth and diversity of cultures and of
understanding that UNESCO, guided by the universal ideals
set forth in its Constitution, is determined to make better
known and place at the service of human development. In
order to do this, UNESCO needs the help of everyone, at all
levels of civil society. It has already done much to promote
dialogue, but we still have a long way to go to persuade
world leaders that although culture is at the root of many
conflicts, it offers the only possibility of reconciliation. 45

The inauguration of Aurovllle on 28 February
1968. During the ceremony, people from over

ON a February day in 1968, some
5,000 people from many countries
gathered on a remote plateau in
south India for the inauguration ofAuroville.
In a gesture of unity, young people from
each delegation placed a handful of earth
from their country in an inaugural urn
containing the charter of the new city.
Auroville takes its name from the Indian
mystic and philosopher Sri Aurobindo
(1872-1950) whose works and ideas inspired
its creation. /Jso known as "the city of dawn"
and "the city the Earth needs", it is this year
celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of
its foundation.
Its story actually begins much earlier,
with the meeting shortíy before the First
World War between Sri Aurobindo and Mira
Alfassa, an artist and visionary from France.
Together they worked in India for "a new
creation, beginning with a model town and
ending with a perfect worid". After the philo¬
sopher's death in Í95Ü, Mira Alfassa, who
had become known as "the Mother", con¬
tinued the realization of the dream she
shared with Sri Aurobindo.

place of peace, concord and harmony,
where all the fighting instincts of man would
be used exclusively to conquer the causes of
his sufferings and miseries, to surmount his
weaknesses and ignorance, to triumph over
his limitations and incapacides; a place
where the needs of the spirit and concern
for progress would take precedence over the
satisfaction of desires and passions, the
search for pleasure and material enjoyment.
"In this place, children would be able to
grow and develop integrally without losing
contact with their souls; education would be
given not for passing examinations or obtain¬

existing faculties and bring forth new ones.
In this place, tides and positions would be
replaced by opportunities to serve and orga¬

equally provided for, and intellectual, moral
and spiritual superiority would be expressed
in the general organization not by an
increase in the pleasures and powers of life
but by increased duties and responsibilities.
Beauty in all its artistic forms, painting,
sculpture, music, literature, would be
equally accessible to all; the ability to share
in the joy it brings would be limited only by
the capacities of each one and not by social
and financial position.
"For in this ideal place money would no
longer be the sovereign lord; individual
worth would have a far greater importance

oneself and of developing one's capacities

human relationships, which are normally
based almost exclusively on competition
and strife, would be replaced by relation¬
ships of emulation in doing well, of collabo¬
ration and real brotherhood."
The Mother wrote these words in 1954.
Construction plans began to take shape in
the early 1960s, and in 1965 the Mother
issued her first public message in which she
stated that "Auroville wants to be a universal
town where men and women of all countries
are able to live in peace and progressive har¬
mony, above all creeds, all politics and all
nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to
realize human unity."
The site chosen for Auroville is a dozen
kilometres northeast of Pondicherry and five
kilometres from the sea. It is located on the
Coromandel coastal plain and extends over
an area of some 20 square kilometres. At the
outset the site was nothing more than a bare
wasteland. One of the first Aurovillians, Alan
Lithman, remembers: "A merciless Sun beat
down upon this wretched piece of earth,
bleaching it bone white or a brittie terra¬
cotta. A once-living earth was dying. We
reached the edge of a canyon whose fingers
gouged through the landscape. My friend
pointed across the ravine to the barren
plateau beyond, where a few palmyra trees
shimmered like phantoms in the heat waves.
'There it is,' he said. 'Auroville'. I looked and
saw nothing but a vacant landscape that slid
into the Bay of Bengal. How could I possibly
live here? How could anyone?"
Thanks to years of hard work, this place
where 700 people from some twenty-five
countries now live permanently slowly began
to come to life again. "Looking back across
the threshold ofthat canyon I crossed twenty
years ago," says Alan Lithman, "I see . . .
forests and grasslands filled with flowers and
the birds and other wildlife that had disap¬
peared. I see what can be done with hardly
any means or resources and under the most
impossible conditions. ... 1 see what can be
done by the power of simply doing it. And as
1 turn toward the starkly contrasting land¬
scape behind me, I see all that is yet to be
done."
But no one person can claim the credit
for this "miracle". It was possible simply
because of people working together the
illiterate villager and the university pro¬
fessor, the scientist and the housewife, and
afl those who have volunteered to take part
in this adventure. The local people contrib¬
ute in many ways. Through its Village Action
network, Auroville is involved in programmes
for "co-evolution".
THE IDEAL OF
UNENDING EDUCATION'
Meenakshi, an award-winning Tamil poet,
lives in Auroville and helps in co-ordinating
village relations and educational and cultural
programmes. "Many of the Indian residents
ofAuroville are young Tamils who have come
because of contacts through work, sports
or school," he says. Meenakshi feels that
for them Auroville represents a "new order,
a freedom to learn and become when
compared to the social oppression of the
villages."
The ideal of "unending education" is
actively pursued. Depti, from the Punjab, is
a teacher at the "Last School" who has been
involved in bringing some of India's finest
artists to perform at Auroville. "They all
identify with the inner reality of Auroville
and respond positively to the atmosphere of
Aurovillians practise organic farming

2 million seedlings have been sown in tree
plantations at Auroville.

freedom and beauty that exists here," she
says. "1 have discovered a deeper Indianness
since coming to Auroville, as the process of
finding oneself here sometimes accentuates
one's national characteristics before one
goes beyond them. Finally you become an
Aurovillian, and Auroville is an inner pursuit
that has nothing to do with an external per¬
sonality h is a pursuit of the soul and the
soul knows no nationality. I believe it is the
destiny of Auroville and India to be linked."
She recalls a remark once made in the
Indian Parliament to the effect that Auroville
is "an arrow shot into the future".
In 1969, Indira Gandhi, then Prime
Minister of India, warmly greeted the cre¬
ation of Auroville, and during its session of
October-November f970, Unesco's General
Conference noted that Auroville was prepar¬
ing to become "an instrument of education
capable of meeting the formidable demands
of our age, linking East and West in a new
relationship".
After the Mother's death in f973, Auro¬
ville went through a critical period. The par¬
ticipants in this "laboratory" of humanity
had to develop the inner strength to make
Auroville work. In 1980, a decision of the
Supreme Court of India enabled the resi¬
dents of Auroville to continue working
unimpeded on behalf of their ideáis. An Act
of Pariiament voted in f 988 created an Auro¬
ville Foundation with an international ad¬
visory council to ensure that the ideals of
Auroville are safeguarded.
During the 1980s, institutes for educa¬
tional and scientific research were estab¬
lished, and afforestation and erosion control
programmes continued. Advances in the
design and manufacture of renewable
energy systems, notably windmills and
biogas systems, have proved successful.
There has been intense activity in the pro¬
vision of cost-effective housing, where there

has been progress in the use and production
of stabilized earth block technology.
At the beginning of the f 990s, the work
accomplished over the previous twenty years
can be clearly seen, with some of the infra¬
structure and many community services in
place and the giant sphere of the Matri-
mandir, the "soul" of Auroville, nearing com¬
pletion. Viewed from the outside, this "Dwel¬
ling Place of the Mother" (the meaning of
"Matrimandir" in Sanskrit) or "Pavilion of
Divine Love" is a flattened sphere 36 metres
in diameter. Two spiral steel ramps give access
to the immense circular inner chamber, mea¬
suring 24 metres in diameter by 16 metres in
height, witii its twelve white marble-clad wall
panels and rhythmically-spaced columns
topped by a conical roof. At floor level, right in
the middle of this meditation chamber, a fine
crystal globe picks up the reflection of the
Sun's rays funnelled down from a tracker
heliostat on the roof of the Matrimandir. A
lake and twelve flower gardens will be created
around the Matrimandir
Is it a religion? When she described her
vision of the Matrimandir in 1970, the
Mother flrmly insisted that it was not. There
would be "A fixed day or time for the visitors,"
she added, "and the rest of the time only for
those who are serious, serious and sincere,
who want to learn to concentrate. No fixed
meditations, but they should stay there in
silence, in silence and concentration. A place
for trying to find one's consciousness."

The charter ofAuroville
1. Auroville belongs to nobody in particular. Auroville belongs to humanity
as a whole. But to live in Auroville one must be a willing servitor of the
Divine Consciousness.
2. Auroville will be the place of an unending education, of constant pro¬
gress, and a youth that never ages.
.3. Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking
advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Aurovllle will
boldly spring towards future realizations.
4. Aurovllle will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living
embodiment of an actual hluman Unity.

ART UNDERGROUND
In your April 1992 issue on "Art in
the Street", you published an
article on works of art that
embellish the stations of
underground railway systems in
several of the world's cities. This
has prompted me to send you a
sheet of postage stamps, part of a
series issued by the Argentine
postal authorities in 1980, which
depicts the ceramic tile murals in
the Métro stations of Buenos
Aires. These frescoes, which are
eighteen metres long and two
metres high, portray key episodes
in the history of Argentina
between 1836 and 1 936. The sheet
shown above depicts staging
posts on the road linking Buenos
Aires with Upper Peru (present-
day Bolivia) and Santiago (Chile).

WHAT ABOUT WOMEN
TEACHERS?
As I read the articles on Socrates,
Spinoza, Sartre and others in your
September 1992 issue, I began to
feel somewhat uneasy. It seems
that the only people you regard as
"knowledge bearers" are those
who transmit pui'eiy intellectual
knowledge and academic book-
learning. Arc these men of letters
the only repositories of human
knowledge, of all that shapes and
enriches human hearts and
minds, and makes us not only
thinking beings but creative,
imaginative ones?
I looked closely at the
illustrations and what did I see?
Men holding pieces ofwriting
(and swords too) and men talking;
thinkers and piles of papers,
desks, gaming tables but even
the games were for intellectuals;
children listening with rapt
attention to male teachers, their
eyes reading blackboards covered
with verbs, conjugations like
works of art drawn in chalk, their
brains waiting to be filled or
already full. But there was no
indication that any fingers or
hands were connected to these
brains. No illustration showed
hands sculpting or plucking a
stringed instrument; there were
no masters visualizing and
drawing a face or a silhouette, no
skilled jewellers or potters using
their hands to create a shape in
clay.
But what really makes me
very angry, apart from the fact
that there is no reference to
skilled artists or craftsmen in your
issue, is the complete absence of
women teachers! Not one photo
shows a woman surrounded by an
attentive group of young
students, or holding up a
manuscript for her pupils to see.
Perhaps you were unable to think
of a single woman "knowledge
bearer" I won't go so far as to
write "thinker", a category which
cannot even be imagined in the
feminine gender a single
woman producer or midwife of
knowledge worthy of a place
among your chosen ma.sters.
I think you should have used
your ingenuity to find and give a
place, however lowly, to the other
half of our humanity. After all, the
issue was intended as a tribute to
teachers, who today are more
likely than not to be women.

THE UNFULFILLED PROMISE
OF TV
I have a number of misgivings
about your October 1992 issue
dedicated to the glory of
television. In its early days
television, like radio, held out the
promise of intellectual
enrichment, but it has now
become an instrument of
mindless sensationalism.
Anything and everything is shown
so long as it fills the hours of
broadcasting time. Violence is (he
staple of news broadcasts, and
each subject is inundated with a
torrent of degrading images. And
the programmes! Sex and
violence are the main if not the
only themes designed to attract
viewers. I am ashamed to think
that television has become such a
depraving force. And then we
wonder about the behaviour of
our young people and the havoc
caused hy all kinds of marauding
demonstrators.

AN EDUCATIVE MAGAZINE
Congratulations on the judicious
choice of subject matter in your
magazine, which I use as a
teaching aid and guide. My
students very much enjoy the
various subjects treated in the
(Courier, especially the
Greenwatch pages, the inclusion
of which was an admirable idea. 1
hope your magazine will stay on
the right track by continuing to
inform, educate and warn people
woridwide especially in Africa.
