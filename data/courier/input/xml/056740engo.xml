This miniature from Baghdad (Iraq) depicting a scribe copying a text, dates from
the year 686 of the Mohammedan Era (1287 A.D.). It embellishes a manuscript of
the " Epistles " of the Brothers of Purity, a group of philosophers and men of
science who lived in Basra. Iraq, in the 10th century A.D. Compiled from the
letters written by these scholars, the Epistles compose an " encyclopedia " of
52 treatises on mathematics, logic, natural sciences, psychology and metaphysics.
Many of the views expressed therein were contrary to orthodox Islamic doctrines,
and most of the " Brothers " writings were burned in the 12th century A.D.

1970 has been designated as
International Education Year to
focus world attention on today's
crisis in education a problem
affecting governments and teachers,
parents and young people in
every country. In this issue, the
"Unesco Courier" discusses some
of the burning questions that
have brought world education
to the crossroads of a critical
reappraisal of its aims and methods.
Other aspects will be examined
in forthcoming issues during
International Educational Year.

T,
International
Education
HIS year, 1970, is to be International Education
Year. The decision was taken at the General Assembly
of the United Nations by a unanimous vote late in 1968,
which is to say that the world community agreed that an
International Education Year was both necessary and useful.
Responsibility for guiding the implementation at international
level was placed on Unesco.
Education is a large enterprise. It has been said that
teachers form the largest single professional group in the
world; and the process of education in schools, colleges
and less formal situations goes on all the time and occupies
a considerable part of the world's population. Why then
should a special occasion be declared and why should it
take the form of an international year? Any answer will
have to show clearly in what way 1970 would be different,
educationally speaking, from 1969 or 1971.
Increasing problems, in terms of their size and also
of their nature, are besetting the educational enterprise
throughout the world. An international conference held at
Williamsburg, Virginia, in October 1967, on the theme "The
World Crisis in Education" {1), revealed that deep-seated
maladjustments in most educational systems are bringing
us fast to the verge of a crisis. And it was at the
Williamsburg Conference that the idea of an International
Education Year was launched.
In the developing parts of the world the issues are
fairly well known and are keenly felt by the people directly
concerned. In spite of very heavy state expenditures on
education and brave efforts by those involved in the
process, the gap between goals and achievements seems
to widen steadily.
by Leo Fernig
LEO FERNIG took up his appointment as Director of the International
Bureau of Education in Geneva, on lanury 1, 1970. He was previously
Director of the Department for the Advancement of Education at
Unesco. where during the past 20 years he played a leading role in
the elaboration and execution of Unesco's education programme.

P UTTING this in simple terms, most of the newly
independent countries have attempted to provide a modest
level of education for all their citizens, for this is a basic
human right; they have attempted also to develop education
beyond the primary stage in order to train sufficient middle
and higher level people to speed up national development.
Yet both the humanitarian and the economic goals seem
to be no nearer now than they were a decade ago:
As populations have risen and economic structures have ,
not expanded fast enough, the belief that investment in
educational facilities is an economic investment has been
tempered by a realization that education as it now exists
is a slow and not very efficient process. The economic
returns to be gained from creating schools now will not
arrive in time for additional schools to be provided next
year or in three or four years time.
Still more striking has been evidence that the very
structures of these educational systems forms of
schooling, curricula and teaching methods based upon
patterns introduced before independence are themselves
charged with the possibility of a great deal of wastage or
inefficiency. A large number of pupils leave school
prematurely or fail their grades and therefore spend several
years in the same classroom.
From the point of view of public funds, in the majority
of developing countries it costs between two and four
times as much to put a pupil through a basic primary school
course as it would have cost had he proceeded at a normal
pace of completing one grade a year.
In the developed countries the economic situation may

analysis. Oxford University Press, 1968.

be better, but it is doubtful whether the educational crisis
is any less severe. There have been a number of
challenges to the established order of things. In some
cases the challenge has come from the students themselves,
notably at universities, who feel that the patterns of
organization and teaching, as well as the adequacy of
preparation for professional life, leave a great deal to be
desired. In other cases the challenge has come from
employers, organized professional groups, or from the
teachers themselves.
As life in the industrial societies becomes more and
more complex the relevance of existing arrangements for
educating and training young people is questioned. Or
rather, what is called into doubt is the policy of continuing
on established lines, of providing more schooling for more
students, and making it last longer. At even the lowest
level of analysis, such a policy can only result in a similar
economic burden to that already witnessed in the developing
parts of the world.
It would appear, therefore, to be a common view
throughout the world that we need to pause for a moment,
in this vast and continuing enterprise of education, and see
what we are doing, how fast we are going and where we
think we want to go.
In the course of such reflection it is likely that we will
discover that we are attempting to face a twentieth or
twenty-first century world with institutions and methods
which date back to the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries.
We will discover the need to change and we may,
collectively, achieve some understanding of the nature of
this change and therefore plan to bring it about. This
seems to be the general idea behind the International
Education Year (IEY).
HAT is the IEY? It could be described as a
combined effort by all the countries of the world to do
something extra or special about their educational problems
in order "to mobilize energies and inspire initiatives in
education and training" (the phrase used by the original pro¬
poser of the IEY in the United Nations General Assembly).
The IEY is basically a national affair for each country
to undertake. The possible types of action comprise any
or all of a natural chain of operations: study and reflection
about education or about some aspect of education across
the nation; the identification of outstanding problems;
experimental activities in order to find solutions to such
problems; full involvement of the public in the discussion
of educational issues; all of these leading finally to changes
of educational policies.
For the most part such a national exercise would be
focused on the educational provisions within the country
itself. However, there are some aspects that go beyond
national boundaries. Each country will find inevitably that
it can take account of, learn from, the experience from
other countries, and in turn make a contribution to others.
The latter aspect could even, in some cases, take the shape
of increased educational aid from developed to developing
countries.
This is of course a broad and theoretical outline. The
main point to establish is that activities undertaken with
particular reference to International Education Year should
have some special quality, should have an element of
spontaneity, should bear directly on the need for, and the
desire to, change.
As a result of the United Nations decision and of Unesco's
appeal to member states to prepare programmes for the

INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION YEAR (Continued)
International Education Year, an increasing number of
national programmes are being sent forward. Two or three
brief examples may be given.
In France, six important journals in the field of education
will devote special issues to the IEY themes; a seminar
is to be organized on the mechanisms of the learning
process, and late in 1970 the French National Commission
for Unesco intends to arrange a research conference on
the evaluation of projects in functional literacy.
Japan is preparing an ambitious programme which may
include national events (including the issue of a special IEY
postage stamp), the creation of new institutions (a university
and an institute for in-service teacher training) and the
increase of contacts between Japanese educators and
those abroad. Aid to developing countries will form an
important part of the Japanese contribution to IEY.
In Tanzania the IEY emphasis will be placed on specially
devised new courses at a high level directed for the most
part to innovation and reform in education.
The notion that the International Education Year consists
of a large number of national programmes is easy to
accept, but it should be made clear that such national
programmes are themselves not merely a matter for a small
group of officials in a central ministry. Adequately to
achieve the objectives of the Year and to focus attention
on the direction of educational change, it will be essential
for all parts of the national community to participate in
one way or another.
Community action at the level of local authorities or
even of individual schools and colleges will be essential
in any country. The role of teachers and students is
obvious since they are the people most directly concerned
with the educational process perhaps too much so. The
other groups and institutions in the nation, parents,
employers, churches, professional associations, need also
to be engaged in study, experimentation, discussion and
proposals for policy changes.
|T is probably true that those national pro¬
grammes for International Education Year will succeed best
which achieve or even stem from widespread action by
communities, associations and institutions throughout the
country.
However, it must be recalled that this is an "Inter¬
national" Education Year and one may ask whether there
will be anything more to it than an aggregate of separate
national programmes. And indeed international bodies do
have an essential rôle. They provide the means for
communication between countries, offer a framework for
action and make it possible to add an international
dimension to a great deal of what is undertaken nationally.
The majority of international bodies, both non-govern¬
mental and intergovernmental, have been approached and
have shown great readiness to take part in this aspect of
the International Education Year. The major rôle, however,
will fall to the United Nations itself and the two Specialized
Agencies most directly concerned with education and
training, namely Unesco and the International Labour
Organization.
In preparing the IEY, the guiding principle has been that
of re-orientation: existing staff and on-going projects and
programmes are being pressed into service so that Unesco
may serve its member states by acting as a channel of
communication, and a source of information, guidance and
inspiration.

BUT FOR WHOM? ...AND HOW?
A,IS this century draws to a
close, the developing countries face
their biggest challenge: how to find
the quickest short cut to close the
gap between themselves and the
industrially developed nations.
The development of science and
technology certainly appears to be
the best and most effective way to
bring this about. Man, with his capa¬
city for planning, organization and
innovation, will be the chief driving
force for this radical transformation.
This has been true at all times and
in all countries. Studies in Washington
show that even more important than
investment, the major factor for expan¬
sion in the United States since 1925
has been the education and training of
men and women.
But in trying to apply this to the
developing Third World we are imme¬
diately faced by a host of situations
which though they may appear inde¬
pendent one of the other are in reality
closely interlinked.
The French sociologist Jean Four-
astié has rightly said that "A child
whose life has been dominated by a
fanatical or highly emotional upbring¬
ing, or more important by the belief
in magic and other misguided tenets,
will in all probability find it much
harder to understand the methods of
experimental science much less to
apply them."
The Director-General of Unesco,
René Maheu, recently declared: "The
absence of intellectual stimulation
arising from a lack or insufficiency of
education... inevitably results... in a
slowing down of the mental process.
We know, furthermore, that forms of
mental retardedness can no longer be
overcome if certain learning pro¬
cesses... have not been mastered at
an appropriate age."
The U.N. Advisory Committee on
the Application of Science to Develop¬
ment reports: "If the levels of teaching
in the majority of the developing
countries cannot be considerably
improved and raised so that the
appreciation of modern science and
technology becomes a major factor,
there is little chance of science and
technology being effectively applied in
these countries."
We thus see that the logical
conclusions to be drawn are these:
without short cuts the developing
countries cannot possibly catch up;
PIERRE RONDIERE, French writer and
journalist, is the author of "Rendez-vous
1980 - La science et la technique au se¬
cours du tiers monde" (Science and Tech¬
nology to Aid the Third World), published
in collaboration with the United Nations by
Editions Payot, Paris, 1968 (7.50 F).
without the application of science and
technology no short cuts are concei¬
vable; and without education the
application of science and technology
is impossible. So without education
there can be no short cuts.
But that is not all. The question that
immediately comes to mind is: educ¬
ation, fine, but for whom, and how?
For the past 20 years, the nations
of the Third World both the govern¬
ments and the people have launched
out into a vast fight to overcome
illiteracy and raise their educational
level. Three entire continents have
been caught up in the fever.
In 1960, the governments of Asia
adopted the now-famous "Karachi
Plan" which foresaw seven years of
compulsory primary schooling for all
children by 1980.
In 1961, African Ministers of Educa-
by Pierre Rondière
tion agreed to an ambitious pro¬
gramme with three main objectives:
six years compulsory education for all
African children by 1980; entry of
20 per cent of primary school children
into secondary schools; a university
enrolment of 300,000 students.
The countries of Latin America
followed suit in 1962 with their own
plan to provide six years of primary
schooling for all children throughout
the continent by 1970.
Education budgets in the Third
World have thus spiralled upwards at
a dizzy pace since 1960 about twice
as fast as the increase in national
income.
The effort made by the less well
off countries has been and remains
today so intense that most of them,
despite their poverty, devote a higher
CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE
In many countries
of the Third World,
the immense effort
to develop education
is hardly keeping
pace with the effects
of the population
explosion. In Mali,
for instance,
68,000 children
attended primary
school in 1961; three
years later this figure
was almost
double113,000.
But, as in 1961, it
still represented -
only 10 per cent
of Mali's school age
population. In many
countries, the
number of children
for whom there is no
room in the
classroom Is rising
every day.

proportion of their national income to
education than do the developed
countries. The figure is often as high
as 25 per cent and sometimes even
higher, compared, for example, with
France's 17 per cent.
Expenditure on education in all
these countries has risen faster than
other budget spending. It has, in fact,
been pointed out that public funds
devoted to education cannot go on
much longer increasing faster than
those earmarked for other national
needs without jeopardizing government
targets in other fields.
And here a difficult decision must
be faced: the choice between more
schools and fewer hospitals, factories,
fertilizers, roads and dams, or fewer
schools than planned and more hos¬
pitals, factories, fertilizers, roads,
dams and illiterates.
Education certainly, but for whom?
In their attempt to respond both to
the intense desire for learning and to
the need for education as a means to
progress, the governments of the three
"hungry continents" have adopted
various solutions which can be roughly
divided into two groups.
In the first group of countries,
essentially the African countries, pri¬
mary education has been made available
to all. Since the number of qualified
student teachers leaving the training
colleges is insufficient to deal with
such a situation, use is made of
relatively unqualified "monitors"
pupils who failed the secondary
school entry examination or who
simply hold a primary school leaving
certificate.
Thus in the Ivory Coast, for exam¬
ple, only 600 of the 7,500 primary
school teachers hold diplomas, while
the proportion of "monitors" in primary
education elsewhere in French-
speaking Africa is between 70 and
80 per cent, and as high as 90 per cent
in Chad.
The result, in certain countries, is
that five years after their primary
schooling these so-called literate
young men and women have once
again become illiterates.
Broadly speaking, the system works
as follows. The "monitor" has his
class of 50, 60, 80 or even 100 children
recite in chorus from a textbook,
whose contents they scarcely under¬
stand. Since selection for promotion
to a higher grade is stiff, pupils who
do not succeed stay on in the lower
grade for a second, third and some¬
times even a fourth year before finally
dropping out.
They form what specialists call
"the wall", and progressively para¬
lyze an already weak educational sys¬
tem. As the pupils chant their daily
lessons, "the wall" forms a kind of
chorus, reducing to silence the more
recent arrivals, even if these children
are more gifted. On average only 10
to 20 per cent of the pupils in these
classes of 100 children manage to
pass into the next grade without
staying on for a second year.
The educational wastage is conse¬
quently enormous. Mr. Amon Tanoh,
Education Minister of the Ivory Coast,
has stated that "out of 10,000 children
entering primary school in any given
year, 3,900 reach the next grade, more
than half of this number after remain¬
ing in the lower grade for a second or
third year.
About 30 per cent of the initial
group reach the first-year of the inter¬
mediate classes and about 20 per cent
the second year, most of them after
seven, eight or ten years at school.
Of the 10,000 who entered the first
grade, only 1,585 less than one-sixth
obtain their primary school leaving
certificate.
Despite the crushing financial bur¬
den shouldered by these needy coun¬
tries, the returns are very low.
The second group of countries can
be said, with a few notable exceptions,
to take in Asia, Latin America and the
Middle East. Here the educational
system works quite differently. A
large proportion of children are still
not accepted for primary school educ¬
ation, but the great majority of those
who are finally pass out with a certi¬
ficate of secondary education.
For these privileged children educ¬
ation starts at the age of six and

DROPOUTS
AND
REPEATERS
Recent experience has
revealed some of the pitfalls
which have beset the
developing countries in their
eagerness to expand and
modernize education. The
enormous amount of wastage
in education and the high
proportion of children who
stay in the same grade for
two or more years is due,
among other causes, to the
lack of qualified teachers. In
some parts of Africa, out
of six children entering
primary school, only one
obtains a leaving certificate.
In the Industrially developed
countries, where in many
cases the number of
would-be university students
doubles every six or
seven years, wastage in
education is also a problem
but to a far lesser degree.
These photos symbolize
the two aspects
of the problem.
Photo University of Rochester, N.Y., U.S A.
finishes at 18. Students pass without
much difficulty from one grade to the
next, and the final certificate at the
close of this easy-going school life is
generously awarded.
In this second group of countries
the dominant factor is obviously the
extension of secondary education. In
Mexico, primary education has increas¬
ed by about 50 per cent since 1955,
while secondary education has risen
by 300 per cent. Similar trends are
to be seen in several Asian countries.
Educators call this type of educational
system "porous" or "open".
A Teheran university professor has
this to say about it: "The quality of
education is worse than weak.
Secondary schools accept all candi¬
dates, even the most mediocre. I know
teachers with 70 students or even
more, who become so discouraged
that they have given up teaching their
classes. University entrants have
been so badly taught that I have even
seen students writing out their English
language lessons phonetically in Ara¬
bic script. With such an open second¬
ary education we will never form an
active elite."
However harsh the conclusion, it
would be wrong to conceal it: whether
because of educational "wastage" or
the "porousness" of school systems,
education in the Third World today is
turning out few teen-agers who tomor¬
row will be able to work for the
development of their homelands, and
even fewer who will be able to take
full advantage of the possibilities
offered by science and technology.
Education certainly, but how?
How has this situation come about?
First there has been the population
explosion, the effects of which were
calculated either inaccurately or not
at all. The result has been a general
rise in school enrolment. In Mali, for
example, ten per cent of children aged
between six and 14 a total of 68,000
went to school in 1961. Three years
later, in 1964, the proportion of the
same age group in school was still
ten per cent but the figure had almost
doubled, to 113,000.
Since Algeria's independence in
1962 the number of pupils has more
than doubled in the primary schools,
from 600,000 to 1,400,000; more than
tripled in the secondary schools, from
35.000 to 110,000; and increased more
than ten times in higher education,
from 600 to 7,000. What budget could
be expected to support such a spiral
indefinitely and at the same time to
provide for the training of qualified
staff at all levels?
The second factor has been a
reversal of the process by which educ¬
ation has extended in the past. Up
to now, whether in Europe, the United
States, the Soviet Union or Japan,
industrialization has always preceded
education, even in periods when the
birth rate fell.
In today's developed countries
there were for a long time more fac¬
tories than schools, and industry finan¬
cially supported the education which
was to provide it with urgently needed
qualified workers. Yet even so it took
Europe more than a century in this way
to provide primary education for all its
children.
In the developing countries, however,
schools are opening before the factor¬
ies in a period when the birth rate is
increasing and when man's knowledge
particularly in the fields of science
and technology is growing twenty,
fifty, or a hundredfold. Difficulties as
serious as the problem we are consid¬
ering here were bound to follow once
the decision had been made to launch
such an ambitious programme as the
introduction of universal education
within 20 years.
Do these difficulties mean that the
programme must be abandoned and
all hope of its achievement given up?
Certainly not. Should the developing
countries, then, base their approach
on the European model and wait an¬
other century before the children of
the three continents can find their
place in school? Even less so:
imitation would be no solution. Educ¬
ation remains a basic necessity, but
the experience of recent years puts
the question into a new perspective:
"for whom and how?"
The essence of the solution is to
link quantity and quality, and to find

The developing countries are now
fully aware of the pitfalls into which
their early enthusiasm led them, but
they are not giving up in despair.
They are facing the problem squarely
and courageously.

_ EVERAL states have al¬
ready abandoned the principle of eight
years' obligatory schooling. Laos has
reduced the period to three years.
Dahomey has decided not to increase
the number of pupils at its primary
schools over the next few years.
The government of Tanzania has
agreed to restrict the number of chil¬
dren receiving schooling to 49 per
cent, the level attained in 1964.
George Skorov, the Soviet economist,
and formerly a specialist at the Inter¬
national Institute for Educational
Planning, set up by Unesco, has
commented: "This was a very difficult
political decision because it means
that half of each age group will help
to swell the ranks of the illiterate, who
already represent 85 per cent of men
and 96 per cent of women over the
age of 15."
Morocco envisages another solution:
to accept an increasing number of
six-year-olds but to eliminate pro¬
gressively the less gifted.
Algeria has decided to prune the
final primary grades of second-and
third-year stayers by imposing an age
limit of 13 for secondary school entry.
Nigeria, in an attempt to raise the
quality of her secondary education, is
to allow only 15 per cent of those who
have finished their primary education
to go on to secondary schools: last
year 1,000 out of 3,000 candidates
were admitted.
In Algeria over the same period,
22 per cent were admitted compared
with 70 per cent the previous year.
It is interesting to note, in passing,
that this approaches the figure in
France in 1939, when 20 per cent of
children were in secondary schools.
Finally there has been a major move
to solve the essential problem of
improving the qualification of teaching
staff: Algeria, Ivory Coast and Daho¬
mey have stopped recruiting "moni¬
tors". Today only certificate-holders
are admitted as teachers in these
countries. This is the same decision
that France took in the nineteenth cen¬
tury for its primary education.
Already a start is being made to
answering the question: "education,
but for whom?"
At the request of numerous govern¬
ments, Unesco has replied to the
second part of the question "educ¬
ation, but how?" by concentrating
much of its effort on the improvement
of the status and professional quali¬
fications of teachers.
In Latin America, Unesco, in associ¬
ation with the universities of Sao Paulo
(Brazil) and Santiago (Chile), has
trained 400 candidates in educational
administration and educational and
vocational guidance. It has also sent
experts to work at the continent's five
major teacher training colleges Pam¬
plona (Colombia), San Pablo del Lago
(Ecuador), Jinotepe and San Marcos
(Nicaragua), and Tegucigalpa (Hondu¬
ras). In two years 1,600 trainee
teachers have taken experimental
courses at the colleges using new.
methods which will in future be
extended throughout the rest of these
countries.
Unesco has also helped to organize
40 study courses and round table
discussions aimed at improving teach¬
ing methods and at providing teachers
in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Salva¬
dor, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua, and
Peru with opportunities for in-service
training. At the Inter American Centre
in Venezuela, problems affecting
teaching in rural areas have been
studied with Unesco's help.
In Africa, Unesco and the U.N. Dev¬
elopment Programme have helped to
set up teacher training colleges in
Mali, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and the
Congo; and some 30 African countries
benefit from the advice of Unesco
specialists.
IHE necessity for finding
short cuts within the educational
system is one of the themes taken up
by the United 'Nations Consultative
Committee on the Application of
Science and Technology to Develop¬
ment. It is also a matter of concern
to the developing countries themselves,
and a major preoccupation of Unesco.
As Prof. Thomas Balogh, of Oxford
University, has pointed out, to imitate
blindly the systems practised in the
industrially developed part of the
world would be at once an error and
a danger.
In this connexion, and as part of a
pilot project to explore new methods
for teaching physics best suited to the
needs and teaching situation in Latin
America, Unesco brought together for
one year 26 teachers from universities
and pedagogical institutes in eight
Latin American countries. These spe¬
cialists compiled five programmed
instruction texts, eight inexpensive
laboratory kits, and 12 short silent
films as well as a half-hour sound film
as part of the course on "The Physics
of Light"
A similar pilot project for chemistry
teaching in Asia has been set up under
Unesco's auspices, and others are
under way in Africa on the teaching
of biology and in. the Arab states on
mathematics.
Increasingly important is the work
of other U.N. Specialized Agencies,
among them the Food and Agricul¬
ture Organization, the World Meteoro¬
logical Organization, the World Health
Organization and the International
Labour Organization, who are multi¬
plying their efforts, whether in agricul¬
ture or meteorology, medicine or the
training of qualified workers, to raise
the standards of all forms of education
in the impoverished countries.
BIUT these combined efforts,
even with the help of bilateral aid pro¬
grammes now operating between many
countries, do not meet even half the
present needs.
By 1980 the school population of the
Third World will have risen from its
present total of 400 million to 600 mil¬
lion. It has also been estimated that
if these countries are to attain the
point of economic "take-off", they
will need 900,000 semi-skilled techni¬
cians (four times as many as today)
and 600,000 engineers and scientific
specialists (compared with 150,000
today), not to mention agronomists,
administrators, accountants or doctors.
Where is the capital to be found to
train teachers and educate children,
to build schools and universities? It
is abundantly clear that unless the
more prosperous industrialized nations
make a greater effort in this respect,
the developing nations will not begin
to free themselves of their impoverish¬
ment by 1980. The gap between dev¬
eloped and developing countries will
remain. Inevitably the first step
towards closing that gap is to raise
the level of education.
In 1967, Robert McNamara, at that
time U.S. Secretary of Defense, and
today President of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Develop¬
ment, summed up the problem of the
three gaps economic, technological
and educational when he declared:
"If the wealthy nations of the world
do not do more to close this sundering
economic split which cleaves the
planet, none of us will ultimately be
secure. The seismic social shocks
will reach us all, and with them will
come the inevitable tidal of waves of
violence. The widening economic
chasm between the rich nations and
the poor nations can be as threatening
to our security as the emergence of
nuclear weapons. It is as simple and
it is as sobering as that.

Hi
The race between
education & catastrophe
I UMAN history becomes
more and more a race between educa¬
tion and catastrophe," wrote H.G. Wells
nearly fifty years ago in his "Outline
of History". And if in 1920, when
they were written, these words were
dismissed by many as being an in¬
defensible exaggeration, today they
are widely accepted as axiomatic.
The immense growth in man's pro¬
ductive capacity during the twentieth
HOWARD BRABYN is an English writer
and journalist who has specialized in popu¬
larizing scientific and educational questions.
century, and particularly since the end
of World War II, has brought with
it the realization that ignorance, poverty
and disease can be eliminated. Now
the underprivileged two-thirds of the
world's 3,630,000,000 inhabitants are
insisting on action.
Pressure for educational opportunity,
therefore, now comes not only from
an enlightened minority who see
education as a means of producing
the highly-qualified manpower and
mentally alert citizens that national
interest demands, but increasingly
from the uneducated masses them¬
selves.
"Everyone born into this world has
a natural right to education," declared
Horace Mann, and the people of the
world are clamouring for fulfillment of
this right. The "catastrophe" of which
H.G. Wells spoke will occur if they
are denied their educational rights,
either as part of a deliberate policy
or as a result of a failure to under¬
stand the size and urgency of the
effort needed.
Comparative studies on education
have been primarily concerned with
differences in structure, content and
method. While there is a vast amount
to be learnt from such studies they
cannot tell us anything about the size
of the educational effort being made.

BETWEEN EDUCATION AND CATASTROPHE (Continued)
They tell us only something about the
quality of that effort-
But details of the financial effort
made between 1950 and 1965 by a
large sample of countries have been
gathered by the Unesco Office of
Statistics (1). Although it is important
to stress the need for the utmost
caution in making interpretations of
statistics such as these, they do at
least allow us to distinguish broad
trends in expenditure on education.
The dominant feature which emerges
from a study of the data collected by
Unesco Is the increase, both in ab¬
solute terms and in relation to total
national spending, in expenditure on
education. The increase was most
pronounced in the period 1960 to 1965,
with the proportion of the national in¬
comes of a group of 90 countries spent
on education rising from 3.6 per cent
in 1960 to 4.5 per cent in 1965.
Translated into human terms, this
increase represents a very consider¬
able achievement. The total world
school enrolment at the three main
levels of education primary, secon¬
dary and higher education was
estimated at 324 million pupils for
the school year 1960-61 (excluding
mainland China, North Korea and North
Vietnam for which no recent figures
are available). The corresponding
figure for 1966-67 was 428 million, an
increase of 104 million, or 32 per cent,
in six years.
Total school enrolment has increas¬
ed at an average annual rate of 4.8
per cent whereas world population has
increased annually by 1.9 per cent.
The fast growth in school enrolment
reflects the progress made in develop¬
ing countries towards generalizing
primary education. Although* a smaller
proportion of total population attends
school in Africa and Asia, these two
continents registered the highest aver¬
age annual rate of increase in enrol¬
ment during the period in question.
Great strides have been made in
granting girls and women the educa¬
tional rights they have for so many cen¬
turies been denied. It now seems in¬
credible that in ancient China it was
a commonplace that "a woman with¬
out ability is normal", that Sophie, in
Rousseau's Emile, was given a moral
rather than an intellectual education,
and that Napoleon founded a school
for girls at Ecouen in 1807 to turn out
"women who believe, not women who
think."
Recent years have seen a sweep¬
ing away of these taboos. Enrolment
of girls and women at all three educa¬
tional levels has increased from 140
million in 1960-61 to 186 million in
1966-67, a 33 per cent increase. The
percentage of girls and women out
of total enrolment was estimated at
43 per cent for 1966-67, the same level
as for 1960-61. But in Africa, the
percentage of girls and women enrol¬
led increased from 35 per cent in
1960-61 to 38 per cent in 1966-67 and
in Asia from 37 per cent to 38 per cent.
Despite George Bernard Shaw's
disparaging remark that "those who
can, do; those who can't, teach," the
extent to which the demand for educa¬
tion can be met and the quality of
the education given depends largely
upon the numbers of teachers available
and the ratio of teachers to pupils.
The use of teaching machines, tele¬
vision and other audio-visual aids has
not, as yet, become a significant
factor.
It has been estimated that there were
some 17 million teachers for 428 mil¬
lion students in primary, secondary
and higher education in 1966-67. The
world average annual growth in teach¬
ing staff since 1960-61 has been cal¬
culated at 3.9 per cent.
However, total world enrolment of
pupils has increased faster than the
number of teachers, giving slight
increases in the pupil/teacher ratio
which stood at 31 pupils to 1 teacher
at primary level in 1966-67 as compar¬
ed with 30 to 1 in 1960-61. At sec¬
ondary school level the average was
19 pupils to 1 teacher in 1966-67 as
compared with 16 to 1 in 1960-61.

tional Expenditure: 1950-1965" by Friedrich
Edding and Dieter Berstecher (Unesco Statis¬
tical Reports and Studies), 1969 ($2,00, 12/-).
.VIDENCE of the overall
educational effort being made, even in
countries where first level education is
still the prime concern, is the signi¬
ficant increase in enrolment in higher
education. In 1966-67, 73 per cent of
total world enrolment was at the
primary level, 23 per cent at the
secondary level and 4 per cent at the
higher level.
Africa has the highest rate of increase
among the continents with percentage
increases of 41 per cent, 84 per cent,
and 74 per cent for the first, second
and third levels respectively. Equally
noticeable is the development of higher
education in Asia, particularly in female
enrolment, where the highest growth
rate for any continent was registered.
Statistical tests, based on an
analysis of the main causal factors
behind the international development
of educational expenditure, show three
factors to be dominant the national
income, the size of the age group
corresponding to different levels of
education and the proportion of highly
qualified manpower in the active
population.
In most countries these factors tend
to have an increasingly strong influence
on future educational expenditure.
Other influences, in particular the de¬
mand for equal opportunities and the
drive for qualitative improvements in
formal education, are likely to give
further impetus to the expansion of
educational budgets.
Many of the forecasts of educational
expenditure, however, are based on
wrong premises. There is a tendency
to assume that all nations will have to
follow a pre-determined path of dev¬
elopment. International expenditure
comparisons tend to lead to the per¬
petuation of past expenditure pat¬
terns. At a time when great changes
in curricula, techniques and organiza¬
tion are in the offing, comparisons bet¬
ween national expenditures become
less and less meaningful.
The strong interdependence between
expenditure on education and on other
public needs suggests that education
should be planned as an integral part
of the overall national effort. Instead
of making invidious international com¬
parisons, it is more important, perhaps,
to compare the proportion of the total
national product devoted to education
with that devoted to other public needs.
When this sort of comparison is made
it appears distressingly obvious that

mLOBAL expenditure for military purposes has
reached a new record high. In 1967, the military spending
of the world's nations totalled $182,000 million dollars,
according to "World Military Expenditures, 1966-1967," the
findings of a recent survey of 120 countries carried out
by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in
co-operation with other U.S. government agencies and
several international bodies, including Unesco and WHO.

our values have become distorted and
that, in most countries, education is
receiving a very meagre slice of the
national cake.
In the time it takes to read this sen¬
tence eleven children will have been
born into the world. In the same
period of time five people will have
died. The terrifying demographic ex¬
plosion the world is now experiencing
gives a measure of the staggering size
of the education, food and health prob¬
lems with which we are faced.
D,'ESPITE the efforts enum¬
erated above, the number of adult
illiterates in the world has probably
increased in the last ten years from
740 million to something like 800 mil¬
lion. Unless an enormously enlarged
effort is made this progression will
continue.
Since in education lies the key to
the solution of such problems as birth
control, improved food production, bet¬
ter elementary hygiene, etc., we must
concentrate our resources upon its
furtherance. Only through education
can we de-fuse the population "bomb"
which, in the long run, may represent
a greater threat to our planet than
nuclear weapons. How far we are
failing in this task becomes evident
when we learn that the world as a
whole is spending about 40 per cent
more on military programmes than on
public education (see next page).
Not only must the world change its
expenditure priorities; in the field of
education it must re-define its objec¬
tives. At the primary level instruction
in hygiene and feeding habits must
be regarded as equally important as
instruction in reading and writing. Uni¬
versities in the developing countries
must direct students towards those
studies that bear a close relationship
to the needs of the country in its exist¬
ing state of development. It is less
important to provide a minority with
a maximum of culture than to arm the
majority with a basic minimum of
knowledge.
"Take some more tea," the March
Hare said to Alice.
"I've had nothing yet," Alice replied,
"so I can't take more."
"You mean you can't take less,"
said the Hatter: "It's very easy to take
more than nothing." (Lewis Carroll)
There is no room for complacency
about results already achieved. If the
world is to emerge from its present
"Alice-in-Wonderland" situation, we
must offer the uneducated masses
much more than the "nothing", or next
to nothing, they have been receiving
up to now. A massive, no-expenses-
spared, educational effort must be
undertaken immediately. In less than
a generation it may be too late.

WORLD ARMAMENTS (Continued)
Startling findings from a world
survey on arms expenditure
The world spends 40 per cent more on armaments
than on public education: $159,000 million for milita¬
ry budgets; $1 1 1 ,000 million for public education.
Average annual expenditure per soldier, world-wide,
is $7,800. Average public expenditure for edu¬
cation is $100 annually per child for the estimated
1,000 million young people in the world school-age
population (ages 5-19).
Developed countries spend a much higher pro¬
portion of their gross national product on public
education (5 per cent) than do the less-developed
countries (3 per cent).
The less developed countries have 72 per cent of
the world's population, but public expenditure on
education is only 11 per cent of world expenditure.
The less developed countries spend an average of
$5 per capita annually for education as compared
to an average of $100 per capita in the developed
countries.
Of the $44,000 million increase in world military
spending from 1965 to 1967, the United States and
the Soviet Union made up almost three-fourths
of the world total.
Compared with 1962," when the United Nations estimated
world spending on arms at 120,000 million dollars, there
has been an increase of more than 50 per cent. If this
trend continues, arms expenditure will consume the astro¬
nomic sum of 4 billion dollars (or 4 trillion dollars in Ame¬
rican usage: $4,000,000,000,000) over the next 10 years.
It is almost impossible to explain what these staggering
figures mean in terms comprehensive to the ordinary man
in the street, but an attempt is made in the graphic presen¬
tation published opposite. It shows that if a coin were
dropped every second, it would take 5,750 years for the last
coin to drop for the 182,000 million dollars spent in 1967 on
armaments, and 126,000 years for the last coin to drop for
the sum of $4,000,000,000,000 likely to be spent on arms in
the next 10 years.
Or to put it another way, if the coins 2 è millimetres in
thickness are piled flat one on top of the other: they would
reach all the way to the moon and extend beyond it by
71,000 kilometres just for the amount spent by the world
on military matters in 1967. For military expenditure in
the next 10 years at the rate we are going, the pile of
coins would rise ten million kilometres into space, or
30 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.
The world is now spending more money on military
affairs than at any period except the peak fighting years
of World War II, and this represents 7 per cent of the
world's gross product. This is equivalent to the total
annual income of the 1,000 million people in the countries of
Latin America, South Asia and the Near East combined.
During 1964-1967 military spending increased faster than
world population growth (by 7 per cent) and much faster
than the growth of the world's gross product (16 per cent).
Japan spends more than 4 times as much on edu¬
cation as on military services. Canada twice as
much. Other developed countries which spend
more on education than on military programmes:
Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands. Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland.
Many countries spend large sums on privately-
financed education and health in addition to public
funds for these purposes. Private spending on
education in the U.S.A. is estimated at $7,000 million
compared with public expenditures of $34,000 mil¬
lion. But total U.S. figure for education is less
than two-thirds the size of its military budget.
The developing countries did not escalate their
military spending as much as the industrially de¬
veloped nations in the period 1964-1967, Their ave¬
rage military outlay per capita was $8 (as against
an average of $170 in the developed countries).
But since the standard of living is low in these
countries, with an average per capita G.N. P. of
$186, even a diversion of $8 per capita for military
purposes represents a very heavy burden.
The world total of about $8,000 million in econo¬
mic aid to the developing nations is less than one-
half of 1 per cent of the gross national product
of the donor countries.
Aid to the developing countries averaged $8 per
capita in the developed countries as compared to
$170 per capita spent on military programmes.
1 l\ Military expenditures of the less developed nations
were more than twice as large as their receipts
of foreign economic aid.

PUR world is falling apart,
but there is much disagreement as to
why, how and even where. For some
people the Western industrialized
world is the "sick man" of present-day
society. For the Socialist countries
of Eastern Europe no such crisis
apparently exists. In the Third World
the whole context is different. Yet,
everywhere we seem to be witnessing
a parallel process of corrosion
irrespective of the terminology used.
In the Western countries there is no
mistaking the unrest among youth.
The revolts and uproar in the uni¬
versities, the political involvement or
the total disinterest in political matters,
the hippy movements, the increasing
permissiveness and eroticism ... all
point to a deep-rooted disorder in
modern society and the yearning for
a new pattern of civilization.
Sooner or later the explosion was
bound to come from within the world
of education where the present "mal
du siècle" was first discussed among
a few individuals and then was taken
up by whole clusters of dissatisfied
youth, and finally burst out in its
violent upheavals in the universities of
Japan (Tokyo), the U.S.A. (Berkeley,
Columbia), Europe (Rome, Paris) and
elsewhere.
For the Socialist countries, no such
problem would seem to exist. But if
nothing happens in broad daylight can
we be sure that nothing is really going
on behind the scenes? The answer is
a very tricky one. As a matter of fact,
no one can deny that the Socialist
ideologies took a head start in meeting
the challenge of the 20th century.
Their concept of the world includes
both international solidarity and the
active involvement of the individual in
his community the two critical points
of the crisis experienced by other
countries.
But since political reality does not
always go hand in hand with ideology,
the idea of solidarity often comes a
cropper when it meets up with big
power strategy. Then even the best
intentions fly out the window. The

OF TOMORROW -
TOWARDS
A NEW GLOBAL HORIZON
by René Habachi
resulting frustation, therefore, is not
so far different from the dissatisfaction
found in Western countries.
As for the developing countries, the
crises they are going through obviously
stem from different causes, even
though outwardly they may seem the
same. Here, in a sense, the social
and economic situation is perhaps
most out of balance. Modern ways
superimposed on traditional attitudes
have had a double appeal and created
a double emotional shock.
Traditional ways though outmoded,
are struggling hard to survive in these
developing nations. The abrupt intro¬
duction of modern techniques has
brought with it echoes of the tensions
from abroad, though this inner conflict
seems to have been overlooked by
most sociologists. As a result the
impact of development aid has been
considerably reduced. The reaction
of many Africans to the modem ways
of today is psychologically different
from that of a young person in the
West, and has other shock wave
effects.
And so, for everyone, the world
around us does seem to be breaking
apart. Whatever the local scene, the
overall picture is ridiculous and hard
to fathom. All over the world young
people have a feeling of being
uprooted, of a world in disorder where
cracks are appearing in every corner
of the globe and spreading and
spreading to create a deep chasm of
demoralization.
"Something is rotten in the State of
Denmark," Hamlet said. Later, when
he looked out onto the absurdity of
the world, he exclaimedl
"The time is out of joint. O cursed
[spite
That even I was born to set it right."
A cursed spite, perhaps, but oh, how
excitingl What better time than this
to be alive.
Yes, time is out of joint. A whirl¬
wind of youth is battering at the doors
that adults have barred and barricaded.
But young people today are wasting no
time over the dilemma of "to be or
not to be". They have made their
choice and are living their lives in
ways their elders had not foreseen.
The world's population is certainly
a most important factor here. Mankind
has attained a new age. Not only
because we are on the verge of an
extraordinary transformation, as in. all
great periods of history, but also
literally, because mankind has become
younger both physically and mentally.
More than half the world's population
today is under 25. If we consider that
the other half includes many old people
whose lives have been prolonged by
modern science but who represent the
past rather than the future, one thing
strikes us: for every adult alive there
are now three young persons. Never
in history has the world known such
a youthful population.
Sons have argued with their fathers
from time immemorial, but in the past,
these arguments, while often sharp and
even bitter at times, have usually been
settled when the older generation
accepted the new ways and changed
their thinking. But today things have
taken a much more dangerous turn
and we are on the verge of a complete
break. There are even those who
claim that the break has already come,
and that barring a miracle, it can only
gain momentum.
w HAT in heaven's name has
happened? The fact is we are living
in a "paradox" world, or to put it
another way, literally a "revolting"
world, where the new society which
is overwhelming civilization has been
created by the older generation itself.
But the older generation is paralyzed
by routine and fear, and stubbornly
refuses to relinquish control. Instead
of taking advantage of what they
themselves have created, and pushing
ahead boldly on the new path they
have set, they have stopped dead in
their tracks.
What are the important features that
characterize the new society? I would
point to three: First, the shrinking of
space, second, the speed of communi¬
cations and third, the pangs of inter¬
national solidarity.
I need not dwell on the first two,
since so much has already been
written on them. From now on, the
limits of the Earth are those of outer
space where national frontiers are
meaningless. Viewed from the moon,
our planet is a tiny island lost in an
ocean of light-years.
No less extraordinary than this new
vision of space is the way electronic
communications now link us instantly
to the most distant events. The tele¬
communication satellite now brings the
furthest continent closer to us on our
TV screen than our next-door neigh¬
bours. Here we are no longer in the
realm of the abstract written word,
but in direct contact with the image
with its full colour and on the spot
sound. The "Gutenberg Galaxy", to
borrow Marshall McLuhan's phrase,
has been replaced by the "television
medium", and the whole physical
universe in its infinite variety is now
brought before our eyes and senses,
thereby making everyone of us
suddenly aware that we are all citizens
of one nation-planet Earth.
That is why the third point inter¬
national solidarity has taken on such
vital importance today. Recognizing
himself as a planetary being, man has
at the same time acquired a global
conscience, or as Jacques Berque and
other sociologists have put it a new
"worldliness". How petty all the
quarrels of rival blocs now appear.
How futile and ominous the haggling
over political frontiers. How ana¬
chronistic the grab mentality that
makes men like children clutching
their toys deny to others the riches
which belong to all mankind. But
despite all these squabblings, a wave
of feeling is sweeping across our
planet in search of world unity.
Nature is retreating before the
onslaught of industry, just as outer
space is being vanquished by modern
technology. But modern technology,
though it is merging and blending
different societies, is reducing the
individual to faceless anonymity. In
sharp contrast to this, the young
people of today are asserting their
own individuality in no uncertain terms,
claiming the right to build their own
future and the world of tomorrow.
As a group of students at Columbia
University recently told me, they
cannot accept that a society capable
of governing itself should use its
power, with cold impersonality, to
control the destiny of everyone.
One can well understand, therefore,
the reasons for the recent assault
against the education system. Certain

THE STUDENT OF TOMORROW (Continued from page 17)
The mirror-image of a crumbling society
modifications and innovations have
been introduced, it is true, but even
these already appear old fashioned
and out-of-date. Education has simply
failed to adapt itself to the tempo of
our changing world. "It advances
towards the future while fixing its eyes
on the past in a rear-view mirror," as
McLuhan has aptly put it.
Today the real need is not so much
just to define the aims of education as
to find new methods to make education
more effective. Aims and methods
are so closely interdependent that if
the latter are inadequate the former
will automatically suffer. To develop
the spirit of total world-mindedness
implies education of the total man
who, as an individual, is concerned
with the fate of all his fellow men in
this world, without thereby losing
anything of his own personality or
individuality.
To conceive of education as a
broadening of horizons to encompass
the globe means extending it over the
entire life span. Education will no
longer be compressed into the early
years of life but will continue until the
day one dies. This "lifelong educa¬
tion" will mean a reduction of tra¬
ditional teaching programmes in favour
of a constant renewal of learning, for
as long as one remains mentally active.
In this new context, the relative
importance of teaching proper and the
accumulation of knowledge will no
doubt undergo a profound change.
Factual knowledge will take its seat in
the classroom, as it were, while
teaching proper will breathe the
freedom of the open air. A young
student on the one hand and an adult
worker on the other will no longer be
worlds apart when the whole of one's
life time is recognized as an integral
part of education.
I

HIS broadening of the idea
of education will make it much easier
for global thinking and a global
approach to develop and take root.
The school system, with its buildings
and other facilities, will then be viewed
simply as one of several "stop-overs"
in a lifetime of "extra-mural" education,
or better still, of "education abroad".
Why not? Today's so-called cultural
tourism is but a pale, distorted image
of those university caravans of
wandering scholars who each year
now travel from one land to the other,
criss-crossing one another or joining
up for large discussion or study
sessions. As they travel from country
to country they are learning about our
world at first hand instead of from the
abstract teaching of a textbook or the
limited outlook of a teacher.
But will the placing of education onto
a new orbit in itself guarantee that
our entire planet will henceforth come
into our purview? It is equally true
that the whole earth must also be
placed in the mind-orbit of each and
everyone of us. Here modern science,
with its satellites and electronic techno¬
logy, will be able to come into its own,
filling classroom TV screens (they are
rapidly- replacing the lecturer in many
schools) with live pictures, detailed
demonstrations of scientific research,
and concrete examples for the com¬
parative study of different cultures.
By making use of the scientific
method of integrating data we shall
one day be able to eliminate the
nightmare of ever-increasing informa¬
tion now choking the school curriculum.
Not by a senseless hacking and
mangling process of compression but
by producing a new coherent synthesis
of existing data.
..Rere the language of mathematics
will no doubt play a major role, at least
in those fields which lend themselves
to its precision. Those that do not
will increase their effectiveness by the
added use of the live image. In fact,
the very abstraction of mathematics
could be made less abstract and hence
more human by means of the TV screen
which will help to bring the language
of mathematics closer to the living
reality it symbolizes.
So we see that the whole process
of education is undergoing a formidable
change. In the school of tomorrow,
personal initiative will be called upon
as never before in cultural subjects
generally as well as in the choice of
a career. Instead of burdening his
memory with a mass of facts and
details, the student of tomorrow will
store these in his computer, allowing
himself the time and freedom to
analyse the whole, make useful
comparisons and draw appropriate
conclusions.
Programmed instruction permitting
each student to judge and criticize his
(or her) own work, the students of
tomorrow will be able to choose from
among different programmes those
that suit them best. Or else, from a
list of courses proposed by a new-look
type of teacher, the students them¬
selves will decide the length and
category of subjects for study which
previous self examination had indicated
as advisable.
As for vocational guidance, students
will have a clearer picture of their
possibilities through special charts
indicating future openings calculated
on the basis of a flexible plan of
future needs, as well as films showing
the advantages and disadvantages of
a particular career, and the chances
of success.
Tomorrow's younger generation will
not only have a clearer idea of their
own community's progress and its
economic and political directions, but
will be invited to prove their worth by
participating fully in the discussions
and decisions affecting world society
as a whole.
It goes without saying that the
teacher-student relationship will have
changed into one of teamwork, where
the teacher plays the role of leader
rather than that of professor, of agent
for the free circulation of culture
rather than its custodian. Teachers
will continue their research work with
students as co-members of the re¬
search team in a community enterprise.
0 F course, some of the
above may well border on science-
fiction. But we should recognize that
while highly technological societies
tend to increase the areas of anonym¬
ity and depersonalization, progress in
the application of the sciences will
allow a return to greater personal
choice and the creation of new sources
of career opportunities.
Will education thus resolve the
crisis of civilization? This has not
been its purpose. It is helping to find
ways towards a solution, but there can
never really be only one solution.
For education is the mirror-image of a
crumbling society; it can also be the
spark that prepares its reconstruction.
In this sense, it can help to create a
new world of humanism.
And is this not, in the final analysis,
our ultimate objective? We are in
search of a new type of humanism a
world in which men are rooted in their
individual society yet open to the
world, a world in which universality
and individuality are equally preserved.
Up until now, these two notions have
always seemed almost totally in¬
compatible. But perhaps this very
incompatibility is the driving force of
progress just as a difference in water
level can be a source of electric
energy. Except that instead of being
reserved for only a small portion of
the globe, this potential must be
utilized by the world as a whole so
that the world's total energy is per¬
manently released.
Are we so far from Descartes's
dream "to read in the great book of
the world"? Are we so far removed
from the fervour of the Middle Ages
and the men who carved the genesis
of their universe on the walls of their
cathedrals? Not really, except that,
today, this great book must be written
and read by all men, of all religions
and races everywhere and our world
demands that all the people of the
earth join together to forge a single
history.
Perhaps it is precisely to the extent
that we dare to be modern that we are
most faithful to tradition. This faith in
change is mankind's triumphant answer
to the challenge of time. It is the
reconciliation of man with the universe,
and of all men answering the call to
Unity. ma

Are there really
too many teachers?
by John Chesswas
|N these days of striving
for greater and greater productivity in
various kinds o f enterprises, eco¬
nomists point to education as a "labour
intensive" activity, conservative and
slow to adapt itself to modern prac¬
tices. How true is this criticism that
it uses a large quantity of manpower,
and educated and trained manpower
at that?
A simple calculation from data
JOHN CHESSWAS, of Unesco's Depart¬
ment of Planning and Financing of Edu¬
cation, was formerly head of educational
planning in the Uganda Ministry of Edu¬
cation, and a staff member of the
International Institute for Educational Plann¬
ing, in Paris. He is the author of several
books on educational planning, particular
concerning its application to the developing
countries.
concerning countries for which suitable
information is available produces the
ratios between population and teachers
and between total employees and
teachers, about 1965, shown in the
table on page 23.
Thus one could say, for instance,
that in Kenya every 278th person or
every 18th employee is a teacher. To
be sure, there are always some ele¬
ments of doubt in statistical counts and
projections, and difficulties arise from
differences of interpretation of the term
"employee". But even if the figures
in the table are taken as simply indi¬
cative of an order of size, the results
give food for thought.
In developing countries, which have
relatively less developed educational
services, teachers represent only a
small proportion of the population.
Yet in some cases the ratio of wage
earners to total population is also
extremely small. This is particularly
true of the first three countries in the
table (page 23) where teachers thus
represent a sizeable proportion of each
country's wage earners.
Even more interesting, perhaps, is
the situation in the more developed
countries which have a base of com¬
pulsory primary education and a well
developed upper second and higher
level of education as well, and at the
same time a predominantly wage-earn¬
ing economy.
As we see from the table, the two
"space nations", U.S.A. and U.S.S.R.,
come very close to one another, and
within the same range come Canada,

22
Albania, France, Norway, Australia and
New Zealand, the whole forming a
highly significant group. Italy and Ire¬
land follow a little behind, probably
because their educational systems are
somewhat less developed than those
of the main group. Within this limited
group, the United Kingdom, somewhat
surprisingly, has the smallest propor¬
tion of teachers in terms both of total
population and employees.
Generally speaking, about one per¬
son in every hundred and one em¬
ployee in every thirty-five in these
countries is a teacher. But when one
considers the wide range of occupa¬
tions found in such countries, these are
low figures indeed.
Furthermore, there is a widespread
tendency not only for more young
people to enter school, but also for
them to stay there longer. To this
must be added the constant demand
by teachers for smaller classes in
the interests of educational efficiency
and teaching standards, which clearly
means that more teachers are needed
for the same number of students. Com¬
pound these two factors, and educa¬
tion claims an even larger proportion
of the population and of wage-earners.
In countries all over the world the
total cost of education has been rising
at a very fast rate, certainly faster
than national income, and especially
since the Second World War. Some
countries are now spending from six
to seven per cent of their Gross
National Product on education.
It is already being said that the
limit has been reached. This limit
must obviously come at some point for
every country, as education is only one
of numerous activities sharing the
national cake. Yet the prospects des¬
cribed above would push even higher
the fast rising share which education
already demands.
If more and more children are to be
kept in school longer and longer and
how long formal education should last
is itself a debatable question then
perhaps the time has come for a broad
reassessment of current educational
practices. Indeed, to carry the point
to its logical conclusion, the very con¬
cept of "education", recognized as a
universal human right, may be called
in question.
But in this article it is not proposed
to enter into such spheres. Its concern
is solely with educational practices in
relation to the function of the teachers
applying them.
At least one important probability
can be foreseen if present practices
are continued. If education continues
to command the present proportion
of the wage-earning force, or if that
proportion increases, as it well may,
then it will be difficult if not impos¬
sible for a country to pay to such
a large force of middle and high level
manpower, salaries which they will
accept as equitable to their education,
training and status vis-à-vis other
employees of equal standing.
The result will be that in many
countries teaching will stay near or
at the bottom of the popularity poll of
occupations for educated persons. Is
that what we want for our children?
Thus, instead of lowering the
student-teacher ratio by simply reduc¬
ing the size of classes, would it not
be more sensible to seek means of
raising it, without loss of educational
efficiency and standards? This is where
consideration of the new educational
techniques television, radio, program¬
med instruction, and the latest entrant
in the field, computers comes in.

the relative merits of each of these,
or combinations of them, perhaps in¬
corporating mixtures of more conven¬
tional techniques. The present pur¬
pose is to point out that current edu¬
cational practices must be subjected
to scrutiny, and changes in methods
must be sought so as to reduce the
manpower demands of education and
put at the disposal of the teacher more
productive means to help him achieve
his object, at the same time enhancing
his position and status.
This has been done in many spheres,

economists some twenty years ago, in

Whatever means are tried, they must
be subjected to a complete economic
analysis. It is pointless saving money
on teachers if in the process as much
as is saved, or perhaps more, is spent
on the alternative means used to re¬
place them. In some cases, in fact,
it has been shown that the same
number of teachers is still required, so
that the cost of the new technique
becomes an additional burden. It may
be found that a saving made on the
number of teachers employed is can¬
celled out by the need to employ
other kinds of human skills those of
technicians to maintain the electronic
teaching aids, for instance.
The question of the initial, the main¬
tenance and the depreciation costs of
expensive equipment thus becomes of
crucial importance. So does the need
to see that it is not maltreated. This
raises the question of the maturity,
motivation and responsibility of the
students.

New look
in Soviet schools
by losif Nekhamkin
k

IS the world enters the
1970s under the banner of scientific
and technical progress, the appli¬
cation of this new knowledge has
become the decisive factor in econo¬
mic development.
Formidable changes have taken
place which influence our thinking and
concepts of what criteria to apply to
general education. What should be
taught? How should it be taught?
What should education imply? What
should our schools be like? Educators
in every country are all asking these
questions.
Sociologists, economists, scientists
and statesmen, too, are pondering
these problems, bearing in mind the
needs of tomorrow's citizens, the men
and women who are today infants or
just entering school, but who will be in
the prime of their lives as the twenty-
first century arrives.
By then they will be living in a world
which we today cannot visualize by
any stretch of imagination. Yet
somehow we must decide what kind of
education will help the child of 1970 to
become a responsible citizen thirty
years from now.
In the U.S.S.R., this problem natur¬
ally preoccupies the educator and
also the State itself, which from its
inception has given the highest
priority to public education and
cultural development. Even when civil
war and foreign intervention threatened
the very existence of the newly-estab¬
lished state, at a time of economic
devastation and widespread famine,
Lenin told the First All-Russia Con¬
gress on Education: "Public education
is an inseparable part of the struggle
we are waging."
Today, as in the past, the Soviet
Union gives high priority to public
education, and it need hardly be said
that Soviet education has never stood
still. Like other countries, the U.S.S.R.
has faced complex problems posed by
the need to keep abreast with constant
change and progress.
Formerly these problems were re-

journalist, has specialized in the popula¬
rization of educational, scientific and
technological questions. He is science

monthly published in Moscow.
solved by merely increasing the num¬
ber of subjects and extending the
period of schooling. This simple expe¬
dient, however, no longer works. The
amount of knowledge required for
what is now regarded as a basic edu¬
cation has reached the point where
it can no longer be crammed into even
the tremendously expanded school
programmes of today.
These programmes have required
children to use their minds as vast
storehouses of facts, dates, theorems,
names, experiments, figures and for¬
mulae. And despite this (or more
likely because of it) schools have not
brought home to children the ideas,
interests and needs of the 20th cen¬
tury. Overburdened with the funda¬
mentals of classical education in all
subjects, children have felt much more
like contemporaries of Newton, Lomo-
nosov and Lavoisier than those of
Einstein, Kurchatov and Wiener.
The problem facing Soviet schools,
as well as schools in all industrially
developed countries, was how to im¬
prove the educational system and
bring it in line with the requirements
of scientific, technical and cultural pro¬
gress. It was one whose solution was
beyond the scope of the schools
themselves, since it called for the con¬
certed efforts of educators, psycholo¬
gists, doctors, specialists in every
branch of education, parents, the pub¬
lic in general and scientific and gov¬
ernment organizations.
A Joint Commission of the Academy
of Pedagogical Science and the Acade¬
my of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. was
set up a few years ago to direct this
work. The question was soon being
discussed and hotly debated in spe¬
cialized publications and in the daily
press. Research programmes and
experimental pilot projects in schools
were launched and the views of spe¬
cialists in medicine, psychology, ped¬
agogics, didactics and methodology
were sought.
The research and discussions cen¬
tered on two main questions "teach¬
ing methods" and "the scope and
content of education". In other words,
the search for ways and means that
give full scope to the process of
harmonious all-round development and
offer the best chance of revealing and
stimulating the creative potential of
every child.
This quest, of course, is never end
ing. But today, when programmes
based on the results of pilot-projects
have been tested in hundreds of So¬
viet schools and are now being follow¬
ed by many thousands of children,
it is possible to sum up some of the
salient features of the work achieved
thus far.
In this connexion, I am reminded of
a conversation I had a few years ago
with an American educator, Dr. R. Hall,
after he had visited Soviet schools
and studied the work of Soviet edu¬
cators. He recalled the observation
made over sixty years ago by a distin¬
guished American educator and
psychologist, Dr. Edward L. Thorn-
dyke, who complained that the results

Quite a number of Soviet secondary schools combine general education with training in various
trades and skills to be used by pupils in case they fail their entrance exams to universities. Here,

newest jobscomputer programming.
of pedagogical research were all too
often left on shelves to gather dust, so
that teachers made no use of them and
scientific research had little effect on
the development of educational plans
and programmes.
"In the Soviet Union I have seen the
efforts you are making to establish
close contact between researchers in
the field of education and the teachers
themselves, "Dr. Hall told me." They
work together on practical rather than
theoretical questions, and this working
relationship ensures that the results of
research are applied directly in the
classroom."
This is indeed the case. Academi¬
cian Isaac Kikoin, a leading Soviet
physicist, once told me: "I remember
what a journalist remarked, when he
learned that school courses and text¬
books in physics were being devel¬
oped by four academicians and several
doctors of science. He described our
efforts as an outstanding sacrifice,
bearing in mind the time we spent on
this task at the expense of our own
scientific work."
"But there was no need for the
journalist to praise us so highly," said
Academician Kikoin. "You might say
we were motivated by selfish consid¬
erations rather than a passion for self-
sacrifice. Every scientist is interested
in developing competent successors.
The improvement of our schools is
one of the most effective ways of
accomplishing this."
Many scientific groups like the one
just mentioned are at work in the
U.S.S.R. in Novosibirsk and Moscow,
Kharkov and Kazan, Leningrad and
Kiev, for example. Distinguished
scientists not only lecture, but often
conduct entire courses in secondary
schools. And the experience and
knowledge they contribute to the
drawing up of new school program¬
mes have helped considerably to
raise the standard of general edu¬
cation in the U.S.S.R.
What are these new programmes
and how have they improved edu¬
cation? Firstly there has been a rig-

SOVIET SCHOOLS (Continued)
orous revision and thorough clearing
out of the storehouse of school
knowledge, cluttered with subject
matter accumulated over the centuries.
This process was not one of simply
"whittling down" the volume of mater¬
ial, but primarily of improving general
concepts. As the logic of a scientific
cognition of the world (from the par¬
ticular to the general) is not the same
as the logic of learning about it in
school, the learning process has no
need to duplicate blindly the steps
taken by the original discoverers of
scientific truths.
All reference materials and facts
which did not demand "mental exer¬
cises", but simply memorization were
reduced to a minimum. This has given
school programmes greater maturity:
children are no longer required merely
to memorize and reproduce what is
taught, but to draw logical conclusions
and to have a deeper understanding
of the interdependence of facts and
phenomena.
In this process of "growing up",
schools have not needed to add extra
hours to the programme. The Soviet
school programme (elementary phase
and secondary combined) still totals
11,000 hours as before fully enough,
say educators, for a child to acquire a
thorough background of general edu¬
cation.
Methods and programme structures,
of course, have been revised. The
course on 19th century Russian his¬
tory, formerly covering 25 hours in the
7th form and 30 hours in the 9th
form, is now taught as a 50-hour cour¬
se in the 8th form. The result is a
more in-depth course taught in fewer
class hours.
One sweeping change is the re¬
duction of the elementary phase in
education from a four to a three-year
programme. This new curriculum was
many years in the making and de¬
serves special mention.
One can hardly picture a seven-
year old child confidently working out
algebraic equations on the blackboard.
Yet this is something that can be seen
in the Soviet Union today, not as a
special demonstration by exceptionally
gifted children, but as part of everyday
class work in a number of experimen¬
tal schools.
Research into the learning capaci¬
ty of young children has produced
some surprising results. It turns out
that first year elementary pupils can
master the kind of abstract concepts
that were thought to be within the
reach only of much older children.
The mastery of algebraic abstractions
is a particularly revealing example.
Experiments carried out in Moscow
and in a number of schools in the
Kalinin and Tula regions show that
the learning capacity of first form chil¬
dren today is considerably higher than
that of their predecessors.
It took a great deal of time and effort
to establish this fact scientifically, to
convince many people of its validity
and to apply the results of initial exper¬
iments as actual programmes in sel¬
ected schools. From these studies and
tests came the conclusion that the
existing four-year elementary curri¬
culum could be shortened to three, thus
freeing about 500 hours for the teach¬
ing of systematic courses in such
subjects as science, and making it
possible to reduce the number of
lessons in the secondary programme.
It was primarily to lighten this
heavy work-load the bane of schools
throughout the world that the new
programmes were introduced, as the
U.S.S.R. Minister of Education, Mikhail
Prokofiev has pointed out. As a scho¬
lar and educator, he is well aware that
the lighter study load will give children
opportunities for independent work
and also to follow studies that corres¬
pond to their inclinations and abilities.
The Soviet school programme is
working towards this goal. For the
upper classes, selective courses are
planned which provide laboratory and
practical training in such subjects as
draftsmanship and designing, electrical
and radio engineering, chemical and
mechanical technology, agriculture and
animal husbandry.
In 1967-68, between 40 and 60 per
cent of children enrolled in the 9th and
10th forms throughout the country took
advantage of these selective studies,
and in 516 schools nearly 2,000 new
classes offered specialized courses in
mathematics, physics and chemistry.
The changeover to the new pro¬
gramme, now accomplished in most
of the 206,000 schools in the Soviet
Union, is a challenge to the country's
two and half million teachers. Schools
have been re-equipped and teachers
retrained. Teaching methods have
been enriched with new ideas and
reinforced with modern equipment
television, tape recorders, film projec¬
tors and computers. Soviet pedagog¬
ical specialists have produced text
books and teaching aids specially
adapted to the new programmes.
This nation-wide renovation of
school programmes, based on years of
intensive research, calls for a vast
financial effort by the government to
meet the needs of the nearly 50 million
children now enrolled in Soviet
schools. When we add to this all the
other forms of education provided in
the Soviet Union we find that about
80 million people are engaged in stud¬
ies of one kind or another. This means
that some 300 million textbooks,
published in 47 languages, are needed
every year.
I began by attempting to show what
problems our scientific and technolo¬
gical age has created for schools. To
conclude, I would say that this age can
also help schools in overcoming these
problems. m

EDUCATION PUT
TO THE QUESTION
IT is two hundred years
since Rousseau wrote Em;7e in which
he expressed his stupefaction at the
way men were educated in the mid-
eighteenth century. Was it really
necessary for human beings to adapt
themselves to the educational system?
Would it not be better for the system
to be adapted to the needs of men?
The fundamental question was clearly
stated.
Regularly since then, for each
succeeding generation, the relationship
between education and life has been
the subject of studies, dissertations
PAUL LENGRAND is chief of the Con¬
tinuing Education Section of Unesco's
Department for the Advancement of Edu¬
cation. He has written numerous studies
and articles on adult education and perma¬
nent education, and is the author of "Edu¬
cation Permanente", published by Edition

and experiments. The list of protests,
proposals and projects is endless.
After Jean-Jacques Rousseau came
Jean-Henri Pestalozzi in Switzerland,
Friedrich Froebel in Germany, Bertrand
Russell in England, John Dewey in
the United States, Célestin Freinet in
France, Anton Makarenko in the
Soviet Union, Maria Montessori in
Italy, and dozens of other pioneers
of educational reform.
Nor should we forget all those
philosophers whose first concern also
was the education and development
of man. If we read again the writings
of Friedrich Hegel, Auguste Comte or
Friedrich Nietzsche, we find on every
page a reference to this same preoccu¬
pation how can man, through his
experiences, his thought processes
and his relationships with others,
develop his personality, strive con¬
stantly to improve himself and achieve
real, untrammelled, tangible self-
liberation.
It is true that we have an over¬
abundance of ideological material at
our disposal. But it is evident that
educational theory has only a very
tenuous link with educational practice.
The traditional structures have con¬
stantly exercised a passive, sometimes
even an active, resistance to a trans¬
formation of the educational process
in the interests of both the individual
and society.
Of all human undertakings it
would appear that education is the
one that encounters the greatest
obstacles in the path of progress.
For years institutions known for their
conservatism, such as Churches and
Armies, have been in the throes of
a thorough evolution. National defence
is no longer assured- in the barracks,
but in the laboratories of the scientists.

bishops from all over the world are

EDUCATION PUT TO THE QUESTION (Continued)
The battle between traditional forces and innovation
have joined the ranks of the protesters
and are claiming the right to a share
in decision-making.
Until recently no such evolution has
been apparent in the world of educa¬
tion, at least in the education of
young children and adolescents. It
is true that teaching as practised today
in most advanced countries has made
some progress as compared with the
situation pictured in the biting analyses
and sombre descriptions of Charles
Dickens or Jules Vallès.
Children are no longer whipped.
Their intellects are no longer system¬
atically dulled. They are no longer
obliged to learn by heart the tribut¬
aries of the Rhine or the Thames.
The general moral standard has
progressed and the shock-waves of
a number of decisive advances in
our civilization have been felt in
education.
Generally speaking the integrity of
the child of today, at least physically,
is respected. Up to a certain point
syllabuses and methods have become
more enlightened. But the greater part
remains unaffected.
The means at the disposal of society
for the instruction and training of
future citizens the school and the
university retain the same character¬
istics generation after generation: only
occasional relevance to ordinary life,
lack of awareness of concrete reality,
a divorce between pleasure and learn¬
ing and absence of dialogue and
participation.
I
28
he obstacles in the path of
change are well known. Some even
have considerable justification. There
is a handing down process in educa¬
tion that cannot be ignored. How, other
than through teaching, can the present
generation be linked with its pred¬
ecessors?
It is quite normal and inevitable
that the past, both that of mankind
in general and of each separate
society, should occupy a position of
honour in any body of teaching. It
is a public treasure store and we are
only too well aware of the feeling of
deprivation experienced by those
whose access to their cultural heritage
has been limited.
But this "tradition", precious though
it may be, becomes an obstacle when
it is not allied to a, forward-looking
view of life and when it becomes an
alibi and a pretext for a refusal to give
rein to the interplay of vital currents of
thought. In fact, the whole system,
as now constituted and operated,
produces the obstacle.
Compulsory education, the good
grounds for which no one would
dispute, paralyses innovation. Why
change? Why try to do better? Why
seek for formulae that meet the needs
of evolving man better, when automat¬
ically each year our schools receive
their quota of pupils? The law of
supply and demand, which gives im¬
pulse to progress, does not apply here.
Nor does the teaching profession,
recruited and formed as it now is,
greatly favour an imaginative or invent¬
ive spirit. By very reason of his
profession the teacher, at whatever
level, is never a participant in a
dialogue. He does not have to justify
himself to his equals, but passes, by
way of the examination system from
the statu pupillari to one of full
authority.
Is there any other position in the
world that entails the same concen¬
tration of powers as are in a teacher's
hands? He instructs, he moulds, he
has the advantage of age and know¬
ledge. By definition he is always right.
He is both jury and judge against whom
there is virtually no appeal. He it is
who apportions blame, punishment and
reward.
But, as we are well aware, this is
not the way in which a man becomes
truly adult and achieves his true
fulfilment. If wisdom and the under¬
standing of men and of real-life
situations penetrate at all into this
enclosed little world, it is because,
fortunately, some teachers escape and
make contact with the outside world in
which they face resistance from men
and things the world of politics, art,
community life and of adult education.
For their part, the legal and institut¬
ional authorities' interests are not
served by change nor do they desire
it. What these institutions, whether
the family or the State, are aiming
at through education is the turning out
of men who conform.
Most of the school or university
systems existing today are perfected
instruments for the production of the
type of individual who accepts as
revealed truth the myths and terms of
reference of society. What these
authorities, whoever they may be, fear
is the questioning spirit.
It is this spirit that produces the
independent son, the democratically-
minded citizen, in short, the adult
human being who, by definition, is far
from docile, difficult to indoctrinate and
capable of relying on his own judge¬
ment for vital choices and decisions.
In these circumstances it is easy
to understand how deeply shocked
and astonished were those who, up
till then, had been responsible for the
educational process, when their power
and authority were questioned, not
timidly as in the past, by a few enligh¬
tened spirits, but on a massive scale
by the revolt and challenge of those
directly concerned.
E.
in recent years are
too well known to need enlarging upon.
Suffice it here to stress the importance
of a point in history at which the spirit
of contestation, which has been the
leaven of progress in all the essential
areas of modern civilization (the claims
of workers, women, coloured people,
colonies), penetrated the sector of
education until then bristling with
defensive devices.
Student action has achieved a huge
breach in the wall of educational
conservatism. Through this breach
has flooded an irresistible tide of long¬
standing questions, swelled by more
recent speculation and fed by im¬
patience and new hopes.
As has happened in face of oppres¬
sion, injustice and poverty, the victims
are no longer resigned to acquiesc¬
ence. Those who accept the defects
and shortcomings of education as
being part of the natural order of
things are becoming fewer and fewer.
The world appears to be in search
of a new form of education which,
like any new order, must establish a
balance between contradictory forces
and recognize its fragility and tempor¬
ary nature. It would be impossible
to draw up an exhaustive list of the
questions being put, whether of fund¬
amental importance or of detail. But
some of these questions are too insis¬
tent and too important to be ignored.
What should be the scope of the
educational process? To which parts
of the human personality does it
apply? Have not our definitions of it
up to now been too narrow and res¬
trictive? Have not physical, social,
emotional and aesthetic values been
sacrificed to a limited conception of
knowledge and the intellect?
When we consider the development
of the individual, what relationship is
there between objective factors (sex,
biological factors, socio-economic
status), the different forms of action
(on things and on men) and the various
educational methods?

Council for Cultural Co-operation of the Council of
Europe and the European Cultural Foundation.
EDUCATION PUT TO THE QUESTION
The price paid for
introduced into teaching methods and
programmes? Is not educational pract¬
ice in schools and universities itself a
formidable obstacle to the normal
development of creativity in the child
(and future adult)?
How can the function of education
be divided between in-school and
extra-curricular activities? Could not
educational institutions be used as
cultural centres for the community?
What training should teachers of all
kinds receive to prepare them for the
new tasks of education? In particular,
should not a teacher learn to listen
and to observe just as much as, if
not more than, to speak? Is not his
role to organize, to make the tools
of work and research available rather
than to spread out his wares of know¬
ledge before his pupils?
What is the place and the role of
competition in the field of teaching and
what limits should be imposed on it?
How can the principle of solidarity
and collaboration, so vital to the indi¬
vidual and to society, be safeguarded
against the effects of classification?
How can we make use of the mass
media, not only as a means of infor¬
mation and amusement, but for training
the mind and the critical faculties?
Can we allow national resources, of
necessity limited, to be wasted by
making children repeat a scholastic
year, by allowing them to drop out or
by weeding out processes against
which there is no appeal, etc.?
This is but a somewhat arbitrary
choice from a whole complex of ques¬
tions each of which involves allied
problems concerning the structures of
society, the place of education in
society and the manner in which
education fulfils the aspirations,
whether expressed or not, of indivi¬
duals and groups.
Everyone will find other questions
of his own, and I doubt if anyone is
capable of supplying an exhaustive
list of questions. The important thing
is to be aware of the central, dominant
fact education in its entirety has been
brought in question.
Of course, we could decide to make
no real changes and merely paper over
the cracks In the wall. The reasons
for inertia are easy to understand.
The introduction of a new order is a
formidable undertaking. It involves
renunciation and sacrifice and requires
an enormous amount of work of all
kinds calling for courage, resolution
and an unshakable confidence in
man's capabilities. It is the expres¬
sion of an optimistic view of life that

standing still
aims at sweeping away the remains
of the pessimistic view linked to out¬
worn beliefs. But there is a price to
be paid, sometimes a very high one,
even for standing still.
Different people have made, different
choices. The wind of change is rising
in many quarters. Here the teacher
has vacated his desk and no longer
stands out from his class. There the
very notion of the class has gone.
In some countries, instead of
schools, "educational units" are being
built which encompass the whole
educational process from the stand¬
point of the pupils (children, adoles¬
cents, adults), of the teaching given
(study, ante-professional training, leis¬
ure time organization, information and
communication), and of the teaching
profession (calling for a contribution
from all those members of the local
community who are in a position to
participate in the overall work of
teaching and training).
Above all there is the steady devel¬
opment of structures and methods in
adult education. Here we see applied
a number of the principles of the new
thinking about education: no compul¬
sion, no certificates (except in certain
exceptional cases) a choice. of activ¬
ities related to interests and. aptitudes;
exchange and dialogue; team work;
equality of status as between pupil
and teacher each of whom learns from
the other; drawing the utmost from
daily experience, etc.
s,lUCH advances, however
remarkable and essential they may be,
cannot all be applied to all educational
fields. There will always remain a
large area in the training of a child in
which he will be the recipient of instruc¬
tion, even though he will very early be
shown the way of autonomous learning
or self-instruction. The fact remains,
however, that adult education offers
patterns of a freedom of expression
from which all education can legitimat¬
ely and profitably draw inspiration.
We are on the threshold of a new
era in education in which more and
more stress will be laid on subject
matter. We shall move beyond the
old era in which man was, above all,
the object of the educational process.
We have seen that part of the
answer has developed in the world
of education itself. But this is, and
can only be, a partial solution. The
undertaking is too wide in scope to
remain the province of any one group,
no matter how qualified it may be.
The educational sector, it will readily
be understood, is not the best placed
to provide all the answers, both for
the reasons stated above and also
because it is neither satisfactory nor
helpful to be both judge and litigant.
One of the major contributions of
educators, aware of the shortcomings
of the theory and practice of the
educational process, has been the
recognition of the need for education
of a continuing nature. But the pres¬
ent success of the notion of continuing
education only serves to spotlight the
vastness of the research and exper¬
iment required before this concept
can become, not merely an inter¬
pretation of the educational process,
but a guide to action.
Who is to inform us as to the
conditions for and the rhythm of pers¬
onal development? This is the task of
the psychologist, the specialist in
characterology. Who will work out
the precise yield of the educational
process considered by itself and In
relation to other forms of investment?
This is a job for the economist.
For their part the sociologist and
the politician will shed light on the
role of education, as product and fac¬
tor, in the evolution of society. It is
the artist, surely, who will contribute
the most valuable lessons concerning
the relationship between the produc¬
tion of a work of art and the devel¬
opment of the human being.
For this new order, to which we
aspire, to take shape and root we
shall have to mobilize all available
intellectual, spiritual and practical res¬
ources as well as those forces that
support the whole social edifice.
Experience gained from working in
factory, field and office is surely just
as important to the elaboration of the
new educational doctrine as the wis¬
dom of philosophers, the imagination
of poets and the theoretical and pract¬
ical systems of learned men.
As a result of the new education
a new type of man will gradually
emerge who will be attuned to spiritual
progress and social advance. Such
a man will be less concerned with
arming himself with an arsenal of pat
answers and with assessing the
breadth of his learning by the number
of correct answers he can give. But
he will be the questioning man. By
a continuing educational effort he will
be able to handle with ease and a
sense of well-being the three essential
forms of questioning poetic, scientific
and political.

REALLY TOO MANY TEACHERS? (Continued from page 23)
for a quick end to the teaching pro¬
cess. Put a group of upper secondary
students preparing for university en¬
trance in a similar situation and the
result might be very different.
It is possible that this latter group
could be left alone with the machine,
and the need for teacher-student con¬
tact would thereby be reduced. Here
is the basic essence of the use of
new techniques in place of some, at
least, of the conventional teaching
force.
In the former case, however, the
human presence is still essential. At
the lower levels of education, per¬
haps during the time that students are
"compelled" to attend school, the
opportunities to reduce the number of
teachers would seem to be less than
those at the higher levels, where the
students are there voluntarily because
they are looking for something, can
understand the logic behind the need
for care of the precious machine and
generally can be trusted to act in a
responsible manner.
L
32
ooking at the cost aspects
of the new techniques, we find one
which stands out because of its cheap¬
ness. Many people associate program¬
med learning with a machine which
controls the presentation of the
sequential learning material. It is the
control which matters, not the machine,
and programmed material has been
presented in simple book form with
considerable success (1).
The student is simply expected to
cover up the answers to the material
in the successive boxes and to move
from box to box in accordance with
instructions instead of using an ex¬
pensive machine to do the same thing
for him. Essentially it is a matter of
his behaving in a responsible manner,
and if he can be made to see that it
is to his advantage to do so rather
than to "cheat", then the purpose is
achieved.
Preparation of such programmes
needs skill and care, and although
(I) As in the Unesco-United Nations De¬
velopment Programme project at the Institut
Pédagogique National de l'Enseignement
Technique (PNET) at Beirut, Lebanon.
programmed material presented in such
form may cost rather more than the
conventional text-book, it will cost
much less than complicated machines,
and it does mean in particular that the
learning of routine factual knowledge,
which many students now receive by
the conventional teacher-student con¬
tact, can be undertaken without the
presence of the teacher, if the students
can be trusted to follow the rules.
All this being said, there is one
important question to be answered.
To what extent is the personal in¬
fluence of the teacher on the taught
an essential part of the educational
process?
There are those who argue that no
mechanized form of instruction can
do the job better than a good teacher.
They maintain that the back-and-forth
interaction between teacher and taught
is essential for ensuring that the know¬
ledge which is being passed on is
correctly understood and for the
student to be able to use that know¬
ledge in an intelligent and constructive
manner. It is considered that a ma¬
chine cannot replace a good teacher
as the trainer of an imaginative, adapt¬
able human being; it might help him
to do so, but can never take his place.
There is also another aspect to the
question of the human influence, less
precise, less positively organized, but
in many philosophies of education as
important as the passing on of know¬
ledge and the ability to use it, if not
more so the moral training of the
student, the formation of his character.
Long ago, before our present cons¬
ciously organized style of education
existed, these personal influences were
automatically the responsibility of the
family and the community. To a great
extent they still are, but in some
countries they are now recognized as
partly the responsibility of the school.
In fact, when a child finds himself in
social contact with his fellow children
and adults in a school situation, such
influences happen of their own accord,
planned or otherwise, and, moreover,
they may not always be good in¬
fluences.
In which case, must it not be assum¬
ed that the school must inevitably
undertake part of this process? There
are cases where there is a distinct
necessity for a modern state to orga¬
nize corrective human influences on
children who come from disturbed
homes, and in fact the school is often
positively setting out to create an
atmosphere for that very purpose.
It can be argued that such compen¬
satory services should be provided
outside the school, but this is only
dodging the issue. In the full sense
of the word "education", this is an
educational activity and if social
workers are paid to undertake this task
the money and the manpower are in
fact devoted to an educational acti¬
vity, whatever the institutional orga¬
nization which is used for the purpose.
Is the human influence then
essential to the educational process,
whether for the purpose of passing on
knowledge and skills, for the purpose
of supervising, checking, guiding
students' work, or for the purpose of
exercising moral guidance on them ?
Again it must be said that this may
vary with students at different levels.
There must obviously be a difference
in attitude in this respect when one is
dealing with a primary school child as
against a student who is legally recog¬
nized as an adult and has a vote and
the legal right to own property and
marry without parental consent.
When it comes to the point, if a socie¬
ty decides that such human influences
are an essential part of the organized
educational process, then whatever
techniques, whatever machines, are
used in that process, a degree of
labour intensivity in education must
be considered as inevitable because
of the nature of the activity to be
performed.
Moreover, if this important service
is to be undertaken by suitable, train¬
ed professionals, society must be
prepared to pay them a remuneration
which they accept as compatible with
their status. With some twenty to
twenty-five per cent of the population
as students in schools and universities
the six to seven per cent limit to
the proportion of Gross National Pro¬
duct to be allocated to education would
then almost inevitably have to be
raised.

Letters to the Editor
WHO HAS 'OPTED OUT' 7
Sir,
In your interesting number, Youth
Today (April 1969), the article "Crisis
in Modern Society" begins: "Many
young people have dropped out . of
society..." As a secondary school tea¬
cher in daily contact with young people,
I disagree. Isn't it rather adults who
have "opted out" of their responsibili¬
ties and left young people to get on
with things as best they can? Isn't
youth's "yearning for emancipation" due
to their having to take on the respon¬
sibilities that their parents have evaded?
And hasn't the child or teen-ager with
a real home, and not just enough clo¬
thes, a place to live and a school to go
to, become the exception? The influence
of school, however great, can never
replace family life.
I know a 13-year old boy who spends
all his weekends alone at home because
his parents have a full programme of
outside social engagements, and also a
girl of 16 who had to live alone for
three months while her parents were
touring Europe. And there are two
boys, aged 13 and 15, in my class who
always bring the house key to school
because their parents are out more
often than not. Other young children
have to wait for hours in the caretaker's
flat at their apartment building, while
their mothers are at the cinema or
elsewhere. And there are plenty of
parents who can't even be bothered to
come to school when their children
receive prizes for their work.

'MOTHER OF RUSSIAN CITIES'
Sir,
As one interested in the problems of
preserving historic and cultural monu¬
ments, may I suggest that you publish
some articles on the architecture of
Kiev, often called "The Mother of Rus¬
sian Cities."
There are cities in the world whose
names are synonymous with great peri¬
ods in the history of art. Athens, for
instance, represents the art of Antiquity.
Constantinople (Istanbul) symbolizes
Byzantine art, to name but two. Kiev,
in which Kiev Rus art flourished during
the 12th and 13th centuries is another
such city. Its majestic buildings, among
them the Cathedral of St. Sophia, the
first in Russia to be decorated with su¬
perlative ensembles of mosaics and fres¬
coes, are world renowned. The history
of Kiev itself is no less interesting.

with it (and my husband has read it) it
goes to my father in England, then to
each of his neighbours. From there it
reaches my brother, after which it is
passed to his daughter who is a nurse
in London. After that I lose track of itl
But you can see that it is well circu¬
lated and deservedly so.

PUZZLING MASTERPIECE
Sir,
The "puzzling masterpiece" pictured
in Treasures of World Art (October
1969) might have been the stile of a
sun-dial. The animal is probably Capri-
cornis.
CM. Leiton
Dunoon, Scotland
Sir,
Although superficially resembling Wait
Disney's "Bambi," perhaps the creature
which inspired the creator of the "puzz¬
ling masterpiece" was in fact a member
of the class "Cephalopoda," a Decapod
a relative of the cuttlefish or squid.
The size is about right, and when looked
at upside down the resemblence is even
more striking.

PROBLEMS OF THE
WORKING WOMAN
Sir,
I enjoyed the July 1969 number of the
"Unesco Courier" very much. The
theme "Man and Employment" concerns
us all and I am pleased that you have
tackled this rather delicate question.
The article by Pierrette Sartin, "Real
and Pseudo Problems of the Working
Woman," did not come up to the stan¬
dard of the other contributions. The
article renders a doubtful service to
the question of women at work, just
because it is so polemic. She reproa¬
ches men for being afraid of the work¬
ing woman, and says that men oppose
professional careers for women only to
save their own skins. In short, she
lays the blame on man, who wants to
play the master of the world, while the
poor, innocent woman, on the contrary,
pines away under spiritual oppression.
In reality, the situation looks a little
different, and I am pleased that this
article was accompanied by a picture
of a brightly smiling woman sea-captain,
from which I can perhaps infer that you
yourselves are not quite in agreement
with the militant Pierrette Sartin.
For your amusement and for that of
your readers, I should like finally to add
a joke which throws some light on the
relative points of view of employers and
employees. The director of a factory
stands with his assistant at the window
at the end of working hours and says
to him: "Just look what work does to
peoplel In the morning they all come
to work sulky, and in the evening they
leave beaming and happy."
H. Haberli,
Berne, Switzerland
Editor's note: Our reader infers incor¬
rectly. We agree entirely with Ma¬
dame Perrette Sartin.
'DISCOVERY' OF AFRICA
Sir,
I found the article by Francine
N'Diaye, "The Art of African Pulleys"
(May 1969) particularly enjoyable. The
many illustrations, especially those in
colour, were most impressive. Africa
South of the Sahara, until now a closed
book in most respects, truly seems to
be revealing itself to the modern world
at last. A recent and striking example
was the First Pan-African Cultural Fes¬
tival which took place in Algiers in
July 1969. Practically all the African
nations took part and were able to
promote a better understanding of their
traditional and modern music, their
theatre, cinema and art.
Farid Younsi
Algiers, Algeria
YOUNG PEOPLE AND UNESCO
Sir,
I first started reading the "Unesco
Courier" ten years ago when I was a
student, and I am still grateful to the
teacher who introduced me to it. I am
now a lecturer in Social Education at
St. Michael's College of Education.
Malta, and my aim is to get as many
students as possible Interested in Unes¬
co and its work.
Philip Tortell
St Julian's, Malta
ERASMUS
Sir.
With reference to the interesting
article on Erasmus by Jean-Claude Mar¬
golin (November 1969), I would like to
correct two points. The photo caption
relating to the statue of Erasmus (page
5), states that it stands in the Great
Market Square of the new Rotterdam
which arose from the ruins of the
Second World War. The statue did, In
fact, stand In the Great Market Square
when the city was bombed in May 1940,
but it has since been removed to its
present site in Bulgersteyn Court, in
front of the house where Erasmus was
born (as your photo shows). The article
itself describes Erasmus' mother as the
daughter of a physician from Zeven-
becque. This should have read Zeven-
bergen.

OPERATION "RESCUE"
Sir,
In recent years, children in Spain's
primary and secondary schools have
been forming working groups with the
aim of rescuing forgottten or unknown
monuments and works of art. Under
Misión Rescata (Operation "Rescue") as
the movement is called, children work
under guidance from a teacher, and
operations are supervised from a centre
in Madrid. Apart from countless minor
works of art, the movement has already
unearthed a hitherto-unknown El Greco
and a Visigoth necropolis. I think this
example could inspire children in other
countries.

World illiteracy and
the population explosion
The rise in world population is out¬
stripping literacy drives. The number 'of
illiterates in the world has risen by about
60 million in the past decade and could
total over 800,000,000 this year. These
are some of the findings of a special
Unesco report on world illiteracy based
on information from 92 countries, which
is to appear shortly as a book. In some
countries, population is increasing so fast
that literacy campaigns can only slow
down the rate at which illiterates increase.
And between 1960 and 1980, it has been
calculated, the population of Asia will
increase by 60 per cent and that of Africa
by 65 per cent.
Trade union supports IEY
The United Automobile Workers, one of
the largest U.S. trade unions, has pledged
its support for International Education Year
through collaboration with Unesco. Pro¬
posals under consideration by the union's
International Affairs Department include: a
world conference Jointly sponsored with
Unesco on means of orienting education to
each person's life experience (one IEY goal
is promotion of the concept of lifelong
integrated education), and support for the
Unesco programme to use communications
satellites to beam educational programmes
directly to battery operated television sets
in developing countries.
British scientist awarded
1969 Kalinga Prize
The 1969 Kalinga Prize for the Popula¬
rization of Science, awarded annually by
an international jury chosen by Unesco,
goes to Sir Gavin de Beer of the United
Kingdom. Sir Gavin is well known as a
scientist for his research in zoology and
biology, and as a popularizer of scientific
subjects. His books have ranged over
scientific, historical, literary and philosoph¬
ic questions. From 1950 to 1960 he was
director of the British Museum of Natural
History, London.
To combat discrimination
in education
Unesco is to set up a Conciliation and
Good Offices Commission to deal with any
disputes that may arise between countries
adhering to the Unesco-sponsored Conven¬
tion Against Discrimination in Education.
The Convention, now ratified by 52 coun¬
tries, has been in force since 1962. It
seeks to promote equal educational oppor¬
tunities and treatment for all. The Conci¬
liation and Good Offices Commission is
the second of its kind to be set up within
U.N. system. for the promotion of human
rights. The first was created by ILO to
resolve conflicts over the freedom of trade
unions.
Taking the pulse
of the North Atlantic
The largest array of research buoys ever
to be moored in the ocean will be set out
in February 1970 by Soviet oceanographers.
Seventeen buoys equipped to measure
oceanic currents at depths of from 10 to
3,000 metres will be placed in the North
Atlantic near the Canary Islands for a
period of six months. Their observations
will help to solve problems concerning the
variability of North Atlantic currents, and
the influence these have on the weather.
When tested on a smaller scale in the
Arabian sea two years ago, the Soviet
system showed that even the chemical pro¬
perties of the ocean, including its corrosive
effects, vary from place to place.
'Unesco-Asia'
A new bilingual (English-French) quart¬
erly, "Unesco-Asia", has begun publication
in Tokyo (Japan). Published by the
Japanese National Commission for Unesco,
it reports on activities of Unesco National
Commissions in Asia and presents articles
of special interest to Asian readers.
Further details are available from: General
Affairs Division, Japanese National Com¬
mission for Unesco, 2-2, Kasunigaseki 3-
chrome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo.
Postgraduate courses
at French nuclear centre
An international postgraduate training
course organized by the French Commis¬
sariat of Atomic Energy in collaboration
with Unesco and the French National
Commission for Unesco will be held at the
National Institute of Science and Nuclear
Technology, Saclay, France, from October
1970 to July 1971. It will offer a choice
of four courses: Special Metallurgy, Higher
Electronics, Analytical Chemistry and Radio-
POSTAGE-STAMP ART
Two details of a third-century mosaic presented
to the U.N. by Tunisia in 1961 appear on 6 and
13 cent stamps issued recently by the U.N. Postal
Administration in its "Art at the United Nations"
series. The complete mosaic, showing the Four
Seasons and the Genius of the Year, has been
seen by millions of visitors to U.N. Headquarters in New York. As agent In France
for the U.N. Postal Administration, Unesco's Philatelic Service stocks all U.N.
stamps and first day covers currently on sale. For details write to the Unesco
Philatelic Service, Unesco, Place de Fontenoy, Paris 7e.
