Roots, Joe and Gorée,
1992, dry pastel, 59 x 79 cm,
by Camille Leblond
Camille Leblond is a French
painter who set up his studio
on the Senegalese island of
Gorée, which was one of the
earliest assembly points for
the Atlantic slave trade and
has been on Unesco's World
Heritage List since 1978.
Gorée's House of Slaves and
other monuments connected
with the slave trade attract
visitors from all over the
world, including black
Americans retracing the
steps their ancestors took
when they were shipped from
Africa two centuries ago. One
such black American is the
painter's friend Joe.

INTERVIEW
Lebanese pianist and composer
ABDEL RAHMAN EL BACHA
talks to Neda el Khazen
Abdel Rahman El Bacha won the prestigious Queen Elisabeth
of Belgium competition in 1978. Since then he has won an international reputation as one of the
most outstanding pianists of his generation, and has played with some of the world's leading
orchestras and conductors. Among his recordings are the early piano works of Prokofiev
(for which he was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque of the French Académie Charles Cros in
1983), three Bach concertos, a number of Mozart sonatas and Ravel's piano concertos.
He is currently recording all Beethoven's sonatas.
(All these records are published by Forlane, Boulogne, France).
Nowadays, all artists seek international
recognition. Is this is a sign ofa more universal
outbok, at least in the arts?
All artists need to be noticed because they
need to give something of themselves to every¬
body, without exception. I think this is the
main reason why they need worldwide recog¬
nition. They may never win unanimous praise
from the public during their own lifetime, but
the important thing for them is the feeling that
they have something to say. If other people are
slow to realize this then it's too bad above all
for them. Artists can always find consolation
in their art.
You grew up in Lebanon, a country per¬
meated by a wide variety of cultural
influences, in a family with a strong interest in
music. How didyour career as an artist begin?
It began in the most natural of ways, since I
lived and breathed music from when I was a
very small child. My father was a well-known
composer. My mother, who had an innate feel¬
ing for music, sang traditional and popular
songs without ever being able to read a single
note.
When I was about three or four, I hummed
the tunes written by my father, in which all the
vivid colouring of Lebanese folk music was
brought out by the harmonic richness of Wes¬
tern scoring and instrumentation. My father
had a piano on which he tried out his composi¬
tions. By the time I was about six, I could play
my favourite songs on it, a few tunes I had
picked up at random.
In 1967, when I was nine, I began to study
the piano seriously. As I came to discover clas¬
sical music, I developed a passion for Mozart,
Beethoven, Chopin and Schumann. At the age

of ten, I played a Bach concerto in public. I
gave my first recital in 1974 at the Assembly
Hall, the chapel of the American University of
Beirut. It was attended by the Soviet, British
and French ambassadors, who all offered me
scholarships. I opted for France, on account of
cultural affinities and also because I could go
on with my general education there. I was
accepted at the Conservatoire Supérieur de
Musique in Paris just before war broke out in
Lebanon.
M Ina country that has been wracked by long
years of war, do you think that other young
people will manage to make their careers in
music, just as you did?
I hope so. When people have to contend
with difficulties in their lives and with suffer¬
ing day in day out, music becomes a necessity,
a saving grace. Those young people will pro¬
bably enjoy fewer opportunities, but even so
there are still some piano teachers left in
Lebanon and it is still possible to find pianos,
even though there are not many skilled piano-
tuners and it can be very distressing to have to
work at the piano when you have lost a
member of your family or you are in the
middle of a bombardment. I do not think that
the war has stifled the urge to create on the
contrary. I give concerts in Lebanon regularly
and they are usually attended by large numbers
of young people who are clearly listening
intently to the music and are eager to under¬
stand and absorb it.
Music responds to a need for the absolute,
in that it cuts through the misunderstandings
that can be caused by words, in philosophical
and religious discourse, for example. Music
appeals to sensibility and intuition and speaks
straight to the heart. It is a universal language
which brings back humanity to its true calling
of spreading tolerance and love.
Sensibility and intuition are words that are
often used to describe the way you play with
great virtuosity, but without any of the flour¬
ishes or bravura passages that attract attention
to thepianist.
What I am looking for is true expressiveness.
I want to please, but only the most demanding
ear. I do not want to make a superficial impact.
You speak of virtuosity. I admit that I have a
certain fluency, but I could just as well have
put it to some other use. I want to use my
technical gifts to strive for the purest and most
rigorous form of expression. This is not to
everybody's taste and those who see art as a
diverting pastime do not necessarily appreciate
my style of playing.
And yet when you play one can always feel
yourpleasure in the music.
Consummate art to some degree entails
achieving harmony between mind and body. I
have always looked forward to sitting down at
the piano and playing. The moment I feel that I
am anywhere near saturation point, I stop, so
that my relationship with the piano and music
remains harmonious. I am happy whenever lis¬
teners experience this unity directly, through
the interpretations I offer them. Classical
music has a spiritual and aesthetic dimension
that brings me great happiness.
Do your musical tastes owe anything to the
culture in which you grew up?
Yes and no. My approach to music is never
purely intellectual, and this is doubtless due to
my origins. To reach me, music must be
melodic before all else. I grew up in Lebanon,
between East and West, and this has certainly
played a part in shaping my tastes. All the
same, I have never made a distinction between
Oriental and Western music, but rather be¬
tween music I found beautiful and music I
didn't.
Isn't beauty a relative notion, subject to
change?
Certainly. Because with time, people mature
and absorb life's vibrations differently. Things
we find beautiful at the age of fifteen may
appear different to us when we get to thirty. I
am thinking particularly of one Chopin
concerto, which I considered sublime when I
was quite young. Today, I see the charm of this
piece as being something quite different from
what I saw then. The way I look at it has
changed and so have my feelings towards it.
When I was fifteen, I wasn't very keen on
playing Beethoven's late sonatas. I was quite
incapable of grasping or even guessing at the
suffering that haunts them. Today, I feel that
if anything ought to survive forever, it is
Beethoven's last works.
What attracts you to Beethoven?
Both the man and the artist. Beethoven is an
artist whose humanist thinking is fed by his
art. His music is truly the reflection of his per¬
sonality, the product of an outstanding mind
and a profoundly generous human being. The
intellectual stature is on a par with the feeling. I
respond to the man as much as I do to the
work, and this makes me want to play and
interpret his music.
Nothing is more difficult to achieve in art
than the marvellous balance he managed to
strike between technique and sensibility, be¬
tween form and emotion. In The Prophet, the
great Lebanese writer Khalil Gibran compared
passion to a rudderless ship and reason to a
ship with a rudder but with no sails. Instinct
must be the ally of knowledge and we must
beware of being carried away by fashions
based on the worship of spontaneity, since they
will always lack an essential dimension. In this
respect, nature sets us a fine example of har¬
mony. Look at a tree and see how beautiful it
is and yet what complexity there is beneath
its' aesthetic perfection!
In recording the whole of Beethoven's
sonatas, you have embarked on a very ambi¬
tious undertaking. What prompted you to do
this?
I have already cut seven of the nine records
that are due to be issued between now and
1994. In all, it will have taken me six years, a
year and a half more than expected. What
prompted me? One day, I felt an urge to play
all these sonatas in their chronological order.
As I did so, I realized that they formed a pro¬
gression, in the course of which the tone and
the style matured. They are a reflection of the
composer's life and psychological develop¬
ment. So I wanted to play the early sonatas in
the way suggested by this pattern of develop¬
ment, gradually moving away from the
influence of his predecessors, such as Haydn,
and trimming away features that Beethoven
himself eventually discarded, so as to reveal
their essential nature. This is an enthralling
task, but a difficult one. When I come to the
end, in early 1994, 1 shall play all thirty-two
sonatas at seven recitals extending over a
period of two and a half months at the Châtelet
auditorium in Paris.
What are yourplans after that?
At the moment, I am irresistibly drawn to
three composers. Chopin, my first great passion
at the keyboard, whom I am now rediscov¬
ering by re-reading his works and his life
especially the accounts his students left of the
way he played and taught the piano. He
emerges as a rather different person from the
Chopin we usually hear. One can see that he
]]>

deliberately set out to be simple and uncompli¬
cated, shunning facile effects and seeking
purity of expression through the depth he gave
to certain details. Chopin's music was long
played unsystematically, whereas his own
playing was more disciplined.
Then there is Schumann, whose music
overwhelms me, even though certain chords
more descriptive than expressive, and too
jerky repel me a little. Even so, his music is
sincere; it comes from the soul of a poet. It is a
token of freedom, compared with the conven¬
tions of his time.
Thirdly, there is Ravel, the only French
composer of whom I am an unconditional
admirer and whose works for piano which fit
onto only three discs, incidentally I should
really like to record. What attracts me to him is
his style, his feeling for Oriental colour
through his taste for Spanish music, and his
modesty. He drew a prodigious sound quality
from the piano.
Do you consistently look for Oriental tones
in classical music?
I am captivated by music that conjures up
memories of my childhood, quite apart from
the satisfaction it gives me as a musician and
pianist. But "local" effects, whether Oriental
or Western, are not the first thing I look for.
Beethoven would not have interested me if,
instead of expressing the human soul, he had
only reflected German culture, much as I
admire that culture. But what makes music so
precious to me is that it transcends civiliza¬
tions. It is true that we are all products of a
particular civilization, which shapes our person¬
ality in ways that we don't always realize. On
the other hand, we may have a conscious wish
to reach out to all humanity and to refine the
way we express ourselves in order to embrace
the universal. If music which has an Oriental
tone strives towards that absolute, then I'm all
for it. But if Oriental colouring is the only
thing it has to offer, then it's not what I am
looking for.
Presumably the outstanding polyphonic
qualities of the piano make it the best instru¬
ment forproducing a wide variety ofsounds.
The piano is the instrument that englobes all
the others: the human voice, woodwind and
strings, the sounds of nature. It is like an
orchestra, in the sense that it can be made to
produce bass registers, harmonies and instru¬
mental tones. But the fact remains that the
piano is a percussion instrument and it is quite
a feat to make it sing. No instrument is perfect:
it is easy to play a tied legato on a violin, but it
is sometimes difficult to grasp the rhythm.
You are invited to perform all over Europe,
in Japan, the Middle East and the United
States. European classical music gets an extra¬
ordinary reception all over the world. Does
Europe offer a similar welcome to music from
otherparts of the world?
The grandeur of classical music speaks to
our innermost selves, no matter what civiliza¬
tion we belong to. For me, there have never
been any barriers separating different musical
forms and traditions. I find the same spiritua¬
lity, the same power of expression, the same
nobility of language in great Arab music as I
do in Indian instrumental improvisations,
although they may be difficult to grasp if we
have not been taught to appreciate or under¬
stand them. We need Indian music today just
as much as we need Beethoven's symphonies.
What we must do is learn to approach these dif¬
ferent musical languages and look further than
the aspects of them which bind them to a
particular culture or period and all too often
confine them to a local setting. Thanks to record¬
ings, these musical forms are now reaching new
audiences, but much remains to be done if they
are to occupy the place they deserve.
M Do you teach?
I taught in an academy of music for two
years. At the moment, I give private lessons to
advanced students. Some of my students study
pieces which I myself have played but which
they interpret differently. This kind of com¬
parison is very instructive, in that it forces me
to examine and justify my own approach to the
works in question. I have to do this if I am to
provide my students with sustenance.
But the important thing is that students
should propose something coherent, and if
they do I encourage them to persevere in their
way of thinking. Teaching obliges people to
acknowledge the existence of diversity and, in
that sense, it leads to a truly human learning
process and compels one to look afresh at one¬
self and one's art.
What are your feelings when you give a
concert and experience those marvellous but
fleeting moments that can never be exactly
repeated?
I experience through the music a moment of
intense communion with my fellow human
beings. If my programmes were designed
merely to charm and captivate the audience,
the bond would probably not be the same. The
bond is intense because the message conveyed
by the music is also intense.
The way you face the audience changes
considerably as you get older. When you are
very young, you don't get stage-fright, but by
the time you are ten or eleven, you start to feel
it, although it is still easy to motivate your¬
self you want to pass examinations and win
diplomas, and this makes you combative. You
only really start to realize the risks you are
taking after the age of twenty. It is very fright¬
ening, an awesome responsibility, to give a
concert before the public in a hall where great
musicians have performed before you. I had to
take a firm grip on myself before I realized that
stage-fright is really a kind of pride. I saw that
I had to fight that feeling by telling myself that
what people came to hear was not me but the
music and that I wanted to offer them that
music in the way that I liked it and that they
too might like it. This completely changed my
attitude to performing in public. I no longer
felt that a concert was an occasion for me to
perform acrobatics although I can do that
but a moment of pure beauty to be shared. The
conquest of pride is a task that must be faced
every day of our lives. The lessons of humility
are endless.

The challenge ofdemocracy
MONTEVIDEO in 1990, Prague in 1991, and Tunis in 1992three
capitals on three different continents have served as the
venues for meetings marking three successive stages in the
debate on democracy in the present-day world on which UNESCO has
embarked. This geographical diversity is not fortuitous, since democracy
is no longer the historical privilege of any one continent. To quote the
celebrated phrase which Jean-Paul Sartre used long ago to describe
Marxism, democracy has become the ""boundless horizon" of our time.
Hopes for renewal are increasingly being vested in democracy, not only in
Latin America and Eastern Europe, but also and this is not stressed often
enough outside the orbit of European culture, in Africa and Asia. With
waning nationalistic fervour and the fading of socialist mirages, individuals
in the South are aspiring to a form of citizenship that protects them both
from the pressures of the community and from state oppression.
In societies where individuals are required to perform many duties,
they are now intent on enjoying rights, discharging responsibilities and
availing themselves of the freedom to think, to speak, and to choose and
dismiss their leaders.
But as the ideal of freedom spreads to the entire planet, it is meeting
hitherto unknown obstacles and raising new questions. It arouses differ¬
ent expectations in different places. Some define it in essentially negative
terms as the end of dictatorship. For others, it satisfies a hunger for indi¬
vidual emancipation and is synonymous with a democratic system
whose contours have yet to be traced in today's fast-changing political,
economic and cultural landscape. For yet others, it is coming to mean
the establishment of a specific set of legal and political institutions.
Democracy can only exist in places where people are free to choose
those who rule them. It is also vital that its ground-rules should be res¬
pected by all concerned and that no-one should be able to use universal
suffrage to gain power and then deprive others of access to power. In
other words, democracy must be rooted in a set of values, rules and prio¬
rities which are broadly shared and allow acceptable compromises to be
made between divergent interests.
In a context in which crucial economic and technological choices are
being made at the world level and no longer by nations and regions
acting individually the fate of democracy in any country is bound to be
influenced by international developments. The economic balances and
social solidarity that are the prerequisites for building democracy in indi¬
vidual countries are becoming increasingly imperative on a global scale.
In other words, the fate of freedom can now be said to depend, to some
degree, on each and every one of us.

WHAT IS DEMOCRACY?
byAlain Touraine
8
DEMOCRACY these days is more com¬
monly defined in negative terms, as
freedom from arbitrary actions, the per¬
sonality cult or the rule of a nomenklatura, than
by reference to what it can achieve or the social
forces behind it. What are we celebrating today?
The downfall of authoritarian regimes or the
triumph of democracy? And we think back and
remember that popular movements which over¬
threw anciens régimes have given rise to totalita¬
rian regimes practising state terrorism.
So we are initially attracted to a modest,
purely liberal concept of democracy, defined
negatively as a regime in which power cannot
be taken or held against the will of the major¬
ity. Is it not enough of an achievement to rid
the planet of all regimes not based on the free
choice of government by the governed? Is this
cautious concept not also the most valid, since
it runs counter both to absolute power based
on tradition and divine right, and also to the
voluntarism that appeals to the people's inter¬
ests and rights and then, in the name of its libe¬
ration and independence, imposes on it military
or ideological mobilization leading to the
repression of all forms of opposition?
This negative concept of democracy and
freedom, expounded notably by Isaiah Berlin
and Karl Popper, is convincing because the
main thing today is to free individuals and
groups from the stifling control of a governing
élite speaking on behalf of the people and the
nation. It is now impossible to defend an anti-
liberal concept of democracy, and there is no
longer any doubt that the so-called "people's
democracies" were dictatorships imposed on
peoples by political leaders relying on foreign
armies. Democracy is a matter of the free
choice of government, not the pursuit of
"popular" policies.
In the light of these truths, which recent
events have made self-evident, the following
question must be asked. Freedom of political
choice is a prerequisite of democracy, but is it
the only one? Is democracy merely a matter of
procedure? In other words, can it be defined
without reference to its ends, that is to the rela¬
tionships it creates between individuals and
groups? At a time when so many authoritarian
regimes are collapsing, we also need to examine
the content of democracy although the most
urgent task is to bear in mind that democracy
cannot exist without freedom of political choice.
The collapse of the revolutionary
illusion
Revolutions sweep away an old order: they do
not create democracy. We have now emerged
from the era of revolutions, because the world
is no longer dominated by tradition and reli¬
gion, and because order has been largely
replaced by movement. We suffer more from
the evils of modernity than from those of tradi¬
tion. Liberation from the past interests us less
and less; we are more and more concerned
about the growing totalitarian power of the
new modernizers. The worst disasters and the
greatest injury to human rights now stem not
from conservative despotism but from modern¬
izing totalitarianism.
We used to think that social and national
revolutions were necessary prerequisites for the
birth of new democracies, which would be
social and cultural as well as political. This idea
has become unacceptable. The end of our cen¬
tury is dominated by the collapse of the revolu¬
tionary illusion, both in the late capitalist coun¬
tries and in the former colonies.
But if revolutions move in a direction dia¬
metrically opposed to that of democracy, this
does not mean that democracy and liberalism
necessarily go together. Democracy is as far
removed from liberalism as it is from revolu¬
tion, for both liberal and revolutionary regimes,
despite their differences, have one principle in

common: they both justify political action
because it is consistent with natural logic.
Revolutionaries want to free social and
national energies from the shackles of the capi¬
talist profit motive and of colonial rule. Lib¬
erals call for the rational pursuit of interests and
satisfaction of needs. The parallel goes even fur¬
ther. Revolutionary regimes subject the people
to "scientific" decisions by avant-garde intel¬
lectuals, while liberal regimes subject it to the
power of entrepreneurs and of the "enlight¬
ened" classes the only ones capable of
rational behaviour, as the French statesman
Guizot thought in the nineteenth century.
But there is a crucial difference between
these two types of regime. The revolutionary
approach leads to the establishment of an all-
powerful central authority controlling all
aspects of social life. The liberal approach, on
the other hand, hastens the functional differen¬
tiation of the various areas of life politics, reli¬
gion, economics, private life and art. This
reduces rigidity and allows social and political
conflict to develop which soon restricts the
power of the economic giants.
But the weakness of the liberal approach is
that by yoking together economic moderniza¬
tion and political liberalism it restricts democracy

to the richest, most advanced and best-educated
nations. In other words, elitism in the interna¬
tional sphere parallels social elitism in the
national sphere. This tends to give a governing
elite of middle-class adult men in Europe and
America enormous power over the rest of the
world over women, children and workers at
home, as well as over colonies or dependent
territories.
One effect of the expanding power of the
world's economic centres is to propagate the
spirit of free enterprise, commercial consump¬
tion and political freedom. Another is a grow¬
ing split within the world's population be¬
tween the central and the peripheral
sectors the latter being not that of the subject
peoples but of outcasts and marginals. Capital,
resources, people and ideas migrate from the
periphery and find better employment in the
central sector.
The liberal system does not automatically,
or naturally, become democratic as a result of
redistribution of wealth and a constantly rising
standard of general social participation. Instead
it works like a steam engine, by virtue of a big
difference in potential between a hot pole and a
cold pole. While the idea of class war, often dis¬
regarded nowadays, no longer applies to post-
revolutionary societies, it still holds good as a
description of aspects of liberal society that are
so basic that the latter cannot be equated with
democracy.
The twilight
of social democracy
This analysis is in apparent contradiction with
the fact that social democracy developed in the
most capitalist countries, where there was a
considerable redistribution of income as a
result of intervention by the state, which
appropriated almost half the national income
and in some cases, especially in the Scandina¬
vian countries, even more.
The main strength of the social democratic
idea stems from the link it has forged between
democracy and social conflict, which makes the
working-class movement the main driving-
force in building a democracy, both social and
political. This shows that there can be no
democracy unless the greatest number sub¬
scribes to the central principles of a society and
culture but also no democracy without fun¬
damental social conflicts.
What distinguishes the democratic position
from both the revolutionary and the liberal
position is that it combines these two prin¬
ciples. But the social democratic variant of
these principles is now growing weaker, partly
because the central societies are emerging from
industrial society and entering post-industrial
society or a society without a dominant model,
and partly because we are now witnessing the
triumph of the international market and the
weakening of state intervention, even in
Europe.
So Swedish social democracy, and most par¬
ties modelled on social democracy, arc
anxiously wondering what can survive of the
policies constructed in the middle of the cen¬
tury. In some countries the trade union move¬
ment has lost much of its strength and many of
its members. This is particularly true in France,
the United States and Spain, but also in the
United Kingdom to say nothing of the ex-
communist countries, where trade unions long
ago ceased to be an independent social force. In
nearly all countries trade unionism is moving
out of the industrial workplace and turning
into neocorporatism, a mechanism for protect¬
ing particular professional interests within the
machinery of the state: and this leads to a back-

lash in the form of wild-cat strikes and the
spread of parallel ad hoc organizations.
So we come to the most topical question
about democracy: if it presupposes both parti¬
cipation and conflict, but if its social-demo¬
cratic version is played out, what place does it
occupy today? What is the specific nature of
democratic action, and what is the "positive"
content of democracy? In answering these
questions we must first reject any single prin¬
ciple: we must equate human freedom neither
with the universalism of pragmatic reason (and
hence of interest) nor with the culture of a
community. Democracy can neither be solely
liberal nor completely popular.
Unlike revolutionary historicism and liberal
utilitarianism, democratic thinking today starts
from the overt and insurmountable conflict
between the two faces of modern society. On
the one hand is the liberal face of a continually
changing society, whose efficiency is based on

the maximization of trade, and on the circula¬
tion of money, power, and information. On the
other is the opposing image, that of a human
being who resists market forces by appealing to
subjectivity the latter meaning both a desire
for individual freedom and also a response to
tradition, to a collective memory. A society free
to arbitrate between these two conflicting
demands that of the free market and that of
individual and collective humanity, that of
money and that of identity may be termed
democratic.
The main difference as compared with the
previous stage, that of social democracy and the
industrial society, is that the terms used are
much further apart than before. We are now
concerned not with employers and wage-ear¬
ners, associated in a working relationship, but
with subjectivity and the circulation of sym¬
bolic goods.
These terms may seem abstract, but they are
no more so than employers and wage-earners.
They denote everyday experiences for most
people in the central societies, who are aware
that they live in a consumer society at the same
time as in a subjective world. But it is true that
these conflicting facets of people's lives have not
so far found organized political expression
just as it took almost a century for the political
categories inherited from the French Revolution
to be superseded by the class categories specific
to industrial society. It is this political time-lag
that so often compels us to make do with a
negative definition of democracy.
Arbitration
Democracy is neither purely participatory nor
purely liberal. It above all entails arbitrating,
and this implies recognition of a central conflict
between tendencies as dissimilar as investment
and participation, or communication and sub¬
jectivity. This concept can be adapted to the
most affluent post-industrializing countries and
to those which dominate the world system; but
does it also apply to the rest of the world, to
the great majority of the planet?
A negative reply would almost completely
invalidate the foregoing argument. But in Third
World countries today arbitration must first
and foremost find a way between exposure to
world markets (essential because it determines
competitiveness) and the protection of a per¬
sonal and collective identity from being deval¬
ued or becoming an arbitrary ideological
construct.
Let us take the example of the Latin Amer¬
ican countries, most of which fall into the
category of intermediate countries. They are
fighting hard and often successfully to regain
and then increase the share of world trade they 11

once possessed. They participate in mass cul¬
ture through consumer goods, television pro¬
grammes, production techniques and educa¬
tional programmes. But at the same time they
are reacting against a crippling absorption into
the world economic, political and cultural
system which is making them increasingly
dependent. They are trying to be both univer¬
salist and particularist, both modern and faith¬
ful to their history and culture.
Unless politics manages to organize arbitra¬
tion between modernity and identity, it cannot
fulfil the first prerequisite of democracy,
namely to be representative. The result is a dan¬
gerous rift between grass-roots movements seek¬
ing to defend the individuality of communities,
and political parties, which are no more than
coalitions formed to achieve power by support¬
ing a candidate.
The main difference between the central
countries and the peripheral ones is that in the
former a person is defined primarily in terms
of personal freedom, but also as a consumer,
whereas in the latter the defence of collective
identity may still be more important, to the
extent that there is pressure from abroad to
impose some kind of bloodless revolution in
the form of compulsory modernization on the
pattern of other countries.
This conception of democracy as a process
of arbitration between conflicting components
of social life involves something more than the
idea of majority government. It implies above
all recognition of one component by another,
and of each component by all the others, and
hence an awareness both of the similarities and
the differences between them. It is this that
most sharply distinguishes the "arbitral"
concept from the popular or revolutionary view
of democracy, which so often carries with it the
idea of eliminating minorities or categories
opposed to what is seen as progress.
In many parts of the world today there is
open warfare between a kind of economic
modernization which disrupts the fabric of
society, and attachment to beliefs. Democracy
cannot exist so long as modernization and
identity are regarded as contradictory in this
way. Democracy rests not only on a balance or
compromise between different forces, but also
on their partial integration. Those for whom
progress means making a clean sweep of the
past and of tradition are just as much the ene¬
mies of democracy as those who see moderni¬
zation as the work of the devil. A society can
only be democratic if it recognizes both its
unity and its internal conflicts.
Hence the crucial importance, in a demo¬
cratic society, of the law and the idea of justice,
defined as the greatest possible degree of com¬
patibility between the interests involved. The
prime criterion of justice is the greatest possible
freedom for the greatest possible number of
actors. The aim of a democratic society is to
produce and to. respect the greatest possible
amount of diversity, with the participation of
the greatest possible number in the institutions
and products of the community. Q

ON a trip to Prague in early January 1990,
a few days after the fall of Ceausescu, I
saw a poster in front of the Romanian
Embassy that read: "Ceausescu, there is no
room in Europe for you!"
I was both amused and shocked. Did it mean
that there is room for dictators and despots in
other continents? It was, admittedly, only a
naive slogan invented by some demonstrator or
other. But whether or not it is formulated in so
many words, the idea exists, and I would be
inclined to say that most people believe it. Des¬
potism and disrespect for human rights are
somehow less shocking when they occur in
Asia, Africa or in the countries of the South
generally. There is a horizontal dividing line
beyond which values are different, as if some
other variety of the human race were concerned.
The end of the period of East-West confronta¬
tion has only magnified this apparent division.
In the thrill of reunion and justifiably proud
at seeing the triumph of certain values, Europe
runs the risk of forgetting the rest of the world,
which is now regarded in some quarters as
being politically unimportant and economically
beyond redemption. It is a strong possibility
that in the next fifteen years Europe will be so
preoccupied with the reconstruction of its cen¬
tral and southern regions that it will have no
time for the rest of the world, with which its
relations will be antagonistic.
Putting the "common European home" in
order must obviously come first. However,
since the European model is currently the only
credible universal model we have, it cannot be
confined to one continent. Europeanism is a
great idea, but humanism is a much greater one.
As for Eurocentrism, it is a short-sighted view
of things which is liable sooner or later to dash
today's hopes.
Does this mean that Europe must impose its
model on everyone else? Perhaps not, but it is
Europe's duty to accept certain conditions in its
relations with the rest of the world. The first of
these conditions is that the countries of the
South, which depend on the North for their
economic survival and arms supplies, should be
forced to desist from any form of despotism,
infringement of liberty, and excessive militariza¬
tion. Conditions now exist which can make it
impossible for any despotic regime to survive
and which can establish new standards of behav¬
iour throughout the world. Only a short time
ago the rivalry between the two big military and
ideological blocs meant that the attainment of
such standards was a Utopian dream. Today
despotism, torture, oppression, racism and war¬
mongering can be outlawed. There is no longer
any justification for supporting dictators on the
grounds that they provide a bulwark against
communism, or on any other such pretext.
It is true that some politicians and busi¬
nessmen may be tempted to turn a blind eye to
the behaviour of rulers who look kindly on
their interests. But the role of public opinion
that is to say of the media, intellectuals and
citizen groups is to ensure that these stan¬
dards are unfailingly observed.
In various parts of the world, only demo¬
cracy can put an end to military adventurism
and pave the way for the settlement of
conflicts. Moreover, economic development
cannot be seriously contemplated without the
rule of law. The idea that despotism is a prelude
to development has seldom been supported by
events; it has far more often delayed or trun¬
cated the process by stifling a society's vitality.
We are always being told that a new era has
begun. We were told this after the First World
War, and again after the Second. On each occa¬
sion, reorganization of the world by the victors
turned out to be a disastrous prelude to fresh
conflicts. Will our own post-war era be any dif¬
ferent? Can we prevent the failure of misguided
internationalist ideas from leading to acceptance
of the excesses of nationalism? Or prevent the
collapse of misguided egalitarianism from justi¬
fying the excesses of runaway liberalism?
Will our generation write an epilogue
worthy of this sublime and terrifying century?
And a preamble to the centuries ahead? Q 13

AFRICA PROMISE
AND UNCERTAINTY
byElikiaM'Bokolo
14
DURING the pre-colonial period, those
political units in Africa that had no
developed state structures were grad¬
ually absorbed, in an increasingly brutal way,
into larger groupings that had. African societies
thereby learned that any authority tends to
arrogate to itself as much power as it can, and
that every state, if left uncontrolled, tends to
abuse its power.
Secession was one of the oldest forms of
protest. Dissident individuals or groups would
switch their allegiance to rulers renowned for
their tolerance, or more often would set up new
units that responded better to the people's aspi¬
rations to liberty and autonomy.
Forms of political control varied between
cultures, but one characteristic common to
most traditional societies was the sanctity of
kingship. A connection was made between on
the one hand the welfare of the world and the
community and on the other the physical and
moral state of the king, who was held account¬
able for every economic, political or ecological
crisis. Royal failings, such as erratic and anti¬
social behaviour, were punishable. The holder
of supreme power would pay the supreme
penalty. These practices seem to have func¬
tioned in many parts of the continent and tem¬
pered many abuses.
In the nineteenth century a more complex
form of state organization came into being.
Most states opted for a federal rather than a
centralized system, at least until belated
attempts were made to enforce unification on
the eve of colonization. Once they had pro¬
claimed their allegiance to the king and had
accepted such obligations as paying taxes and
providing soldiers for the army, the local
units villages, ancient kingdoms or tribes
kept their own laws, customs, language and
religious practices.
There are indications that this political
model still lingers in people's memories. It is
remarkable that one factor in current demands
for democracy has been the desire to set up or
restore federal structures in many states. This
may reflect a departure from the centralization
inherited from the colonial era (in the French-
and Portuguese-speaking countries) or its
immediate aftermath (primarily in the English-
speaking ones), but perhaps it also suggests a
determination to return to older traditions.
With the coming of colonialism, collective
resistance began to express itself in new fields
against foreign domination and harsh exploita¬
tion. For too long a heroic, elitist vision credited
this resistance to modern political parties, intel¬
lectual leaders and administrators produced
under colonization, and to the future "fathers of
the nation". In fact the most enduring resistance
came, throughout the colonial period, from
"stateless societies" that opposed the forces of
occupation and the new forms of subjection
imposed by the Europeans in much the same
way as they had resisted pressure from the great
nineteenth-century African state structures.
The most perceptive colonialists were aware
that societies of this type were unfailingly hos¬
tile to all forms of oppression. Governor
Gabriel Angoulvant, who was responsible for
the "pacification" of the Ivory Coast, noted
that "One of the greatest difficulties we have
encountered in establishing our influence lies in
the attitude of the natives or, to put it bluntly,
in the moral condition of the country. . . . The
previous state of anarchy, which had real
advantages for savage populations, is still too
persistent among the natives of the centre of

the colony and the lower Ivory Coast. It has
left profound traces everywhere, and its gradual
disappearance is causing too many regrets for
all its effects to disappear."
By the late nineteenth century, the political
struggle of educated Africans and the urban
working classes was beginning to make an
impact in Senegal, South Africa, Ghana and
Nigeria. At first the colonial authorities
contained the agitation within the bounds of
a mild reformism, and opposition only really
took off after the Second World War, when the
rural population began to rally to the new poli¬
tical parties. It was then that the colonizers
reluctantly agreed to reform the colonial
system before being forced to wind it up
altogether.
Many forms of resistance helped to shatter
the colonial edifice: opposition from the syn¬
cretic churches and Messianic movements; 15

workers' strikes and mutinies among the
police; insurrections in rural areas and armed
rebellions, almost always led by self-pro¬
claimed religious revivalists; communist ideolo¬
gies and methods imported from Europe
(notably into South Africa, French West Africa
and the Portuguese colonies); and non-violent
resistance, which was particularly widespread
in Ghana.
The diversity of these home-grown and
imported forms of opposition illustrates the
extent of resistance within African societies, as
well as their capacity for invention. They
contained the demands for democracy that
were a feature of this phase of history and are
in many cases re-emerging today. Overt and
covert forms of racism were rejected. So too
were all kinds of discrimination based on ethnic
or religious criteria or on a so-called respect for
cultural sensibilities which was nothing more
than racism in a subtle and shameful disguise.
Demands for sovereignty were made. There
was a desire to replace unapproachable bureau¬
cracies in distant capitals with effective partici¬
pation in public affairs. In material terms Afri¬
cans aspired to enjoy a minimum of available
wealth. Culturally they sought the richest pos¬
sible experience of modern artistic creation and
knowledge.
The most sincere and clear-sighted leaders
of the independence movements, men such as
Patrice Lumumba and, later, Amilcar Cabrai,
expressed all these aspirations. More often,
however, the politicians who rose to head (or
were placed at the head of) these movements
emphasized the legal and political side of the
struggle. Kwame Nkrumah, one of the most
fervently nationalistic of them all, told his fol¬
lowers "Seek ye first the political kingdom, and
all other things shall be added onto it".
In practice, the citizens of the new nations
rarely found the political kingdom, still less
what was to be added onto it. One-party sys¬
tems proliferated in the post-independence
period. In many lands, the old colonial set-up
was re-established under a new name and on
different pretexts. Everywhere the people grew
poorer at a time when most of the leaders were
feathering their nests.
The notion of "second independence"
sometimes used to describe the demands and
struggles of today neatly expresses the conti¬
nuity between past and present discontent.
Continuity does not, however, imply that slo¬
gans, aspirations or political programmes are
necessarily the same. On the contrary, it seems
that unsatisfied earlier aspirations have been
absorbed into fresh ones. This suggests that the
present situation is serious and that irreversible
processes are now under way in a group of

states which are all, as it were, several revolu¬
tions behind and pregnant with major reforms
that have yet to be born.
A LONG HISTORY
OF INTERNAL DISSENT
The actors who now dominate the African
political scene and are imposing a long overdue
process of democratization are merely going
through a crucial stage in what J. Copans has
called a "long march", the first steps of which
can be traced back to the disillusionment that
followed independence. Since the 1960s, pea¬
sants, young people, intellectuals, women, the
urban working classes, and professional politi¬
cians have all, with varying degrees of intensity
at different times and in different countries,
tried to change the course of events.
Specialists in African history and political
sociology have tended to pay little heed to
these counter-movements and voices of dissent.
It is only in the last decade that they have
begun to pay attention to grassroots politics
and popular dissidence, and by that time the
bandwagon was already moving at speed.

In the early 1960s, the Congo (today Zaïre)
was engulfed in peasant rebellions against a
state that was identified with bureaucratic cen¬
tralization, technocratic and authoritarian
modernization, neo-colonialism, fiscal extor¬
tion and corruption. Disturbances in the towns
and cities, whether organized by workers (as in
the case of the resignation of Abbé Fulbert
Youlou in Congo in 1963) or by school stu¬
dents like those which led to the downfall of
Jean Bedel Bokassa in the Central African
Empire in 1979, brought down a number of
regimes that exemplified the worst features of
the post-colonial period.
Even supposedly stable regimes, which
were for that reason attractive to Western
investors, had to cope with endemic protest in
forms ranging from student and teacher discon¬
tent, to remonstrations from Christian and
syncretic churches and from Muslim brother¬
hoods, and repeated criticisms from intellec¬
tuals and artists, who have had a greater impact
than is often thought.
A number of artists have done much to
instil in young people the spirit of radical criti¬
cism that is widespread today. The songs of the
Nigerian musician Fela, with their vitriolic des¬
criptions of the acquisitive lifestyle of the Niger¬
ian middle class, are one example. Another is
the Congolese singer Zao, whose less overtly
political works nonetheless praise such for¬
bidden notions as antimilitarism and pacifism,
describe the difficulties of city life, and deduce
from the equality of all people in the face of
death the same equality for the living.
The movement towards democracy accel¬
erated rapidly in the 1980s, for reasons that have
yet to be fully analysed. Many commentators
have pointed to the wind blowing at gale force
from Eastern Europe or to factors such as the
"Gorbachev effect" or the "Ceausescu effect".
But why not look at events in Africa itself?.
On the positive side, for instance, there was a
"Senghor effect", proving that a one-party
regime could move without mishap towards
multi-party democracy. There was also a "Man¬
dela effect". On the other side of the coin were
the "Bokassa effect", which showed how a
regime actively supported by a great power
could be brought down by a movement trig¬
gered by students, and the "Idi Amin effect",
the toppling of an archetypal bloodthirsty dic¬
tatorship by a long civil war.
The autocratic oligarchies are on the defen¬
sive. But though they may be shaky, they are
still on their feet. And so the extraordinary
diversity of current forms of struggle illustrates
two things: the inventiveness of the champions
of democracy, and also the resilience and adap¬
tability of the existing regimes.
The number of civil wars and latent civil
wars shows that, for many leaders, the current
situation is no more than a repeat of earlier
forms of agitation. At worst it is a transitional
period to be got through with a minimum of
damage by means of a judicious combination of
intransigence and vague promises.
Paths of transition
The increasingly hard line taken by several
governments may be the swan-song of dying
regimes. Nevertheless these regimes are one of
the great question marks hanging over the tran¬
sition to democracy in Africa. Other are trying
to prolong their hold on power by means of a
constitutional facelift.
One course that was followed in the late
1970s with the support of the Western powers,
which had no desire to lose partners with a
reputation for reliability, was for countries to
"liberalize" their ruling parties without calling
into question the principle of the one-party
state or the quasi-dynastic nature of the
regimes. In some cases, however, this provided
an opportunity for part of the political class to 17

detach itself permanently from government.
Moreover, the revelation of all kinds of scandal
entailed many risks. By the start of the 1980s,
most regimes had abandoned this experiment.
Another model entails the imposition from
above of a multi-party system controlled by
those in power. African statesmen who choose
this model seem to think that controlled demo¬
cratization paying lip-service to the principle of
multi-party choice can protect the long-term
interests of the ruling oligarchy more securely
than thorough-going authoritarian rule. But
there have been surprises, as we saw recently in
Cape Verde, where President Aristides Pereira
and the African Party for the Independence of
Cape Verde, which had been in power since
independence in 1975, went over to a multi¬
party system in 1990 and lost a general election
held in January 1991.
Another phenomenon is to use a "national
conference" as an original framework for a pain¬
less transition to democracy. National confer¬
ences, the first of which was called to extricate
the rulers of Benin from a political and eco¬
nomic crisis caused by a wave of strikes that had
brought the country to a halt, subsequently
spread like wildfire throughout Africa. Two
were held in 1990 (in Benin and Gabon) and five
in 1991 (in Congo, Mali, Togo, Niger and
Zaïre). In other countries, notably Cameroon
and the Central African Republic, the call for a
national conference is the main plank in the
opposition platform.
The first of its kind, the Benin national
conference was hastily organized and was
dominated by a technocratic emphasis on legal
formalities and economic detail. Its chief busi¬
ness was to neutralize a corrupt and worn-out
ruling group, so as to have access to credit from
the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank, and France. A similar process took place
in Gabon and possibly in Mali.
In Congo, on the other hand, the confer¬
ence lasted three whole months, against the
wishes of the international financial organiza¬
tions. Regarded by some as an interminable
African talking shop, in many ways the Brazza¬
ville conference set an example for others. The
French historian Jean Chesneaux recently
pointed out, correctly, that any truly participa¬
tory democracy is time-consuming.
The time taken from coping with economic
emergencies and from the efficient despatch of
business was devoted to an in-depth scrutiny,
unprecedented in Africa, of the nation's his¬
tory. In Africa's present state of moral, political
and economic bankruptcy, there is a need for
stock-taking. Here, for the first time, a whole
country uncompromisingly examined the most
recent, and hence most shadowy and contro-

versial, phase of its history, one during which a
one-party state had decreed a monopoly over
information and its interpretation.
In my view, if democracy is the non-
conflictual resolution of social conflicts, it
requires a certain minimum of consensus to
achieve that end. No consensus has as much
force as one based on lucidity and a common
interpretation of crucial moments in a nation's
history. It is still too early to appreciate the full
significance of the new symbolism used at the
conference, which mingled Christian concepts
of forgiveness with the specifically African
pagan rite of "the washing of hands" above the
tomb of the ancestors after making confession.
This act traditionally sanctioned the renewal of
social bonds and the establishment of a new
social contract enabling the members of the
community to continue to live together and
respect clearly stated common values.
But many obstacles lie ahead. Perhaps they
are part of Africa's economic and social situa¬
tion. What should be a cause for anxiety is not
so much the economic crisis, which by defini¬
tion cannot last for ever, as the structure of eco¬
nomies long shaped by the demands of an un¬
equal division of labour and earnings. The
working people of Africa drew no profit from
economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s.
They know that the supposed reforms devised
by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank have not solved any of Africa's
development problems, since their aim is to
redress the external imbalances of the African
economies. Their social effects, on the other
hand, have been very serious for most of the
population.
A COMMON LABORATORY
There is therefore a serious short-term risk that
almost before the gulf separating the people
from the authoritarian oligarchs has been
bridged, another one will open between a
ruling class committed to technocratic modern¬
ization and the mass of the population. If it
does, the people will feel that they have again
been denied their "revolution".
Another major obstacle is the territorial
structure of the African states, which were
shaped a century in some cases only decades
ago, at the whim of Western diplomats, to suit
the interests of the great powers. Ethnic and
regional problems are everywhere in evidence.
In the 1960s, the Katanga and Kasai dramas
in Zaïre and the Biafra trauma in Nigeria, all of
them involving outside intervention, led African
political and intellectual elites to wholeheartedly
condemn "regionalism" and "tribalism". Things
are very different today. Frantic centralization 19

in the name of the nation-state has been one of
the foundations of the dictatorships that are
now embroiled in crisis. Ethnic and regional dis¬
content in Ethiopia, Angola, Congo, Zaïre and
Togo has, on the other hand, stimulated calls for
democracy. Ethnic parties represent a consider¬
able risk, but so does a form of Jacobinism that
in Africa as elsewhere would represent the
triumph of a technocratic bureaucracy over a
participatory democracy that would invest at
least a minimum of power and responsibility in
local hands.
The struggles, achievements, difficulties and
questions described above indicate that Africa
today is not so much a confused battlefield as a
laboratory. Will it be a laboratory which will
concentrate on its own specific and intractable
situation, while others look on or at best offer
encouragement? Or, in the heat of events, will
Africa become a forum where new questions of
universal importance can be addressed and
where democratic demands and formulae of
universal relevance can be worked out?
Many people both within and outside Africa
tend to look upon the continent as a unique
case. How convincing are their arguments?
Now that the foreign loans raised by the
post-independence governments have been
exhausted, at devastating cost for the peoples of
Africa, it looks as if African countries are be¬
coming introverted, turning back again to their
own political cultures, and testing the powers
of creativity and invention of both urban elites
and villagers. There is a desire for mutual
exchange and contact among African countries.
From Cotonou to Kinshasa, from Douala to
Antananarivo, from Brazzaville to Niamey,
from Monrovia to Addis Ababa, from Bangui
to Johannesburg, the similarities seem striking:
in each place the cast in the social drama is the
same, there are the same forms of mobilization,
confrontation and negotiation.
However, I should like to correct this
impression of an introverted Africa and to put
this appearance of total originality into perspec¬
tive. Africa is currently experiencing problems
that both the old democratic states and the
many countries of the "South" and "East"
which are now coming to democracy also have
to solve. There are three main problems. The
first is that of the relationship between formal
representative democracy (with all the attendant
risks of the confiscation of power by experts,
technocrats and politicians, all of whom are
nonetheless necessary to the process) and the
indispensable role of citizens in controlling and
participating in power. The second is that of
achieving a balance between centres of power,
such as parliaments and governments, and the
places where life is lived (businesses, residential
neighbourhoods, villages and regions). Here the
settling of the ethnic question is paramount.
Thirdly, there is the question of harmonizing, in
the exercise and guarantee of democracy,
"national" territories and wider community-
type groupings.
But Africa also needs to establish new bonds
to strengthen a democratic world order. This
will only come about on two conditions. On the
one hand, colonial practices which have always
played into the hands of the African dictator¬
ships must be repudiated. On the other, aggres¬
sive and insidious forms of ideological and poli¬
tical paternalism must be done away with. Q

IN Brazil there has long been a profound

formal democratic system. In the nineteenth

and 1964 and 1985, there have always been
elections and a plurality of political parties. The
fact remains that people have always tended to
emphasize the problems of democracy rather
than its stability and the strength of its roots.
The noted Brazilian historian Sergio Buarque
de Holanda liked to say that democracy "is a
delicate plant, and has great difficulty growing
in the tropics".
In the so-called Third World countries,
even when a regime has had leaders chosen on
the basis of elections between representatives of
different parties, it has always been criticized
by someone, not without justification, on the
grounds of its "elitist" or "oligarchical" cha¬
racter. In such cases, fragile democratic institu¬
tions were confronted with political realities
such as the existence of systems of patronage,
lack of real freedom for society's underdogs,
and the artificiality of political parties.
These criticisms contain an element of truth.
But in the light of world events during the last
ten years, I wonder whether it is not the dicta¬
torships and authoritarian regimes rather than
the democracies that have turned out to be frag¬
ile. Dictatorships, as recent history shows, end
up being less durable than democracy, which is
increasingly becoming a universal value.
In his "Dictionary of Politics",1 Norberto
Bobbio reviews the various meanings of the
word democracy from ancient Greece to the
present day, and concludes by emphasizing the
dichotomy between democracy as an egalita¬
rian ideal and democracy as a method in
other words between democracy as a value and
democracy as a mechanism. But his comments
were made before the current great debate
about the transition to democracy in eastern
Europe. If he were writing now, he would per¬
haps comment that it is vain to think of merg¬
ing these two meanings of democracy.
Nevertheless, I think he would primarily
emphasize the key role of freedom, both in
theory and in practice. It is freedom, far more
than a definition of new rules of democracy,
that has fostered the democratization process in
eastern Europe, led to the downfall of anachro¬
nistic dictatorships in Greece, Spain and 21

Portugal, and encouraged the fight against
authoritarianism in Latin America. It still moti¬
vates the struggle for democratization, particu¬
larly in Asia and some of the newly industria¬
lized countries such as the Republic of Korea.
All the same, we need to analyse rather
more deeply the different processes of transi¬
tion to democracy that are taking place today. I
shall confine myself to those in Latin America,
with which I am directly acquainted, but I shall
compare them with those in eastern Europe.
Apart from the aspirations to freedom which
are common to them both, I see only differ¬
ences between them.
In Poland in 1981 I observed at first hand the
final stage of the events which led to the Gdansk
agreements between Lech Walesa and the
management of the Lenin naval shipyard. I
drove to Gdansk from Warsaw, where I was
attending a meeting of the International Sociolo¬
gical Association, in order to take a closer look at
the strike. I remember that what surprised and
even shocked me were the symbols displayed in
the streets effigies of the Pope, Polish flags
from pre-people's democracy days, and lighted
candles. Was this a return to the past?
Then I remembered the events of May 1968
in France, which took place while I was a pro¬
fessor of sociology at the University of Nan-
terre just outside Paris. On the barricades in
Paris, at demonstrations by students, workers
and others, the Internationale was always sung.
"Debout, ô damnés de la terre!" ("Arise ye
starvelings from your slumbers!") intoned
well-fed crowds led by young people waving
black anarchist flags.
The antecedents of the two movements, like
their socio-economic contexts, were different.
But they shared the same mixture of symbols,
simultaneously contemporary and anachro¬
nistic, which sought to express a message that
still lacked a vocabulary and a fixed grammar.
In each case there was a powerful reaction
against ossified structures and a tremendous
longing to turn over a page of history.
Making the transition to democracy
But the quest for greater freedom is not the
only factor in contemporary history. There are
others, including components of what I call
substantive democracy (to distinguish it from
formal democracy), which implies health, edu¬
cation and general welfare for the masses. Yet
both in eastern Europe and in Latin America,
despite their different situations, efforts to
build a democratic political system come up
against the same agonizing problem: can demo¬
cracy exist in a society paralysed by an eco¬
nomy in which penury is rife?
Before answering this crucial question, we
need to be clear about the differences between
the forms of transition to democracy found in
the two regions. In Latin America the transi-

tion has neither jeopardized the market eco¬
nomy nor sought to change it; indeed, the
changes that have occurred there have streng¬
thened the market. In eastern Europe the situa¬
tion is totally different: as well as acquiring
more freedom and more democratic rules,
society and the economy must also be rebuilt.
In the Latin American countries, attempts
to reform society and the economy take place
in the context of an already existing civil
society, competition between companies, and
efforts to move away from a system of patron¬
age which pervades the world of politics. Latin
American societies are much more like those of
western Europe and the United States than
those of eastern Europe where (particularly in
the ex-USSR, which experienced seventy years
of communist government), civil society has to
be recreated from scratch.
In order to move into the democratic phase,
the first item on the political agenda must be to

channel the urge for freedom into the construc¬
tion of state and non-state institutions which fit
into the Madisonian tradition of checks and
balances. In a way this is easier to achieve in
Latin America, where the state, even if authori¬
tarian, has not destroyed the market and non-
state organizations have been preserved, than it
is in eastern Europe, where the democratic
drive comes from limited sections of the intelli¬
gentsia and groups within the dominant party
"contaminated" by the new ideas. But what
really set the ball rolling was the aspiration of
the masses for freedom and consumer goods.
In Latin America, since major economic
reforms had not been introduced and the back
of the dictatorships (i.e. the military) had not
been broken, the transition boiled down to a
mammoth negotiation between the old masters
and the new and there has been no real break in
continuity. In terms of institutions, Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and even Paraguay, had
to revert to democratic practices and curb the
influence of the old rulers without excluding
them altogether.
The forces working for democracy in Latin
America met resistance from within the state,
but found support in the already existing civil
society which coexisted with the dictatorship
(trade unions, universities, companies, the
media and even political parties). In eastern
Europe, on the other hand, when the party-
state broke up, civil society had to be comp¬
letely reinvented, not reinstated.
Here I should like to mention a thesis that is
relevant today, although many democrats dis¬
like it. It is based on the theory of elites of the
Moravian-born U.S. economist Joseph Schum-
peter, who believed that democracy exists
when rival groups struggle for power and com¬
pete for votes. Voting not only has to be intro¬
duced, but competition has to be organized by
elites which identify objectives and put them to

the people, who make a choice. Rules made by
the majority are observed, and minorities res¬
pected. Continuity and alternation in what the
Italian sociologist and jurist Gaetano Mosca
calls the "political class" are not only guaran¬
teed but prescribed by electoral competition.
Freedom even on an empty stomach
Now in both Latin America and eastern Europe
dictatorships have wrought havoc in the sense
that they have largely destroyed elites. Recon¬
structing these elites is a necessary precondition
for the revival of democratic institutions. Learn¬
ing how to manage social groups and get them
to express their feelings and interests without
falling into blind corporatism is a long and
thankless process; but it is the essential tool for
any democratization.
This brings me to the crux of the matter: the
rising tide of popular demands. Democratiza¬
tion by definition opens the floodgates of
society. What happens then? In eastern Europe,
where totalitarianism was stronger and inequa¬
lities are less pronounced, popular demands are
for more freedom and participation, and so are
aimed mainly at the state and government. In
Latin America, where inequalities are glaring,
demands are for better jobs, better pay and
better public services.
But in both cases penury is intolerable
when it goes beyond limits set by the people
and by the capacity of productive forces to
satisfy demand. Here the debate about sub¬
stantive democracy and formal democracy
crops up again, although in different terms.
The prospects for constructing a democratic
political system in which people enjoy a full
range of freedoms are reduced where there is
no prosperity. In eastern Europe libertarian
aspirations have until now meant that demo¬
cratic values have been preserved even on an
empty stomach; but in Latin America, where
inflation and unemployment are rife, and
crises, exhaustion of public funds and a large
external debt are commonplace, the mainte¬
nance of an open and democratic society is a
tour de force.
This is the finest lesson the twentieth cen¬
tury can pass on to the next millennium. We
have discovered the fragility of dictatorships,
and also that peoples nowadays want freedom,
even on short commons. They are ready to
endure penury because they realize that lack
of freedom offers them only an ersatz pros¬
perity and robs them of the benefits of citizen¬
ship. But beyond a certain threshold the
necessary correlation between formal demo¬
cracy and substantive democracy becomes
unavoidable. Q

The /besr it/ay io ai/o/d drowning in our own waste is to produce as
little of it as possible. Tliis calls for efficient technology and invest¬
ment, but there is no time to lose. The automobile industry has
already taken some steps in the search for a solution. There are 500
million vehicles on the planet, 80 per cent ofwhich are private cars.
Most manufacturers are now showing some concern about the ugly
wrecks that disfigure the environment everywhere from Mali to Sri
Lanka. It is easy to recast scrap metal and to recycle plastic parts. One
multinational corporation is offering an 85 per cent recyclable model.
The big German car-makers are using readability as a sales pitch.
In a recently published brochure, the international organization
Greenpeace notedfurther examples ofgood practices in other sectors. In
Bielefeld, Germany, 90 per cent of the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) used in
the construction ofpublic buildings has been replaced by wood, ceramic
material, linoleum and clay, a move that has turned out to be particu¬
larly cost-effective. In the United States, the city ofPortland, Oregon, has
banned the use ofexpanded polystyrene. The 2,200 restaurants that had
been serving hamburgers in packaging made of this material have had
to find other solutions such as washable crockery or containers made of
recycled paper. Most customers approved. A Swedish paperfactory uses
oxygen to bleach the pulp so as to avoid using chlorine, which affects the
ozone layer. Even though the paper is a shade darker than the usual
white, publishers have willingly agreed to use it. As a result, Sweden has
reduced its use ofchlorine by 25 per cent.
In 1989, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
launched a Cleaner Production Programme, the objectives ofwhich are
"to increase worldwide awareness of the cleaner production concept,
help governments and industry develop cleaner production
programmes, foster the adoption of cleaner production, and facilitate
the transfer of cleaner production technologies." The programme
contains five features: the International Cleaner Production
Information Clearinghouse (ICPIC), which the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) updates continuously;
working groups on leather-tanning, solvents, pulp and paper,
petroleum, and biotechnology, among other specific topics; a newsletter,
Cleaner Production; training activitiesfor governments and industrial¬
ists, and finally, technical assistance for developing countries. This
important programme deserves to be more widely known.

In the United States, a farmers'
co-operative in Michigan came up
with the unusual idea of using
cherry pits as fuel for its fruit-
processing plant. Under this plan,
1.5 million kilograms of waste will
save $321,000 a year. The pits are
shredded, dried, and then com¬
pressed into briquettes. Their rich
mix of methane, hydrogen and
carbon monoxide content is used to
fire a boiler, and the steam pro¬
duced drives a turbine that gener¬
ates electricity. Among its other
advantages, the system reduces
waste and saves energy.
Rapid industrialization in the last
thirty years has led to serious envi¬
ronmental degradation in twelve
Brazilian states, where poor air qua¬
lity, contaminated drinking water,
and toxic wastes are a health
hazard. Heavy industries such as
steel, petroleum, petrochemicals,
fertilizers and coal mining, are the
leading contributors to pollution.
According to Samia El Baroudy,
Senior Country Officer for Brazil at
the World Bank, "industrial pollu¬
tion is a very serious problem for
the Brazilian people, more so than
deforestation. ... It reduces life
expectancy and the productivity of
the workforce, while increasing
disease and infant mortality." The
World Bank has granted loans for
the development of environmen¬
tally-sound economic growth
through a number ofprojects, ten of
which are currently being imple¬
mented. Twelve more are in the
pipeline.

According to Greenpeace, waste
produced by 71 million persons gets
poured into the Baltic Sea annually.
The landlocked sea also serves as a
dump for 200,000 tonnes of carbon
chloride per year from the paper
industry, 1 million tonnes ofnitrogen
from fertilizers, and 50,000 tonnes
ofphosphorus from detergents.

It is often said that biological diversity is endan¬
gered because of demographic growth, expanding
human settlements, the impoverishment of ecosys¬
tems by people, and the inadequacy of the laws and ins¬
titutions set up to protect it. Another factor is the ram¬
pant growth of certain plants which are introduced
into ecosystems and prey on species that are already
established there. Two such plants are the tropical
alga Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean, and a
plant which in Cameroon is called ndognmo, kon-
dengui or Laos weed, and which stifles other vegetation
and is of no use to humans or animals. In Australia, a
species of St-Iohn's-wort, introduced by a Frenchman
nostalgic for a plant that he knew in his homeland, is
proliferating and, as it is poisonous to livestock, pre¬
sents a threat to stockraising. Such thoughtless acts can
have incalculable consequences.

ISSUES AT A GUNCE
A remarkable set ofeight posters has been produced by Unesco and UNEP in the framework
of their International Environmental Education Programme. Each poster presents an envi¬
ronmental issue in a nutshell, illustrated with beautiful photos, drawings and diagrams. The
eight topics are climate change, fresh water, oceans and coastal areas, deforestation and
desertification, biological diversity, the environmental effects of industry, quality of life, and
environmental education. The complex issues presented are so clearly explained and laid out
that they can be taken in at a glance. The set is distributed to educational institutions free of
charge, in English only for the time being, by Unesco's Environmental Education Section, 7 Place
de Fontenoy, F75700 Paris
Following a campaign launched
by the secretariat of the United
Nations Conference on Environ¬
ment and Development at Rio de
Janeiro, Unesco has already col¬
lected the signatures of over nine
million individuals personally com¬
mitting themselves to the protec¬
tion of the planet. Director-General
Federico Mayor wrote to all Unesco
Member States inviting them to
organize seminars in educational
institutions in order to get young
people involved. Activities for pro¬
moting endorsement of the Earth
Pledge include the translation of
the Pledge into local languages, the
organization ofseminars, theatrical
performances, essay and painting
competitions, trips to forests, tree
planting, and campaigns to keep
schools, cities, and their surround¬
ings clean. Unesco National
Commissions are acting as focal
points for the project.
America's love affair with the
automobile was never any secret in
Los Angeles. Built around the car,
the Californian megalopolis is the
biggest gas guzzler in the world. Its
13 million residents drive 9 million
cars over 386 million kilometres a
day, using up 68 million litres of
gasoline and diesel fuel, and pro¬
ducing 60 per cent of the city's noto¬
rious smog. Environmental educa¬
tion programmes aimed at drivers
have met with some success though
not enough, and so the South Coast
Air Quality Management District
has further extended its campaign
in favour of ride-sharing and car-
pools, even offering financial incen¬
tives. Parking around shopping
centres, concert halls or stadiums,
for instance, is free or at a discount
for carpoolers, while an extra charge
is made for lone drivers. Electric
cars are also being promoted to help
reduce daily fuel consumption.

The Garbage
Museum at the
Meadowlands
Environment
Centre in New
Jersey (United
States).
Öur ancestors used objects
made of wood, which rotted,
and iron, which rusted. Today
we produce durable materials
like stainless steel and plastic,
but instead of being delighted at
how tough they are and holding
on to them as long as possible, we
throw them away at the earliest
opportunity, egged on by manu¬
facturers. In his book The Waste
Makers the American writer
Vance Packard quotes the indus¬
trial designer Brook Stevens as
saying: "Our whole economy is
based on planned obsolescence	
28
It isn't organized waste. It's a
sound contribution to the
American economy."
The more developed a country
is, the more waste it produces.
Waste is an excellent standard-of-
living indicator. Because we are
generating a rising tide of it and
because it is a significant source
of pollution, it has also become a
major cause for concern to
governments all over the planet.
The Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD) has drawn up the follow¬
ing categories for waste classifica¬
tion: municipal (mainly house
hold) waste; industrial waste; resi¬
due from the production of
energy; hospital and agricultural
waste, mining spoil and demoli¬
tion debris; dredge spoil, and
sewage sludge. (Nuclear wastes are
generally dealt with separately.)
We don't all throw away the
same amount of garbage. The
average person gets rid of 300 kg
of waste per year in Italy, 400 kg
in Japan, 600 kg in Finland, 860 kg
in the United States, and only 180
kg in Yaounde, Cameroon. But all
of these figures are constantly
rising.
The results of a survey conduct-
ed in France by CREDOC, the
French centre for the study and
observation of living conditions,
give some idea of the kind of
things that are thrown out: 34 per
cent is organic matter, 30 per cent
paper and cardboard, 13 per cent
glass, 10 per cent plastic, 7 per
cent metal, 4 per cent wood and 2
per cent textiles.
In the industrialized member
countries of OECD, where 90 to
100 per cent of garbage collection
is carried out by municipal author¬
ities, people tend not to worry
about what happens to their house¬
hold waste. Either it ends up in
an official dump, or landfill, or it
is taken to an incineration plant.
Storage and treatment capacities,
however, are under increasing
pressure because of the amounts
involved 423 million tonnes for
the OECD countries alone in
1989. With the spread of the
NIMBY ("Not in my back yard")
syndrome people are refusing to
live in the vicinity of landfills and
incineration plants, and it is
becoming virtually impossible to
build new plants. The odours
from landfills, and the endless
procession of trucks going to and
fro unquestionably represent a
serious disamenity to residents in
the immediate vicinity, not to
mention potential health hazards,
which are only now becoming the
subject of epidemiological stu¬
dies. Solutions must be found.
The first solution is to sort out
waste at source. Several garbage
bins in the kitchen, special
containers in the street, and a
well-organized selective collec¬
tion system are keys to efficient
recycling and to the conservation
of energy and raw materials.
Paper, glass and metal can easily
be sorted in this way. Plastic,
which is totally non-biodegra¬
dable, is very difficult to recycle.
Organic substances, as anyone
who has a garden knows, can be
allowed to decay for use as com¬
post to fertilize the soil.
Such an attitude to recycling
implies that we should all be
aware of the problem and make a
daily effort to solve it. This can
only become a habit if there is
considerable educational back¬
up. We can do our marketing with
our own bags or baskets and
refuse to accept plastic bags,
which are not a negligible source
of pollution. Another solution
would be to make it compulsory
for stores to take back cartons and
other forms of packaging, to
encourage the charging of a
deposit on glass and even plastic
bottles, the re-use of metal and
plastic containers and the sale of
unpackaged goods.
We have to act now, before we
are submerged in our own waste. A
recent example concerning the
German city of Ulm, in Bavaria, is
highly instructive. Ulm was export¬
ing 160 tonnes of household waste
daily to two landfills in France,
when it came to light that unscru¬
pulous carriers were mixing dan¬
gerous hospital or industrial waste
into their loads, and some were
even secretly dumping them at

beauty spots. France decided to
call a halt to this traffic. The Ulm
authorities could have built an
incinerator, but the proposal had
been vetoed by environmentalists,
who also opposed the establish¬
ment of a landfill. Now there is no
alternative but to build an incine¬
rator. However, construction will
take three years, and during this
period, garbage will pile up in and
around the city.
The most ordinary garbage bin
contains all sorts of hazardous,
toxic chemical substances found
in solvents, adhesives, batteries,
oven cleansers, disinfectants,
medicines, pesticides, and other
products. Once garbage has been
incinerated, the metals in it
such as lead, chrome, mercury or
arsenic remain and can easily
filter into the natural environ¬
ment if the ash is not perfectly
stored.

NEP notes that out of the
more than 10 million chemi¬
cal compounds that have
been synthesized worldwide
J since the turn of the century,
100,000 have been marketed. In
addition, between 1,000 and 2,000
new compounds are produced
each year. Some of them, such as
pesticides or fertilizers, are used
straight, but most of them enter
into the composition of millions of
ordinary consumer goods. Every
sector of human activity uses and
benefits from these products.
And yet it has been known for
thirty years that all chemical pro¬
ducts are to some degree hazard¬
ous. How seriously they affect
health depends on how deadly
they are and on the duration of
exposure to theip. A brief expo¬
sure to a tiny amount of dioxin,
for instance, is enough to make
people ill, whereas they have to
be exposed to high doses of fer¬
rous oxide for a long period of
time for its ill-effects to be felt.
Scientists have recently begun to
focus more attention on long-
term effects such as birth defects,
adverse genetic and neurological
changes, and forms of cancer.
A tragic illustration of the
consequences of careless waste-
dumping occurred in Minamata,
on the Japanese island of Kyushu,
where between 1956 and 1967 an
industrial plant dumped its waste
in the sea. The waste contained
mercury, which was absorbed by
plankton, then by the small fish
on which the big ones feed, lead¬
ing to a mercury concentration
in the food chain. As a conse¬
quence, 20,000 people were affect¬
ed by nervous disorders, and 857
of them died. The problem is par¬
ticularly disturbing since infor¬
mation about the effects on
health is available for only 2 per
cent of the chemical compounds
on the market.
The substances that contami¬
nate soil, water and air can cover
long distances, regardless of bor¬
ders. This is a matter of concern
for the whole planet. 29

The world produces 2.1 billion
tonnes of industrial waste per
year, 338 million tonnes of
which are hazardous. A highly
industrialized country like the
United States contributes 275
million tonnes to the total, com¬
pared with only 22,000 tonnes from
Thailand. Before the international
community became aware of the
danger, the least expensive solu¬
tion had been to dispose of waste
anywhere on land or at sea. When
the warning signal rang out, an¬
other solution appeared, and that
was to dump the waste, often under
a false identity, in acquiescent host
countries. UNEP estimates that 23
tonnes ofwaste cross the border of
an OECD member country every
five minutes. The international
30 M
hazardous-waste trade reached a
peak in the 1980s, with the media
reporting on the trials and tribula¬
tions ofships such as the Khian Sea
and the Zanoobia as they criss¬
crossed the oceans for months,
sometimes for years at a time, seek¬
ing a developing country that
could be persuaded to accept their
cargoes ofwaste.
The international organization
Greenpeace, whose members
condemn these immoral if not
illegal practices, has conducted a
wide-ranging inquiry, as thorough
as a police investigation, and pub¬
lished the findings in 1990 in a 400-
page volume. A very poor country
like Guinea Bissau would have had
to be heroic to turn down four times
its Gross National Product and
twice its foreign debt in return for
accepting 15 million tonnes of
industrial waste that could easily
be stored on a plain near the
Senegalese border. In fact, geolo¬
gical studies revealed that the
groundwater in that area is just
below the surface, and the Health
Minister called for the deal to be
suspended.
Another waste-traffic incident
took place in 1988 when household
waste ash from the city of
Philadelphia on the eastern sea¬
board of the United States was
"sold" to Guinea, which was then
in the midst of national recon¬
struction, to manufacture bricks. A
15,000-tonne shipment was
unloaded directly onto the ground
on the island ofKassa, offConakry.
The United States Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA) ana¬
lysed the content of the ash and
published a report which was
intended to be reassuring but which
recommended that the public and
unprotected workers should not
have access to the area where it was
stored. Perhaps because the
imported ash was ultimately consid¬
ered to be a health hazard, or
because it was unsuitable for brick-
manufacturing, or because of a
campaign launched by Guiñean
television, it was finally shipped
back to Philadelphia.
Waste is moved mainly for eco¬
nomic reasons. The "commodity" is
handled by mysterious brokers and
can yield almost as much profit as
gunrunning or drug trafficking
without the attendant risks. It is also
good business for industrialists to
transport their waste to a country
with much cheaper storage rates
($40 a tonne inAfrica, 25 times more
in Europe, and 36 times more in the
United States), or where recycling
costs less ($20 a tonne in France, as
opposed to $100 in Germany).
There may be an incentive to avoid
the particularly strict regulations
applied in so-called "green" coun¬
tries. The temptation then is to ship
waste to the East or the South,
because regulations still do not exist
in many Third World countries.
And yet, as far back as 1981, a
group ofexperts met in Montevideo,
Uruguay, to examine the transport,
handling and storage of hazardous
waste. In 1984 and 1985, UNEP drew
up a series of Guidelines and
Principles for Environmentally
Sound Management of Hazardous

Wastes. These efforts crystallized in
the 1989 Basel Convention on the
control of transboundary move¬
ments ofhazardous wastes and their
disposal. Although the Convention
was adopted by 116 countries and
the European Community, it has not
yet been ratified by the main waste
producing countries in otherwords
it has not been incorporated into
their national law.
The Convention was given an
added regional dimension in 1989
by the Lomé IV Convention be¬
tween African, Caribbean and
Pacific nations and the European
Community, and by the Bamako
Convention in 1991. The Basel
Convention, which came into force
in 1992, has been criticized as luke¬
warm, notably by Greenpeace.
Waste import and export are still
permitted. They are authorized be¬
tween states that have signed the
treaty provided they are preceded
by an exchange of detailed inform¬
ation on the intended export and
the written consent of the importing
country. Bilateral agreements may
also be reached by signatory coun¬
tries with each other and with a
non-signatory country, as long as
they are "environmentally sound".
Even if the Convention is a step in
the right direction, there is not a
single clause in it, as Greenpeace
points out, that bans any transfer
of waste (except to the Antarctic),
even to a developing country or a
country that has more flexible envi¬
ronmental laws than the exporting
country. Only time will tell whether
the Basel Convention will discour¬
age the sinister trade in hazardous
waste once and for all.

stories

Azeri into
Russian (1962).

The comic stories featuring
Nasrudin Hodja, who is
thought to have lived in
Anatolia in the thirteenth
century, are celebrated
worldwide for their wry
humour. Full of mischief,
which led him into all sorts of
amusing and sometimes hair-
raising scrapes, Nasrudin
became a legendary folk hero,
a "jester" whose irreverent
attitude to life is a form of
wisdom.
The story on this page appears in an anthology
entitled Compagnons du Soleil ('Companions of the
Sun") co-published (in French) by Uxesco , Editions de la
Découverte (Paris) and the Fondation pour le progrès de
l'Homme. Ttie anthology has been prepared under the
general editorship of the African historian Joseph Ki-
Zerbo, in collaboration with Marie-Josèphe Beaud.
One day, Nasrudin Hodja had bought a
piece of liver and was taking it back home.
On the way, he met a friend who said to
him:
"Let me write you down a wonderful
recipe for cooking liver and you'll find what
a mouth-watering meal it will make for
you!"
Without more ado, he took out a piece of
paper from his pocket and wrote out the
most marvellous recipe.
Hodja was delighted at his stroke ofgood
fortune and went cheerfully on his way,
already licking his lips at the thought of
eating such a delicious stew.
Suddenly, a great hawk swooped down
out of the sky and snatched the piece of liver
out ofhis hand with its powerful claws.
Completely taken aback at being robbed
ofhis tasty morsel, Nasrudin Hodja held out
his right hand and brandished the piece of
paper at the thieving bird as it sped away
and, barely concealing his disappointment,
cried out:
"Don't count your blessings too soon. You
can't make a meal of that liver because I've
got the recipe. Here it is!"

I POLAND I A DIFFICULT
by WadyslawAdamski TRANSITION
New Age Pyramid (1989), a
work by the Czechoslovak
sculptor Pavel Homolka.
(Cast glass and foamed
silicate mould.)
THE spectacular breakdown of state socia¬
lism in eastern Europe has, for the first
time since the end of the Second World
War, given the people of the region an oppor¬
tunity to freely choose their way of life and
build anew their social, economic and political
institutions. It should not, however, be taken
for granted that this new opportunity will
automatically result in a truly democratic and
pluralistic social order.
When Poland and Hungary regained their
sovereignty, the first nations of the region to do
so, the new governments proclaimed their dedi¬
cation to the free-market economy and political
democracy. The other countries soon followed
this pattern. But this was merely the first step;
there is still a long way to go. It is certain that
further progress will be difficult, since the newly
constituted governments will have to implement
their democratic creed in extremely unfavour¬
able circumstances. The new authorities, which
'^Síí*
have inherited ruined economies and need to
impose harsh austerity policies, will inevitably
have to cope with recurring waves of populist
discontent, thereby risking the loss of their posi¬
tions in free elections.
In the long run, however, the most crucial
task is that of restructuring basic economic and
social institutions. This means that new owners
must be found for state enterprises and that the
institutions of civil society, hitherto virtually
non-existent, will have to be created from
scratch. And all these goals must be achieved
quickly, in societies almost totally deprived of a
modern business and middle class, not to men¬
tion competent managers, political leaders and
organizers of civic institutions independent of
the state.
The question of which sections of society
will support or oppose the reforms is crucial. In
Poland, the Solidarity movement was nurtured
by the sense of deprivation and anger felt by
state employees when they compared their
own situation with that of those they regarded
as being unjustly privileged the representa¬
tives of power. This feeling was reinforced by
the obvious discrepancies between the actual
situation and the ideological principle of the
system, which maintained that rewards should
be distributed according to "work and social
usefulness".
The alliance of the Polish working class and
the proletarianized intelligentsia, embodied in
the Solidarity movement, was strong enough to
paralyse the Party's ability to exercise its
monopoly on power. At the same time, the
strength of the alliance was limited. It expressed
itself mainly in negative ways such as by boy¬
cotting the government's decisions and forcing
it to make concessions.
What lessons can be drawn from this? What
are the possibilities of transforming the social
behaviour that helped to demolish state socia¬
lism into positive action in a context of demo¬
cratic institutions?
The best way to approach this question is to
look at privatization strategies. How much pri¬
vatization do we really need and at what speed
should it be implemented? Most important of
all, what role in this process should be played
by those who contributed to the breakdown of
totalitarianism? 33

It seems to me that any attempt to solve
these problems requires linking them to their
structural background. Prospects for the devel¬
opment of civil society and political democracy
in Poland depend on how well we understand
the type of social conflict that emerged between
Solidarity and the former Party-State appa¬
ratus. This conflict, seen at the time as a clear-
cut dichotomy between "us" and "them", still
affects the post-communist governments.

government and, at right,
Lech Walesa, the strike

(31 August 1980).
A REVOLUTION
FROM BELOW
The main reason for this seems to be the failure
of new governments to absorb discontented
workers into the process of reform. There is
growing support from the public and from
skilled workers for free-market and efficiency-
oriented policies. Most state employees, on the
other hand, still express an attachment to
"social justice" or egalitarian principles.
These tendencies show how far the standards
and values of the old system have been eroded.
And paradoxically, those most responsible for its
collapse have been the very people whose social
advancement it favoured. Thus, from its begin¬
nings in the 1940s, the system contained within it
the seeds of its own downfall.
Workers and intellectuals began to behave
unpredictably as the system of pay and perqui¬
sites began to break down. As the old order
collapsed, the economy began spontaneously to
adjust to the requirements of the market. The
Polish Round Table negotiations of February-
April 1989, and especially Solidarity's victory
in the election of June 1989, might have been
expected to carry this process further.
However, it soon became clear that in the tran¬
sition period governments were encountering
apathy and even resistance. The hostility was
more pronounced among state employees than
among the former nomenklatura.
The new situation raises fresh problems. In
creating a democratic system in Poland, what
role should be played respectively by sponta¬
neous movements and by political action
undertaken by those in power? Should we
expect the revolution to take place from below
or from above? Basing my analysis on the
Polish experience, I would suggest that the
most likely way of achieving a change in the
system is neither from above nor from below
alone, but through a mixture of the two.
A real revolution from below took place in
Poland. What has happened to it since Solida¬
rity's victory? Has the spontaneous movement
exhausted its potential? Should the working-
class rebels now be disregarded and ignored? I
do not think so, even if the alliance between
workers and intellectuals has weakened consid¬
erably since many of Solidarity's leaders entered
the state political institutions. The workers, who
carried out the revolution, should not be ignored
as a force for democratic change. The problem is
finding a way of transforming their experience
in a protest movement into constructive partici¬
pation in the process of social reconstruction. If
no solution is found, these powerful social
forces will either openly oppose or, at the very
least, boycott the rebuilding of Polish society.

THE SOUTH
AN
ELUSIVE
IDEAL
byRomila Thapar
Right, Marks of Hope, a
polychrome wood engraving
by the Korean woman artist
Ja Rhee Seund.
THE democratic ideal has never been fully
translated into practice. Many so-called
democratic societies in the past were
hijacked and became oligarchies in which
democratic rhetoric was used to preserve the
fiction that the ruling group represented the
majority. The Greek city states, for example,
are often cited as the first democracies, but it is
conveniently forgotten that in them slaves
often outnumbered free citizens and were nei¬
ther represented nor had any rights. In the light
of historical experience, how can democracy be
adapted to the circumstances of the late twen¬
tieth century?
In modern times democracy has often been
associated with the nation-state. But perhaps
we should not overlook the experience of the
smaller social and political units which in the
past have been run on quasi-democratic lines.
Those who sought to endow the nation-
state with an identity by associating it with the
middle class or with a regional, linguistic,
ethnic or even religious group, claimed to be
doing so in the name of democracy. Sometimes,
it has been argued, these communities were fic¬
titious and their ostensible identity camou¬
flaged hidden aspirations. By equating the
group's identity with nationalism, national and
democratic causes coalesced. But in these
nation-states the functioning of democracy was
limited by the nationalism with which they
were linked. Now that the nation-state is
increasingly being questioned, should we also
question democracy or certain kinds of
democracy?
One question that might be asked is wheth¬
er democracy presupposes secularism. In many
parts of the world, religion is now being politi¬
cally manipulated on an unprecedented scale.
In saying this I am not objecting to people's
right to practice their faith, but to the way in
which various politicians and fundamentalists 35

have distorted this right. If questioning the
public function of religion necessarily leads to
secularism, then this could encourage the pro¬
motion of another approach to democracy,
particularly in societies where several religions
exist side by side.
Democracy implies both representation and
decisions based on the views of the majority.
But what constitutes a majority? If it is simply
a matter of the number of votes cast at elec¬
tions, this opens the way to vote-rigging or to
the mobilization of mass support by ideologies
that appear to espouse a variety of causes but in
reality are no more than a mechanism for
attracting and controlling large numbers of
people. I am thinking here of the kind of reac¬
tionary populism based on race or religion that
has time and again caused tensions and violence
in many parts of the world, both North and
South. In the interests of true democracy, it
would be worth considering how such move¬
ments can be prevented from imposing their
definition of majority rule, especially when
religious communities are exploited politically
as part of a supra-national hidden agenda.
The modern nation-state also faces the
problem of accommodating minority cultures,
which are increasingly aware that they cannot
be excluded from the democratic majority. This
problem is likely to become especially acute in
the industrialized countries, where sharply dif¬
fering groups have been forcibly brought to¬
gether through past colonial connections and
present economic needs, and where a numerical
majority is sometimes reduced to the status of a
political minority. In ex-colonies where such
conflicts are also known, the divergent groups
do at least normally share some common inher¬
itance and history.
The best way to understand the correlation
]]>

<![CDATA[
between culture and democracy is to examine
the manner in which individuals or groups
choose their identity and perceive the differ¬
ences between themselves and others. In part
this is the result of early socialization. It can
also spring from tension and conflicts, which
sharpen people's perception of their identity.
Why, incidentally, should the nation-state
insist on a single identity? After all, individuals
have multiple identities. The sterility of a single
identity could be replaced by a multi-faceted
one involving more complex social and cultural
patterns. A multi-faceted democracy would
also be more difficult to control politically.
Representational democracy often ends up
with power far removed from the individual
citizen. Now that cinema, television and
advertising have all got into the act, would-be
representatives of the people find themselves
addressing audiences they cannot even see.
A budding orator
in Haiti.
True representativity must be based on some
reference back to the electors, who must also
retain the right to recall their representatives,
if they so wish. These seemingly negative
rights can provide an essential corrective to the
tendency of representatives to turn into power-
brokers.
Beware of the watchdog
The collapse of some socialist economies has
led the peoples in the countries concerned
to a desperate hope that the free market will
protect them against the revival of totalitarian
regimes. But the experience of other countries
shows that the market cannot do this. Unfortu¬
nately, the market can equally well lend itself to
other kinds of dictatorial demand from
consumerism, the armaments industry, multi¬
national corporations and other interests. Such
demands, which undermine equality of oppor¬
tunity and social justice, can only be countered
by an equitable economic system and a legal
system that is accessible to all citizens and pre¬
vents the erosion of human rights and the
annulling of human dignity.
However, any system can be thwarted,
abused or rendered ineffective if those who
control it cannot be challenged. Institutions
which are expected to act as watchdogs often
end up by becoming a party to the abuses they
are supposed to prevent. The articulation of
dissent and protest is imperative for democratic
systems. Even in democratic societies, when
children are taught their rights and duties atten¬
tion is rarely drawn to their right to disagree.
Conformity is at a premium, and dissent is
frowned upon or ignored. The submissive sub¬
ject rather than the autonomous individual is
regarded as the ideal citizen.
In pleading the case of the autonomous
individual, I am not advocating an anarchic
society. Autonomous individuals do not set out
to destroy society; they are concerned with
changing it in creative ways. They do not
necessarily form part of the power structure
themselves, but they comment on it and if
needs be protest against specific actions taken
by those in power. As long as it is accepted that
there is room for moral authority as well as
political and social authority in the running of
society, such people will always have a place in
the democratic process. Q

IRAN RELIGION,
SECULARISM AND DEMOCRACY
byEhsanNaraghi
B
EHSAN NARAGHI,
founder of the Teheran
Institute of Social Research
and currently an adviser to
Unesco, ¡s an Iranian
sociologist and historian. His
published works include
L'Orient et la crise de
l'Occident (Paris, 1977) and
Des palais du chah aux
prisons de la révolution
(Paris, 1991). This article has
been extracted from his
latest book Enseignement et
changements sociaux en Iran
du 7° au 20" siècle, Islam et
laïcité, leçons d'une
expérience séculaire (Maison
des Sciences de l'Homme,
Paris, 1992).
EFORE the revolution of 1906, Iran's
public secular schools were the symbol
and crucible of democratic thought. The
aim of the revolutionaries at that time was to
increase the number of these schools, for they
knew that democracy could not take root in
Iranian soil without them. But an entrenched
landowning system resisted the expansion of
secular schooling in the rural areas where most
Iranians lived. Economically, politically, and
administratively, Iran's rural majority remained
under the thumb of major land holders. With
positions in parliament and power in the coun¬
tryside, even after the revolution, this class suc¬
cessfully opposed the spread of modern educa¬
tion on its turf.
In 1911, 'there were 125 public secular
schools in Teheran, with some 10,500 students.
There were about the same number of pupils in
secular education in the provinces. This repre
sented a mere two per cent of school-age chil¬
dren. The secular school system advocated by
the new regime therefore did not develop.
When Reza Shah Pahlavi (1878-1944) came to
power in 1925, he introduced his authoritarian
regime without great difficulty. While he
allowed secular schooling to develop to some
extent during his reign, the schools were
purged of democratic leavening and became
institutions whose main purpose was to train
state functionaries.
The same approach prevailed under his son,
Mohammad Reza Shah (1919-198Ö). The main
idea was to provide young people with degrees,
not to educate them as citizens. As a result,
while secular education had more than eight
million students enrolled on the eve of the
Islamic Revolution in 1979, it provided no bul¬
wark against the growing influence of religion.
The growth of secular schooling opened up

a socio-cultural abyss. Economic development,
the Shah's hobby horse, took no account of
cultural values or social relations. A form of
secularism that was hostile to participation in
political life and to culture was bound to pave
the way for an Islamic revolution, which would
declare itself able to fill the void by a return to
values anchored in Iranian society.
Under Reza Shah, traditional schools of
religious instruction, the madrasas, had shrunk
in number, but around ten thousand students
were enrolled in them. They offered the only
training for the clergy in Iran. All religious
ceremonies and practices came under the juris
diction of the marjataqlid, or guides, who were
taught in the traditional teaching establish¬
ments. They continued to exert an undoubted
influence, albeit reduced, throughout the reign
of the Pahlavisfrom 1925 until 1979.
The rupture
Religious and secular currents coexisted in the
school system for years. It was only in 1963,
with the expulsion of the ayatollah Khomeyni
(c.1900-1989) and his exile in Iraq, that the
confrontation between the regime and the mul¬
lahs became overt. The police intervened bru¬
tally in the school where Khomeyni taught and
arrested him.
Mohammad Reza Shah's regime prided
itself on its economic and social achievements;
in its eyes, the old days were finished and their
legacy was negligible. Meanwhile, the religious
bodies, under pressure from the bazaris, or tra¬
ditional merchants, were developing an "anti-
modernist" mentality that was notably hostile
to the regime. The bazaris did not fit well into
Iran's new economy, where a certain form of
private industrialization was favoured by state
protectionism. In particular, the export of tra¬
ditional Iranian staple products was slipping
out of their hands.
Pointing to the faults in this monopolistic
type of development, which favoured a thin
slice of society, clergy and bazaris began syste¬
matically to criticize the regime's accomplish¬
ments. The bazaris subsidized the works of the
mullahs (doctors of Qur'anic law), who were
duly grateful and gave them moral support.
This phenomenon took a special hold in the
cities, where many mosques were built.
Meanwhile, the state had no strategy for
assimilating the populations who, partly
because of demographic pressure, were flock¬
ing from the countryside into the cities. Few of
these newcomers could identify with a moder¬
nity increasingly based on foreign models and
symbols from which they felt alienated.
Thrown back onto traditional structures and
patterns of behaviour, they were easily
influenced by the mullahs, who exploited the
laxity of the media in order to win over this
population marginalized by technological pro¬
gress and an inegalitarian regime.
In its direct confrontation with the regime,
the Shiite clergy devised new methods and
encouraged the acquisition of new skills. A
1965 study on structures and teaching methods
in the religious schools of Qom, Mashad and
Teheran showed how students wanted to learn
foreign languages above all English but
refused to watch television or listen to the
radio, because they were the Voice of Power. 39

For the most part, these students came from the
lower classes for whom education was a means
of improving their social status.
In the absence of political parties, trade
unions or associations, which were banned by
the regime, the only possible setting tolerated
for communal activities was that of religion,
where uprooted country people found a fami¬
liar world whose language, symbols and struc¬
ture they understood. Moreover, the Shiite
clergy, adept at the dramatic use of rhetoric,
knew how to exploit the taste of illiterate Ira¬
nians for the spoken word. They used cassette
recordings with great skill.
Without directly attacking the Shah or the
regime, the mullahs managed to completely
debunk the lifestyle of the West by denying it
any legitimacy. The denunciation of certain
forms of behaviour as "satanic" (meetings be¬
tween the sexes, sports clubs, culture centres,
beaches, television and alcohol), went straight to
the hearts of conservative townspeople and of
the newly urbanized class that did not know
where it stood in relation to modern "Western"
life. The latter became a growing source of
anxiety, upsetting the moral values which people
from a traditional background hoped to instil in
their children, especially their daughters.
Unaware that this was happening, the Shah
talked on about the "great civilization" he
intended to build, while Islamic militants capi¬
talized on the malaise aroused by a lifestyle that
most of the population did not adopt. Under
the Pahlavis, people increasingly identified with
religion as the main defender of culture and the
Iranian community.
The lessons
of a dual experience
If in Iran, as in other parts of the world, reli¬
gion is engaged in a struggle against secular
society, it is partly because secularism has
claimed the right to assume the power that
once belonged to religion. The defence of cer¬
tain interests and moral traditions is as these
closing years of the century go to show the
last, and still very solid, bastion defended by
these religious forces. When the instruments of
emancipation become automatic or dogmatic,
and hence instruments of oppression, when
principles of social and moral justice are
systematically violated, religion, with its guid¬
ing spiritual and moral principles, aspires to
return to the centre of the stage.
In refusing to separate politics and faith,
clergy and state, transcendance and commu¬
nity, Islam presents itself as a way to combat
the disintegration of the social fabric in
contemporary societies. However, secularism
in Iran did not have its necessary concomitant
in the form of the exercise of democracy by all
citizens, the refusal of exclusion, the reduction
of privileges and social injustice, and respect for
freedom of thought. The vast majority of the
population was prey to a process of marginali-
zation on every front: social, economic, cultural
and political. Secularism in Iran led to a spiri¬
tual backlash.
As for Islam, which has today stepped into
the gap, its attitude is still defensive rather than
receptive, in spite of its claims to solve all prob¬
lems. There is a risk that it will exclude the
population from the modern world at a time
when new chapters are opening in history, eco¬
nomics, science, education and culture.
Secularists and Shiites should be fighting the
same battle, according to their own principles:
the battle for knowledge, which knows no
exclusion. Iran is the only country in the East to
have experienced two such extremes of social
organization, each in reaction to the other. Cer¬
tainly, Iranian men and women today have been
"enriched" in the sense that they have known
both experiences and their two underlying
conceptions: on the one hand earthly man, with
his responsibilities as citizen, and on the other,
spiritual man with his transcendent aspirations.
Can the lessons drawn from these two
conceptions experienced in daily life reconcile
the demands of the spirit and the need for
material progress? Or will they unleash a new
despair? The revolutionary ferment of ideas
and events seems to be dying down. Tradition
and revolution are not reason. They are visions
of man and society which leave traces. Perhaps
coming generations, educated in the ways of
history, will take a road that leads to spiritual
riches, as well to a better organized society.
May they lose nothing of what has been gained
from either side, .and be protected from the
darker aspects of each of them.

WOMEN'S ROLE IN
POST-INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
by Eleanora Masini Barbieri
ACCORDING to the American sociologist
Elise Boulding, there are three areas in
which the work of women has built
what she calls a "civic society" based on mutual
respect. The first is related to children and
teaching. In almost all societies, women are res¬
ponsible for the education of children up to
their seventh year. Psychologists agree that
these are the years in which the child's world-
vision is formed.
The second is related to women's hidden
economic role. Its arena may be the kitchen or
the garden, the small production unit which
played a crucial role in agricultural societies
and has also often been, though less visibly, the
salvation of the highly-industrialized societies
of our time.
The third area has also been largely unno¬
ticed. Women are and have been what Elise
Boulding calls the "cement of society". They
have fulfilled this role in private, in family life,
and even in dynastic alliances between villages
or towns over the centuries.
Boulding has described these areas, which
belong to the "underside of history", as
"society's green. space, its visioning space, its
bonding space. It is a space where minds can
learn to grapple with complexities that are des¬
troying the overside."
Women's efforts to build a viable society of
respect and understanding also contribute to
the creation of a democratic culture. Children
learn respect, tolerance, and other principles of
democratic behaviour at a very early stage, in
their relations with other members of the
family and the community. In this context, it is
interesting to observe and compare the atti¬
tudes of families in different parts of the world:
the strong community sense of the hierarchi¬
cally organized extended family in Africa, the
profound respect with which the elder mem¬
bers of the Chinese family are regarded, and the
focus on younger family members in modern 41

Italian sociologist, is the
Director of the Executive
Board of the World Futures

Forecasting at the Gregorian
University in Rome. Among
her works published in

Desirable Societies (1983).
Western society. Women play a central role in
the shaping of these attitudes through the way
they behave and the example they set. It is
because their public role has been invisible that
they have learned respect for others a respect
that encourages democratic behaviour rather
than the dominating behaviour often expected
of men. Respect does not, however, mean
accepting domination by others; it is coupled
with the demand that women be respected in
their turn.
Many examples could be cited of women's
civic spirit. Polish women contributed to the
rebuilding of Warsaw's schools after the
Second World War; Japanese women organized
support systems after Hiroshima, as did the
women of Mexico after the 1984 earthquake.
The concept of the democratic society devel¬
oped in the industrial era. Today, industrial
society appears to have reached its limits. The
natural environment has been exploited, espe¬
cially by the rich countries, in a way that cer¬
tainly cannot be called democratic. Nor have
people found happiness in material wealth, as is
clearly evident among the young people of the
wealthier countries of North America and
Europe. We have reached both external and
internal limits, to use a phrase coined by
Aurelio Peccei, the founder of the Club of
Rome. Our inner selves require answers that
are far more profound than those industrial
society has provided. In post-industrial society,
whatever form it takes, a new mentality will be
essential. We must use the many capacities of
people, and especially the specific capacities of
women, that are now untapped.
Women citizens of tomorrow
Post-industrial society will be a complex,
uncertain society, in which such tools and
methods of industrial society as specialization,
separation of tasks, hierarchical structures, and
mass production will no longer be relevant.
Notable among its features will be decentra¬
lized networks of small units, diversified activi¬
ties peformed by the same person or unit, and
rapidity of action.
The society of the future will require people
to be flexible. They will have to perform several
tasks at the same time. They will need to pos¬
sess a new sense of time. Production will be
"personalized" rather than "standardized". As
technology develops, people will have to learn
new tasks and skills during their working lives,
and in many cases to change jobs to keep pace
with technological change.
In this society women are bound to play an
ä^^^stj
increasingly important role, if only because in
almost every country they have a higher life
expectancy than men and head one-third of the
world's households. The future of many major
technological innovations, especially in bio¬
technology, will depend on whether women
accept or reject them.
Women possess many of the capacities that
will be needed in post-industrial society.
Research in various countries has shown that
they are particularly flexible and adaptable.
Since their life-cycle forces them to stop and
start work, often changing jobs, they are used
to change. They have to be versatile. In addi¬
tion to cooking, looking after the children, iron¬
ing and doing other household tasks, they
may also have a job to do at home sewing,
perhaps, in developing countries, computer
work in the industrialized world.
Women also tend to have a temporal
rhythm which is closer to real time than to
what Lewis Mumford called "clock time". This
capacity too will be increasingly important in
an overcrowded, unsynchronized society.
Women find it difficult to standardize their
]]>

Women have a strong sense of priorities. In
times of need or stress, they make choices rela¬
ting to their children and their future well-
being, rather than to short-term benefits. In
China, Canada, and in other countries with a
large migrant population, research has shown
that mothers faced with a range of choices put
their children's education first. In developing
countries, women's first priority might be
water or food for their children rather than
other economic benefits. There is also evidence
that women are less inclined to accept hierar¬
chical structures than men. This is important if,
as the American futurologist Alvin Toffler
believes, we are moving towards an increas¬
ingly egalitarian society.
Solidarity, the capacity to put first things
first, and the rejection of hierarchies are traits
that, if fostered rather than suppressed, may
lead to a more democratic society, one that
emerges from the behaviour of its citizens
rather than from structures and laws.
If one accepts that the building of a demo¬
cratic society depends more on citizens than on
laws, institutions and structures, then women
will have an essential contribution to make.
And full use has not yet been made of their
capacities.
We should be seeking to create democratic
citizens, with the school working hand in hand
with the family to foster democratic education.
production. In the society of the future, non-
standardized production will become increa¬
singly sought-after.
Untapped potential
In social life too, women seem to have capaci¬
ties which will be important for the future the
capacity to create solidarity, to establish priori¬
ties, and to reject hierarchies.
Traditionally women have sought group
solidarity. They exchange information about
their children, their old people, matters of
health and so on, as they collect water from the
village well and as they meet in the super¬
market. Whatever changes technology may
bring, women will be unlikely to give up this
exchange with each other. At moments of great
distress in time of war, revolution, natural
catastrophe, during refugee movements this
capacity has been vital. The capacity of women
to create solidarities and to understand and live
with people from different cultures and back¬
grounds can make an enormous contribution
to the building of a democratic culture.
Men and women, citizens
and constructors of a
democratic culture.
Versatility and flexibility
are two qualities which
women are often compelled
to develop by force of
circumstance.
Although much has been accomplished already,
much still remains to be done. The education
system has undoubtedly changed for the better
since the late 1960s, but in some countries there
is plenty of room for improvement.
A democratic culture emerges from the shar¬
ing of values, however differently expressed,
and from behaviour related to shared values.
Only thus can a culture be built. There can be
no democratic society without democratic citi¬
zens to construct it. Citizens rather than ideas,
structures or institutions must be the starting-
point. Û 43

THE ARTIST
AS INSECT
byAndré Brink
44
IN this age of violence and strife, terrorism
and famine, multinational corporations and
global power alliances, we have understand¬
ably abandoned Shelley's romantic faith in
poets as the unacknowledged legislators of the
world. Yet there is reason to believe that
without the poet, the intellectual, the artist, the
creator, life might be even worse.
If it is always prudent to remind ourselves
that no single society in the world dares call
itself totally free or totally democratic, I am
mainly concerned here with those societies
which, having emerged only recently from
various forms of absolutism and political
oppression, are now groping towards defini¬
tions of democracy and freedom of which, as in
Czechoslovakia or Germany, they have been
deprived for a long time or which, as in the case
of South Africa, they have never known.
The territory of the intellectual and the
creator is culture: it is that territory in which
the private and the public interact in order to
transform the raw matter of experience into
meaning. No wonder that, in a state of oppres¬
sion, culture should function in particularly
intense ways. For decades, samizdat in Central
Europe has provided a vibrant and electrically
charged cultural experience. In Chile, when no
other forms of protest were allowed by the
Pinochet regime, illiterate washerwomen began
to record, in embroidery and weaving and
appliqué, the passionate experiences of an
entire generation otherwise doomed to obli¬
vion. In a South Africa dehumanized by apar¬
theid, when successive States of Emergency vir¬
tually smothered overt resistance, when
children were killed and women maimed and
men blown up by parcel bombs, a veritable
explosion in the arts in dance and music, in
photography and painting and sculpture, in
poetry and the theatre ensured that the
oppressed black masses were activated in soli¬
darity and awareness, and that even the
conscience of a white ruling minority was cease¬
lessly assailed and provoked into a discovery
of what was really happening behind the
façades of official lies, distortions and half-
truths. Even on the basic level of disseminating
information, artists were performing an invalu¬
able function.
Now comes a transitional stage fraught with
difficulties and danger. Much of this derives
from a clash between different notions of "cul¬
ture". And it seems to me that in our attempts
to formulate the role of culture in the precar¬
ious movement towards freedom and the
function of the intellectual creator within that
process, much of our effort should be directed
towards a redefinition of culture and of the aes¬
thetic which forms an integral part of it.
On the one hand there is the Great Tradi¬
tion of the West, of a Capital-C-Culture for the
privileged few. And how can one reject a tradi¬
tion which has bequeathed to us Sophocles,
Dante, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Rembrandt,
Mozart, Tolstoy, Proust, Kafka and Picasso?
At the same time this tradition becomes prob¬
lematic if it is seen, as it so often is, as exclusivist,
deriving from a Greek model state which could
afford the luxury of distinguishing between
manual labour and mental exertion only
because the presence of enough slaves made it
possible for full citizens to devote their time to
"higher pursuits"?
In this respect a culture of struggle against
oppression brought a valuable corrective, since
it activated, not individual artists only, but the
masses, the whole of an oppressed people. This

grassroots culture has opened, for all societies
closed until very recently, new vistas of invalu¬
able opportunities. Yet this culture, too, can
be demonstrated to harbour seeds of destruc¬
tion: directed, through the exigencies of
oppression, only towards a struggle for poli¬
tical liberation, the field of focus of such a cul¬
ture threatens to become extremely narrow and
immediate. What is not expedient, what cannot
be sloganized or digested immediately, what
does not offer itself as a praxis, as "a weapon
for liberation", is all too easily discounted or
discarded. The problem of this vision of cul-

ture, and of the role of the intellectual/creator
in it, does not lie in the fact that it summons
culture to fulfil a political function, but that it
conceives of culture only in function of its poli¬
tical usefulness.
A well-known anecdote told by the Spanish
poet Federico García Lorca illuminates the
problem. A rich farmer and a peasant are walk¬
ing along a river bank on a particularly beau¬
tiful morning. Moved by the scenery, the rich
man stops to exclaim, "Isn't it beautiful? Look
at those trees ... the clouds ... the reflections!"
But the peasant can only clutch his stomach, 45

groaning, "I am hungry, I am hungry, I am
hungry!" This has often been interpreted to
suggest that aesthetics are obscene; that our
needs are first of all material. But such an inter¬
pretation is an insult to our humanity. The poor
and the oppressed do indeed require food, and
shelter, and comfort. But to suggest that beauty
or excellence are attainable only at the expense
o/what are alleged to be more "basic" needs is a
denial of what makes us human. The needs of
the mind are as essential as those of the body. It
is not enough that we live; we also need to ask
questions about living: we need to pursue, inces¬
santly, the endless possibilities of meaning in
life. And this defines culture as a key dimension
of any society's movement towards a fuller
experience of freedom and democracy.
But what role is to be assigned to the indivi¬
dual intellectual or artist in this process?
Our secular world has no room any more
for Carlyle's "poet as hero", for the lone thinker
or creator as vates, as prophet or priest or visio¬
nary. In the clamour of a people the vox cla¬
marías is all too often drowned, or ignored. It is
so easy to fade into irrelevance. In an endan¬
gered society, threatened by authoritarian rule,
the single dissident voice that dares cry out may
acquire an inordinate resonance. It can become a
rallying point for the oppressed masses. But
once the masses have begun to shake off their
most visible shackles, once a people as a whole
has broken down its walls and fences, has
thrown open its prisons and its Gulags and its
Robben Islands, what role is left for the indivi-
46
dual artist? Is his or her function not superseded
by the collective needs of the people?
If the individual persists as a function of an
obsolete elitist tradition, then indeed there can
be little, if any, justification for him. (And I
say "him" advisedly, as this kind of function is
essentially male and chauvinist by nature.) The
individual as "free agent" is a figment of the
mind, a person without history, ultimately a
person without conscience, who denies or
ignores his utter involvement in the whole rich
fabric of the world. Yet the opposite notion,
that of the "commissar", Stalin's "cultural
worker", is also suspect: he (again it is essen¬
tially a male function) acts primarily as an agent
of power and of bureaucracy.
For this reason the culturally significant
individual should be redefined as a creative and
intellectual being with social, historical and
moral responsibilities. Such a person can fulfil
an indispensable function within the processes
that propel a society towards democracy.
This function, as I sec it, is that of a compo¬
site insect.
First, it is the function of Gregor Samsa
who, one morning, woke up to find himself
"transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect".
Terrifying his family and acquaintances into a
rediscovery of themselves, a redefinition of
their own individual and collective roles, he is
rejected and "misread" by all. In the end he is
starved to death; he becomes forever "the thing
next door". He becomes society's Other; he
forces society to acknowledge its own alterity.
Even if it tries to deny him, it will never be the
same again. At the end of the story his sister
"sprang to her feet first and stretched her
young body": femininity and youth affirm
themselves through her; the possibility of
rebirth and renewal is admitted to the once
stale world of habit and convention.
A second insect to bear in mind is the bee in
the French novelist Jean Paulhan's essay
"L'abeille". If you catch a bee in your hand,
says Paulhan, it will sting you before you crush
it to death. This may not amount to much; yet
had it not been so, there would not have been
any bees left in the world.
My third insect is very humble indeed. It is
the gadfly of Socrates, described by the critic
Tzvetan Todorov in his recent essay "Les taons
modernes". Superficially the gadfly is nothing
but a nuisance, leaving nothing and no-one in
peace or at ease, but in the final analysis it is a
restless questioning spirit which acts to "reveal
and possibly to modify the complex of values
which serves as guiding principle to the life of a
cultural group".
A fourth insect which serves as model to the
intellectual/creator is the cricket in Miroslav
Krleza's "The Cricket below the Waterfall".
This is how the main character in the story des- '
cribes it:
"I discovered a cricket in the men's room,
my dear fellow; down there in the men's room
I discovered a cricket. Underneath the waterfall
that splashes over the putrid black-tarred wall,
where the citron slices float and the smell of
ammonia bites our nostrils as in some labora¬
tory, right down there at the very dregs of the
human stench, one night I heard the voice of
]]>

the cricket. There wasn't even a dog in the pub,
the wind roared like a wild beast, and in the
stench of the men's room was a voice of the
ripe summer, the redolence of August, the
breath of meadows surging like green velvet:
the voice of the cricket out of the urine and
faeces, the voice of nature that transforms even
stinking city toilets into starry sunsets, when
the mills arc softly humming in the russet
horizon, and the first crickets announce them¬
selves as the harbingers of an early autumn.
Here, you see, I've brought him some bread¬
crumbs. Come, let's pay him a visit."
In order to keep alive this faith in something
beautiful, something meaningful, in a sordid
world; in order constantly to shock the world
out of complacency; in order to prod the human
mind into that kind of awareness which never
takes yes for an answer, the first allegiance of the
creator-intcllectual-artist is to his or her
conscience, not to a party or a group, not even
to a cause, not even to "the people". But and
this is the crux of the matter unless that
conscience is forged in action and in commu¬
nion with others, with "the people", and unless
the most private of its discoveries is informed by
the acknowledgement of a total involvement in

the history the past, the present, the future
of its society, it has no weight and no relevance.
Whether the individual creator wills it or
not, whatever he or she does, or neglects to do,
in a society still groping towards democracy, is
allied to one of the two great social dimensions
involved in the process: that of the erstwhile
power establishment, the haves, the oppressors;
or that of the erstwhile victims, the have-nots,
the oppressed. The moral choice is obvious.
Yet there is no point in simply promoting or
advancing a cause, however worthy it may be
in itself. And before we can accede to a fuller
awareness of the truly democratic, we need to
be liberated as much from the mentality of
"victim" as from that of "oppressor". This is
why our composite insect acquires such vital
importance.

forced into subservience to, any cause or ideo¬

lies the assumption of his or her full responsibi¬

through which a people numbed by oppression

democracy and greater freedom. Q 47

NEWSBRIEFS
SPOTLIGHT ON THE
AMERINDIANS
The Amerindians provided the
theme for a number of recent
events organized by Unesco or
with Unesco support on the
occasion of the Fifth Centenary
of the Encounter between Two
Worlds (1492-1992). A week-
long Amerindian Film Festival
held at Unesco's Paris
headquarters featured some
fifteen films illustrating the
diversity and resilience of
Amerindian cultures and offering
an opportunity for reflection
about the future prospects of
the Amerindian peoples. In
October, ten elders of North
American Indian tribes attended
a ceremony held to inaugurate
the "Vaisseau d'Archipel", a 40-
metre high, 10-metre wide
symbolic statue in the French
town of Montbéliard. During the
ceremony, the elders delivered a
message for the third
millennium. Meanwhile, a book
has been published on the first
contacts between Europeans
and the indigenous peoples of
the New World in Mexico, North
America and the Far North,
three regions that have hitherto
been studied separately. The
book, a collective work entitled
Destins Croisés, was produced
in connection with the Unesco-
supported PREGANEM study
programme on different aspects
of the Encounter between
Europe and America.
Its joint publishers are Albin
Michel (Paris), Unesco and
PREGANEM.
GROUPS IN GUINEA, CHINA
AND INDIA HONOURED FOR
LITERACY WORK
On 8 September, Unesco marked
the 27th International Literacy

international literacy prizes at
Expo' 92, the Universal
Exhibition at Seville (Spain).
Guinea was awarded the
International Reading
Association Prize for outstanding
functional literacy work
performed in connection with its
agricultural rehabilitation project
in the Fouta Djallon region. The
Noma prize, created by the late
Japanese publisher Shoichi
Noma, went to the Education
Commission of Xinjiang Uigur
Autonomous Region in China for
its success in significantly
reducing illiteracy, while the King
Seejong Literacy Prize
sponsored by the Republic of
Korea was awarded to the
Movement for Light of
Knowledge, which has been
instrumental in eradicating basic
illiteracy in Pondicherry state, in
India. According to statistics
compiled by Unesco, almost one
thousand million people
throughout the world still cannot
read and write and more than
100 million children in the 6 to
11-year age-group have never
attended school.

invited to Unesco Headquarters
in Paris from 7 to 17
September, in order to swap
experiences about the activities
in which they are engaged.
Ranging in age from 18 to 27,
they came from Belarus, Brazil,
Colombia, Gabon, Germany,
Ghana, India, Indonesia, New
Zealand, Saint Lucia, Spain, Sri
Lanka, the United States and
Yemen. This international
meeting, the second of its kind,
was held as part of Unesco's

EDUCATION FOR AIDS
PREVENTION
Education has a vital role to play
in the prevention cf Aids, not
only as a means of passing on
information but as a way of
changing attitudes towards the
disease, the spread of which is
assuming alarming proportions.
In conjunction with the World
Health Organization (WHO)
Unesco is engaged in a joint
programme of Aids education in
schools, which will soon be
extended to include the informal
(or out-of-school) sector. Unesco
has set up at its Paris
Headquarters a documentation
centre for the collection,
exchange and circulation of
teaching materials for young
people of school age. It contains
more than 1,000 publications
and 120 video films from all the
world regions, which may be

For a democratic
culture
Aviable democracy is inconceivable in the absence
of an authentic democratic culture. This culture
of democracy seems to me to be a space that per¬
mits the synthesis of four fundamental concepts: citizen¬
ship, tolerance, education, and the free exchange of ideas
and people.
Citizenship ? "The renewal of citizenship is not a by¬
product but on the contrary a precondition of demo¬
cracy," Vaclav Havel has written. "Citizenship is cour¬
age, love of the truth, an ever-alert conscience, a freedom
within us and a freely accepted responsibility for public
life. We can never be certain that we can fully live up to
these values."
This analysis sets the ethical dimension in the fore¬
front of citizenship. This ethic, itself fed by values which
we must one day dig deep into ourselves to rediscover,
reflects both our common humanity and notwithstand¬
ing all the diversity in concepts and in practice the
universal basis of democracy.
Tolerance? A democratic culture is based on the
understanding and acceptance of other cultures. It
expresses the will to coexist with others. How many
authoritarian systems have lodged their power in the
celebration of racial distinction and ethnic prejudice! Yet
cultural identities are hardly homogeneous. The richest
among them incorporates the seeds and fruits of the
most widely separated cultures and the most disparate
civilizations. If I were asked what it is today that creates
"the wealth of nations", I would not refer to their tech¬
nological power or their economic might. I would speak
of the capacity of their citizens whatever their origins,
the colour of their skins, the land or the language of their
ancestors to join together in support of a certain
number of ideals and principles which make it possible
for them to live together.
Tolerance does not only mean patience toward
others: it implies a knowledge of others but even more a
respect for the beauty of their cultures. Tolerance is
therefore as much an ethical as an aesthetic attitude.
Rather than dwelling on discrimination, I wish to
emphasize the role of tolerance in promoting integration.
How, for example, can we reconcile the double imper¬
ative essential to all citizenship of unity and freedom,
of membership of the community and individual liberty?
Can we, in societies that are increasingly diversified,
continue to identify democracy with majority rule if the
latter cannot guarantee the expression and adequate pro¬
tection, as part of public life, of the demands and beliefs of
all groups of citizens? Can we even conceive of demo¬
cracy if we do not believe in the need to protect minority
rights?
A truly democratic culture should deny no specific
identity, be it ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural, any
more than it should develop at the expense of national
identity, collective solidarity and the shared hopes of all.
Such a democratic culture offers everyone the opportu¬
nity of self-identification through pluralistic and freely
assumed loyalties. Thus at the cultural level, democracy
must be what it is at the political level: a fusing of per¬
sonal will with the general interest.
Education? It is clear that a democratic culture,
insofar as it defines people as being capable of making
choices, cannot develop freely in the barren soil of igno¬
rance, any more than it can flourish in a social setting
that remains a mosaic of isolated groups, unable to com¬
municate among themselves other than by prejudice and
violence. Ignorance strengthens dictatorships and
enfeebles democracy. Education lies at the very heart of
democratic culture.
Finally, the free exchange of ideas and of people. The
free exchange of people permits them to choose personal
lifestyles and modes of expression, and gives them
greater control over their individual and collective fate.
Total freedom of information and expression is the corn¬
erstone of democratic culture, insofar as such freedom
alone can ensure the transparency that is indispensable to
the exercise of choice and responsibility.
The choice and responsibility of which I speak are
exercised not merely at the level of the community or
nation, but at all levels, ranging from the immediate envi¬
ronment all the way to the ecosystem itself. True citizen¬
ship must be learned and put to the test in the neighbour¬
hood, the family, the workplace, voluntary associations
and, of course, in the daily exercise of public freedoms at
village or municipal levels.
True citizenship is also put to the test globally, notably
in our assumption of responsibility for the environment,
its preservation or its irreversible degradation; and in the
limits which by the choices we make or fail to make
now we impose on the rights of future generations.
To learn to coexist with our environment; to learn to
coexist with other cultures these are, in my opinion, the
major challenges confronting us as the twentieth century
draws to a close. I am convinced that only an authentic
culture of democracy because it is a convivial culture
will allow us to meet these challenges with success. Q

MUSIC FROM AROUND
THE WORLD
Chocolate. Cante Flamenco
CDOcoraHM83
Born in Jerez de la Frontera,
Antonio Nunez Montoya, known as
"Chocolate", works in the cante
jondo ("deep song") tradition of
Spanish music. Accompanied by the
guitarist José Luis Postigo, he turns
his proud, gypsy voice to all the
traditional flamenco styles soléa,
siguiriya, malagueña, taranto,
fandango, and sevillana. Rich and
poetic, his lyrics, which are often
autobiographical in content, take
off on fantastic and surreal
trajectories, shifting abruptly, in the
manner of some Cuban songs, from
reflections on human misery to
evocations of fruit or descriptions of
the women he has loved. This is
flamenco of the highest quality.
Brazil. TheBororo World ofSound.
Musics and Musicians of the World
CD Unesco D 8201
The Unesco Musics and
Musicians of the World series here
presents recordings of the Bororo
Indians of Brazil, a people much
written about by structural
anthropologists. Sporting
magnificent feather head-dresses
(as well as jeans and Bermuda
shorts, to judge by the record cover),
the Bororos still live close to nature
in the Mato Grosso rainforest.
Music-making is a collective, ritual
activity for them. The harsh
rhythms of their songs, which are
often monochord, evoke those of
North American Indians. This
extremely interesting CD is a
contribution to the urgent task of
preserving the cultural heritage of a
threatened people.
Canada. Inuit Games and Songs.
Musics and Musicians of the World
CD Unesco D 8032
The Inuit (or Eskimos, a term
now considered pejorative) are
currently enjoying a political and
cultural revival. This recording of
their games and songs some
imitating animal noises
demonstrates the wide range of
sounds they can produce. The vocal
effects may be clipped or raucous,
smooth or sometimes even
childlike, while the rhythmic
breathing recalls the trance sessions
of Jamaican fundamentalist
churches. The seeming monotony
of the songs is disconcerting at first,
for they have little variation of pitch,
but one soon begins to detect the
nuances. Their scansion and
emphatic rhythms bring to mind
other Amerindian musical
traditions, illustrating the diversity
and underlying unity ofAmerica's
pre-Columbian peoples.
Musical Sources.
CD Unesco D 8100
In its Traditional Musics of the
World series Unesco has recently
brought out an exciting new
compilation of music from different
countries, including a Japanese
Buddhist ritual, Easter liturgies from
Sicily and the Syrian Orthodox
Church, Gurara melodies from the
Algerian Sahara, and instrumental
music from Hong Kong. This
imaginative selection of little-
known material, some ofwhich was
previously unavailable, gives an idea
of the wealth of musical traditions
around the world.
POPULAR MUSIC
Tito Rodriguez. Hits.
CD WS Latino 118
Nicknamed the "Puerto-Rican
Billy Eckstine", Rodriguez used to
top the bill at New York's famous
Palladium Ballroom. A star of Latin-
American music in the 1950s and
1960s, he won a huge following with
his voice and charisma. His biggest
hits, including "Vuelva la paloma",
"Cuando, cuando, cuando" and
"Cara de payaso", were recorded
around 1962. Accompanied by his
own band, with its rich brass
section, Rodriguez offers uptempo
mambos, spicy guarachas and
lyrical boleros that stand
comparison with the best today's
salsa outfits can offer. It is a real
pleasure to have his best tracks
available on compact disc.
Creole Orchestras (1930-40).
Quand Paris biguinait.
CD MM 30876
Black music had its heyday in
Paris in the pre-war years when
Cuban, Caribbean and Afro-
American revues were staged in
nightspots such as the Moulin
Rouge, the Bal Nègre, the Boeuf sur
le Toit and the Ambassadeurs. The
capital swayed to the rhythms of the
rumba, the conga and the beguine,
the latter made popular by the
clarinettist Alexandre Stellio in 1929.
This CD brings together the best
Caribbean artists of the era: the
Créol's Band, the Boule Blanche,
Madame Ma'iotte Almaby and her
Island Orchestra, Roger Fanfan and
his Guadeloupean Orchestra.
Clarinets feature prominently in
both the beguine and the mazurka,
whose polyphonic orchestration is
sometimes reminiscent of New
Orleans jazz. The piano parts are
closer in spirit to nineteenth-
century Romantic music, while the
short lead-in to "Matado-la" echoes
West African chants. Playful
numbers with titles like "Boussu A
ou la Danse de Bam Bam", "Doudou
Moin dans Bras Moin" and "Dans
Trou CrabTa" give off a fine scent of
rum and vanilla.
Mahalia Jackson. Gospels,
Spirituals, & Hymns.
2 CDs Columbia 468663
This compilation of Mahalia
Jackson's greatest hits includes her
masterpiece, "In the Upper Room".
It features sprituals, hymns brought
over from Europe by the early
Protestant settlers, and post-1940s
urban gospel songs from Chicago
and elsewhere, with more elaborate
scores that reflect the influence of
soul music and jazz. Sometimes
Mahalia is backed by choirs, at
others by organ, piano and rhythm
section. In either case her rich
vibrato sends shivers down the
spine. Jackson is the supreme voice
ofAfro-American religious music,
and this record represents the
summit of her art.
JAZZ
Stan Getz/Kenny Barron. People
Time.
2 CDs. Gitanes Jazz
Emarcy 510 134-2
Recorded shortly before he died,
these tracks evince the musical
understanding between Stan Getz
and his last pianist, Kenny Barron.
Many standards are included,
among them "Night and Day", "East
of the Sun" and "I Remember
Clifford", all of which Getz plays
with his customary smoothness.
Many contemporary pianists, used
to having the bass back up with the
basic notes, find it extremely hard to
improvise without this backing.
Barron's tuneful solos are as fresh as
ever, revealing him once more to be
one of the most alert and discreet
musicians on the jazz scene today.
Gilbert Sigrist Trio. Number 1.
Gilbert Sigrist (piano), Laurent
Sigrist (bass guitar), Francis
Winninger/André Ceccarelli (drums).
CD Columbia 468228 2
The pianist Gilbert Sigrist, a pupil
ofNikita Magaloff at the Geneva
Conservatoire, took a risk in
deciding to devote a record to jazz
interpretations of French children's
songs such as "Le petit navire", "A la
claire fontaine" and "La mère
Michel", but the results on this CD
prove that the gamble has paid off.
Sigrist's piano styling is sensitive
and original, its subtle harmonies
sometimes suggesting impressionist
influences. Particularly successful is
the enchanting "Petite rêverie", his
own composition. Sigrist brings a
breath of fresh air to jazz at a time
when it is increasingly in thrall to
technology.
