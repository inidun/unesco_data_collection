The authorities can no longer sideline
the MST when it comes to agricultural
issues. By building a participatory and
egalitarian structure that goes against the
grain, it offers alternative perspectives to
broad  swathes  of  Brazilian  society. Its
adversaries denounce its political radica-
lism and illegal methods, while its defen-
ders call it Latin America’s most promi-
sing social movement. Brazilian econo-
mist Celso Furtado goes so far as to say
that it offers “the only answer to mass
u n e m p l oyment  in  Brazil” because  “ a
return to subsistence agriculture is prefe-
rable  to  urban  poverty.” The  MST  is
facing this challenge with the slogan of
“Agrarian reform:everyone’s struggle.”n
