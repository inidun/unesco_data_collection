A YEAR
UNDER THE SIGN
OF THE BOOK
"All that Mankind has done,
thought, gained or been; it is
lying as in magic preservation in
the pages of books." Thomas
Carlyle. Right, "The Librarian",
by the Italian painter Giuseppe
Arcimboldo (1527-1593).

f%S it passed the mid-point
there was evidence that International
Book Year was catching hold all over
the world. Upwards of 100 countries
were carrying out national plans. Pub¬
lishers, authors, librarians, book¬
sellers and their national and inter¬
national organizations were united in
unprecedented fashion behind the ob¬
jectives of the Year. Trade unions,
welfare groups, churches and youth
organizations were enlisting their mem¬
bers in special book activities. Press,
radio and television were focussed on
books. Mail pouring in to the Unesco
Secretariat signalled a great ground-
swell of public support.
What are the main issues of Inter¬
national Book Year? First, there is a
book shortage so acute in many parts
of the world as to be called a "book
famine". Second, there are not
enough authors to meet the immense
hunger for reading matter. Thirdly,
until the reading habit becomes in¬
grained, books cannot play their full
role in promoting social and economic
development. Finally, there is growing
concern about the content of books in
relation to educational advancement
and international understanding.
It is precisely these four issues that
were singled out by Unesco's General
Conference when it decided by
acclamation to proclaim 1972 as Inter¬
national Book Year. These are like¬
wise the main subjects of this issue of
the "Unesco Courier".

JULIAN BEHRSTOCK la Director of Unesco's
Office of Free Flow of Information, which is
responsible for International Book Year.
He organized the series of Unesco book
development meetings for Asia (1966), Africa
(1968), Latin America (1969), and the Arab
States (1972). Before joining Unesco, he
was an editor on current history for a U.S.
encyclopaedia.
Examples abound of action taken
throughout the world in response to
this Unesco initiative:
Thailand has initiated free distribu¬
tion of textbooks to students in rural
areas. Malaysia and Rwanda are build¬
ing national libraries. Brazil is install¬
ing public libraries in all commu¬
nities. Dahomey, Ethiopia, Indonesia,
Kenya and Nepal are setting up natio¬
nal book development councils. Japan
and the Arab Republic of Egypt are
convening regional book development
conferences.
International Pen, the well-known
writers' organization, has launched a
programme for multi-national publica¬
tion of children's books. The Tokyo
Book Development Centre has start¬
ed a "reading materials project" involv¬
ing joint publication of books for chil¬
dren in Asian languages. More than a
score of countries are offering special
literary and translation prizes.
The French Government is present¬
ing six literary classics as a gift to
each couple who get married this year.
A foundation in the United States is
offering one million books for students
and libraries in Asia in 1972. The
Federal Republic of Germany is en¬
couraging the reading habit among
students by placing posters in every
classroom in the country.
The U.S.S.R. is convening a Unesco
symposium in Moscow on "Books in
the Service of Peace, Humanism and
Progress". Canada will hold a meeting
for the establishment of an Interna¬
tional Association of University Pres¬
ses. India, as part of national book
celebrations, has launched a nation¬
wide campaign for "books for the mil¬
lions".
What explains this extraordinary
surge? What accounts for the fervour,

the almost emotional overtone of much
of the reaction? After all, books have
existed for many hundreds of years.
International Years are enterprises so
vast in scope that they almost inevita¬
bly tend to be impersonal in character.
It is difficult to single out any one
reason. The overriding impression,
however, is that International Book
Year has evoked a latent feeling, far
more widespread and profound than
anyone ever realized, of the impor¬
tance of books. In a world in wh?:h
books have come to be taken for
granted, there is a sudden realization
of what reading could mean.
As' one legislator put it when h.s
country's Parliament proclaimed Inter¬
national Book Year: "Scarcely a lit¬
erate man or woman lives today who
cannot point to at least one book
which has influenced his life in some
way". This personal reaction is the
recurring theme in a host of state¬
ments ranging from newpaper edit¬
orials to messages from national
leaders. Monarchs, presidents, prime
ministers, ministers of education and
culture have noted the effects of read¬
ing on their own development.
The celebrations have a festive note.
Book fairs are being held in all con¬
tinents. Brightly illustrated book pos¬
ters adorn shop windows, kiosks and
libraries, and find an unaccustomed
place on public billboards. Special
commemorative stamps are being issu¬
ed in a sizeable number of countries,
while other countries are post-marking
all letters with IBY slogans. Postage
stamps and posters alike, no less than
book jackets, letter-heads, book mar¬
kers and shopping bags, are making
use of the IBY symbol: two jaunty
figures linking arms within bookcovers,
which has become the hallmark of
Book Year throughout the world.
International non-governmental org¬
anizations were Unesco's allies at the
planning stage of Book Year and this
link has been maintained by the crea¬
tion of an international Support Com¬
mittee made up of representatives of
authors, publishers, booksellers, libra¬
rians and documentalists. One of its
first activities was the adoption of a
statement setting forth in ten articles
the principles that should apply to
books. This Charter of the Book,
which has been placed on the agenda
of meetings all over the world, pro¬
mises to be one of the lasting accom¬
plishments of International Book Year.
1972 may indeed mark a turning
point in the long history of the book
by helping to translate into reality the
IBY slogan "Books for AN". If that hap¬
pens, it will be in large part because
1972 was "International Book Year
for All".
